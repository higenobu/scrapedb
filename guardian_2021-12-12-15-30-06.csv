12/12/2021,"There’s maybe nothing as naked as a winter larch. Like a sphinx cat, at first it looks wrong, as if there is something missing – newly bald, needle-less. The journey here, though, is remarkable. The baby-soft new green in spring. The metamorphosis in autumn. Oranges, yellows, branches like fluffy tiger tails.  I planted two tiny saplings in Denmark 14 years ago. They are giants now. We are here for a quick week to see my mother-in-law, in remission from being poorly. The pain has for now near-miraculously gone. There is lots to do on the plot. Remarkably, there hasn’t yet been a frost. And this from a place where the northern sea sometimes freezes. Locals have been known to drive over the ice. The nasturtiums have spread out like extravagant octopuses. Multi-limbed, luxuriant, jewelled with dew. Most of the trees have long turned; the last hanging leaves coloured old gold and rust. The twin oaks have dumped countless barrowloads. Smothering, leathery. My hands blister with gathering some of it up. The grass too long, dotted with herb robert and other flowers. Henri’s hands are blistered, too: from planting narcissi bulbs. It’s dry, so we fix the mower at its highest setting. Henri trims. It works. We spread some of the broken leaf on the borders. As always there is too much to do in the time we have away from remote working. We pick the last apples from the old-style Danish tree: Ingrid Marie from Funen. Henri makes her pie. We store the rest of the fruit in the garden shed, hoping the mice have left. We have a polecat that moves into the roof most winters. I reluctantly block its most obvious path and scatter broken-up fat balls to placate the pheasant who shrieks indignantly under the hanging feeders. We still need to thin out random cherry trees, bird-sown. But that will wait until we are back, at Christmas. Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.

12/12/2021,"The question Several times in my childhood I was sexually abused by different men, starting from age six. I was raised as the oldest child of a single mum who often struggled to cope. Having also raised kids on my own – both are now adults – I understand the challenges and exhaustions of sole parenting. However, I don’t understand a number of neglectful decisions she made, including leaving one or all of us in the care of unknown adults or, worse, adults who were suspected of abusive behaviour, for overnight stays. Understanding that Mum is emotionally vulnerable has meant my siblings and I don’t raise these issues with her in the interests of keeping the peace. Even so, in recent years Mum has made a habit of raising the issue of my assaults unprompted, to explain that she wasn’t a bad parent. Or she will invoke a conversation about how she was a good mother, then she brings up a traumatic incident that she insists wasn’t her fault.  I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD due to the assaults. I cannot see any choice other than to cut communication with Mum to manage the distress her behaviour causes and I am in the process of seeking counselling. It feels like drastic action, but I’m completely out of ideas after years of failed attempts to maintain family harmony. Philippa’s answer I’m sorry all this happened to you and that you still live with the consequences of it. Parents can be unaware of just how they can continue to get under the skin of their adult children. You hate her bringing up the subject of your abuse, but I wonder what it would mean to you, to hear your mother say something like: “I made terrible mistakes when you were a child. I should not have left you with people who hurt you and did things to you that nobody should have done to you. I am sorry I could not do better. I am regretting this very much. I wish I could take it out of your life. I am sorry that I caused so much pain.” And then how it would be for you if she never again mentioned it, unless you brought up the subject? Would that be enough to make it tolerable to be with her? I can imagine it might feel agonising for your mother to admit that her actions had bad consequences that you still live with. Or that she had had a choice about them. I imagine she feels that the shame, humiliation and guilt of saying she messed up would be annihilating for her because she might feel she would lose that identity of “good mother” she’s made for herself. She doesn’t want to feel obliterated, so she wants to be right. Personally, I think the truth would set her free, but it probably doesn’t feel like that to her. If you award her that “good mother” label what happens to your experience? Would it be like denying what your experience has been? The appellations of “good” or “bad” mother are never helpful. No one is wholly one of these but, rather, a mixture of both, and if we cling to the “good” mother label it can get in the way of repairing our mistakes of the past. Sometimes, all we can do is ask for what we want. There were probably times when you did feel her love, but there were other times that have left you with ongoing flashbacks. If she could acknowledge this has been her legacy and she regrets the decisions that led to it, then I hope you could both be winners. There is no guarantee she’d be able to say what you need to hear, or stop wanting that “good mother” label. What is in your power to change, you have got in motion. You are seeking out counselling and when you work through all your experiences and feelings and have them validated, it may bring you some peace. Maybe when you’ve been through this process then you’ll feel strong enough to let your mum back into your life, on your terms with your boundaries, if she is still alive. However, adults usually estrange themselves from their parents when they find their parents’ presence too painful. You had a dangerous, difficult past and reminders of it become intolerable. Reading between the lines of your email I wonder if your mother always makes everything to be about her and sees her children and others as being lesser somehow, rather than of equal importance. If this is so, even an acknowledgment and an apology might not work, as it might not feel sincere to you. Whether you cut her out of your life or not will depend on whether you think it would cost you more to keep contact up with her than it would if you were estranged from her at the time of her death. Only you can know that. Maybe showing her your email to me and even the reply might help her choose between insisting she was a “good mother” or owning what the effect of her decisions have had on you. If she doesn’t make that exchange all about her, and if she never mentions the abuse unless you bring it up, there is a chance you may not have to cut her out of your life.

12/12/2021,"Waitrose Mulled Wine, Castilla La Mancha, Spain NV 2.25L (£14.99, Waitrose) I’m not sure mulled wine warrants the full Felicity Cloake, “how to make the perfect …” treatment. There’s no real call for precision. It’s supposed to be thrown together, with all the ingredients followed by that imperiously vague cook’s instruction “to taste” rather than measurements to the last millilitre or gram. Still, I suppose there are some essential elements. Or at least, on each occasion I’ve enjoyed mulled wine the pot has had the same key constituents: clove, cinnamon, star anise, oranges and lemons. And wine, of course, although my preference is for port, which brings more body, depth of flavour and that little extra nip of alcohol even if the pot’s been on the stove a while, as well as being sweet enough not to require added sugar. Still, if you can’t be faffed with making your own, Waitrose’s version, based not on port but a sufficiently robust southern Spanish red, does this once-a-year-job perfectly well. Chairman’s Reserve Spiced Rum (from £23.15, distillersdirect.com; masterofmalt.com; Waitrose) I understand that mulled wine is not to everyone’s taste; that it’s now strongly redolent of city centre squares filled with rows of sheds with speakers blasting Slade and stacks of slightly stale German lebkuchen. So for Christmas fair and mulled wine refuseniks, I am tapping the sign saying: other spiced drinks are available! Mulled cider, perhaps, which, when heavy on the cinnamon and ginger (and with or without a nip of calvados or ginger liqueur), in my view works better than wine as a seasonally warm and spicy drink, playing on much the same range of flavours you’d find in an apple pie. Or, even better, the king of wintry warm booze, hot buttered rum: melted butter, maple syrup or muscovado sugar, a stick of cinnamon, and a good double measure of rum, which, for an extra aromatic festive hit, could be a spiced version such as the luscious Chairman’s Reserve from St Lucia – a drink that is just as good as late night solo sipper, whatever the season.  Luscombe Hot Ginger Beer (£21.30, 12 x 27cl, luscombe.co.uk; £6.85, 4 x 27cl, abelandcole.co.uk) Ginger is the spice that looms largest in my kitchen. It’s my one concession to homeopathy: that fiery heat must surely have some effect in warding off germs and boosting my immune system. And if that proves to be so much wishful thinking, never mind: the root is also the beating heart of some of great Christmas drinks. First among equals, the King’s Ginger Liqueur (£23.50, 50cl, bbr.com) updated its recipe in 2020, which may account for what I thought was a little extra definition the last time I tried it. But this distillate of ginger and lemon peel is not all that different in zingy effect to the original version created for King Edward VII in 1903, and it’s still the thing I’d have in a hip flask on a frosty Boxing Day walk. My other current favourite ginger drink is entirely alcohol free. Quite apart from being delicious – the infusion of spicy heat balanced with tang – and a fine match for Thai curry, Devon fruit drink makers Luscombe’s Hot Ginger Beer may also be the best, head-clearing hangover antidote I’ve ever tried.

12/12/2021,"Every month of Boris Johnson’s premiership brings a new reminder of his rank unfitness for office. As the country is on the verge of an Omicron wave that could pose a profound challenge to the NHS, the government is mired in a deep political crisis entirely of its own making, after a week in which yet more of Johnson’s hypocrisy and corruption have been exposed. A year ago, citizens made huge sacrifices in obeying Covid restrictions to limit the number of individuals who lost their lives in the second wave. As in the first wave of the pandemic, Johnson left it far too late to introduce social restrictions last autumn, with the result that thousands died needlessly and more damage than necessary was inflicted on the economy. But public compliance with restrictions when they were eventually brought in was high, as people did their bit to ease pressure on the NHS and save lives. Relatives missed saying final goodbyes to loved ones with Covid; grandparents missed first Christmases; more people than usual spent Christmas alone. Yet we have discovered that individuals working for the government held Christmas parties across Whitehall, including in No 10, in flagrant breach of the government’s own regulations that so many people abided by, at great personal cost.  Johnson’s claims that he did not know about the reported parties in No 10 or the cultures of entitlement that fuelled them are not credible. No one in government has taken adequate responsibility for what happened. It reveals an abject disregard for the public and has further undermined trust in the government at a critical phase of the pandemic, just when ministers are asking the public to comply with extra Covid measures. The revelations that Johnson’s team had so little respect for the public have prompted a political crisis just at the moment when the government should be focused on what action is needed to combat the Omicron variant. Emerging data has suggested the new variant is far more transmissible than Delta and that a double vaccine provides much less protection against symptomatic infection, although a booster dose is very effective. It is too early to tell the extent to which Omicron is associated with serious illness, hospital admissions and death in a population with the UK’s levels of immunity and age profile, but even if the risk of hospital admissions is half that of Delta, its significant transmissibility advantage means there is a very substantial risk that, without further action, the NHS could be overwhelmed this winter. This is why Professor John Edmunds, one of the government’s scientific advisers, has said Omicron represents a “very severe setback” to hopes of bringing the virus under control. On Wednesday, the government announced it would be introducing its plan B measures: compulsory masks in more settings, Covid passports for nightclubs and large-capacity venues and asking people to work from home if they can. But many experts have raised doubts about whether these will make enough of a difference to the spread of Omicron. While levels of immunity are better than they were last winter, Omicron’s transmission advantage means Johnson now faces a similar decision to last Christmas: should he take precautionary action now in order to avoid tougher social restrictions to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed later? Ministers should be considering further measures, such as extending vaccine passports to all forms of hospitality, and re-extending self-isolation to all contacts of Covid cases, while, as we have long argued, ensuring everyone has access to decent sick pay so they can afford to test if they have symptoms and to self-isolate if positive. Moreover, while boosters have rightly been heralded as the first line of defence against Omicron, many who are officially eligible for the booster dose have been unable to access it due to limited capacity across the UK. The booster programme has proceeded in a more lethargic fashion than the original rollout of vaccines, despite the risk of a more vaccine-resistant strain such as Omicron emerging. There should have been an unrelenting drive within government last week to rapidly expand vaccine capacity across the four nations. But just as Johnson’s sole focus should be on the booster rollout and any further measures needed to combat Omicron, his premiership is being consumed by a self-inflicted political crisis. His political authority in the Conservative party has ebbed away as a result of his terrible handling of the Owen Paterson corruption scandal, the revelations that he misled the government’s adviser on ministerial interests on the funding of the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat and the political fallout of his senior staff holding parties while the country was in lockdown. He faces a significant backbench rebellion over a parliamentary vote on the introduction of plan B, let alone on any further measures. We know Johnson is a man who has elected to put personal interests before country time and again: there is a risk that he is again being too slow to take the action required because he is swayed by retaining the support of newly emboldened rebellious backbenchers. It is a national misfortune that we have a man who is by far and away the worst postwar prime minister in office at the time of the worst postwar crisis. Johnson lacks any shred of integrity, is driven by ego and self-interest and has been prepared to mislead voters over and over again. He is incompetent and embodies the entitled politician who sees politics as a game rather than a duty. He is utterly unfit to govern Britain.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on Boris Johnson | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/12/observer-view-boris-johnson-national-crisis-omicron

12/12/2021,"Phillip Inman’s article on the dire state of local government finances sheds a light on what has been going on for decades, something I witnessed as a councillor on various authorities between 1987 and 2017 (“‘Councils have been short-changed. We need more government money’”, Business). Cllr Jayne Kirkham is pulling her punches when she opines that Cornwall has been “short-changed by the government”. In my opinion, local councils have been systematically emasculated by successive governments, at least since the end of the Second World War. It is time to reform local government finance and structure in England before repatriating some of the powers it used to enjoy. The surviving remnants of the three-tier system in England (county, district, town/parish) need urgently to be replaced by unitary authorities, while retaining and strengthening the town/neighbourhood councils, which would bring English local government broadly in line with its counterparts in the other three UK nations. Council tax needs to be replaced by a local income tax and/or a land value tax. Just don’t give us any more local supremos, aka mayors or governors. Democracy is not safe if it rests in the hands of a single person, regardless of their mandate, as Boris Johnson proves to us every day.John MarriottNorth Hykeham, Lincoln  I have great sympathy with Jayne Kirkham, Labour councillor in Cornwall. Cornwall is indeed one of the poorest regions in Europe and before Brexit was a beneficiary of millions of pounds from the EU social funds. However, Cornish people voted by a majority for Brexit, the Conservatives swept to power in the council elections in May and all six of Cornwall’s Westminster constituencies are blue. I would leave it up to them to sort out. That is local democracy and public accountability. You get what you vote for.Paul GoodmanLoughborough, Leicestershire Sir Jeremy Farrar suggests that, unless there is global vaccination coverage, a new variant is likely to overcome our armoury of vaccines (“Progress on Covid now ‘squandered’, warns expert”, News). Professor Sir Andrew Pollard and Gordon Brown have been saying something very similar for some time. According to the OECD last week, it would cost $50bn (£38bn) to vaccinate the world. If the world’s highest income countries (81, according to the World Bank) had the political will, these countries would only have to contribute £470m each. When we remember that the UK’s track and trace system cost £37bn, £470m is a drop in the ocean. These costs would be greatly reduced if governments approved a waiver of intellectual property rights related to Covid-19 technologies. This is supported by more than 100 governments, but not ours. Global vaccine equality demands that the UK does the right thing and contributes to an urgent vaccination programme. Putting the strong moral argument aside, it is in our own best interests to do so.Phil PowellOxford Come on, Séamas O’Reilly, use your amazing imagination – tomato yoghurt is easily contrived with a spoonful of ketchup added to plain yoghurt (“My son’s Heston Blumenthal potential comes into its own – and means we’re late for nursery”, the New Review). One of my children would not eat yoghurt with bits in, at a time when smooth ones were unavailable, so in typical earth mother mode I would sieve out the bits and he was happy with the result.Catherine RoomeStaplehurst, Kent I agree wholeheartedly that social workers need to engage all their critical skills when assessing parenting behaviour (“Don’t be fooled by deceitful parents, top child expert warns social workers”, News). However, I am less sure that proposing more children should be taken into care is necessarily the solution, given the shortcomings of our current system. We know that children in care are more likely to do poorly in education, to experience problems with physical and mental health and to enter the criminal justice system. As adults, these experiences have a long-term effect and consequently affect their own parenting abilities. Unless we are prepared to invest substantially in a system that does much better for these children, expanding the numbers in care is not the answer.Pam HibbertLlangammarch Wells, Powys While I agree with Jonathan Bouquet that “cathedrals are not theme parks” (“May I have a word?”, Comment), I can’t agree that they were created to instil wonderment, awe and lift the soul. It depended who you were. A secular view is that the awe was engendered by segregation of the masses from the hallowed and secure area of the sanctuary by a screen that gave limited view of the ceremonials undertaken by the hierarchy. The masses had to stand, there were no pews until relatively recently, but the old and infirm could “go to the wall” to sit on stone shelves. Many cathedrals had wall paintings and often sculpture that depicted or promised damnation, torture or the sufferings of saints. It was fear that engendered the “awe” for them. For me, modern, freer access creates the awe. I see cathedrals as art that is made fluid by the additions and changes over the centuries. Perhaps the next wave of fluidity for Notre Dame will again demonstrate that the building is the star and the contents another aspect of change and self-awareness.Jonathan HauxwellCrosshills, North Yorkshire “A cruel tyrant is crushing a democracy.

12/12/2021,"The Black Friar, 41-43 Blackfriars Road, Salford M3 7DB (0161 667 9555). Starters and small plates £5–£15; mains £15–£38; desserts £8–£9; wines from £25 a bottle Viewed from the air, the Black Friar in Salford could look a little like Charlie Bucket’s rackety family home in the original movie of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. It’s a humble old redbrick Victorian building of just two storeys, hemmed in by towering grey stone and steel apartment blocks. It seems to be an afterthought – the corner site that no one thought to develop. And indeed, it was empty and derelict, staring blank-eyed out over the dual carriageway for 15 years. Twice, fires ripped through it. Then the building was refurbished and pressed into service as the marketing suite for the handsome newbuilds going up around it.  Now it’s a pub once more. Step through the corner entrance and it looks much as you would expect: wood floors, a stove with logs stacked on either side, squishy armchairs. It’s a riot of Victoriana lite. There’s Boddingtons, Beavertown and Seven Brothers Easy IPA on draught. But look closer. It quickly becomes clear the original redbrick building has been subsumed into the development around it. There are light and airy modern extensions in all directions. Floors are tiled in a dizzying black and white. Dining rooms with plateglass windows lead down to a space with an open kitchen and shelves stacked with pots of brilliant red-leafed poinsettias. There are patios strung with fairy lights. Keep all that in mind. For this is clearly now a local boozer with a particular locality in mind: the Spectrum development of which it is now a part. After a long day working at the very cutting edge of modern media communications, or whatever it is the denizens of these tidy apartments do, they might peer down upon the pub from their eyrie and decide they can’t be fagged to cook and will instead come down here, to drop £50 a head on dinner. The chef, Ben Chaplin, comes from the glossy 20 Stories in Spinningfields. Don’t therefore expect the food to be confined to essence of British pub. Originally, there were two menus: a casual grazing job for lunchtimes, and then something altogether fancier for the evenings. Coincidently, on the very day I turn up, they have merged them. What you now get is a hybrid. There are pies and terrines and fish and chips from the boozer side of the ledger, and altogether grander things involving truffles and champagne from the fat-walleted end. When I get on to those prices some of you may wish to start curling your noses like the Catherine Tate characters Janice and Ray while shouting, “And this! In Salford! The dirty robbing bastards.” Get it out of your system now. This is an ambitious pub in a Greater Manchester which is evolving quickly. What matters is that the cooking is big and bullish and, for the most part, on point. A slab of boar and pheasant terrine has just the right balance of fat to meat. It’s robustly seasoned and has been allowed to come to room temperature, so that the flavours haven’t been murdered by fridge chill. It’s a testament to the charcutier’s craft. Alongside is a warm brioche roll flecked with truffle and a bold chutney of walnut and pear. If you’re going to pay £10 for a terrine, you want it to look like this. From the shiny restaurant side of things come big fat scallops. Two are seared to that gorgeous golden brown that shouts, “Eat me! Eat me now!” The third is crusted in a black garlic crumb so that it looks not unlike a giant truffle. Then you cut in to find the pearly white. They sit on a velvety white garlic purée, scribbled through with a parsley jelly that has started to melt in the languorous warmth. This is serious cookery: both profoundly beautiful and profoundly eatable. Any bit of the brioche left over from the terrine is quickly pressed into service. There’s a daily pie. The pie liberationists will be pleased to know that it is very much a single item, clad from top to toe in crumbly, flaky puff. Pie purists will agree that if you can’t throw it across a room with one hand, it’s not a pie. This is a pie. Today it’s stacked to the lid with braised chicken and leek and very good it is, too. On the side is a heap of proper mash, crunchy green beans and a jug of hot gravy, which I sip. I tell myself I am doing this for professional reasons, though obviously sipping gravy should be a thing. It is rich and sticky and meaty; the sort you’ll be licking off your lips for hours to come even when it’s long gone. The £17 price tag is on the enthusiastic side. By comparison, the pies at the Windmill in London’s Mayfair cost £16, while, as Janice and Ray might point out, we really are on the edge of a dual carriageway in Salford. A dish of turbot with smoked eel choucroute, champagne velouté and caviar is a brave £32. Turbot is an expensive fish, but for that money the cooking should be spot on. I find myself yearning for the brightness controls you get on an Instagram picture. The turbot, while sensitively cooked, has been heavily seasoned. There’s the dice of already salty smoked eel through the vinegared and shredded cabbage. The frothy champagne velouté is also heftily seasoned and then on top, more symbol of northwestern largesse than vital ingredient, is the spoonful of caviar. It doesn’t need to be there. There’s a very good dish indeed fighting to get out from underneath all this overkill. A side of roast squash under fistfuls of toasted seeds and spiced pine nuts ends up acting as a rather good foil to all the overwrought drama. The dessert list includes the much-loved usual suspects: an apple and blackberry crumble, a sticky toffee pudding, a chocolate fondant. It’s reassuring for all that. We share a beautifully made bitter orange parfait, a gift to marmalade lovers everywhere, which comes with an open-crumbed olive oil cake, a little orange gel and a scoop of soothing labneh. As with everything we are served, even that misfire of a turbot dish, there is attention to detail here. The front-of-house team is well drilled, the drink options are broad and all the various spaces look very pretty indeed. I’d be rather chuffed if the Black Friar was my local. Instead, it’s the local for those now above it, living life at altitude. The supermarket chain Asda is collaborating with the digital food brand and delivery company The Lean Kitchen Network to develop a new instore food counter, featuring what they call some of the “nation’s most loved brands”. What this means is a menu including Cheesy Wotsits Mac ’n’ Cheese and Doritos Loaded Nachos. This stunning victory for new product development will be rolled out to more stores in coming months, alongside a delivery option, should you want a Cheesy Wotsits Mac ’n’ Cheese to arrive at your door. As ever, I am only the reporter. The chef Mitch Tonks, who has just launched a new range of quality tinned fish, has a second new venture.

12/12/2021,"China has responded “irrationally” to the Aukus pact between Australia, the United States and Britain, the defence minister Peter Dutton says. The conservative Australian minister continues to mount forthright criticism of the Chinese government, accusing it of “bullying” countries that stand up to Beijing.  Dutton on Sunday said the Australian government had formed the Aukus partnership with the US and the UK because it wanted to see “see increased stability and peace in our region”. “The response by China to that, I think, was irrational,” Dutton told Sky News Australia. He said it was wrong to suggest Australia was the one fuelling an arms race in the region “when we’re talking about acquiring eight nuclear-powered submarines at a time when China has 355 vessels in its [naval] fleet, going to 400 within the next nine years”. “And they are producing on a tonnage rate more naval assets every 18 months than what the Royal Australian Navy has in its entire fleet,” Dutton said. China has sought to portray the Aukus deal as an “Anglo-Saxon clique” and a threat to the nuclear non-proliferation system. China’s acting ambassador to Australia, Wang Xining, likened Australia to “a naughty guy”, saying it would be branded as a “sabre wielder” rather than a “peace defender” as a result of the plan. But the concerns are not confined to China, with the Australian government moving to allay Malaysia and Indonesia’s worries that the Aukus deal could add to a regional arms race and pose nuclear non-proliferation issues. Tensions with Beijing are set to increase, after Australia joined the US and the UK last week in announcing a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics in protest over human rights abuses in China’s Xinjiang region. China’s foreign ministry said those countries would pay a price for their “mistaken acts” and “posturing”. When asked on Sunday about this threat, Dutton said China issues such comments “regularly and not just against Australia”. The defence minister said China had also “threatened” Lithuania with trade actions in recent weeks, adding: “We see it more and more regularly and it’s unsettling and it’s unnecessary to be honest.” Dutton – who has been accused of ramping up national security rhetoric for political purposes as a federal election looms – said it was important to “be realistic” about how China’s outlook had “changed quite dramatically” under Xi Jinping’s leadership. He said the Australian government’s “problem is with the Chinese government, not with the Chinese people”. He said Australia had “an incredibly successful diaspora community” with more than a million people of Chinese origin “who have made an enormous contribution to our country”. Dutton attracted controversy last month when he said it would be “inconceivable” that Australia wouldn’t come to Taiwan’s aid if the US defended the democratically governed island against an invasion by China. He denied this amounted to pre-committing Australia to war. The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, discussed tensions across the Taiwan Strait during a meeting with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in the UK on Saturday. The US state department said the pair had “reiterated support for a peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues without resorting to threats or coercion and emphasised Taiwan’s important contributions to global health development”. Payne and Blinken met on the sidelines of a G7 foreign and development ministers’ meeting in Liverpool. They also “agreed on the importance of having a Senate-confirmed Ambassador in place in Canberra as soon as possible in light of the scope and scale of shared challenges we face”. The Biden administration is yet to name an ambassador to Australia but there has been speculation that it may nominate Caroline Kennedy, the former ambassador to Japan and daughter of John F Kennedy. Amid continued competition for regional influence, the Australian government announced on Sunday it would join with the US and Japan to fund a new undersea telecommunications cable in the Pacific. The project, estimated to cost up to $A104m, aims to improve internet services in Kiribati, Nauru and the Federated States of Micronesia. Payne said such partnerships “meet genuine needs” and “respect sovereignty”. Regional security will be one of the main topics on the agenda when South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, meets with Australia’s prime minister Scott Morrison in Canberra on Monday.",News/Australia news,"China’s response to Aukus deal was ‘irrational’, Peter Dutton says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/12/chinas-response-to-aukus-deal-was-irrational-peter-dutton-says
12/12/2021,"Vasiliy Lomachenko made his pitch for a lightweight title shot with a masterclass performance that showed why for years he was regarded as boxing’s pound-for-pound best. The two-time Olympic gold medalist and three-weight champion from Ukraine won nearly every round against Richard Commey on Saturday night, dropping the hard-hitting Ghanian in the seventh before cruising to a unanimous-decision win before a crowd of 8,555 at Madison Square Garden.  Lomachenko (16-2, 11 KOs) raced out to an early lead as the gulf in hand speed, footwork and overall ringcraft between the fighters was apparent early on. Commey (30-4, 27 KOs), a former lightweight titleholder, used the jab to keep his opponent’s attacks at bay, but the volume of Lomachenko’s punches were taking their toll by the middle rounds. After he sent Commey crashing to the canvas in the seventh with a concussive hook, Lomachenko twice urged his opponent’s corner to stop the fight. They did not comply and the Ghanian made it it to the final ball on sheer grit and not much else. Lomachenko is looking to fight his way back into the lightweight championship picture after last year’s uncontroversial points defeat to Teófimo López. López’s reign proved short-lived as the 24-year-old Brooklyn native lost the IBF, WBA and WBO titles he captured from Lomachenko in a major upset to Australia’s George Kambosos Jr last month. After Saturday’s fight, Lomachenko said he would happily travel to Australia if it meant another shot at his titles. “I will go anywhere I need to go to fight him,” Lomachenko said. “I need this chance. And if God gives me this chance I’ll take it.” More to follow.",Sport/Sport,Vasiliy Lomachenko targets Kambosos and titles after brushing aside Commey,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/12/vasiliy-lomachenko-richard-commey-fight-kambosos
