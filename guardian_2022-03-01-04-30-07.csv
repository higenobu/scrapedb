3/1/2022,"Jesse Marsch has been confirmed as the new head coach of Leeds United, after the struggling Premier League club moved swiftly to replace Marcelo Bielsa. Indeed Bielsa, sacked on Sunday, had barely had time to bid his players a final farewell at the training ground on Monday morning before his 48-year-old successor became only the second American to manage a Premier League team. #LUFC can today announce the appointment of Jesse Marsch as our new head coach, pending international clearance Speaking about the appointment, the Leeds director of football, Victor Orta, said: “We are delighted to welcome Jesse to the club and excited for him to lead us into this new chapter. Jesse is someone we identified a number of years ago during his time at Red Bull Salzburg and we believe his philosophy and style of football aligns with that of the club and will suit the players very well. We have a long-term plan and firmly believe he can take Leeds United to the next level and are excited for what the future holds.” Leeds fans must trust the former RB Leipzig, Red Bull Salzburg and New York Red Bulls coach is somewhat more successful than his compatriot, Bob Bradley, proved at Swansea a few years ago but no one is underestimating the task confronting Marsch. A manager who shone at Salzburg left Leipzig in December by “mutual consent” following an indifferent five months in charge of the Bundesliga club and must now somehow correct an appalling run of form which has seen Bielsa’s side collect one point from their last six games and concede 20 goals in the past five matches alone. Like Bielsa an advocate of an aggressive high pressing game – albeit using a slightly more moderate model than his Argentinian predecessor – Marsch is much admired in the Elland Road boardroom after striking up a rapport with Victor Orta, Leeds director of football, early in 2020. His first priority in a run of matches starting with Saturday’s trip to Leicester ahead of two vital home games against Aston Villa and Norwich will be to tighten a defence which has conceded 60 top-flight goals this season, more than any other team in the division. Bielsa’s last two games saw Leeds sink 6-0 at Liverpool before losing 4-0 at home to Tottenham. In mitigation Leeds have been without three key players comprising the team’s spine for much of this season and Marsch can only hope that last season’s leading scorer Patrick Bamford, the England central midfielder Kalvin Phillips and the centre-back and captain, Liam Cooper, return to action on schedule this spring. Chief Executive Angus Kinnear added: “We are really pleased to have quickly secured the services of our first-choice head coach. Whilst the short-term objective for Jesse is obvious, we believe he has the courage and ambition to build on the strong foundations we have created over the last four years and elevate the performance of the club over the long-term. He had a great deal of success with New York Red Bulls and Red Bull Salzburg and has demonstrated during our many meetings that he is a great fit with the footballing culture of Leeds United. “At this challenging time, it is important that the club remains united from top to bottom. The fans have been amazing throughout Andrea’s tenure and we have no doubt they will unite behind Jesse and ensure the team quickly returns to winning with style.”",Sport/Football,Leeds United confirm appointment of Jesse Marsch as new manager,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/28/leeds-united-confirm-jesse-marsch-new-manager
3/1/2022,"The UK’s largest book chain, Waterstones, has acquired the country’s largest independent bookseller, Blackwell’s, ending 143 years of family ownership and signalling a further concentration of the bookselling industry. Blackwell’s, which has 18 bookshops, was put up for sale this month after its owners ditched a plan to hand it to employees. The chain will continue to trade under its own brand. The acquisition by Waterstones will see Blackwell’s ultimately fall under the umbrella of American £38.4bn hedge fund Elliott Investment Management, which in 2019 also purchased the largest US bookseller, Barnes & Noble. Along with Waterstones’ acquisition of UK book chain Foyles in 2018, it marks a further contraction in the book retail market. The acquisition will be viewed by some as a regrettable end to the family ownership of a cherished independent and academic bookseller. To others, it will be heralded as a turbo-boost for real-world bookshops in the battle for dominance with online rival Amazon. Toby Blackwell, the outgoing owner and president, said finding new owners had been “an extraordinary challenge”, adding that Waterstones’ purchase of Foyles had demonstrated “they understand the advantages and benefits of holding diverse iconic bookselling brands in their portfolio”. “I view them not just as a buyer of the business, but as the right buyer at the right time,” Blackwell added. “This is a positive outcome for Waterstones, Blackwell’s and all our customers in the UK and abroad, who will still be able to enjoy the individual nature of what both brands offer.” UK book sales continued to climb last year, with more than 212m print books sold in 2021 according to figures by Nielsen BookScan – the highest figure of the last decade. The deal will be financed by ​​funds advised by Elliott Advisors, Waterstones said. Waterstones currently has 291 bookstores across the UK, Ireland, Brussels and Amsterdam. Blackwell’s chief executive David Prescott said the acquisition would “ensure the future” of the bookseller, saying Waterstones had outlined a plan to “invest in our people, our shops and in our growing e-commerce operation”. The cost is expected to be in the “low single-digit millions”, according to the Financial Times, which cited a source close to the talks. “Blackwell’s and Heffers are amongst the most illustrious names in bookselling, a legacy for which we have the utmost respect,” said James Daunt, Waterstones’ managing director. “We greatly look forward to working alongside the booksellers at Blackwell’s as we secure the future of these wonderful bookshops and preserve academic bookselling in so many towns and campuses across the UK,” he added. The Green party peer Natalie Bennett expressed disappointment at the move. “One more homogenisation of our economy – giant companies dominating their sector is the story of our times,” she wrote on Twitter. The Dublin-based independent Gutter Bookshop tweeted that the deal felt “sad and inevitable but hopefully it’s also an opportunity to keep Blackwell’s alive.”",Arts/Books,"Waterstones acquires Blackwell’s, the UK’s biggest independent bookseller",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/28/waterstones-acquires-blackwells-the-uks-biggest-independent-bookseller
3/1/2022,"Britain and New Zealand have signed a free trade deal, which the UK government said would boost bilateral trade by 60% by eliminating tariffs, cutting red tape and enabling freer movement of professional workers. Most business leaders welcomed the deal, which was agreed in principle in October and follows on the heels of a similar agreement with Australia, but the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) said it would lead to unfair competition in their sector. The trade minister, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, forecast that the deal would add £800m to the British economy over the next decade. “Our trade with New Zealand will soar, benefiting businesses and consumers throughout the UK and helping level up the whole country,” she said. Tariffs of up to 10% on clothing and footwear, 5% on buses and up to 5% on ships, bulldozers and excavators will be eliminated, she said. William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, joined the head of the Federation of Small Businesses, Mike Cherry, and the Lord Mayor of London, Vincent Keaveny, in describing the deal as an opportunity for UK businesses to provide services on an equal footing with businesses based in New Zealand. “The agreement will also boost trade in environmental goods and services – essential for the transition to net zero,” Bain added. However, the NFU’s president, Minette Batters, said the elimination of tariffs on agricultural products would expose “sensitive sectors like beef and lamb, dairy and horticulture” to unfair competition. “Once again, there appears to be extremely little in this New Zealand trade deal to benefit British farmers. UK farm businesses face significantly higher costs of production than farmers in New Zealand, and margins are likely to tighten further in the face of rising input costs, higher energy bills and labour shortages,” she said. “The government is now asking British farmers to go toe-to-toe with some of the most export-oriented farmers in the world, without the serious, long-term and properly funded investment in UK agriculture that can enable us to do so; the sort of strategic investment in farming and exports that the New Zealand government has made in recent decades.” Critics of the government’s decision to leave the EU single market and customs union said Trevelyan was involved in a damage limitation exercise that would fail to overcome the loss of tariff-free access to the world’s largest free trade zone. David Henig, a trade expert and director of the European Centre For International Political Economy, said the New Zealand deal was accompanied by an “exaggerated economic forecast” of the benefits to both countries and was “in reality likely to be economically marginal”. Trade between the two countries was worth £2.3bn in 2020. When the in-principle agreement was announced last year, New Zealand said it would provide a boost of almost £500m to its GDP. The deal is the latest step in Britain’s post-Brexit pivot away from Europe and towards countries in the Indo-Pacific region, where it sees export opportunities for professional services and luxury British goods. Trevelyan said the deal would eliminate all tariffs on UK exports to New Zealand and make it easier for British professionals and their families to work there. Coming on the heels of a deal with Australia, Britain said it was another step toward accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership – an 11-country trade pact central to British ambitions in the region. “Like all our new trade deals, it is part of a plan to build a network of trade alliances with the most dynamic parts of the world economy, so we set the UK on a path to future prosperity,” Trevelyan said.",News/Business,UK and New Zealand sign free trade deal,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/28/uk-and-new-zealand-sign-free-trade-deal
3/1/2022,"A54-year-old performed a dad dance in the Royal Box at Wembley and whipped half of the stadium into a frenzy by hoisting the League Cup aloft not once but three times. Jürgen Klopp’s appetite for the competition, and for winning, should not be questioned again. As is the case after any big club claims the first trophy of the season, the question turned quickly from Liverpool’s Carabao Cup success to its potential impact on other prizes that glitter on the horizon. Klopp’s players have been unequivocal with their answers. On social media Mohamed Salah posted: “One down ...” Trent Alexander-Arnold, who stated recently that one trophy a season should be the minimum expectation on a squad of Liverpool’s talent, had much the same outlook, writing: “1/4. Hungry for more.” Managers are often wary of hubris, Klopp included, but he admitted after the penalty shootout defeat of Chelsea that, with luck and continued hard work, Liverpool’s record ninth League Cup triumph could be “the start” for a season that retains possibilities in the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup. On current form, Manchester City’s six-point lead in the title race will not look insurmountable to a Liverpool team with a game in hand and a trip to the Etihad to come in April. They also hold a 2-0 lead over Internazionale in the last 16 of the Champions League and host the Premier League’s bottom club, Norwich, in the FA Cup fifth round on Wednesday. There will be a craving for another Wembley experience following a first domestic cup victory for a decade. Klopp’s options are plentiful should he opt for fresh legs in the FA Cup and to rest others ahead of West Ham’s visit in the Premier League on Saturday. Caoimhín Kelleher could start again and feel Anfield’s acclaim following his decisive contribution against Chelsea. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Takumi Minamino and Kostas Tsimikas did not make it off the bench in the final while Curtis Jones, impressive in the 6-0 rout of Leeds four days previously, did not make the matchday squad. The Liverpool manager attributed early League Cup exits in previous seasons to having to “just collect the bones and use the last of the few guys we have” following consultations with the club’s medical department. Now, with greater resources, he collects the trophy. Klopp was euphoric in his celebrations at Wembley and meticulous in his preparations. A goalless yet gripping final was decided by the finest margins and, once again, the Liverpool manager’s openness to fresh ideas and willingness to embrace specialists paid dividends. During an extended pre-season last summer Klopp invited a German neuroscience company called neuro11 to work with his players on their mental strength. Their studies concern “accuracy training”, which helps players focus on delivering set pieces. Liverpool have scored most set-piece goals in both the Premier League and Champions League this season and were flawless with 11 penalties in the shootout victory against Chelsea, their second-choice goalkeeper included. Dr Niklas Häusler and Patrick Hantschke, the founders of neuro11, spent last week at Liverpool’s training centre working with Klopp’s players again. The Liverpool manager credited the pair, who were present at Wembley, in an interview with the club’s TV channel after the Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga had spectacularly failed to unnerve any of his penalty takers. “Somehow I had a feeling we deserved it, Caoimhín especially deserved it, and you have to say that we have neuro11,” Klopp said. “We worked with them. In the pre-season, you should have seen the boys in the training camp. “They were training set pieces with the boys in the last few weeks and each player went through a proper drill, psychological, to do with penalties, corners and free-kicks. But penalties as well. So we had a list for the boys. First five and then six, seven, eight. But some of the players were not on the field any more. From eight onwards they were not even close on any list, so it was really exciting. Compliments to the boys, compliments to neuro11, they did an incredible job with the boys. I am really happy we could win it like this.” The penalty shootout victory on Sunday was more by design than chance. Klopp’s relentless pursuit of improvement and success sets an example that runs throughout Liverpool.",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp’s open-mindedness fuelling Liverpool’s silverware drive,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/28/jurgen-klopps-open-mindedness-fuelling-liverpools-silverware-drive
3/1/2022,"Dan Lawrence looks set to resume his Test career against West Indies in Antigua next week after being preferred to Ollie Pope in the rebooted England team that begins its solitary warm-up match on Tuesday. Lawrence, the Essex right-hander, went unused during the 4-0 Ashes defeat but will bat at No4, behind Joe Root, back at No3, in a 12-man side that takes on the Cricket West Indies President’s XI over four days at the Coolidge Cricket Ground. While Lawrence has played eight Tests to date, making three half-centuries but averaging 27, the batting line-up is also refreshed with the uncapped Alex Lees. The Durham left-hander opens alongside Zak Crawley at the ground built by convicted fraudster Allen Stanford and with no reserve, a debut in next Tuesday’s first Test awaits. Similarly a return for Surrey’s Ben Foakes behind the stumps has been locked in since the touring party for the three-match series was announced three weeks ago and the axing of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad drew the bulk of the headlines. In the absence of the record-breaking new-ball pairing five bowlers have been initially named in England’s warm-up attack – Chris Woakes, Mark Wood, Craig Overton, Ollie Robinson and Jack Leach – with a view to whittling this down to four next week. It means Saqib Mahmood, Matt Parkinson and Matt Fisher – all uncapped – must wait their turn. This one tour match, which is set to be streamed online, does not have first-class status, however, meaning England could yet experiment later in proceedings. The backing of Lawrence by Root and Paul Collingwood, the interim head coach, comes after Pope experienced a torrid time against Australia, averaging 11 from six innings. The Surrey right-hander did well to dodge a cull that saw fellow batters Rory Burns, Haseeb Hameed and Dawid Malan all dropped. Elsewhere, Jonny Bairstow returns from the thumb injury suffered while his scores of 113 and 41 in Sydney. The Yorkshireman is slated to bat at No6, while it remains to be seen whether Ben Stokes, down at No5, is fully fit to operate as a fourth seamer – something that would aid the selection of a spinner – after a side strain. England face a CWI President’s XI led by Shane Dowrich, the Barbados wicketkeeper who scored a century against them three years ago, and three more capped players in Raymon Reifer, Shermon Lewis, Shayne Moseley and Jeremy Solozano. Solozano’s solitary Test appearance to date came in Sri Lanka last November and was an unfortunate one, however, with the Trinidadian batter subbed out of his debut due to a concussion suffered while fielding at silly mid-off in the first innings. England v CWI President’s XI, Coolidge, Antigua, 1-4 March, 10am (local time) England (12): Zak Crawley, Alex Lees, Joe Root, Dan Lawrence, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Foakes, Chris Woakes, Craig Overton, Mark Wood, Ollie Robinson, Jack Leach.

3/1/2022,"Russia’s military offensive against Ukraine is an act of aggression that will make already worrisome tensions between Nato and Moscow even more dangerous. The west’s new cold war with Russia has turned hot. Vladimir Putin bears primary responsibility for this latest development, but Nato’s arrogant, tone‐​deaf policy toward Russia over the past quarter‐​century deserves a large share as well. Analysts committed to a US foreign policy of realism and restraint have warned for more than a quarter‐​century that continuing to expand the most powerful military alliance in history toward another major power would not end well. The war in Ukraine provides definitive confirmation that it did not. “It would be extraordinarily difficult to expand Nato eastward without that action’s being viewed by Russia as unfriendly. Even the most modest schemes would bring the alliance to the borders of the old Soviet Union. Some of the more ambitious versions would have the alliance virtually surround the Russian Federation itself.” I wrote those words in 1994, in my book Beyond Nato: Staying Out of Europe’s Wars, at a time when expansion proposals merely constituted occasional speculation in foreign policy seminars in New York and Washington. I added that expansion “would constitute a needless provocation of Russia”. What was not publicly known at the time was that Bill Clinton’s administration had already made the fateful decision the previous year to push for including some former Warsaw Pact countries in Nato. The administration would soon propose inviting Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to become members, and the US Senate approved adding those countries to the North Atlantic Treaty in 1998. It would be the first of several waves of membership expansion. Even that first stage provoked Russian opposition and anger. In her memoir, Madeleine Albright, Clinton’s secretary of state, concedes that “[Russian president Boris] Yeltsin and his countrymen were strongly opposed to enlargement, seeing it as a strategy for exploiting their vulnerability and moving Europe’s dividing line to the east, leaving them isolated.” Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary of state, similarly described the Russian attitude. “Many Russians see Nato as a vestige of the cold war, inherently directed against their country. They point out that they have disbanded the Warsaw Pact, their military alliance, and ask why the west should not do the same.” It was an excellent question, and neither the Clinton administration nor its successors provided even a remotely convincing answer. George Kennan, the intellectual father of America’s containment policy during the cold war, perceptively warned in a May 1998 New York Times interview about what the Senate’s ratification of Nato’s first round of expansion would set in motion. “I think it is the beginning of a new cold war,” Kennan stated. ”I think the Russians will gradually react quite adversely and it will affect their policies. I think it is a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was threatening anybody else.” He was right, but US and Nato leaders proceeded with new rounds of expansion, including the provocative step of adding the three Baltic republics. Those countries not only had been part of the Soviet Union, but they had also been part of Russia’s empire during the Czarist era. That wave of expansion now had Nato perched on the border of the Russian Federation. Moscow’s patience with Nato’s ever more intrusive behavior was wearing thin. The last reasonably friendly warning from Russia that the alliance needed to back off came in March 2007, when Putin addressed the annual Munich security conference. “Nato has put its frontline forces on our borders,” Putin complained. Nato expansion “represents a serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust. And we have the right to ask: against whom is this expansion intended? And what happened to the assurances our western partners made after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact?” In his memoir, Duty, Robert M Gates, who served as secretary of defense in the administrations of both George W Bush and Barack Obama, stated his belief that “the relationship with Russia had been badly mismanaged after [George HW] Bush left office in 1993”. Among other missteps, “US agreements with the Romanian and Bulgarian governments to rotate troops through bases in those countries was a needless provocation.” In an implicit rebuke to the younger Bush, Gates asserted that “trying to bring Georgia and Ukraine into Nato was truly overreaching”. That move, he contended, was a case of “recklessly ignoring what the Russians considered their own vital national interests”. The following year, the Kremlin demonstrated that its discontent with Nato’s continuing incursions into Russia’s security zone had moved beyond verbal objections. Moscow exploited a foolish provocation by Georgia’s pro‐​western government to launch a military offensive that brought Russian troops to the outskirts of the capital. Thereafter, Russia permanently detached two secessionist‐​minded Georgian regions and put them under effective Russian control. Western (especially US) leaders continued to blow through red warning light after a red warning light, however. The Obama administration’s shockingly arrogant meddling in Ukraine’s internal political affairs in 2013 and 2014 to help demonstrators overthrow Ukraine’s elected, pro‐​Russia president was the single most brazen provocation, and it caused tensions to spike. Moscow immediately responded by seizing and annexing Crimea, and a new cold war was underway with a vengeance. Events during the past few months constituted the last chance to avoid a hot war in eastern Europe. Putin demanded that Nato provide guarantees on several security issues. Specifically, the Kremlin wanted binding assurances that the alliance would reduce the scope of its growing military presence in eastern Europe and would never offer membership to Ukraine. He backed up those demands with a massive military buildup on Ukraine’s borders. The Biden administration’s response to Russia’s quest for meaningful western concessions and security guarantees was tepid and evasive. Putin then clearly decided to escalate matters. Washington’s attempt to make Ukraine a Nato political and military pawn (even absent the country’s formal membership in the alliance) may end up costing the Ukrainian people dearly. History will show that Washington’s treatment of Russia in the decades following the demise of the Soviet Union was a policy blunder of epic proportions. It was entirely predictable that Nato expansion would ultimately lead to a tragic, perhaps violent, breach of relations with Moscow. Perceptive analysts warned of the likely consequences, but those warnings went unheeded. We are now paying the price for the US foreign policy establishment’s myopia and arrogance. Ted Galen Carpenter is senior fellow for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute.

3/1/2022,"The time has come for a long overdue conversation about a menace with the potential for sweeping crisis, an urgent threat to the very fabric of American society: poop. Everybody does it, but we’d rather not think about it, and avoid discussing it unless we have to. Elisa Gambino’s new docuseries Wasteland (now streaming on Paramount Plus) informs us in no uncertain terms that we do have to, and isn’t hesitant about showing us why. “The philosophy for us was to try to present poop in a serious way, which is hard, because it’s so easy to slip into potty humor,” Gambino said over the phone during a stopover in Montana. “But we wanted to look at poop and how it affects environmental justice, to treat it with seriousness without being so serious that people can’t watch it. You try to find a middle ground.” Fecal matter represents a clear and present danger to that most precious human right of access to clean water, contaminating natural sources like streams and bubbling up into bathtubs and sinks due to faulty septic infrastructures. In choosing to shed fresh light on this vital, oft-ignored topic, Gambino faced an unsavory predicament. How much depiction is too much? Can something be too gross for TV? (There were times when she wasn’t sure she’d make it, developing headaches from the potent stenches along with her husband and director of photography Neal Broffman.) She didn’t want to shortchange just how abject some of this spillage and seepage could be, but at the same time, she understood that viewers have their limits. Like the rickety, untended pipes leaking bacteria into the water supply, people can only take so much shit before hitting a breaking point. “The episodes are quite beautiful,” she says. “They’re cinematic. We tried to create a feeling of all-is-well, where on the surface, flowers are blooming and corn is growing. But then there’s a theme of the underlying. Some people have said this looks too good to be about poop … The whole year I spent working on this, I divided my friends into two groups: the ones that would let me talk to them about the series and politely listen, and the ones who would just look at me and then change the subject, or walk away. I was happy on Thursday, when it premiered and I could say, ‘Look! I was really doing something! I wasn’t just talking about poop!’ Now, I don’t have to talk about poop so much. But I can’t flush the toilet or turn on the faucet without thinking about it.” For the resilient souls featured in Gambino’s series, excrement isn’t something to think about, but a terrible fact of daily life. Each of the four episodes concentrates on the hazards of contamination in a different state, as onscreen reporter and executive producer Adam Yamaguchi interviews the public works officials, activists and ordinary folks caught up in the vast impact of this ecological quagmire. In Alabama, Lowndes county falls within the predominantly African American Black Belt,and the specters of centuries-old racism still wreak secondhand havoc on the underserved population. Just outside New York City’s limits, the people of Mount Vernon share horror stories of brown geysers pumping their homes full of raw sewage. Down in the Everglades of Florida, septic tanks have caused lethal “algal blooms” that wipe out fish and other regional fauna while rendering water unsafe to drink. And in Iowa, the booming pig-farming industry generates more manure than anyone knows what to do with, and locals pay the price in cancer. Across each case, the constant is the insidious way that institutional neglect ripples out to create personal consequences. “I think sometimes too much responsibility is put on individuals, and we don’t think enough about the cause,” Gambino says. “In Alabama, people are responsible for their own septic system and they get absolutely no help. We’re always telling people to recycle their plastic at the cost of thinking about who’s making the plastic. People think it’s an individual choice to live in a house with a septic tank, but it’s not. This is everybody’s problem. We need to look at the legislation in Iowa that’s not serving the people. Infrastructure money needs to go to Mount Vernon and released to the people once received. It’s not just the collapsing pipes, it’s people doing things to make this job so much harder.” Without funding or the staff it would pay for, Mount Vernon Public Works Commissioner Damani Bush has no choice but to rush around town, plugging up each successive calamity like he’s jamming corks into one big sinking ship. Over and over, we’re shown how natural and human-made factors combine to leave our most vulnerable in jeopardy. One might sense a feeling of futility creeping on as they watch, as if the Earth has begun rejecting us and we’re powerless to stop it, but the truth is that there’s still plenty to be done. In Alabama, laws long since out-of-date hold the towns of Lowndes county down as much as any inevitabilities from the changing climate. The state has largely left the low-income community of mostly Black residents to fend for themselves in the fight for even the most basic creature comforts of modern life. “In the episode about Alabama, Dr Robinson talks about how following the civil rights movement, there was a lot of hope for people across the Black Belt that they’d find new prosperity,” Gambino says. “Every tool was used to make sure this didn’t happen. These systems that they rely on, the expensive systems of engineering – they’re left on their own to maintain them after they’ve been purchased. There isn’t even insurance available, where you can pay monthly and then be all right if your septic tank breaks. We have it for cars and homes, and this is sanitation, no less important. In Mount Vernon, people might look at an all-Black leadership and think that it can’t be an issue of racism, because look at local government. But the problems are so baked-in that they existed long before this change, divided by old racisms. I just want people to walk away with something to think about.” While Gambino has accepted that the oncoming deluge of sewage represents a problem too vast for any of us to take on, her film nonetheless leaves us with a call to action. All we can do is hold lawmakers’ feet to the flames in our demands to adjust the laws, as in Iowa, where something as simple as a stricter ordinance against spraying manure on frozen ground could make a planet of difference. “Legislators have concrete knowledge of what needs to be done to address these problems,” Gambino says, “but there’s no will among the legislators to do anything.” The structuring absence would seem to be the emergency conditions in Flint, Michigan, the most high-profile battleground in the fight for clean, non-contaminated water. But Gambino has observed a simplifying effect in how the public processes information that often places Flint at the forefront of this dialogue, as if we prefer to mentally constrain the sewage to a single location. The unfortunate truth, however, is that it’s everywhere. America is drowning in a vast sea of it, and we can’t afford to deny it any longer. If this feels like a stomach-turning thing to think about, just consider how much more visceral the response will be once it’s happening in your own home. “Not to take anything away from Flint, that’s so important right now, but the focus on it has sometimes kept us from looking at other places as well,” she says. “There are millions of people across the United States with non-potable water. It’s like Commissioner Bush says – this is a nationwide problem. We didn’t even get into the situations with the Navajo Nation, for instance, or West Virginia. It’s happening everywhere.” Wasteland is now available on Paramount+ with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Television & radio,‘This is everybody’s problem’: inside America’s growing sewage crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/28/wasteland-americas-growing-sewage-crisis-docuseries
3/1/2022,"What are the chances of humanity avoiding a full-scale disaster, given that history suggests civilisational collapse has been mostly the norm rather than the exception? The answer, according to the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, is that the odds of annihilation are lower than previously imagined. Scientists are clear that not enough is being done to head off a climate disaster. The IPCC suggests about 40% of the human race is living in the danger zone, and that many ecosystems are being irretrievably degraded. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, was forthright in describing the abdication of leadership by world powers as “criminal”. The world’s biggest polluters, he said, “are guilty of arson on our only home”. No amount of global heating is safe. If the world’s average temperatures rise by 1.5C – the goal of the Paris climate agreement – the IPCC report warns that up to 14% of species on land face a very high risk of extinction. At 3C, not an outlandish rise, almost a third of life on terra firma could be gone. This report is a final warning. The next time the world’s scientists pronounce will be at the end of the decade – when it will be too late to stop the rot. That is why it remains essential to stick to the UN targets of cutting global greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030 and achieving global net zero emissions by 2050. And why it is hugely disappointing that current commitments will see emissions increase by 14%. This risks a world in social chaos. Past inaction and the failure to begin significant emission reductions early have cost the world dearly. The idea of a gentle transition away from fossil fuels toward low-carbon alternatives no longer seems realistic. A catastrophic event such as the Arctic permafrost disappearing completely or the Amazon rainforest ending up a savanna could mean the world faces a climate disaster far sooner than the IPCC models predict. Greenhouse gases are not just carbon dioxide. Yet CO2 emissions might need to be reduced even further to compensate if climate-altering non-CO2 gases are not curbed quickly enough. The world must now take emergency action to rapidly reduce atmospheric carbon concentrations and take on the “arsonists” of the fossil fuel industry which refuse to manage their own decline. A speedy transition to a renewable energy future is required but is, unfortunately, not in sight. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is not about hydrocarbons, but has many implications for their use. Moscow has used its gas supply as a sword of Damocles over its major customers. The EU ought to reduce its reliance on gas as a matter of energy security and to stave off planetary destruction. The Ukraine crisis is showing that governments will spend vast sums of money to address a threat deemed serious enough. Germany reversed its ​​post-cold war foreign policy to spend €100bn on rearming its military forces in light of Russia’s actions. It’s a pity that a similar sum could not be found over a decade to help vulnerable nations deal with the climate crisis. African countries will spend, it is reckoned, an average of 4% of GDP on adapting to climate breakdown. What is needed is to find a way of living our lives that combines social justice with ecological sustainability. Depressingly, the IPCC reveals that the search has still not properly begun.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the IPCC report: inaction has cost the world dearly | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/28/the-guardian-view-on-the-ipcc-report-inaction-has-cost-the-world-dearly
3/1/2022,"Kremlin-backed television station RT could lose its licence to broadcast in the UK after media regulator Ofcom launched 15 separate investigations into its news coverage of the war in Ukraine. The English-language channel, once known as Russia Today and fronted by several British presenters and journalists, has repeatedly echoed President Putin’s narrative of the invasion. It has consistently referred to the invasion as a “special military operation” and focused on how Russia is supposedly protecting breakaway regions from Ukrainian aggression. British broadcasting rules allows politically biased coverage providing the output still meets the standards of ‘due impartiality’ – meaning viewers are still exposed to alternative viewpoints. The unprecedented scale of the investigation into RT, which relates to 15 editions of the channel’s hourly news headlines programme broadcast on Sunday, suggests Ofcom has grounds to believe RT has consistently failed to meet this standard in relation to coverage of the war in Ukraine. Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes said the investigations would be concluded urgently: “When reporting on an armed conflict, we recognise it can be difficult for broadcasters to verify information and events, but it is imperative that they make every effort to do so. They must also explain clearly to audiences where there is uncertainty or where events are disputed.” The decision follows the EU’s move to block Russian-backed media channels – including RT – over the weekend, although details of how that will be enforced remain unclear. The BBC fears its own operations and broadcasts in Russia could be severely restricted if Ofcom chooses to remove RT’s licence in the UK. Although Ofcom is operationally independent from the government, its leadership is appointed by ministers and it has come under substantial political pressure from both the Conservatives and Labour to investigate RT. On Sunday, prime minister Boris Johnson strongly criticised the channel: “The stuff that RT is peddling at the moment is doing a lot of damage to the truth, and I think it’s important that Ofcom should look at it and make up its mind about whether that organisation is infringing the rules of this country”. He said that while he might like to order it to be banned, “the difference between us and Russia is that the power is not with me, and that’s the right thing.” Ofcom very rarely removes licences from television broadcasters. When RT was found to have made multiple breaches of the broadcasting code over its coverage of the Salisbury poisoning and the Syrian war, it was fined £200,000 – although it has yet to pay up. RT’s online operation, which enjoys a substantial reach, would not be affected by any Ofcom ban. Only the television channel – which broadcasts on Freeview but has had historically low ratings – could be forced off air by the media regulator. On Friday, Ofcom executive Kevin Bakhurst told the Guardian that his regulator needed to respect free speech and would take into the account the potential impact on British outlets of any ban. He said: “We’d be mad not to think of the wider implications, not just for BBC journalists based in Russia but for Ukraine.”",News/World news,Ofcom opens 15 investigations into RT’s Ukraine war coverage,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/ofcom-opens-15-investigations-into-rts-ukraine-war-coverage
3/1/2022,"Speaking on Sunday at the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Family in London, Boris Johnson referenced the parable of the Good Samaritan, as he emphasised Britain’s solidarity with a people under vicious and sustained military assault. “We in the UK,” Mr Johnson told the congregation, “cannot shut our eyes and pass by on the other side.” But when it comes to playing its part in mitigating the plight of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees seeking sanctuary in the west, the government is abjectly failing to live up to Mr Johnson’s rhetoric. The ongoing refusal to abandon visa restrictions for Ukrainians, as one of the gravest refugee crises since the second world war unfolds on European soil, cannot stand. It is at odds with the moral urgency of the moment, and utterly at odds with the mood of the country: according to the latest YouGov poll, more than six out of 10 Britons support safe routes to resettle those fleeing the Russian invasion, including a majority of both Conservative and Labour voters. According to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), close to 400,000 Ukrainians have fled west, taking to the road in freezing temperatures. Most are women and children, forced to leave husbands and fathers behind to an uncertain fate. A large number will stay in central and eastern Europe: some will be able to lodge with relatives, others will be dependent on the kindness of strangers. But the UNHCR believes that 4.5 million desperate refugees could follow, if the war continues and intensifies. The whole continent must share and bear the weight of this humanitarian catastrophe, Britain included. Invoking for the first time legislation passed after Balkan wars of the 1990s, the EU is set to offer those fleeing Mr Putin’s forces the right to live and work in the EU for up to three years. They will not be required to apply for asylum. The home secretary, Priti Patel, by contrast, reiterated on Monday her intention to stick to visa requirements for all but immediate family members of Ukrainians resident in Britain. The immigration minister, Kevin Foster, refused to apologise for a tweet – later deleted – in which he alerted those outside this narrow group to the merits of the government’s seasonal worker scheme application process. In the context of a vast human exodus in the bitter cold, this risible contribution summed up what has too often been the cruel default mode of a government which thinks that compassion doesn’t pay politically. As the nationality and borders bill is debated in the House of Lords, representatives from Britain’s six major religions have called on Mr Johnson to abandon the plan to criminalise refugees arriving in Britain via irregular routes. The Ukraine crisis requires a leap of moral imagination from ministers that is adequate to the extraordinary moment. Interviewed on Monday, the Conservative chairman of the foreign affairs committee, Tom Tugendhat, predicted that the government would eventually shift to a European-style open-door policy on Ukrainian refugees. If that happens, as it should, proper resources need to be directed to councils and charities across the country to house and support those who arrive; this must be a national effort with proper leadership from Whitehall. The Good Samaritan did not simply talk the talk, as Mr Johnson is so often wont to do. He crossed the road to help the stricken stranger, and then paid for the man to be looked after.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on refugees from Ukraine: waive the restrictions | Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/28/the-guardian-view-on-welcoming-refugees-from-ukraine-britain-must-do-more
3/1/2022,"If the prospect of nuclear war wasn’t enough, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) picked this week to drop its latest report on the state of the climate crisis. The key findings are bleak, if familiar. Climate breakdown is accelerating rapidly; many of the impacts will be more severe than predicted. Nowhere will be spared. “The scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet,” said Hans-Otto Pörtner, a co-chair of the working group producing this report. These health impacts are physical – ​​increased chance of dengue fever, for example, or cardiovascular disease – but also mental: the suffering of living through storms, famine, heat stress, and the loss of homes and cultures. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, described the report as an “atlas of human suffering”, and it’s vital we remember that this suffering isn’t evenly distributed. In highly vulnerable countries, mortality from climate impacts is already 15 times higher than in some others. Despite being key to political questions of climate justice and climate financing more often than not, those most at risk are those who have the least historical responsibility for causing the problem. It’s clear that climate breakdown is not only here, it has been for a while. When the IPCC first started putting together these reports in the late 1980s, climate impacts were already being felt, but it still felt a bit far off, a problem for the future. Today, increasing numbers of people around the world have lived with the climate crisis their entire lives. It’s not just our now and tomorrow, but our yesterday too. Over the years the IPCC has been accused of pulling its punches, sticking to cold scientific language as a way to avoid overstepping into the realm of politics, which has been misconstrued as playing down the issue at hand. This push and pull between science and politics has haunted the IPCC ever since its inception. It’s the result of the partnership between two scientists – Bert Bolin and Mostafa Tolba – who were aiming to build on climate policy discussions that had rumbled on since the 1950s. They disagreed slightly on the role of scientists as advocates in such work. Tolba opened one of the first meetings with a powerful speech warning about future disasters if the world didn’t act promptly. The speech apparently worried Bolin slightly; scientists weren’t campaigners. If this was a problem in the past, the IPCC is clearly keen to present the world with a powerful warning now. The report is scientific, yes, with the numbers and notes on degrees of confidence you’d expect, but with a clear conclusion: we are living that nightmare-scenario future that scientists in the 20th century warned us about. “Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future,” said Pörtner. Not only are we on course for loss and suffering, many have lost and suffered a lot already, and some things are already gone for ever. As John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy for climate, put it: “The question at this point is not whether we can altogether avoid the crisis – it is whether we can avoid the worst consequences.” Emotionally speaking, it’s entirely appropriate to grieve for, as well as fear, climate impacts. We need to let ourselves feel that climate pain every now and again, but we can’t let ourselves be consumed by it. If we give in to doom completely, we only give in to the worst-case scenarios coming true. Plus, as the new report emphasises, every bit of a degree celsius matters – there is still so much we can save. I know climate campaigners always say this, but now really is the time for action. The best antidote to climate fear is always climate action, so roll up your sleeves and get to work. Not sure where to start? Do something that brings you joy. You’ll be at your most powerful and your most infectious. Climate change is grim, plain and simple. But taking action on it can be an absolute ball. You’ve got a range of options – you can work to help us quit fossil fuels, or shift what we eat and buy to get greenhouse gases down. We can call on governments to act faster to get us to net zero through moving to renewable energy and making our homes and transport more energy-efficient. We can plant trees and pursue other nature-based solutions. But we will also need to live with the changes that are already here. That means campaigning on a whole host of issues that might not immediately seem climate-related, too: migration, housing, poverty and mental health provision. The storms are here, and more are coming. We have to be ready for them.

3/1/2022,"Magdalena Timmins could not sleep on the second night of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. At home in Bradford, the 31-year-old received horrified texts from relatives in Poland. Her birthplace, the small border city of Przemyśl, had become the frontline of a growing humanitarian disaster as hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fled Vladimir Putin’s bombs. In a message to the Facebook group “Polish mums of Leeds”, Timmins appealed for donations to send to those in need 1,300 miles away. Within hours, her plea had spread across Yorkshire. By Monday, she had raised a multinational army of volunteers and received enough clothes, bedding and medical equipment to fill three 26-tonne lorries. “It’s overwhelming,” said Timmins, in a living room filled with mountains of boxes and bags destined for Poland. On one box, a child had written in Polish, beneath love hearts and a rainbow: jesteśmy z wami – “we are with you”. Members of Timmins’ Facebook group were on Monday spearheading the collection across Yorkshire: “Alicja and Jagoda in Leeds, Kamila in Wakefield, Joanna and Dorota in Doncaster, Anna in Bradford,” said Timmins, insisting that they are all credited in this article. Similar efforts have sprung up across the UK in response to the horror in Ukraine. The Yorkshire operation mobilised so quickly that they soon ran out of space. On Sunday a local farmer, Andrew Nicholls, 58, stepped in and offered three huge barns for storage and sorting. Nicholls’ family have owned the farm in Barwick, on the outskirts of Leeds, since 1935. On Monday it was filled with about 20 volunteers, including some who arrived in the UK only 15 years ago, as it became the centre of a huge collective effort between local communities. The first load of essential supplies, including camping beds, first aid kits and sleeping bags, is due to leave for the frontline on Tuesday. “It started as a Polish community thing, but it’s just spread. It’s overwhelming,” said Rachel Hall, a nurse at Leeds general infirmary, sorting donations she brought from the hospital. Hall, 46, said she had previously been involved in hospital charity appeals but “this is tenfold: it’s massive. I can’t go out and fight or be a nurse, but I can come here and do this.” Wrapping boxes of bedding, Roksana Pazdzione, 39, said she had got involved after seeing Timmins’ appeal to Polish mums. “It’s usually mum life, childcare, milk, job applications,” said Pazdzione, a nanny. Agne Rucinskaite, 42, said she had felt utterly helpless before she saw the Facebook appeal. Her parents in Lithuania had packed emergency supplies in case they are next to be invaded, she said: “If everyone would do a tiny bit [to help] the world would be a better place. My children are very proud because English is not my first language.” Timmins, who runs a freight business while looking after her two-year-old son, Ethan, broke down in tears while reading the messages written on donation boxes by local Polish children. If there was a silver lining to the catastrophe in Ukraine, she said, it may be that it has brought together communities from across Yorkshire: “Eastern Europeans are always perceived as the people that come to this country, steal the jobs, and we tend to get a bit of a bad press. “We were not very welcome when it all kicked off with Brexit, [but] everybody’s got together. We are a unit now. It’s brought solidarity throughout the whole eastern European communities and the British people living in the UK. We are not just people separately – we’re together at this moment of time.”",News/UK news,‘It started with Polish mums’: Yorkshire comes together to help Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/28/it-started-with-polish-mums-yorkshire-comes-together-to-help-ukraine
3/1/2022,"When, at the end of January, Poland’s deputy interior minister, Maciej Wąsik, said his country had “to be prepared for a wave of up to a million people” in the event of a major Russian invasion of Ukraine, many thought he was exaggerating. Just five days after the military attack ordered by Putin, over 280,000 Ukrainians have entered Poland. At this rate, Warsaw could be facing Europe’s largest wave of refugees since the second world war. The village of Medyka, in south-eastern Poland is the main border crossing with Ukraine. Thousands of refugees have crossed the border by bus, car and on foot. They are mostly women and children. After Kyiv decreed a full military mobilisation, Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are forbidden to leave the country. “I came here with my sisters, my mother and my grandmother,’’ Arina, 21, from Vinnitsya, told the Guardian. “My father stayed in Ukraine and we think about him all the time. It was a difficult journey to reach Poland and we don’t know what the future holds. But we are not alone. We are holdings hands with each other.’’ Arina says that until a few weeks ago, the possibility of finding herself in a war was as distant as in any other European country. Today, she and tens of thousands of fellow Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes, their loved ones, their cities and their country, which is at risk of belonging to someone else soon. “I left everything in Ukraine,” says Inna, 49, from Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city where Ukrainian forces have regained control after days of fighting . “My husband is fighting against the Russians. I have just arrived here, completely alone, with my three daughters. I do not know where to go.’’ More than half a million people have fled Ukraine in the last four days, Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, (UNHCR) said on Monday. On Sunday, over 45,000 people arrived in Poland in just 15 hours. According to the United Nations, up to five million people could flee abroad if the war continues, surpassing the 1.3 million asylum seekers from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Africa fleeing poverty and wars in 2015, which, by now, is Europe’s largest wave of refugees since the second world war. The mass exodus is causing severe queues at the Poland-Ukraine border, with rows of people and cars reaching 14 kilometers long and waiting times of 40 hours, according to UNHCR spokesperson, Chris Melzer. “I come from Lviv,” says Natalia, 33, who arrived in Poland this morning with her two daughters. “Generally, in normal times it would have taken me two hours by car to reach Poland, but it took me almost three days to get here.’’ According to some sources on the Ukrainian side of the border, the waiting times are caused by the processing procedure of Ukrainian authorities, who are determined to check every person who leaves the country. Women arriving on the Polish side of the border tell of children forced to stand waiting all day, in the cold, to cross the border with their families. Once on Polish territory, the Ukrainians are transferred to reception facilities, hostels, dormitories and sports facilities. Along with Ukrainian refugees, there are also groups of people from Pakistan, Ghana, Morocco and Somalia. Many of them are students, others are workers and still others are asylum seekers. Their fate is uncertain. It is unclear whether the Polish authorities will allow them to stay. Some would like to go back to their country. Others fear they will be sent back. “I arrived in Ukraine last December,” says Philippa, 24, from Ghana. “I had a great time there and I pray that my Ukrainian friends are fine. I don’t know what we’re going to do. They told us we can stay here for 15 days and then eventually renew our request to stay. But we still don’t know exactly what will happen in the end.’’ Rights groups have welcomed the efforts by Poland to help, but some drew comparisons with the treatment of other refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and Kurdish Iraqis in the country where its populist right-wing government has often played on anti-refugee sentiments. Last year, after the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, organised the movement of refugees with the promise of a safe passage to Europe and thousands of people from the Middle East were caught by Polish border guards in the forests near the border and illegally and violently pushed back to Belarus. Meanwhile, at the Przemysł train station, not all Ukrainians are heading west. At platform number four, trains arrive with Ukrainian refugees fleeing the country. At platform number five, dozens of Ukrainians are instead returning to the country to join the fighting. They are Ukrainians living in Poland. According to a spokesperson from the Polish border guard quoted by local media, more than 9,000 Ukrainian men have crossed back into Ukraine to join the army. “We can’t stand by and watch,’’ Sasha, 57, told the Guardian. “We are going back to Ukraine. To our home. We are going to fight.”",News/World news,‘I left everything:’ Tens of thousands of Ukrainians seek safety in neighbouring Poland ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/i-left-everything-tens-of-thousands-of-ukrainians-seek-safety-in-neighbouring-poland
3/1/2022,"Airbnb has said it will offer free, temporary housing for up to 100,000 refugees from Ukraine, joining a swathe of companies offering support and donations following the Russian invasion. The home rentals platform’s nonprofit set up to provide housing relief during international crises, Airbnb.org, will partner with resettlement agencies to house Ukrainian refugees across the world. The cost of the stays will be covered by Airbnb, donors to its refugee fund and hosts offering discounted or free accommodation. “We know that hosts on Airbnb and guests around the world will be eager to stand up and assist this massive effort and in the coming days, Airbnb plans to share details on how hosts on Airbnb and the broader community can support this initiative,” it said. Other companies are channelling their support by donating millions of pounds to charities helping those hit hardest by the Ukraine crisis. The jeweller Pandora has donated more than $1m (£746,000) to the UN’s children’s agency Unicef, while the shoe chain Kurt Geiger has given £50,000 to the British Red Cross, which is working with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society to provide food, water, medical supplies, clothes and shelter to those caught in the conflict. Neil Clifford, CEO of Kurt Geiger, said: “This is a situation of human suffering and we believe we have a moral obligation to reach out and help in any way we can. In light of this human crisis, we will be donating 100% of last week’s Kurt Geiger store profits.” Ukraine has received a surge in donations from companies and huge sums have flowed into the country in the last 24 hours. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is donating $10m to aid humanitarian efforts. It will also freeze the accounts of Russian clients targeted by sanctions, after Ukraine’s vice prime minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, called on major digital currency platforms to block crypto transactions among all Russian users. “We’re blocking accounts of those on the sanctions list (if they have Binance accounts) and ensuring that all sanctions are met in full,” a spokesperson for the company told Reuters on Monday, declining to give further details. Anonymous bitcoin donors have committed at least $13.7m to the Ukrainian war effort, according to cryptocurrency analysts, as an alternative to donations through traditional crowdfunding and payments companies – some of which ban payments to groups supporting the Ukrainian military. Elliptic, a blockchain analysis company, says the Ukrainian government, NGOs and volunteers have gathered the funds by advertising their bitcoin wallet addresses online. Gaming companies have joined the crowdfunding surge and the Polish developer 11 Bit Studios announced it would donate the profits made from its anti-war PC game, This War of Mine, in the next week to the Ukrainian Red Cross. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has forced nearly 400,000 people to flee their homes in Ukraine, according to the UN refugee agency. More than 4.5 million more could follow if the fighting spreads, Ukrainian authorities have said. The number of civilians killed has risen to at least 352, Ukraine’s interior ministry has said.",News/Technology,"Airbnb to offer free housing to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/28/airbnb-to-offer-free-housing-to-100000-ukrainian-refugees
