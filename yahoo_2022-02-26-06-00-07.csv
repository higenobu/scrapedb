2/26/2022,"By Arshad Mohammed and Jonathan Landay WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian and Ukrainian forces fought on Thursday for control of Chernobyl, the still radioactive site of the world's worst nuclear accident and a factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union. ""Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweeted before the defunct nuclear power plant, scene of a deadly fire and explosion in 1986, was captured by Russian forces. But why would anyone want an inoperative power plant surrounded by miles of radioactive land? The answer is geography: Chernobyl sits on the shortest route from Belarus to Kyiv, Ukrainian's capital, and so runs along a logical line of attack for the Russian forces invading Ukraine. In seizing Chernobyl, Western military analysts said Russia was simply using the fastest invasion route from Belarus, an ally of Moscow and a staging ground for Russian troops, to Kyiv. ""It was the quickest way from A to B,"" said James Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank. Jack Keane, a former chief of the U.S. Army staff, said Chernobyl ""doesn’t have any military significance"" but sits on the shortest route from Belarus to Kyiv, the target of a Russian ""decapitation"" strategy to oust the Ukrainian government. Keane called the route one of four ""axes"" Russian forces used to invade Ukraine, including a second vector from Belarus, an advance south into the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, and a push north out of Russian-controlled Crimea to the city of Kherson. The combined offensives amounted to the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two. Taking Chernobyl was part of the plan, and a senior Ukrainian official said it was captured on Thursday by Russian forces, though a senior U.S. defense official said the United States could not confirm this. The fourth reactor at Chernobyl, 67 miles (108 km) north of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, exploded in April 1986 during a botched safety test, sending clouds of radiation billowing across much of Europe and reaching the eastern United States. The radioactive strontium, caesium and plutonium mainly affected Ukraine and neighboring Belarus, as well as parts of Russia and Europe. Estimates for the numbers of direct and indirect deaths from the disaster vary from the low thousands to as many as 93,000 extra cancer deaths worldwide. Soviet authorities initially sought to cover up the disaster and did not immediately admit to the explosion, tarnishing the image of reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and his ""glasnost"" policies for greater openness in Soviet society. The catastrophe was widely seen as contributing to the collapse of the Soviet Union just a few years later. Acton said Russia's capture of Chernobyl on Thursday was not to protect it from further damage, saying Ukraine's four active nuclear power plants present a greater risk than Chernobyl, which sits within a vast ""exclusion zone"" roughly the size of Luxembourg. A make-shift cover, or ""sarcophagus,"" was built within six months of the disaster to cover the stricken reactor and protect the environment from radiation. In November 2016, a so-called ""New Safe Confinement"" was moved over the old sarcophagus. ""Obviously an accident within Chernobyl would be a big issue. But precisely because of the exclusion zone, it probably wouldn't impinge on Ukrainian civilians very much,"" Acton said. Ukraine's four operational nuclear power plants are running safely and there has been no ""destruction"" at the remaining waste and other facilities at Chernobyl, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Thursday, citing Ukraine's nuclear regulator. Acton said Ukraine's other reactors are not in exclusion zones and they contain nuclear fuel that is a lot more radioactive. ""The risks of fighting around them are significantly higher.""

2/26/2022,"Sunny Isles, Florida, is known as ""Little Moscow"" thanks to the many Russian elite who live there. They're worried sanctions could blacklist their money and prevent them from buying real estate. Experts say it's likely they won't be severly impacted. Sunny Isles, Florida, has long been an escape for Russia's wealthy and elite, who have purchased so much luxury property in the area that it's become known as ""Little Moscow"" or ""Moscow by the Sea."" ""They love to be here and they like to spend their money and enjoy their life,"" Russian realtor Lana Bell told News Nation correspondent Brian Entin on Monday. President Joe Biden issued sanctions this week that target Russia's elite and their families and restrict the Kremlin's ability to access Western financial institutions. Though people in Little Moscow have been worried the escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict will threaten their lifestyle and blacklist them from buying American real estate, Entin reported, Bell said it hasn't been a problem so far. Experts told the Miami Herald's Michael Wilner the sanctions currently in place are unlikely to have a strong affect in South Florida. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Thursday show the tensions are far from over. ""We are extending the reach of US sanctions to prevent the elites close to Putin from using their kids to hide assets, evade costs, and squander the resources of the Russian people,"" a National Security Council official told the Miami Herald. ""This is a new approach."" Anders Åslund, a Swedish economist and author of ""Russia's Crony Capitalism: The Path from Market Economy to Kleptocracy,"" doesn't think this will impact the Russian rich in the greater Miami region that Little Moscow resides in. He told Wilner that the Miami Russians aren't powerful enough to feel the sanction burn. ""These are comfortable people rather than the top people,"" he said. In Sunny Isles, condos can cost as much as $35 million. The most expensive home in the area currently listed on Sotheby's runs for $13.9 million. It's an area where the Trump brand is dominant, which The Washington Post reported was part of the appeal among Russian investors looking to move their money in the post-Soviet economy. Jose Lima, a salesman for the company that developed the region's Trump towers, told the Post in 2016 that Russian speakers bought about a third of the 500 units he sold. But Russian influence stretches beyond Sunny Isles. From Hollywood to Fisher Island, Russians have spent years snapping up properties along Florida's southeastern coast. Experts told Wilner that illicit financing has helped fuel the trend, although it's not all related to dirty money. They estimated that Russia's elite has more than $1 trillion in offshore accounts, which they said is disproportionally held in South Florida property. So far, Russia's richest billionaires have been impacted by the rising conflict the most. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the richest 22 of them lost $39 billion in one day. While many of the ""Little Moscow"" Russians didn't want to be identified when talking to News Nation's Entin, they did tell him off camera that they support Russian President Vladimir Putin.

2/26/2022,"As part of their invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces have used insignia of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to descend on several cities in the Luhansk region, Ukraine’s National Police warned Thursday. “Columns of Russian tanks entered the Luhansk region at the borders of Krasnaya Talovka, Milove, and Gorodishche. The enemy insidiously placed white vehicles with OSCE symbols at the front. Fighting is currently underway there,” police said in a statement. International monitors from the OSCE have been working along the frontline in Eastern Ukraine since 2014 to document fighting and ultimately help reduce tensions. The organization has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for an end to the war. We Have Failed Ukraine—and All Those Erased By Putin Similarly deceptive tactics by invading forces were reported elsewhere in the country. After Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the alarming news that Russian forces were trying to “seize” the Chernobyl nuclear plant, the site of the worst-ever nuclear disaster, residents in the area were quoted telling the UNIAN news agency that they had seen the troops make their way through by dressing up as peacekeepers. They reportedly made their way through in white trucks and armored vehicles that had “something like red flags” on the front. Elsewhere, in Sarny, Rivne, Mayor Ruslan Serpeninov issued a video address to residents, warning them that sabotage and reconnaissance units were entering the country from Belarus wearing Ukrainian military and police uniforms. He said the imposters were wearing red ribbons—a claim echoed by the National Police. The police service called on citizens nationwide to be on the lookout for “suspicious people on the streets,” particularly those with “elements of red.” They called on residents to call police immediately to report “suspicious people with elements of red on their clothes.” The disguises were part of a multi-faceted attack Russia launched against Ukraine at dawn Thursday, after denying for weeks that any invasion was in the works. More than a dozen Ukrainians were reported dead in the first few hours of the offensive, some of them civilians. Read more at The Daily Beast.
