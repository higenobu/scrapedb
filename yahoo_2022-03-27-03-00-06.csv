3/27/2022,"The Missouri father of the 14-year-old boy who died while on an amusement park ride in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday said his son knew he was in danger—and he wants to make sure no other child feels like that again. “He was panicking when he was going up,” Yarnell Sampson, the dad of Tyre Sampson, told WOFL. “He was explaining to his friend next to him, ‘I don’t know man. If I don’t make it down, please tell my Mom and Daddy I love them.’ For him to say something like that, he must have felt something.” Sampson’s description of his son’s fear matches what a woman told a 911 operator just after the tragic fall. In a 911 call obtained by the Daily Mail, a woman claimed Tyre had not been secured in his seat prior to the slip. “They didn’t secure the seatbelt on him,” she said. He was also breathing just after the fall, she said, but because he had fallen on his stomach, no one could perform CPR. His arms and legs appeared to be broken, she said. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office is investigating Tyre Sampson’s death after he fell from the 430-foot drop tower Thursday. Sampson retained Ben Crump, famous for his civil rights and personal injury claims, who said a fun time at a park “should not have ended in tragedy.” Sampson said the ride was the only one who offered to take his 6-foot-5-inch, 340-pound son, something he found suspicious. ""This one particular ride said, ‘We can take you, come on! Get on!’” he said. “No one else allowed him to get on the ride, so I’m wondering what happened between now and then that made them say, ‘Come on, get this ride!’” Sampson described his son as a star football player and honor roll student. Tyre, a St. Louis native, was in town with friends through his football program and had just come off a stellar season. He said his son had the NFL in sights for his future. “He was a team player. He was the type of young man that’d take the shirt off his back and give it to you,” Sampson said. Now he wants answers as to why that young team player with a bright future was killed. “This should never happen to anyone else’s child ever again,” Sampson said. “If I have anything to do with this, it will not happen ever again.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/27/2022,"A pair of British figure skating broadcasters have been suspended after a hot mic incident saw them describe a decorated Canadian skater turned coach and analyst in vulgar terms on Wednesday. Simon Reed and Nicky Slater, who were working on the International Skating Union's YouTube feed, appeared to believe their mics were off following the pairs skate at the World Figure Skating Championships in France. Here's how they discussed three-time Olympic medalist Meagan Duhamel in the ensuing conversation: Slater: ""We'll see if she liked it, if she tweets."" Reed: ""I don't worry about her."" Slater: ""We didn't mention her by name, we didn't mention her as one of the coaches."" Reed: ""The b**** from Canada."" [Both laugh] Duhamel, who is working the event for the CBC had been among a number of critics who weren't happy with Reed and Slater's commentary. She specifically took issue with their lamenting the lack of Russians at the event, due to their country's invasion of Ukraine, and their inability to identify the number of rotations on a jump, a skill expected of every serious skating commentator. Others criticized Reed and Slater for their descriptions of female skaters' bodies, misgendering a nonbinary skater and calling a 16-year-old skater ""a sight for sore eyes."" The next morning, the ISU tweeted a statement apologizing to Duhamel for its announcers' ""inappropriate and unacceptable behavior"" and announcing the pair have been suspended, effective immediately. The full statement: Following the Pairs Short Program at the ISU World Figure Skating Championships 2022, an open mic picked up a disrespectful comment made by the two commentators working on the international signal. The ISU is shocked by the language used by the two commentators which does not reflect its views whatsoever. The ISU strongly condemns any statements of a discriminatory or prejudicial nature. There is no place for harassing and abusive language or remarks and behavior in sport and our society. The ISU took instant action with its service provider to suspend both commentators with immediate effect and neither will cover any future Figure Skating events for the ISU. An internal investigation will follow shortly. The ISU offered its sincere apologies to Ms. Duhamel for the inappropriate and unacceptable behavior of the two commentators. Duhamel tweeted she has received personal apologies from both Reed and ISU president Jan Dijkema. Skating twitter, I hope we all enjoy some amazing skating today. I have received personal apologies from Simon Reed and the ISU president and I don’t think a public apology is necessary at this point. I appreciate and respect their apologies ❤️ — Meagan Duhamel (@mhjd_85) March 24, 2022",World/Yahoo Sports,Skating announcer removed from broadcast after calling ex-skater 'The b**** from Canada' on hot mic,https://news.yahoo.com/skating-simon-reed-nicky-slater-meagan-duhamel-canada-hot-mic-201222992.html
3/27/2022,"The girlfriend of Harmony Montgomery's father was found dead in New Hampshire, police said. Kelsey Small died on March 13 in Manchester, a police spokesperson said without releasing additional details. A cause of death is pending but it is not considered suspicious. Small was the girlfriend of Adam Montgomery, the father of the little girl police have been searching for since learning of her disappearance late last year. Harmony, 7, was last seen in 2019. Manchester police said the girl's disappearance is ""very concerning"" and that it is ""being thoroughly investigated."" Police are operating under the assumption that Harmony is alive. Small was not connected to the disappearance but did speak to police about Harmony in December. According to an affidavit, officers found Small and Adam Montgomery sleeping in their car in Manchester. Small told investigators that she had been in a relationship with Adam Montgomery for over a year, and said that he had not had any communication with his children. Small said that Adam Montgomery had never talked about Harmony and she did not know where the girl could be, the affidavit states.Adam Montgomery was arrested earlier this year along with Harmony's stepmother, Kayla Montgomery. Adam Montgomery was charged with felony second-degree assault, interference with custody and two misdemeanor counts of endangering the welfare of a child. The assault charge is from an incident in July 2019 when Adam Montgomery is alleged to have admitted to a concerned uncle that he gave Harmony a black eye after she failed to keep her little brother from crying, according to an affidavit. Kayla Montgomery was charged with welfare fraud after she was accused of collecting more than $1,500 in food stamp benefits for Harmony, even though the girl was no longer living at their home. They have both pleaded not guilty. According to investigators, Kayla Montgomery said that her husband told her in late 2019 that Harmony was returning to live with her mother. Adam Montgomery, who had legal custody at the time of the disappearance, allegedly told police that Harmony's mother, Crystal Sorey, picked up the girl to live with her. Sorey has not been accused of any wrongdoing. She previously said that she had been trying to track down her daughter since April 2019 and made calls to nearby schools and the New Hampshire Division of Children, Youth and Families. She told NBC Boston in January that she has been “begging for any type of answer” since she last spoke to her daughter nearly three years ago. “I don’t feel like she’s gone. I just don’t feel that in my heart,” Sorey said. “Like, I don’t feel like I lost her. And a mother knows, a mother knows if your baby’s here or not. I know she’s here.”",U.S./NBC News,Missing New Hampshire 7-year-old Harmony Montgomery's father's girlfriend found dead,https://news.yahoo.com/missing-hampshire-7-old-harmony-192200583.html
