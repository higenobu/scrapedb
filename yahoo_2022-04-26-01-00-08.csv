4/26/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — Ukraine's government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime Emperor Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday. Japan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia's invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said. The video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia's invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.” Japan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito, who was revered as a god until he renounced his divinity after Japan’s defeat. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided. He is known posthumously in Japan as Emperor Showa. “Portraying Hitler, Mussolini and Emperor Showa in the same context is completely inappropriate,” Isozaki told reporters. “It was extremely regrettable.” Isozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of the emperor's image, which Ukraine has done. “Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government tweeted Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.” Ukraine Ambassador to Japan Sergiy Korsunsky also apologized in a tweet Monday, saying the creator of the video lacked an understanding of history. Hirohito's son, former Emperor Akihito, devoted his reign to atoning for the impact of the war in and outside Japan. The video has been replaced with one without Hirohito's photo, but many Japanese on social media continued to criticize the original as an insult and said Japan should stop supporting Ukraine. Others said Hideki Tojo, the Japanese wartime prime minister who was later convicted of war crimes and hanged, would have been a better choice than Hirohito for the video. Some, however, raised concern that Japan’s demand that the video be revised was censorship and said Ukraine’s concession set a bad precedent that would embolden Japanese conservatives to further rewrite Japan’s wartime history. Japan has worried that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could have an impact in East Asia, where China's military has grown increasingly assertive and has threatened to unite with Chinese-claimed Taiwan by force if necessary. Japan has tried to play a greater role as part of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in response to the invasion, joining a series of sanctions against Moscow and providing support for Ukraine in line with other members. Japan provided $300 million for Ukraine and neighboring countries that have accepted displaced Ukrainians, and has also accepted hundreds of evacuees since Russia's invasion in late February.",World/Associated Press,Ukraine removes Hirohito from video after Japan protests,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-removes-hirohito-video-japan-102440028.html
4/26/2022,"Putin's military could be trying to hide the true Russian death toll in Ukraine, UK intelligence said on Monday. Russia proposed the military take over compensation payments for family from civilian officials. The Kremlin has refused to acknowledge a death toll in Ukraine, but admitted ""significant losses."" Russia's military could be trying to hide the death toll of its troops in Ukraine by proposing to take over compensation payments for family, UK intelligence said on Monday. Rather than civilian officials providing compensation payments for the families of dead Russian soldiers, Russia's defense ministry has proposed that the military oversee the service, UK's defense ministry wrote in a tweet. ""This likely reflects a desire to hide the true scale of Russia's losses from the domestic population,"" the UK said. Russia so far has refused to say exactly how many of its troops have been killed during the two-month war in Ukraine — it said in late March that 1,351 troops were killed and around 4,000 were wounded. But Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov acknowledged earlier this month that Russia has suffered ""significant losses"" on the battlefield, and added that it's ""a huge tragedy for us."" While the exact death toll is not known, there have been varying estimates: NATO says the death toll is likely closer to 15,000, and Ukraine says it has killed 20,000 Russian troops. Russia reportedly transported thousands of dead soldiers from Ukraine to Belarus, and Ukraine said there are thousands of unclaimed Russian corpses in its morgues. On the domestic front, Russian state-run media has painted its war in Ukraine as a success and there has been little reveal of any struggle that President Vladimir Putin's forces faced. Local newspapers in Russia were told to avoid reporting on soldiers' deaths, and families were ordered to keep silent. In an attempt to try and turn Russians against the war, Ukraine has used facial recognition software to send photos of dead Russian troops to their families.

4/26/2022,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — The Nicaraguan government said Sunday it is closing the Nicaragua offices of the Organization of the American States and expelling the staff. The announcement was the latest in a string of dozens of expulsions or jailings carried out by the government of President Daniel Ortega. In March, Nicaragua suffered the humilliating criticism of the country’s own ambassador to the OAS criticizing the arrests. Ortega was elected to a fourth consecutive term in Nov. 7 elections that were broadly criticized as a farce. Seven likely challengers to Ortega had been arrested and jailed in the months prior to the election. The OAS General Assembly voted to condemn the elections, saying they “were not free, fair or transparent, and lack democratic legitimacy.” In November, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Denis Moncada announced that the Central American nation would withdraw from the OAS, complaining of what he called its “repeated acts of meddling” in Nicaragua. On Sunday, Moncada accused the OAS of being a “diabolical instrument” of “intervention and domination” by the United States. “In the face of this truculent, calamitous and lying agency of the State Department of Yankee imperialism, we also announce that as of this day, we are leaving all the deceitful mechanisms of this monster, be they the permanent commission, commissions, meetings, and the Summit of the Americas,” the government said in a statement. In March, Nicaragua’s OAS ambassador, Arturo McFields, denounced his own government as a “dictatorship."" McFields asked for a point of order during an online meeting of the OAS to discuss unrelated topics and started speaking on behalf of “more than 177 political prisoners and more than 350 people that have lost their lives in my country since 2018.” “To denounce the dictatorship of my country is not easy but to keep silent and to defend what is indefensible is impossible,” said McFields, who until then had defended Ortega’s government when it was criticized by members of the OAS. Ortega’s government later issued a statement saying that McFields “does not represent us so none of his statements are valid.” On Thursday, the Nicaraguan government said that his appointment was “no longer in effect.”",World/Associated Press,"Nicaragua says it is closing OAS offices, expelling staff",https://news.yahoo.com/nicaragua-says-closing-oas-offices-005210611.html
4/26/2022,"Ovarian cancer is the most deadly of gynecologic tumors. Fewer than 40% of those diagnosed with ovarian cancer are cured, and approximately 12,810 people in the U.S. die from the disease every year. For the past 25 years, scientists have tried to identify a screening test to detect ovarian cancer in its earliest stages, when the chance of cure is high. Unfortunately, multiple clinical trials with hundreds of thousands of participants have failed to identify an effective way to screen for ovarian cancer. In fact, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gave ovarian cancer screening a grade of D in 2018, meaning it recommends against periodic screening because it doesn’t improve survival and can prove harmful to patients. Because no effective screening test currently exists, 70% of people with ovarian cancer are diagnosed at advanced stages, when chances of cure are poor. Around 60% to 90% of people with stage one or two cancer that stays around the ovaries and pelvis are disease-free five years after diagnosis, compared with only 10% to 40% of those with stage three or four cancer that has spread through the abdomen and beyond. But even those with advanced disease have a higher chance of being cured if complete surgical removal is still possible. This makes early diagnosis all the more important for overall survival. Without screening tests, many physicians wrongly assume that early diagnosis for ovarian cancer isn’t possible. As a gynecologic oncologist who treats hundreds of ovarian cancer patients each year, I was frustrated by these late diagnoses, and wondered if better recognition of its symptoms could help clinicians and patients identify ovarian cancer earlier. Ovarian cancer has historically been called a “silent killer,” because clinicians thought its symptoms were undetectable. Patients were often diagnosed so late that doctors thought nothing could be done. But there have been many studies over the past 20 years demonstrating that ovarian cancer does have early warning signs. My colleagues and I conducted one of the earliest studies in 2000. Our survey of 1,700 people with ovarian cancer found that 95% of patients reported noticeable symptoms three to 12 months before diagnosis. The most common symptoms were pain in their pelvis and abdomen, increased frequency and urge to urinate, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, and bloating or abdominal distension. Importantly, people with both advanced- and early-stage disease reported similar types of symptoms. Subsequent studies from multiple researchers further confirm that patients with even early-stage ovarian cancer experience frequent symptoms. We also found that providers often misdiagnosed ovarian cancer as another condition. When we asked patients what their doctors told them was the cause of their symptoms, 15% had their symptoms attributed to irritable bowel disease, 12% to stress, 9% to gastritis, 6% to constipation, 6% to depression and 4% to some other cause. Thirty percent were given treatment for a different condition. And 13% were told there was nothing wrong. One major issue has been distinguishing ovarian cancer symptoms from those of common gastrointestinal and urinary conditions. In another study, my team and I found that patients with ovarian cancer have symptoms with a recent onset and occur more than 50% of the month. To facilitate early detection of ovarian cancer, my team and I compared the symptoms ovarian cancer patients experienced with those of patients without ovarian cancer. We developed an index that identified six important symptoms of ovarian cancer: bloating, increased abdominal size, feeling full quickly, difficulty eating, pelvic pain and abdominal pain. Symptoms needed to occur more than 12 times a month but to have lasted for less than a year. Based on these criteria, our index was able to detect ovarian cancer in 60% to 85% of the patients in our study, a range similar to that achieved through diagnostic blood tests for ovarian cancer. While early detection is important, there are also prevention strategies that can help reduce the risk of developing ovarian cancer. If you have a family history of ovarian cancer, inform your doctor, who may recommend genetic testing to fully determine your risk, or prophylactic surgery to prevent the development of cancer. Oral contraceptives, tubal ligation (or surgery to close the fallopian tubes), pregnancy and breastfeeding all reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. Finally, up to 70% of ovarian cancers may arise from the fallopian tubes. Removing the fallopian tubes at the time of another surgery may be another option to help reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. This should be done only if you do not plan on becoming pregnant in the future. [Get fascinating science, health and technology news.

4/26/2022,"By Andrew Hay TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) -Wind-driven wildfires destroyed hundreds of structures in northern New Mexico and forced thousands to flee mountain villages as blazes burned unusually early in the year in the parched U.S. Southwest. Two wildfires merged northwest of Las Vegas, New Mexico, and raced through 15 miles of forest driven by winds over 75 mph (121 kph), destroying more than 200 buildings, state authorities said. To the northeast, a fire about 35 miles west of Taos doubled in size to become the largest burning in the United States, forcing the evacuation of a scout ranch and threatening several villages. The wildfires are the most severe of nearly two dozen in the U.S. Southwest and raised concerns the region was in for a brutal fire year as a decades-long drought combined with abundant dry vegetation. ""We have a longer, more dangerous and more dramatic fire season ahead of us,"" New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham told reporters, adding that the state had 20 active fires following Friday's ""unprecedented"" wind storm. The Calf Canyon and Hermits Peak fires near Las Vegas combined to burn 42,341 acres, an area larger than Florida's Disney World. Evacuations expanded to half a dozen more communities including the village of Mora, the governor said. Climate change has lowered winter snowpacks and allowed larger and more extreme fires to start earlier in the year, according to scientists. West of Taos, the Cooks Peak fire nearly doubled in size to 48,672 acres, forcing the evacuation of the Philmont Scout Ranch and threatening the village of Cimarron.
