5/12/2022,"It was well after midnight when the tawny owl began to call. With no wind, the sound seemed unreasonably loud and close at hand; it was probably perched in the large beech tree in the corner of the garden. Minutes passed before the first calls were returned by another, more distant, owl. I stepped outside, trying to locate the second participant, but could gain only the vaguest impression of direction and distance – placing this owl somewhere across the hill. With the moon below the horizon and a continuous covering of cloud, the darkness was profound – apart from a solitary light in the hamlet across the valley. After several minutes I could make out the outline of the trees and the distant profile of the hills where they stood out against the clouds. Morning brought a still, overcast sky which drained and flattened the colours of the landscape. The deeply shadowed lane below the beech wood is deserted and almost silent. A short stretch of the road hosts mature trees on both sides, the upper boughs crossing over like the vaulting of a gothic cathedral. From beneath this canopy of branches, the vivid – almost fluorescent – green of the spring leaves stands out against the grey blur of the sky. The vibrant colour is quick to fade, and the interval between brilliant emergence and full, sombre maturity is only a few days, but it forms a marker in the evolving season. The steep slope of the wood is covered with a mass of bluebells. These blooms are short-lived, becoming pinched and faded as they begin to pass their peak, but for now they are a welcome block of solid colour after the dour shades of winter. A scuffling sound in the hedgebank makes me look down – to discover a young rabbit, barely bigger than my hand, caught between the competing choices of curiosity and flight. Breaking my stride breaks the spell, and it heads off into the undergrowth. It will need to improve its reactions if it hopes to reach adulthood in a landscape rife with dangers.

5/12/2022,"The national students’ union has branded the prime minister a hypocrite for warning minimum wages cannot keep pace with inflation, while also requiring higher education loan repayments be indexed to consumer prices. Scott Morrison has said the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, is being “reckless” by supporting a 5% increase in the minimum wage, with the case to be decided by the Fair Work Commission within weeks. An increase of that scale was “like throwing fuel on the fire of rising interest rates and rising costs of living”, the PM said during a visit to the Hunter region on Wednesday. However, Georgie Beatty, the president of the National Union of Students, said it was “just plain hypocrisy” to demand wage increases be less than the headline inflation rate when the government pegs its own student loans under the higher education contribution scheme (Hecs) to the CPI. “Students are really feeling the brunt” of higher prices, as the cost of rents, food and other costs increase, Beatty said. Many students, meanwhile, would be holding down jobs such as in retailing and hospitality that were paid at the minimum wage of $20.33 an hour, as set by the commission this time last year in its annual reset. Beatty, who was speaking after the first of two days of strike action by staff at the University of Sydney over poor pay and conditions, said student debt itself was ballooning even before the higher CPI-linked repayments kicked in. “It’s not just that our fees are based on a much higher rate of inflation than our wages,” she said. “It’s that Scott Morrison’s ‘job-ready graduates’ fees meant we also saw unprecedented fee hikes, with arts degrees going up by 113%.” “Students are questioning how we are going to pay off these increased fees when we are facing increased cost of living, insecure work and we haven’t seen major wage growth in most of our lifetimes,” Beatty said.

The CPI-base for student loans is written into the act setting up Hecs. According to the Reserve Bank, the CPI should peak at almost 6% by the end of 2022, up from a 5.1% annual pace in the March quarter. That latter reading was the most in 13 years. The Greens, who are campaigning to “wipe student debt”, said the discrepancy between how student debt and wage rises were treated demonstrated the government’s priorities.“If student debt can be automatically lifted with inflation then wages can too,” the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said. “The Greens want to change the law to lift the minimum wage to 60% of the median wage and to guarantee wages in female-dominated industries rise at least 0.5% faster than CPI to close the gender pay gap.” Data from the OECD shows the minimum wage as a proportion of median pay packets has been on a long-term decline since at least 2000. The average for OECD members has increased over that time. “It’s disappointing Labor won’t make a submission to the Fair Work Commission to require a lift to the minimum wage, something the Greens have done and will push for in the next parliament,” Bandt said. “We need a full-court press on lifting wages now.”",News/Australia news,Morrison stance on minimum wages branded ‘hypocrisy’ as student loans remain indexed at inflation rate,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/morrison-stance-on-minimum-wages-branded-hypocrisy-as-student-loans-remain-indexed-above-inflation
5/12/2022,"The New South Wales Liberal treasurer Matt Kean has warned of the dangers of a Trump-like shift to the right within the conservative party, as he pleaded with voters not to boot out moderate MPs in favour of teal independents on 21 May. The plea was supported by the state’s premier, Dominic Perrottet, who said voters would regret stepping away from the party if independents won seats over moderate Liberals. Speaking alongside the Wentworth MP Dave Sharma, Kean warned that unseating moderate Liberals would leave the party lacking important perspectives, drawing parallels to the Republican party in the US. “We’ve seen the impact of what happens when the centre-right parties lose moderate voices,” Kean said. “Look at the Republican party. The party of Lincoln, the party that has abolished slavery, has now become the party of Trump, the party of Putin sympathisers and anti-vaxxers. “That’s not in the Liberal party’s interest and that’s why we need strong voices like [federal NSW MPs] Dave Sharma, Trent Zimmerman and Jason Falinski in the Liberal party room to make sure the Liberal party remains reflective of the communities that we’re hoping to serve.” He said it was important to keep moderates including Sharma around “if the Liberal party is going to continue to be a modern party”. Sharma is facing a serious challenge from high-profile independent Allegra Spender, who has been campaigning strongly on climate and integrity issues. She is one of a handful of “teal” candidates hoping to unseat inner-city Liberals across the country, including the federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg in his Melbourne seat of Kooyong. Spender has been contacted for comment. Perrottet, from the conservative side of the Liberal party, reiterated Kean’s pitch that diverse perspectives were important and urged party members to stick with them. “Those local communities will be better served having those members in parliament rather than independents. Independents … talk a lot, but they deliver very little,” he said. “The party is best served whilst maintaining its broad church. It was John Howard’s success as prime minister for many, many years. “People should not be turned away from the Liberal party because someone shares a different opinion. Our party’s at its best when you respect different ideas.” Perrottet said he was concerned people walked away rather than engaged in debate when they disagreed, warning he had seen people “regret it” in the past. “The best way to improve our party is to be part of it.” When asked if the controversial Warringah Liberal candidate Katherine Deves would enrich the party’s broad church if she were elected, Perrottet reiterated he did not agree with “the way she’s expressed her views”. Deves apologised last month after a deluge of social media posts discussing the rights of transgender women and girls to participate in sport were uncovered, including claims that “half of all males with trans identities are sex offenders”.",News/Australia news,Matt Kean warns of Trump-like shift in Liberal party if teal independents oust moderates,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/matt-kean-warns-of-trump-like-shift-in-liberal-party-if-teal-independents-oust-moderates
