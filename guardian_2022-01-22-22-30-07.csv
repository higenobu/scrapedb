1/22/2022,"The sequel to 2016’s animated jukebox musical Sing hits UK screens this week, with Scarlett Johansson, Matthew McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon again lending their voices to anthropomorphic animals who like to, well, sing. U2 feature with Your Song Saved My Life, the sort of textbook mid-tempo-ballad-for-a-movie that chalks up an Oscar nomination without touching the sides.  Last year Bono and the Edge joined Dutch DJ Martin Garrix for the Euro 2020 (2021) anthem We Are the People, the sort of uptempo-ballad-for-a-football-tournament that is played at the opening ceremony and never heard again. Somewhat confusingly, the song’s video featured former Irish international Jason McAteer recreating a 2001 goal he scored for Ireland in an entirely different football competition, but that’s a rabbit hole all of its own. Few will forget the last Euros: England made the final, a fan stuck a flare in his backside, and Italy won the whole thing. In the quarter-finals, Roberto Mancini’s team dispatched much-fancied Belgium, with a stunning strike from Lorenzo Insigne getting them over the line. Insigne is the current captain of Serie A side Napoli: an honour once held by Diego Maradona. The 1984 arrival of the world’s greatest footballer in Naples provides the backdrop of Paolo Sorrentino’s recent “extravagantly personal movie” The Hand of God (Netflix). This Must Be the Place, Sorrentino’s so-so English language debut from 2011, featured the first major role for Irish actor Eve Hewson, more recently seen in the Netflix series Behind Her Eyes and the BBC’s The Luminaries. Hewson is the daughter of Bono who, as well as providing a song, lends his vocal talents as a reclusive rock star lion in English writer/director Garth Jennings’s … Sing 2. Watch Before Jennings bestrode Hollywood, he was one half of director/producer team Hammer & Tongs, makers of ingenious music videos, including the odyssey of a milk carton for Blur’s Coffee & TV. Eat In Sorrentino’s Oscar-winning 2013 opus The Great Beauty, Jep, the writer-protagonist, has a working lunch of what looks like a tomato-based risotto. On sampling it, Jep wisely intones, “Reheated rice is always tastier than freshly cooked rice. The old is better than the new.”",Arts/Culture,What links Scarlett Johansson to the football fan with the flare up his bum?,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/22/what-links-scarlett-johansson-to-the-football-fan-with-the-flare-up-his-bum
1/22/2022,"One of Tamara Rojo’s early acts as artistic director of English National Ballet was to mount a production of the 19th-century classic Le Corsaire. Now, as she is about to head off to the new pastures of San Francisco Ballet, her final gift to the company she has led with such dazzling daring for a decade is her own new production of Raymonda. Rojo loves these 19th-century warhorses, the legacy left by Marius Petipa that set the template for classical ballet. She thinks they make dancers dance better (which they undoubtedly do) and that they represent a history that must be reinvigorated but preserved. That, I think, is more debatable.  The reason that Raymonda, first seen in 1898, has fallen out of the repertory of every British dance company – though the Russians and the French continue to dance it without much worry – is a plot (invented by society author Lydia Pashkova) that was always idiotic and is now unacceptable. Set at the time of the Crusades, it features a bland, posh-girl heroine who loves the noble warrior Jean de Brienne but is pursued by an evil Saracen. Rojo, helped by dramaturg Lucinda Coxon, has moved the action to the Crimean war. Raymonda (Shiori Kase) now leaves her family to find fulfilment as a Florence Nightingale-style nurse, and in the process finds herself torn between her feelings for her dull fiance, John de Bryan (Isaac Hernández), and his glamorous Ottoman ally Abdur Rahman (Jeffrey Cirio). Rojo preserves a lot of Petipa’s choreography, though not always in the same places, while providing linking passages herself. It’s clever, and at times it works. Antony McDonald provides sumptuously smart designs with a photographic theme, with frames enclosing the action and a ramp at the back of the stage down which, in a dream sequence, wounded soldiers process in agony, like an echo of the shades in La Bayadère. The costumes, all tartan cottons, swishing silks and pink candytuft, are brightly evocative. But transposing the choreography to a different storyline keeps some of the same problems. All the time you can feel the fierce force of Rojo’s intelligence pushing against steps that are stunning in themselves but not expressive of meaning. At too many moments the action stops so the participants can get on with some pretty dancing. The plot literally gets pushed to the sides of the stage, where soldiers suffer and Rahman makes his case to be the love of Raymonda’s life. Cirio makes him sexily compelling, but he doesn’t have enough to do. As John, Hernández scissors around the stage effectively, his charm making the most of a thankless role. Precious Adams shines as a saintly Mary Seacole figure. But though she is wonderfully fluid in her movements, Kase’s calm, delicate presence can’t provide the drama the choreography lacks; Raymonda’s decision to pursue her career rather than either man feels rushed. The chief success of the evening is ENB’s commitment to making it work. The entire company dances with passion and precision, and Glazunov’s score, often regarded as the main triumph of the ballet, is given its full worth by the orchestra under the direction of Gavin Sutherland. Rojo is leaving her company in fine, brave shape. Raymonda is at the Coliseum, London, until 23 January.

1/22/2022,"Long queues of lorries built up on approach roads to Dover this week because of a spike in freight traffic and not because of Brexit, the Port has said. However, drivers on the road expressed fury over the delays, describing the situation as “absolute carnage” and blaming a mixture of delays in Brexit checks and Covid paperwork.  Highways England confirmed that high volumes of traffic had led to queues but with Brexit checks in place for more than a year, drivers were baffled as to why this week had been so bad. The increase in freight traffic meant that the Operation Travel Access Protocol (TAP), a temporary traffic management system, which was devised for heavy traffic times in 2015, was put in place on Wednesday and Thursday leading to tailbacks on the A20. Operational reports show that it was in place from 4am to 10pm on Wednesday. It was also in place for long periods on Thursday between 8am and 11.30am and 1pm to 7pm, as traffic built up again. Operation TAP has been used on 10 of the past 21 days. “A20 Dover TAP has indeed been in place for short periods of time this week. TAP is a well established and regularly used normal operational tool to help manage traffic flows into the Port of Dover at busy times and it has been for a number of years. This was the case yesterday as it has been similarly over the past few days,” said a spokesperson for the Port of Dover. Freight traffic usually surges in the third week of January after the Christmas break but drivers said the delays this week caught many by surprise. One driver, Ciaran Donovan, who has been posting about Brexit checks for the past three years, said it was taking “10-20m per vehicle to process paperwork”, adding sarcastically it had “absolutely nothing to do with Brexit apart from the fact Covid has nothing to do with it”. Correct, and 30km queues in Calais. I am a Dover customs account manager and it is absolute carnage. The sheer volume of red tape is baffling and the confusion grows everyday due to contradictory guidance from https://t.co/6vzPat6tm9 and PortHealth. But we are doing our best! Queues appeared to have eased on Saturday, with one website that tracks driver experiences on the road claiming the queue stretched back just more than one mile. Earlier this week the Port of Dover said it was concerned queues could get much worse in September, when airport-style biometric checks are due to be implemented. Doug Bannister, the chief executive of the port, is looking for urgent meetings with the government amid fears the checks will add delays and cause danger. “As currently designed, the biometric checks work well at an airport or a rail terminal, but they’re not designed for a busy roll-on, roll-off ferry terminal. “If it is forcing people to get out of their vehicles inside of a busy port, that is just unsafe. We couldn’t allow that to happen. That will lead to increased queues, no doubt,” he told the BBC. Earlier this week the House of Commons transport select committee visited Dover as part of a fact-finding mission ahead of the introduction of the checks in September. The committee chair, Huw Merriman, said it was important that the British and French worked together to find a solution, adding: “We have to rely on the French to assist us here as well. It causes as much damage over in Calais as it will here in the Port Dover.”",News/World news,Dover blames queues on spike in freight traffic not Brexit,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/dover-blames-queues-on-spike-in-freight-traffic-not-brexit
