5/18/2022,"The Coalition, Labor and the Greens (plus the wave of independents) are getting most of the headlines in this election. But your ballot papers will also be full of candidates representing parties you might not know much – or anything – about. From the big-spender ads of the United Australia party and the re-election desires of One Nation, to a bunch of micro-parties representing niche interests, Australia’s democracy and elections are a rich tapestry – and it takes all types to make a campaign. Here’s a quick rundown of these lesser-known parties running Senate candidates in the 2022 Australian federal election on 21 May, and what they stand for. With representatives in NSW and Victoria’s state parliaments, the party says it wants “to give a political voice to animals”, including promoting animal protection and “animal-friendly policies”. They campaign for increased penalties for animal abuse, animal trade, and supporting sustainable and ethical practices. Running in: the Senate in all states besides Northern Territory, as well as lower house seats in most states. Led by the former special forces soldier Heston Russell, the party says it aims to “bring balance into the Centre” of politics. AVP wants to create an American-style National Guard to assist in emergencies, better support for defence veterans, a review into ABC funding, “greater certification requirements for media organisations and journalists to be permitted their special exemptions under legal legislation”, and “greater consequences” for “negligent” media reporting. Running in: the Senate in Queensland, NSW, WA and Victoria, and several lower house seats in Victoria and Queensland. The party wants to elect “a Christian voice amidst the voices in Parliament”. It wants to see marriage as only between a man and woman, “zero tolerance” to drugs, and suggests an inquiry into increasing the legal drinking age to 21. It also says the settled scientific view that carbon dioxide is contributing to climate change needs “further scrutiny”, opposes euthanasia, and wants to restrict IVF to married couples. Running in: the Senate, as well as nine lower house seats, in WA only. Saying they were “inspired by the policies of old Labor”, the party wants to start a public bank at post offices, repeal the prohibition on nuclear power, wants a “dramatic” increase to health resourcing and a moratorium on house and farm foreclosures. Running in: the Senate in Queensland, Victoria, SA, WA and NSW. Once a major player in the Senate, the party’s presence has faded significantly since it was formed by the former Liberal politician Don Chipp. In the small-l liberal tradition, it pursues broadly centrist economic policies, social liberalism and puts an emphasis on political accountability. Running in: the Senate in SA, NSW, Victoria, WA and QLD. Named after its leader, the former journalist, the Justice Party is calling for reforms to bail, parole, family courts and domestic violence law, campaigning for sentencing to “reflect community views” and “more jail, less bail”. Running in: the Senate and several lower house seats in Victoria Named for the anti-Communist party activist, the party wants to “stand up to China”, support Hong Kong, Uyghur and Tibetan communities and repeal Australia’s free trade agreement with China. The party also is calling for welfare rates to be raised above the poverty line, and wants to boost renewables and put dental health into Medicare. Running in: NSW, SA and Queensland. The name pretty much sums it up. As the party says, it is “a single-issue party and that issue is anti-corruption”. It wants a national Icac, to limit donations to political parties, real-time disclosure of donations, and to restrict politicians from being appointed to government positions or commercial businesses connected to their former portfolios. Running in: the Senate in NSW, Queensland and WA. The party backs Christian values, opposes late-term abortions and the teaching of “gender fluidity” in schools, and wants to consider “corporal punishment models” to penalise rape and other serious crimes. Running in: the Senate and lower house seats in Victoria, WA, SA, Queensland and NSW. A “fusion” of the Science, Pirate, Secular, Vote Planet and Climate Change Justice parties. Its policies include a 10-year transition to negative emissions, a carbon price, 800% renewables, high speed rail, and a $500 weekly universal basic income. Running in: NSW, Queensland, SA, Victoria and WA in the House and Senate Led by the controversial former One Nation senator Rod Culleton. GAP backs “mandatory” jail for violent crimes and boot camps for juvenile offenders, would relax firearm laws, has policies for a “concealed carry licence”, and would abolish income tax and remove compulsory superannuation. Running in: the lower house and Senate in WA, Queensland, NSW, Victoria, SA, NT. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The party is calling for the protection of rivers and better water management, an end to detention for Indigenous children and ending adult incarceration “except for the most serious offences”, and replacing fines with community service. Running in: NSW and Queensland. Imop campaigns for people’s right to refuse or choose medical products and procedures like Covid vaccines, including advocating the removal of No Jab No Play and vaccine mandates. It also wants to remove fluoride from drinking water, promote alternative therapies, legalise medical cannabis nationwide and pause the rollout of 5G technology. Running in: ACT, NSW, Queensland, SA, Tasmania, Victoria and WA. The Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie wants to get more supporters in parliament. She wants to lower donation caps and introduce real-time disclosure, boost local manufacturing and start an inquiry into Chinese foreign interference. Running in: Tasmania Bob Katter’s organisation wants to lower power prices, relax firearms and crocodile culling laws, have an opt-out scheme for organ donation, increase access to vaping products and boost north Queensland infrastructure such as roads and rail. Running in: Queensland With some financial support from Climate 200, law academic Kim Rubenstein is campaigning on climate, integrity and a federal Icac, women’s safety and a First Nations voice to parliament. Running in: you guessed it, the ACT Unsurprisingly, the party wants to legalise, tax and regulate weed. It wants a moratorium on arresting users and to expunge historical sentences for personal use, as well as to allow people to grow cannabis at home. Running in: all states and territories. Still running under their original name (despite a high court challenge), the libertarian party’s run is being headlined by the former Liberals Campbell Newman and John Ruddick. Calling for smaller government and low taxes, the Liberal Democrats want to institute American-style “recall elections”, wind back Covid and mask rules, immediately cut all government departments and politicians’ pay by 10%, and a flat tax of 20% for all. Running in: all states and territories. Focusing on candidates who are “independent local leaders who are already contributing to their neighbourhoods”, this party has a larger focus on Tasmania-specific issues such as salmon farming, the state’s energy mix, and further restrictions on poker machines. It also advocates for “citizens’ juries”, or the process of deliberative democracy, to decide contentious issues. Running in: Tasmania and SA. Formerly known as the New Liberals, TNL advocates for net zero emissions by 2030, a retrospective federal Icac, a legislated charter of rights, boosting foreign aid, new lyrics for the national anthem, restricting mass political advertising, real-time political donation disclosure, and restricting politicians to serving only 12 years in parliament. Running in: Queensland, NSW, Victoria and SA. Looking to hold Pauline Hanson’s Senate seat in Queensland, One Nation wants to remove Australia from the United Nations Refugee Convention and Paris climate agreement, boost government subsidies to apprentices, block sale of property to non-citizens, and place further restrictions on abortion. Running in: all states and territories. The fledgling party says it aims to end poverty, homelessness and the climate emergency, and dismantle corruption. It wants an emissions trading scheme and a federal Icac. Running in: Victoria, ACT, Queensland, SA A centrist party, Reason seeks to decriminalise all drugs and legalise cannabis, promotes comprehensive sex education in schools and supports more progressive policies on Indigenous Australians, women, the LGBTIQ community and immigration. Running in: Victoria, NSW, Queensland. Led by the sitting senator and former Centre Alliance member, Patrick is campaigning on greater transparency and accountability in government and addressing foreign interference. He also has numerous South Australia-specific policies such as boosting manufacturing jobs and the submarine industry, as well as protecting the Murray-Darling. Running in: SA They want greater scrutiny on foreign land purchases, the expansion of the live export trade, reduced restrictions on “law-abiding firearms owners”, to implement a bill of rights and to expand private game reserves and hunting areas. Running in: NSW Pushing for policies to benefit retirees and pensioners, the party wants reforms for dementia and palliative care, simpler rules around aged care and a public TV channel for seniors. They also want more staff and money for aged care, expansion of the veteran’s “gold card” and more support for army veterans. Running in: NSW and WA Promoting “revolutionary change”, the party is campaigning for equality and against gas mining. They want to repeal the GST and the stage 3 tax cuts, raise company tax and a new “wealth” tax, nationalise mines and banks, go to 100% renewables within 10 years, more progressive policies on refugees and asylum seekers, and to abolish Asio and other spy agencies. Running in: NSW, Queensland, Victoria and WA The party is campaigning to stop overdevelopment and corruption and to protect the environment. SAP wants free university for all, a ban on all new coal mines and fracking, a ban on further foreign ownership, a national job guarantee program for full employment and a universal age pension. Running in: all states and territories. Clive Palmer’s pet project is blanketing the country with ads about low interest rates, abolishing Hecs debts and ending a range of anti-Covid measures such as masks and vaccine mandates. United Australia Party (UAP) also want to increase the age pension, enact more generous rules for mining and freeze fuel excises. Running in: all states and territories Running on a similar “revolutionary” platform to the national Socialist Alliance – including scrapping the GST and increasing taxation on the rich and corporations, lifting welfare payments to at least $1,500 a fortnight and nationalising the banks – the party also calls for governments to pursue a long-term Covid elimination strategy. Running in: Victoria A “centre-based” party, it spruiks policies focused on WA, including basing more federal government workers and public spending in the state. It also wants to abolish political donations from property developers, reform stamp duty and property taxes, and direct more mining royalties to regional WA.

5/18/2022,"Nationals frontbencher David Littleproud has claimed that spending cuts imposed across the public sector to deliver $3.3bn in savings to pay for the Morrison government’s election commitments will not result in job losses. Littleproud at first told the ABC erroneously on Wednesday morning that “governments don’t employ people, businesses do”. The ABC Breakfast host Michael Rowland then pointed out to the minister that governments do employ many thousands of people “called public servants”. Rowland then asked Littleproud whether or not the new efficiency dividend the Morrison government outlined on Tuesday would result in thousands of job losses for public servants. Littleproud replied: “No, because this is an efficiency dividend that even a business looks at”. “The public service shouldn’t be exempt from running the ruler over about how they’re spending money … that’s what businesses do,” he said. “That’s what the Australian public service should do”. Littleproud characterised arguments to the contrary as “scaremongering”. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and the finance minister, Simon Birmingham, released the Coalition’s election costings in Melbourne on Tuesday, and said an increase to the public sector efficiency dividend and changes to super contributions would offset the $2.3bn in new spending promises made by the Coalition since the beginning of the campaign. Unions say the new cut will result in thousands of public servants losing their jobs. Littleproud contended ongoing cuts were necessary: “The public service has got to make sure there’s no fat in the system, there isn’t anything that is being wasted, and that’s only sensible management that a normal business would do and I think the Australian taxpayer would expect us to do that in a sensible way.” But the proposed cuts will not help the Liberal party in Canberra. For the past 50 years, the two ACT Senate spots have been held by the Labor and Liberal parties, but in 2022, two high-profile progressive independents, David Pocock, a former rugby union star player, and constitutional law professor Kim Rubenstein are vying to replace the Liberal incumbent, Zed Seselja. A recent Redbridge robo-phone survey of voting intentions which was funded by the Pocock campaign had Labor polling at 27%, followed by the Liberals at 24% and Pocock at 21%. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Australian Council of Trade Unions national secretary, Sally McManus, told the ABC on Wednesday Littleproud’s diagnosis of the fallout associated with the increased efficiency dividend was wrong. “Well, let’s be clear about this – it’s $3.3bn over four years that they’re ripping out of the public service,” McManus said. “Of course that means job losses.” “We estimate it’s over 5,000 job losses, and actually, that is just cuts to frontline services for Australians,” she said. “If you take out those workers … right across the public sector – that has a direct effect on every single Australian who depends especially on flood and fires, who depends on the public sector to be there and support them.”",News/Australia news,"Public sector cuts worth $3.3bn would not result in job losses, David Littleproud claims",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/public-sector-cuts-worth-33bn-would-not-result-in-job-losses-david-littleproud-claims
5/18/2022,"Widespread horror at the killing of shoppers at a Buffalo grocery store, allegedly by a white supremacist gunman, has been felt keenly in New Zealand as it continues to reckon with the ripple effects of the 2019 Christchurch massacre of 51 Muslims at prayer. New Zealand has already moved to ban the live stream video and “manifesto” apparently published by the alleged shooter, which is said to specifically cite the mosque shootings as a source of inspiration. Mosque attack survivors are being re-traumatised by the Buffalo footage, reportedly sent to them anonymously online, and researchers are concerned material from the shooting is spreading quickly inside New Zealand. The ban makes it illegal to possess or distribute the documents – which authorities say are a close imitation of those published by the Christchurch gunman. The document states that the alleged killer was “inspired by the March 15 mosque killer”, New Zealand acting chief censor Rupert Ablett-Hampson said, announcing the ban. “It has become a trend for terrorists, in particular white supremacist killers, to issue these kinds of publications to encourage others to follow their lead.” For the survivors of the attack in New Zealand, the news out of New York brought shock and distress – as well as reports that anonymous online actors were targeting and re-traumatising survivors by sending them streamed footage of the Buffalo attacks. Gamal Fouda, imam of al-Noor mosque, where the Christchurch attack took place, said in a statement posted to social media that he was “devastated by this terror attack in USA”. “My heart goes out to the people impacted by this heinous attack. Social media companies must stop people from using them as a platform for spreading hate,” he said. Fouda also shared a Stuff news report that the mosque shooting’s survivors were being targeted by anonymous online profiles sending them footage of the Buffalo shooting, thanking those who had reported it to the authorities. “Thank you for those who reported this hateful and violent misbehaviour,” he said. “There is no place for that kind of hateful ideology in New Zealand.” Stuff reported that at least three Christchurch survivors, who remained anonymous, had been sent footage of the Buffalo shootings. A police spokesperson would not comment on whether they had received complaints, but said they were “aware that objectionable material relating to the shooting in Buffalo, New York, is circulating online” and “charges may be considered if people within New Zealand are found to possess or share these materials”. Within New Zealand, researchers are concerned about the spread of copies of the alleged Buffalo terrorist’s propaganda, and say the country has developed fertile ground for extreme material among the pandemic era’s conspiratorial and anti-authoritarian movements. Dr Sanjana Hattotuwa, who studies disinformation and fringe online communities for Te Punaha Matatini research centre, said the researchers had observed the Buffalo live stream video and propaganda material spreading extensively within New Zealand groups they monitored. While it’s impossible to track the true number if people who have viewed the material on platforms such as Telegram, Hattotuwa said that New Zealand’s fringe and misinformation-spreading ecosystems had grown dramatically since the Christchurch attacks in 2019. Anti-vaccine factions had intermingled with far right and Q-Anon groups, and developed new, conspiratorial and extreme communities, typically hosted on Telegram. Within those groups, the Buffalo material was already spreading, he said, with several accounts that appeared to be expressly set up to disseminate the video and so-called manifesto. “The anti-vax landscape[s are the] ones who are front and centre, distributing, propagating and amplifying this content – that’s an entirely new phenomena that wasn’t there in March 2019,” he said. Many of the groups sharing the Buffalo material online were not directly glorifying it, Hattotuwa said – some believe it was a “false flag” or “distraction” set up by elites to divert attention. But he had concerns that its propagation meant it could spread to audiences who were receptive to radicalisation. “It doesn’t glorify it, but it doesn’t also push back on it. It normalises [the violence] as something that is … inevitable”. Ablett-Hampson told the Guardian that while the censor’s office had banned the alleged shooter’s specific manifesto, there was a variety of material surrounding it that did not reach New Zealand’s legal thresholds for a ban. “The other challenge is the underlying reasoning and rationale that this form of hate crime is based on. A lot of the recent attacks are based on that concept of “great replacement” theory and the disinformation that is built around that. I don’t have any power to classify a lot of [that material],” he said. “Those are very challenging issues for enforcement agencies – and I don’t think that’s just New Zealand.”",News/US news,Buffalo shooting: unease in New Zealand as live stream of ‘Christchurch-inspired’ attack finds foothold,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/buffalo-shooting-unease-in-new-zealand-as-live-stream-of-christchurch-inspired-attack-finds-foothold
