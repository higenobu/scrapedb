12/29/2021,"This Christmas, kids can step away from the grownups’ moronathon of unreality shows, reruns and mirthless laughter. Worzel Gummidge: Twitchers (BBC One) is a show for kids without a hint of tinsel, which defibrillates our seasonally stultified hearts and plumbs the philosophical depths. When I was a boy, it seemed inconceivable that Jon Pertwee, a Time Lord with a cape, a velvet jacket and an enviably blow-dried bouffant, could within a few weeks in the late 70s regenerate into a carrot-crunching rustic with straw hair and the look of a man who had mistaken cowpats for powder puffs. And yet it came to pass.  This year’s Worzel is stranger yet. Mackenzie Crook, who writes, directs and stars as the titular tatterdemalion, has chosen to hide under rubber one of the most recognisable and scarecrowy phizogs in Equity’s talent roster the better to play a man of straw and sticks. Only Charlie Cooper (Kurtan from This Country) would have been serious competition for the role. Maybe, and this is just a theory, Crook’s idea is to conceal his delectable bone structure to make us focus for once on his expressive eyes. Brown and soulful, Mackenzie’s swivel in their latex holes as he mumble-grumbles natural lore to captivated kids. Nonetheless, one thing that weirds me out is his beard: it is as if the special effects team had tried for sea lion’s whiskers, but settled for jellyfish’s undercarriage. We first see Worzel revelling in a rainstorm, asking God if that is the best he can do. There is, as the outdoorsman Alfred Wainwright realised, no such thing as the wrong weather, just the wrong clothes. And, as Worzel – a natural stoic – suggests, the wrong attitude. In this episode, Worzel explains that choughs are birds that belong to the crow family, after one of the charming siblings in his entourage – which also includes a variety of scarecrow pals – spots some choughs at a nearby farm. The red-legged interlopers have been blown inland by an idiot wind and the pressing matter now is how Worzel can add to the list of crows he has scared by terrifying these birds back to their natural habitat. It is a conundrum made more complicated by the fact that he needs to charm them to his own field before scaring them out of it. How do you charm a chattering of choughs? By first luring a squirm of worms to your field so that hungry choughs will be drawn to follow. But then how do scarecrows charm worms? Through the medium of nocturnal dance, Worzel explains. Well, obviously. The following morning, the worms are in position and, as day follows night, choughs have followed them. So, too, have adults – specifically, gangs of lens‑dangling birdwatchers and a crew from the local TV station. Nonetheless, Worzel and co begin the real business of crow scaring. One problem, though. Worzel’s dancing is insufficiently scary. So, he enlists his scarecrow chums, who emerge from hedgerows in various masks. What is the collective noun for mask-wearing scarecrows? An uncanniness. With psychological acuity singular in someone with straw for brains, Worzel realises that to scare choughs you must instil a sense of foreboding. So, he, the kids and the scarecrows simulate a storm by whooping, hollering and shaking metal sheets. Soon the choughs are heading off to Cornwall. This lovely episode reinforces the lesson that supposed lower life forms such as children and non-humans are the real grownups. Adults are so rancorous, dull-witted and perverted by the competitive spirit engendered by late capitalism that they are scarcely capable of thinking outside the box. When the TV news reporter invites one of the birdwatchers to appreciate the beauty of an eagle on the wing, he replies that he has already ticked it off in his book. For us adults, nature is to be pinned and mounted, not to be savoured. That is no way to live. Worzel Gummidge, rightly understood, invites spirit-crushed grownups to change. Detectorists, Mortimer and Whitehouse: Gone Fishing and now a paradoxical scarecrow have expressed in their very rustic longueurs our yearning to be more than homo economicus. We yearn to do what we mostly don’t: to run our fingers through grass and sit in trees; to look on nature without covetous eye; to re-enchant the world rather than exploit it to death. Dare we change our lives? Now would be a good time to start.",Arts/Television & radio,"Worzel Gummidge: Twitchers review – fighting capitalism, one scared crow at a time",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/28/worzel-gummidge-twitchers-review-fighting-capitalism-one-scared-crow-at-a-time
12/29/2021,"Revisit the week of the Rassie Erasmus rant and it is still striking that even if South Africa’s director of rugby had chosen to bite his lip rather than document his hour-long diatribe now synonymous with the Springboks’ series win, it would still go down as one of the most bizarre periods in rugby union’s turbulent year. The video emerged on the Thursday, by which stage Erasmus had already called out Mako Vunipola on Twitter for man-handling Cheslin Kolbe and held an extraordinary press conference in which he denied he was behind an account by the name of Jaco Johan, which flagged a number of perceived injustices and with which he was regularly engaging and agreeing.  For context, Erasmus felt that the British & Irish Lions had influenced the officials in the first Test – which they won 22-17 – by making it known that they were unimpressed with the appointment of the South African Marius Jonker as TMO. Even before that the trash-talking had started – Warren Gatland felt Faf de Klerk should have been given a red card in South Africa A’s victory over the tourists so Erasmus countered by picking at the low-hanging fruit: Owen Farrell’s tackle technique. Throw in Erasmus’s insistence on acting as South Africa’s water carrier and Gatland’s willingness to question it and it’s fair to say the mix was already combustible. It was in the week of the second Test that Erasmus grew desperate. During the build-up to the first Test he and South Africa’s head coach, Jacques Nienaber, had largely kept their counsel, but following defeat they seemingly reached the conclusion that it hadn’t worked and so they had to go on the offensive. If Erasmus’ press conference was as entertaining as it was extraordinary – “No, I’m actually not Jaco Johan, I’m Johan Erasmus … He’s a very big supporter, a really funny guy and I quite enjoy the things that he does” – he crossed the line from mischief to malice with the video. Erasmus highlighted 26 incidents in which he believed the referee, Nic Berry, and his team of assistants were at fault and suggested it was not just out of incompetence, referencing how he felt the Lions captain, Alun Wyn Jones, and his counterpart, Siya Kolisi – South Africa’s first ever black captain – were afforded different treatment. He lamented the officials’ refusal to give him feedback on demand and he even dared World Rugby to ban him for his decision to speak out. “If this means we are going to get a fine, I will step away from the management team,” he said. To dissect a referee’s performance like that – and for it to enter into the public domain – was egregious and it was to World Rugby’s shame that his punishment was not meted out for a further four months. The governing body’s lengthy verdict detailed the human toll Erasmus’ behaviour had on Berry, and brought with it some equally extraordinary revelations. Chiefly that Erasmus was found guilty of threatening Berry with the video’s publication and that in among the chaos of the week in question, the Australian referee took the time to answer each and every point Erasmus had by email, only to receive a one-world reply: thank you. Erasmus’ subsequent behaviour on social media has wavered between unashamed and unhinged – it also took a further week after the verdict of his hearing for him to finally apologise – but he is clearly emboldened, because to many South African supporters it is he who has been wronged. Erasmus, in his followers’ eyes, is unimpeachable, crusading against myriad injustices, a truth-teller bold enough to hold the powers-that-be to account. That, however, is to miss the point. Erasmus’ claims may have merit but considering his methods in airing them, the only suitable course of action for World Rugby to take was to promptly throw the book at him. And by that measure, it failed. World Rugby is a governing body that prioritises procedure over public perception and the short-term result was that Erasmus remained in position for the second and third Tests, and the first half of the former ended up being just as long as his video tirade, so paralysed by fear were the officials. It did not single-handedly ruin a series which arguably should not have been taking place at all – the Rugby Football Union, for one, has since privately acknowledged it should, in hindsight, have been a “home” series for the Lions as had been explored but ultimately rejected – but it hardly helped. And while Erasmus’ behaviour that week brought some much-needed colour to a drab series, it also denied it any oxygen to breathe. Because there can be little doubt that Erasmus’ actions were borne out of a willingness to do anything in his power to avoid defeat and that kind of desperation, that fear of failure, seeped into players on both sides. Yes, South Africa have an effective style, so too the Lions under Gatland, and neither is particularly pleasing on the eye. But given the amount of work and upheaval that went into getting the series on, the greatest disappointment was that there is little memorable about it beyond Rassie’s rant. Erasmus will not care less about that, but that is to rugby’s great shame and, at the very least, it should be a warning as to why a week like that cannot be allowed to happen again.",Sport/Sport,Jaw-dropping sport moments of 2021: Rassie Erasmus and his video rant,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/28/jaw-dropping-sport-moments-of-2021-rassie-erasmus-and-his-video-rant-british-irish-lions-springboks-rugby-union
