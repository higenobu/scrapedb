3/22/2022,"The governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Philip Lowe, has warned Australians they are set to take a real pay cut of 1.5% this year because sluggish wages growth won’t meet a surge in inflation. Lowe said he was hopeful the inflation spike was a one-off caused by supply chain disruption and soaring oil prices due to Russia invading Ukraine, but there were signs that business operators were increasingly willing to jack up prices. “The inflation rate at the moment is 3.5% and will probably go up to 4.5%, who knows, depending on what happens with oil prices,” Lowe told journalists at a Walkley Foundation lunch in Sydney on Tuesday. “Wages are maybe going up high twos, let’s say three, and inflation is 4.5% – that’s a real wage cut of 1.5%, so that will obviously affect people’s budgets.” He said inflation would “come back down again” and the wage cut needed to be balanced against an extra $250bn in savings banked by households during the pandemic, when people’s income was supported through the jobkeeper scheme and spending was limited by lockdowns and travel bans. “As long as inflation comes back down again households will manage through this and on average they’ve got a lot more money to help them,” he said. Real wages have been stagnant in Australia for almost a decade, frustrating Lowe, who said he would “like to see some bigger increases”. He said wages were lagging inflation because of state and federal pay rise caps and enterprise agreements that lock in wage rises at a fixed figure for several years. “There are two issues that are really on our mind at the moment. The first is how persistent the supply side problems are, how long are they going to keep pushing up prices and at what point will some of those price increases be reversed. “Because it’s quite possible that these big price increases occurred, that they’re not repeated, the prices normalise and after a spike inflation comes down again. “The second is what goes on in the labour market.” He said it was only possible for inflation to come back down from its spike if “labour costs don’t respond too much”. “The critical question, and again it’s an unknowable, is, is the inflation psychology in the country shifting?” There were signs of this happening, with business leaders more willing to announce price rises than previously and some enterprise agreements linking pay to inflation, instead of delivering a fixed increase every year. “There is a shift going on, but [we don’t know] how pervasive it is,” Lowe said. He said that in the past he had repeatedly asked business leaders who complained of staff shortages why they didn’t give bigger wage increases to attract staff and had in the past been told it was a competitive environment and they couldn’t afford to increase prices. “I think this cost control mentality was partly born out of that period of very high exchange rates during the commodity boom, when one Australian dollar was buying you US$1.10. “It was hard for Australian businesses to compete in the global market. “So this mentality got ingrained in that period that costs were too high… and that mentality I think reduced the willingness of firms to put up prices and wages. “There must be other reasons as well but that was one I kept coming across.”",News/Australia news,"Workers set to take a real pay cut of 1.5% as inflation surges, RBA boss warns",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/22/workers-set-to-take-a-real-pay-cut-of-15-as-inflation-surges-rba-boss-warns
3/22/2022,"In the music video for Lil Jon and DJ Snake’s sextuple-platinum banger Turn Down for What, an unspecified force possesses the pelvises of co-director Daniel Kwan and actor Sunita Mani, compelling them to twerk, dagger and gyrate with such intense ardor that they repeatedly blast through the floor and into the next level of a high-rise apartment complex. This is an OK summary of the waggish sense of humor at play in Kwan and co-director Daniel Scheinert’s new feature Everything Everywhere All at Once, a metaphysical martial arts epic that sees a butt plug as a potential source of power and arm-length dildos as an acceptable substitute for sai knives. (Also, Mani pops back up as a Bollywood star in a film-within-the-film.) But the early viral triumph from the film-making duo known simply as Daniels is most predictive in the way it thrusts the viewer through physical space with enough velocity to shatter its divisions, as if the Kool-Aid Man had spent all night pounding Jägerbombs and decided to upgrade his catchphrase to “FUCK YEAH!” Party time is over in Daniels’ hysterically ambitious latest, which expands its scope from a single building to the entirety of human history splayed across the full breadth of the multiverse, and accepts a weightier set of emotional stakes to match. Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh, unstoppable), a Chinese American immigrant/laundromat owner/last hope for all existence, slingshots between realities with the raw kinetic energy of a boulder launched by a trebuchet. Sometimes, she need only open a door to find herself in another iteration of her life, or walk backward through bushes, or tap the Bluetooth-earpiece-looking gizmos an ally gives her. Daniels delight in creatively collapsing the distance that separates scenes, lines of dialogue, or even shots, an all-out offensive of careening camera movement and frenetic editing that condenses what feels like 12 hours of movie into two and a half. And yet these often impressively nutso formal backflips land in a position of pedestrian sentimentality, and then upbraid anyone resisting the viscous flood of sap for their cynicism. Like many middle-aged people with a frustrating professional standing, a spouse (reedy-voiced Ke Huy Quan) they’ve forgotten how to relate to, and a child (Stephanie Hsu) they can’t understand, Evelyn spends a lot of time imagining the branching paths her years could have taken. Her mind wanders along these lines during a meeting with the tax auditor (Jamie Lee Curtis, paunchy and harsh and humane) informing her that she has one last chance to get her shit together, at which point both the narrative and lens fracture. As events progress in the “normal” chronology, dizzying cross-cuts flit between planes of being. The office complex turns into a beat-‘em-up gauntlet with some of the fiercest fight choreography of recent vintage in the American cinema; Evelyn winds up in a riff on Ratatouille with a hibachi raccoon; she and the auditor become lovers in a world where homo sapiens have hotdogs for fingers and pianos must be played by foot; as a movie star living out a moody Wong Kar-wai homage, she rues lost love. The Rick and Morty-fied spin on Jet Li vehicle The One can be exhausting, but plenty of rewarding things are. The trouble starts with the painfully hit-and-miss humor, vacillating between Douglas Adams absurdism (an everything bagel made literal threatens to swallow all of creation in its infinite void), sophomoric schoolyard yuks (forming the classic hand-vagina opens an inter-dimensional portal), and aren’t-I-random non sequiturs. The secret to hopping between universes is doing something statistically improbable, like eating Chapstick or putting your shoes on the wrong feet. After a failed attempt, Evelyn is told “not weird enough”, an indicator of the googly-eyed kooky-for-its-own-sake attitude at times unfortunately reminiscent of Natalie Portman’s wiggle dance in Garden State. The absolute earnestness required to get on board with the quirk factor in the first hour or so becomes crucial to stomaching the open-hearted affirmations of the latter half. The fixation on alternate timelines ultimately comes from a timely-ish anxiety that we’re now in the darkest one, evident in a vague line about how no one These Days knows their neighbors. The bagel of doom and its tightening grip on Evelyn’s Gen Z daughter lend themselves to the climactic declaration that there’s nothing worse than submitting to the nihilism so trendy with the next generation. Our lone hope of recourse is to embrace all the love and beauty surrounding us, if only we’re present enough to see it. These aren’t faulty ideas, and they’re delivered here with greater novelty than in the comparably sincere indies peddling these same feel-gooderies every Sundance can muster. A subtitled conversation between rocks on a barren planet locates the Don Hertzfeldt note of goofy profundity the film spends hours searching for, but the script then undermines its thin epiphanies by reiterating them a few times to ensure the audience has soaked in all the uplift. While those of us less susceptible to sentimentality may give it from a position of remote detachment, Kwan and Scheinert deserve some measure of recognition. They’ve constructed a large, elaborate, polished and detailed expression of a vision informed by a demented muse they staunchly refuse to stop following. It’s nice that we have two guys like this in the industry during a period characterized by a drought of visual distinction and personal authorship, and it’s hard to argue against the inevitability that a lot of people will get a lot out of this massive hunk of movie. All the same, the herculean effort to prove nothing short of the inherent worth in life itself comes up short, yielding little more than tweetable nuggets about how “we’re all small and stupid”. However dazzling the vortexes this film shoots us through at supersonic speed may be, they still deposit us somewhere we’ve been before.

3/22/2022,"Agreat aluminium ark has landed in the centre of Folkestone, like some futuristic container ship run aground. Its steeply sloping sides are covered with a skin of crushed metal mesh that wraps the hulking vessel from blank stern to flaring prow, punctuated only by a few triangular windows. There’s no hint of what it might contain – until you get closer and see big bowl-like shapes bulging down from the ceiling and bursting into the glass facade above the entrance. Step inside and you find yourself beneath a billowing cloud of concrete that ripples and swells with the unmistakable undulations of a skatepark, as the sound of speeding wheels rattles overhead. “We were originally asked to design a multistorey car park,” says Guy Hollaway, architect of F51, as this gleaming arrival to the Kent seaside town is known. “But when a nearby skatepark had to be relocated we were asked to incorporate it into the design. The client increasingly thought the cars looked boring, so we got rid of them and made the world’s first multistorey skatepark instead. The client in question is Sir Roger de Haan, a local businessman and philanthropist who sold the Saga holidays empire for £1.3bn in 2004, and has since pumped millions into the regeneration of Folkestone. His charitable trust has funded the construction of an academy school and a sports centre, set up numerous galleries and studios, and transformed the harbour with a new promenade. Having sprinkled the town with munificent regenerative fairy dust, and cemented the place as a cultural capital with the Folkestone Triennial, De Haan has now embarked on a vast development of luxury flats on the beachfront. Currently rising from the sands, the 1,000-home project, 8% of which will be affordable, has polarised the town. Some see it as welcome further investment, others as naked property speculation aimed at out-of-town buyers. “He’s doing the opposite to most developers,” says Hollaway, “investing a huge amount in the community before building the flats, rather than doing it as a token gesture afterwards.” F51 is certainly far beyond what any developer would normally cough up: a £17m “adrenaline building”, gifted to the town. The phrase world-first is overused, but there really is nothing quite like this anywhere else on the planet. It is a wild triple-decker sandwich of kickflips and ollies, along with the tallest indoor climbing wall in, well, south-east Britain, all floating above a boxing gym and cafe. The drawings for the building look like something from an improbable student project: climbers scale one side of the structure, as skateboarders leap past them, pumping between mounds and quarter pipes, while a boxing match is in full swing down below, beneath the rippling rack of floors. There are continual views between the different parts of the building, which expands outwards as it rises, forming a dynamic sense of a place buzzing and bursting out at the seams. In the view of Iain Borden, architectural historian and author of Skateboarding and the City, it’s a gamechanger, “as startling and shocking as the 1955 Citroën DS was for automobile design, and as cohesive and timely as the 2007 iPhone was for smartphones”. The three different levels cater to all ages and abilities, ranging from shallow ramps for beginners to concrete bowls deep enough to keep even the most fearless Olympians entertained. The more gentle flow park at the top of the building is a seamless wooden world, conceived with skaters, scooters and BMXers in mind. It is dotted with mounds (or “pump bumps”) and volcanoes, where the floor rises to merge into the building’s hefty concrete columns, while a “vert” ramp launches riders up seemingly within reach of the orange steel beams that shoot across the ceiling, five metres overhead. The middle floor houses a “street park”, which is equipped with features that recall the urban landscape, with steps, rails and ledges to slide and grind across – also made of plywood to allow the park to be easily updated as skating evolves. Made by specialists Cambian, the wooden floors have been crafted like fine cabinetry, each piece of the complex jigsaw cut in their Sussex factory then hand-finished on site. Cutouts on both levels provide vertiginous views of the climbing wall, designed as a three-sided crevasse, with plenty of overhangs and an Olympic spec speedwall, with big red buttons to time your ascent. Finally, the first floor is home to the spectacular bowl park, a sculptural symphony of polished concrete that plunges and swells in heart-stopping swoops, as if commanded by the late Zaha Hadid. On one side is what’s known as a capsule bowl, along with skateable columns where the floor curves up between two massive pillars. These are a nod to the famous Burnside DIY skatepark in Portland, Oregon, built by a group of skateboarders beneath a bridge in the 1990s, that has since become a touchstone for such makeshift skateparks around the world. In a similar vein, there’s a pool, complete with a frieze of swimming pool tiles and specialist stone coping, inspired by the empty swimming pools in California where skateboarding started out. “We wanted to emulate the origins of bowl-skating in Dogtown,” says Hollaway, referring to the nickname for Santa Monica in the 1970s, where skateboarders began testing their skills in pools that had been drained due to drought. F51’s pool features vertical sides and a double waterfall, as the transition between levels is called, plunging to almost three metres at the deep end. “It’s a legit pool that will challenge even the most expert of riders,” says Borden. The work of specialist skatepark firm Maverick, which is more used to casting its concrete landscapes straight into the ground, the bowl floor was made all the more complex by having to be suspended in midair. A primary concrete slab was first cast into carved polystyrene moulds, to create the visible bulging underside, with a secondary layer of concrete sprayed on top, hand-trowelled to a smooth finish with the care of icing a cake. Begun in 2015, and delayed for several years by technical difficulties and Covid, the opening of the project is well timed to catch the recent boom in skateboarding. The pandemic saw the biggest increase since 2000, when the release of the Tony Hawk Pro Skater game sparked new interest, and skateboard sales rose by more than 30% last year. There are now 1,650 outdoor parks across the UK and 65 indoor ones, according to Skateboard GB, the new national governing body established since skateboarding became an Olympic sport for Tokyo 2020 – an event that saw a further spike for the sport, particularly among girls, after 13-year-old Sky Brown scooped a bronze for Britain. “We’re keen to counter the idea that if you don’t play team sports you’re not sporty,” says Dan Hulme of the Sports Trust, the branch of De Haan’s charitable foundation charged with running F51. Their coaching programme with local schools will run skateboarding classes as well as workshops covering graphic design, videography and skatepark design. “It provides a pathway into so many different areas,” he says. It’s a markedly different approach to when skating fever first swept the UK in the 1970s, spawning several commercial indoor skateparks that turned out to be expensive failures. In 1978, two major London parks opened: Rolling Thunder in Brentford, which had an astonishing concrete landscape cast inside a former market hall; and Mad Dog Bowl, the biggest such skatepark in Europe at the time, housed in the former Astoria cinema on the Old Kent Road. “They were amazing places,” says Borden, who began skating as a 15-year-old in 1977. “But they got their timing and attitude completely wrong. The skateboarding boom was already fading away by the time they opened, and they were run like golf clubs, with expensive membership fees and officious management, so most closed by the 1980s.” By contrast, F51 will offer £1 monthly after-school membership to local kids, with skateboarding planned to be actively built into the curriculum of the academy school. “Skateparks are so often in dingy out-of-town locations,” says Hollaway. “We wanted this to be a beacon right in the centre, saying to young people, ‘You’re the most important customer in town – because you are the future.’”",Arts/Art and design,‘A wild triple-decker sandwich’: world’s first multistorey skatepark lands in Folkestone,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/22/wild-triple-decker-sandwich-worlds-first-multistorey-skatepark-lands-in-folkestone
3/22/2022,"Before we even reach the opening titles of Then Barbara Met Alan – the BBC’s one-off drama depicting the fight for the 1995 Disability Discrimination Act (DDA), which aired on Monday night – Barbara has graffitied “piss on pity” on a bus stop and turned down going for a drink with Alan because, in her words, she’d just end up getting drunk and giving him a blowjob. It is an instruction to the audience from the off to reject their preconceptions: this is not disabled people as you might think. The story of how disabled activists – led by Barbara Lisicki and Alan Holdsworth – used direct action to lobby for the UK’s first disability civil rights law is one you’d be forgiven for not having heard before. Disability history is not taught in schools. It is not dramatised for entertainment and is rarely the subject of documentaries; on the odd occasion that the subject is on British screens, it’s likely to have been from the US – as in the 2020 documentary Crip Camp. As a result, I’d wager most of the British public think disability rights were introduced in the 1970s along with other anti-discrimination laws, like those legislating against sex and race prejudice, and came about by benevolent authorities gifting rights to the grateful disabled. As Then Barbara Met Alan shows, this couldn’t be further from the truth. When Take That were top of the charts and Rachel and Ross were “will they, won’t they?” in Friends, disabled people in the UK still had no basic rights enshrined in law. That meant it was perfectly legal for a company not to hire someone because they were Deaf or for a bus not to have ramps and be unable to take wheelchair-using passengers. These moments of everyday inequality are cleverly represented in the show and the characters’ lives. When Barbara and Alan get arrested for protesting about a lack of disability access, they have to be kept in a police van because the cells aren’t accessible. It’s a moment of irony that makes clear just how preposterous discrimination is once you really start to think about it. One of the most striking parts of the programme comes when Barbara and her friends decide to protest over ITV Telethon, a charity drive show that raised money for disability charities, but really served to reinforce negative stereotypes about “pitiable crips”. Interspersed with real historical footage of bemused host Chris Tarrant and protesters, it sums up in just a few scenes how, for decades, British society was content to hand out charity to its disabled citizens but not rights. When change did come, it was not thanks to kindly non-disabled politicians and media organisations, but the fury and power of wheelchair users throwing themselves under buses. Their demands were simultaneously uncompromising and unremarkable. As the campaigners chant to passersby: “We want what you’ve got! Civil. Rights.” That Then Barbara Met Alan is built around a love story between the two campaigners is itself refreshingly subversive. A society that often others disabled people as sexless, passive and sad naturally sees no need to grant them access to pubs, cinemas or gigs. On an early date, we see Alan and Barbara stopped from going into a restaurant because there’s no ramp. As a sign of what’s to come, Alan insists on challenging the manager and a waiter promptly brings a table out to the pavement so the couple can at least have their date outside. “We fight every battle,” Alan implores Barbara. “Do you understand that? Every battle.” It would be a mistake to watch the show and think the story is over. As Alan himself says, after storming the House of Commons when the DDA is finally passed: “It won’t be enough. But it will be a start.” Any disabled person who has recently been unlawfully turned down for a job, denied healthcare during the pandemic, or been left to wet themselves on a train because there’s no accessible toilet knows this all too well. Research published this week by Euan’s Guide, the disability access charity, found that 59% of disabled people believe the pandemic has made access worse. Progress is a slow game. And yet I can’t help but feel a little hope. Watching Then Barbara Met Alan, I was struck not only by the power of disabled activists but of seeing their story told in the mainstream. This was disability rights front and centre on primetime television, played by disabled actors and created by disabled storytellers. By the time the real-life Barbara was on screen in the final scene – with a ramp symbolically coming out of a bus to finally give her entry – I was crying. For what we gained. For what was taken from us for decades, and still is. For the campaigners who gave so much for my generation and those that do today. Roar in the streets and kiss your lover. This is what disability looks like – and the battle continues.

3/22/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is primarily Vladimir Putin’s war, but if there is a second man whose name and reputation will be tied to the devastation unleashed by Moscow it is Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. His fighters were part of the first wave assault on the country, and died in large numbers around the Hostomel airbase, with one key commander among those killed. Elite Chechen squads were also reportedly recruited for failed attempts to assassinate key Ukrainian leaders in the first 48 hours of the invasion, western intelligence said. More recently Kadyrov’s men have appeared among forces imposing a brutal siege on the port city of Mariupol, where targets have included a maternity hospital and the suffering of hundreds of thousands has become emblematic of Ukrainian pain. And the Chechen leader himself even posted a video on social media recently, which he claimed was a strategy session filmed in a basement bunker in Ukraine. He used it to menace Kyiv residents with the prospect of a “personal visit”. Ukrainian intelligence services say the video was likely false bravado, filmed at home in Chechnya. Intelligence from phones and internet suggested he never crossed into Ukraine, and even Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to endorse the video, saying the Kremlin had “no data” on a possible trip into Ukraine. But regardless of veracity, the footage was useful propaganda, signalling how closely and enthusiastically Kadyrov has associated himself with this war. He appears to see the invasion of Ukraine as an opportunity to boost both his power and his profile. Sending his men is a way for Kadyrov to prove his loyalty to the Russian leader whose patronage is the basis of his authority. “There are many thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of Chechens who hate him, who resent him and many families who are in a state of latent blood feud against him and his family, so Kadyrov understands if he wants to to survive he needs Russia and Vladimir Putin’s backing,” said Emil Solomon Aslan from the Institute of Political Studies at Charles University in Prague. “That’s why he wants to display absolute loyalty, show he is useful, can come and do very grandiose stuff.” They are somewhat irregular forces for Russia to deploy. There is constant feuding between Chechen commanders and Russian intelligence, including petty public insults (a recent video showed fighters using feminine grammar to mock a male FSB leader) and little integration with the regular army. In videos, troops highlight that they are under the command of Kadyrov, not the Russian military hierarchy. Unlike Russians, the Chechen troops carry mobile phones, post to social media and call the conflict a war – ignoring the Kremlin’s propaganda ruling that the carnage must be called a “special operation”. Their prominent role despite all this is a tribute to Kadyrov’s reach, a public show of how a great power’s military depends on his band of Chechen fighters. This month he launched an Arabic language channel on Telegram, apparently to capitalise on that prominence, an ambitious move for the leader of a small, non-Arabic speaking Russian region. He has tried to present the mobilisation as something backed across Chechen society, with schoolteachers ordered to make lists of people with space in their homes to “shelter refugees”, and claims that some government employees would forego a month’s salary because they “donated it to the war”. For Putin, the Chechen leader offers experienced fighters, honed in vicious wars of attrition against insurgency and in street-to-street fighting which is already ripping apart several Ukrainian cities. Their reputation for brutality is a weapon in itself. “Kadyrov has long experience of so-called ‘cleansing operations’ [against civilians], and his fighters may be used as psychological tool against peaceful Ukrainians,” said Aleksandre Kvakhadze, a research fellow at the Georgian Foundation for Strategic and International Studies, focused on the north Caucusus. “The implicit threat is there: if you don’t surrender, you may meet the same fate as peaceful cities in Georgia and Chechnya. “Also, the older generation of Chechen fighters participated at some point in defence of Grozny, when they were fighting against Russia. So Russian commanders believe in this sense his forces have skills that may be useful in Ukraine, especially during things like the siege of Mariupol.” Kadyrov, who runs Chechnya as a personal fiefdom through fear and violence, may even offer inspiration in dictatorship to the Russian leader, as the economy crumbles under sanctions and Putin moves ever deeper into autocracy. He has traditionally offered the Kremlin a kind of alternative enforcement network, for intelligence gathering and taking out enemies too toxic or controversial for regular spy services. Perhaps most prominently, five Chechens were found guilty of the 2015 murder of Boris Nemtsov, a leading opposition figure, although the crime was never directly tied to Kadyrov. As the Kremlin seeks scapegoats for failures in Ukraine, with the FSB chief for the country reportedly under house arrest, these roles as enforcers and in intelligence gathering may prove even more useful, particularly as there has been historical enmity between the two camps. Many Chechens felt they were sent as cannon fodder to a badly planned war in the early days, when their heavy losses included a senior commander. Now they seem more focused on a media war, aimed at driving recruits and bolstering their leader. At home, Kadyrov has been pushing hard for “volunteers”, who are offered a sign-on bonus of about $2,300 (£1,750) and pay of $1,000 a month, with extra for successful operations, one recruiter said in text messages to a prospective young fighter. They have approached groups including martial arts coaches asking young men to sign up, but Chechens are apparently mostly unmoved, aware how lethal the war has become. “The footage and metadata show most [Chechen] forces are at least 20km [12 miles] away from the frontline, the only things they do is record videos to motivate people inside Chechnya and promote the warrior image of Kadyrov and his forces,” Kvakhadze said. “They are putting in a lot of effort to mobilise ‘volunteers’, offered very generous financial reward for participating, but Telegram and leaks suggest it is not successful.” Kadyrov also has one other reason to fight. Lined up with the Ukrainian forces are at least two brigades that include members of the Chechen diaspora who loathe him, and would like to see him overthrown. He needs to show enemies at home and abroad his strength, but he needs to keep his forces intact to prop up his brutal rule. “Kadyrov seems to have been shocked by the scope of Ukrainian resistance, and it seems that dozens if not hundreds of his people have been killed. He has a lot of people, around 12,000, but to stay in power he needs those fighters,” Aslan said. “If they suffer too much serious damage in Ukraine, this could backfire for Kadyrov. This might explain some of the rumours he rolled back some of his forces. “He wants to show himself as a tough leader of these tough fighters who are willing to self-sacrifice. But I’m not really sure if they are willing to give up their lives.”",News/World news,Chechnya’s losses in Ukraine may be leader Ramzan Kadyrov’s undoing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/chechnyas-losses-in-ukraine-may-be-leader-ramzan-kadyrovs-undoing
3/22/2022,"A new study seeks to answer a key question: what does it mean when a pig oinks, squeals or grunts? In the study published earlier this month, researchers from the University of Copenhagen, ETH Zurich and the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment recorded 7,414 sounds from 411 pigs in different scenarios. The researchers then developed an algorithm to decode whether pigs were experiencing a positive emotion, negative emotion or something in between. The recordings were collected in situations encountered by commercial pigs from birth to death, the University of Copenhagen said. Researchers also monitored behavior and heart rates. “Due to the impact of emotions on vocalization, the analysis of vocal expression of emotions is increasingly being considered as an important non-invasive tool to assess the affective aspects of animal welfare,” the study said. It added: “In the last decade, it has been shown that vocalizations of various animal species produced in specific emotional contexts and/or physiological states display specific acoustic characteristics.” Positive situations include when piglets suckle from their mothers or when they are reunited with family members. Negative situations include separation, fights, castration and slaughter. Researchers also developed mock scenarios designed to evoke more nuanced emotions. Such scenarios included an arena holding toys or food and a corresponding arena without any such stimuli. They also introduced new and unfamiliar objects. The study revealed that pigs typically vocalize high-frequency calls such as screams or squeals in negative situations, while low-frequency calls such as barks and grunts occur when pigs experience both positive and negative emotions. “There are clear differences in pig calls when we look at positive and negative situations,” said Elodie Briefer, a professor at the University of Copenhagen’s biology department who co-led the study. “In the positive situations, the calls are far shorter, with minor fluctuations in amplitude. Grunts, more specifically, begin high and gradually go lower in frequency. “By training an algorithm to recognize these sounds, we can classify 92% of the calls to the correct emotion.” According to the researchers, most modern animal welfare efforts focus on physical health. Briefer said: “We need someone who wants to develop the algorithm into an app that farmers can use to improve the welfare of their animals” including their emotions.",News/Science,"Oink, oink: scientists decode pig emotions from their sounds",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/22/oinks-squeals-grunts-scientists-decode-pig-emotions
3/22/2022,"Ever wondered what your road or area looked like 50 or 100 years ago? Historic England is launching an aerial photography tool that allows users to explore images of England over the past century. The bird’s eye views range from second world war defences and nuclear power stations to the remains of neolithic monuments, Roman farmsteads and medieval villages. More than 400,000 photographs from 1919 to the present day, covering 30% of England, will be available to search and view online for the first time. They include images of the remains of a neolithic long barrow near Broughton, Hampshire, iron age forts such as Pilsdon Pen in Dorset and medieval villages such as Old Sulby in Northamptonshire. There are photos of second world war defensive measures such as anti-aircraft obstructions at Hampton Court Palace and camouflaged runways at RAF Kenley in 1941. Images of Greenwich Park in 1946 show it covered in a patchwork of allotments for food after it aided the war effort. A modern photo from August 2006 shows outlines of the allotments appearing through the grass in hot weather. Bomb damage can be seen in images of central Liverpool and the Albert Dock from 1941, 1946 and 1948. Other photographs of note are of 20th-century industrial sites, such as the construction of Tilbury power station in 1955 and its demolition in 2017, and famous buildings, such as views of St James’ Park football stadium in Newcastle from the 1920s and St Paul’s Cathedral after the war. Last year Historic England launched a digital aerial archaeology tool that allows people to discover archaeological details about local landscapes. Duncan Wilson, Historic England’s chief executive, said: “I am delighted that our new online tool will allow people to access easily our wonderful collection of aerial images and enjoy the historic photography that our team uses every day to unlock the mysteries of England’s past.” Nigel Huddleston, the heritage minister, said the tool offered “a bird’s eye view of our past” and encouraged “everyone to explore the thousands of English sites from the last century”.",Arts/Culture,Historic England puts aerial photos of nation’s past online,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/22/historic-england-puts-aerial-photos-of-nations-past-online
3/22/2022,"Up to 3,000 cases of oil dumped by commercial ships may be happening every year in European waters, according to a new investigation, which found the scale of illegal “bilge dumping” is likely to be far higher than publicly acknowledged. Bilge water is a mix of liquids from the engine room of a ship along with other potentially toxic substances including lubricants, cleaning solvents and metals such as lead and arsenic, which collects at the bottom of the vessel. Dealing with this oily wastewater – by treating it to remove pollutants or by offloading it at port – is expensive. To cut down on operational costs, some ships simply dump it directly into the ocean, where it can pose a serious threat to marine life. A six-month investigation by Lighthouse Reports, a European non-profit newsroom, with nine publications across Europe, used satellite technology, whistleblowers’ testimonies and freedom of information requests to document hundreds of incidents of potentially illegal oil spills from ships. It found that despite the use of sophisticated satellite technology, countries were slow to act and prosecution levels were low, leading to what some experts say is a culture of impunity. In Europe, marine oil spills are monitored by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) through its CleanSeaNet initiative, launched in 2007, which analyses satellite images to detect potential oil discharges from ships. When the system identifies a potential spill, it sends an alert to the relevant EU country, which can observe the slick by sending out a boat or plane or by asking a nearby vessel to inspect it – sometimes the satellite picks up algal blooms or legal discharges of vegetable or fish oil. The national authority can then feed its findings back to EMSA. But annual CleanSeaNet data, which EMSA started publishing for the first time in 2021, reveals that feedback levels are low. In 2020, the agency recorded 7,672 detections of potential oil spills. It received feedback for only a third of these, of which 208 were confirmed to be oil slicks. The longer the interval between an alert and an on-site check, the higher the chance of the countries reporting “nothing observed”, according to a 2021 report from EMSA and the European Environment Agency. In 2019, only 1.5% of 7,939 alerts of potential oil spills were verified by authorities within three hours. Experts argue that slow response times, combined with limited public data provided by EMSA, reduce accountability. The agency’s report for 2020 does not disclose detection dates or provide information on the likely source of pollution. A spokesperson for EMSA said this was to avoid revealing “sensitive information” about monitoring and investigations, “which could support polluters in evading detection”. Even if countries identify potential illegal bilge dumping in their waters, they do not have to disclose what action is subsequently taken. “This is a problem that’s been invisible to the public,” said John Amos, president of SkyTruth, an environmental watchdog that has been using satellite data to track illegal bilge dumping since 2011. “You can give governments all the best tools in the world but if there’s no public accountability and pressure for them to use those tools, problems will not get fixed.” SkyTruth used EMSA data to calculate how many spills may be avoiding detection because of gaps in coverage by satellites, which are in orbit and do not constantly monitor the ocean, and the rate at which slicks dissipate. “Taking the CleanSeaNet results at face value, and accounting for the frequency of the satellite imagery and the lifespan of a typical oil slick, SkyTruth estimates there may be nearly 3,000 oil slicks every year caused by vessels transiting EU waters,” said Amos. Ships have developed tactics to avoid detection, according to whistleblowers’ testimony collected by Lighthouse Reports and reporting partners, including using portable pumps to discharge untreated bilge water into the ocean and dumping at night or in rough seas when it’s harder to see the oil. One whistleblower, who worked in a ship’s engine room, described the ease of bilge dumping using a portable pump. “You can assemble this portable pump in five minutes and then detach for five minutes and hide if somebody is coming,” he said. The dumping would often happen after dark, at about 10pm, the whistleblower said. Raising the alarm can be very difficult, according to another whistleblower, a ship’s engineer, who observed illegal bilge dumping. He said he was told by the chief engineer: “Be quiet, do not speak out. If you speak then it is very much trouble for you.” When he confronted the chief engineer, his contract was terminated, he said. Both men asked to remain anonymous for fear of the consequences of speaking out. Bilge dumps do not tend to receive the same attention as large industrial spills because they are smaller and less visible but experts argue the frequency with which they are happening is having a big effect on marine life. A 2016 study on short-lived oil spills found “immediate adverse biological effects” on marine life, including a decline in numbers of plankton in the sea. Maritime oil pollution has “direct toxic effects” on the smallest marine creatures, said Kerstin Magnusson, an ecotoxicologist at the Swedish Environmental Research Institute and author of a report that linked bilge dumping to negative impacts on the feeding and reproduction of Acartia tonsa, tiny zooplankton that form a vital part of the base of the ocean food chain. This has an impact all the way up the food web, she said, adding: “It’s a network of effects and consequences.” Penalties for illegal bilge dumping can include fines – Carnival’s Princess Cruises was fined $40m in 2016 after pleading guilty to bilge dumping along the British coast. In some cases prison sentences are given to individuals found responsible. But enforcement is sporadic, say experts, and even when fines are imposed, they may not be high enough to deter the behaviour. “Even if an oil sample is taken after the fact and they find out which ship the oil came from, the likelihood of the polluters being fined a large amount is minimal,” said Christian Bussau, a marine biologist with Greenpeace. “There is still a certain incentive, for cost reasons, to illegally dump oil at sea,” he said. Maja Markovčić Kostelac, executive director of EMSA, said: “Illegal discharges of oil and other polluting substances still regularly occur in European waters, albeit the number of detections, as well as the number of prosecutions, remains low.” She said the agency’s CleanSeaNet programme “has so far proven to be an important resource at EU level for monitoring maritime areas, providing rapid detection alerts that allow for prompt follow-up actions.” In response to claims of a lack of transparency, a spokesperson for EMSA said: “The agency can only disclose feedback and verification data when approved by the coastal states.” They added that information on prosecutions related to illegal oil dumps was the responsibility of coastal states, not EMSA.",News/Environment,"Revealed: ships may dump oil up to 3,000 times a year in Europe’s waters",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/22/revealed-ships-may-dump-oil-up-to-3000-times-a-year-in-europes-waters
3/22/2022,"The celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has said it is good that the Covid-19 pandemic wiped the slate clean of “crap” restaurants. In an interview with the former shadow chancellor Ed Balls in Radio Times, Ramsay argues that while the past two years have been “devastating” for the restaurant industry, the upside is “the crap’s gone”. Promoting his new BBC One primetime show, Gordon Ramsay’s Future Food Stars, in which 12 food and drink entrepreneurs vie to go into business with Ramsay, he said the pandemic had taught everyone in the industry to “raise their game”. As well as independent businesses, hundreds of restaurant chains closed branches for good, including Carluccio’s, Byron Burger, Ask, Zizzi, Bella Italia, Café Rouge, Frankie & Benny’s, Chiquitos, Gourmet Burger Kitchen and Pizza Express. The restaurant and wider hospitality sector was one of the industries hit hardest during the pandemic with misery caused for hundreds of thousands of people who lost their jobs or missed out on seasonal employment. The trade association UK Hospitality said at its peak there were almost 700,000 jobs affected – a combination of job losses plus jobs that did not happen due to tourist seasons being heavily affected. Asked by Balls if business was returning to the hospitality industry, Ramsay said: “The business was on its arse, but it’s getting better … It’s been devastating the last two years. Landlords don’t say, ‘Take a holiday for two years’. But I think what has been evident for all of us is the crap’s gone.” Pressed if he was referring to particular chains, Ramsay said: “Well, just shitholes in a prime position and taking advantage because they’re in a great location, and they’ve got the footfall. But now we’ve wiped the slate clean, which is good.” He added: “Customers have got so much smarter in the last two years. They know a lot more about food than they ever have done and have been making their own sourdough, so it’s taught everyone [in the restaurant industry] to raise their game … It’s wiped the arrogance from the industry.” Ramsay also defended his lockdown trip to his home in Cornwall, saying it gave him cherished time with his children. He said: “We got there at an appropriate time and had an absolutely amazing time. And a time like that – we’ll never get back again. “When the kids started disappearing again, I didn’t want it to end – as a dad, not a chef.”",Lifestyle/Food,"Covid wiped slate clean of ‘crap restaurants’, says Gordon Ramsay",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/22/covid-wiped-slate-clean-of-crap-restaurants-says-gordon-ramsay
3/22/2022,"When the owners of a Tennessee comics shop learned that a local school board had voted to remove Art Spiegelman’s Holocaust classic Maus from its curriculum, they sprang into action with an appeal calling for donations to fund free copies for schoolchildren. Within hours, money started pouring in from all over the world. “We had donations from Israel, the UK and Canada as well as from the US,” says Richard Davis, co-owner of Nirvana Comics. Ten days later, they closed the appeal, after raising $110,000 (£84,000) from 3,500 donors. “We bought up all the copies the publisher had in its warehouse and we’re now in the process of shipping 3,000 copies of Maus to students all over the country, along with a study guide written by a local schoolteacher,” says Davis, who has relied on volunteers to help with the distribution. For Spiegelman, it has meant an exponential sales boost for a 30-year-old book – the only graphic novel to win a Pulitzer prize, in 1992 – and a flurry of speaking engagements across the country. “It just shows,” he says, “you can’t ban books unless you’re willing to burn them and you can’t burn them all unless you’re willing to burn the writers and the readers too.” That’s just as well, adds the 74-year-old cartoonist, “because this is the most Orwellian version of society I’ve ever lived in. It’s not as simple as left v right. It’s a culture war that’s totally out of control. As a first-amendment fundamentalist, I believe in the right of anyone to read anything, provided they are properly supported. If a kid wants to read Mein Kampf, it’s better to do it in a library or school environment than to discover it on Daddy’s shelves and be traumatised.” Unfortunately, there is an unprecedented rise in attempts to remove books from the US’s libraries and schools. The American Library Association (ALA) told the Guardian that in the period from 1 September to 30 November, more than 330 unique cases were reported – more than double the number for the whole of 2020, and nearing the total for the previous (pre-pandemic) year. “It’s definitely getting worse,” says Suzanne Nossel, the CEO of the free-speech organisation PEN America, which has led the resistance against book banning for more than a decade. “We used to hear about a book challenge or ban a few times a year. Now it’s every week or every day. We also see proposed legislative bans, as opposed to just school districts taking action. It is part of a concerted effort to try to hold back the consequences of demographic and social change by controlling the narratives available to young people.” Predominantly, the ALA reported, the challenges were targeted at “the voices of the marginalised … books and resources that mirror the lives of those who are gay, queer or transgender, or that tell the stories of persons who are Black, Indigenous or persons of colour”. Or, as Spiegelman says, of his own experience: “If I was a transgender Black great-grandchild of slaves, I’d be more likely to be banned. This feels like a drive-by shooting.” Maus was removed on the basis of eight swearwords – mainly “God damn” – and nudity: a bare-breasted, suicidal mouse representing Spiegelman’s mother, who killed herself when he was 20 years old. The ironic thing about it, says the cartoonist, is that he never intended the book for children, but wrote it to work out his own feelings about the parental legacy of the Holocaust. “I was a bit offended at first when I learned that it was being used in schools, but, after speaking to young people who had read the books [it was originally published in two volumes], I just had to drop my prejudice and accept they were fine with it.” Many of the challenges centre on a moral hysteria about the protection of children. “They’re playing woke snowflakery back: ‘This might upset people’,” says Margaret Atwood in an email to me. A graphic novel version of Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale was one of the books removed from classroom libraries in a Texas school district in December, along with two other dystopian graphic novel classics: an adaptation of Shirley Jackson’s The Lottery, and Alan Moore’s V for Vendetta. Texas sensitivities about The Handmaid’s Tale are not new for Atwood, who directs me to an open letter she wrote in 2006 to a school authority after learning that it had decided to remove the novel because of sexual explicitness and offence to Christians (a decision that was overturned after impassioned representations from students). “First,” she wrote, “the remark: ‘Offensive to Christians’ amazes me. Nowhere in the book is the regime identified as Christian. As for sexual explicitness, The Handmaid’s Tale is a lot less interested in sex than is much of the Bible.” Though the current censorship drive in the US is predominantly in Republican states, it has become a tit-for-tat controversy, with conservative commentators quick to point out that the left has its own form in censoring classics such as To Kill a Mockingbird or Huckleberry Finn for their perceived racist content. “The only ones banning books are critical race theorists,” wrote the Jewish News Syndicate columnist Daniel Greenfield. “Erstwhile liberals, who had once vocally championed Huck and Mockingbird and shouted down any effort to keep them out of the classroom, now just as vocally want them out and replaced with … Ta-Nehisi Coates and Ibram X Kendi.” Ta-Nehisi Coates’s memoir Between the World and Me, written as a letter to his teenage son, was among more than 800 books about social justice identified for removal from Texas schools by a state legislator last year, on the basis that they were “liable to make students feel discomfort, guilt, anguish or any other form of psychological distress because of their race or sex”. Kendi’s profile, as director of the Center for Antiracist Research at Boston University and the author of three influential books on the history of racism in the US (as well as a children’s book), has made him a lightning rod in the row over critical race theory, which – according to the Brookings Institute thinktank – has become “a new bogeyman for people unwilling to acknowledge our country’s racist history and how it impacts the present”. The relationship between book challenges and attempts to control public debate is particularly obvious in this arena, with Brookings reporting in November that nine states (Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Arizona, and North Dakota) had already passed legislation against the teaching of critical race theory, with a further 20 either in the process of doing so, or planning to. “We do see increased resort to censoriousness on both the left and the right,” says Nossel. “On the left, it targets books that some people regard as racially offensive, sometimes because they originate from a different time period, when slurs were used more widely than is acceptable now. But it is the right that has invoked the machinery of government – including legislative proposals in dozens of states – to enforce these bans and prohibitions. In the hierarchy of infringements of free speech that must be recognised as more severe and alarming.” She adds: “There must be room for communities to debate what books and curriculum should be made available to students at various levels of education, and parents deserve a say. But ideologically driven crusades to ban particular narratives and viewpoints infringe upon open discourse in the classroom.” It is not only in Tennessee that an alarmed progressive public has responded by pouring money into the pushback. In February, Markus Dohle, the CEO of the publisher Penguin Random House, said he would personally donate at least $500,000 to PEN America to kickstart a new fund to fight book banning, while PRH itself pledged a further $100,000. Such high stakes might seem unthinkable in the UK, where censorship technically ended with the abolition of the Lord Chamberlain’s role as theatre censor in 1968. “Banning for swearwords – as in the Maus case – is a peculiarly US thing, as is banning books for sex, like Judy Blume’s Forever was from some US state libraries for a long time,” says Julia Eccleshare, the director of the Hay children’s festival. “There are two reasons for that. One, the US still has a very active children’s library service, so a collective of easy-to-rouse gatekeepers. Two, the religious right remains very powerful, so fundamentalist Bible teaching is still brought into arguments.” More recently, says Eccleshare, the US has been very much on the “front foot in attacking anything that can be interpreted as cultural appropriation or cultural insensitivity. Most tragically, I think, Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House on the Prairie series has fallen from being a national treasure to being shunned, because of the Native Americans being described as frightening.” In the UK, she adds, “there are rarely these public ‘bans’, with the exception perhaps of the Little Black Sambo books, which were quite publicly removed from library shelves”. Back in 2003, the author Anne Fine tried to use her influence as children’s laureate to get Melvin Burgess’s young-adult novel Doing It junked by its publisher, on the grounds of obscenity, but only succeeded in increasing its sales. “Plenty of books go out of print because they are no longer politically acceptable, and we do quietly remove books,” says Eccleshare. “It’s usually to do with racism, because we have changed such a lot in how we think. Enid Blyton’s original Noddy stories vanished years ago, on account of their obvious racism. Similarly, Tintin in the Congo is only available now from very shady booksellers on the web.” The reasons for book banning have fluctuated over history, but fall roughly into three categories: religion, obscenity and political control. In 213BC, the Chinese emperor Qin Shi Huang buried 460 scholars alive and burned all the books in his kingdom so he could control how history would remember his reign (his distant successor Xi Jinping blocked the name Winnie-the-Pooh from social media sites after being compared to the tubby bear). The first list of books forbidden in Christianity was issued by the pope in the fifth century. And, in 1749, more than a century before the Obscene Publications Act was introduced in the UK, the writer John Cleland was charged with obscenity for Fanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, a pornographic moneyspinner he wrote while languishing in a debtor’s prison. DH Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover had been available in France and Italy for more than 30 years before it was published in the UK in 1960, whereupon its publisher, Penguin, was prosecuted. After a six-day trial at the Old Bailey, during which the book’s defenders included the novelist EM Forster and the critic Raymond Williams, the jury found Lady Chatterley’s Lover to be not obscene. On the first day it was available, a month later, all 200,000 copies sold. The Lady Chatterley case also demonstrates the international reach of censorship, with separate obscenity trials in Japan, Australia, Canada, India and the US (​​where it was exonerated along with Fanny Hill and Henry Miller’s Tropic of Cancer). But, it is in the political arena that book banning is now most toxic globally, with writers themselves under threat, in some parts of their world, along with their books. The UK is the refuge for two novelists banned from their homelands, who still write in their languages of origin. Hamid Ismailov won the EBRD literature prize in 2019 with The Devil’s Dance, the first Uzbek novel to be translated into English. Ismailov fled Uzbekistan in 1992 because of what the authoritarian state described as his “unacceptable democratic tendencies” and worked for the BBC for 25 years. The Devil’s Dance was smuggled into the country. “I’m the most widely published Uzbek, yet nobody can mention any of my books. Nobody can mention my name in any article, review [or] historic piece. It’s a total ban of my name, of activity, of books, of existence. It’s as if I’m nonexistent,” he has said. His most recent novel, Manaschi, offers a unique perspective on the colonisation by stealth of former parts of the Soviet empire by China – and also of the complex geopolitical legacy that has led to conflicts such as that playing out in Ukraine. “It’s a part of post-Soviet history that is unravelling. In the initial aftermath of the USSR breakup, many were surprised by how peacefully it happened – let’s say in comparison with the breakup of Yugoslavia,” he says. “But the Soviet Union left lots of knots, like the border issues, diasporas, ethnic minorities, mixed populations that are quite explosive in the framework of ethnic states, which inherited that legacy.” The writer Ma Jian has been in exile from mainland China since 1987, when he published a collection of short stories based on his travels in Tibet, which was immediately banned. Until 2008, he says, his novels were published in Hong Kong, but since then they have only been available in Taiwan. By the time he finished his most recent novel, 2018’s China Dream, even the underground bookshops in Hong Kong that had quietly imported his work had been shut down. “Every Hong Kong publisher I approached turned China Dream down. They said if they did publish it, they’d lose their jobs, and, anyway, there were no bookshops left in Hong Kong that would dare sell it.” Such international examples offer an ominous clue as to where the censorship surge in the US could lead, says Nossel. “In the 20th century, the South African apartheid state banned 12,000 books, at one point commandeering a steel factory furnace in order to burn reviled texts. And, in the 1930s, the Nazi party railed against ‘un-German books’, staging book burnings of Jewish, Marxist, pacifist and sexually explicit literature.” Legislation adopted in Hungary last year banned from schools all books referencing homosexuality, in the name of the “protection of children”. In 2014, Russia passed a law adding Nazi propaganda to the subjects it bans and restricts – “LGBT content, offences to traditional values, and criticisms of the state are among others,” says Nossel. “Booksellers were so fearful of running afoul of the broad law that they removed Spiegelman’s Maus from stores because of the swastika on the book’s cover, despite its potent anti-fascist message.” “This is a book about memory,” said Spiegelman at the time. “We don’t want cultures to erase memory, because then they just keep doing the same thing again and again.” The symmetry between Russia and the US is striking. As Oscar Wilde once wrote: “The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.”",Arts/Books,‘It’s a culture war that’s totally out of control’: the authors whose books are being banned in US schools,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/22/its-a-culture-war-thats-totally-out-of-control-the-authors-whose-books-are-being-banned-in-us-schools
3/22/2022,"Outside Lidl, Isabelle Martin, a childminder from a village in Creuse, in central France, was loading discounted eggs, sugar and milk into her car. With prices rising, the 55-year-old couldn’t stretch to a full trolley and could rarely afford to drive to Guéret, her nearest town. “I’m constantly thinking about my bank balance,” she said. At home she turned lights off and cut heating, and she never filled her car’s petrol tank completely “because the cost would be too much of a shock”. But it was when a young relative working as a rural healthcare assistant recently broke down and wept at the fuel pump because she could barely afford the petrol to get to work that Martin’s anger rose. “How can there not be a mood of revolt?” she asked. Worries about purchasing power and how to make ends meet have become French voters’ top concern before the April presidential election. The government says that, on paper, people have more in their wallets since Emmanuel Macron’s election in 2017. The treasury estimates that gross disposable income, which economists use as a gauge of purchasing power, has grown twice as fast under Macron than under his two predecessors, helped by tax cuts and job creation. But because food and fuel prices are rising, and because fixed costs such as housing, insurance, energy and phone bills account for such a large part of French budgets, voters feel a sense of daily struggle. An Ifop poll last month showed 69% of people felt their purchasing power had deteriorated over Macron’s term. Last week there was a national strike over wages and the blockade of fuel depots, with people in rural areas dependent on cars saying they were being hit hard. If Macron is re-elected next month – as polls suggest he will be – there are questions over whether he could face another form of social protest movement like the gilets jaunes demonstrations, which began over fuel taxes and living costs and morphed into a widespread anti-government revolt. Macron has said the fallout from the Ukraine war could drive inflationary pressures higher but he has promised to protect households. To cushion the impact of rising commodity prices and global oil markets before the election, the government has already introduced a raft of measures – capping gas and power price increases, giving one-off financial handouts to low-income households to cope with higher energy prices and inflation, and now a 15 cents-per-litre fuel discount. Martin said that although she received the government’s €100 payment to help with rising fuel prices in December, it was instantly “soaked up by bills”. Rural La Creuse is one of the poorest départements in France, with an ageing population, a shortage of doctors, and scant transport options other than cars. In Martin’s village of La Pionnat, with a population of 700 people, the long-term closure of a road has led to protests because it forces villagers to make a five-mile detour, and “that’s absolutely crippling us with fuel prices”, she said. On walls near Lidl in Guéret, posters for the hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who is rising in the polls, promised he would “block prices” for essential goods. Martin would vote for him. Her husband, Bruno, a self-employed mechanic, fears a high abstention rate. “The rich will all turn out to vote; the poor are so disgusted they don’t even vote,” he said. On the pavement outside the local prefect’s office, slogans had been spray-painted on the street. “Macron your people are starving,” said one. At a local fuel pump, Jean, 73, parked his Skoda. “Because pensions are so low I’ve got to keep working,” he said of his job in transport logistics. He voted for Macron in 2017 but won’t do so again. “We’re sleepwalking into a social crisis, salaries are low and people feel suffocated,” he said. It is uncertain who Macron will face in the final-round presidential vote on 24 April. The far-right Marine Le Pen is leading among a cluster of candidates. She has held ground against competition from the far-right TV pundit Eric Zemmour in part because she has focused on the cost of living and what she calls “the impoverishment of the population”. On a recent visit to a rural town, she said people were “having to choose between eating or heating”. She promised an extra €150-€200 a month for each household by cutting VAT on fuel and raising family tax credits. A key issue is salaries, particularly among essential caring professions, which are poorly paid and often involve travel over great distances. Pascaline Bon, 44, lives in a hamlet in La Creuse and is a school support worker for children with special needs. She went on strike last week over wages and demonstrated with her trade union, the SNUipp. “Around here, if I or my colleagues have to travel 25 to 35km to get to work then half of our salary is spent on diesel. We’re overdrawn by the fifth day of the month just to feed our children and pay bills.” Mathias Bernard, a political historian at the University of Clermont Auvergne, said the gilets jaunes protests had revealed the long-running struggle of people living on the periphery of towns or in rural areas, whose increased fuel and energy costs and stagnating salaries were tipping them into debt. He said: “The gilets jaunes – as a coordinated movement – have disappeared, but the factors that led to their protests have not gone away. The anger and potential for social protest among those on low and middle incomes is just as present today.” In Bordeaux, Anne Lauseig, 50, heads a collective of care assistants campaigning for better recognition and pay. She works nights assisting a young woman with disabilities. “We love the work we do,” she said. “But some of us can barely afford the petrol to travel to work. Some go to food banks or sleep in their cars if they can’t afford rent. I wait until the fridge is empty before I buy a little food. I’m not sure the government is aware of the anger and injustice people feel.”",News/World news,‘People feel suffocated’: cost of living tops French concerns before election,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/people-feel-suffocated-cost-of-living-tops-french-concerns-before-election

3/22/2022,"A group of people who survived or were bereaved by terrorist attacks is due to meet the home secretary on Tuesday to call for a state-funded support scheme. Brendan Cox, widower of the murdered MP Jo Cox and co-founder of the Survivors Against Terror (SAT), will tell Priti Patel that granting terror victims minimum guarantees of support should be a key part of the UK’s counter-terrorism strategy. Speaking to the Guardian before the meeting, he said: “Part of our way of saying ‘fuck you’ to terrorists is to show that survivors won’t be left to stew, but will be properly supported by the state.” He added: “Whenever a terror attacks happens, ministers get up and talk about how we will look after the survivors, but in reality that isn’t happening.” SAT will present Patel with a proposed terrorist survivors’ charter that guarantees them immediate financial support, rapid access to psychological support and a compensation fund. The eight-point charter also includes guaranteed legal support and a national memorial day for terrorist survivors. It was drawn up in consultation with SAT’s network of 300 people caught up in terrorist incidents including the Manchester Arena bombing, the Fishmonger’s Hall stabbings, and the London Bridge attack. Cox said it was vital that support was coordinated through a state-backed survivors’ hub or agency. He said: “This shouldn’t be left to the lottery of charity. The shift that we’re calling for is one where there are minimum legal rights. That needs to happen quickly, because we don’t want another generation of survivors to go through what the survivors of the Manchester attack or London Bridge attack had, which was just a completely inadequate.” He added: “There have been survivors who have contemplated suicide, and survivors who have ended up self harming because of that lack of support.” Cox said state systems for terror survivors in France and Belgium were currently putting the UK to “shame”. He said: “In the UK terror survivors are treated like the victims of a traffic accident, but in France and Belgium and some other countries, attacks on civilians are seen as proxy attacks on the state and therefore the state has a duty to look after them.” He pointed out that French citizens injured in the London Bridge attack opted to use the French government system because it is “more efficient and more generous”. In the wake of the Fishmonger’s Hall attack in November 2019, and days before the last election, Boris Johnson promised to consult on a survivors charter. Cox said SAT was determined to hold the government to that pledge. “Committing to a consultation isn’t the same as committing to bringing it in, so we are going to keep campaigning until we see the details,” he said. He said the proposed support hub would absorb the Home Office’s victims of terrorism unit. “We need a sort of survivors and victims champion, as opposed to something that just sits within government and does what it is told,” Cox said. In a statement the Home Office said: “We will continue to collaborate closely with Survivors Against Terror to ensure the Survivors Charter informs our review into the wider support package available to victims of terrorism and any subsequent recommendations of that review.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

3/22/2022,"A Conservative MP and former social care minister has signed up for a second job working as a director for a care home developer, just months after Boris Johnson promised a crackdown on outside earnings. Caroline Dinenage asked for formal approval to take up a job as a nonexecutive at LNT Group, a developer of new care homes owned by Tory donor Lawrence Tomlinson. Many of her party colleagues have been offloading second jobs following a furore about MPs spending too much time on outside interests after the Owen Paterson lobbying scandal that forced him to resign. The government pledged to bring in changes to the rules on MP jobs to tighten restrictions around lobbying and consultancy after a consultation held by the Commons standards committee, but last week No 10 quietly dropped support for capping hours and earnings. Despite the lack of formal new rules, many MPs have cut back their work for private companies. Julian Smith, a Conservative former cabinet minister, quit all of his private sector advisory roles, which had been earning him £144,000 a year, while Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, ended his advisory board role at Tunstall Healthcare, which had been earning him £20,000 a year. In contrast, Dinenage, the MP for Gosport, was given approval for the new part-time role at the care home developer earlier this month by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which noted that she had toured an LNT site while she was a social care minister but said her former department had no concerns about her taking up the job. It said she must not lobby the government on behalf of LNT, draw on privileged information, advise on government contracts or use contacts from her time in office. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “Just as Boris Johnson breaks his promise to crack down on Tory MPs’ outside work, it emerges one of his former health ministers has a second job with a care home firm. “This is a prime minister who has repeatedly allowed his own MPs to put their own private business interests ahead of their constituents and it must be stopped. Labour will set up a commission for integrity and ethics to make sure the British people’s interests always come first.” The government’s pledge last year to put tighter restrictions on second jobs came amid a public outcry over lobbying breaches by Paterson, whom MPs were initially whipped to try to protect, and a furore over the former attorney general Geoffrey Cox being paid nearly £6m as a lawyer since joining parliament, voting by proxy on days he was undertaking paid work. Two cabinet ministers, Dominic Raab and Anne-Marie Trevelyan, backed a time limit on second jobs last autumn, suggesting it could be 10 to 15 hours a week. But with pressure off Johnson’s premiership because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, ministers submitted their view to the Commons standards committee that a time limit or ceiling on such earnings would be “impractical”. At least 20 Conservative MPs have lobbied the standards committee investigating new rules on second jobs and their behaviour in the Commons chamber, with many saying they strongly disagreed with time limits on outside work. Dinenage has been contacted for comment.",News/Politics,Former minister takes second job as No 10 drops plan to cap MPs’ earnings,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/22/former-minister-takes-second-job-as-no-10-drops-plan-to-cap-mps-earnings
3/22/2022,"Even by Netflix true crime standards, Bad Vegan: Fame. Fraud. Fugitives stands out as bizarre and disconcerting. The four-part series from Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened director Chris Smith, released last week, details the confounding downfall of vegan chef Sarma Melngailis and her restaurant Pure Food and Wine, a buzzy Manhattan hotspot that was once on the forefront of the “raw food” movement and a celebrity magnet. Blonde and sylphic, Melngailis was the enviable face of a sleek, clean lifestyle; her two cookbooks from 2005 and 2009, which advertised raw-food recipes to “get the glow,” featured a picture of her on the cover looking coy and satisfied, the embodiment of the energy, clarity, and health that was the vegan way. But in 2011, Melngailis met a man online who, as the series outlines, cast a svengali-like spell over her and manipulated her into stealing money from investors and stiffing employees. By 2015, Melngailis disappeared from New York with her then-husband, Anthony Strangis, an inveterate gambler and reply-guy to Alec Baldwin’s tweets who had convinced Melngailis that if she passed a series of grueling emotional tests, including sexual degradation and giving him money, he would be able to make her and her beloved pit bull, Leon, immortal. According to the series, Melngailis’s debts totalled around $6m, including $400k bilked from her mother by Strangis. The couple was arrested in May 2016 at a motel outside Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Melngailis plead guilty to grand larceny, criminal tax fraud, and a scheme to defraud, and Strangis to four counts of fourth-degree grand larceny. Melngailis served a total of four months at Rikers Island, Strangis one year. The bare facts of the case really don’t do the strangeness of it justice, but it did make for instant tabloid fodder. An Ivy-educated, attractive vegan poster woman charged with stealing from employees, found on the run via a Domino’s Pizza order? The gossip press, which dubbed her the “vegan Bernie Madoff,” ate it up. Bad Vegan, for which Melngailis provided and in-depth interview and access to her vast archive of journals, text messages, emails and other communications with Strangis, attempts to set the sometimes inaccurate record straight and paint a fuller picture of Melngailis’s delusion and Strangis’s coercive control. “I definitely don’t think [Melngailis] would’ve been in this situation where she was convicted of fraud on her own,” Smith, also an executive producer on Tiger King, another Netflix true crime smash, told the Guardian of the project. “Had Anthony Strangis not entered her life, I definitely don’t see her going down this road. Over the course of four hours, Bad Vegan delves into Strangis’s contorted and, in recorded phone conversations, menacing manipulation of Melngailis, to increasingly baffling and illegible ends. (Strangis declined to participate in the series.) Over time, Strangis, who first met Melngailis under the Twitter pseudonym Shane Fox, convinced her that he was a special ops officer constantly under surveillance; that she should provide him access to her digital accounts for her own safety; that the money she gave him from her profitable business – ultimately millions of dollars – would eventually be returned; that a nebulous, semi-divine group called “The Family” would confer to her special powers and protection if she only proved herself worthy. That last point is significant, given that, as Melngailis explains in her interview, filmed over the course of eight hours in 2019, she was under a large amount of personal debt at the time she met Strangis and worried about maintaining her restaurant. Though the series features interviews with several former associates and friends of Melngailis – the “and” is common, as many former Pure Food and Wine staffers recount an admired boss known around her kitchen as “Sarmama” – the bulk of the series is built around Melngailis’s interview, which becomes more enigmatic and oblique the deeper she goes into the alternate reality. Melngailis often speaks dispassionately, as if in a trance; she relays what one can infer are traumatic experiences in passive tense, i.e. “whatever physical relationship that we had was not one that I wanted.” There’s a lot about her months on the run with Strangis that she either can’t discuss or can’t remember. According to her only post-Bad Vegan interview – with Vanity Fair’s Allen Salkin, who reported on the saga in 2016 and offers commentary in the series – Melngailis’s experience with dissociation and loss of memory feels akin to survivors of a cult. One’s display of emotion shouldn’t, of course, be the barometer of trustworthiness. But exactly how Strangis brainwashed Melngailis, if he did, remains unclear, and the internet is unforgiving. On Twitter, the general response to Bad Vegan has been a lack of sympathy for Melngailis, sometimes apologetically and often straight-up victim-blaming. On the heels of the Tinder Swindler, another massive Netflix true crime hit on a conman who bilked women for hundreds of thousands of dollars, there’s a general disbelief and scorn for women – in these cases, white women – who have given their money to a man. “It’s been hard to watch people react in the way they have,” said Ryann Fraser, an executive producer on Bad Vegan. “And I feel like more empathy would be a nice thing.” Melngailis, both in the series and now outside it, seems wary of the criticism. In a blog posted the day after the premiere, she wrote that there’s “a lot” that Bad Vegan “gets right,” but “it’s hard not to get stuck on the things that aren’t right or leave an inaccurate impression.” She called the portrayal of her marriage to Strangis in 2012 “inaccurately condensed” – the series leaves open the possibility that she married him for his (perceived) money, but Melngailis wrote she “didn’t want to marry him.” She expanded further in Vanity Fair: “The impression in the doc is I intentionally married Anthony so he could transfer me money. That is completely not the case. At some point, Anthony did some of his mindfuckery and got me to marry him.” Asked about her comments, Smith stood by the series. “I think it’s very clear in the series that there was a real connection between the two of them, in their communication online, in that she really did fall in love with him. In terms of their actual marriage, what she said to us is that she was asking the accountant how he could transfer this money to her, and he said ‘why don’t you get married,’ and she said 24 hours later, we went and got the certificate. That’s what we had to go off of based on the interview.” Melngailis also took issue with the final scene of the series, which plays an excerpt from a phone call with Strangis that sounds friendly in tone; she called the ending “disturbingly misleading,” as she was “not in touch with Anthony Strangis.” Smith said he was “confused” by this characterization, because the phone call occurred in August 2019, shortly before her master interview with the film-makers. “I’m unclear as to why that phone call is ‘disturbingly misleading,’” he said. Was the portrayal fair? “Look, everything is shades of grey,” he said. “We tried to represent it as accurately as we could from the information we had through the documentation that was presented to us and through the interview.” From Bad Vegan to Tinder Swindler and Smith’s own Fyre documentary, to scripted series on fraudsters such as Elizabeth Holmes (Hulu’s The Dropout) and Anna Delvey (Netflix’s Inventing Anna, another global hit), the level of scam content appears to have reached high tide – for now. “There’s something about seeing how these things are perpetrated and watching that unfold is fascinating,” Smith said of our evergreen fascination with stories of grift and deceit. “Part of it is trying to assess how you would react in a similar situation,” he added. “You hope people learn from these stories and can avoid similar situations for themselves.” That, at least, is one thing everyone seems to agree on – that somewhere in this confusing, messy, bizarre story is a lesson to be learned: on coercive control, or dissociation, or the yawning gap between public image and private turmoil, or the risk of Twitter reply-guys. “I’d be glad if my situation becomes a case study in all kinds of ways,” Melngailis told Vanity Fair. “I want this stuff to be useful, not merely fodder for people’s creepy entertainment.” Bad Vegan: Fame.

3/22/2022,"Many crimes have been committed in the name of paella but now researchers in Valencia have laid down 10 commandments of what thou shall and shall not put in their national dish. The ten permitted ingredients are: rice, water, olive oil, salt, saffron (or food colouring), tomato, flat green beans, lima beans, chicken and rabbit. No fish or shellfish. Ever. The research was carried out by social scientists at the Universidad Católica de Valencia at the instigation of local chef Rafael Vidal. The researchers questioned 400 amateur chefs aged over 50 from 266 Valencian villages. The results were published in the International Journal of Gastronomy and Science and were presented on Thursday at a meeting titled, A nightmare glocal discussion: what are the ingredients of paella valenciana? Ninety per cent of those interviewed agreed on the 10 essential ingredients, with some dissent over rabbit (88.9%). Paprika (62.5%) and rosemary (52.2%) are also considered acceptable, as are artichokes (46.3%), when in season. “Everyone has an opinion about paella but the idea was to do fieldwork to establish what are the essential ingredients,” says Pablo Vidal (no relation), an anthropologist at the university involved in the research. “What we have shown is what is always an ingredient of paella, what ingredients are sometimes used and what should never be used.” To people in Valencia, their version of paella is the version and nothing else is worthy of the name. Some will even argue that it can only be made from water from the region. If people in the rest of Spain want to add seafood, saudase or even black pudding, that’s their business, says Vidal, but in Valencian eyes, it’s not paella. The typical seafood paella encountered elsewhere in Spain is generally dismissed by valencianos as arroz con cosas (rice with things). “In Valencia everyone thinks their recipe is the best which is why we carried out this research, to try to arrive at a consensus,” he said. Last year the regional government declared Valencian paella a cultural asset. “Paella is an icon of the Mediterranean diet, because of both its ingredients and its characteristics as a representation of Valencian culture,” read the eight-page declaration which was published in Spain’s official state bulletin. The new study says that paella’s global popularity “is both a success and a challenge”. One such challenge was the outrage caused by the British chef Jamie Oliver’s recipe for paella with chorizo. “Oliver helped to provoke a discussion about what makes an authentic paella valenciana,” says Vidal. “I’m sure that one day he’ll have a street in Valencia named after him.” Like a barbecue, paella is a dish for social events that is usually prepared at the weekend or on holidays. However, it’s traditionally served in restaurants on Thursdays. There are various explanations for this. One is that Thursday was traditionally the cook’s day off so people tended to eat out. Another is that Francisco Franco was partial to paella and also liked to eat out on Thursday, so restaurants put it on the menu lest the dictator showed up for lunch. It’s also claimed that it was a way of using leftover fish and meat before the weekly shop on Friday. Vidal says there are as many recipes as there are cooks and what makes a good paella is a matter of opinion, except in Valencia, where it’s a question of science.",Lifestyle/Food,Researchers in Valencia pinpoint unwritten rules of paella,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/22/researchers-in-valencia-pinpoint-unwritten-rules-of-paella
3/22/2022,"Through sheer luck, I have been away on holiday while Dudley, Eunice and Franklin swept through, but in this calm after the storm, the effect they had on the River Wharfe is visible everywhere. Matted wads of grass, vegetation and detritus hang in branches like ragged nests, sometimes 10ft or so above the current level of the water. Parts of the bank have been scoured and disfigured; trees have toppled and snapped. A pair of grey wagtails flit across an alder that has crashed into the water, yellow plumage glinting brightly as they explore this altered component of their riparian world. River flooding is, of course, a natural process, and the life in and around rivers can adapt to, and sometimes even become intertwined with, the effects of deluges. In general, though, the increasing frequency and severity of floods is awful news for wildlife – wetlands suffocate, washed-away topsoil stifles the aquatic ecology, and invertebrate populations die as gravel beds are ripped out, providing less food for fish, and less prey for birds like the kingfisher. Upstream, I am startled to see the leathery carcass of a sheep dangling from a sycamore branch, suspended by its hind legs. It’s a pitiable sight, but it makes my thoughts journey upriver, to the landscape of heavily grazed sheep pastures and treeless moors which the Wharfe drains. The political dialogue around flooding often mistakenly – or cynically – counterposes the aims of conservation and flood prevention. But when looking at rivers as a whole, measures such as reforestation, moorland restoration and the reintroduction of “lost” species like beavers have all proven to be extremely beneficial for – among many other things – helping to control flood peaks. Hard flood defences have recently been built here in Otley, at a cost of £4m. They prevented local homes from being deluged in the recent storms, though the Wharfe burst its banks elsewhere. But more ambition is required to implement the natural remedies needed to rise to the challenges of this increasingly extreme era. Ambitious solutions have the potential to benefit everyone.

3/22/2022,"About an hour into its journey from Kunming to Gaungzhou, flight MU5735 fell out of the air. After cruising at an altitude of 29,100ft, it suddenly dropped to about 7,000ft where it briefly ascended before diving again and crashing into remote bamboo forest in the mountains near Wuzhou. The fall appears to have taken around two minutes, according to flight tracking data. “The plane did not smoke during the fall,” a witness told the Beijing Youth Daily. “The fire started after it fell into the mountain, followed by a lot of smoke.” Villagers reported the sound of explosions and a raging fire. Some locals raced to the scene ahead of hundreds of fire and rescue personnel – and reportedly local militia groups – travelling the final distance on foot via a dirt trail. There has been no official announcement on the death toll, but state media has reported there were no signs of survivors. Footage of the crash site showed a deep scar in the earth and indiscernible wreckage scattered across the area. A large piece of debris showed a partial sign of the China Eastern Airlines brand. The flight was carrying 132 people, including nine crew members. ID cards and wallets have reportedly been found at the scene but the plane’s black box has yet to be located and the cause of the crash is not yet known. However some details about those onboard have begun to come through as families gathered at the plane’s destination airport in Guangdong, and the airline’s office in Yunnan. According to local reports, a group of six were heading to Guangzhou for a funeral. A woman who gave a pseudonym Chen, told Jimu News the six included her sister and best friend. Another man, surnamed Yan, told Reuters a 29-year-old colleague was on the plane, and he was left to notify their mother. “When she picked up the phone, she choked up,” said Yan, adding that he had a “heavy heart” when he heard the news. Chinese media outlet The Paper reported another man, referred to as Liu Li, was on his way to Guangzhou from Kunming for a reunion with his family after they bought him a ticket. Another report described a young woman on her way to meet her fiance. “We couldn’t reach her,” her brother said. “She should have been arriving at Guangzhou after two hours. Her fiance is waiting for her at Guangzhou airport, he couldn’t find her or reach her.” Initial reports said there were 133 people aboard, a number which was later corrected after it emerged a passenger had cancelled their flight prior to boarding. Authorities have established a huge presence near the crash site, with multiple first responder groups, trauma specialists, psychologists, government emergency coordinators, and media. Live coverage by state media shows villagers on motorbikes carrying rescue workers and supplies up the mountain trail to the scene. The crash is China’s worst air disaster in at least a decade, and follows recent government praise for the industry’s vastly improved safety track record. The plane flying route MU5735 was not a Boeing 737 Max, which was grounded after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, but a Boeing 737-800, one of the world’s most common passenger planes. China Eastern Airlines has grounded all of that model in its fleet, as investigations continue. “Our thoughts are with the passengers and crew of China Eastern Airlines Flight MU 5735,” Boeing said in a statement. “We are working with our airline customer and are ready to support them.” CCTV footage from a nearby mine, shared online and verified by Jimu News and the Wall Street Journal, purports to capture the plane’s horrifyingly steep final descent, plunging at just 35 degrees off vertical. Aviation experts in the UK said there could be multiple reasons for the crash until further evidence emerged. Tony Cable, an air accident investigator, said possibilities included a “loss of control event” or high altitude stall. Crashes during the cruising period of a flight are rare. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, called for an all-out response and investigation. Hu Xijin, a former editor of the Global Times, China’s nationalistic tabloid, called for the company to keep people updated, perhaps referring to the public furore and eventual arrests after officials covered up the true extent of the death toll in last year’s Henan flood disaster. “Absolutely do not wait until the formal end of an investigation before notifying the public,” he said. The airline said there were no foreign nationals among the passengers. Authorities in Taiwan – which China claims as a province against its stated status as an independent nation – are working to determine if any of its citizens were onboard.
