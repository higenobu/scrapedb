2/16/2022,"A Hertz customer who was arrested aboard a cruise ship last week has become the latest customer to say the company falsely accused them of stealing one of its rental cars. Charles Doucette, a pharmacy and healthcare consultant from New Hampshire, said he was on a Caribbean cruise with his girlfriend when, back in a Florida port early Friday morning, police came to the door while the couple was sleeping. ""We opened it and it was security for the boat,"" he said. ""Customs and Border came onto the boat and told me to turn around, face the wall with my hands behind my back."" Doucette described the incident while sitting in Florida's Brevard County Jail, where he remained Tuesday. ""This is the most horrific experience of my life,"" he told CBS News' consumer investigative correspondent Anna Werner in a phone interview. Doucette is just the latest person saying Hertz filed a false police report against them. Bankruptcy court documents unsealed last week, after CBS News intervened in court, show the company filing thousands of police reports each year, roughly 8,000 every year for four years. Of those, documents from claimants say nearly 3,500 were filed against customers for what's called ""theft by conversion"", ""...that involve a renter who lawfully rented from Hertz..."" ""...and for which Hertz has payment information on file."" Doucette says he had rented a car from Hertz for his business last year, and properly extended the rental several times. But in March, police in Arizona stopped him and told him Hertz had filed a police report saying his rental car had been stolen. They towed the car, but Doucette says afterwards, Hertz charged his credit card the full amount for the rental. Yet in August, prosecutors who say they were acting on Hertz's police report, took his case to a grand jury and indicted him. Facing a required court appearance in Arizona, Doucette said, he contacted a local attorney there and sent notarized documents so he wouldn't have to appear in person. It's not clear what occurred in the local court, but he was arrested Friday. ""I am one of their best customers. And here I am sitting in jail,"" Doucette said. ""It's just completely absurd that any company would allow something to affect somebody's life,"" he said. Doucette said he's been an elite President's Circle member who spent over $15,000 with Hertz in 2020 and 2021. ""I'm sitting here for three days. Tell me that you're treating your customers right,"" Doucette said. His girlfriend of 18 years, who didn't want to be identified because of her job, said he is not doing well ""at all."" ""I just want him home,"" she said. ""I just want answers, so that we can pick up the pieces and move on."" Hertz said in a statement that ""situations where vehicles are reported to the authorities are very rare and happen only after exhaustive attempts to reach the customer."" The company did not respond to questions about Doucette's case. Attorney Francis Alexander Malofiy represents Doucette and other claimants.  ""Hertz refuses to correct a police report when they've learned payments [were] made, when they've learned the car's been returned or when they've learned there's inaccuracies,"" he said. Malofiy sent a letter to the company over the weekend, asking Hertz to help get Doucette out of jail. He said unless something changes, Doucette will be in jail for a minimum of 10 days because he is awaiting extradition to Arizona. ""I always thought that [the] world we live in is, 'innocent until proven guilty,'"" Doucette said. ""This is, 'guilty until proven innocent.'""

2/16/2022,"By Leah Douglas Feb 14 (Reuters) - Corn-based ethanol, which for years has been mixed in huge quantities into gasoline sold at U.S. pumps, is likely a much bigger contributor to global warming than straight gasoline, according to a study published Monday. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, contradicts previous research commissioned by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) showing ethanol and other biofuels to be relatively green. President Joe Biden's administration is reviewing policies on biofuels as part of a broader effort to decarbonize the U.S. economy by 2050 to fight climate change. “Corn ethanol is not a climate-friendly fuel,” said Dr. Tyler Lark, assistant scientist at University of Wisconsin-Madison Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment and lead author of the study. The research, which was funded in part by the National Wildlife Federation and U.S. Department of Energy, found that ethanol is likely at least 24% more carbon-intensive than gasoline due to emissions resulting from land use changes to grow corn, along with processing and combustion. Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, the ethanol trade lobby, called the study ""completely fictional and erroneous,"" arguing the authors used ""worst-case assumptions cherry-picked data."" Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a law enacted in 2005, the nation's oil refiners are required to mix some 15 billion gallons of corn-based ethanol into the nation's gasoline annually. The policy was intended to reduce emissions, support farmers, and cut U.S. dependence on energy imports. As a result of the mandate, corn cultivation grew 8.7% and expanded into 6.9 million additional acres of land between 2008 and 2016, the study found. That led to widespread changes in land use, including the tilling of cropland that would otherwise have been retired or enrolled in conservation programs and the planting of existing cropland with more corn, the study found. Tilling fields releases carbon stored in soil, while other farming activities, like applying nitrogen fertilizers, also produce emissions. A 2019 study https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17597269.2018.1546488 from the USDA, which has been broadly cited by the biofuel industry, found that ethanol’s carbon intensity was 39% lower than gasoline, in part because of carbon sequestration associated with planting new cropland. But that research underestimated the emissions impact of land conversion, Lark said. USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the nation's biofuel policy, is considering changes to the program. Under the RFS, Congress set blending requirements through 2022, but not beyond, giving the EPA authority to impose reforms.

2/16/2022,"Twitter critics roundly mocked accounting firm Mazars USA on Monday for finally getting a clue that the Trump Organization’s financial statements were unreliable — after preparing them for a decade. Mazars informed the Trump Organization in a letter that it was cutting ties, noting that the financial statements it had prepared with information provided by the company between mid-2011 and June 2020 “should no longer be relied upon.” The letter also said Mazars reconsidered its work just last month after questions were raised in a court filing by New York Attorney General Letitia James. She’s investigating whether Trump assets were inflated in order to secure loans. Twitter critics weren’t buying Mazars’ sudden epiphany about the Trump information, and accused the firm of trying to get out the line of investigative fire: This is a BFDTrump’s accounting firm Mazars just fired him and said that a decade of his financial statements “can no longer be relied upon”They implied that Trump lied to them for 10 yearsWe all know Trump is a pathological liar but Mazars should be held accountable too — Lindy Li (@lindyli) February 14, 2022 No sympathy for #Mazars.

2/16/2022,"Tuberville, a Republican from Alabama, had heavily invested in Alibaba Group. A congressional financial disclosure indicates Tuberville has ""divested"" of Alibaba. Lawmakers are debating whether to ban themselves from trading stocks at all. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, one of Congress' most vocal critics of China, has quietly dumped his investments in an e-commerce and technology company with ties to the country's Communist Party.

The Alabama Republican on January 14 executed three stock option trades, valued at between $80,003 and $200,000, that ended his investment in Alibaba Group, according to a disclosure he submitted to the US Senate on February 14. ""This transaction is called buying to cover, which is a way to close out a short sale. Per this transaction, the senator is divested of BABA securities,"" states Tuberville's filing, which references Alibaba's stock ticker symbol. When asked Tuesday at the US Capitol to confirm he will no longer trade Alibaba stock, Tuberville told Insider: ""Yeah — I'm not going to buy. No, I'm not buying it."" Tuberville's divestiture comes at a moment when Congress is debating whether to ban lawmakers — and potentially their spouses — from buying and selling individual stocks altogether. And the debate follows publication of Insider's ""Conflicted Congress"" project, which found that 56 members of Congress, including Tuberville, and at least 182 senior congressional aides, have in recent months violated the federal Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012 with late or missing stock disclosures. Tuberville's STOCK Act violations are among the largest in Congress when measured by dollar value and number of associated stock trades. ""Conflicted Congress"" also found dozens of examples of members of Congress holding stock in companies that clash with their public responsibilities or stated orthodoxies or sat on committees that directly oversee the activities of companies in which they hold shares. Since arriving in Washington in 2021, Tuberville has established himself as one of Congress' most vocal critics of China's government. The former college football coach even introduced a bill that would ban the federal government's Thrift Savings Fund from investing in the stocks of companies based in China. ""We don't want to invest that money in Chinese companies to prop up the Chinese,"" Tuberville said in May on Fox Business Network. But Tuberville's public statements about China contrasted with his decision to personally invest in Alibaba. In 2019 Reuters reported that Alibaba had developed a propaganda app for China's government. Jack Ma, Alibaba's founder and former chairman, is also a member of the Chinese Communist Party, reports said. Tuberville's office told Insider in June 2021 that the senator has financial advisors who ""actively manage his portfolio,"" and that the senator no longer owned Alibaba stock after holding it the year before. ""In early 2020, upon becoming aware of the Alibaba investment, which was less than $5,000, he instructed his advisors to divest in the stock,"" spokesperson Ryann DuRant said at the time. ""The candidate report reflects that divestment in that stock, which took place on June 1, 2020."" But Tuberville continued to buy and sell hundreds of thousands of dollars of Alibaba stock or stock options in 2021, according to federal financial filings. And while Tuberville has rid himself of his Alibaba investment, he continues to actively trade stocks. In January, he purchased shares in pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc., oil giant Chevron Corporation, and Verizon Communications Inc., among others. He also sold stock shares in numerous companies, including tobacco firm Philip Morris International and defense contractors Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Technologies Corp., according a congressional filing on February 14. Tuberville has been critical of the increasingly bipartisan push to ban members of Congress from trading stocks, calling the idea ""ridiculous."" ""They might as well start sending robots up here,"" Tuberville told The Independent's Eric Michael Garcia. ""You can't do anything."" ""I think it would really cut back on the amount of people that would want to come up here and serve, I really do,"" Tuberville added. ""We don't need that."" Other members of Congress have recently made voluntary moves to distance themselves from risk — be it legal or reputational — associated with their stock trades. Republican Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas this month confirmed to Insider that he will place his stock assets in a Congress-approved qualified blind trust after having racked up STOCK Act violations. Democratic Rep. Peter Welch of Vermont, meanwhile, said he and his wife will no longer own individual stock. Welch's decision came after Insider reported that Welch was tardy in disclosing that his wife in September sold thousands of dollars of ExxonMobil shares. Welch ultimately disclosed the sale several days after grilling ExxonMobil's CEO at a congressional oversight hearing. Read the original article on Business Insider",Business/INSIDER,"Republican Sen.

2/16/2022,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — An Ohio father can fight the adoption of the children whose mother he killed, after a divided state Supreme Court said there was a good reason he hadn't been in touch with them since the slaying: He was following a judge's order not to contact them. Under Ohio law, parental consent is not required for adoptions if proof exists that a parent had little or no contact with the child for at least one year before the filing of adoption papers. In the current case, the father had previously lost his attempts to block the adoption of his daughters by the girls’ maternal grandparents, who took custody of the children after their mother was killed. An appeals court agreed the father couldn’t use his imprisonment to justify his failure to contact the children, since his actions led to the prison sentence. Then in 2019, the state Supreme Court ruled in a different case that a woman couldn't stop the father of their child, who was not paying child support, from objecting to the child's adoption by her new husband. The reason: The father was following a court order that eliminated his responsibility for support payments, an order requested by the mother. “Every day, families rely on court orders to define parents’ lawful obligations,” said Justice Sharon Kennedy in the majority opinion in that 2019 case. “Our decision today ensures that the judgment of the court with the jurisdiction to set child-support levels can be relied upon.” Based on that 2019 decision, the man who killed his wife petitioned for a new hearing, and the 8th Ohio District Court of Appeals ruled in his favor. The grandparents appealed, and the state Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Court records, which do not identify any of the parties, indicate the killing happened in Summit County in 2006, after which the man was sentenced to 23 years to life. He remains in prison, said his attorney, Mary Catherine Barrett. Because, by following a court order, a parent is prohibited from staying in contact with children, “a probate court should not dispense with the requirement of a parent’s consent,” Justice Melody Stewart wrote Feb. 10 for the 4-3 majority in the current case. Justice Patrick DeWine ruled in favor of requiring the father's consent, but said Stewart's opinion went too far in making a no-contact order a justifiable excuse for not being involved with the children ahead of an adoption request. What if a parent was following a no-contact order, but also made it clear they wanted nothing to do with the child, DeWine asked. “Should the parent be able to object to the adoption simply because he or she is subject to a no-contact order, when the evidence suggests that the order is not the reason for the lack of contact?” DeWine said. Kennedy dissented in this case, saying the 2019 ruling involved a different set of facts. The previous lower court rulings blocking the imprisoned father's consent should have stayed in place, she said. The majority opinion ""creates an unacceptable consequence for the children in this case: an inability to enjoy their right to an intact childhood and a loving adoptive family,"" Kennedy wrote. The father fought the adoption mainly to preserve the ability of his own mother and other family members to keep in contact with his two daughters, not to disrupt the girls' situation with their maternal grandparents, Barrett said. One girl has since turned 18, but another is still a minor, she said. “The only thing this case affects is whether the other grandmother has the right to visit,” Barrett said. The girls' maternal grandparents are saddened by the ruling, said Rebecca Clark, the grandparents’ attorney. The couple only initiated adoption proceedings because it would have allowed them to seek out more robust educational opportunities for the girls, both of whom are severely autistic and will never live on their own, Clark said. “My clients would never have moved for adoption for any other reason,” she said.",U.S./Associated Press,Court: Dad can fight adoption of kids whose mother he killed,https://news.yahoo.com/court-dad-fight-adoption-kids-150000030.html
