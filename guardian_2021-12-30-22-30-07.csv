12/30/2021,"A soldier on a patrol march stepped on a child who fell under their feet at the Tower of London. The incident involving a Coldstream Guard, a division with a ceremonial role of providing protection for Royal palaces and known for their no-nonsense approach to tourists, was filmed and has been widely shared.  A spokesperson for the army said the public had been warned a patrol was approaching, adding that the soldier checked on the child afterwards and was reassured they were not injured. The footage shows two guards on patrol when a young girl falls under their path and does not move in time as the soldier walks over her without looking back. In the video, a cry can be heard before the collision. After a video was posted on TikTok of a Queen’s Guard soldier stamping his foot on a small child whilst marching at the Tower of London, a UK @DefenceHQ spokesperson claims that, following the incident, “the soldier checked on the child and was reassured that all was well.” pic.twitter.com/bYmZsrMDqD An Army spokesperson said: “We are aware of an incident at the Tower of London earlier today during a routine patrol. “The Guardsman on duty warned members of the public that a patrol was approaching, but the child unfortunately ran out in front of the soldier unexpectedly. “The soldier tried to step over the child and continued on his duty. “Following the incident, the soldier checked on the child and was reassured that all was well.” The incident has prompted a mixed reaction, however, with somecriticising the soldiers actions and others arguing that the child was unharmed and should not have been in their way. The Coldstream Guards is the oldest continuously serving regular regiment in the British army. One of its principal roles is the protection of the monarchy so it often participates in state ceremonial occasions.

12/30/2021,"The Ashes series continues to grapple with Covid-19 after match referee David Boon tested positive for the virus and Australia and England were placed on separate flights to Sydney due to the growing outbreak among the tourists. The news on Thursday that Chris Silverwood, England’s head coach, is expected to miss the fourth Test at the SCG that starts on 5 January due to a family member testing positive – the seventh case among support staff and families since Boxing Day – was followed by Boon also having to stay back in Melbourne for 10 days of isolation.  Cricket Australia (CA) confirmed Boon is fully vaccinated, including a booster, and asymptomatic, so will return for the fifth Test in Hobart, with Steve Bernard, on the ICC referees list and based in New South Wales, set to deputise. However, the governing body is clearly scrambling to keep the series going amid England’s outbreak. The tourists were awaiting results from a fourth round of testing on Thursday before their flight to Sydney on New Year’s Eve and a separate charter for Australia’s touring party had been organised at short notice. Both teams are set to stay at the same hotel in Sydney but their journey has been split to reduce contact time. Graham Thorpe, the assistant coach, is leading the England squad in an interim capacity provided he himself clears the latest PCR tests. Silverwood intends to serve 10 days of isolation to ensure his family’s wellbeing in Melbourne, but could in theory travel to Sydney after seven and thus in time for day two of the fourth Test. “It’s not ideal but it’s been that sort of tour,” said Jimmy Anderson, responding to Silverwood’s news. “Something has been happening all the time. Lots of stuff away from the cricket which can cause distractions, so it’s something we have to deal with.” England’s players have had meetings about learning to cope with Covid outbreaks on tour, something which helped the third Test continue to its conclusion after the camp’s first four cases came to light on the second morning of the match. By contrast, Thursday night’s fixture between Perth Scorchers and Melbourne Stars in Melbourne became the first Big Bash League match to be postponed since the start of the pandemic after the emergence of one positive case in the Stars’ backroom staff. CA told the Guardian the two situations differed due to the number of players that the Stars’ coach had close contact with before the positive result and the delay for PCR test results. England’s players and coaches mixed over the Christmas period and on day one at the MCG but only lateral flow results were required to take the field.",Sport/Sport,Cricket Australia scrambling to keep Ashes on track amid Covid outbreak,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/30/cricket-australia-scrambling-to-keep-ashes-on-track-amid-covid-outbreak
12/30/2021,"Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes were even worse than those of the sexual predator for whom she trafficked girls because she used her ability to gain the girls’ confidence to drag them into a world of abuse, an alleged victim has said. Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Maxwell’s boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein, but who did not give testimony in the case that concluded on Wednesday, said Maxwell and Epstein had taken a part of her childhood that she could never get back.  “I have been dreaming of this day for the last 10 years, not knowing that it was going to come,” she told New York magazine’s the Cut. “It’s a bittersweet emotion because I have been fighting for so long.” Maxwell was convicted on sex trafficking charges that carry a total prison sentence of as much as 65 years. Epstein, the convicted child sexual abuser on whose behalf she acted, killed himself in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on allegations of sexual offences against hundreds of girls. Giuffre said part of the pattern of the abuse perpetrated by Epstein and Maxwell was the mix of charm and power they could wield. Epstein had powerful friends – such as Prince Andrew, whom she also accuses of sexual abuse – and could convince girls he “owned” the local police department, she said. But Maxwell was capable of exploiting their weaknesses to draw them in. She said Maxwell gained her confidence by promising to help her achieve her dream of becoming a massage therapist if she came to work for Epstein. Instead, she said, it was the start of her ordeal at his hands. She told the Cut that Maxwell used her “womanly abilities to make me feel comfortable”, adding: “The deceit hurts even more because I fell naively into her trap. I mean, she is poised. She looks sophisticated. She didn’t raise any hairs on the back of my head.” Giuffre said Maxwell had seen her reading a book about massage therapy and, armed with that knowledge, was able to gain her confidence. “The thing about predators is they seek the vulnerable, find out what they want, and promise them a dream. That’s how they work. Cages and chains come in all different shapes and sizes. I wasn’t tied to a radiator or anything, like you’ve seen in movies. My shackles were Epstein and Ghislaine’s wealth and the powerful people they knew.” She called Maxwell the “devil’s righthand man”, adding: “She’s definitely worse than Epstein. She used that charm, that wit, that smile to come off as somebody you want to trust … She’s worse to me, more evil than Epstein. What Ghislaine did to so many of us, it’s unforgivable.” Wednesday’s guilty verdicts showed that “no matter how rich or how connected you are, you can still be held accountable,” she said. A lawyer representing 20 people who have accused Epstein and Maxwell said the verdicts were a warning to sexual predators that their crimes would be punished. “This does send a message to other sex predators and those who would conspire to sex-traffic underage girls to them that this will be taken very seriously, charges may be filed against you, you may be prosecuted and you may end up getting sentenced to prison for the rest of your life, as may be the case with Miss Maxwell,” Gloria Allred told BBC Breakfast on Thursday. “Beware and do not conspire with or become a sexual predator yourself, because underage girls are very vulnerable. They are easy to take advantage of and it is taken very seriously when they are preyed upon by adults who do know better.” The Duke of York, the Queen’s second son, is facing a civil lawsuit brought by Giuffre in the US over claims – which he vehemently denies – that he had sex with her when she had been sexually trafficked by Epstein as a 17-year-old. Allred said it was now a matter of having to “wait and see” whether the case gets to trial. Lisa Bloom, a US lawyer who also represents several of Epstein’s survivors, said Andrew should be “quaking in his boots” after Wednesday’s verdicts. She told Mail Online: “Because this shows that a jury is willing to come back with a guilty verdict even if the accusers are not perfect, as no human being is. Even if there were grounds for cross-examination, which there were, they looked to the essence of the story and they found that Ghislaine Maxwell was guilty of sex trafficking.”",News/US news,"Ghislaine Maxwell more evil than Epstein, says Virginia Giuffre",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/ghislaine-maxwell-more-evil-than-epstein-says-virginia-giuffre
12/30/2021,"At least three members of a Saudi hit squad convicted by the kingdom of murdering Jamal Khashoggi are living and working “in seven-star accommodation” inside a government-run security compound in Riyadh, according to a source connected to senior members of Saudi intelligence. The assassins are believed to be staying in villas and buildings run by Saudi Arabia’s State Security agency – far from the walls of its infamous prisons. The source has spoken to two witnesses who claim to have seen the men. They said family members frequently visit the men, who are able to use a gym and workspaces on the site.  All were sentenced before a Saudi court, in a trial broadly condemned as a sham – though only one of them, Salah al-Tubaigy – was named. Some received death sentences, which were later commuted to life terms. The sightings cast further doubt on Riyadh’s claims to be holding the killers to account and come as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s most trusted adviser, Saud al-Qahtani has re-emerged in the royal court after three years in hiding. Qahtani was acquitted of any involvement, despite a western intelligence assessment that he had masterminded the assassination at Prince Mohammed’s behest. The source confirmed that Tubaigy, the forensic scientist who dismembered Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, was one of those seen inside the facility. Mustafa al-Madani, the body double dispatched by the hit squad team to create the ruse that Khashoggi left the consulate alive, has also been seen, as has Mansour Abahussein, who is accused of leading the operation. Both witnesses have visited the compound on several occasions in the past two years. They say the men were relaxed and appeared to be performing normal duties. Visitors, including caterers, gardeners, technicians and family members, frequently attend the compound, according to the intelligence source. The sightings of Tubaigy, Abahussein and Madani took place in late 2019 and towards the middle of 2020. The witnesses would not publicly disclose their names for fear of retribution from Prince Mohammed and by state security, which wields a heavy hand in Saudi Arabia. Abahussein and Madani are known to be intelligence officers employed by state security. Their boss, Abdul Aziz bin Mohammed Al-Howairini, has been seen with some of the accused, and is often spotted using the compound gym. In December 2019, after proceedings shrouded in secrecy, a Saudi court acquitted three defendants; sentenced five more to death; and a further five to prison terms. The five men sentenced to death were not organisers and were eventually legally pardoned in May 2020 by Khashoggi’s children in an arrangement brokered by Prince Mohammed. Little has been revealed, until now, about the whereabouts of the main players in the plot. But their apparent presence in a modern, well-equipped intelligence compound, where they enjoy freedom of movement, is starkly at odds with assurances by the Saudi royal court that the perpetrators faced tough punishment. The revelations come as mystery continues to surround the identity of a man arrested by French police this month, who was initially identified as a member of a secondary team of the Khashoggi assassins. Khaled Aedh al-Otaibi was arrested at Charles de Gaulle airport on 7 December on the basis of a warrant issued by Turkey. Police later said the arrest had been a case of mistaken identity. However, Turkish officials are understood to believe that France may have captured the right man and freed him for political reasons. A well-placed source confirmed to the Guardian that Turkish officials had flagged their concerns, claiming the data they provided to Interpol matched what French police had initially sent to them. Prince Mohammed is known to be anxious to prevent further details of the assassination being made public – a scenario that would have been likely if one of the killers had been extradited to Turkey and tried in open court. President Emmanuel Macron of France was received by Prince Mohammed in Jeddah earlier this month in the first visit by a western leader to Saudi Arabia since the scandal erupted in October 2018. As a quid pro quo, Macron had insisted that the de facto Saudi leader receive a call from the Lebanese prime minister, Najib Mikati, potentially opening a path for Riyadh to send aid to the bankrupt country. In the days that followed France releasing the man they arrested, the language used by Saudi and Gulf officials towards Lebanon has softened considerably.",News/World news,"Jamal Khashoggi killers living in luxury villas in Riyadh, say witnesses ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/jamal-khashoggi-killers-living-in-luxury-villas-in-riyadh-say-witnesses
12/30/2021,"A series of major storms have doused the parched landscapes of the American west with rain and record-breaking amounts of snow over the past two weeks, offering a hopeful reprieve after a devastatingly dry year. In California, which has been mired in drought, the snowpack has grown to 159% of what’s considered normal for this time of year, and the state got to more than half of its 1 April average, with some areas receiving more than 122in of snow over the last seven days. It’s not just in the mountains. Rainfall records have been broken across the state, and southern California is bracing for floods, flows, and more frigid temperatures through the end of the week.  NEW DECEMBER RECORD: 193.7""With a 24 hour official #snow total of 38.9"" at the lab, we have smashed the previous record of 179"" of snow in December set in 1970!Snow rates are still heavy and we could even break the 200"" mark today!#CAwx #CAwater pic.twitter.com/x9g6fRuzHQ But still – the drought remains. Despite what officials and experts are calling a promising start to the water year (which is measured starting each October) there’s a long way to go before California overcomes deficits left by dry conditions. The most recent report from the US Drought Monitor, released 23 December, shows that close to 80% of the California is still classified in extreme drought. Just under a quarter of the state is cast in exceptional drought – the highest category. “This drought has been a very severe drought so the water deficits have been severe,” says Noah Diffenbaugh a climate scientist at Stanford University. He likens the storms to an overdue check received after months without pay. “If you don’t get paid for weeks or months on end and then you get a regular paycheck that doesn’t make up for everything you’ve lost out on.” Ernest Conant, Regional Director for the California-Great Basin at the US Bureau of Reclamation agrees. “The main takeaway is this is a great start but certainly the drought is not over,” he says. “The snowpack is our largest reservoir in the state,” he adds. “Last year, we started out with a pretty good snowpack in January and then nothing further happened. That’s a good illustration of what we don’t like to see – just one big storm and that was it.” Most reservoirs in the state remain lower than average. Shasta, California’s largest – and a cornerstone of the Central Valley Project, which supplies water to the agricultural center of the state – is still at just 29% of its total capacity, about half of where it historically is at this time of year. Three reservoirs, out of 12 total in the state, have surpassed their historical averages, including Folsom near Sacramento, where officials have had to discharge water due to flood risks. “They all have to preserve a certain amount of space for flood control and of course Folsom is critical for flood control protection for the greater Sacramento area,” Conant says. “But most of the state’s reservoirs still have a long way to go.” In order to get the water supply to a safer and more sustainable level, a strong snowpack will be essential. Roughly 90% of California’s rain and snowfall happens between October and April – with most of it falling during the winter months – which makes the season a crucial time for determining how the state will fare through the summer. The snowpack is especially important, providing what amounts to a water savings account that will trickle into streams, rivers and reservoirs through the warmer seasons. 22 inches of snow in just the last 12 hours at @TahoeXC near lake level. Just an epic dump for the Tahoe region and the Sierra. @TahoeWeather @NWSReno #CAwx pic.twitter.com/QgHPwcHVjj With the possibility of warm, dry weather lurking in the coming months, it’s still unclear whether the snowpack will stick around until spring. Higher temperatures and warm rainstorms can eat away at the snow, cutting into California’s most important water supply system. “In the west we have been experiencing decreasing reliability on the snowpack as a result of long term warming,” Diffenbaugh says. “We have experienced in recent years, very rapid spring snowmelt, even in years when there has been substantial snowpack.” Heat, which is attributable to human-caused climate change, not only has a negative impact on the snowpack, it has also played a big role in intensifying the drought conditions across the American west, baking moisture out of the air while it increases water needs among plants, animals, and people. It has also had a hand in expanding the risks from drought-related events, like fast-moving wildfires. “There’s been a lot of research on how global warming is affecting the hydroclimate of California and the west more broadly,” Diffenbaugh says. “Even going back to the 80s we can find research showing that warming is decreasing the reliability of the snowpack, increasing runoff and flood risk during the wet season in California, and increase moisture deficits and droughts in the warm season.”",News/US news,Record snowfall offers reprieve to dry California – but the drought remains,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/california-record-snowfall-drought
12/30/2021,"Gyms are temples for the terminally vain to worship their own bodies and set fire to their cash. If you want to self-improve, read a book: and why, given the limited time slot granted to each of us to be alive, waste so much time in self-indulgent solitude? More sinister than that, gyms prey on insecurities fostered by a popular culture that worships unrealistic physical types: and as a gay man, I belong to a community in which body dysmorphia struts around the dancefloor with gleeful abandon. That used to be what I thought, anyway, and even when I surrendered to gym membership, I felt like a tone-deaf singer signing up for a choir. Everyone else seemed to know what they were doing, flexing with free weights in all sorts of unlikely poses while I sheepishly faffed around with the treadmill and aimlessly tried the occasional weight machine hoping that grunting a lot was some sort of sign of progress. (It’s reassuring to know this did not make me exceptional: research suggests more than half of us don’t know what to do in the gym.)  This year, I changed my mind for a few reasons. First, I’d put on weight during lockdown – like most Britons, who on average added half a stone – in large part because, like one in three British adults, my drinking went up. Lockdown boredom, the stress of writing a book, and politics increasingly resembling a burning skip did not help. Second, I didn’t want to remember this unsettling era as a miserable life-devouring black hole: better to be able to say that at least it spurred a positive change. Third, I was still reeling from turning 37 and the realisation that, “Oh, so you really do just hurtle through life, and without making changes, your health faces a downhill slope.” Beginning more than two months before gyms reopened on 12 April, I drastically cut down on drink, combined running with high-intensity interval training – that’s where you do start/stop bursts of vigorous exercise – and ate a lot of Greek yoghurt. This approach is not for everyone, and, with hindsight, was something of an error: losing weight fast is liable to reduce body fat and muscle at the same time. So, not long after the gyms reopened, I decided to focus on building muscle for a few reasons, none of them to do with becoming the Arnold Schwarzenegger of the left. It’s good for health, and research even suggests it’s good for brain function. It reduces stress and improves emotional wellbeing, powering up endorphins on a search-and-destroy mission to take out bad thoughts. When I’m working out, I have to concentrate – not something that comes easily in my case – so I can forget all the people who’ve loudly decided I’m the socialist Antichrist on Twitter. There’s the satisfaction of learning and mastering new skills – particularly those you always believed you were simply hardwired to never acquire. Everyday physical tasks become easier, turning you into a more helpful resource. You lay a healthy foundation for later years to build on. It’s undeniably rewarding, too, to put significant effort into something and see results, even if that can be construed as vanity. Here is a far healthier alternative to the scams that are diets, too, the vast majority of which eventually end with the dieter putting on more weight than they started with. Indeed, I’ve been forced to learn far more about food and how the body works. Rather than seeing carbohydrates as inherently bad, to be labelled “strong avoid”, I’ve come to understand good carbs – such as oats, wholemeal bread, vegetables and whole fruits – as a source of fuel, so that protein can be used to build muscle rather than broken down inefficiently as energy. I now eat more than ever, just more mindfully about what the body deems more helpful. That matters because a balanced diet is much more important than flexing your guns in the local gym. Above all, it’s been educational. Rather than haphazardly using whichever machine looks least intimidating, I searched the internet to adopt a regimen that works different muscle groups on different days. Thanks to YouTube, a friend, and a brilliant personal trainer called Nathan once a week, I learned the proper form for each exercise – important if you want to avoid injury. And so, aged 37, I’m the healthiest I’ve ever been. So many caveats need to be applied here. This is easy to do if you have no kids, live next to a gym you can afford to join, and have a work life you can flexibly juggle. I haven’t changed my mind about the evils of body dysmorphia, and the importance of embracing the different ways our bodies manifest. And while the market size of the gym and fitness sector in the UK nearly doubled to more than £2bn in the 2010s, for many, membership doesn’t mean much other than feeling better for having done something. In the US, less than one-fifth of gym members use their paid-for facilities consistently. Like anything, the gym needs commitment, being comfortable with the trial and error that forms the basis of education, and building up new skills. But in my case, it’s worked, improved both my physical and mental health, and made life more satisfying: so here’s to changing my mind.

12/30/2021,"A leading scientist has warned it is “very worrying” that a shortage of Covid-19 tests could lead to people mixing for new year celebrations without being able to see whether they are infectious. Prof Peter Openshaw, who sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the conditions at a New Year’s Eve gathering were “perfect” for spreading coronavirus.  Asked about the prospect of untested people mixing due to a shortage of lateral flow devices, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think it’s very worrying indeed. “We know the situations in which transmission happens and fortunately I don’t think we are facing the sort of lockdown that was necessary in order to cope in the very earliest part of this year. “But we do know that crowding together in poorly ventilated spaces, particularly if you are shouting over loud music, is absolutely perfect in terms of transmitting this very, very highly transmissible virus.” An error message on the government’s lateral flow test ordering website that appeared for several hours on Thursday said there were “no home delivery slots left”. For a time, there were also no PCR home tests available for either essential workers or the wider public, nor slots at walk-through and drive-in testing sites across England. The issue led Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, to accuse the government of sending “mixed messages” about the reason for the shortage. He said: “The government advice is reasonably clear about what people need to do before they’re allowed to socialise, before they’re allowed to release after self-isolation, but there’s no point in having that advice if as GPs we know we’re no longer able to help patients to actually act on that advice, and that’s a big issue for us.” Prof Azeem Majeed, head of the department of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, also said there were not enough lateral flow tests to support the government’s policy for their “indiscriminate use”. He called for key workers and those identified as close contacts by Test and Trace to receive tests as a priority. Ministers are grappling to avoid panic that there are not enough tests putting further strain on supplies, in a repeat of the fuel crisis seen earlier this year. However, a significant surge in demand for tests was always likely given that the government told people to check they did not have the virus before seeing vulnerable relatives and socialising in big groups over the festive period. Covid cases have also risen to their highest levels due to the Omicron variant, meaning that significantly more close contacts may need to test to check whether they have been infected. Lucy Powell, Labour’s shadow culture secretary, said people “should be cautious about their new year” and that those socialising should “do it in a safe way”. She told Sky News that if everyone could get access to a test before going out, that would be “absolutely critical” to decreasing the risk of Covid transmission at new year gatherings. “I’ll be having a very boring night in this year on my own,” Powell said of her own plans. Those struggling to order a test online were told to “keep trying”. Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK health security agency, admitted there were “some difficulties across the country both with pharmacies and with home testing requests”. But she added: “We do release – and are continuing to release – test slots for individuals, so they should just keep trying through the day.”",News/World news,"UK Covid test shortage amid new year parties ‘very worrying’, says scientist",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/uk-covid-test-shortage-amid-new-year-parties-very-worrying-says-scientist
