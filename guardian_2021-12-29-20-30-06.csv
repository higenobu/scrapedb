12/29/2021,"John Terry is set to return to Chelsea next month after agreeing to take up a part-time role as a coaching consultant in the club’s academy. The former England captain has been looking for a fresh opportunity after leaving his role as Aston Villa’s assistant manager last summer. Terry is keen to become a manager and hopes to gain more coaching experience by working with Chelsea’s youngsters.  The 41-year-old, who is regarded as one of the greatest players in Chelsea’s history, will contribute to coaching discussions with colleagues, mentor academy players and support parent dialogue. The Stamford Bridge club said that the flexibility will allow Terry to continue his coaching development and maintain other commitments. “We are delighted to be welcoming John back to Cobham in a role that will involve coaching and mentoring the next generation of young players in our Academy,” Neil Bath, Chelsea’s academy director, said. “It goes without saying that John’s experience in the game, both as a world-class player and more recently as an assistant coach in the Premier League, will be invaluable for everyone in the building. He will be a great mentor for our players and a fantastic asset to our coaching staff. We can’t wait for him to get started.” Terry joined Chelsea as a 14-year-old scholar and went on to enjoy an illustrious playing career. He became Chelsea’s captain and established himself as one of the best defenders in the world before joining Villa in 2017. Terry would go on to enjoy his time at Villa Park. He became Dean Smith’s assistant after retiring in October 2018 and helped Villa win promotion from the Championship in 2019. Chelsea have been keen to bring former players back to the club. Petr Cech, their former goalkeeper, is the club’s technical and performance adviser and Paulo Ferreira, Ashley Cole, Carlo Cudicini and Claude Makélélé have roles.",Sport/Football,John Terry set to return to Chelsea academy as coaching consultant,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/29/john-terry-set-to-return-to-chelsea-academy-as-coaching-consultant
12/29/2021,"Pubs, bars and restaurants missed out on more than £10,000 each in the week leading up to Christmas, figures show, as concern about the Omicron variant and government guidance to work from home ruined the crucial festive period for the second year in a row. Sales were down by as much as 60% compared with the same period in 2019, according to the trade body UK Hospitality.  Trading had been close to pre-pandemic levels before the emergence of Omicron but plummeted as consumer confidence collapsed, it said. Work from home guidance meant city centre venues were particularly hard hit, while takings at the average venue were down £10,335 compared with 2019 levels on a nationwide basis. Kate Nicholls, UK Hospitality’s chief executive, said the figures showed that the government should not impose any new restrictions affecting the sector and should increase the level of government support on offer. Before Christmas, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, announced a package of measures to help the sector, including grants of up to £6000. However, the UK Hospitality figures suggest venues have lost considerably more than the value of the grants in a single week. “Hospitality businesses have been hit hard during a key trading period – and this after missing out on the crucial Christmas and New Year sales last year,” said Nicholls. “Restrictions must be kept to a minimum and must be lifted as quickly as possible to help an already beleaguered sector or many will simply not survive – and those who do make it through face a return to 20% VAT in April.” UK Hospitality and businesses within the sector have repeatedly called on the government to extend the temporary lower VAT rate of 12.5% for hospitality, or even to return it to the emergency 5% rate that was in place until October this year. While hospitality has been hard hit by measures intended to slow the spread of Covid-19, figures suggest that the pandemic is yet to have a significant effect on pub closures. The number of pubs in England and Wales dropped by 400 during 2021 to 40,173. However, the rate of decline was slower than in previous years. England and Wales lost 446 pubs in 2020 and 473 in 2019, the last full year with no pandemic effect. The steepest fall in recent years occurred in 2018, when 918 pubs were lost during the year.",News/Business,"UK pubs, bars and restaurants lost £10,000 each in week before Christmas",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/29/uk-pubs-bars-and-restaurants-lost-10000-each-in-week-before-christmas
12/29/2021,"Inflation is near a 40-year high. Central banks around the world just promised to intervene. However, a critical factor that is driving up prices remains largely overlooked: an explosion in profits. In 2021, US non-financial profit margins have reached levels not seen since the aftermath of the second world war. This is no coincidence. The end of the war required a sudden restructuring of production which created bottlenecks similar to those caused by the pandemic. Then and now large corporations with market power have used supply problems as an opportunity to increase prices and scoop windfall profits. The Federal Reserve has taken a hawkish turn this month. But cutting monetary stimulus will not fix supply chains. What we need instead is a serious conversation about strategic price controls – just like after the war. Today economists are divided into two camps on the inflation question: team Transitory argues we ought not to worry about inflation since it will soon go away. Team Stagflation urges for fiscal restraint and a raise in interest rates. But there is a third option: the government could target the specific prices that drive inflation instead of moving to austerity which risks a recession.  To use a metaphor: if your house is on fire, you would not want to wait until the fire eventually dies out. Neither do you wish to destroy the house by flooding it. A skillful firefighter extinguishes the fire where it is burning to prevent contagion and save the house. History teaches us that such a targeted approach is also possible for price increases. The White House Council of Economic Advisers suggests that the best historical analogy for today’s inflation is the aftermath of the second world war. Then and now there was pent up demand thanks to high household savings. During the war this was a result of rising incomes and rationing; during Covid-19 that of stimulus checks and shutdowns. At both times supply chains were disrupted. This is as far as the White House advisers’ interpretation of the parallel between the two episodes goes. What they do not tell us is that the inflation after the war was not without an alternative. During the second world war the Roosevelt administration imposed strict price controls and instituted the Office of Price Administration. In comparison with the first world war, price rises were low, while the increase in output was almost beyond imagination. After the war, the question was what to do with the price controls. Should they be released in one big bang as southern Democrats, Republicans and big business were urging? Or did price controls have a role to play in the transition to a postwar economy? Some of the most distinguished American economists of the 20th century called for a continuation of price controls in the New York Times. This included the likes of Paul Samuelson, Irving Fisher, Frank Knight, Simon Kuznets, Paul Sweezy and Wesley Mitchell, as well as 11 former presidents of the American Economic Association. The reasons they presented for price controls also apply to our present situation. They argued that as long as bottlenecks made it impossible for supply to meet demand, price controls for important goods should be continued to prevent prices from shooting up. The tsar of wartime price controls, John Kenneth Galbraith, joined these calls. He explained “the role of price controls” would be “strategic”. “No more than the economist ever supposed will it stop inflation,” he added. “But it both establishes the base and gains the time for the measures that do.” President Truman was aware of the risks of ending price controls. On 30 October 1945, he warned that after the first world war, the US had “simply pulled off the few controls that had been established, and let nature take its course”. And he urged, “The result should stand as a lesson to all of us. A dizzy upward spiral of wages and the cost of living ended in the crash of 1920 – a crash that spread bankruptcy and foreclosure and unemployment throughout the Nation.” Nevertheless, price controls were pulled in 1946, again triggering inflation and a boom-bust cycle. Today, there is once more a choice between tolerating the ongoing explosion of profits that drives up prices or tailored controls on carefully selected prices. Price controls would buy time to deal with bottlenecks that will continue as long as the pandemic prevails. Strategic price controls could also contribute to the monetary stability needed to mobilize public investments towards economic resilience, climate change mitigation and carbon-neutrality. The cost of waiting for inflation to go away is high. Senator Manchin’s withdrawal from the Build Back Better Act demonstrates the threat of a shrinking policy space at a time when large scale government action is in order. Austerity would be even worse: it risks manufacturing stagflation. We need a systematic consideration of strategic price controls as a tool in the broader policy response to the enormous macroeconomic challenges instead of pretending there is no alternative beyond wait-and-see or austerity.

12/29/2021,"It’s a now-perennial headline: Facebook has had a very bad year. Years of mounting pressure from Congress and the public culminated in repeated PR crises, blockbuster whistleblower revelations and pending regulation over the past 12 months.  And while the company’s bottom line has not yet wavered, 2022 is not looking to be any better than 2021 – with more potential privacy and antitrust actions on the horizon. Here are some of the major battles Facebook has weathered in the past year. Facebook’s year started with allegations that a deadly insurrection on the US Capitol was largely planned on its platform. Regulatory uproar over the incident reverberated for months, leading lawmakers to call CEO Mark Zuckerberg before Congress to answer for his platform’s role in the attack. In the aftermath, Zuckerberg defended his decision not to take action against Donald Trump, though the former president stoked anger and separatist flames on his personal and campaign accounts. Facebook’s inaction led to a rare public employee walkout and Zuckerberg later reversed the hands-off approach to Trump. Barring Trump from Facebook platforms sparked backlash once again – this time from Republican lawmakers alleging censorship. What ensued was a months-long back-and-forth between Facebook and its independent oversight board, with each entity punting the decision of whether to keep Trump off the platform. Ultimately, Facebook decided to extend Trump’s suspension to two years. Critics said this underscored the ineffectiveness of the body. “What is the point of the oversight board?” asked the Real Oversight Board, an activist group monitoring Facebook, after the non-verdict. The scandal with perhaps the biggest impact on the company this year came in the form of the employee-turned-whistleblower Frances Haugen, who leaked internal documents that exposed some of the inner workings of Facebook and just how much the company knew about the harmful effects its platform was having on users and society. Haugen’s revelations, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, showed Facebook was aware of many of its grave public health impacts and had the means to mitigate them – but chose not to do so. For instance, documents show that since at least 2019, Facebook has studied the negative impact Instagram had on teenage girls and yet did little to mitigate the harms and publicly denied that was the case. Those findings in particular led Congress to summon company executives to multiple hearings on the platform and teen users. Facebook has since paused its plans to launch an Instagram app for kids and introduced new safety measures encouraging users to take breaks if they use the app for long periods of time. In a Senate hearing on 8 December, the Instagram executive Adam Mosseri called on Congress to launch an independent body tasked with regulating social media more comprehensively, sidestepping calls for Instagram to regulate itself. Haugen also alleged Facebook’s tweaks to its algorithm, which turned off some safeguards intended to fight misinformation, may have led to the Capitol attack. She provided information underscoring how little of its resources it dedicates to moderating non-English language content. In response to the Haugen documents, Congress has promised legislation and drafted a handful of new bills to address Facebook’s power. One controversial measure would target Section 230, a portion of the Communications Decency Act that exempts companies from liability for content posted on their platforms. Haugen was not the only whistleblower to take on Facebook in 2021. In April, the former Facebook data scientist turned whistleblower Sophie Zhang revealed to the Guardian that Facebook repeatedly allowed world leaders and politicians to use its platform to deceive the public or harass opponents. Zhang has since been called to testify on these findings before parliament in the UK and India. Lawmakers around the world are eager to hear from the Facebook whistleblowers. Haugen also testified in the UK regarding the documents she leaked, telling MPs Facebook “prioritizes profit over safety”. Such testimony is likely to influence impending legislation, including the Online Safety Bill: a proposed act in the UK that would task the communications authority Ofcom with regulating content online and requiring tech firms to protect users from harmful posts or face substantial fines. Though Apple has had its fair share of regulatory battles, Facebook did not find an ally in its fellow tech firm while facing down the onslaught of consumer and regulatory pressure that 2021 brought. The iPhone maker in April launched a new notification system to alert users when and how Facebook was tracking their browsing habits, supposedly as a means to give them more control over their privacy. Facebook objected to the new policy, arguing Apple was doing so to “self-preference their own services and targeted advertising products”. It said the feature would negatively affect small businesses relying on Facebook to advertise. Apple pressed on anyway, rolling it out in April and promising additional changes in 2022. Preliminary reports suggest Apple is, indeed, profiting from the change while Google and Facebook have seen advertising profits fall. In early October, just weeks after Haugen’s revelations, things took a sudden turn for the worse when the company faced a global service outage. Perhaps Facebook’s largest and most sustained tech failure in recent history, the glitch left billions of users unable to access Facebook, Instagram or Whatsapp for six hours on 4 and 5 October. Facebook’s share price dropped 4.9% that day, cutting Zuckerberg’s personal wealth by $6bn, according to Bloomberg. As Facebook faces continuing calls for accountability, its time as the wunderkind of Silicon Valley has come to a close and it has become a subject of bipartisan contempt. Republicans repeatedly have accused Facebook of being biased against conservatism, while liberals have targeted the platform for its monopolistic tendencies and failure to police misinformation. In July, the Biden administration began to take a harder line with the company over vaccine misinformation – which Joe Biden said was “killing people” and the US surgeon general said was “spreading like wildfire” on the platform. Meanwhile, the appointment of the antitrust thought leader Lina Khan to head of the FTC spelled trouble for Facebook. She has been publicly critical of the company and other tech giants in the past, and in August refiled a failed FTC case accusing Facebook of anti-competitive practices. After a year of struggles, Facebook has thrown something of a Hail Mary: changing its name. The company announced it would now be called Meta, a reference to its new “metaverse” project, which will create a virtual environment where users can spend time. The name change was met with derision and skepticism from critics. But it remains to be seen whether Facebook, by any other name, will beat the reputation that precedes it.",News/Technology,"Facebook’s very bad year.

12/29/2021,"Scottish revellers planning to travel to English cities for Hogmanay celebrations have been urged to stay at home, to avoid spreading the Omicron variant. John Swinney, Scotland’s deputy first minister, said travelling to England to bypass the closure of all nightclubs in Scotland would be the “wrong course of action” and went against the spirit of Scottish policy.  “People are free to take those decisions, but I would discourage them from doing so,” Swinney said on BBC Breakfast on Wednesday morning. “I think it is the wrong course of action for people to take because we have a serious situation we have got to manage and we encourage everybody to play their part in addressing that.” Swinney, the Scottish government’s Covid response minister, said the rate of spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 was “alarming” and rising far faster than any previous variant. Earlier this week, Scotland reported its highest ever number of daily cases reported on Sunday, at 11,030. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, is due to update the Scottish parliament later on Wednesday and may unveil further restrictions. She said the country should be braced for even more cases in the near future. The Scottish government ordered all nightclubs to close for at least three weeks from 27 December in an effort to suppress the latest waves. At the same time, outdoor events were limited to 500 people. The country’s main open-air Hogmanay and New Year’s Day events, including the street party and concerts organised in Edinburgh, have been cancelled. With Omicron infections surging, Scottish ministers have urged people to limit any celebrations to a maximum of three family groups. Unlike in England, where venues are being allowed to remain open, the Welsh government has also shut down nightclubs and ordered pubs to impose 1-metre social distancing. Furious business owners in Wales fear revellers will cross the border to English venues instead. Welsh urban centres are much closer to England than Scotland’s major cities. Swinney said he was asking for voluntary restraint, but his request echoes restrictions on travel over the Scotland-England border in July 2020 after a significant outbreak in the Dumfries area, with linked cases in Carlisle. That led to Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, ordering people not to travel further than five miles from home. Swinney, the Scottish government’s Covid response minister, said: “People have got to make their own choices, they have got to follow the advice we put in place. We have the power in Scotland to put in place certain restrictions and we have done those on what we consider to be a proportionate and appropriate basis.”",News/UK news,Scottish revellers urged not to travel to England for New Year’s Eve ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/29/scottish-revellers-urged-not-to-travel-to-england-for-new-years-eve-omicron
12/29/2021,"The Guardian’s men’s Test team of the year is back, for its eighth edition. This year’s selectors were Ali Martin, Jonathan Liew, Rob Smyth, Emma John, Adam Collins, Tim de Lisle and myself. Eagle-eyed readers may spot that there’s not a single Australian in it. That has everything to do with the fact that when we picked our XI (before the Boxing Day Tests) the team had played only three Tests this year, all at home, and nothing to do with the Australian selector being outnumbered six to one. Promise.  906 runs at 48 A unanimous pick. Made important contributions during India’s series win in Australia, then stepped up a gear when he made a match-defining 161 in India’s 317-run victory against England on a spinning pitch in the second Test in Chennai. He followed that with 15 consecutive double-figures innings, a run that finished with his first overseas century, another match-winning innings against England, in very different conditions, during their 157-run victory in the fourth Test at the Oval. Finishes the year as India’s white ball captain, so one of the most influential men in world cricket. 902 runs at 69 The captaincy has been the making of Karunaratne, who had the best year of his long career. Away from home, his 103 was the one bright spot in an embarrassing defeat to South Africa at the Wanderers, and he also batted four hours to secure a draw in the second Test on tour in West Indies. England’s 2-0 victory in Sri Lanka might have worked out differently if he’d been fit, because his home form has been imperious. He made 244, and 118 against Bangladesh, and 147 against West Indies. Is averaging 50 as skipper. 395 runs at 66 Williamson has been struggling with an elbow injury, which he nursed through tours of England and India. It meant that more than half his runs came in one innings, when he made 238 against Pakistan in Christchurch. But he was back, and right in the thick of it, for the biggest match his team played, the World Test Championship final against India in Southampton. He made an over-my-dead body 49 in the first innings, and was there unbeaten on 52 at the finish. It was a fitting reward for the most impressive captain in the sport. 1,708 runs at 61, 14 wickets at 30 No Englishman has had a year quite like Root did in 2021, when he finally became the truly dominant batsman he always promised to be. He started with 228 and 186 in two Tests against Sri Lanka in Galle, and followed that with his monumental 218 against India in Chennai. Back home, he peeled off 109, 180* and 121 in successive matches against India. Which meant his 89 in the first Ashes Test almost felt like a failure. Right now, he is the world’s best batsman. The shame is that, at the end of it all, his team have so few Test victories to show for it. 571 runs at 57 Ungainly, unorthodox, but irresistibly effective, Alam lapped up a first full year of Test cricket. He had spent a decade waiting for a second chance after he made his debut in 2009, 88 Tests on the sidelines, and this was his chance to show the Pakistan selectors what they had been missing. Made the top score of 109 in Pakistan’s victory over South Africa in Karachi, after the team had been 27 for four, followed it up with 140* against Zimbabwe in Harare and 124* against the West Indies at Sabina Park. He was the only century-maker on either side in all three matches. 706 runs at 42, 26 catches, six stumpings (not including current Test v South Africa) If the only thing Pant did in 2021 was hit that one reverse-lap sweep for four off Jimmy Anderson, you would still remember his year. As it was, his devil-may-care batting made him one of the key players in India’s series victory in Australia, where he made a crucial 97 in the draw at Sydney and an extraordinary 89* in the win at Brisbane. He worked over England, too, with 91, 58*, and 101 in the series at home. His form fell away on the return tour later in the summer but he still finished with a fine 50 at the Oval. 337 runs at 28, 52 wickets at 16 (not including current Test v South Africa) Ashwin played only eight of India’s 13 Tests this year, and somehow he still ended up as the leading wicket-taker in Test cricket (at the time of writing). After years of ceaseless tinkering and thinking, he has turned himself into the greatest spin bowler of his era. At home, he’s unplayable. He picked up 32 wickets in four Tests against England, and another 14 in two home Tests against New Zealand. In among all that, he made a handsome century against England in Chennai, and was unbeaten on 39 at stumps when India drew in Sydney. 253 runs at 23, 22 wickets at 23 Holder may have lost the captaincy after five and a half years in charge when the selectors replaced him with his friend Kraigg Brathwaite, but he has plenty to be getting on with, batting at No 6 or 7, often opening the bowling, and catching bullets in the field. His batting has suffered, although he played two crucial innings when he made 71* in a draw against Sri Lanka and 58 in a victory over Pakistan, and his parsimonious medium pace means he’s currently the world’s top-ranked all-rounder. 27 wickets at 18 Took to Test cricket like he had been built for it in a laboratory hidden somewhere in the reaches of New Zealand’s south island. He destroyed Pakistan when he took 11 for 117 in Christchurch at the start of the year and at the moment it mattered most turned in a man-of-the-match performance in the World Test championship final. He took seven wickets in the match, including five for 31 in the first innings when he dismissed Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli when they were threatening to run away with the game. 25 wickets at 29 (not including current Test v South Africa) Bumrah is way off the sort of electric form he showed in his first year of Test cricket but with his clockwork toy action and wicked yorker, he’s one of the reliably entertaining bowlers in the game. He dominated England in the first Test of India’s summer tour at Trent Bridge, where he took four cheap wickets in one innings and five more in the other, and was even better in India’s victory at the Oval, where he turned the game on its head with a wildfire six-over spell on a tarmac-flat track late on the fifth day. 47 wickets at 17 Still only 21, Afridi has grown into the most electric player on the international circuit. His devilish left-arm pace, all waspish full balls and ripping bouncers, cut through every team he’s played this year. He has taken wickets in New Zealand, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, and against South Africa in Pakistan, but was at his best in the second Test against West Indies at Sabina Park, where he took career-best figures of 10 for 94.

12/29/2021,"March 2020: an insidious virus seeds itself across the globe pitching tens of thousands in the European continent into a life-and-death battle. Most European countries secure their borders; millions of households lock their front doors. Hellish scenes flash by, feeding fears of infection. In Europe a disaster is unfolding, but there is no joint response. The loudest cry comes from Italy, hit by the virus early on. Appeals for help go unanswered and bitter reproaches ensue. The EU is slow to react: the fact that Brussels’ institutions lack the “competences”, or formal powers, to act in the field of public health impresses no one. When, soon thereafter, an economic depression looms, prophets of doom start predicting the end of the EU.  Then the union suddenly began to show a remarkable dynamism and resilience. The pandemic led to mishaps, distrust and fierce clashes of all kinds, but it also mobilised unforeseen forces and led to huge political shifts. In the summer of 2020, the bloc’s presidents and prime ministers took two far-reaching decisions: the EU would purchase vaccines centrally, and it would establish a massive coronavirus recovery fund. There was no more talk about “competences”. The EU reinvented itself. How was this possible? During the Covid-19 disaster, more than in previous crises, political decision-making followed public demand for action. All citizens felt threatened in their own bodies. The disease was nobody’s fault. This crisis was so overwhelming – the strange lockdowns, the mass layoffs, the geo-medical “divide and rule” by China and the US – that “Europe” had to do something in response. Pandemic despair forced the union to assume a form it did not previously possess. Day after day, European societies counted and blessed the sick and the dead, tuned in for televised proclamations by monarchs, presidents or prime ministers, sang from balconies and applauded medical staff in the evenings. These were intensely experienced moments of national belonging. At the same time, neighbouring states grew closer than ever in their suffering, their lockdown rules, their intensive-care policies and death rates. Leaving aside pandemic empathy; observing other countries had its uses at home. The media compared their own governments with others. Why was Austria testing more aggressively than France? Why were more people dying in Britain than in Greece? But in the EU, with its single market, currency and shared borders, this went beyond mere comparison. Decisions next door had direct repercussions on people’s lives. What if Germany pumped billions into its own economy and Italy could not? What if Sweden took a lax attitude to Covid and kept their borders open? What if Hungary accepted a Russian vaccine? Some national publics were quick to say to their neighbours: this decision of yours is our business too. Conversely, several national leaders reached out to a broader, European public. This interplay was new. By contrast, the financial storms of 2008 onwards had been calmed in top-down ways. Governments, alarmed by central bankers and experts, had to convince reluctant parliaments of the need for drastic decisions to save the banking system and the currency. The public looked on, not having asked for anything. The economic freedoms introduced by the Brussels machinery from 1957 onwards were likewise bestowed from on high, as a favour, not extracted from below as a demand. In the pandemic, however, primacy lay for the first time with the public. Acknowledging the dynamism of the situation and stepping up to act for the public – these are the responses we demand from our political leaders. Hence the condemnation of the early Brussels defence. When history comes knocking, a lack of formal powers is no excuse. What counts is the capacity shown in the situation at hand to engage in “events politics”, meaning to identify and parry a shock affecting all citizens, to improvise and persuade in the moment; and, by extension, to anticipate events and increase the system’s resilience. Such cases do not require legal competences but rather the acceptance of personal, political responsibility. Few leaders were more keenly aware of this than Angela Merkel. The pandemic was the last big European crisis of her 16 years as German chancellor, and her performance was masterful. By Easter 2020 she could feel how faultlines were hardening, how political fights over solidarity were flaring up between Europe’s north and south. Daily she read reports of how Covid-19 was driving the heart of the eurozone and its Mediterranean periphery apart economically (a risk for German exporters). And so she decided on 18 May 2020, after thorough consideration, to jump. On behalf of the Federal Republic, she assumed responsibility for a €500bn EU coronavirus recovery fund, to be disbursed in the form of grants not loans. Something that had remained taboo during the dangerous eurozone crisis was suddenly possible. Merkel displayed a seismologist’s sensitivity to undercurrents and aftershocks in the public sphere. This unique ordeal could produce heaves and landslips, abrupt emotional eruptions. “Our country is dying,” the leaders in Rome and Madrid told her – and so pandemic aid could not be conditional; that would be humiliating. Nor was it possible to ignore the fact that the Italian public’s trust in the union was plummeting, and for two out of three Italians leaving had become an option. Shifts in the public sphere are pure politics. The outcome is not just the sum of objective forces (such as a country’s trade balance, arsenal or technological capabilities). They are also, indeed above all, a matter of humour and sentiment, gratitude and rancour, memory and expectation, words and stories, expressed in mostly unstable balances and changing majorities. Yet that is no reason to dismiss the public mood as fickle. It can be read, felt and influenced. Moreover, public opinion is capable of pushing aside or shattering many supposedly objective realities, as became clear during the pandemic. In March 2020, the Dutch finance minister Wopke Hoekstra made an insensitive proposal that the European Commission should investigate the absence of financial buffers in Italy and Spain. It was a rude swipe aimed at garnering applause from the Dutch home audience, but it provoked boos and hisses from all over Europe, and Hoekstra had to slink away, having misjudged the nature, size and mood of his European audience. Other actors actively sought out a wider European gallery. Southern Europe revived an old desire from the euro crisis: a call for the issuing of joint debt. It did so classically, in a letter dated 25 March sent from nine government leaders to Charles Michel, the president of the European council. Far more effectively, several days later local politicians in Italy bought a full-page advertisement in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung to appeal to the German public to support “corona bonds”. It is sometimes claimed that because we don’t all speak the same language there is no European public space. That is nonsense. Applause and catcalls are universally understood. The public that politicians deal with consists of more than just the voters whose verdict they submit to every few years. During the pandemic, the European public discovered its role. It became clear that our lives and our health are a public matter. We want politicians who protect us, save lives and chart a path to the future. This swelling emergency call drowned out the usual whistling down of each Brussels initiative as unwelcome interference in national affairs. A European res publica translated itself from formless task into political decision. At a moment of great vulnerability, a pandemonic battle of words made the European Union defend what its people hold most dearly, and gave it new political force.
