3/29/2022,"“Manhood,” a friend texted me after Will Smith’s Chris Rock slap at the Oscars, “often comes down to weighing the moment against the future.”
 The sender was Jimi Izrael, a writer who has been criticized as misogynist in his own work but who I once talked out of assaulting another writer who Jimi believed disrespected his late wife, the former NPR producer Temisha Walker, in an obituary after her 2013 death from cancer. Few things raise a man’s impulse toward violence like an attack–real or perceived–on our families. When it’s the women we love, the Black women who we’ve watched bear the scars of a lifetime of accumulated slights, the fuse is even shorter.

Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce But the thing about short fuses is they end in quick explosions that damage everyone nearby, including those we intended to shield from the blast. Smith’s assault of Rock and Jimi’s text crystallized a question many of us have had to interrogate: what does protecting Black women really look like? Does accountability for words always have to be meted out in violence, and if so, who accounts for the collateral damage?
 Those are questions Will Smith may never have to answer. Whatever motivated him to roll on Chris Rock, his attack happened in a sterile environment where potential repercussions were minimal. Rock has said he won’t file a police report. The LAPD says it’s not investigating. Oscars security let him stay through the ceremony, in the front row, like nothing happened. That’s not how it works when most of us choose violence. Unfortunately, many Black men spend a lifetime navigating when to make that choice, from defending ourselves on the street or in the workplace to taking up for our mothers, sisters, aunts or daughters when others mistreat them. I don’t know many men who’ve never had to make that choice. I made it as recently as a month ago, when a meaningless exchange of words in a Walmart parking lot triggered a snap judgment that I needed to protect my fiancee and 18-month-old. I wanted to hurt the man; I let him know, loudly, that I would. I spent the next several hours trying to convince a woman I couldn’t care more deeply about that in my judgment, it was all in her best interest.
 In hers, it was terrifying. What would our son, who already emulates everything I do, take from that exchange? What if the police got involved and I, a six-foot-four inch, 220-lb, violently angry Black man became the center of their attention? What if the other guy had a gun and the last time I endeavored to protect them was really the last time? What I’d spent a lifetime developing as a response to even slight aggression became a liability in the eyes of the person I’m closest to.

She wasn’t wrong, but while I disagree with how Smith handled the Chris Rock situation as poorly as humanly possible, his response still, oddly, resonated. Maybe it was a reflection of the work I still need to do to avoid another flare up like the one in the parking lot, or that somewhere deep, I don’t abhor what Smith did as much as I tell myself I do.",U.S./The Root,Will Smith at the Oscars: Was He Protecting Black Women or Displaying Toxic Masculinity?,https://news.yahoo.com/smith-protecting-black-women-toxic-192559855.html

Now, they are turning their attention to creating destinations in space. With the International Space Station set to be decommissioned by 2030, NASA will transition from premier gatekeeper of U.S. access to the space station to become just one of many customers of private space stations in what many hope will be a robust low-Earth orbit economy. Currently, there are only two destinations in low-Earth orbit, the ISS and a smaller modular station being built by China. Within the next decade, NASA expects that to change. Blue Origin's upcoming heavy-lift New Glenn rocket will have to wait at least another year for its Florida debut, according to recent comments by an executive later confirmed by the company itself. Speaking Tuesday during the Satellite 2022 conference in Washington, D.C., Blue Origin's senior vice president of the New Glenn program, Jarrett Jones, said the rocket would not fly from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station before the end of this year as previously planned. Details on a new timeframe were not offered. A Blue Origin spokesperson later confirmed Jones' comments and said the 322-foot rocket recently completed a design review but will not be ready in time to fly from Launch Complex 36 this year. ""After completing our final design review and getting our agreements with our current customers, it won’t be the end of this year,"" the spokesperson said. ""We’re communicating on a new date with our customers."" NASA will choose a second company to develop a lunar lander to complement SpaceX's Starship to ensure a sustainable human presence on the moon. NASA last year selected SpaceX as its sole commercial partner to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface from an orbiting ""Gateway"" space station as part of the agency's Artemis program. NASA administrator, Bill Nelson, said he expects about one human mission to the moon each year after Artemis III, now set for 2025. “But beyond Artemis III we want to increase the healthy competition and advance our lunar capabilities to support more science, more exploration and an emerging lunar marketplace,"" said Jim Free, associate administrator for NASA’s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate. OneWeb, the parent company of a Space Coast satellite manufacturing facility, signed a deal with SpaceX to launch internet satellites that had previously flown on Russian Soyuz rockets. In a brief statement, OneWeb said last week said it entered into an agreement with SpaceX to fly its internet-beaming satellites starting later this year. The company did not offer details on pricing and did not say which of the sites – Florida or California – would host the launches. ""Terms of the agreement with SpaceX are confidential,"" OneWeb said. A 25+ year veteran of FLORIDA TODAY, John McCarthy currently oversees the space team and special projects.

3/29/2022,"The Air Force plans to retire nearly three dozen of Tyndall Air Force Base’s F-22 fighter jets in fiscal 2023, ending tentative plans to move them to Virginia that have been on hold for more than three years. The Raptors have been flying out of nearby Eglin AFB in Florida since a hurricane destroyed Tyndall in October 2018. Officials want to divest 33 of the service’s oldest F-22s and use that money to instead research cutting-edge combat jet designs under the “Next-Generation Air Dominance” program. If Congress approves the idea, it would send all but three Block 20 Raptors to the “boneyard” at Davis-Monthan AFB in Tucson, Arizona, and shrink the overall fleet from 186 to 153 fighters. It’s too expensive to upgrade the stealth jets from their usual status as training planes so they can hold up in combat, said Maj. Gen. James Peccia, the Air Force’s deputy assistant budget secretary. That investment would cost $1.8 billion over eight years, which the Air Force believes is money better spent on upgrading newer F-22s with more advanced sensors and improving the F-35A Lightning II. “We will take operational jets and use them for training, but yet we can also take them and use them in the fight,” Peccia told reporters March 25. “It’s really using every dollar as smart as we can in our fighter portfolio when we’re trying to modernize that portfolio.” Airmen, F-22s struggle at Eglin nearly three years after Hurricane Michael The Air Force’s remaining F-22s would be redistributed across the Raptor squadrons, which include units at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia; Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii; and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, and Eglin. Each base would operate fewer jets than before, Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek said. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said he doesn’t expect further F-22 retirements in the short-term, adding that the jet remains the service’s premier air-to-air combat platform. Eglin has hosted flying operations for the 325th Fighter Wing since Hurricane Michael destroyed their previous home at Tyndall Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle. That includes the Air Force’s only F-22 training unit, the 43rd Fighter Squadron. After the Category 5 storm, the military pledged to rebuild Tyndall as a “base of the future” and F-35 hub. It took steps toward relocating the F-22 training enterprise to Joint Base Langley-Eustis, but the idea faltered during environmental inspections. “The transition of the F-22 [formal training unit] mission to JBLE is still being coordinated and we don’t have a specific timeline regarding the move at this point in time,” Air Combat Command spokesperson Alexi Worley said March 23. Air Force approves Joint Base Langley-Eustis as new home of F-22 training Air Force Times reported last June that the service was considering retiring the 325th Fighter Wing’s planes as part of phasing out the F-22, which it doesn’t envision as part of its future inventory after more than 20 years. “That drives a lot of uncertainty about what’s going to happen,” a former official told Air Force Times. “Are they actually going to move all those people in the FTU up there? Or are they going to retire the airplanes in place and send the people somewhere else?” The yearslong limbo has stressed airmen personally and professionally, complicated their housing and financial situations, and potentially contributed to a string of jet mishaps at the 325th. Of particular concern are situations where F-22 landing gears fail to deploy or collapse upon landing. An inspection of the Raptors at Eglin, and 10 percent of the fighters at other F-22 bases, found that at least one in five jets in the total F-22 inventory had an incorrectly rigged landing gear, Air Combat Command said last year. Worley said March 24 that over the past year, “a combination of inspections were performed across the fleet to help determine root cause, assess fleet health, evaluate system performance, and prevent future incidents.” F-22 jet pilot OK after apparent landing gear collapse at Eglin “Analysis of the data identified that nose landing gear rigging can change over time, and as a result, technical data was updated to clarify rigging procedures following maintenance actions,” she said. Overall, the Raptor fleet suffered 26 Class A and 36 Class B accidents between fiscal 2011 and 2021, according to the Air Force Safety Center. That equals about eight Class A and 11 Class B mishaps for every 100,000 flying hours. Class A mishaps cost at least $2 million, involve a destroyed aircraft or cause death or permanent and total disability. Class B mishaps are those that cost between $500,000 and $2 million, lead to a permanent, partial disability, or cause inpatient hospitalization of at least three people. One noncommissioned officer who works in F-22 maintenance said last summer that crews sometimes felt they could defer some upkeep until their short-term posting at Eglin was done. “This step here or a step there might be overlooked, because we’re only going to be here for so long. … It would be put off,” the NCO said. “Now, it’s all starting to catch up.”",Business/Defense News,Air Force wants to send Tyndall’s F-22 jets to the boneyard,https://news.yahoo.com/air-force-wants-send-tyndall-190253287.html
3/29/2022,"In the aftermath of the slap seen around the world, some are raising questions around whether or not Will Smith's Best Actor Oscar for King Richard is in jeopardy. On The View Monday morning, the co-hosts discussed the now infamous incident, with Academy Award winner, and previous Oscars host Whoopi Goldberg, predicting that Smith's award isn't in jeopardy. ""We're not going to take that Oscar from him,"" Goldberg said, after the question was posed by co-host Sunny Hostin. ""There will be consequences I'm sure, but I don't think that that's what they'll be, particularly because Chris said, listen I'm not pressing any charges."" ""Not everybody acts the way we would like them to under pressure, some people just snap, he snapped. What I do want to say is I think it's remarkable and wonderful that Chris Rock did not take it to that other place it could have gone."" Some have brought into question whether Smith is in violation of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences' code of conduct, which states that members must uphold the ""values of respect for human dignity, inclusion and a supportive environment that fosters creativity."" It also mentions that the Academy is ""categorically opposed to any form of abuse, harassment or discrimination."" The code of conduct was updated in 2017 as Harvey Weinstein was expelled from the Academy. “I think Will would not want to give his Oscar back, but who knows what will happen now,” the New York Post cites an anonymous Hollywood source saying Sunday night. According to an exclusive report from The Hollywood Reporter, the Academy's board of governors are having an ""emergency phone call"" about thee Smith-Rock incident, which could result in a suspension for Smith, but the outlet reports that he will not lose his Oscar for Best Actor. According to a Los Angeles Police Department, Rock chose to not file a police report.

3/29/2022,"Since Nipsey Hussle’s tragic death in March 2019, there’s been an intense custody battle over his now 13-year-old daughter, Emani Asghedom. According to new legal documents obtained by The Blast, Asghedom’s mother, Tanisha Foster, is seeking to end the current guardianship that’s in place for Emani and is requesting full custody. Foster also additionally requested a “neutral experience financial planner” to manage Emani’s inheritance. At the time of Nipsey Hussle’s death, Foster granted guardianship of Asghedom to the late rapper’s immediate family; which includes his brother, Sam, and sister, Samantha.

Amy Sussman/Getty Images In the court filing, Foster expressed, “I have continued to be an active part of Emani’s life. She spends the night with me often, I take her to school, and I continue to do the things a parent would do with their child. I am very unhappy that the guardians will not take my calls. I have to go through a third party or Emani to communicate with the guardians. There are no circumstances or events in my life that would disqualify me for regaining my exclusive role as Emani’s parent. There is no longer any need for guardianship. Emani routinely asks me when are she and I going to be able to live together. She longs to be with me as her mother. I am begging the court to terminate the existing guardianship.” Both parties were set to appear in court on Friday, March 25, but there’s currently no word on if the motion to terminate the guardianship was granted.
