Other oligarchs had previously been sanctioned, including Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg, Igor Rotenberg. Per The Times of Israel news report, tracking data showed the planes made trips from Turkey to Moscow and St. Petersburg and landed in Tel Aviv. Planes are now limited to a maximum of 48 hours on the ground in the country, according to Israel's Channel 12. Authorities asked Ben Gurion Airport not to approve long-term parking of private jets belonging to US-sanctioned Russians, per The Times of Israel.
