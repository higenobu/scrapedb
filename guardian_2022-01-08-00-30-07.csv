1/8/2022,"Sidney Poitier, whose groundbreaking acting work in the 1950s and 60s paved the way for generations of African American film stars, has died aged 94. His death was announced on Friday by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Bahamas, Fred Mitchell. Bahamas Prime Minister Chester Cooper said he was “conflicted with great sadness and a sense of celebration when I learned of the passing of Sir Sidney Poitier.“Sadness that he would no longer be here to tell him how much he means to us, but celebration that he did so much to show the world that those from the humblest beginnings can change the world and that we gave him his flowers while he was with us.  “We have lost an icon; a hero, a mentor, a fighter, a national treasure.” Poitier, who was born in Miami but raised in the Bahamas, was the first black winner of the best actor Oscar for Lilies of the Field and, along with Harry Belafonte, was a pioneering African-American presence in mainstream Hollywood cinema. Writing on Twitter shortly after his death was announced, Jeffrey Wright paid tribute to Poitier, calling him “a landmark actor. One of a kind. What a beautiful, gracious, warm, genuinely regal man. RIP, Sir. With love.” Born to Bahamian parents while they were visiting Miami to sell tomatoes in 1927, Poitier grew up in the Bahamas – then a British colony – but returned to the US aged 15, and worked at a series of low-paid jobs before briefly serving in the army during the second world war (and attempting to feign insanity to win a medical discharge). Somewhat directionless, Poitier auditioned for the high profile American Negro Theater, based in Harlem, and although he was rejected, he worked hard to improve his acting skills – including losing his Bahamian accident. After being allowed to attend classes, Poitier stepped in when Belafonte, then a star student, was unable to perform. Having been spotted by a Broadway director, Poitier subsequently carved out a nascent career in the black theatre circuit of the period. Poitier then secured his first significant film role, in the 1950 film noir No Way Out; he played a hospital doctor whose racist patient (played by Richard Widmark) starts a race riot. With its overt depiction of racial conflict, No Way Out was considered too controversial to be shown in southern states, but established Poitier’s trademark persona as sensitive, forbearing figure, more intelligent than the whites surrounding him. Though films examining the fraught state of race relations were popular at the time, there were still limited roles for black actors in the US. As one of the few who had made an impact, Poitier then shot the British-produced adaptation of Cry, the Beloved Country – though experiencing apartheid in South Africa by all accounts was a shattering experience, and pushed him towards activism. Poitier’s breakthrough role came back in the US, with another social comment picture: Blackboard Jungle, in 1955, in which he played a rebellious high school student. The film was a hit, with its use of Bill Haley’s Rock Around the Clock ensuring a large teenage audience; in the UK it inspired the infamous Elephant and Castle teddy boy riot of 1956. Poitier continued to win plaudits: he played a dock worker who mentors John Cassavetes’ drifter in Edge of the City, and then secured an groundbreaking Oscar nomination as best actor for The Defiant Ones, the Stanley Kramer message movie about social co-operation, in which he played a convict who escapes in the deep south while shackled to Tony Curtis. (Both Curtis and Poitier were nominated; they lost to David Niven for Separate Tables.) He continued to take on ideologically-charged roles, such as Porgy in Otto Preminger’s film of Porgy and Bess, and the lead in A Raisin in the Sun, the adaptation of Lorraine Hansberry’s much-admired play about family life in racially-segregated Chicago. (Poitier had appeared in the same role in the original theatrical production in 1959.) He finally won his Oscar for the earnest drama Lilies of the Field in 1964; he played a handyman who helps a group of German nuns build a chapel in the Arizona desert. After the interracial romance A Patch of Blue (which, again, was censored in the south with scenes of Poitier kissing his white co-star Elizabeth Hartman being removed), Poitier would experience arguably his high-water mark as an actor in 1967, with three hit films. To Sir with Love, was a British-produced answer to Blackboard Jungle, featuring Judy Geeson and Lulu in its cast; In the Heat of the Night, directed by Norman Jewison, starred Poitier as shades-wearing detective Virgil Tibbs investigating a murder in a racist Mississippi town; and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner?, which again tackled the thorny subject of interracial romance. However, despite two further Tibbs movies (They Call Me Mister Tibbs! and The Organization in 1970 and 1971 respectively), Poitier suddenly found himself out of favour, as a more confrontational, politicised attitude gained traction in the wake of the civil rights struggle; Poitier responded by reinventing himself as a director. For his debut, Buck and the Preacher, he cast himself opposite Belafonte in a civil war western; however, his directorial output would largely consist of comedy pieces. He cast then-hot comic Bill Cosby in Uptown Saturday Night (1974), Let’s Do It Again (1975) and A Piece of the Action (1977) – though his best known directorial entry is arguably Stir Crazy, the 1980 jail comedy starring Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor. Poitier largely retreated from cinema in the late 1980s and 1990s, directing Cosby in Ghost Dad and taking odd roles in the likes of thriller Sneakers; he assumed the role of elder statesman in both cinematic and diplomatic circles. Having been knighted in 1974 (due to his Bahamian citizenship), he was appointed Bahamas ambassador to Japan in 1997, and received an honorary Oscar in 2002. In 2009 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a Bafta fellowship in 2016. Poitier was married twice: to Juanita Hardy between 1950 and 1965 (with whom he had four children), and subsequently to Joanna Shimkus in 1976 (with whom he had a further two).",Arts/Film,"Sidney Poitier, African American acting pioneer, dies aged 94",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/07/sidney-poitier-in-the-heat-of-the-night-acting-pioneer-dies

1/8/2022,"The US economy ended the year with disappointing job growth figures for December, adding just 199,000 workers to the non-farming labor force. Economists had been expecting more than double that number – 422,000 – suggesting that the US economy was improving, but erratically, as worker shortages troubled employers even before the Omicron coronavirus variant arrived, threatening another recovery stall.  Figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the US unemployment rate fell to 3.9%, and that job creation was highest in leisure and hospitality, a key recovery sector, which added 53,000. Professional and business services contributed 43,000 while manufacturing added 26,000. “The muted 199,000 gain in non-farm payrolls and the more muted increase in labor force participation suggest that worker shortages were becoming a bigger restraint on employment growth, even before the Omicron surge in infections, which could knock hundreds of thousands off payrolls in January,” noted Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics. But the slower-than-anticipated pace of hiring is offset by the record number of positions in 2021 and jobless claims registered at 207,000 last week close to the lowest level in 50 years. But the latest numbers suggested continued uncertainty over the course of a US economy that had begun rebounding strongly between waves of Covid disruption. The latest Omicron surge, which has disrupted transportation, office reopenings and hospitality, has shown that expectations of a smooth recovery are misplaced. “The volatility incurred by Omicron sweeping across America means that the data point of today is basically useless in assessing tomorrow,” said George Ball, chairman of financial services firm Sanders Morris Harris, told NBC TV on Friday morning. The disappointing job figures may also cause US central bankers to reconsider plans to accelerate reductions in stimulus spending as they attempt to balance job growth against tackling inflation that stands close to a 40-year high. Fed officials predict three rate rises this year, with a further five by the end of 2024 as it moves toward its goal of bringing inflation to a 2% target and achieving maximum employment. But the Fed chairman, Jay Powell, has also said that the central bank is watching wage growth closely for further evidence that the economy could turn into a repeating self-reinforcing battle between rising costs and wage gains. Average pay rose 0.4% in December, indicating that wages rose around 4.8% in 2021. But that’s still beneath the rate of inflation, most recently pegged at 6.8%. Still, weekly jobless claims are around 200,000 – or at a level below the 2019 weekly average from before the pandemic – but the labor force overall remains about 2.4 million workers below pre-pandemic levels, reflecting ongoing disruptions related to the virus. Friday’s figures reflect how tricky it is to forecast an economy that’s still being roiled by a pandemic. ADP Research Institute data released on Wednesday showed that US companies added the most jobs in seven months using data that is less comprehensive than the analysis put out by the labor department on Friday. Economists had predicted half the number of job gains, with the ADP chief economist, Nela Richardson, saying the hiring was “broad-based”. Higher wages and more attractive working terms may have been behind the surge, but many economists warn that the fast-spreading Omicron variant could affect hiring. Capital Economics’ Pearce warned that employees off work would still be paid, and therefore counted as employed, and not show up in employment figures in the latest figures. “The rapid spread of Omicron doesn’t appear to have delivered a big hit to services demand yet, but we expect widespread absenteeism could supersize the economy’s worker shortage this month,” Pearce said. “The key takeaway for the Fed is that, with few signs of a recovery in labour supply, the continued decline in the unemployment rate and surge in wage growth looks set to be sustained over 2022,” he added.",News/Business,"US workforce grows by just 199,000 in disappointing December",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/07/us-jobs-report-december-latest-edited-

1/8/2022,"Zack Snyder’s Justice League: 4hrs 2mins. The Irishman: 3hrs 29mins. The latest James Bond, the longest ever: 2hrs 43mins. Some of the most hyped films of the past few years have been as known for their length as their plot. So is this the new normal – are films getting longer? I asked Sarah Atkinson, professor of screen media at King’s College London. I loved Tenet, but I remember craving an interval and an ice-cream. Am I the only one feeling films are longer?Cinema is a bit of a machine, and is surrounded by marketing, so what we hear is often what we remember. These days, there’s a lot of talk about long running times. It’s all part of incentivising people to go out and pay for a ticket, which they won’t do unless it’s for something special – a big, epic film. Just look at the Marvel franchise: almost every one is well over two hours.  The Marvel thing of putting a scene after the credits was a global crime against bladders. Did you come across Przemysław Jarząbek, the data scientist who crunched the numbers around film length?I did, and he found that, on average, film length isn’t going up; we just think it is. That doesn’t surprise me. It is all marketing. Why the need to incentivise people to go to the cinema? Aren’t films making money through streaming?Yes, but Amazon and Netflix cut out the distributors, the marketers, and even the cinemas themselves. Also, films can’t be entered into the Oscars unless they’ve had a cinematic release. Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma – another epic – went straight to Netflix but also aired in cinemas. Cuarón himself even said people should see it on the big screen because it’s a cinematic film. Isn’t a film cinematic merely by virtue of being in the cinema?I know what you mean. Is a film more epic just because it’s made more use of digital tech? It’s weird the way a film’s length can be a sticking point, yet many of us have no problem bingeing 10 episodes of a series …That’s not really a fair comparison. Streamed series are by their nature fast-paced, with multiple storylines and characters and cliffhangers. Whereas epic films such as Dune, and The Lord of the Rings before it, are full of indulgent, long, sweeping camera shots: scenes without dialogue simply to show the beauty of the image. How has the pandemic changed film?Virtual production has taken off. So you don’t have to be in a location – you can be in a large studio, projecting whatever image you need, which increases the opportunity for special effects and more dramatic scenes. The TV series The Mandalorian is the epitome of this: the actors performed in front of an enormous LED screen. Progress in virtual production that was supposed to take four years happened in one because the industry knew it was the only way stuff would get finished. I’ve enjoyed seeing film-makers use the tools at hand. I saw one horror film, Host, that takes place over Zoom; it was about an hour long. They say 90 minutes is the optimal time for a horror. It’s good to hear low-budget and indie films are flying the flag for shorter runtimes – and still getting made.They’re getting made more than ever, because of the accessibility of technology and the abundance of ways to view. We still have film festivals; it’s just that the marketing machine talks loudest about the blockbuster. It’s an exciting time for film.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Are films really getting longer?

1/8/2022,"The archbishop of Canterbury has called for a new “covenant” on social care between the state and the people, similar to the provision of the NHS and education, which makes “absolute value and dignity” the top priority. Justin Welby, the leader of the Church of England, said that focusing on managing the cost of social care, a priority in the latest government reforms, is “the wrong way round” because it fails to consider what people who need care want.  “You start with the value of the human being,” Welby said. “Then you say, ‘what is the consequence of that? [in terms of the care system]’. We did that for the health service. We haven’t done that for social care.” He called for a deal that would make the best possible care for all “a national obligation”. Welby was speaking out before a parliamentary battle over the funding of social care. A new tax and a cap on care costs to prevent most people from having to sell their homes are at the heart of the government’s proposed reforms of the sector, which affect 11 million people in the UK as carers or care recipients. Ministers have resisted calls from MPs, care experts and the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt to inject at least £7bn a year in new money to stabilise social care after nearly two years of crisis, with the pandemic leaving parts of the system in collapse. Scotland is pursuing a different approach and is consulting on setting up a new National Care Service. The archbishop said: “There isn’t a clear vision for care. We know the vision for the NHS: ‘free care at the point of use’. You can sum it up in a sentence … We keep putting the cart before the horse. We keep talking about how we are going to pay for it when we don’t really know what we want to pay for.” The House of Lords, in which Welby sits, will soon consider plans for financing the cap on social care. Under the government plans poorer people will lose a larger proportion of their wealth than richer people and their homes may still be sold to finance their care. The upper chamber is expected to demand changes to the proposal that has been labelled unfair. Welby is pressing for a more profound reform. “You have to have a covenantal approach which says regardless of who you are, of your economic value, of your utility, society covenants to give you the best possible care it can as you approach the end of your life,” he said. That means making social care “a community obligation, not just a family obligation”. Welby’s father-in-law lived with him and his wife for the last year of his life, with his wife, who trained as a teacher, spending many years caring for him. Their daughter receives care funded by a carer’s allowance, and lives with them. “If it is just a family obligation it is totally unjust because poorer families, families struggling to make ends meet, families with significant debt simply will feel guilty,” Welby said. “We have got to get rid of the guilt. It is a community obligation. We have done that in health and education, we need to do that with social care. It is a national obligation, expressed by the state. The state at the very least has to underwrite that covenant, as it does with health.” Welby and the archbishop of York have commissioned a review of social care to examine the wishes and needs of people who use it, which will report back in the spring. The Archbishops’ Commission on Reimagining Care is chaired by Dr Anna Dixon. She said: “The care system is not enabling people to live a full life. People are not being supported to live the lives that they want or any of us would choose for ourselves.” The commission has produced a list of values to underpin a future vision of care. They “include concepts that are not usually heard in policy discussions about care, such as flourishing, loving kindness, empathy, trust and justice”. “This affects all of us,” Dixon said. “At one time or another we are needing care or providing care. We have got to get away from seeing this [as a] thing that happens to someone else.” Welby said that often when discussions about someone’s end of life care focus on cost “my colleagues who work with me here [at Lambeth Palace] from Africa and the global south just find that incomprehensible. They start with saying they are very special.” He added that in the UK people don’t like to talk about the final stages of ageing. “We jump from being a respected elder, who is independent and able, and we close our eyes to the next stage, Shakespeare’s sixth and seventh age of man … the next thing you have is the obituary,” he said. “We leave out the bit between being competent and the obituary.” “There is a point at which our individual autonomy is lost but we are still alive,” he said. “At that point in a really healthy society, the community says because we love you and value you as an individual we will ensure the maximum possible dignity and care in this period, whether it be long or short.”",News/Society,"Provide social care on par with education or NHS, says Justin Welby",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/07/provide-social-care-on-par-with-nhs-or-education-says-justin-welby
1/8/2022,"There comes a point on every Ashes tour when even the most ardent England fan has to ask whether the cricket is worth getting out of bed for. It’s a complex set of calculations in which you have to weigh the score in the series and the state of the game, the likelihood of the team being humiliated again, the ambient temperature of the bedroom, the distance to the TV, the hour, and whatever you’ve got on the next day. Exhaustion multiplied by dejection divided by hope. Whatever the answer is, it absolutely isn’t 36 for four off 21.5 overs, 3-0 down in the series, 380 runs behind in the match, at three in the morning. That’s the time to make like the team have been, and roll over.  And then Pat Cummins overstepped. It was his first called no-ball of the series. He missed his length and Ben Stokes smacked the ball back for four down the ground. That ended a stretch in which England, lost in the doldrums, had scored one run off 76 balls. Two balls later, he pulled four more, through square leg. It was the first twitch of resistance, the throbbing vein on the forehead of a man who, like all the rest of us, has had just about enough. In the next Cummins over, Stokes was nearly caught-and-bowled, in the over after that, Jonny Bairstow was almost caught at slip. And then something truly extraordinary happened. Cameron Green, bowling from around the wicket, fooled Stokes into shouldering his bat to a delivery that slanted in and hit his off-stump. But the bail barely moved, and the ball carried on through to the keeper. Stokes has never come across as a devout sort, but this freakish bit of good fortune felt like a sign of divine intervention, a finger on the scale, a thumb on the bail. All the luck England had missed in the first three Tests served up to him in one dollop. He grinned. And like all good god-fearing men came to the obvious conclusion that, today, at least, providence was with him. So fuck it. He uppercut Green over the slips, then clipped him through midwicket. Something was stirring. You could feel it. We’ve seen too little of this Stokes lately, while he has been labouring away on his best impression of a prim and proper top-order batsman, block, block, block. This was the Stokes who clears bars and empties beds. It was time to dash to the living room. In the next over Green smacked Stokes hard on the bottom hand. He was already in obvious pain, grimacing because of his side strain, but the wounds only seemed to harden him, as if battle had sharpened his instincts. Sometimes it happens like that. They always said Gordon Greenidge was more dangerous on one leg. Cummins brought on Mitchell Starc. Stokes hit him for one four through long-on, another through long-off, and another through midwicket. He came out of his crease to play Scott Boland, drove him hard through cover for four, and whipped him to square leg for three, a shot that brought up his fifty, England’s sixth of the tour, and the first by anyone other than Joe Root and Dawid Malan. And where he went, Bairstow followed. Early in his innings you could almost see Bairstow sheltering in his lee, he had four from his first 18 balls, 17 from his first 46, but as Stokes’ confidence grew, Bairstow’s did too. By the time Stokes was closing on his fifty, Bairstow was, for the first time in years, back batting at his best in a Test match. The muddled and messy player who has spent the last two years scratching around, in and out of the team, had turned back into the crisp, bristling batsman who looked so good when scored all those runs, and set all those records, in 2016. It was a masterful innings, especially in the way he cut and swept Nathan Lyon, and expertly measured. He accelerated his pace after he passed fifty and slowed again as he neared his hundred. There are all sorts of ways to talk about Bairstow’s innings, you could look at the data, which showed how he had doggedly blocked everything the seamers bowled him around the top of off, or the technique, and the way in which he switched his guard after he had passed fifty so was finally able to marry his white ball game with the demands of Test match cricket. But Bairstow chose to frame it in terms of the character he showed, especially after, like Stokes, he was wounded by a vicious blow that did serious damage to his bottom hand. “It’s about gritting your teeth and getting stuck in,” he said. “You’ve got to dig deep, these are the times you look at yourself and say: ‘What am I about and where do I come from? What’s the bit in the tank that keeps you coming back?’ I’d like to think that in 20 years time when I’m sat over a pint they’re the moments I’d like to look back on, and say: ‘When did you stand up? When did you front up for the other 10 blokes in the dressing room?’” There are lessons there, for the other batsmen in the team, yes, but for the management, too. Character isn’t a question of scheduling, or “systemic change”, it comes from the culture of the team, which comes, in turn, from the leadership. There was a ringing clarity about the way Stokes and Bairstow played, what they wanted to do and how they planned to do it, which was at complete odds with the confusion which has dogged England’s Test team, and their own careers, for the last few years. England have still lost the Ashes. England are still losing this game. But they showed they’re still worth getting up for, and gave a glimpse of how they might move forward, too.",Sport/Sport,Stokes and Bairstow show why England are still worth waking up for | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/07/stokes-and-bairstow-show-why-england-are-still-worth-waking-up-for
1/8/2022,"What is the problem with how we help elderly and disabled people? The quality of life of social care recipients in England is a lottery based on their council area, wealth and the availability of family to offer unpaid care. Social care is means tested and councils do not pay enough to care operators to cover the cost of state-funded recipients, so private funders in effect subsidise them. Standards and availability of care are patchy, families end up bearing a huge burden and people occupy NHS hospital beds when they could be helped in the community. Funding for people who need social care stands at around £20bn a year compared with £135bn for the NHS, and the population is ageing.  Underwriting social care more fully and setting it alongside education and the NHS as a public good requires, in the archbishop’s words, making it “a national obligation, expressed by the state”. That would need wider public acceptance of the merit of improving the quality of life for people nearing the end of their lives, or who are disabled, perhaps by emphasising basic values such as kindness, empathy and justice. Far from everyone will need social care, so a broader state commitment to providing better care is likely to need to be sold by politicians as an insurance policy for all. Its policy announcements have focused more on personal finances than quality of life. The reason for capping care costs at £86,000 was explained as preventing people having to sell their homes, or in most cases, their children losing a valuable part of their inheritance. Chronic shortages of care staff, which mean about 400,000 people are awaiting care packages or assessments in England, can only be addressed with resources of an additional £7-£10bn a year, experts say. Nowhere near that amount is being offered. The social care white paper, which sets out a 10-year vision, includes elements that could overlap with Welby’s hopes. It talks about increasing housing options and spreading innovative community models of care so there is no longer a binary choice between struggling on at home or going into a care home. More intermediate assisted-living options are to be encouraged. This approach could help those who advocate building elderly care into new housing estates and linking care homes with schools to keep the old and young together. A gentler slope between healthy adulthood and death is hoped for.",News/Society,A social care ‘covenant’: how might archbishop’s plan work? ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/07/a-social-care-covenant-how-might-archbishops-plan-work
1/8/2022,"Sainsbury’s is increasing hourly pay by more than 12% for grocery delivery drivers and more than 5% for its lowest paid shop workers as staff shortages continue to affect British businesses. Basic pay for shop workers, at Sainsbury’s supermarkets and the Argos catalogue chain, will rise to a minimum of £10 an hour from the current £9.50 from 6 March. The company said the change would cost £100m.  Grocery delivery drivers’ pay will rise to £11.50 an hour, including a 75p short-term premium on top of a 75p booster already being paid. Argos drivers will receive an extra 25p an hour on top of basic pay in addition to a 75p supplement, taking their total to £11 an hour. Sainsbury’s staff will also get a 15% discount in stores for five days around each payday. Argos, Sainsbury’s and Habitat staff will continue to get a 10% discount at other times. The new rates of pay exceed the legal minimum wage for people aged 25 and older, which rises from £8.91 to £9.50 an hour from April. Dave Gill, the national officer at the Usdaw union, welcomed the increase after lengthy negotiations. “It’s been a tough time for food retail staff who have worked throughout the pandemic in difficult circumstances … they deserve decent pay and this offer is a welcome boost,” he said. Sainsbury’s is being forced to act as retailers and other businesses battle for staff amid widespread shortages that are driving up wages and the price of goods. Some companies, including Tesco and Asda, have been offering qualified lorry drivers signing-on bonuses of £1,000 or more. But shortages extend to warehouse staff and van drivers, while shops are also under pressure as the spread of the Omicron Covid variant has forced millions to take time off. Greggs bakery chain said on Thursday that it had brought forward pay rises for workers by five months so they were received before Christmas amid “continued disruption to staffing and supply chains”. The company also said it had put up the price of its baked goods by 5-10p each because of increased costs including wages. Next said it was also having to put up the price of its clothing by as much as 6% this autumn as the fashion and homewares retailer expected average wages to rise by more than 5% this year. Lidl announced in November that it would increase minimum pay from £9.50 to £10.10 an hour outside of London, a more than 6% increase, from March and £10.85 to £11.30 within the M25. Workers at the discounter can earn up to £12.25 an hour in London depending on length of service. However, last month that was topped by Aldi, which increased its minimum hourly rates for shop workers to £10.57 an hour from £9.55 nationally, a near 11% rise, and £11.32 in Greater London from £11.07. Aldi is one of the few retailers to continue to pay staff for break times, making its overall pay deal even more generous. Simon Roberts, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s said: “We are making this significant investment to show our colleagues how much we value the brilliant job they do for our customers every day. It also reflects the significant progress we are making against our plan and to save money we can invest in lower prices, offer fantastic colleague service and make shopping convenient for customers.”",News/Business,Sainsbury’s to increase shop workers’ pay to at least £10 an hour,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/07/sainsburys-pay-increase-store-staff-drivers-shop-workers
1/8/2022,"Joe Biden marked the first anniversary of 6 January with a powerful, ideological speech about the choice between democracy and autocracy. It began a day of reflection in which Democratic Congress members and police officers spoke of the fear they felt for their lives. Every major news network opted for somber programming and roundtable discussions about the fragile nature of American democracy.  Except for one. Fox News’s primetime lineup of rightwing hosts used rock guitar licks to introduce a different narrative: one of hysterical Democrats “jilling up noise” and crying “crocodile tears”. Hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham pushed conspiracy theories that undercover FBI agents or Capitol police were responsible for the breach of the Capitol and spent most of the night claiming Congress should be focused on investigating the “real rioters”, Black Lives Matter protesters. Carlson began his show in incendiary style. While Biden and the press agreed 6 January was one of the most significant dates in recent history, Carlson said it “barely rates as a footnote”, arguing that because “not a single elected official was killed” and “none of the insurrectionists had guns” that the effort to overthrow the government was “embarrassingly tepid”. “Not a lot happened that day,” he said in an almost disappointed tone. He said he accepted it was a riot, “but really only just a riot, maybe just barely”. In a night of endless false equivalencies, Carlson got his in early. Was what happened on 6 January a greater risk to America than inflation? Why were the protesters rotting in jail while the Sacklers walk free? Why were “unarmed protesters” being demonized? If he had watched the day’s coverage on any other channel, Carlson would have seen that investigations and video evidence have proven that the Capitol mob was incredibly violent. Objects used to attack police officers included bricks, pepper spray, pipes, bats and Tasers. Prosecutors have charged 187 of the rioters with violent acts. Michael Fanone, a Metropolitan police department officer who voted for Trump in 2016, was shocked on his neck with a Taser several times, which led to a heart attack. Rioters threatened to take his weapon and shoot him with it, shouting “Kill him with his own gun!” Threats to life were not mentioned by the three hosts. Instead Carlson quickly moved on to conspiracy theories, in particular his baseless claim that riots were stoked by Ray Epps, a Trump supporter from Arizona who Carlson falsely believes is an undercover FBI agent. He showed clips from his documentary series Patriot Purge which led to the resignation of two Fox News contributors who said the documentary was “incoherent conspiracy-mongering”. But his biggest strut was to invite Senator Ted Cruz on the program, who on Wednesday had accurately described 6 January as “a violent terrorist attack”. Carlson was appalled at this language and demanded that Cruz explain himself. Cruz first attempted to wheedle his way out, calling his choice of words “sloppy and dumb” but Carlson continued to berate him, making him walk back and continually apologize for his language. Carlson was dishing out a humiliation, reminding Cruz of his status as a Republican kingmaker. As a final punishment Carlson asked Cruz what he thought about Ray Epps, pushing him to join him in a nonsense conspiracy theory, which Cruz did for the first time, saying “for [Epps] to appear on the FBI’s most wanted list and come off it certainly suggests he was working for the FBI. That’s not conclusive, but that’s the obvious implication.” Later in the evening, Sean Hannity took the baton railing against the “rank hypocrisy”, “lying” and “grandstanding” by the Democrats – ignoring the hypocrisy that his on-screen opinions are entirely opposed to the feelings he shared with the Trump administration as the attack was taking place. Hannity called Biden a liar, playing a clip from his speech in which he says that Donald Trump did nothing during the attack but watch TV. But Hannity’s own texts, revealed by the congressional committee investigating the attack, show he was perturbed by the former president’s lack of action on that day. Hannity’s texts at the time show he was “very worried about the next 48 hours”, that he begged the chief of staff that Trump “make a statement” and “ask people to leave the Capitol” and that Trump “can’t mention the election again. Ever.” Hannity has repeated Trump’s lie that the election was rigged almost daily since November. Instead of a mea culpa, Hannity claimed Trump had wanted to send 10,000 national guard troops to protect the Capitol and was blocked from getting them by the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. This has been disproven. He made no direct order and was not concerned about securing the Capitol. The night finished with Ingraham returning to the network’s central theme, that Black Lives Matter protesters were to blame for the real violence. “If the Democrats were truly worried about political violence, they would have condemned it in summer of 2020,” she told her viewers. Ingraham’s own texts, also revealed by the committee, show too she was deeply worried about political violence on 6 January. She texted the White House chief of staff saying, “Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol this is hurting all of us – he is destroying his legacy”.",News/Media,Fox News goes through the looking-glass on US Capitol attack anniversary,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/07/fox-news-6-january-capitol-attack-tucker-carlson-sean-hannity-laura-ingraham
1/8/2022,"My son is 30 and a lawyer. He is ambitious and enthusiastic, but he’s now in his fourth job, and already wants to leave after just a few months. When he starts a new job, he is generally happy, but within a short time he realises there’s a gap between the job description and the reality, and wants to get out because he feels he’s wasting his time. He says the problems he encounters are poor management and bad organisation.  Although I think each time he has good reasons to resign, I try to suggest that there might be something in him – his expectations, his choices – which could explain that “pattern”. In his current job he resents his young superior’s constant rewriting of his contracts, mostly for minor grammatical details. He acknowledges that she is neither harassing him nor ill-intentioned. His older sister (also a lawyer) sees nothing wrong in his boss’s behaviour. My son dismisses her help and thinks that she’s too “submissive”. I told him recently that he can’t have it all. That it could never be perfect, just like in a relationship. I would very much have liked to know what your son was like as a young boy. Could he take criticism? How was he with authority? He seems to struggle with seeing others’ point of view, or thinking he’s never wrong. My specialist this week, psychotherapist Chris Mills, thought you sounded really sensible. You could see that there was a problem but realised that this may be down to your son’s attitude. “In a way,” said Mills, “your son’s fighting off admitting he has a problem, so he’s making the problem literally anybody else’s.” What might this problem be? “For all that your son does brilliantly, he can’t seem to grasp that he can’t relate well to other people; if he could just admit that, it would transform his relationships and his working life would be more bearable.” The people around him seem to see this, yet he doesn’t. “He reminds me of students I used to work with who never failed at anything and it made them incredibly fragile,” says Mills. “Failure, which is entirely ordinary, becomes terrifying to those who aren’t used to it. Sometimes people who are super intelligent find it incredibly difficult to adjust to the ordinariness of the everyday, which is full of people getting things wrong and disagreeing with you.” Mills further pointed out that success in everyday life is “being able to deal with that failure and not expecting life to be tidy or linear”. We also thought it was interesting that he comes to talk to you. Mills thought it seemed slightly immature – that your son felt that only his mum really understood him. I think you’re doing all the right things in bringing a bit of ordinariness to his complaints, and asking him to look at his own role in things. I know people like this: they leave job after job (or relationship, an interesting parallel you made there), never looking at the common denominator in all of it: themselves. We learn by our failures and they help us develop. Acknowledging our failures is a strength, but only if we can see them as our failures, and not attribute them to others.

1/8/2022,"As the first half of his fifth album draws to close with a track called Here We Go … Again – a beautiful, beatless ballad blessed with a chord progression that recalls the Love Unlimited Orchestra’s sublime 1973 hit Love’s Theme – Abel Tesfaye allows himself a moment of self-congratulation. He hymns his appearance on the cover of Billboard magazine at the start of last year, suited and booted, smoking a cigar, surrounded by his “kinfolk”: “Catalogue looking legendary … now we’re cruising on a yacht, we clear.” By the end of last year, Tesfaye – or rather his alter ego, the Weeknd – was on the cover of Billboard again, accompanying a feature that offered an oral history of the making of Dawn FM’s predecessor, After Hours. Complete with quotes from friends, producers, record company bosses and the tailor who made the suits he wore in the videos, it was the kind of celebration that normally appears in heritage rock magazines and is reserved for august classic albums. But then, After Hours’ biggest hit, Blinding Lights, had just dethroned Chubby Checker’s deathless 1962 smash The Twist as the top Billboard 100 single of all time, a designation based on total weeks on the US chart and the positions held during that time.  He was already vastly successful before After Hours came out but the triumph of Blinding Lights – its combination of melancholy and dancefloor propulsion the perfect complement to the misery and yearning for escapism engendered by the pandemic – elevated Tesfaye to even more rarified heights. And Dawn FM is very much the sort of thing you might release had you recently been officially crowned an all-time great. It’s a concept album of sorts, with some lofty ideas about the afterlife that seem to be bound up with current affairs and informed by lockdown. “You’ve been in the dark for way too long, it’s time to step into the light,” offers the opening title track, while its description of what awaits us in the hereafter (“now that all future plans have been postponed”) could just as easily be a description of the hedonistic nirvana of the dancefloor: “Soon you’ll be healed, forgiven and refreshed, free from all trauma, pain, guilt and shame – you may even forget your name.” The album comes studded with star guests that say something about its author’s status. The inter-track narration is provided by Jim Carrey; Quincy Jones rocks up six tracks in, discussing his mother’s mental illness and the effect it had on his relationships; Here We Go… Again improbably unites Tyler, the Creator and 79-year-old Beach Boy Bruce Johnston; the production team pitches together Max Martin, Swedish House Mafia and leftfield electronic auteur Oneohtrix Point Never. And its references seem to place its author in a lineage of musical greats: aside from Here We Go… Again’s suggestion of Barry White, the concluding Phantom Regret By Jim nods to both Prince and Marc Bolan. But the most noticeable thing about Dawn FM is how effortless and confident it feels, as if Tesfaye has been bolstered rather than cowed by its predecessor’s success. Brilliantly written, produced and sung, it offers the captivating sound of an artist who knows he’s at the top of his game, at a blissful point at which every melody sticks, and every production idea works just so. It doesn’t bother cravenly chasing the success of Blinding Lights – although Less Than Zero, which marries that track’s clipped beat and retro electronics to an acoustic guitar and perfect chorus, is a huge hit single in waiting. And it delves further into the fascination with the 80s that Tesfaye first explored on the mixtapes that kickstarted his career, with their samples of Bad-era Michael Jackson and Kaleidoscope-era Siouxsie and the Banshees. This interest finds its expression throughout, from a second half entirely consisting of mid-tempo tracks influenced by 80s R&B – uniformly stunning songs that never slip into pastiche – to the title of Less Than Zero (presumably a reference to Brett Easton Ellis’s epochal 1985 novel of moneyed, coke-numbed indifference, rather than the Elvis Costello song about Oswald Mosley from which the book swiped its name). Indeed, Tesfaye’s interest in the era of the “second British invasion” is such that he occasionally communicates icy hauteur by slipping into an English accent, which ranges from mild intonation to what you might call the full Dick Van Dyke, on Don’t Break My Heart and Gasoline. That is a rare jarring moment on an album so well done that it’s hard to pick out highlights, although Out of Time is a particularly gorgeous ballad, and the moment when the wracked electro of How Do I Make You Love Me? segues into Take My Breath – five and half euphoric minutes of disco-house, with a riff that recalls Daft Punk’s Da Funk – is pulse-quickening. Students of the often vexed relationship between pop stars and the personae they inhabit may note that, after the Weeknd was depicted bloodied and bandaged on his last album cover, Dawn FM pictures him prematurely wizened and grey, as if his past excesses have caught up with him. Quite what that image is supposed to mean isn’t clear but someone minded to pick holes might suggest that the lyrics that stick to the Weeknd’s classic subjects – creepy abusive relationships, overconsumption and jaded small-hours decadence – are starting to sound as old as the character looks. The one flaw in Dawn FM is that the imagery in the album’s opening tracks feels very well-worn: “I wrap my hands around your throat you love it when I always squeeze”; “It’s 5am, I’m nihilist”; “You’re offering yourself to me like a sacrifice”, etc, etc. Then again, maybe it’s meant to signify maturity born out of bitter experience. There’s a certain narrative arc to the songs, independent of the stuff about the afterlife, that sees the Weeknd go from erotic asphyxiation and hoofing up drugs to feeling wounded that one of his conquests is cheating on her husband with him (“I heard you’re married, girl, and I hate it,” he sings, the negative image of the cokey hedonism of I Can’t Feel My Face), then pleading for affection and panicking that he’s stuck: “I don’t want to be a prisoner to who I used to be”. Perhaps it’s supposed to be taken in conjunction with the album’s afterlife theme, a suggestion that the character is reaching the end of the line and that Tesfaye – who has talked in interviews about wanting to “remove the Weeknd from the world” – intends to move on. If that’s true, Dawn FM is a fantastic way to bow out: 2020s pop music so brilliantly crafted that it causes you to realise how much other 2020s pop music is makeweight.",Arts/Music,The Weeknd: Dawn FM review – a stunning display of absolute pop prowess,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/07/the-weeknd-dawn-fm-review
