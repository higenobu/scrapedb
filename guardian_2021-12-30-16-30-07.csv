12/30/2021,"Federal, state and territory leaders have met to agree on a uniform definition of what makes a close contact at a snap meeting of the national cabinet on Thursday, implementing new rules for how people are to isolate and when they should get tested. Speaking to reporters afterwards, Scott Morrison said Omicron was a “game changer” that has “overtaken the country in just a month” and required a “reset”.   Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Omicron requires us to undertake a change of how we are managing the pandemic, and we need to reset how we think about the pandemic, and how we manage ourselves and the things we need to do as governments,” the prime minister said. As case numbers skyrocket and queues for testing grow, the changes are designed to take the pressure off PCR testing and limit the amount of time people spend out of the workforce if they are not seriously ill. Previously there was no agreed definition between the various states and territories, but the main thrust of the uniform rule is to reduce the number of people defined as a close contact and do away entirely with the concept of a “casual contact”. “Except in exceptional circumstances, a close contact is a household contact or ‘household-like’ of a confirmed case only. A household contact is someone who lives with a case or has spent more than four hours with them in a house, accommodation or care facility setting,” Morrison said. The change is similar to what had been flagged in recent days and also includes residential care facilities as a “household-like” setting. Morrison was at pains to point out that it only applied to contact with a “confirmed case”, that is, someone who had received a positive PCR test. “So, you are only a close contact if you are effectively living with someone or have been in an accommodation setting for more than four hours with someone who has actually got Covid – not someone who is in contact with someone who has had Covid,” he said. Those who meet this definition will then have to isolate and test – though when to test and how to test has also changed. Anyone with symptoms should get a PCR test. Under the new arrangement, a confirmed case must isolate for seven days from the date their infection was confirmed with a test. On day six, they need to return a negative result on a rapid antigen test before they can leave isolation. Someone who discovers they are a close contact but is not showing any symptoms must test with a rapid antigen test. If the test is positive, they must then have a PCR test. If that comes back positive, the person obviously becomes a confirmed case themselves. A close contact who returns a negative test must still isolate for seven days from the date of exposure, as symptoms may still show. On day six, they can take a rapid antigen test, and may leave isolation if it is negative. The exception is in South Australia, which, while adopting the definition, will still require a 10-day isolation period. “What this does is significantly change those who need to be going and getting in a queue,” Morrison said. No – unless you are a close contact or have symptoms, you will not be able to get a free PCR test in the way that has been normal practice for the past two years. Morrison made clear the intention was to reduce the number of people in queues for PCR tests, although it is unclear how many of those people fall into the category of what he called “the worried well”. “If you don’t fulfil this definition of a close contact then there is no need for you to be in that line,” Morrison said. “You should go home. Go to the beach, go and do what you want to do. Read a book in the park. Follow all the normal, commonsense things that you would do, monitor your symptoms, follow the Covid-safe practices, make sure you have booked for your booster, do all of those sorts of things – but there is no need for you to be in that line.” Those people of course can still take a rapid antigen test bought over the counter from a supermarket or pharmacy, but Morrison made clear RATs would only be provided free under certain specific circumstances at state hubs. From midnight on Thursday, in all states and territories except Tasmania, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Tasmania will adopt the change from 1 January, while the Northern Territory and Western Australia will make separate announcements in the coming days. Morrison confirmed that the changes will apply to people currently in isolation when it comes into force from midnight and that people currently isolating who do not meet the new definition may leave. “Let them out,” he said. Testing sites on the east coast and in South Australia have been swamped, causing immense queues to be tested and delaying results in some cases for many days. In many parts of the country rapid antigen tests have also been in short supply. Morrison said the change was needed to relieve pressure on testing sites and allow health workers and others to return to their jobs more quickly. “This should significantly, we hope, over the next few weeks, greatly reduce the volume of people who are having these PCR tests, which means we will be able to increase the turnaround time of these tests, getting results back to those who need to take them,” he said. “In addition to that, it will also free up, we hope, a lot more workforce that is currently being focused on these tests to be able to be supporting the other priorities for managing the pandemic.” The president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Omar Khorsid, raised concerns in a series of posts on social media, saying that the change will make the situation worse. “Redefining close contacts will simply accelerate the outbreak,” he said. “I don’t think you could call the NSW experiment a success yet.” I’m confused @ScottMorrisonMP Omicron spreads more easily than any other variant. It doesn’t care if you are a family member, a coworker, a drinker in the pub or breathing the same air in a lift. Isolating close contacts slows spread. Isolating less people means faster spread. In an AMA statement, Khorsid added: “The change will help to preserve testing capacity and should limit the number of furloughed health workers, but it will come at the cost of accelerating the outbreak. “It seems national cabinet is prepared to bet that a massive Omicron outbreak won’t cause large numbers of hospitalisations. Whilst initial data is encouraging, we expect hospitalisations to rise in coming weeks simply due to the very large number of cases, which will be far larger than the positive tests indicate, due to today’s decision.” He also questioned the decision to forgo some PCR testing. “The use of RATs for asymptomatic close contacts rather than PCR tests is questionable and PCRs should continue to be used if possible, given their superior accuracy for asymptomatic cases,” Khorshid said. OzSage, a group of independent experts who have organised to provide advice to government on management of the pandemic, warned before the announcement that the changes as outlined in advance were not “based on sound public health principles”. “Close contact definitions need to be based on risk,” it said in a statement. “Risk is related to the amount of exposure to virus-laden aerosols. Risk is not limited to arbitrary four-hour time frames within households. “Settings like nightclubs and restaurants have been sites of superspreading events, and if people exposed in these settings cannot get a PCR test, spread will accelerate.” OzSage said relying on individuals to self-test with rapid antigen tests and self-manage their symptoms meant governments would not have a true picture of how many cases are in the community.",News/Australia news,"What are the new rules in Australia on Covid isolation, close contacts and testing?",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/30/what-are-the-new-rules-in-australia-on-covid-isolation-close-contacts-and-testing
12/30/2021," Makwa (Phoenix Wilson) may smoke cigarettes and wear a tough-guy leather jacket, but his face betrays the soft, doughy features of a preteen boy. Alternately neglected and beaten by his father, he’s an emotionally inarticulate knot of coiled rage. Cruelty is learned behaviour. The idea, that those who experience trauma are destined to repeat the cycle, is at the centre of the sinewy debut feature from Indigenous American writer-director Lyle Mitchell Corbine Jr. In the film, Makwa, a young Ojibwe boy living on a reservation in Wisconsin, commits a violent crime and escapes the consequences. When we revisit him as an adult, this time portrayed with icy detachment by a transfixing Michael Greyeyes, he’s reinvented himself. Living in Los Angeles, with an office job and a blonde wife, he’s attempted to scrub himself of the culture he grew up around. But generational trauma leaves a stain. Simran Hans Despite significant critical praise during the 2020 festival circuit and executive producer Alfonso Cuarón’s stamp, Chaitanya Tamhane’s The Disciple was just another drop in Netflix’s content tsunami this year, and failed to get the attention it deserved. There’s some art-reflecting-life here, as it depicts the struggle between art and commerce, and how absolute dedication to one’s craft can lead to a life of sacrifice and frustration. Though this may sound like a downer, the journey is absolutely mesmerizing. Much of that is thanks to the specific art our young lead (Aditya Modak) is trying to master: a very demanding form of Hindustani classical music. The best scenes are of Modak’s frequent hazy nighttime motorcycle rides through Mumbai, listening to tapes of an ascetic master under tanpura drones. The Disciple ultimately confronts movie cliches of hard work and triumph versus the victory of self-preservation, with an unpredictable, volcanic ending. Jordan Hoffman Deragh Campbell is a magnetic force playing a character who tends to push people in the other direction. Her Anne is a woman in crisis in Canadian film-maker Kazik Radwanski’s humble but exhilarating portrait, which has already drawn deserved comparisons to Cassavetes and the Dardennes’ for its unadorned, realist and undeniably affectionate approach to the kind of person who is often intentionally ignored. In loose and humble vignettes, Anne tries keeping turbulent emotions in check while holding a job at a daycare, entertaining a new boyfriend and being present for her friend’s wedding. She’s also training for a skydiving excursion that delivers a not-so-subtle but still moving metaphor for the character’s state of mind. She’s flapping through life like a bird spiralling out, propelled in circles by the competing urges to hide in a corner and finally be seen. Meanwhile, Radwanski keeps the camera at a suffocating distance from his brilliant collaborator’s face, as if to make it impossible for us to look away. Radheyan Simonpillai Few films have captured the shifting tides of sexual abuse’s aftermath as thoroughly, and singed me as deeply, as Groomed. The Discovery+ documentary proceeds in two registers: certainty, in accounting the methodical process of grooming, and eddying ambiguity, in film-maker Gwen van de Pas’s understanding of her memories as a 12-year-old in a sexual relationship with her 20-something swim coach. In one of the most searing scenes I have ever witnessed, Van de Pas returns to her childhood bedroom in Holland in search of his letters to her. The stew of emotions – fear that the contents will confuse her, desperation for evidence – is palpable and devastating. Even more so are the real-time rationalizations of her groomed psyche when she, to her adult horror, finds the graphically sexual letters. Not every part of Groomed works, but the film’s revelatory vulnerability illustrates how self-undermining confusion is the long and deliberate tail of abuse, not a personal failure to see clearly or a repudiation of what happened. Adrian Horton There was only room for one great, Mads Mikkelsen-led, Danish movie this year: the Oscar-winning Another Round. Which is a shame because there were two of them. Riders of Justice could easily be mistaken for a Taken-style revenge thriller at first glance; in fact it’s a deconstruction of the whole genre – a dazzlingly smart mix of screwball comedy, therapeutic drama, metaphysical enquiry and, yes, violent action. Mikkelsen plays a grizzled Afghanistan vet whose wife is killed in a train crash, leaving him to raise their teenage daughter (badly, he’s an emotional black hole). Things become interesting when he meets a trio of dysfunctional tech geeks (Nikolaj Lie Kaas, Lars Brygmann and Nicolas Bro), who believe the crash was not an accident. That’s just the set-up. Wayward, unpredictable and often hilarious, it’s one of those stories that seems to be all over the place but somehow comes together beautifully – like a vintage Coen brothers caper. Oh, and it’s a Christmas movie. Steve Rose Mona Fastvold came to feature directing via acting and screenwriting (with her partner Brady Corbet), before making her feature debut The Sleepwalker. Her second feature, the gorgeously literary romance The World to Come, displays her confident, compelling style. The film is based on a Jim Shepard short story, and the scene is set in the ravishing landscapes and inhospitable climate of mid-19th-century rural New York. Farmer’s wife, Abigail (Katherine Waterston) and her new neighbour Tallie (Vanessa Kirby) who become instant friends, and then more cautiously lovers. The doomed-love scenario may feel a little familiar, but there’s a freshness about this film, which feels alive to the “astonishment and joy” that the romantic leads discover so suddenly. Waterston and Kirby are excellent at skirting the maudlin to something more meaningful in this clandestine affair. Credit too, should go to Daniel Blumberg’s arresting score and the invigorating imagery created by Andre Chemetoff’s photography. Pamela Hutchinson A table of kindly Japanese grandmothers exchanging pleasantries over lunch in the present turns out to have been preternaturally talented athletes who galvanized a country half a century earlier. In the 1950s and 60s a team of textile factory workers strung together a stunning 258-game winning streak – including a world championship and Olympic gold – while sparking a craze in volleyball manga and anime in Japan and beyond. Julien Faraut’s documentary The Witches of the Orient conjures an intoxicating brew of archival sports footage and that vintage anime, with electronic music underscoring the repetitive, mesmerizing quality of both factory work and relentless drills by a near-fanatical coach. The film culminates with the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, a display of reemergence for Japan after the horrors of World War II and the first to include volleyball. It’s a marvelous, inspirational tale of resilience, hard work and determination, told by the athletes themselves with an assist from Faraut’s deft editing, anime-inspired touches and fantastic music choices. Lisa Wong Macabasco In a year of hand-wringing “but what does this mean for Hollywood?” flops, not many films crashed, burned and then totally disappeared with as much of a stink as Ridley Scott’s starry $100m epic The Last Duel. Audiences stayed away en masse (it stumbled to just $30m worldwide) and its Oscar chances dramatically crumbled (Disney hasn’t even bothered with a campaign) but there’s something far smarter and more subversive than one would expect here, something that should have had everyone talking on release rather than the stinging silence it instead inspired. There’s been a slowly increasing number of more recent period films that have nobly tried to attach a more contemporary lens to stories traditionally told in binary, male-skewed terms but few, if any, have managed to do this quite as effectively. It’s the grim tale of Marguerite de Carrouges (a standout Jodie Comer), a woman labelled a liar for accusing a French squire (an odious Adam Driver) of rape and through shifting perspectives, we see that not only is she telling the truth but that every man around her, including grotesque husband (a vile Matt Damon), is using her for something. The film acts as a knowing corrective not only to how history has written Marguerite’s story (an accusatory question mark has been attached to her telling of sexual assault for centuries) but also to a genre of films that has unfailingly valorised men and diminished women (no film in 2021 has been as fully committed to such a depressing “men are trash” worldview). It’s fascinatingly dour yet utterly believable. Benjamin Lee The Mexican cinema scene is not entirely dominated by alpha males like Guillermo del Toro, Alfonso Cuarón and Alejandro González Iñárittu. The year’s most criminally underseen film was the haunting Mexican drama Identifying Features from first-time feature director Fernanda Valadez and her co-producer, co-writer and co-editor Astrid Rondero. It’s about a middle-aged woman from central Mexico who sets out on a journey to find out what happened to the teenage son who left home to try getting into the US: it’s developed from their 2013 short 400 Bags, and inspired by the horrific 2011 San Fernando massacre in which hundreds of desperate people were kidnapped by drug cartels from passenger buses in the borderlands. The movie has heartbreak and a vision of real evil: it is something like social-realist folk horror, though it unapologetically invokes the image of Satan with an absolute seriousness which sets it apart from the horror genre. It is a cry for help and a cry of rage: deeply engaged cinema. Peter Bradshaw There’s clearly a ton of underseen documentaries out there, of all shapes and sizes, but my attention was drawn to this Romanian documentary, which in a strange way is a companion piece to the amazing 2019 film Collective. It’s a beautifully shot and tremendously moving film about a Roma family living wild outside Bucharest, who are then forced into the city to ensure the kids get an education – it encapsulates the pros and cons of the super-emotive topic of off grid living and the limits of state control. The kicker? The apparently heartless government types pushing the family off their land are the same administration as the good guys in Collective. Andrew Pulver Not content with directing one of the year’s best films in Passing, Rebecca Hall also quietly gave one of the year’s least celebrated great performances in this intelligent, surprising variation on assorted haunted-house formulae – which came and went with little fanfare in cinemas in August, 18 months after its well-received Sundance debut. Admittedly, David Bruckner’s film (a considerable step up from his accomplished but less distinctive woodland nerve-rattler The Ritual) suffered from a certain lack of novelty in one respect, being the latest in a recent run of horror films in which grief is the real bogeyman. But rarely has the idea been explored and performed with the wounded conviction and complexity that Hall brings to it, as a widowed teacher who can’t quite let go of her husband’s presence in the gorgeous lake house he built her – perhaps because he hasn’t let go of it either.

12/30/2021,"It is hard to pinpoint the worst moment of your life. But when I think about my lowest ebb, a certain image begins to solidify: me, lying in the gangway of a plane, the cabin crew administering oxygen via a canister and a mask as we descend to Budapest airport and other passengers look on (bemused or horrified, I couldn’t say). A couple of minutes previously, a fog had descended on me as I sat in the seat next to my boyfriend; peculiar black clouds coalesced at the margins of my vision. I was passing out. “I need to lie down,” I said, with some urgency. “I need to lie down, now.” Why does this image stand out? I suppose it is because, ultimately, it is about denial – and the point at which that stops being possible. The thing I didn’t want to know was that I was ill. Again. I had no business being on a plane. I had only been able to get on the plane at all as a result of the large white wine and two co-codamol tablets I had necked at the airport. It was no doubt the chemical effects of these that led to me almost blacking out. That and the fact I had been hyperventilating for the duration of the flight.  Those who have had panic attacks know that appealing to rationality rarely works. As far as I was concerned, being on that plane meant that I was about to die. There was no arguing with this. This didn’t manifest only psychologically; physiologically, extreme anxiety has all kinds of dramatic effects. My body knew the score. Since the Paris terror attacks two months prior, I had refused to accept that the post-traumatic stress disorder with which I had been diagnosed as a student – and which I had recovered from – had come back. The first time I had it was because I was strangled by a stranger on a dark street as I made my way home. But, with treatment, I had recovered well. For the most part, I put it behind me and got on with my life. Then, in my late 20s, I was in close proximity to the Paris attacks. Once more, I was forced to face the notion that I might be about to die. It sent my system into meltdown. The belief that I was safe, which had taken many hours of therapy – not to mention medication – to build back up, had been demolished. It was as though my mind and my body were not going to be fooled this time. In a way, post-traumatic stress is like time travel. You are walking around, living your life in the present, but a part of you is back there in the traumatic event, reliving that night again and again, your body responding accordingly. I had convinced myself after Paris that I was simply in shock and that the symptoms would fade, but a part of me must have known in the run-up to the Budapest press trip that it wasn’t a good sign that I was hearing French sirens in my sleep, that every time I got on a bus or went to a bar I expected to be shot dead. I must also have known that I should see a doctor, get back on the meds, join the waiting list for therapy, but I was resisting. To do so would mean admitting that I was ill. More than anything, I did not want to be ill again. So, instead, I decided to carry on as though everything were normal. I continued to arrange the trip to Budapest despite feeling paralysing horror at the thought of it. Once I got there, after recovering enough to walk off the plane, I spent the entire time convinced there were gunmen around every corner. The only respite was the discovery that I could order very cheap, very strong martinis to our hotel room. This meant that, at least in the evenings, I was sufficiently tipsy not to feel afraid when I went out. I returned to the UK exhausted. My experience on the plane was humiliating, but it was also the beginning of my acceptance of the fact that I was not OK. I had become interested in the psychology of trauma after I was attacked, but I didn’t seem to be applying any of that knowledge to myself. My trip to Hungary, and its effects, changed that. It made me accept that I needed help. It took a year of intensive treatment, including exposure therapy, for me to be able to leave the house without fear. I was very lucky to receive the help I did so quickly, and for the therapy to have continued past the usual 12 free sessions. Gardening and writing also helped; I spent much of the time confined to my home working on a novel about trauma. The following January, I went to Vietnam and Cambodia, a trip that involved six flights, all of which I took without needing to self-medicate through the fear – unthinkable when I was at my most agoraphobic. I didn’t have a panic attack that meant I needed to lie in the gangway; the plane didn’t fall out of the sky. Not only did I live, but I got to see a bit of that world that I had been missing for those long months. That year, my novel found a publisher and I got married. Since then, I have been writing another book and working on a creative nonfiction project that, among other things, looks at what it means to contemplate motherhood when you have experienced mental illness. I am wary of recovery stories, partly because I don’t take it for granted that I will always be well. When I look back on that young woman lying in the aisle of a plane, she isn’t exactly a stranger, but she does belong to a different phase of my life. And she taught me an important lesson: never deny yourself help out of fear and pride. If I get ill again, I will do my best to remember that.

Ten months after applying for letters of administration, we are still waiting for probate to be granted. His house has to be sold to pay off an equity loan within 12 months of his death. We are losing £1,000 a month in interest on the loan with no sign of a solution.DK, Bromley You are among many grieving relatives caught in a ruinous legal limbo because of probate delays. Last year, in a bid to streamline the system, the process was moved online and local courts were closed. Coupled with Covid and staff shortages, the result, for many, has been waiting times of several months. At the same time, the government is proposing to raise probate fees by up to 137% next year, a move the Law Society insists must be accompanied by service improvements.  “In 2020, people had to wait 12 to 14 weeks on average to receive their grant. This is unacceptable,” says Law Society president, I Stephanie Boyce. “Our members have also told us that since the online probate service was made available to all professional users in October 2019, they have experienced issues with the online system, communication issues with HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS), errors on issued grants, and property transactions have been impacted due to delays in grant of probate.” It’s frustrating that HMCTS managed to grant probate within two days of my contact. It told me that your mother’s death had complicated the application and led to clerical errors. “We apologise sincerely for delays that must have made a challenging period even more difficult,” it says. It told the Observer that improvements to the online service and staff recruitment had reduced average waiting times to just over two weeks. The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman can address unresolved complaints about probate services, but applicants have to be referred by their MP once they’ve exhausted HMCTS’s procedure.

12/30/2021,"In May Chloe Roberson of Chattanooga, Tennessee, injured her knee while working her shift at Amazon and she has been out of work since, while fighting with the company for workers’ compensation and paid medical leave. Roberson, 21, chose to go to the emergency room rather than Amazon’s on-site medical clinic, Amcare, and was referred to a sports medicine doctor who diagnosed her with a dislocated patella (kneecap). Her initial recovery was 10 weeks of physical therapy followed by a steroid shot, but she was later scheduled for surgery on 28 October to repair her knee.  “While all of this is going on, I’ve been having to fight Amazon for time off and money,” said Roberson. “They refused workers’ compensation, as I had a dislocated patella when I was 14 years old. I’m 21 now so I don’t see how it’s related.” Roberson and her wife have struggled to cover bills while recovering from her injury and battling Amazon. “I have not had a single day that I haven’t been an absolute sobbing mess because of the stress Amazon continues to put me through,” added Roberson. Reports of high injury rates and high turnover rates at Amazon warehouses around the US as a result of immense productivity pressures and quota rates on workers have been documented by numerous media outlets and organizations over the past several years and confirmed by OSHA logs. Amazon shareholders have recently called for an independent safety audit of the company. A May 2021 report published by the Strategic Organizing Center found Amazon’s injury rates were double the injury rate in the warehousing industry and 80% higher than the industry average for serious injuries in 2020. Jerald Crowley worked at an Amazon distribution center in Greenville, South Carolina, for six months before he resigned on 3 November due to a wrist injury he sustained on the job, as he is deaf and couldn’t afford to lose use of his hand to communicate in sign language with his children. His rate for stacking boxes on pallets was 40 boxes an hour, and he cited the rate as the reason for his injury. “I suffered a high sprain on my right wrist when I was attempting to bring a box in the back of the pallet,” Crowley said. “Their safety rules are that I’m supposed to report it and they will bring it down, but their rate is 40 boxes an hour. I was trying to get credit for the box – if I did not, they could let me go simply because I did not meet the rates, so safety was basically out the window when they chose rates over safety.” On 1 January 2021, the state of Washington increased workers compensation premiums for Amazon due to higher injury rates at Amazon warehouses compared with other warehouses in the state. In December 2021, the National Employment Law Project released a report on injury rates at Amazon’s six warehouses in Minnesota, revealing those facilities have injury rates twice as high as rates for other warehouses in the state, and more than four times the average for all industries in the state. An Amazon spokesperson said in response to the report: “While we know we’re not perfect, this report ignores the perspectives of the vast majority of our employees in Minnesota, who tell us that they’re proud to work at Amazon and feel supported in their roles.” Mustafa Omar started working at Amazon in 2016, but left in 2017 and returned in 2018, and has worked there for the past three years. He picks and loads items that weigh up to 80lbs, typically working on six or seven different stations. He has experienced back pain due to the repetitive motions and lifting heavy items involved in his job. In early November 2021, Omar fell back onto a pallet, injuring his back. He flagged down a senior manager to get his station covered so he could go to Amcare. Omar said he felt like he was in trouble when he asked the manager to take him to the clinic, where he was given ice and ibuprofen. “At this time, I’m thinking ‘oh my God, if I say that I have an injury, that I’ve hurt myself, I might lose my job.’ Because they already instilled fear in me about me being the one that was getting in trouble. I’m thinking about my family, my pregnant wife, my kids, about all the bills that I have and worrying about not being able to work because I’m the breadwinner in my house,” said Omar. Once at Amcare, he downplayed the pain he was feeling so he would be sent back to work, and continued working for a few weeks while visiting Amcare about twice a day for ice and ibuprofen. Eventually he couldn’t tolerate the pain any longer and visited his own doctor, who recommended physical therapy, pain medication and light duty accommodations. When he brought his doctor’s forms to Amazon, Omar says he was told he couldn’t attend the recommended physical therapy because it wasn’t approved. He is still waiting to hear back about getting medical treatment approved by Amazon and his workers’ compensation claim approved and paid out. “I’m still in pain today,” Omar added. “All of us want to come home safely, and when people get injured they should be treated like human beings and taken care of.” Irene Tung, senior researcher and policy analyst at NELP, and Debbie Berkowitz, worker health and safety director at NELP, coauthors of the report, explained Amazon’s high injury rates are a result of rapid work paces, surveillance and disciplinary systems. They added that workers have to operate under constantly changing rules and metrics, regulatory agencies are underfunded, and worker protections are inadequate. “None of these measures that Amazon have taken have really got to the core of the problem, which is the excessively rapid work pace and how it’s enforced through their very distinctive disciplinary system that combines intensive electronic surveillance with very frequent discipline and termination. They have not addressed that and that is the fundamental driver of these injuries,” said Tung. Berkowitz added Amazon’s time-off task disciplinary technology cultivates a climate of fear among workers and drives them to push their bodies in a way that creates high rates of injuries. “Workers are measured by the second and they’re punished by the second,” said Berkowitz. “It basically creates an environment where if they’re not constantly moving, then they might be fired.” Several workers who spoke with the Guardian described delays and other obstacles in applying for workers compensation or receiving medical treatment after sustaining an injury on the job at Amazon. Natalie Monarrez, age 52, has worked as a ship dock worker at Amazon in Staten Island, New York, for about four years. During the pandemic, she lived in her car outside the Amazon warehouse while working a lot of overtime – 12-hour shifts, five to six days a week – as many workers took unpaid leaves in the first few months of the pandemic. Monarrez said several months into the pandemic, the grueling nature of her job and long hours began taking their toll on her body. “Swelling in my left ankle had just reached a point where I couldn’t even fit it in a shoe. I had trouble walking. I had trouble standing,” said Monarrez. “As my job is sorting, I have to stand in the same spot for my entire shift. We’re not allowed to sit down and I was lifting heavy packages the entire time and rotating the upper half of my body. But I couldn’t take it anymore and I knew that it was because of work.” She filed a workers’ compensation claim in August 2020, though she said she received pushback from managers while trying to file the claim until she took off her shoe, showed them her ankle, and insisted on filing the claim and being sent to an Amazon-approved doctor. Once she filed the claim, Monarrez said she has experienced several problems in contacting Amazon’s workers’ compensation insurer, Sedgwick, to correct her pay above the weekly minimum and getting medical treatments and a medical boot for her ankle approved. She took a couple months off work, but returned to work because the compensation she was receiving, about $400 a week, was much lower than her usual weekly paychecks. “At this point, I went to Walmart and Target and I literally bought my own braces for my ankle and my foot, and I elevate my foot every night after work,” said Monarrez. “I never had health issues before working for Amazon.” Amazon did not comment on complaints about workers’ compensation and deferred to a blog post by CEO Dave Clark on time-off task surveillance and disciplinary systems. In regards to injury rates, a spokesperson for Amazon said in an email: “The safety and well-being of our employees is always a top priority. We recognize that helping employees stay safe in physical roles takes a lot of focus and investment, which is why we’re investing hundreds of millions in safety in many different ways, from people – we now have a team of nearly 8,000 dedicated safety professionals – to training, to tools and technology.”",News/Technology,‘I’m still in pain’: Amazon employees say climate of fear has led to high rates of injuries,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/30/amazon-employees-climate-fear-high-rates-injuries
12/30/2021,"Surviving members of the Kindertransport have urged the government to reopen safe routes for refugees in Europe, especially children, trying to reach the UK or risk more tragedies occurring in the Channel. Alf Dubs, Stephanie Shirley and Erich Reich, who all arrived in the UK between 1938 and 1939 as child refugees on the Kindertransport, an initiative set up to rescue nearly 10,000 Jewish child refugees before the second world war, said the UK was losing its moral authority in the world and urged the government to change tack.  Their warning comes amid deepening calls for a public inquiry into the deaths of 27 refugees who drowned in the Channel last month, after lawyers representing bereaved family members said “serious failings” in the rescue operation may have contributed to their deaths. “We warned this would happen and that the policies the government has been following was going to lead to this happening,” Lord Dubs said. “We shouldn’t allow this to happen. We should do the right thing. And the right thing is to have safe and legal routes for people to find safety. Not every refugee in the world, but certainly those that have some connection with Britain. “That’s what was the position before we left the EU and it’s really a tragedy that we’ve gone backwards in this regard.” In 2016, the government accepted an amendment by Dubs to resettle 3,000 child refugees. Once the scheme ended in 2020, only 480 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Europe were resettled. After the UK left the EU, Dubs put in another amendment, which would require the government to negotiate an agreement with the EU to ensure that unaccompanied children in Europe could continue to come to the UK to join a family member after Brexit, but it was rejected, he said. “They’re closing down legal routes to safety and I find that shocking,” he said. “We’re pushing asylum seekers into the sea … We’re just doing the same as what is happening tragically in parts of the Mediterranean.” Dame Stephanie pointed to a recent survey by Safe Passage, which campaigns for safe legal routes for refugees seeking protection, that showed more than half the children the charity was supporting had lost faith in the legal process. “I’m so proud of this country. I love it passionately, but we’ve lost our moral leadership in the world,” she said. “We’ve got something like 11,000 children stuck somewhere on the streets of Calais, or in refugee camps [in Europe]. It’s not a safe place for children. Every day 17 go missing, and that means that they’ve been killed or exploited or have been trafficked. These are figures that are very difficult to accept in any civilised society.” Reich, who is the chair of Kindertransport group at the Association of Jewish Refugees, said he was upset when he saw the news of the record number of refugees dying crossing the Channel. He believes, as a minimum, the government must announce an ambitious directive that resettles child refugees in Europe with a connection to the UK. “I think it was our 70th anniversary of the Kindertransport that Prince Charles came and gave a short speech. But what he said was very interesting. He said: ‘I’m so glad that the government of the time allowed you in, because you have given back so much to this country.’ And that’s what it’s all about,” he said. He added that the government’s anti-immigrant policies were “a great source of anguish for me”. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK has always provided sanctuary for those fleeing persecution, oppression or tyranny and in 2020, we received the second highest number of asylum applications from UASC out of all European countries.” Under current immigration rules, unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in Europe with family members in the UK can apply to join eligible sponsors. The spokesperson added: “However, opportunities to claim UK asylum from within Europe only incentivise people into making treacherous journeys. That is why the New Plan for Immigration will enable the world’s most vulnerable to come to the UK through safe and legal routes, while making it more difficult for people to enter the UK illegally and stay.”",News/World news,Kindertransport Britons urge UK to reopen safe routes for refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/kindertransport-britons-urge-uk-to-reopen-safe-routes-for-refugees
12/30/2021,"A Filipino-inspired doughnut shop in New York that started as a short-term project after its founders were made jobless by the pandemic has become so in demand that it attracted a waiting list of 10,000 customers. The Kora doughnuts – which are getting media attention – join a long list of hit baked goods in New York whose fame suddenly sees demand rocket. They include the cupcakes of the West Village’s Magnolia Bakery and the “cronut craze” of 2013, where the makers of a croissant-doughnut hybrid saw customers queuing up at dawn until they were forced to limit purchases to two each.  Chef Kimberly Camara started making doughnuts in her apartment in Woodside, Queens, in the summer of 2020 with her partner Kevin Borja, after they both lost their jobs at Union Square Hospitality Group when coronavirus hit the city. At first, Camara and Borja, both 28, relied on the help of friends and family to deliver them to customers. But now they have a five-person strong staff force, an industrial kitchen and are looking to open a shop. Their online business, which has over 38,000 followers on Instagram, attracted so many orders that when their waiting list hit 10,000 they had to close it while they worked through all the orders. It is currently at around 5,000. “When we started Kora we had no intention of turning it into a full-blown business,” said Camara. “It was something that we thought would just be a seasonal project, something that maybe we would start and end in a couple of months during the summer of 2020. We kind of just went with the flow.” As demand for doughnuts grew, they continued to expand. “It’s really about the connection that we’ve been able to make with people through the doughnuts. Whether it’s through nostalgia, storytelling – people can relate to a lot of the stories that I would tell regarding how I came up with certain flavors and brought them to life through a doughnut,” said Camara. One of their signature creations is a leche flan doughnut, made from a brioche dough with a round piece of flan in the centre made using Camara’s late grandmother Corazon’s leche flan recipe from a book she found after she died. Camara, who trained at the Culinary Institute of America, came up with her doughnut recipe by chance when she decided to fry some brioche dough rather than bake it.",News/US news,"Sweet success: 10,000 on waiting list for New York bakery’s doughnuts",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/new-york-doughnuts-kora-bakery
12/30/2021,"Americans are again facing a stay-at-home New Year’s Eve as US political leaders and senior health advisers have urged people to scrap party plans and avoid larger public events as daily cases of Covid-19 break all previous records. In New York, attendance at the Times Square celebration known as the Ball Drop – in essence, tens of thousands of people watching a 12-foot geodesic sphere inlaid with Waterford crystals descend a long pole – has been capped at 15,000, down from pre-pandemic 60,000, with organizers encouraging revelers to watch it on TV or online.  The scaling back comes as the incoming New York mayor, Eric Adams, cancelled his inauguration party, and the outgoing mayor. Bill de Blasio, sees his last New Year’s party severely diminished. As recently as last month, before Omicron made headlines, de Blasio was in an end of two-terms party mood. “Everyone come on down,” he said on 16 November. “We can finally get back together again. It’s going to be amazing.” But recently – on the same day New York reported its highest number of new virus cases ever – de Blasio said the city would scale back its New Year’s event. Attendees must be fully vaccinated and wear masks. The changes are meant to “keep the fully vaccinated crowd safe and healthy as we ring in the New Year”, the mayor said in a statement. In Chicago, the Illinois governor, Jay Pritzker, has not yet imposed restrictions or shut down the city’s traditional fireworks show. But he warned Chicagoan this week that “Omicron and Delta are coming to your party”. “You need to think twice about how many people will be gathered together, keeping social distancing if you’re at a party. And if you can’t, leave,” he added. San Francisco has canceled its fireworks show over the Bay for the second year in a row. Mayor London Breed told residents that “we must remain vigilant in doing all we can to stop the spread of the Covid-19 Omicron variant”. Atlanta, too, has canceled its Peach Drop where for 30 years, revelers have gathered to watch a glitter fake peach descend to the ground.The Atlanta mayor later issued a press release, announcing the decision. “In consultation with public health officials, we have made the very difficult decision to cancel the Peach Drop,” the Atlanta mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, said in a press release. “As positive Covid-19 cases rise, I encourage everyone to be safe, get vaccinated and follow CDC guidelines.” But Seattle has decided to go ahead with fireworks from the Space Needle and Las Vegas plans an eight-minute fireworks display along the Strip. Health experts and officials have explained that Las Vegas’s celebrations take place across the city – not in a tightly-packed area. “It’s the entire city having this party,” Dr Brian Labus, an infectious disease epidemiologist at UNLV, told KTNV. “We’ve been dealing with crowds coming to Las Vegas for the past two years. So, New Year’s Eve isn’t really anything new. It’s just kind of a bigger event.” Las Vegas may in many ways turn out be the devil-may-care exception. Events in Paris, London, Berlin have been canceled, while domestic US and international health officials urge caution. The WHO director, General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, urged earlier this month for people to approach the holidays cautiously, even if that meant canceling or delaying a shindig. “An event canceled is better than a life canceled,” Tedros told reporters. “It’s better to cancel now and celebrate later, than to celebrate now and grieve later.” The Biden administration’s top health adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, recently advised that a small limited gathering with vaccinated family members would be the safest way to celebrate. “If your plans are to go to a 40-to-50 person New Year’s Eve party with all the bells and whistles and everybody hugging and kissing and wishing each other a Happy New Year – I would strongly recommend that, this year, we do not do that,” Fauci said during a White House update on the pandemic on Wednesday.",News/US news, US cities scale back New Year’s Eve events and urge people to scrap parties,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/us-new-years-eve-stay-at-home-scale-back-events
