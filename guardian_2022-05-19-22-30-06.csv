5/19/2022,"A housing unit for mothers and babies has been forced to close after a damning report found that the “cramped and unsafe” accommodation breached their human rights. In its report, the Children and Young People’s Commissioner Scotland said the unit, which housed asylum-seeking mothers and their children, had radiators and gas cookers dangerously close to babies’ cots, a lack of natural light and little ventilation, and no space for babies to crawl, play or walk. Each of the 38 rooms measures approximately 5 metres by 3 metres (16ft x 10ft) and contains a single bed, cot, kitchenette and shower. The unit, run by a Home Office subcontractor, Mears Group, was opened in January 2021 to house mothers and babies while Covid-19 restrictions were in place. Women were moved out of flats in the city centre and accommodated in the unit on the periphery of Glasgow’s Southside. The accommodation was described as “prison-like” by the charity Amma Birth Companions, which repeatedly called for its closure. Mears said the last mother and baby had now left the unit and the Scottish Children’s Commissioner confirmed that the women had been relocated to more appropriate accommodation. The closure of the site comes after criticism of accommodation provided for asylum seekers in Glasgow when a knife attack at a hotel in the centre of the city in 2020 left six people wounded and the attacker shot dead by police. Campaigners from a Glasgow group, Refugees For Justice, said the attack was a “direct result of the dysfunctional UK asylum support and accommodation system” and that there was an accommodation crisis in the city. Ai* arrived at the unit in the autumn of 2021, when she was three months pregnant. She lived there for seven months, and, following the birth of her daughter in March this year, she was moved out. “When I first arrived, I thought I was only going to stay for a few hours, but then they gave me a key for the room,” she said through an interpreter. “When I opened the door, I was really scared. The room was so small, with no privacy and you [could] hear all the babies crying all around. “Then there were mice in the room. I told my midwife, who complained to the staff at the unit, but they did nothing. They just told me to cover up the food.” Ai, who was in a safe house for trafficked women until she arrived at the unit, says that she was asked to sign a tenancy contract, which stipulated that nobody could stay over to support her with her baby, and imposed a 10pm curfew. “Every mum has to manage by themselves,” she said. “There were so many loud noises, and fire alarms going off in the day and at night, which scared my baby. Sometimes we had to take our babies outside at night, when the alarm went off.” The unit housed 38 women, and Ai says there were only six washing machines, all far away from the rooms. “I had to wash my clothes and my baby’s clothes in the sink sometimes, pouring dirty water in where I washed plates and prepared food,” she said. She added that the window in her room would get stuck, with a barrier in front of it, leaving the room poorly ventilated and cold. Mears said it was aware of a pest-control issue and had put measures in place at the unit, adding that furniture had been arranged so that cots were not set up close to kitchen equipment. In a statement, Mears added: “The mother and baby unit was purpose-designed with the advice of the local authority and NHS at a time when we had a significant number of mothers and babies to support and did not have suitable accommodation. “Our aim was to provide a good standard of accommodation and enhanced wraparound support for mothers and their children. As accommodation needs have changed, we now operate the unit as initial accommodation for single females who are newly arrived into Glasgow.” Maree Aldam, of Amma Birth Companions, welcomed the news that the last family had now left the unit. She said: “Although we welcome the progress made to relocate mothers with babies into more suitable accommodation, we remain concerned about the long-term effects of this experience on the affected mothers and their babies. “We continue to call on the Scottish government to put in place minimum housing standards that will protect every child in the asylum process from ever enduring such living conditions again.” * Name has been changed to protect her identity Reporting for this article was supported by a grant from the International Women’s Media Foundation’s Howard G Buffett fund for women journalists.",News/Global development,‘Cramped and unsafe’: Glasgow mother and baby housing unit is closed down,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/19/cramped-and-unsafe-glasgow-mother-and-baby-housing-unit-is-closed-down
5/19/2022,"At least 25 people were killed on Wednesday by security forces in Tajikistan during a protest in the autonomous region of Gorno-Badakhshan (GBAO), where the Tajik regime has targeted the Pamiri ethnic minority. The deaths mark an escalation of violence in the region. Conflict between the central government and the Pamiri has continued for decades, with the cultural and linguistic minority ethnic group suffering human rights abuses, as well as discrimination over jobs and housing. The Pamir region has been the only place in Tajikstan where anti-government protesters still take to the streets, despite the authoritarian pro-Kremlin regime. According to witnesses, several hundred residents of Khorog, the capital of GBAO, gathered at the weekend to call for the dismissal of the governor and the release of demonstrators arrested for participation in a protest in November, when three men were killed and 17 wounded by security forces. Protests continued until Wednesday when, as people marched to the main square in Khorog, security forces blocked the road and allegedly started firing rubber bullets, stun grenades and teargas at the protesters, killing at least 25 people. The Tajik government claimed “members of an organised criminal group” had blocked the highway “in order to destabilise the social and political situation”. In a statement on the state news agency, Khovar, the interior ministry said: “Law enforcement agencies have begun an anti-terror operation … in a restive region that borders Afghanistan and China and has long been a flashpoint of tensions.” The Tajik authorities claimed that arms and support from foreign “terrorist organisations” were coming in to the Pamiri region. “The organised criminal groups did not comply with the lawful demands of law-enforcement officers to hand over their weapons and ammunition, and put up armed resistance,” the interior ministry said. But activists said their protests had been peaceful. “The government is branding and naming the peaceful protesters as ‘terrorists’, which is a complete fake, and then using that as an excuse to shoot at them,” said one Pamiri activist who cannot be named for security reasons. During the Tajikistan civil war from 1992 to 1997, thousands of Pamiris were killed in what some human rights activists have described as “ethnic cleansing”. In 2012, during clashes seen by many in GBAO as an attempt by the Tajik government to bring the autonomous region under its full control, at least 40 civilians were killed. In February, parents of men killed by Tajik forces during a protest in November called on the international community to step in and protect ethnic minority groups. Families have demanded that the soldiers responsible for killing their sons be brought to justice and urged the United Nations to intervene. Tajikistan’s president of 28 years, Emomali Rahmon, who met the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Monday, is seen by the Pamiri as wanting to take control of Gorno-Badakhshan. Neil Clarke, head of the legal programme at Minority Rights Group International, told the Guardian: “The deteriorating human rights situation in the region is leaving the population, who are mainly Indigenous peoples and ethnic and linguistic minorities, at serious risk of harm. “We now believe that without urgent measures, the situation could escalate towards increasing conflict,” he said. “The widespread harassment of the population of GBAO by authorities including the police, security and military personnel appears increasingly systematic. These include wide-ranging forms of surveillance and invasions of privacy, arbitrary detention and the use of coercion to obtain signatures and/or public statements against the will of the individual.” Since November security checkpoints have been reinforced, and hundreds of people who took part in the demonstrations have been arrested or banned from leaving the region. Clarke said the latest deaths marked renewed efforts to suppress the Pamiri. “Authorities have reinstated a blockade on internet connection in the region and have again begun to arrest and detain prominent civil society leaders and independent individuals under the alleged pretext of an ‘anti-terror operation’,” he said.“Pamiri people are not the terrorists. We are calling for urgent measures by Tajikistan authorities to de-escalate the developing conflict, by restoring and ensuring the respect for human rights in GBAO and most urgently call on authorities to release the activist Ulfatkhonim Mamadshoeva and others who have been detained and interrogated by security forces, without due process, as part of efforts to silence the voice of Pamiri activists.” Since crackdowns on opposition groups in 2014 in Tajikistan, it is thought that 15 activists who left the country have disappeared in Russia or Turkey.",News/Global development,Twenty-five ethnic Pamiris killed by security forces in Tajikistan protests,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/19/twenty-five-ethnic-pamiris-killed-by-security-forces-gorno-badakhshan-tajikistan-protests
5/19/2022,"In 2018, following a bruising divorce, the British singer Sarah Brown was “broke, financially, emotionally and spiritually – I had nothing to live for”. At her lowest ebb, she turned to a voice that had given her crucial guidance and succour when she was a child: Mahalia Jackson, the pre-eminent gospel star of the 20th century. “Pop music was banned in my home growing up,” Brown says. “But my father owned records by Jim Reeves, Aretha Franklin and Mahalia Jackson. And Mahalia’s voice opened my spirit up. I grew up in a volatile home – my father beat my mum, he beat my older brother. I was seven years old, living in fear.” But in Jackson’s volcanic, resonant, impassioned voice, Brown found much-needed shelter and catharsis. “I was able to scream along with her, and release that fear. Mahalia helped release me.” Fifty years after Jackson’s death, Brown – whose debut album, released tomorrow, features her takes on Mahalia standards – is one of so many who continue to be inspired by her artistry, life story and activism. “She was as big as Beyoncé is today – the prime gospel artist of the 1950s and 1960s, when gospel was the dominant music,” says Al Sharpton, who toured with Jackson as a child preacher in the 1960s. “Mahalia’s the archetype for what we think of as gospel singing – her music is the building blocks for the golden age of gospel,” adds musician and label founder Matthew E White. “She is to gospel what Louis Armstrong was to jazz: the beginning of this music proliferating throughout culture.” Jackson’s mother died when she was five and she was raised by her devout Aunt Duke in New Orleans. She sang Protestant hymns with the choir at Plymouth Rock Baptist church – and while Duke forbade her from entering the nearby Pentecostal church, she couldn’t resist eavesdropping on their services from the street, seduced by their exuberant, chaotic and joyful noises unto the Lord. Jackson later absorbed the fevered passion of the Pentecostal services into her own singing, along with other verboten influences such as blues artists Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey, and the folk songs sung by workers at the docks. Her singing was so vociferous, so impassioned, she was, on more than one occasion, shooed out of the church. “Her voice was magnificent, powerful, like thunder,” says Brown. “You could hear the rock’n’roll, spiritual blues singer within this very strongly faith-led person.” This delicious dichotomy went both ways: secular music profoundly influenced her singing, but the ecstasy of her belief in a higher power was intoxicating. “Often as outsiders appreciating gospel culture, we fail to recognise that this is a true, personal, spiritual relationship the singer is having with their God,” says White. “That’s what Mahalia is expressing in her performances. When I listen to her sing, I feel she’s not with us, the audience – she’s not addressing us, she’s addressing that relationship with God.” The gospel-music recording industry barely existed when Jackson cut her first releases in 1937, the big labels assuming fans of gospel were too poor to afford records. Seemingly validating this scepticism, her earliest 78s for Decca sold badly. Pressured by the label to record blues songs instead, Jackson resisted – at the age of 14, she’d been visited by a vision of Christ walking across a verdant meadow, which she interpreted as “the Lord [telling] me to open my mouth in his name”, a mission she accepted without question. Refusing to sing “indecent music”, she returned to performing in churches and at revivals, making ends meet by selling her mother-in-law’s homemade cosmetics door-to-door. But within a decade she’d signed to a new label, Apollo, and her 1947 single Move On Up a Little Higher caught the ear of Chicago DJ Studs Terkel, who played the record incessantly on his radio show, comparing Jackson’s ever-ascending vocal to that of legendary tenor Enrico Caruso. Within a month, Move On Up had shifted 50,000 copies in Chicago; it went on to sell more than 8m worldwide. White says that at first, “that very southern, soulful style of singing wasn’t what the northern churches wanted – they considered it not the correct way to sing gospel”. But congregation after congregation was won over. Recalling his childhood days watching from the wings as she performed, Sharpton says that when Jackson sang, “her voice would build and build, and her audience would rise with her, to a point where they were overwhelmed”. “She brought this sense of being a part of something bigger than herself,” says Greg Cartwright, Memphis garage-rock cornerstone and leader of the Compulsive Gamblers, the Oblivians and Reigning Sound. “There’s a remarkable amount of redemption in what she sings, and it goes to the core of your heart. When she sings, it’s like when your mother soothes you when you’re a child – you feel at peace, and want to let that warm wave just wash over you.” Like Brown, Californian R&B maverick Fana Hues has intimate knowledge of Jackson’s gift, and the challenge she left in her wake. “When I started singing, my grandma said, ‘Oh, you sound like Mahalia!’” says Hues. “And I didn’t, not at all. But when I was 18, I had to perform her version of Precious Lord in a show in Vegas. It was such a huge song to tackle, a mountain to climb. R&B today has a lot of vocal acrobatics, but back then the purity came from her voice being a powerhouse. I had to deconstruct the way I sang – I had to get to the root of what it is to sing a song so that people will feel it.” In the years that followed Move On Up, Jackson became gospel’s crossover star. Her journey was remarkable: a singer born in poverty – who was told by an operatic tenor who tutored her earlier in her career that her singing was “undignified” – now found herself enjoying encores and standing ovations in the world’s most celebrated venues. In 1950, she became the first gospel artist to play New York’s Carnegie Hall. Two years later, she undertook her first tour of Europe, receiving 21 curtain calls in Paris. Her 1958 performance at the Newport jazz festival yielded one of her finest recordings; the same year, she collaborated with Duke Ellington for his ambitious suite Black, Brown and Beige. “The whole essence of jazz is to be instinctual, but also intentional,” says Hues. “That was Mahalia, through and through. In the traditional sense, she was untrained. But there was nothing amateur about her performance – her voice was so intentional.” Jackson’s appeal transcended religion, race, class and genre. But, says Sharpton, “she never lost her authenticity. She wasn’t shaped and moulded by her producers. She was the lady you saw at church every Sunday; she just sang better. Everyone knew Mahalia had gone through some marriage problems” – her first husband, Ike Hockenhull, had a gambling problem and squandered her money; her second husband, Sigmond Galloway, was abusive, cheated on her, and neglected her as her health declined in the 1960s – “so people felt she was singing from her own pain. After my parents broke up, my mother played Mahalia’s recording of Precious Lord every day. Mahalia got us through bad times. She did that for all of Black America.” Success didn’t spoil Jackson, who once declared: “Money just draws flies.” And she was keenly aware of the injustices her people suffered in Jim Crow America. “Mahalia came from the south, she knew segregation,” says Sharpton. She lent her artistry to the burgeoning civil-rights movement, singing in honour of Rosa Parks, raising bail money for jailed activists and working closely with Martin Luther King Jr. “A lot of gospel singers and church leaders did not believe in getting politically involved, but Dr King’s was a church-based organisation, so she could participate without leaving the church,” Sharpton continues. “She was a foundation of the civil-rights movement. Gospel was its soundtrack. They sang gospel songs when they marched, when they went to jail, when they were brutalised.” Jackson’s greatest contribution to the movement came with the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. At the Lincoln Memorial, before more than 250,000 marchers, she sang I’ve Been Buked, evoking the suffering the civil-rights activists were seeking to overturn, before manifesting the movement’s hope and defiance with How I Got Over. King was the final speaker that night, as Sharpton explains. “Martin’s chief of staff told me Martin was giving this speech with all these polysyllabic words, and, as a performer, Mahalia could tell he wasn’t getting the response he wanted. So she called to him from the side of the stage, ‘Tell ’em about the dream, Martin!’” At Jackson’s urging, King delivered the greatest speech of his career. “Listen back to it,” urges Hues. “His intonation was like he was singing.” Jackson had once patterned her singing on “the way the preacher would preach in a cry, in a moan”; now the nation’s most famous preacher was following her lead. Jackson never really recovered from King’s assassination in 1968. “She’d talk about Dr King in the dressing room,” remembers Sharpton. “She’d say, ‘Boy Preacher, I miss Martin, I wish he was around to see all this.’ It was personal for her.” As King had requested, she sang his favourite hymn, Precious Lord, at his funeral. The following year, at the Harlem cultural festival, she sang the hymn again, a startling, intense performance, handing the microphone to a 30-year-old Mavis Staples to finish the song, as if she were passing a baton. “It’s like a summit meeting, a ‘kumbaya’ moment,” says Questlove, who used footage of the performance for his acclaimed 2021 documentary Summer of Soul. Jackson continued to perform, touring Africa, the Caribbean and Japan, but her health was failing. She died in January 1972 at the age of 60, following surgery to clear a bowel obstruction. Aretha Franklin – whom Jackson had helped raise, and who had just recorded her acclaimed gospel concert album Amazing Grace – sang Precious Lord at her funeral. Half a century on, Jackson’s legacy remains indelible. For Sharpton, she “brought gospel mainstream, took it out of the chitlin circuit and brought it downtown. She made the world understand gospel music without watering it down. She made them take us on our own terms.” For Cartwright, Jackson’s music was “a bridge. And after two years of this pandemic, and with nationalism spreading everywhere, her messages of unity, love and forgiveness are exactly what the world needs right now.” For Brown, meanwhile, mimicking Jackson allowed her to find her own voice. As a young woman she joined the Inspirational Choir of the Pentecostal First Born Church of the Living God (who backed Madness on their 1983 hit Wings of a Dove), and later became a session singer, working with Stevie Wonder and Quincy Jones, and touring with Roxy Music and Simple Minds. Following her divorce, however, Brown felt estranged from her gift. “I didn’t feel I could sing love songs any more,” she says. “I couldn’t sing about chasing a man or being chased any more – I no longer believed in romantic love, at least not as Hollywood taught it.” Rudderless, Brown once again used Jackson as her compass. She set to work on a project she had been dreaming of for two decades, reinterpreting traditional spirituals that had become synonymous with Jackson. And just as Jackson located her own truths within timeless hymns, Brown’s album Sarah Brown Sings Mahalia Jackson finds her singing her own story through the religious standards. “I needed to sing about how I’d been abused, how I’d seen my father abuse my mother,” she says, “so I sang Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen. And I sang Didn’t It Rain, a song about hope and faith, because I had to believe one day I would sing with happiness. And I will. Returning to Mahalia was a cradle to my sorrow.” Jackson was, and remains, a salvation, Brown says, someone who “left us a legacy of authenticity. She was going to sing, whether she was signed to a record company or not. She wouldn’t change her voice, she wouldn’t change her material. She stood in her greatness. And that’s a lesson we could all learn from.”  Sarah Brown Sings Mahalia Jackson is released on 20 May on Live Records.",Arts/Music,‘She told Martin Luther King: tell ’em about the dream!’ The eternal life of gospel singer Mahalia Jackson,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/19/mahalia-jackson-martin-luther-king-al-sharpton
5/19/2022,"A battle is shaping up between major retailers over whether the UK should introduce an online sales tax, with Sainsbury’s demanding it to help revive struggling high streets while M&S argues it would have the opposite effect. A day before the government’s three-month consultation on changes to business taxes closes, the finance director of Sainsbury’s reiterated calls for an increase in taxes on digital retailers to fund a reduction on the business rates levied on physical stores. However, the finance head of Marks & Spencer, said an online sales tax would “punish” retailers that had worked hard to shift into modern ways of selling and leave them with less cash to invest in their high street estate. Kevin O’Byrne, the chief financial officer at Sainsbury’s, which owns Argos and Habitat as well as its supermarkets, said: “High business rates on shops is destroying high streets up and down the country. We urgently need fundamental business rates reform. “We urge the government to introduce an online sales tax that funds a reduction in business rates for retailers of all sizes and levels the playing field between physical and online retailers.” O’Byrne’s position contrasts with that of his counterpart at M&S, Eoin Tonge, who said: “Far from levelling up, an online sales tax would lock us down. It would make it even harder for the retailers the consultation is purportedly trying to help to invest in the digital transformation required to survive and grow in the modern, digital era. “The solution we need is practical, pragmatic reform of business rates and better taxing of global players to ensure everyone pays their fair share.” In a letter to the chancellor, excerpts of which were published by the BBC, Tonge said that putting an additional tax on retail, which he said was “already overburdened”, would “simply mean retailers cut their cloth accordingly”. “This rationalisation will always start with the least profitable parts of a business – which, in the case of multi-channel retailers, will more often than not be high street stores,” the letter said. M&S appears to be an outlier among retailers on the subject. Two weeks ago a “retail jobs alliance” of heavyweights in the sector, including Sainsbury’s and rival supermarket chains Tesco, Co-op and Morrisons, jointly called for an overall cut in business rates for all premises and said they were “open to the possibility” this could be funded through an online sales tax. The new group – which also included Greggs, Waterstones, B&Q-owner Kingfisher, the union Usdaw and the industry bodies representing independent retailers and convenience stores – said an online tax would help “level the playing field” between internet retailers and bricks-and-mortar stores at a time when Covid-19 has further shifted shopping habits online.

5/19/2022,"It all started with three oranges. One school breaktime in Jimma, western Ethiopia, Bibi and Bichu Tesfamariam saw a teacher throwing fruit into the air. “He had three oranges and started doing tricks, and me and my brother were like: ‘Wow, this is the coolest thing we’ve ever seen!’ We didn’t even know what it was called. He told us: ‘This is juggling,’” says younger brother Bichu, then 13, and now 38. The brothers were desperate to learn. “We came back the next day with lots of oranges.”That was the start of a career that has led to the brothers performing around the world, from appearing at the opening celebrations of the Millennium Dome in London to the Fuji Rock festival in Japan. They have juggled at English National Opera and on numerous TV shows. They provided entertainment for 14 years at Giffords Circus before setting up Circus Abyssinia to showcase the talent of other young circus artists from Ethiopia. Their latest show, Tulu, is about to set out on a world tour, starting in London before going to Edinburgh.Circus wasn’t a big part of Ethiopian culture when Bichu and Bibi were growing up – they’d only glimpsed it on TV – but after that breaktime encounter the pair became obsessed with juggling. The teacher in question was from Canada and brought in a Cirque du Soleil video, which they would diligently copy. He taught them how to make their own juggling balls by cutting a sock in half, filling it with sand or seeds and sewing it up. They would make their own juggling clubs out of wood in the school workshop. “We’ve still got scars from the blades,” says elder brother Bibi, 40. The brothers would perform tricks in the market opposite their house every Thursday and Saturday, drawing a crowd. “It was fascinating to us, the ways we could keep the balls in the air,” says Bichu. “And the reaction from the audience made us want to keep going.” They started training in acrobatics at a local school, and were invited to join a circus tour in South Africa as teenagers. They had found their calling.The response from their parents, however, was mixed. Their mum was supportive. “It kept us out of trouble – from getting involved in fighting in the street,” says Bibi. But their father, a maths teacher, wanted them to focus on studying. “African parents, their minds are already set: you’ll be a doctor, nurse, engineer, that kind of thing. They had the shock of their lives when we said this is what we wanted to do.” The brothers were determined, though. “That feeling you get when you perform, the response from the public, it’s addictive,” says Bibi. “Our minds were already made up.”That Bibi and Bichu were in it together gave them the confidence to pursue their dreams. The pair are very close; when we speak, Bichu has been in Ethiopia for three months and Bibi is at home in London. It’s the longest they’ve been apart. “I find it really weird,” says Bichu. “He’s my best friend. Usually we see each other every day.”“I’m the older one, but he’s stronger than me,” says Bibi. “He’s more stubborn. I’m more calm. Sometimes I give up on things but if he wants something, nothing will stop him, which is a good thing.” Bichu laughs: “I agree, I’m quite stubborn. When we started Circus Abyssinia we had nothing, no setup, but I said: ‘Right, I want to do our own thing,’ and he believed in me.” Once the brothers started touring Europe and making money, their dad changed his mind. They moved to London and carved out a successful career, but they knew they wanted to create something to honour their roots. “We wanted to make circus with our culture,” says Bichu. “We want to express ourselves, to be us, and not copy western countries.”Having sponsored a circus school back home, Circus Wingate, for almost a decade, they wanted to show how much skill is there. “Ethiopia has a very rich culture: all kinds of costumes, dancing, music,” says Bibi. “Yes we wanted to use that, but we wanted to prioritise the act. There are lots of African shows where people go to see the costumes and dancing, but we want people to appreciate that these are world-class performers. They can do all this crazy stuff.”One of those performers is Betelhem Dejene, 24, known as Betty. She was 10 and on her way to sign up for a karate class when she bumped into a trainer from Circus Wingate, who persuaded her to join his group instead. One look into the room and she was hooked. “Seeing the freedom of the kids, playing and throwing and catching – I’d never seen anything like that,” she says. Naturally limber, she trained as a contortionist. “I loved experiencing all the things I never knew my body could do. I knew I was flexible but I didn’t know I was that flexible!”Circus Abyssinia’s new show is also about celebrating Ethiopian talent – that of one woman in particular, the distance runner Derartu Tulu. Tulu was the first Black African woman to win an Olympic gold medal, in the 10,000m in 1992. It was a huge moment for African sport: Tulu and South African runner Elana Meyer were vying for the lead, with Tulu striding ahead on the final lap. “That was the first time we were allowed to stay up late in our house, to watch her run,” remembers Bichu. “It was very emotional. I remember how passionate she was about her country. Afterwards she was crying her eyes out. It stuck with us for a very long time.”“It made you realise that anything is possible,” says Bibi. It chimes with their own story: “Two young kids passionate about something and making it happen.” The show tells Tulu’s story, growing up tending cattle in her village. “She used to run in the middle of the night, chased by hyenas,” says Bichu. “I want to show Tulu’s strength, determination and courage,” says Dejene, who’ll be playing her. These are qualities that the performers have, too. Woven into the story will be hoop diving, hand-to-hand acrobatics, roller-skating and fire-juggling. Dejene, having given up contortionism after a back injury, decided to try something much more dangerous. She will be the first Ethiopian woman to perform the daredevil Russian swing: a swinging platform that launches acrobats vertically into the air, into multiple somersaults.“It’s all about timing,” says Dejene of mastering the apparatus. “You have to fly at the right moment and you have to focus literally 100% to do it.” Knowing that one bad landing could put her out of action with an injury (or much worse), she says, “It was very scary at first, but now I’ve got used to the timing it’s OK.” And now she’s nailed it, “I love the freedom of flying, how high I can go”.Being part of Circus Abyssinia has had a huge impact on Dejene and the other young performers. For many of them, when they go on tour, it’s the first time they have left the country or been on a plane. And despite what Bibi and Bichu’s dad first thought, the financial benefits can be significant. “I’m supporting myself and my family now,” says Dejene. “Most of our members, they’ve bought a house, bought a taxi, done so much for their families,” says Bichu. “I can’t imagine any of that when I was their age.”What are we going to see that’s distinctive about Ethiopian circus, I ask. “We are a very smiley people,” says Bichu. “Everyone is genuinely really happy to be on stage, to have that opportunity to show themselves, to have that freedom you feel.” While their show is distinctively Ethiopian, what Bichu really loves about circus is its universality. “You can express yourself without saying anything,” he says. “You can tell a story without words. It’s an international language. That’s so powerful.” Circus Abyssinia: Tulu is at the Underbelly festival in Earl’s Court, London, from Tuesday to 18 June and Underbelly’s Circus Hub on the Meadows, Edinburgh, from 6 to 27 August.",Arts/Stage,High hoops: how two brothers became Africa’s biggest circus duo,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/19/bibi-bichu-tesfamariam-circus-abyssinia-interview
5/19/2022,"Zahra Bei had been working as a teacher in London schools for almost two decades when she began to see education in a new light. She started her career as a business studies teacher in a secondary school and was quickly promoted to head of department. She loved teaching, she loved the kids, but as time went on she began to notice changes. Bei had come to London alone at the age of 16, leaving her Somali-born mother at home in Italy. She went to college, studied for a BTec, got herself into university, then did a PGCE and started teaching. It was a massive personal achievement and she felt “really proud” of herself. The job was demanding, the hours were long and Bei was also raising a young son, but as the years went by she detected a shift in the way pupils – and staff – were being managed. “We started to see behaviour policies beginning to clamp down. You’d have a long corridor of kids, sitting in isolation at these tables, bored out of their heads,” she said. Schools in England have increasingly adopted so-called zero-tolerance policies, where breaches of the school’s behavioural code can result in children being taken out of class and put in a separate area where they work alone, in silence, away from their peers. Critics say isolation can be damaging, not only for a child’s education but also their emotional wellbeing. Supporters say such measures are vital to ensure the rest of the class can learn without disruption. But for Bei her school was starting to seem more like a corporation, rather than the community one she’d joined. “You just feel like, well, this is not what I signed up for. And I remember that I gave in my notice overnight, without another job to go to.” It was the beginning of Bei’s journey towards No More Exclusions (NME), a community-based movement with a focus on racial justice in education, which she helped found in 2018. Its mission is to highlight the persistent race disparity in school exclusions and end the policy of excluding children from England’s schools, while also developing anti-racist teacher training and curriculum principles. Since Bei first began to notice those changes in schools, exclusion rates in England – both temporary and permanent – have risen sharply. Permanent exclusions in England rose from 5,082 in 2010/11 to 7,894 in 2018/19, while even in 2019/20, during Covid and lockdown, schools still managed to exclude 5,057 children. Fixed-term exclusions, or suspensions, reached a 13-year high in 2018/19 with a total of 438,265, dropping to 310,733 as a result of the pandemic disruption. The racial disparities are stark, with exclusion rates for black Caribbean students up to six times higher than those of their white peers in some local authorities, according to a recent Guardian analysis. Though many in the education sector are worried about exclusions, NME’s position is more radical than most who argue that some exclusions will always be necessary in the most extreme cases. Bei began to work with children outside mainstream schools in 2007, first at a “new arrivals centre”, mainly for refugee children from Afghanistan, Yemeni and Romania, but also accommodating a few local children at risk of exclusion. Today it would be called an alternative provision setting that caters for children who, for a variety of reasons, cannot attend mainstream school. “These are the kids that nobody wants to teach,” said Bei. Many were year 11 teenagers that schools were reluctant to take on as they would bring down GCSE results. “As a migrant myself, I felt a connection with these children,” she said. She stayed three years before moving on to a pupil referral unit (PRU), for children who have either been excluded from mainstream education or are at risk of being excluded. Many of the children in the PRU were black, with undiagnosed special educational needs and disabilities. Many were unable to read or write properly and they felt the shame and stigma of it. “Yes, the behaviour was challenging. There were definitely chairs flying – and that’s not a metaphor. But there was something that kept me there,” said Bei, who taught business, citizenship and Spanish. “There was a lot of angst among the kids. Like, ‘I’m a reject’. I recognised it and I was like: ‘Well I’m not buying your bullshit, I can see through it, and I’m not letting you go.’ And I know that even though they pretended that they didn’t give a shit about school, they did care. “A lot of the kids I taught at the PRU were definitely neurodiverse, but those needs weren’t being addressed as such. Instead we had the behaviour route. As many as 80% of them – maybe more – were dyslexic, autistic, dyspraxic, and needed extra help with reading but didn’t get it. And so we failed them, and we continue to fail them.” She stayed 10 years but in that time began to question the role of PRUs, and whether children should even be there. “It was like a holding pen,” she said. “It was my 17th or 18th year as a teacher and I’m a little bit ashamed to say it was probably the first time that I’d really looked at education in a critical way, through a social justice lens. “It took time for the penny to drop and for me to go – what about their human rights? What about their access to science labs, to a gym, to counsellors? All the things that mainstream kids would have?” There was a restructuring at the PRU and Bei left to study for a master’s in social justice and education at the Institute of Education at University College London. She has been fighting racism and social injustice in education ever since. She is now working on her PhD and her studies have informed the efforts of NME, which was set up around her kitchen table, with the help of some of her former students who had experienced the injustice of the education system first-hand. “I just got fed up with hearing about my students ending up in prison or dead,” said Bei. “I’m not shying away from the realities. Their realities are very harsh. Schools are a protective factor in children and young people’s lives. You remove the protective factor and you are exposing them to all manner of risks.” She cites the case of Tashaun Aird, 15, who was killed in Hackney, London, in 2019 after being permanently excluded and sent to alternative provision. “What we have got at the moment is not working. Can we at least agree it does not work?” Thanks to the work of NME, among others, the issue of exclusions and the damage they cause has risen up the education agenda, and there is growing pressure for change from parents, teachers, unions and public figures, including former children’s commissioner for England Anne Longfield. As well as raising awareness and campaigning for a change in the law on exclusions, NME also signposts sources of advice and advocacy for families affected by exclusion. “Sadly, we get emails every week from desperate parents,” said Bei. “And when I say desperate I mean desperate – saying, ‘My child has been excluded, my child has been put in isolation. I have to go into a meeting and I don’t know how to talk to these people. I feel the decision has already been made.’ Since Child Q,” she adds, “the floodgates have opened.” In March, it emerged that a 15-year-old girl, known only as Child Q, had been strip-searched during her period by police who were called to a Hackney school after teachers claimed they could smell cannabis. For many, the incident was indicative of the racism affecting black pupils in England’s schools. For Bei it exposed the way in which schools can end up colluding with criminalisation and carcerality. “A lot of us can’t process the rage,” she says. She’s worried about police in schools, about schools abdicating their safeguarding responsibilities and the adultification of black children. “The decision I’ve made, personally, is that I will not be in the classroom for as long as things don’t change. I’m almost in a self-imposed exile. What we want to see is accountability and we want to see change.”",News/Society,‘I got fed up with my students ending up in prison or dead’: the teacher fighting to end school exclusions,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/19/i-got-fed-up-with-my-students-ending-up-in-prison-or-dead-the-teacher-fighting-to-end-school-exclusions
5/19/2022,"Where is your arm right now? Would you say it’s in a natural position? Isn’t it always in a natural position? Is your natural position that same as my natural position? And if you’ve just wrestled with Davinson Sánchez for a few seconds before he volleys the ball from point blank range vaguely near you, where naturally would you put your arm? This is a question for Ashley Barnes’s subconscious – or it’s a question that Ashley Barnes’s subconscious got wrong last Sunday. It chose … poorly. It was not the holy grail of natural positions – unless of course you think he intentionally put his arm in that spot. It is his brain I suppose. Now, by the letter of the law – or in other words, just the law – the Burnley striker conceded a penalty that could have a decisive effect at the bottom of the Premier League for them and for Spurs’ Champions League push at the top, ignoring of course the fact that it all evens itself over the course of a season. But did Barnes make himself unnaturally bigger? Or just naturally bigger? Or naturally the same size but in a slightly different shape? Is Ashley Barnes’s surface area a constant or is it constantly changing - and how unnatural can it be? The actual law states: “A player is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger when the position of their hand/arm is not a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player’s body movement for that specific situation.” The interpretation seems to be judged not by people who’ve never played the game, but by people who have never moved about at all. Try wrestling a large Colombian man for a bit and see where your hands go. We have got to a stage where barely any players, no one in the stadium, at home – not even the most partisan Spurs fan – even noticed the handball, until the now traditional confirmation walk to the monitor; charades “TV show” sign (wish they’d do “Song” one time); theatrical point to the spot. There are lots of ways to easily upset football fans these days, and suggesting changing the laws of the game is a really easy one. Someone will ring you up and yell IF IT AIN’T BROKE DON’T FIX IT and then call you a melt or a dry lunch or something. But the laws aren’t perfect. Surely it’s worth a brainstorm/ideas lounge/thought carousel on the subject. Imagine we’re team Geronimo sitting on bean bags in the early stages of The Apprentice. One of us has a whiteboard and a Sharpie. Karren Brady is just over there. There’s no such thing as a bad idea. Let’s begin then with handball. Until 1912 the goalkeeper could handle the ball anywhere in their own half. It makes you wonder what those early FA Cup games were like. No back pass rule and keepers just picking it up whenever they liked. It’s sad to think that kids in the playground can’t just shout “ACCIDENTAL! BALL TO HAND!” but instead are trying to work out where the armpit begins and ends. So idea one. Let’s not go back to 1911, but just reintroduce deliberate handball only, unless you’re denying a goal. Stick it on the whiteboard. Next. Let me (re)introduce the Paul Doyle law. The former Guardian journalist’s idea that a penalty is awarded for denying a goal scoring opportunity anywhere on the pitch. You remember that foul by Ole Gunnar Solskjær near the half way line. Award a penalty and book the player. Keep 11 v 11. And crucially, don’t give a spot kick for every foul in the box. There are too many penalties. If a player doesn’t have a shot on, and is pushed or clipped, then it’s just a free-kick. The first example that springs to mind is a Liverpool penalty in 2020 at the London Stadium. Arthur Masuaku kicked Mo Salah’s foot as he went away from goal. Under the Paul Doyle law that’s a free-kick inside the box. And football would benefit from more of those. Sin-bins for professional fouls. Think Chiellini yanking Saka’s collar in the Euros. Stopping the play. No attempt to get the ball. Ten minutes in the bin. Better or worse for the game? Allow VAR to give bookings. Allow refs to book and send players off retrospectively. Allow yellow cards to be appealed. Encourage officials to book players for diving even if they’re fouled. Beckham clips Simeone. Red card. Simeone still dives. Book him (and book him for the tackle from behind – we’re going to win the ’98 World Cup!) Let’s think about heading the ball. At some point in the future – 20, 50 or 100 years – no one will believe that players ever used their heads. So let’s see what it looks like. Let’s consider phasing it out. Start with no heading apart from attempts at goal/denying attempts at goal ie from crosses. You can still score - but those booming headers from goal kicks and clearances will end. “LET IT BOUNCE” will be the new scream from Sunday League pitches up and down the country. And let’s try all these changes during the Community Shield. High-profile, but doesn’t matter. Some may work, some may not. Interpretation will always be part of it. But it is already. The task ends. Have we improved football? Hand your workings to Lady Brady. Go to the boardroom. Listen to Lord Sugar’s jokes. Be told not to fix it because it ain’t broke. Sit in that miserable cafe. Get fired. Try not to look at the comments.",Sport/Football,"Forget the letter of the law, let’s brainstorm our way to a better game | Max Rushden",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/19/forget-the-letter-of-the-law-lets-brainstorm-our-way-to-a-better-game
5/19/2022,"Pennsylvania Republicans have nominated state senator Doug Mastriano to be the next governor. Mastriano is one of the most radical gubernatorial candidates ever to receive a major party nomination. Many Republicans have indulged Trump’s claims that Democrats stole the 2020 presidential election. But few have gone as far as Mastriano has to try to justify Trump’s fever dream. On 25 November, Mastriano “staged a faux legal hearing in Gettysburg, in which Giuliani played prosecutor before a panel of Republican state senators and representatives”. Mastriano introduced a number of “poll watchers” who told unsubstantiated stories of “phantom ballots, hacked machines, and dead voters, which they claimed had all led to an election stolen from Trump”. Five days later, after all of Trump’s legal challenges had failed and the Pennsylvania secretary of state had formally certified Biden the winner, Mastriano introduced a resolution urging Congress to ignore the official results. His plan was for the Pennsylvania legislature to ignore millions of votes and directly appoint electors pledged to Trump. Ultimately, Mastriano’s resolution didn’t go anywhere in the Republican-controlled state legislature because Pennsylvania’s Democratic governor, Tom Wolf, did not yield to demands to call a special session. But Mastriano was not deterred. On 10 December 2020, Mastriano signed onto an amicus brief supporting Texas’ effort to convince the US supreme court to throw out the results in Pennsylvania and several other states. That effort also failed. In the lead-up to 6 January 2021, Mastriano was reportedly “in regular communication with Donald Trump.” On the day, Mastriano was at the US capitol and was captured on video “walking through police lines with a crowd of people.” In a statement, Mastriano said that “police lines did shift throughout the course of the day” and he “followed those lines as they existed”. (In February, Mastriano was subpoenaed by the January 6 committee. It is unclear if he complied.) In July 2021, Mastriano sent a letter “to several counties requesting information and materials needed to conduct a forensic investigation of the 2020 general election and the 2021 primary”. Mastriano’s conduct, however, was so extreme that he was removed from the process by the Republican leadership of the Pennsylvania senate. Senate president Jake Corman said that Mastriano was “only ever interested in politics and showmanship and not actually getting things done”. During his candidacy for governor, Mastriano has been clear that he will use his power – including his authority to appoint the Pennsylvania secretary of state – to influence the administration of future elections. He said the following on 30 March: I’m Doug Mastriano, and I get to appoint the secretary of state who’s delegated from me the power to make the corrections to elections, the voting logs and everything. I could decertify every machine in the state with the stroke of a pen via the secretary of state. I already had the secretary of state picked out. It’s a world-class person that knows voting integrity better than anyone else in the nation, I think, and I already have a team that’s gonna be built around that individual. Yesterday, with Trump’s endorsement, Pennsylvania Republicans put him one step closer to the governor’s mansion. In April, Mastriano spoke at a far-right Christian conference, Patriots Arise for God and Country, which was organized by “Francine and Allen Fodsick, self-described prophets who have long promoted QAnon”, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. At the outset of the event, organizers played a video “claiming the world is experiencing a ‘great awakening’ that will expose ‘ritual child sacrifice’ and a ‘global satanic blood cult’”. The QAnon conspiracy alleges that top Democratic officials and celebrities are Satan-worshipers running a secret child sex-trafficking ring. The video also featured allegations that 9/11 was a false flag, vaccines are “genocide therapy”, and Hitler faked his death. Last year, the Fodsicks promoted Mastriano on promotional material for the event, but Mastriano said he would not attend. At the time, a spokesman said Mastriano “strongly condemns the ‘Q anon’ conspiracy theory” and “never committed to speak at this event but sadly was used to help promote it with his picture on the invite”. Last month, Mastriano attended as a featured speaker, using his remarks to complain about the “persecution and oppression” he was subjected to for contesting the 2020 presidential election. The Fodsicks auctioned a portrait of Trump for $4,000 during the event, with the proceeds going to Mastriano’s campaign. This year, his campaign did not respond to a request for comment by the Philadelphia Inquirer. In a 31 March appearance at the PA Pro Life Coalition, Mastriano said supporters of abortion rights wanted to “wipe out” Black and Latino communities. He said he believed “that’s a baby from Day 1 – at conception”. Mastriano said “my objective, of course, is to save life at conception and not play games”. In a 27 April debate, Mastriano said opposition to abortion is his “No 1 issue”. The first bill he introduced in the Pennsylvania senate was a “heartbeat” bill – which would ban abortion after six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. But Mastriano said that, as Pennsylvania’s governor, he would “work our way” toward a total abortion ban from conception. Mastriano made clear that he doesn’t support any “exceptions” to abortion bans for rape, incest or life of the mother. Mastriano’s position on abortion reflect his Christian nationalist worldview. Christian nationalism, the New Yorker reports, is rooted in “the idea that God intended America to be a Christian nation”. During his time as a military intelligence officer in Iraq and Afghanistan he “developed a dim view of Islam”. He has frequently “spread Islamophobic memes online”, including “a conspiracy theory that Ilhan Omar, the Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota, directed fellow-Muslims to throw a five-year-old over a balcony”. After retiring from the military and successfully running for office in 2019, Mastriano “began attending events held by a movement called the New Apostolic Reformation”. Members of the New Apostolic Reformation believe “that God speaks to them directly, and that they have been tasked with battling real-world demons who control global leaders”. (Mastriano says he has not “worked directly” with the group.) In the legislature, Mastriano has supported a bill that “would have mandated teaching the Bible in public schools and would have made it legal for adoption agencies to discriminate against same-sex couples”.” Judd Legum is the founder and author of Popular Information, an independent newsletter dedicated to accountability journalism, where this post originally appeared",Opinion/Opinion,Republicans just nominated one of the most radical governor candidates in history | Judd Legum,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/19/republicans-just-nominated-one-of-the-most-radical-governor-candidates-in-history
5/19/2022,"The chief executive of National Grid has weighed into the row over whether to introduce a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers, claiming it would hit investment in renewables and harm customers. John Pettigrew argues a one-off levy to pay to ease the burden of bills would risk damaging Britain’s attempts to cut emissions. Debate is raging over the idea of a windfall tax, amid reports that Boris Johnson and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, are split over how to respond to Labour’s calls for the measure to be introduced to fund help for households hit by soaring bills. Pettigrew told the Guardian on Thursday: “A windfall tax is something that I see as a deterrent for investment when we think about the context of the energy transition that we have going on and the level of investment needed to support the climate change targets … and the increasing desire for energy independence. “It’s really important that we don’t have deterrents on investment for projects, for technology and for job creation. I would worry about a windfall tax doing that.” If such a measure were introduced, it would probably be levied on the profits of North Sea oil and gas firms, rather than National Grid which handles the transportation of energy supplies. Johnson has argued that the tax would deter investment in renewable energy. However, BP has admitted a levy would not stop it from making any of its planned UK investments. Pettigrew added: “I can’t talk for BP and Shell, but I can tell you that for someone who’s investing in assets that are going to be in the ground for 40, 50, 60 years, having a stable regulatory and policy environment is massively important. “The benefits of that stable environment is you are able to raise capital privately, and therefore not put pressure on the public purse at the lowest cost possible, which flows through to customers.” Pettigrew was speaking as National Grid posted an 11% rise in operating profits to nearly £4bn in the 12 months to the end of March, boosted in part by an increase in revenues from subsea cables connecting electricity supply with Europe. Last week the company agreed to bring forward a £200m payment to customers generated from the cables to help households with soaring energy bills. The company embarked on a deal-making spree last year as it bought electricity network Western Power Distribution for £7.9bn and sold 60% of its gas business to Canadian and Australian investors for £4.2bn.",News/Business,"Windfall tax would hit renewables investment, National Grid boss says",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/windfall-tax-would-hit-renewables-investment-national-grid-boss-says
5/19/2022,"Israel will not launch a criminal investigation into the killing of the US-Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Aqleh, which Palestinian officials and witnesses have blamed on Israeli soldiers. According to a report in the Haaretz newspaper the Israel Defense Forces military police branch has accepted the assurances of Israeli troops that they were not aware she was in a village adjacent to the Jenin refugee camp when she was killed on 11 May. The Biden administration and the UN security council have called for a transparent investigation. Abu Aqleh was a household name across the Arab world, known for documenting the hardship of Palestinian life under Israeli rule for Al Jazeera. Her killing received widespread international coverage and prompted criticism from the White House. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, promised her family that Washington would demand that her death be properly investigated. Abu Aqleh was killed during an arrest raid by an Israeli commando unit on Palestinian militants. According to Haaretz, the head of the Commando Brigade, Col Meni Liberty, identified six occasions during the raid when Israeli soldiers opened fire, allegedly at armed Palestinians who were near Abu Aqleh and other journalists. The Israeli military had previously released an account that said it said it could not unequivocally determine the source of the bullet that killed Abu Aqleh. That account speculated the bullet could have been fired by either a Palestinian militant or an Israeli soldier using a “telescopic scope” at 200 metres. Palestinian officials have refused to give the recovered bullet to Israeli authorities to analyse but said it welcomes international investigations. The decision by the Israeli military advocate general, Maj Gen Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, not to order an investigation by the military police criminal investigation division marks a departure from the majority of recent incidents involving IDF shootings of civilians in the occupied West Bank, which have been followed by investigations. At her funeral on Friday police beat mourners carrying her casket, prompting more criticism of Israeli authorities. Last week the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, complained about a lack of Israeli accountability for deaths in the occupied territories. Commenting on Abu Aqleh’s killing and the subsequent violence at her funeral, Bachelet said: “As I have called for many times before, there must be appropriate investigations into the actions of Israeli security forces. “Anyone found responsible should be held to account with penal and disciplinary sanctions commensurate to the gravity of the violation. This culture of impunity must end now.” The Israeli NGO Yesh Din criticised the decision not to investigate, saying that “the army law enforcement mechanisms no longer even bother to give the appearance of investigating”. More than 100 artists, including Hollywood stars, acclaimed authors and prominent musicians, have meanwhile signed a joint letter condemning Abu Aqleh’s killing. Steve Coogan, Kathryn Hahn, Mark Ruffalo, Susan Sarandon and Tilda Swinton were among the signatories to a letter published by Artists for Palestine UK that called for “full accountability for the perpetrators of this crime and everyone involved in authorising it”. An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said: “During arrests undertaken on the Jenin refugee camp, heavy and uncontrolled fire was directed at IDF forces, as were more accurate shooting and the detonation of explosives that damaged army vehicles and occurred close to troops. “The circumstances in which the incident occurred will be studied in an operational investigation being conducted by the head of the commando unit.” The police branch decision came a day after Israeli authorities said they have given the go-ahead for flag-waving Jewish nationalists to march through the heart of the main Palestinian thoroughfare in Jerusalem’s Old City later this month, in a decision that threatens to re-ignite violence in the holy city. The office of the public security minister, Omer Barlev, said the march would take place on 29 May along its “customary route” through Damascus Gate, which is an Arab neighbourhood.The Old City, located in East Jerusalem, has experienced weeks of violent confrontations between Israeli police and Palestinian demonstrators, and the march threatens to trigger new unrest.",News/World news,Israel will not hold criminal inquiry into killing of journalist Shireen Abu Aqleh,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/israel-will-not-hold-criminal-inquiry-into-killing-of-journalist-shireen-abu-aqleh
5/19/2022,"On hearing the Russian rockets hit Kyiv in the early hours of 24 February, Ihor Poshyvailo knew his first responsibility was to get the collection of the Maidan Museum somewhere safe. The artefacts in the art historian’s care are not paintings or sculptures, however, but a hodgepodge of common objects, which catalogue the 2014 Ukrainian “Maidan” revolution that ousted the Putin-friendly government of Viktor Yanukovych. Among more than 4,000 objects now held in a secret location are homemade flags, protest banners, hand-decorated tents and the weapons – including molotov cocktails, baseball bats and purloined police shields – that were used to defend the protesters’ camp in the Maidan square in the centre of Kyiv against heavily armed state security forces. Poshyvailo’s second thought, as the Russian invasion intensified over the past two months, was that the museum again had a responsibility to collect objects: those that might tell the story of the conflict to future generations. “This war is a continuation of Maidan,” Poshyvailo, 54, says. “We are not focused on the military history of the war. That is for other institutions. We try to collect objects that tell symbolic and emotional stories, symbols of the terror and of resistance.” One new acquisition is a rooster-shaped ceramic jug that remained stoically undamaged on a kitchen cabinet high up in a shelled apartment block in the town of Borodyanka. The ornament, made locally, has been adopted as a mascot by the Ukrainian public, to the point that Boris Johnson was presented with a replica of it on his visit to Ukraine last month. The rest of the block was so devastated by Russian firepower that Poshyvailo’s team were forced to use a hydraulic crane to rescue the object. The rooster, collected with the permission of its original owner, is not the only artefact the museum gained from the ruins of the town, located 60km (37 miles) west of the capital. “We documented the kindergarten on one side, the restaurant on the other side. It had been such a peaceful life in that block; these were normal people. The neighbourhood is very representative of post-Soviet families: very simple, very cosy. In one apartment there were a lot of textbooks, maps and the belongings of at least two children. There were books for high school, as well as a dress, left hanging in the wardrobe, of a child of maybe three or four years old. These objects tell the story of lost futures, of hopelessness. “In Bucha we collected some objects that were left behind as people tried to evacuate the city. We collected white textiles, for example, that people had tied to their wing mirrors as they tried to escape: flags of surrender indicating they were just civilians escaping the war. We gathered them from cars with bullet holes along the side, many with bodies still inside. “These objects can become small exhibitions that tell the story of those ordinary people’s lives, of their deaths. They can demonstrate the cruelty but also explain why Ukrainians are fighting so fiercely for their freedom.” Poshyvailo’s mission started in 2014, just a week after the first protesters set up camp in Kyiv’s vast central square. At the time he was the deputy director of the Ivan Honchar Museum, an institution concerned more with traditional musical instruments and religious art than bombs and banners. Frustrated with the lack of response to the protests by colleagues, many of whom felt hamstrung as state employees, Poshyvailo started to visit the occupation in secret. His mission grew as word got out and a team of like-minded curators joined him. “People were surprised, some even suspicious. There was this battle and fight, and we were going in there collecting objects,” he says. After Yanukovych was driven from power and the new government installed, the museum was formalised and received state backing. A design competition was held to build its headquarters, a site in central Kyiv identified and construction was supposed to begin this year. Poshyvailo is under no illusion as to the danger of his continued mission. “Putin is very open in his desire to destroy the revolution of Maidan and therefore the museum is likely to be No 1 on the list to be liquidated. “We know there is a list held by Russian occupiers as to who should be imprisoned first. They will look for military people, politicians, civil activists, but they will also look for cultural workers, especially those like us, who use culture to tell the story of Ukrainian nationhood and our identity.” Two employees of the Melitopol Museum of Local History were reportedly abducted recently after refusing to tell the Russian occupiers the location of objects in the institution’s collection. He says he will not be cowed, however, and is optimistic that Ukraine will win the war and his institution will one day open its doors to the public. “As a historian these times are so strange. It is a mix of worry over everyday safety and precautions; a worry that Kyiv will be attacked, that a nuclear weapon will be used; but there is also this feeling that we are living through a special time and it is our job to preserve this moment.”",Arts/Culture,‘We collect symbols of the resistance’: the Ukrainian museum working through the war,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/19/ukraine-maidan-museum-objects-ihor-poshyvailo-kyiv-cockerel
5/19/2022,"Rebekah Vardy’s agent dropped her phone in the North Sea as part of a concerted effort to destroy evidence, it was alleged on the final day of the “Wagatha Christie” libel trial. Caroline Watt’s phone went over the side of a boat last August while on a family holiday. The incident took place just days after Coleen Rooney’s lawyers asked to search the phone for WhatsApp conversations that could provide potential evidence of stories about Rooney being leaked to the Sun. Watt has maintained it was an unfortunate incident that occurred after the boat hit a wave while she was filming the Scottish coastline. Rooney’s barrister David Sherborne told the high court that it was “far from an accident”. He said it was “inexplicable” that Vardy did not tell her own lawyers for four months that her agent’s phone had ended up on the sea floor. “The story is fishy enough – and no pun intended,” Sherborne said. Vardy previously told the court her side of the same WhatsApp conversations were unavailable, possibly due to her getting a new phone – although she “cannot confirm or deny” that she changed her device. Rooney’s lawyers argue they were manually deleted on purpose. Sherborne alleged that the phone falling into the sea was part of a concerted effort by Vardy to “cover up incriminating evidence”. He alleged Vardy, the wife of the Leicester City footballer, Jamie, and her agent feared both copies of their conversations would be viewed by Rooney’s team and used as evidence. “It was therefore, we say, necessary for both to be destroyed. RIP Ms Watt’s phone,” he added. “If Ms Watt’s phone hadn’t been destroyed then [Vardy’s] messages with her would still have been accessible to us, and the court.” Vardy was present in court for the final day of her multimillion-pound libel trial against Rooney, which she chose to bring after Rooney alleged Vardy was leaking stories from a private Instagram account to the Sun. Rooney and her husband, Wayne, were absent for the first time during the trial after leaving for a family holiday, which was booked with the expectation the trial would finish by Wednesday. Sherborne said Vardy had failed to call key witnesses, including her agent, leaving significant people missing from the case: “We have Hamlet, not just without the prince, but also the entire royal court.” He insisted Vardy had a long history of giving stories to the Sun “about her boob jobs and resting bitch face”, arguing she often sought media attention and passed information to the newspaper. Due to the absence of direct evidence, Rooney’s legal defence has relied on a 300-year-old court ruling, Armory v Delamirie, involving a chimney sweep who found a piece of jewellery while cleaning a fireplace. When the chimney sweep got it valued, a jeweller surreptitiously removed the gems – leaving behind a number of empty sockets. The 1722 legal ruling set a precedent that if the court can tell that evidence is missing, then the assumption should be that what is missing is of the highest possible value that would fit the hole. Rooney’s lawyers argue this precedent applies just as much in a case involving a missing gem in a piece of 18th century jewellery as it does in the case of missing WhatsApp messages sent by a footballer’s wife. Sherborne told the court the messages that were recovered from Vardy’s phone – in which Rooney was allegedly called a “cunt” and a “bitch” – were truly damning and embarrassing. As a result he argued that “one can only imagine how badly [Vardy’s] position would look were the court to have access to what she was able to successfully delete. What remains cannot be anything other than the tip of the iceberg.” He said it was “nonsensical” that Vardy did not try to to pass on information about Rooney to the Sun, and that her only concern was being caught. Sherborne insisted Vardy was equally responsible for leaking the information even if it was her agent who was actually sending the messages: “She is not concerned about doing the dirty – just concerned about being seen to have done it.” The barrister said his client had suffered as a result of Vardy’s insistence on bringing the case: “Mrs Rooney didn’t want to go through a trial, nor did her husband, who described the effect it has had on them and their family.” He stated: “Anyone could be forgiven for wondering why on earth this case has been allowed to get this far.” The case continues.",News/UK news,"Rebekah Vardy’s agent dropped phone in sea to hide evidence, trial hears",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/rebekah-vardys-agent-dropped-phone-in-sea-to-hide-evidence-trial-hears
5/19/2022,"It may be depressing, it may be shocking but, to be honest, it came as no surprise to me: inpatient hospital admissions in England for eating disorders have increased by 84% in the last five years, according to the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Children and young people are the worst affected, with a 90% jump, but adults have also seen a 79% increase in admissions over the same time. These are figures that should shame us – and spur action. An inpatient admission should be an absolute last resort. It involves 24/7 monitoring and weighing, being observed eating timed meals and snacks. Some patients will arrive voluntarily, others will be there because they have been sectioned. It should be the end of the line treatment when a patient’s life is seriously at risk. The huge rise in admissions means that people are suffering alone without support for such a long time that their lives are at risk before anyone intervenes. That cannot be right. I was terrified when I was admitted into hospital with an eating disorder. It did the job of saving my life but I became very institutionalised while I was in there – my life was completely on hold. Eating disorders are one of the deadliest mental illnesses but the funding and support they receive has never met the demand. The government seems intent on blaming the pandemic for the recent rise in people of all ages receiving treatment, which ignores that we are where we are due to a lifetime of underfunding of services and research and years of dangerous health initiatives such as calorie counting on menus that have normalised disordered eating. Eating disorders are also a hugely stigmatised illness. They are often seen as a lifestyle choice, a phase, or something that a person will grow out of, rather than an insidious and dangerous mental illness that has complex roots and manifestations. There is still an assumption that they only affect white teenage emaciated girls – just look at hospital admissions for black, Asian and minority ethnic people, which are increasing more rapidly than those of white ethnicities, to see how invisible eating disorders are in these communities until they becomes life-threatening. Stigma increases the shame that many people feel, but also stops many from reaching out for support – which is a massively difficult thing to do when your mental illness is telling you not to – which of course then contributes to high mortality rates. So many people go to their GP or end up in hospital A&E departments only to be told, “You aren’t thin enough to have an eating disorder” or, “You don’t look like you have an eating disorder.” That is why I have spent years on a campaign called #DumpTheScales to ban minimum BMI limits for treatment, which many NHS trusts have in place, which only encourage people with restrictive eating disorders to lose even more weight to be deemed worthy of treatment. I hear all the time from people who have been told by their GPs that they can’t have an eating disorder because of their weight, age, ethnicity or gender. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is today launching new guidelines to help healthcare workers identify eating disorders – which range from anorexia and bulimia to binge eating disorder and eating disorders not otherwise specified – in good time to mitigate the worst effects such as heart failure, osteoporosis and infertility to name just a few. While I applaud these guidelines, the only way things will really change is with proper funding for early intervention programmes, treatment and research. Between 2009 and 2019, total UK funding for eating disorder research was just £1.13 per person affected per year, according to the charity Beat. And despite inpatient admissions spiralling, the number of beds in NHS mental health hospitals has fallen by 25% since 2010. This is a crisis and we need to prevent lives being lost as a matter of urgency. Nobody should be dying of an eating disorder in 2022. With proper support and long-term treatment, recovery is possible. But it is a long road, which requires long-term support and community-based treatment. Inpatient care is expensive, it is necessary at times, but only when all other options have been exhausted. We know that early intervention saves lives and money so why are we still intent on waiting for people to hit crisis point before helping them? However, what these statistics fail to show us is the number of people who are struggling without a diagnosis. Those living with eating disorders, in some situations perhaps functioning at a high level, hidden in plain sight, their lives utter misery. Remember as you scroll through the news today, taking in these headlines, that behind every one of these statistics is a face, a person, a name, with a network of family, friends, loved ones who are all devastated by eating disorders.

5/19/2022,"Russia has said a further 771 Ukrainian troops have “surrendered” at Mariupol’s besieged Azovstal steelworks, bringing the total number to 1,730 fighters this week, while the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it has started registering the Ukrainian prisoners of war who left the plant this week. The Russian defence ministry said that 80 soldiers who surrendered in the past day were wounded and were being treated in hospitals in the Russian-held cities of Novoazovsk and Donetsk. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said on Wednesday that more than 900 Azovsteel troops had been sent to a former prison colony in the town of Olenivka but it was not immediately clear where the latest group to surrender had gone. Ukraine has not commented on the evacuation of the soldiers since Tuesday, when Ukraine’s deputy defence minister stated that the soldiers would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, without providing further details. It is also not clear how many soldiers remain inside the plant. Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk, said on Thursday that more than half the Ukrainian fighters in the bunkers below the Azovstal steel plant have surrendered. Pushilin also repeated statements made earlier by other Russian officials that the soldiers should be tried. “Let them surrender, let them live, let them honestly face the charges for all their crimes,” Pushilin said. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, earlier assured the combatants would be treated in line with international norms for POWs, though several senior Russian lawmakers demanded they be put on trial and one even called for their execution. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has not publicly commented on the fate of the soldiers since their evacuation started on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the ICRC said it has registered “hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war” this week from the Azovstal plant. “The ICRC started on Tuesday 17 May to register combatants leaving the Azovstal plant, including the wounded, at the request of the parties. The operation continued Wednesday and was still ongoing Thursday. The ICRC is not transporting POWs to the places where they are held,” the Geneva-based humanitarian agency, which has experience in working with prisoners of war, said in a statement. “In accordance with the mandate given to the ICRC by states under the 1949 Geneva conventions, the ICRC must have immediate access to all POWs in all places where they are held. The ICRC must be allowed to interview prisoners of war without witnesses, and the duration and frequency of these visits should not be unduly restricted,” the agency added. Several Russian outlets and pro-Kremlin telegram channels reporter on Thursday that some Ukrainian soldiers from the Azovstal plant have already been transported outside of Donbas to Russian territories. According to 161, a local news outlet, 89 Ukrainian soldiers have been transferred to a detainment facility in the Russian border city of Taganrog where they will face extremism charges in military court for fighting in the Azov regiment, one of the main forces defending the steelworks. Readovka, an outlet with links to the Kremlin, said that the deputy commander of the Azov regiment, Cptn Svyatoslav Palamar, who during the siege of the plant made several video appeals urging world leaders to organise an evacuation, was transported to the Russian city of Rostov. The Guardian was not able to independently verify both claims. The Azov regiment was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine, and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. Since then, the unit has been integrated into the Ukrainian national guard and the regiment now denies being fascist, racist or neo-Nazi. The Azov movement has been used as a key part of the Russian propaganda narrative to justify the war in Ukraine. Next week, Russia’s supreme court will hear an application to designate Ukraine’s Azov regiment as a “terrorist organisation”, opening the way for sentences of up to 20 years for those convicted of involvement. Experts believe that a trial of the Ukrainian troops, described by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as “heroes”, would further complicate efforts to resume the stalled peace negotiations.",News/World news,Russia says 771 more Ukrainian troops ‘surrendered’ at Mariupol steelworks,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/russia-says-771-more-ukrainian-troops-surrendered-at-mariupol-steelworks
5/19/2022,"In the early evening of Saturday 20 November last year, 18-year-old Bobbi-Anne McLeod told her father, Adrian, she loved him and left the family home in Plymouth to catch a bus, planning to meet her boyfriend. McLeod was 1.57 metres (5ft 2in) tall, slightly built and could easily have been mistaken for someone several years her junior. Even if she had spotted Cody Ackland sneak up behind her as she waited at the bus stop, she probably would not have stood much of a chance against his savage attack. Ackland was strong, determined and organised. In the months, possibly years, leading up to this point he had researched the techniques and tactics used by the American serial killer Ted Bundy, whose modus operandi was to approach a victim in a public place, render her unconscious and take her to a second place before killing her. Ackland, 24, struck McLeod on the head with a claw hammer he had brought along just for this purpose. Their eyes, he has claimed, briefly met and the teenager fell to the ground. He bundled McLeod into the footwell of his car and travelled 19 miles to a car park at Bellever Forest on Dartmoor. There he carried out a frenzied hammer attack on McLeod, causing “catastrophic” injuries. Police cannot be sure but they believe she died there. Ackland began to try to cover his tracks. He burned her handbag, put McLeod’s body in his boot and drove 28 miles to a wooded lane leading to Bovisand beach in south Devon, a place he knew because he partied there. In May last year – six months before the attack – Ackland posted a picture of a roaring driftwood fire on the beach with the caption: “Capture them moments.” He stripped McLeod, removed most of her jewellery and dumped the body 5 metres (15ft) down a steep bank before driving home and going to bed. McLeod’s boyfriend had raised the alarm. Her mobile phone and AirPods were found near the bus stop and friends, family and police began to search for her. On Sunday 21 November Ackland drove to a village outside Plymouth where he threw the hammer into a river and hid a carrier bag containing bloodstained clothing in allotments. Later that Sunday, he went into Plymouth, had a pizza, rehearsed with his indie rock band, Rakuda – he was the songwriter and guitarist – and drank into the early hours of Monday 22 November at a lock-in. Bizarrely, friends reported he seemed “happier than usual”. He was usually seen as dour and serious, but this night he was chatting, laughing and hugging friends, as excited as he was on band gig nights. Next day he went to a cinema to see the sci-fi film Dune. On the afternoon of Tuesday 23 November Ackland suddenly left his workplace, a car valet business. He sent messages to friends, family and bandmates telling them he loved them, walked into Charles Cross police station, Plymouth, and told staff: “I did it. I’m responsible.” He asked for a map and pointed to the spot where he had left McLeod’s body. During extraordinary interviews, Ackland told police he had a tendency to “overthink” things. On the evening of the murder he said he was feeling “wound up” and “needed to get out”. He claimed he had come across McLeod, whom he did not know, by chance. He insisted his motive was not sexual, though he did say she looked like girls he had dated. He claimed he had stripped her so that she would be harder to identify if found. Ackland claimed that after the initial attack he thought about taking her to hospital but decided he needed to kill her and described his method as workmanlike, “industrial”. He showed little emotion when being interviewed, only once welling up briefly. Detectives were shocked not just by the brutality of the crime but by Ackland’s apparently blameless background. He had never been in trouble with the police and was considered by everyone as clever and thoughtful. He lived quietly with his mother. But when they examined his phone, detectives found he had been living a double life. He had a “morbid” interest in serial killers, particularly Bundy, who killed at least 30 young women and girls in the 1970s. Images of Bundy and the weapons he used were among 3,000 disturbing images including dismembered bodies, postmortems and murder scenes Ackland had collected. In the days before the murder, Ackland had researched possible sites on Dartmoor where a body could be disposed of, and searched for hammers, crowbars, cutting tools, baseball bats, ski masks, balaclavas and waterproof clothing. When he was interviewed, Ackland told police killing had not been on his mind because it was “so out there”. Afterwards he said it had been like a film or fantasy and it felt like someone else had committed the crime. He was not in contact with mental health authorities as an adult. He complained to police that he had suffered during his childhood, always getting the “dirty end of the stick”. His father, David, a former soldier and stunt driver, and mother, Helen, split up when he was a child – but police have found no trigger that explains why he turned into a killer. Psychiatrists examined him in prison but found no mental illness that would allow him to plead diminished responsibility in court. He had no choice but to plead guilty to murder.",News/UK news,Murderer of Bobbi-Anne McLeod was fascinated with killer Ted Bundy,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/murderer-of-bobbi-anne-mcleod-cody-ackland-was-fascinated-with-killer-ted-bundy
5/19/2022,"A man who was morbidly fascinated with the American serial killer Ted Bundy has been jailed for a minimum of 30 years after admitting the savage murder of the teenager Bobbi-Anne McLeod, who vanished as she waited for a bus in Plymouth. Cody Ackland, a 24-year-old rock musician, attacked 18-year-old McLeod with a claw hammer in November last year before kidnapping her and carrying out a prolonged attack in a forest, causing “catastrophic” injuries to her head and face. Ackland then drove 28 miles, stripped McLeod and dumped her body close to a beach. In subsequent days he went out with friends and rehearsed with his band, appearing more joyful and affectionate than usual. Three days later he handed himself in and detectives were shocked to find a cache of 3,000 graphic images on his phone revealing his obsession with Bundy, other serial killers and crime scenes. Ackland was not known to police, and friends had no idea of his obsession, but detectives believe he went out looking to kill a stranger. Prosecutors said the similarities between what he did and Bundy’s modus operandi – approaching victims in public places, knocking them out and taking them to a remote spot to kill them – was significant. After the sentencing, McLeod’s mother, Donna, father, Adrian, and her brother Lee, released a statement paying tribute to “a beautiful girl who lit up our lives and the lives of everyone she ever met”. They said: “She was kind, funny and loyal. She was the best daughter, the best sister, and the best friend to so many people. Everybody who knew Bobbi loved her. Cody Ackland has taken away our world. We will never see her beautiful face or hear her laugh, see her get married or have the children she so wanted. Her not being here is still unimaginable. “We have not been able to say goodbye to Bobbi-Anne and we can only imagine the things he did to her – the thoughts are continually going around in our minds. Why Bobbi-Anne? Why make her suffer? To know her final hours were spent being tortured destroys us inside.” Det Supt Mike West, the head of Devon and Cornwall police’s major crime branch, said there were “clear parallels” between Ackland and Bundy and it was an “exceptional event” for someone with no previous convictions to have acted as he did. “There was no trigger event, there was no escalation of behaviour, there is no indication, whether it be police records or anecdotal information or evidence from anyone that knew him, that there could be any suspicion or concern he could have done anything like this,” he said. In the days before the attack, Ackland researched tools, weapons and possible sites to dispose of a body. West said: “My professional, personal opinion is, he went out with the intent to kill.” West said he thought it was possible Ackland could have killed again. “Whether his desires would have been sated by the attack on Bobbi-Anne, I don’t know.” He called for anyone with concerns about Ackland in the past to come forward. There was no scientific evidence to suggest McLeod was sexually assaulted and Ackland insisted this was not his motive. He said he stripped her to try to hide her identity. The senior crown advocate Richard Posner told Plymouth crown court: “His interest in the macabre presents as deep-rooted; a fascination with death, murder and murderers, and the means to commit murder.” He had hoarded extreme and graphic images of dead and dismembered people, bodies of murder victims, postmortem examinations, deposition sites and artefacts linked to murders, such as weapons. Posner added: “There are numerous images of the American serial killer Ted Bundy in his telephone, and images of weapons he used to kill his victims. Bundy approached his victims in public places and knocked them unconscious before killing them. It is not a coincidence that Bobbi-Anne McLeod met her fate the same way.” Ackland, from Plymouth, admitted murdering McLeod after seizing her from a bus stop close to her home on the evening of Saturday 20 November 2021.",News/UK news,Man obsessed with serial killer jailed for murder of teenager Bobbi-Anne McLeod,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/man-24-jailed-for-of-plymouth-teenager-bobbi-anne-mcleod-cody-ackland

Ten Hag has been holding meetings and conversations with club staff this week but will not be involved in preparation or selection for the the final Premier League match, which will be overseen by Ralf Rangnick. Ten Hag, who left his role with Ajax after winning the title, has been involved in planning for transfers and pre-season.

5/19/2022,"My friend Roy Haddon, who has died aged 79, was devoted to improving the housing conditions of those living in and around the city of York. Roy embraced modern thinking, and had a strong and absolute sense of moral integrity. He was not a bystander. Roy realised the importance of people’s housing needs, and his successful tenure at York Housing Association, from 1977 until 1991, demonstrated this. He was instrumental in establishing the organisation and served as its first general manager. The foundation on which York’s social housing is built owes much to Roy’s vision and leadership. He also demonstrated progressive ideas about how best to support the housing needs of disabled people This reflected his political commitment: he was a member of CND and of the Labour party, and he was a volunteer worker in the 1960s with the groundbreaking Notting Hill Housing Trust, which is where his interest in housing issues and inequality first took shape. Roy was born in Rothwell, Northamptonshire. His father, Frederick, was a carpenter and his mother, Florence (nee Joyce), an accounts clerk, and he had three sisters, Eileen, Jennet and Rosemary. He enjoyed a happy childhood, playing cricket in the back garden with both family and friends, and honing his skills as a spin bowler. Later, once settled in York, he played for many years with Clifton Alliance Hospital Cricket Club. After leaving school in 1960, Roy went to work with HM Customs and Excise in London, but returned to education in 1966, gaining a first in sociology from Canterbury University, then an MA in sociology at Hull University. He joined the University of York as a lecturer in sociology in 1970. Roy had a lifetime ambition to help the less fortunate, the homeless, refugees and asylum seekers, and this led him to York Housing Association. He also supported a range of voluntary organisations, including Juniper Communities, which provided care to people with learning disabilities, and more recently worked at Refugee Action York His work and voluntary interests reflected his longstanding commitment to social justice, and a strong compassion. This never left him. He loved reading, jazz and spending his free time walking the South West Coast Path, at Hadrian’s Wall, and in the Lake District, Scotland and Wales. He was a genuine, kind-hearted and loyal innovator. Roy is survived by Rosemary and Jennet.",News/Society,Roy Haddon obituary ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/19/roy-haddon-obituary
5/19/2022,"Scientists have identified more than 3,000 potentially harmful chemicals that can be found in food packaging and other food-related materials, two-thirds of which were not previously known to be in contact with food. An international group of scientists analyzed more than 1,200 scientific studies where chemicals had been measured in food packaging, processing equipment, tableware and reusable food containers. A report released Thursday by the Food Packaging Forum, a Switzerland-based non-profit, noted little is known about many of the 3,240 chemicals examined in these studies or their effects on people. Manufacturers are either intentionally or unintentionally adding these chemicals to packaging and other equipment, said Pete Myers, a report co-author and founder and chief scientist of Environmental Health Sciences, a nonprofit advocacy group. Either way, many of those chemicals are ending up in the human body, he said. “If we don’t know what it is, we don’t know its toxicity,” Myers said. “The mix of chemicals is just too complicated to allow us to regulate them safely.” The new analysis, published in the journal Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, comes amid growing concerns about exposure to potentially toxic chemicals in food and water. The Food Packaging Forum has created a searchable database with the chemicals found in the packaging and equipment, known as food contact materials. While many of the chemicals on the list are known hazards such as phthalates and PFAS, others have not been adequately studied, the group said, and their health effects are unclear. Researchers were shocked to find chemicals in food contact materials that consumers could have no knowledge of. Just one third of the chemicals studied appeared in a previously compiled database of more than 12,000 chemicals associated with the manufacturing of food contact materials. Previous studies have found potentially dangerous PFAS “forever chemicals” in food packaging. Those chemicals have been linked to a list of health problems. Nearly two-thirds of the studies analyzed in the new report looked at chemicals in plastic. Packaging manufacturers often add chemicals without knowing the long-term ramifications, said Jessica Heiges, a UC Berkeley doctoral candidate who studies disposable food items such as plasticware and packaging and was not involved in the report. The chemicals “are terrifying because we don’t know what their impacts are”, Heiges said. “What’s most alarming is this cocktail of chemicals, how they’re interacting with each other. Some of them are persisting in the environment and in our bodies as we’re consuming them.” It’s likely many of those unknown chemicals are harmful, said Alastair Iles, an associate professor in UC Berkeley’s environmental science, policy and management department, also not involved with the study. “The report only underlines our gross ignorance when it comes to the chemicals that people are being exposed to every day,” he said. “If we didn’t know that there were so many chemicals in packages, what does that say about our knowledge about chemical risks?”",News/World news,"More than 3,000 potentially harmful chemicals found in food packaging",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/more-than-3000-potentially-harmful-chemicals-food-packaging-report-shows
