2/23/2022,"Neil Jenkins has cited criticism, both within the camp and from external sources, as a motivating factor for the Wales captain, Dan Biggar, as he led the team to a much-needed victory against Scotland which revived their defence of the Six Nations title. Biggar drop-kicked his team to a 20-17 win in Cardiff in their last match after a crescendo of criticism ensued from the champions’ crushing opening defeat by Ireland the week before.  When asked to pinpoint some of the attributes that have contributed to Biggar’s longevity at the highest level in the buildup to the match against England at Twickenham this weekend, Jenkins was refreshingly forthright. “Sometimes you can use that as fuel,” the Wales kicking coach and former fly-half said of the judgments passed on the team. “No doubt Dan will use that to his advantage.” Jenkins’s reply was unusual in that athletes and coaches routinely roll out platitudes in modern press conferences centred on “processes” and “controllables”. The aim is to be like Teflon, repelling the outside world from the sanctimony of the inner circle. But after the 29-7 defeat in Dublin, the clamour beyond the gate filtered through. Much of the backlash focused on the apparent weakness of the tight five, particularly their inability to offer a threat while carrying. Speaking on the BBC’s Six Nations Special podcast, Sam Warburton, the former grand slam-winning captain,, was clear in his damnation. “Wales don’t have that front five who can carry and break the gainline,” he said. Of course the opposition played a role but Wales’s tight five made three more carries and nine more metres in Edinburgh than they achieved in Dublin. They also secured clean ball from all 12 of their lineout throws with the tighthead Tomas Francis scoring from the back of a rolling maul. “It wasn’t the criticism from outside [that spurred the team on], it was criticism from ourselves as a pack,” was Francis’s view. “We hadn’t turned up [against Ireland]. You just have to get the mindset right. Everyone in the squad is a good player. It’s about trying to get that cohesion as a pack and get in the game.” Francis and Jenkins are aware of the cultural significance whenever Wales face England at Twickenham. But they have lost each of their past five games in south-west London. Their last win at the ground came in 2015, ending England’s run at their own World Cup at the group stage. “That was one of the best days of my career,” Francis said of his fourth international appearance. If they are to relive that glorious day, Wales will need to match England’s mongrel. The set-piece and maul look potent but questions remain at midfield. Jenkins was non‑committal about who might fill that channel but acknowledged that they would have a difficult job keeping Manu Tuilagi quiet. The Sale centre looks primed to start and will cause havoc if he gets front-foot ball from Marcus Smith inside him. This is why the performances of Francis and his meatier compatriots will be crucial. They will be bolstered by the likely return of Taulupe Faletau in the back row but, without ascendancy at the front line, the rest of the team may fold. “Whoever plays for Wales has to have the mindset that you’re going to go and dominate,” Francis said. “[England] will be a great test. They have great forwards.” He knows many of them well and has roots in England. Francis was born in York, attended the University of Leeds and represented Doncaster Knights, London Scottish and Exeter Chiefs before joining Ospreys last year. He referenced Ellis Genge’s fondness for “mind games” in the scrum and commended Joe Marler’s “resurgence”. He also expressed his sympathy for his old club-mate in Devon, Luke Cowan-Dickie, whose mistake under the high ball proved decisive in England’s loss at Murrayfield. Not that he will be concerned with that this week. As Jenkins stressed “you have to be incredibly physical” when playing at Twickenham. Having heard as much criticism as they can tolerate, Wales have all the fuel they need.",Sport/Sport,‘Use that as fuel’: Biggar and Wales motivated by criticism in Six Nations,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/23/use-that-as-fuel-biggar-and-wales-motivated-by-criticism-in-six-nations
2/23/2022,"Design sometimes feels like a constant search for a better, brighter way to live life. A quest for new and innovative alternatives to the status quo. But, increasingly, is is the past that is presenting solutions. Two of this month’s stories look at revival rather than invention. Industrial designer Souhaib Ghanmi is investigating new ways to use animal bone. Currently categorised as a waste product of animal farming, this traditional material can also be used as a electrical and thermal insulator that’s also biodegradable. A great alternative to plastic. The traditional water storage solutions of India are being similarly reappraised. Renovating historical wells and tanks may combat climate change and provide the solution to current water shortages.  It looks like we’re finally learning, new isn’t always better. “Plastic is one of the world’s biggest pollutants,” says Swiss Tunisian industrial designer Souhaib Ghanmi. “So I was interested in finding a potential substitute. In the past, bone was used as an equivalent to plastic, so it seems obvious to return to it.” His father came from a family who worked with cattle and Ghanmi had grown up watching his uncle use cow bones to make knife handles. A far better fate for a slaughterhouse byproduct than incineration. “Bone is not exploited enough, in spite of its numerous properties. It’s an electrical and thermal insulator – and it’s biodegradable.” Ghanmi’s recycling research took beautiful shape for his diploma project, Elos, created during his time at the École cantonale d’art de Lausanne. The Elos range of light switches and plug sockets are made with bone powder, and the plug socket design is inspired by the articulated action of the femur bone rotating in the hip socket. This pivoting creation not only looks elegant, but the added flexibility stops cables stretching and fraying. “I’m questioning the use of bones which are currently just causing pollution when they’re burned,” explains Ghanmi. “We should make maximum use of these animals.” A new exhibition, Misshapes, celebrates the work of British jewellery label Tatty Devine. Next month, Hove Museum & Art Gallery will host the touring retrospective of work by Harriet Vine and Rosie Wolfenden, whose laser-cut acrylic necklaces have been style staples since they started their label in 2001. Over the years, Tatty Devine has made eclectic pendants and earrings in the shape of zips, lobsters, melon slices, typewriters and almost anything else you can think of. The aesthetic is fun but powerful, with a feminist slant. The label tends to collaborate with organisations such as the Fawcett Society and Young Women’s Trust, rather than fashion labels. Vine and Wolfenden met and clicked while studying at Chelsea College of Art & Design and then, in 1999, after graduation, Wolfenden was working at a vintage clothes shop when a browsing Vogue stylist asked where she got her headband. Wolfenden said it was from her own collection – and then had to design and make a collection, together with Vine, over the weekend when the stylist asked to see her work. This started a long collaboration with British Vogue, which frequently featured their accessories. A Tatty Devine cuff appeared on the magazine’s millennium cover, worn by Erin O’Connor. Misshapes will feature over 100 pieces from the 23 years of Tatty Devine, from leather cuffs to their most popular necklaces. Hedley Swain of Royal Pavilion & Museums Trust said: “We are so thrilled to have Tatty Devine at Hove Museum. Its work matches Brighton and Hove style beautifully. We want to develop the museum as the local home for creativity and making, so this exhibition is a perfect match.” Misshapes is at Hove Museum from 5 March While modernisation is often seen as a solution to infrastructure problems, the World Monuments Fund (WMF) is looking into India’s ingenious traditional water storage systems to see whether renovations could be a better answer to water access issues. WMF is an independent organisation dedicated to preserving cultural heritage in diverse communities around the world, and the historic water capture methods in India are unique. Saving everything from monsoon deluges to agricultural runoff was achieved through sophisticated reservoirs, tanks and ponds. Systems were often particular to each region, as drought and flood conditions varied so much. Some structures, such as jhalaras and bawaris, look as if they’re designed by Escher. Many have fallen into disrepair. During the Empire, the British replaced the local authorities with a pan-Indian, centrally organised water system. This was based on land ownership, rather than community needs, and took control of the water supply out of the hands of women who had collected and overseen these domestic arrangements. The WMF will assess whether the traditional structures, such as the Taj Bawdi water tank in Bijapur, can be renovated to fulfil local needs once more. “As climate change intensifies around the world, impacting our built environment, WMF India is committed to working with communities to develop solutions,” says Amita Baig, WMF India executive director. “We look forward to developing this important initiative aimed at increasing access to clean water for communities across India.” Sign up for the monthly Design Review newsletter Collect, the Crafts Council’s fair, takes place at London’s Somerset House this week. As the Crafts Council celebrates its 50th anniversary, Collect consolidates its reputation as one of the leading international fairs for living makers. After going online for the last two years, 2022 promises some spectacles to see in person, such as Fung+Bedford’s glorious origami sculptures, as well as talks and events with textile artist Alice Kettle and Loewe Foundation Craft Prize finalists including jeweller Edu Tarin, embroidery expert Celia Pym and sculptor David Corvalán. Collect will also feature new artists, such as Amanda McCavour who is presenting a cascade of embroidered poppies. Jemma Gowland’s feminist porcelain figurines and Caron Penney’s tapestries will also be on show. The youngest exhibitor Jasmine Linington, showing with Craft Scotland, makes sustainable seaweed fibre textile pieces. “We’re delighted to be returning to a physical fair at Somerset House,’’ says fair director Isobel Dennis. “It’s an exceptional environment for contemporary craft.” The Collect Fair takes place 25-27 February at Somerset House and on Artsy.net until 6 March When a new pop-up LBGTQ+ community centre opened in London last December, it was with an interior that was not only welcoming but extremely chic. The former shop in Southwark had been designed by queer architect Martha Rawlinson and fitted out by a crew of LBGTQ+ builders but, when it came to furniture, the team wanted to be sustainable while creating a welcoming environment. The centre was, after all, a sober sanctuary, a place for groups combating isolation in the queer community, bringing different generations together in a friendly setting and offering LGBTQ+-specific services, such as sexual health testing and mental health support. Communications agency Zetteler put out a call to the design industry and received an overwhelming response. Furniture maker Benchmark donated 10 bespoke café tables in solid oak. Eames chairs arrived from The Office Group and Anglepoise gave 10 lamps. Universal Design Studio provided 15 of Vitra’s colourful Tip Ton chairs. Many others gave very generously. “We wanted the space to be bright and homely, but to have as little impact on the planet as possible,” says Sarah Moore, volunteer director of the centre. “We wrote a sustainability statement along with our furniture call-out, and Zetteler’s clients and contacts helped us source the most amazing items.” The Southwark centre is a six-month pilot but there are hopes this will become a permanent project. The watch industry is big business, but it is not one built on innovation. The famous Swiss brands release new watches on a weekly basis, but such newness typically amounts to little more than a different coloured dial or slightly smaller case. There was one freelance watch designer, though, who made innovation his business. Gérald Genta considered himself an artist before he considered himself a watch designer – he is said to have sketched out 100,000 ideas in his lifetime, and delighted in the nickname “the Picasso of watchmaking”. It’s no exaggeration to say some of Genta’s most celebrated designs from the mid-70s – the octagonal-shaped Royal Oak, for the brand Audemars Piguet; the steel Nautilus for Patek Philippe, the first “luxury sports watch” – remain cornerstones of those brand’s businesses today. Genta died in 2011 and his estate is overseen by Evelyne Genta, his widow, whose diplomatic day job has the unimprovable title of Ambassador of the Principality of Monaco to the Court of St James’s to the United Kingdom. There will be a lot of Genta activity this year, including an exhibition. It is also the 50th anniversary of his Royal Oak, something Audemars Piguet will be making noise about. First up, Evelyne is auctioning off a selection of her husband’s remarkable freehand paintings; first at Sotheby’s in Geneva until February 24, then Hong Kong in March and New York in April. In May, Genta’s own personal Royal Oak will go under the hammer. That has a pre-sale estimate of $300,000 to $500,000. Pictures of watches aren’t for everyone but we urge you to at least a look at Sotheby’s Gérald Genta: Icon of Time, if only to transport yourself back to a time of true watchmaking craftsmanship, an era before telling the time was just another app on the now ubiquitous Apple Watch.

2/23/2022,"The number of passengers travelling through Heathrow airport fell to 19.4 million in 2021, its lowest level for nearly 50 years, the airport has said as it reported a pre-tax loss of £1.8bn. As a result, its cumulative losses during the pandemic have reached £3.8bn, despite having cut £870m in costs, as international travel was disrupted by travel restrictions, and Covid testing and quarantine requirements.  The airport said it was the only European hub to see a reduction in traffic last year, falling to levels last seen in 1972, which it blamed on tighter restrictions in the UK than EU countries. Cargo, which was mainly carried on passenger planes, was 12% lower than pre-pandemic levels. Heathrow has had a weaker start to the year than it anticipated, as 23% fewer passengers than forecast passed through the airport in January and February. However, it expects a surge of Britons to head off on holiday over the summer and is sticking to its forecast of 45.5 million passengers in 2022, more than double the number last year. Heathrow is ramping up its operations in expectation of a surge of passengers heading to sunny destinations, and is planned to reopen Terminal 4 by July. The removal of Covid testing requirements has increased demand among UK travellers, the airport said, although tourism and travel to the UK from overseas remains suppressed as a result of Covid measures in other countries. The airports’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, described 2021 as “the worst year in Heathrow’s history”, but added: “Demand is now starting to recover and we are working closely with airlines to scale-up our operations.” The airport said it does not expect travel to return to pre-pandemic levels until all restrictions have been removed, allowing passengers to travel without any Covid checks, and with confidence that restrictions will not be reintroduced. However, those who do begin to travel again are likely to find it more expensive, after Heathrow outlined plans to increase its passenger charges, meaning ticket prices will rise by just under 2%. “We will work with airlines to make sure that we can bring down the costs over time. This is only a temporary adjustment while we come through the recovery phase then we look to bring costs down as we get beyond the Covid period,” Holland-Kaye told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. He said he did not expect passenger numbers to return to pre-Covid levels until 2025 or 2026. “Passengers need to be confident and that’s not going to happen if we have another variant of concern,” he said.",News/Business,Passengers using Heathrow airport fall to lowest level since 1972,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/23/covid-passengers-using-heathrow-airport-falls-to-lowest-level-since-1972
2/23/2022,"A barista course spruiked by the national disability insurance scheme and for which a company pocketed nearly $1m from the federal government lacked the most basic equipment, an inquiry has been told. Over a three-day hearing this week, the disability royal commission is investigating the troubled Disability Employment Services program, a $1.4bn a year federal government scheme that pays companies and non-profits to get hundreds of thousands of people with disability into work.  On Wednesday, counsel assisting the commission, Kate Eastman SC, raised the case of BusyBeans, a barista training course for people with disability run by health services company Rehab Management and a connected employment service provider, AimBig. Despite a significant flow of taxpayer funds, the inquiry heard allegations at least one of the several BusyBeans training centres had “no established policies, procedures, safety measures or proper facilities to train the participants”. It also heard claims participants were referred to the training from its other employment services program, likely triggering a payment from the government for getting the person into work or training. Representatives from AimBig, Rehab Management and their holding company, Arriba Group, are yet to respond and will give evidence later this week. Mzia* is a former jobseeker in the disability employment services program who lives with ADHD. She had been working in retail since she was 14, and had experience as a barista, but no formal qualifications. She told the royal commission she found a job advertisement for a barista trainer and asked her AimBig consultant for help applying, only to learn the BusyBeans program was effectively run by the same company. Despite saying she found the job herself, she said she was asked to sign documents saying her employment consultant had found her the position. Mzia said she had high hopes for the new job, but these were not matched by the reality. Mzia claimed on her first day in May, 2019, she arrived to find the only equipment was a home coffee machine and a bottle of long life milk. She alleged that when she complained about the provisions, she was initially given a Coles petrol voucher to buy “proper milk, a jug and bucket”, before being told to buy the equipment herself, and she would be reimbursed. She says she felt forced to obtain an advance Centrelink payment to buy some of the equipment necessary for her work and there was no induction or training on the first day. She alleges she had to create the entire training program from scratch. “I thought it would be a lot more set up, a lot more supplies, like basic requirements,” she said. Throughout this period, Mzia was still receiving job advice from her AimBig consultant, which she believed was a “conflict of interest”. She says she was asked to assess AimBig’s jobseekers to see if they were suitable for BusyBeans. The inquiry heard Mzia’s own employment consultant would put participants from the disability employment services forward for BusyBeans. “Sometimes you decided that the participants [the consultant] put forward for the program were not suitable, or there was not enough space in the program, but you felt that [the consultant] was bullying and intimidating you,” Eastman said, summarising her statement to the inquiry. The inquiry heard the program began in March 2019 and had 167 paid participants and 38 unpaid work experience participants a year later, when it was suspended due to Covid. The inquiry heard AimBig received $874,832 in payments from the federal government for BusyBeans participants. Another company, TLH, received $111,000 in wage subsidies from AimBig as part of the program, the hearing was told. Mzia said she was never given training specific to working with people with disability or an adequate position description. She resigned in March 2020 after a period of sick leave due to the stress of the job between October 2019 and January 2020. She had been initially classified as having a “benchmark” of working 15 hours per week due to her disability, but had been working 30 hours a week with BusyBeans, initially at $25 an hour, though this was later increased to $30 per hour. Mzia said she started trying to find her students employment in hospitality, telling the commission: “I felt I had to do something because no one else was helping the participants.” Participants were supposed to be making coffee for Rehab Management staff, but the inquiry heard there were not enough employees so the jobseekers would be “stuck in the office five hours a day, three days a week, just standing in the front of the Breville machine”. Eastman said the inquiry would examine whether “AimBig provided adequate and appropriate post placement support to Mzia” and whether there was a conflict between its role as her employment consultant and her employer, among other issues. Last year, Guardian Australia revealed a damning consultants’ report that discovered myriad problems with the disability employment services program, including that providers were funnelling participants into courses rather than work in order to claim bonus payments.

2/23/2022,"You’re not meant to envy your parents, but Christina Patterson couldn’t help envying hers. A Swedish mum with a Mona Lisa smile and love of cakes, coffee and conversation; an English dad with matinee idol good looks and a prestigious Foreign Office career; their love-at-first-sight romance; their glamorous postings to Bangkok and Rome before they settled in Surrey, where Christina and her two older siblings, Tom and Caroline, grew up. They made life seem so easy, as if it were one long holiday and happiness came as naturally as leaves to a tree.  As Patterson sorts through cine films and photo albums, the reader feels envious too – of the golden childhood she had, the magic shows put on in the front garden, the summer holidays in Sweden, the “warmth and love and laughter”. Then you realise that she’s remembering all this while clearing the family house. And that she’s having to learn to refer to Tom in the past tense. And that one reluctantly recalled aspect of childhood – the terrible scenes caused by her “skinny, sensitive, beautiful sister” Caroline – feels very ominous. The book is subtitled “a memoir of faith, hope and loss”. More poignantly, it’s a memoir about the loss of faith and hope. The Pattersons were a churchgoing family, but Christina upped the stakes when she joined the youth club in search of a boy and found Jesus instead. In no time she was speaking in tongues and telling her diary that Monty Python’s Life of Brian was unforgivably blasphemous. “You’re beginning to sound like a fanatic,” her mother said, even before she went off to Perugia to convert Muslims. Later she turned down an exciting job in Arezzo because Bev, from the Christian leadership team, got word from God that Christina should do His work in Tooting instead. By then she had graduated from Durham, after Jesus (the Oxford college, that is) turned her down. She’d have liked a boyfriend but only one who also “knew the Lord”. At 26, she was still a virgin. Her faith might have endured but for her constant struggles with ill health. First it was her acne, which Roaccutane made worse. Then she was diagnosed with lupus. Then polyarthralgia, “which really just means an awful lot of pain”. At times she had to use a wheelchair. Therapy helped; reiki and acupuncture too. But then she’d be laid low again. Later came breast cancer and a spectacularly unpleasant surgeon. Fellow Christians told her that God was leading her through the wilderness for her own good. It’s a glorious moment in the narrative when she finally says, “Fuck off, God. Go and inflict your poisonous blows on somebody else.” It’s not only she who has been in pain. Her sister Caroline experiences delusions and spends time in a mental hospital with schizophrenia. She recovers but despite a sweet demeanour is never deemed well enough (in the eyes of insensitive employers) to hold down a job. Tom struggles too, quitting his job as an actuary for less stressful work as a gardener. His solace is wine and music. Caroline’s is an obsession with the Romanovs and, late on in her short life, a boyfriend. Christina, by comparison, is a success story: publicity assistant at Faber, director of the Poetry Society, editor and columnist at the Independent. She’s attractive, vibrant, funny, loves parties and has lots of good friends. Yet as a childless woman who’s often ill and who has never found the kind of love her parents did, she feels a failure. Don’t despair, you want to tell her, things will work out. But as she faces a mastectomy in the final 50 pages, you start to wonder if they ever will. The book journeys to dark places – Four Funerals and a Wedding might have been the title – but it’s too honest and well written to be dispiriting. Christina’s search to understand what happened to Caroline is especially moving – at one point she comes across the words Caroline had written in a page (later sticky-taped over) of an old diary: “Let Christina die this year of cancer.” That might have killed off any compassion she felt. But she perseveres in her quest to understand . Back in the days of their Jesus worship, a fellow zealot told Christina that God had laid a curse on the Patterson family. The story of the book is how she came to see what rubbish that was – that she wasn’t being punished for some nameless sin; that bad things can happen to good people; and that human love is what counts, not subservience to a sadist in the sky.
