3/1/2022,"MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia on Monday doubled down on the logic for sending its forces into Ukraine as it condemned a European Union decision to fund the delivery of weapons to Kyiv. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said at a news briefing that Western arms supplies to Ukraine showed that Moscow was right to try to demilitarise its neighbour. He said that many Russians were deeply pained by what was happening to their relatives in Ukraine, but blamed it on the actions of Ukrainian nationalists. ""The European Union is an association that is taking an unfriendly position towards us and taking measures that are not friendly, but hostile towards us,"" he told reporters. Weapons supplies to Ukraine would become ""an extremely dangerous and destabilizing factor"" that would not help restore stability but could in the long run have much more dangerous consequences, Peskov said. ""This, once again, confirms that Russia was right about the measures that are being taken in order to ensure the demilitarisation of the country,"" he said. The West has stepped up arms supplies to Ukraine to help it defend itself against the biggest invasion of a European state since World War Two. Moscow says it is engaged in a ""special military operation"" to protect civilians. Peskov said, without providing evidence, that many Ukrainians were being used as human shields in what he called a crime by Ukrainian nationalists. He described them as victims of their country's propaganda. ""Not only in the presidential administration, but throughout Russia, the vast majority of the population has friends or relatives who live in Ukraine. Naturally, everyone's hearts are aching for what is happening to these relatives,"" he said. He declined to comment on casualties suffered by Russian forces, referring the question to the defence ministry. He also declined to elaborate on President Vladimir Putin's instructions at the weekend for Russia's nuclear deterrence forces to be placed on a ""special regime"" of alertness, or to comment on whether there was a risk of confrontation between Russia and NATO.

3/1/2022,"Tucker Carlson is notorious for rewriting history, but he might have broken the record for the speed of this turnaround. The Fox News host whined to his millions of viewers on Monday that people are accusing him of rooting for Russia, days after he defended its president, Vladimir Putin, and leaned into Kremlin talking points ahead of its brutal invasion of Ukraine. He had argued Ukraine was “not a democracy” and delivered a lengthy rant last Tuesday questioning why he should be expected to hate the authoritarian leader. A clip of that monologue later aired on Russian state-sponsored TV with subtitles. But when Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) criticized Carlson’s rhetoric, noting that his comments served as televised material to rally Russians for Putin’s cause, Carlson was not happy. “It’s such an awful thing to say,” he griped after airing Swalwell’s remarks. “We hesitated to even play it.” He added: “It’s very common. You hear it every day. The question is: Why are they saying that? It doesn’t make sense.” Carlson’s critics did not have to look far back to offer him an explanation. Tucker Carlson just said ""it’s an awful thing"" that people are saying he supported Russia and wondered, ""Why are they saying it? It doesn’t make sense.""

3/1/2022,"By Andreas Rinke and Sarah Marsh BERLIN (Reuters) - The entire staff of former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's taxpayer-funded office have quit as the long-time friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin resists growing pressure to cut his ties to the Kremlin following its invasion of Ukraine. Schroeder, who took several jobs at Russian energy companies after leaving office in 2005, and other politicians from the ruling Social Democrats (SPD) have come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks for their lobbying for Russian firms. Such links have become a growing liability for Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who was long accused of being soft on Russia over the Ukraine crisis until his government last week did an about-face on various energy and defence policies. Over the weekend, SPD leaders urged Schroeder to give up his Russian posts as other former European politicians have, including France's former Prime Minister Francois Fillon. But Schroeder has resisted such pressure and, while he expressed rare criticism of Russia over its invasion in a statement last Thursday, he also said mistakes had been made ""on both sides"". Europe must ensure it does not cut its ties to Russia completely, he added. Staffer Albrecht Funk told Reuters that he, two secretaries and a driver had asked to be reassigned to other jobs in the chancellery, out of Schroeder's office. Funk declined to comment on the reason. Reuters was unable to reach Schroeder for comment. The chancellery did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Politicians of all stripes and Germany's taxpayers association have called in recent weeks for the state to stop funding the office Schroeder is legally due as a former chancellor. Putin piled lavish praise on Schroeder during Chancellor Scholz's visit to Moscow two weeks ago, saying it was thanks to him that Germans' gas bills were lower than elsewhere. ""He speaks only for himself, not the government,"" said Scholz. Critics say Germany's reliance on Russia for half its gas needs long constrained its ability or appetite to get tough with Russia. On Monday, the SPD premier of a northern state that set up a public foundation to help Gazprom complete the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany, despite U.S. sanctions, said it would be wound down.
