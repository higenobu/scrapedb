3/16/2022,"A couple in Pennsylvania were surprised at the legal trouble they found themselves in after they tried to spend the night inside of a Target to film a YouTube video. Johnson Larose and his girlfriend Charlotte Fischer co-run the YouTube channel called Saucy and Honey. The channel has more than 21,000 subscribers and features the couple doing viral challenges and pranking each other. See this bedroom turn into a vibrant oasis after an incredible one-day renovation: In one video that they posted on Feb. 21 titled “24 HOUR OVERNIGHT CHALLENGE IN TARGET (CAUGHT?!?),” Larose and Fischer filmed themselves walking into a Target 30 minutes before it closed and then hiding in order to stay at the store overnight. “Guys do not attempt what we are attempting at home. We are entertainers. We are risking trespassing. I don’t know what else can happen after that. If we get a fine or get arrested, I don’t really know. I don’t really care,” Fischer said in the video. Fischer added that they wouldn’t be stealing anything from Target and supplied their own water bottles and snacks, as well as wipes and mason jars, should they need to use the bathroom. The couple set up a fort out of product boxes on the bottom of a shelf until the store’s lights went off and then they wandered around the aisles filming themselves. Then, at 8 a.m. the next day, Larose and Fischer left Target. In addition to uploading a video that showed footage of them in the Target after hours, Fox 29 Philadelphia reported that officers were called to the store at 3 a.m. the night they slept over after an alarm went off. Police said they searched the building but did not find anyone. The next day, however, after learning about the alarm going off, Target employees watched security footage and saw a couple walking around the store after hours with their phones out — presumably Larose and Fischer. “It became a little bit bigger of an investigation, trying to find out what they were doing, was there something criminal?” police detective Scott Pezick said at the time. Security footage allegedly confirmed that Larose and Fischer did not take anything from the store. The footage also indicated that Larose and Fischer left through an emergency exit door at 3 a.m. — setting off the alarm — and then returned to the store at 8 a.m. to finish filming. Now both Larose and Fischer are facing charges of third-degree criminal trespassing and conspiracy and were released on a $25,000 unsecured bail. Third-degree trespassing is when someone unlawfully enters or remains in or upon a premise that isn’t theirs — even if it’s a public place like Target. For the time being, Larose and Fischer are not allowed to visit any Target stores in Pennsylvania and their next hearing is on March 24. “I mean, no regrets, just living life and having fun, it’s kind of sad that all of this came out of it, we were expecting a fine, nothing crazy,” Fischer said, according to Fox 29.

3/16/2022,"Emily Moloney felt good about her place in the Miami economy when the year began: She was earning $85,000 in a tech job and covering rent on a one-bedroom downtown apartment. Then came the notice of a $750 rent increase within 90 days. “I let them know this is basically an eviction,” Moloney, 31, said of the 40% hike needed to stay in her home. “I found Miami pretty affordable, until now.” Moloney was one of about 30 people who joined Miami’s latest rally to protest rent spikes and demand government action on a housing market that’s considered a crisis by affordability activists, elected leaders and others warning of rising prices endangering the workforce. A national ranking of rental costs from apartment-listing company Redfin found the greater Miami area, which includes Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, had the fifth highest rent increases last year in the country, up 31%. Are you a renter in Miami-Dade at risk of being evicted? Here’s what you need to know Data from Apartment List found the Miami area not quite as inflated as other metro areas, with a 27% rent increase landing the region at 11th on that ranking. Nelida Jean-Baptiste Pellot said she gave up on Miami last summer after losing her home to a fire. Making about $50,000 a year as a community organizer, the 36-year-old said finding a new place to live meant grim choices. “The places I could afford were scary: mold, rats, roaches,” she said. Now she’s living in Vero Beach. Poll: How are rising rents affecting you? Are you moving? Are you staying? The “Rent is Too Damn High” rally was organized by SMASH — an advocacy group formally named Struggle for Miami’s Affordable and Sustainable Housing. It was timed to coincide with Miami-Dade commissioners taking a vote on a new rule requiring 60-day notice for rent increases over 5%. The board also is considering legislation that could lead to a referendum on whether to freeze rents for a year — a proposal expected to come before the commission by the summer. The county’s mayor, Daniella Levine Cava, joined the event and said the current path of soaring rents was not sustainable. “I’m with you 100%,” she told participants. “We’re grateful for you stepping up and being the voice of the community for this crisis that cannot continue.” Daniella Pierre, 40, told the crowd that housing prices are driving out middle-class professionals such as teachers. She said there’s no option if she ever loses her spot in an affordable building. “I’ve looked all over the county,” said Pierre, president of the Miami-Dade NAACP. “I can’t go anywhere.” Moloney walked to the rally, where the crowd outside Miami-Dade’s Stephen P. Clark government center chanted “housing is a human right.” “I had to be here,” she said. One message she wanted to share was the possibility of tenants pushing back. While her landlord wanted a $750 increase, Moloney said she was able to negotiate a smaller rise of $250. “I’m not going to live above my means,” she said. “You have to know if your landlord is relying on your rent to survive, or if they’re price gouging. I knew they were price gouging.” Sofia Prado, 24, described herself as struggling on the lower end of Miami’s rental market, with a pipe leaking into the wall and a fridge that’s so cold it’s basically a freezer. She and a roommate share a 400-square-foot efficiency in Little Haiti, where a bunk bed allows for more space. Rent is $975 a month. A dog walker with a carpentry side job who is studying psychology at Miami Dade College, Prado previously lived in South Dade for the cheaper rent. But the commute ended up being too long to the Miami area, where she has school and work. Prado grew up in Miami, with parents from Nicaragua working in construction and housekeeping to pay bills. Now she is looking to leave Miami. “Life isn’t easy. I get it,” Prado said. “Honestly, if it wasn’t for school, I would have left already.”",U.S./Miami Herald,‘Basically an eviction.’ At Miami rent rally stories of $750 increase and grim choices,https://news.yahoo.com/basically-eviction-miami-rent-rally-182256988.html
3/16/2022,"A New York City woman is accused of kidnapping and torturing a man she met on Instagram for more than 12 hours while demanding a $100,000 ransom from his brother, authorities said on Tuesday. Valerie Rosario, 21, allegedly ""lured"" the unidentified victim, 24, to a Bronx apartment on Feb. 7, the New York City Police Department said. At least two men with firearms allegedly waited until he went inside and then entered the apartment after him. One of the men hit the victim with a pistol, according to a complaint provided by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. The suspects undressed the victim and put him in a bathtub, the complaint states. They then poured flammable liquid on him, burned him with a flame, and repeatedly stabbed him with a knife, it alleges. Around 2:40 p.m., the victim's brother said he received a FaceTime call and saw three masked individuals surrounding the victim, the complaint states. One of the suspects cut the victim while stating, “Give us $100,000 or we will kill him,"" according to the complaint. Police said the victim was later driven from the Bronx apartment to a location in Queens, where a detective saw one of the suspects in a van with a knife. The suspect, Javier Vargas, 24, of the Bronx, was arrested on Feb. 7 and charged with robbery, assault, kidnapping, and unlawful imprisonment. The victim was in the back of the van wrapped in a moving blanket with his nose and mouth covered with tape, police said. He was taken to the hospital in stable condition. Rosario and another suspect Michael Candelario, were both taken into custody on Wednesday and charged with attempted murder, robbery, assault, kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment.

3/16/2022,"WASHINGTON — Russian ground troops have made limited progress over the last 24 hours in their effort to seize major cities in Ukraine, a senior defense official said Tuesday. And as deadly airstrikes continue, the U.S. has seen indications that Russia may believe it needs more troops and supplies than it has on hand in the country, and is considering ways to get resources brought in, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. military assessments. The official did not elaborate on the indications, and said that as of Tuesday, however, there has been no actual movement of reinforcement troops currently in Russia going into Ukraine. According to the official, Russian ground forces are still about 15-20 kilometers (9-12 miles) northwest of Kyiv and 20-30 kilometers (12-19 miles) east of the city, which is being increasingly hit by long-range strikes. The official said Ukrainian troops continue to put up stiff resistance in Kharkiv and other areas. Russia has launched more than 950 missiles so far in the war, and both Russia and Ukraine still retain about 90% of their combat power, the official said. ___ Associated Press Writer Lolita Bandor contributed to this report. ___ HERE ARE TODAY'S KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: — U.S. President Joe Biden will travel to Europe next week for face-to-face talks with European leaders about Russia's invasion — Russia has stepped up its bombardment of Kyiv, as a series of strikes hit a residential neighborhood in the capital city — The European Union has imposed new sanctions, including measures that target Chelsea soccer club owner Roman Abramovich — The leaders of three European Union countries have traveled to Kyiv — Fox News says one of its video journalists was killed in Ukraine when the vehicle he was traveling in was struck by incoming fire Go to https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine for updates throughout the day. ___ HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING TODAY: MEDYKA, Poland — Refugees continued to pour into Poland on Tuesday at a border crossing connecting Ukraine to the Polish village of Medyka. Ludmila Deslichenko, 41, traveled from Cherkasy in central Ukraine. “We would like to go back home as soon as the war ends and when there’s peace,” Deslichenko said. “It was very terrifying. There were bombs during the day, also rockets, everywhere in Ukraine. There were a lot of explosions. As soon as it calms down and the war is over, we will go back.” Oksana Voloshen, 59, said she crossed the border to buy groceries to bring back to Mostyska in far western Ukraine. “We have nothing in the shops,” she said. Nicolas Kusiak, who leads NGOs and volunteers at the Medyka border crossing, said that while they’re seeing mostly refugees entering Poland, some are headed the other way. “We have a lot of military, ex-military from all over the world, the (United) States, U.K., Germany, Denmark, even Poland, joining the international legion,” Kusiak said. ___ KYIV, Ukraine — A senior aide to Ukraine’s president says that Russia has softened its stance in the talks over a possible settlement. Ihor Zhovkva, a deputy chief of staff to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Tuesday that the talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives have become “more constructive” and Russia has changed tone and stopped airing demands for Ukraine to surrender — something Russia had insisted upon during earlier stages of talks. Three rounds of talks in Belarus earlier this month have been followed by video calls between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, including the one on Tuesday. Zhovkva said that Ukrainian representatives feel “moderately optimistic” after the talks, adding that it would be necessary for Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to make major progress. ___ ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey’s foreign minister is traveling to Moscow as part of efforts to secure a cease-fire. Mevlut Cavusoglu would hold talks in Moscow on Wednesday before traveling to Ukraine for talks on Thursday, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday. In a televised address following a Cabinet meeting, Erdogan also said the Polish President Andrzej Duda would be visiting Turkey on Wednesday for talks expected to focus on the crisis. Last week the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers met on the sidelines of a diplomacy forum organized by Turkey, although their talks failed to produce a breakthrough. ___ BRATISLAVA, Slovakia — Slovakia’s Parliament has approved a NATO plan to deploy up to 2,100 troops on Slovak territory following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The plan is part of the NATO initiative to reassure member countries on the alliance’s eastern flank by sending forces to help protect them. Germany is supposed to contribute the biggest number of soldiers, up to 700, to the multinational battlegroup. The Czech Republic follows with 600 and the U.S. will send up to 400. The Netherlands, Poland and Slovenia will also contribute troops. Their deployment together with the Patriot air defense system will increase the defensive capabilities of Slovakia’s armed forces. The alliance stationed troops in the Baltic countries — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — and Poland after the 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula by Russia. After Russia attacked Ukraine, NATO decided to boost its presence along the entire eastern flank by deploying forces in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia. ___ MILAN — Italian museums said Tuesday that they had gotten a reprieve from a Russian request to immediately repatriate artworks on loan from the State Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg. The director of the State Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg said in a message relayed Monday by the Hermitage Italia collection that an agreement had been reached with Russian cultural officials so that “the paintings of Titian and Picasso can continue to remain on the walls of museums,” at Palazzo Reale in Milan and the Fondazione Alda Fendi in Rome. The same goes for works on loan to the Gallerie d’Italia, owned by bank Intesa Sanpaolo, in Milan. Russian cultural officials had requested the immediate repatriation of the works last week as cultural ties frayed along with the diplomatic tensions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Hermitage director general, Michail Piotrovsky, expressed regret “that cultural relations between our countries have collapsed into such ‘darkness.’ It can recover only if we conserve an atmosphere of good will and benevolence. We always repeat that the bridges of culture are the last to blow up. It is time to protect them.” ___ BRUSSELS — NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says he’s convened a summit for next week of the military organization’s 30 leaders to discuss Russia’s war on Ukraine. Stoltenberg says the March 24 summit will be led by U.S. President Joe Biden and “will address the consequences of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, our strong support for Ukraine, and further strengthening NATO’s deterrence and defense in response to a new reality for our security.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed that Biden will travel to Brussels for the face-to-face talks with European leaders. The trip follows on Vice President Kamala Harris’ visit to eastern flank NATO countries of Poland and Romania last week to discuss with leaders the growing refugee crisis in eastern Europe sparked by the Russian invasion and to underscore the Biden administration’s support for NATO allies. Stoltenberg said in a statement Tuesday that “at this critical time, North America and Europe must continue to stand together in NATO.” NATO has been bolstering its eastern flank with troops and equipment to deter Russia from invading any of its members. NATO refuses to deploy troops to Ukraine as it is concerned about sparking a wider war in Europe. ___ An employee of Russian state television who interrupted a live news program by protesting the war in Ukraine was ordered to pay a fine by a Russian court Tuesday. Marina Ovsyannikova, an employee of the Russian Channel 1, walked into the studio during Monday’s evening news show with a poster saying “no war” and “Russians against the war.” In a video recorded before her action, Ovsyannikova said that her father is Ukrainian and her mother Russian. She urged Russians to join anti-war protests and said that “Russia is the aggressor country and one person, Vlaidmir Putin, solely bears responsibility for that aggression.” Ovsyannikova spent the night in police custody, and Moscow’s Ostankino District Court on Tuesday ordered Ovsyannikova to pay a fine of 30,000 rubles (about $270) on charges of organizing unsanctioned actions for her call to take part in demonstrations against the war. ___ BRUSSELS — The European Union has slapped sanctions on Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich as part of a new package of measures targeting Russia. The EU included the Russian oligarch in its updated list of individuals facing assets freeze and travel bans over their role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The 55-year-old Abramovich had already been punished in Britain by Boris Johnson’s administration last week. The aluminum magnate was among seven wealthy Russians who had their assets frozen under British sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich has also been suspended as director of the Premier League club. The EU said Abramovich “has had privileged access to the president, and has maintained very good relations with him. This connection with the Russian leader helped him to maintain his considerable wealth.” ___ The Russian Foreign Ministry says Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly, Defense Minister Anita Anand and other Canadian officials have been put on a sanctions list. The ministry said in Tuesday’s statement that they have been barred from entering Russia in retaliation to Canadian sanctions against the Russian leadership. The Russian sanctions also targeted Canadian lawmakers. The ministry said the decision was a forced move taken in response to “hostile actions by the current Canadian regime that has long tested our patience.” The decision followed the announcement of Russian sanctions against U.S. President Joe Biden and senior members of his administration. ___ The Russian Foreign Ministry says Moscow is withdrawing from the Council of Europe. The ministry said it handed a formal notice about Russia’s decision to leave the continent’s leading human rights organization to the Council of Europe’s Secretary General Marija Pejčinović Burić on Tuesday. It said the move followed the Council of Europe’s decision to suspend Russia’s membership that was taken on Feb. 25. The ministry charged that the Council of Europe has become an instrument of exerting pressure on Russia and alleged that it has been heavily influenced by NATO and the European Union. It said in a statement that its withdrawal from the Council of Europe wouldn’t impact human rights and freedoms in the country, which officials said are safeguarded by the Russian constitution. Russia’s invasion has sparked widespread allegations of war crimes, as hundreds of Ukrainian civilians have been killed and numerous residential areas have been targeted by Russian troops. ____ The Kremlin says that President Vladimir Putin has discussed the situation in Ukraine with European Council President Charles Michel. The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin informed Michel about the Russian view of the talks with Ukraine in Tuesday’s call, adding that Ukrainian officials haven’t yet “demonstrated a serious intention to search for mutually acceptable solutions.” Michel said on Twitter that he told Putin about the “urgent need to stop Russia’s fratricidal war against Ukraine” and emphasized that “indiscriminate shelling by Russian forces of Ukraine civilians must stop.” He added that “Russia must urgently enable humanitarian access and safe passage. ___ WARSAW — During a news conference with foreign journalists on Monday in Warsaw, Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski said that while solidarity for Ukrainian refugees remains strong, steps must be taken to avoid a backlash. More than 1.8 million refugees have fled to Poland. Around 390,000 people have traveled to Warsaw, where 300,000 displaced Ukrainians remain. Warsaw has become a major transfer point for Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion. Its central train station has become a hub for people awaiting transport further West. “I need to take care of the normal functioning of the city, because the more problems we have, the more our attention is diverted to other issues for longer, then we will start having problems in schools and hospitals and elsewhere,” he told reporters. ___ BELGRADE, Serbia — Another flight from Belgrade to Moscow has received a bomb threat that turned out to be false, Serbia’s police said Tuesday. Unlike two other threats since Friday, this time it came before the plane took off. On Friday and Monday, the aircraft had to turn back shortly after takeoff for inspection. The police said Tuesday they are investigating the third false claim in five days. Serbian state media say the threatening emails came from Ukraine. Besides Turkish carriers, Serbia’s national airline AirSerbia is the only airline in Europe still flying to and from Russia. Serbia, which formally seeks European Union membership but has maintained close relations with ally Russia, has refused to join an international flight ban against Moscow in response to the war in Ukraine. ___ UNITED NATIONS — Russia has circulated a proposed U.N. Security Council resolution demanding protection for civilians “in vulnerable situations” in Ukraine and safe passage for humanitarian aid and people seeking to leave the country — but it makes no mention of Russia’s responsibility for the war against its smaller neighbor. The draft resolution released Tuesday expresses “grave concern” at the deteriorating humanitarian situation and reports of civilian casualties in and around Ukraine. It endorses U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ call for dialogue and negotiations and calls for a negotiated cease-fire to rapidly evacuate “all civilians,” and underscores “the need for the parties concerned to agree on humanitarian pauses to this end.” The draft, which never identifies “the parties concerned,” could be put to a vote as early as Wednesday, according to a Russian diplomat who was not authorized to speak publicly because discussions have been private. The Russian measure was circulated a day after France and Mexico announced that a humanitarian resolution on Ukraine they co-sponsored, which had been discussed for two weeks in the Security Council, was being moved to the 193-member General Assembly for discussion and a vote. That draft resolution called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and deplored the dire humanitarian consequences of the hostilities in Ukraine, provisions which are not in the proposed Russian resolution. The France-Mexico resolution would almost certainly have led to a Russian veto in the Security Council, but there are no vetoes in the General Assembly. Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters that his country is prepared to support a humanitarian resolution and after Monday’s announcement by the French and Mexican ambassadors Russia thinks “the chances are still there,” so he was putting forward its “roadmap” and will see whether the council adopts it. ___ Associated Press Writer Edith Lederer contributed to this report. ___ TORONTO — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked Canadians to imagine bombs landing in their communities as he told the Canadian Parliament that his people want to live. Zelenskyy urged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Canadian lawmakers to help enact a no-fly zone over the Ukraine and called for greater economic pressure on Russia. “Justin, can you imagine you and your children hearing all these severe explosions, the bombing of the airport, the bombing of the Ottawa airport,” Zelenskyy said. “Cruise missiles are falling down and your children are asking you, ‘What happened?’” Speaking by video from Ukraine to a packed Canadian House of Commons chamber, Zelenskyy said the Russian war is designed to annihilate Ukraine and subjugate its people. Zelenskyy evoked British wartime leader Winston Churchill as he told the U.K. Parliament last week that his country would fight Russia’s invasion to the end. Zelenskyy will also speak Wednesday to members of the U.S. House and Senate, an event that will be livestreamed for the public. ___ MYKOLAIV, Ukraine — In Mykolaiv, a southern Ukraine city bordering the Black Sea, walls of sandbags with mannequins for decoys are placed at checkpoints. A high sandbag wall protects the front of a building serving as a support center for the military. Rodyin Lavrushin is a volunteer at the center. He lifted a tarp covering plastic crates filled with Molotov cocktails. “Here we collect everything from food to clothes and military specifics and help our military because the Russian occupiers came here to our home and we will protect it to the end.” Lavrushin said Monday. Mykolaiv resident Svetlana Gryshchenko said her son was killed Feb. 26 in the Donetsk region. “He went there to the military command,” Gryshchenko said. “He was a soldier and he’d just turned 24. He went there to work (with the military), not to fight.” “What is happening now in Mykolaiv cannot be described through words,” Gryshchenko said. “We are bombed during the day and during the night. We are peaceful citizens, and I cannot put it into words. It is impossible to put into words. It’s a nightmare what Russia is doing on the territory of Ukraine.” Outside the Mykolaiv city morgue, bodies placed in plastic bags lie on the ground because the building had no room for more of the dead. ___ NEW YORK — Fox News says one of its video journalists was killed in Ukraine when the vehicle he was traveling in was struck by incoming fire. The network said Tuesday that videographer Pierre Zakrzewski was killed in an incident that also injured reporter Benjamin Hall, who remains hospitalized. Their injuries occurred Monday in Horenka, outside of Kyiv. Zakrzewski was a veteran journalists who had covered conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria for Fox. Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media, said in a memo to staff members on Tuesday that “his passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched.” He won an internal award at Fox for helping to get freelancers and their families out of Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal last year. He was the second journalist killed in Ukraine in two days, following the death of documentary filmmaker Brent Renaud. ___ BRUSSELS — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says the 30-nation military alliance is set to radically change its security posture in Europe in the future in response to Russia’s war on Ukraine. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and its military integration with Belarus, create a new security reality on the European continent,” Stoltenberg said Tuesday, on the eve of a meeting of NATO defense ministers. “We need to reset our military posture for this new reality,” he told reporters. Stoltenberg said the ministers, led by U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, would discuss possible changes on Wednesday. “On land, this could include substantially more forces in the eastern part of the alliance, at higher readiness, and with more prepositioned equipment,” Stoltenberg said. In recent years, NATO has deployed a relatively small force of around 5,000 troops to the Baltic countries – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – and Poland on a rotating basis to deter Russia from invading. Stoltenberg says he expects the ministers will task NATO military commanders to come up with options for boosting security in eastern Europe for the alliance’s leaders to choose among at their June summit. ___ NEW YORK — Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin says the country aims to spend around 1 trillion rubles ($9 billion) on measures to support an economy hit by international sanctions. Mishustin said the government would work with other ex-Soviet countries to reshape their trade relationships with a focus on helping Russia to get the imports it needs. Mishustin said the measures aim to “ensure the maximum flexibility for the economy, remove internal restrictions on business and give more freedom to entrepreneurs.” Russia’s economy has been disrupted after foreign companies in a wide range of industries suspended their operations in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. The government’s responses so far have included programs to support lending to businesses, suspending some regulatory processes and restricting exports of grain and sugar. ___ VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis is praying for the people of Kyiv as Russia steps up its bombardment of the Ukrainian capital. The Vatican said Tuesday that Francis had received a letter from the Kyiv mayor, inviting him to visit the city as a messenger of peace. The Vatican didn’t say if Francis had responded or was considering a visit. Such a trip would be highly unlikely given security concerns, Francis’ efforts to maintain relations with the Russian Orthodox Church and the Vatican’s tradition of quiet, behind-the-scenes diplomacy. In a statement responding to the Kyiv city invitation, Holy See spokesperson Matteo Bruni said Francis was spiritually close “to the suffering of the city, its people, to those who were forced to flee and those who are called to run it. He prays to the Lord that they are protected from violence.” The March 8 letter invited Francis to visit Kyiv or to participate in a virtual conference of religious leaders. “We appeal to you, as a spiritual leader, to show your compassion, to stand with the Ukrainian people by jointly spreading the call for peace,” the letter read. ___ BRUSSELS — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is concerned that Russia might be trying to create a pretext to use chemical weapons in Ukraine. Stoltenberg said Tuesday that Russia’s “absurd claims” about biological labs and chemical weapons in Ukraine are “an absolute lie.” “This is just another lie. And we are concerned that Moscow could stage a false flag operation, possibly including chemical weapons,” he told reporters in Brussels. Stoltenberg says that any use of chemical weapons by Russia would be a violation of international law but he refused to say whether it would be a red line that might draw a military response from NATO.",World/Associated Press,Live updates: US believes Russia may need reinforcements,https://news.yahoo.com/live-updates-russian-strikes-hit-060359899.html
3/16/2022,"WASHINGTON — A lack of new congressional funding could imperil the nation’s ability to respond to future coronavirus waves, the White House warned on Tuesday, even as prospects for passage of its $15.6 billion pandemic-response request appeared to be slim. “We need this money,” a senior administration official told reporters during a press call on Tuesday, pointing to looming shortfalls in the ability to manufacture and widely distribute tests, therapeutics and vaccines. “Time is not on our side. We need this funding immediately.” In an accompanying memorandum, the White House said that without new funding, it may not be able to stockpile additional vaccine booster doses and would have to cut back its purchase of monoclonal antibody treatments by 30%. Reimbursements for testing people without health insurance will end within a matter of weeks, potentially depriving Americans of pandemic-related health care. And without new funding, efforts to develop and distribute new vaccines would also be imperiled. “Inaction will set us back in this fight, leave us less prepared, and cost us more lives,” the White House memo said. The Biden administration had initially requested $30 billion, only to revise the request down to $22.5 billion and, finally, to $15.6 billion. But even with the amount halved, the funding failed to pass when Congress voted to provide $1.5 trillion in government funding through September. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the failure “heartbreaking,” blaming Senate Republicans, who insisted that the new coronavirus spending come from funds already appropriated to states — a measure that some Democrats refused to support because it would have come from states they represented. The stalemate comes as cases of a new Omicron subvariant, known as BA.2, are on the rise in some countries, fueling fears of a new surge. Although reported cases are still falling in the United States, between Feb. 27 and March 13 more than one-third of the sewage sampling sites monitored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed an increase in coronavirus rates. Experts also say it is just a matter of time until the virus evolves once more to become more transmissible or virulent — or both. “It is a very smart virus,” Pfizer chief executive Alberto Bourla told Yahoo Finance earlier this week. “And the scenario that will come with another variant that maybe is more transmissible or maybe creates more severe disease I think is a scenario that exists. It's a likely scenario.” The White House will now push to pass the $15.6 billion in coronavirus funds as a standalone measure unattached to a big spending bill. Politico reported on Tuesday that the administration was looking for ways to pay the new round of funding without alienating the fragile coalition that a bitterly divided Congress requires. “We need funding now,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday, “so we’re prepared for whatever comes.”",Politics/Yahoo News,White House pleads for new coronavirus funds: 'We need this money',https://news.yahoo.com/white-house-pleads-for-new-coronavirus-funds-we-need-this-money-174218546.html
