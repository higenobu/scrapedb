5/17/2022,"It was grimly poignant that the first Black person to hold a briefing as White House press secretary should begin by naming victims of white supremacist violence. Karine Jean-Pierre, standing at the famed blue lectern, took a moment to “remember lives lost and forever changed in Buffalo” with brief and evocative biographies of the 10 victims of Saturday’s mass shooting in New York state. Evidently, whereas Joe Biden’s first press secretary, Jen Psaki, could ride a wave of optimism at the start of a new administration – and benefit by comparison to Donald Trump’s mendacious messengers – Jean-Pierre is inheriting a world of trouble. Her 64-minute debut on Monday ranged from Buffalo to baby formula, from Somalia to Ukraine, but first she used her opening remarks to reflect on the new chapter of White House history she was writing. “I am a Black, gay, immigrant woman,” said Jean-Pierre, born in Martinique to Haitian parents and raised in New York. “The first of all three of those to hold this position. I would not be here today if it were not for generations of barrier-breaking people before me. I stand on their shoulders.” Expressing gratitude to the sacrifices those who came before her, the 47-year-old added: “Representation does matter. You hear us say this often in this administration, and no one understands this better than President Biden.” Biden, she would go on to remind the briefing more than once, had been motivated to run for president by white nationalists clashing with civil rights activists in Charlottesville, Virginia, nearly five years ago. And it surely did mean something that, whereas Trump had told the media there were very fine people on both sides, and had been defended by a white press secretary, Sarah Sanders, here was a Black press secretary insisting that hate will have no safe harbour. Composed and genial, Jean-Pierre was successful in observing the first rule of media briefings – do no harm – but did appear a little too cautious on one point. She was repeatedly asked if she would “call out” individuals such as Fox News host Tucker Carlson or Republican members of Congress who fan the flames of extremism and the “great replacement” theory. Time and again she refused. “It doesn’t matter who it is,” she insisted. “If a person espouses hatred, we need to call that out. I’m not going to get a back and forth on names and who said what.” One reporter asked if Biden sees a connection to Trump’s “ultra-Maga” movement. Again she dodged. When the press secretary said, “We’re not going to get into politics here,” another journalist loudly objected that this seemed to be letting the culprits off the hook. Jean-Pierre protested that Biden had always condemned hate: “Once you get into calling out people’s names then you move away from that issue.” Critics will say the Biden administration is pulling its punches. How can the scourge of white supremacy, which the president describes as a stain on the soul of America, be addressed if he will not identify its tribunes? Is Biden, once again, living in a sepia-tinted age of bipartisanship? Jean-Pierre’s reticence was thrown into sharp relief down Pennsylvania Avenue where Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, did name names. “In a craven quest for viewers and ratings, organisations such as Fox News have spent years perfecting the craft of stoking cultural grievance and political resentment that eerily mirrors the messages found in replacement theory. “According to one measure by the New York Times, Fox’s top political pundit – most widely watched – Tucker Carlson, has spewed rhetoric that echoes replacement theory at least 400 times on his show since 2016.” The contrast was illustrative: the job of White House press secretary is often about ducking controversies and not making headlines. Psaki was masterful at promising to “circle back” and “not get ahead of the president”. Now, like the TV time traveller Doctor Who, the press secretary has regenerated in different and diverse form but with essentially the same character. Devoted Psaki fans might gripe that Jean-Pierre, who entered 38 minutes late with a smile and a briefing book under her arm, has not yet got the knack of riffing spontaneously. For example, Psaki’s tussles with Peter Doocy of Fox News would sometimes go viral when she delivered an off-the cuff “#Psakibomb”. When Doocy challenged Jean-Pierre on Monday, she did not seem quite so nimble. He noted that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos had criticised Biden for a tweet the president wrote suggesting that taxing wealthier corporations could help bring down inflation. Jean-Pierre read from her notes: “Look, it’s not a huge mystery why one of the wealthiest individuals on Earth, right, opposes an economic agenda that is for the middle class, that cuts some of the biggest costs families face, fights inflation for the long haul, right …” It went on in wonky fashion. But Monday will be remembered as the day that Jean-Pierre shattered multiple glass ceilings. Asked to reflect on her history making role, she said she had not read many of the things written about her. “But there was something that moved me,” she said, referring to a media story about her elementary school in Hempstead, New York. “They talked to the students about me and this moment and this administration … and these kids wrote me a letter and, in the letter, they talked about how they can dream bigger because of me standing behind this podium. And that matters.”",News/US news,"White House’s first Black press secretary makes history, but inherits a world of trouble",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/karine-jean-pierre-biden-administration
5/17/2022,"Scott Morrison’s Aukus middleman has not lobbied any US officials since the landmark security deal was announced, despite a previous agreement with the prime minister “to engage with US personnel to facilitate Australia’s engagement with US and UK per Aukus agreement”, according to a newly filed document. Prof Donald Winter, a former US navy secretary, was serving as the prime minister’s special adviser on naval shipbuilding when the deal to enable Australia to access America’s nuclear-propelled submarine technology was revealed. A new filing to the US foreign lobbying register shows that, since the Aukus announcement, Winter has received about $62,560 from Australia’s Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) for “Consultations re shipbuilding”. These were in six payments between October 2021 and March 2022. But Winter’s filing states that he has not carried out any “representational activities” during that time. That is despite Winter saying in a previous filing in September 2021 that Morrison had asked him to engage with senior US personnel, especially the navy, “to further Aukus implementation”. At the time, PM&C told Guardian Australia: “As a trusted adviser to the prime minister and a former United States secretary of the navy, Prof Winter is uniquely placed to engage within the US system on behalf of Australia in the implementation of the Aukus partnership.” In a new filing stamped 19 April, Winter says his activities in the six months to the end of March could all be described as “consultations regarding Australia’s naval shipbuilding program”, with no representations made. The filings to the US Department of Justice are required under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (Fara), the US equivalent of Australia’s foreign influence register. The form suggests Winter’s connection with “Prime minister of Australia” ended on 13 October 2021. But the meaning of this change is unclear, because the same form indicates he continued to provide advisory services after this date via PM&C. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning When contacted for comment on the new filing, a spokesperson for PM&C said Winter’s Fara registration “ensures that his engagements are compliant with US legislation”. “Prof Winter has been engaged to provide expert specialist advice to the prime minister on the national naval shipbuilding enterprise,” the spokesperson said. “Prof Winter, in his advisory role, engages with Australian officials in person and virtually across the breadth of the naval shipbuilding work in Defence. This includes both surface and submarine aspects.” PM&C did not answer a direct question about why Winter had not made any representations despite the department’s previous statement and the earlier Fara filing. It did not answer on whether the nature of the arrangement had changed in the meantime. Guardian Australia contacted the US National Academy of Engineering, which Winter chairs, to give him the opportunity to comment. The prime minister’s office, as distinct from the department, was also contacted for a response. The first filing, submitted under Fara on 24 September, suggested the new understanding between Winter and Morrison was not based on a formal written contract nor an exchange of correspondence. Instead, Winter wrote, Morrison had requested broader assistance on 23 September during the prime minister’s visit to the US. “Request to engage with US personnel to facilitate Australia’s engagement with US and UK per Aukus agreement,” Winter wrote at the time, in a filing that was first publicised on Twitter by the citizen journalist Jommy Tee.

Request received during PM’s visit to DC. Activities intended to support 18-month study phase per Aukus agreement.” The earlier filing showed he would receive compensation of US$6,000 (A$8,600) a day plus expenses. In the election campaign, Morrison has promoted Aukus as “the most significant defence security agreement Australia has entered into in over 70 years”. But he has been forced to defend his handling of the matter after the Nine newspapers reported that the US had made it clear in negotiations that it wanted enduring bipartisan backing for the deal, given that it would be a decades-long endeavour. Joe Biden’s Indo-Pacific coordinator, Kurt Campbell, told the newspapers that he and the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, had asked “lots of questions about politics” during a crucial meeting with the Australian intelligence chief Andrew Shearer on 1 May last year. Those questions included: “Would this be contentious? Would this hold?” The Australian government reportedly assured the Americans that Labor would be supportive of the deal, based on an assessment of the political dynamics. But Labor has cried foul, saying it should have been brought into the tent earlier. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, and senior frontbenchers were finally briefed the day before the early-morning announcement in mid-September. Albanese said on Monday Labor “could not have been more clear, more decisive, or more certain about our support for Aukus” but the prime minister “continued to play politics”. But Morrison said he wasn’t going to risk sharing the details with Labor until the deal was finalised, and noted that ultimately it had secured bipartisan support. “This was a process that, for 18 months, painstakingly working through incredible detail, incredibly sensitive issues, highly confidential,” Morrison said. “This wasn’t something I was going to be loose with.” Guardian Australia has previously revealed the head of the Department of Home Affairs, Michael Pezzullo, was kept out of the loop and the government wanted an earlier preliminary investigation into nuclear-powered submarines to be handled on a “strictly need-to-know basis”. Australia is now conducting an 18-month study with the US and the UK to find the best way to build at least eight nuclear-powered submarines – a capability the government says is needed because of concerns about China’s strategic intentions. The cost of scrapping the previous deal for French conventional submarines remains subject to negotiations that are unlikely to be concluded before the election.",News/World news,"Scott Morrison’s Aukus middleman has not lobbied US officials since landmark deal announced, document shows",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/scott-morrisons-aukus-middleman-has-not-lobbied-us-officials-since-landmark-deal-announced-document-shows
