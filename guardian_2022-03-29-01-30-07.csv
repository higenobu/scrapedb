3/29/2022,"The UK appears set to criminalise illicit refugee crossings and could ship asylum seekers for processing in other countries after ministers easily saw off a potential rebellion in the Commons over the controversial borders and nationality bill. Despite a number of Conservative backbenchers expressing concerns about aspects of the bill, the government convincingly won a string of votes to restore elements changed in the House of Lords, including the idea of Australian-style third country processing. Speaking in the debate, Tom Pursglove, the junior migration minister, confirmed that, as restored, the bill could see Ukrainian refugees who arrived without permission removed for processing. He added there was “absolutely no reason” for Ukrainian nationals to resort to illicit crossings. He said the powers to prosecute and jail people who arrive by unofficial means, such as on a small boat across the Channel, would only be used in “egregious cases”, such as someone entering the country in breach of a deportation order. Tory rebels did claim a slight victory after Pursglove agreed to meet them to discuss ideas to allow all asylum seekers to more easily access work, as is already the case for those from Ukraine and Afghanistan. This was welcomed by Robert Buckland, the former lord chancellor, who was among more than 60 Tory MPs and peers who signed a letter backing a change, saying he hoped to reach “a mutually agreeable solution” with the government over the issue. There was, however, barely any open revolt against the government. Only two Conservatives, Simon Hoare and Tim Loughton, voted to keep the Lords amendment on rules over work, while three voted against overseas processing – Loughton again, and former ministers Andrew Mitchell and David Davis. In all, seven Lords amendments were put to the vote, with other areas including family reunions and targeting illicit entry to the UK, and all were overturned by significant majorities, the lowest being 59. The bill will now be reconsidered by the Lords, possibly at the end of this month. The government has argued its approach is necessary to stop people making dangerous Channel boat trips with people smugglers. But responding for Labour, the shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the system would be “neither fair, compassionate nor orderly”. Mitchell and Davis both castigated the plan for overseas processing, with the former saying that if the costs were similar to those seen by Australia, rather than sending asylum seekers abroad “it would be much cheaper to put each one in the Ritz, and send all the under-18s to Eton”. Davis said the approach amounted to offering poorer countries “a spectacular bribe to take in our dirty washing”. Citing the numerous reports of assaults and self-harm in Australian camps, he said: “That’s what we appear to be trying to copy here.” The former de facto deputy prime minister, Damian Green, warned that the plan would do little to ease the boat landings as there were no legitimate routes available for the nationalities most involved, such as people from Iran, Iraq and Yemen. “Those routes need to be available, and for far too many people they are not available under the current system,” Green said. Tim Farron, the former Liberal Democrat leader, gave a passionate speech calling the bill “a traffickers’ charter”. He said: “You vote for this bill, you are voting for deaths in the Channel. You remove the right for anyone who is not Ukrainian, Afghan or Syrian to have a safe route here. That is an outrage, and members opposite know that is the truth.”",News/World news,UK set to criminalise illicit refugee crossings after ministers avoid Commons rebellion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/uk-set-to-criminalise-illicit-refugee-crossings-after-commons-rebellion-averted

3/29/2022,"Donald Trump’s lawyer John Eastman must turn over to the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack around a hundred emails he had refused to submit to the investigation, a federal judge ruled Monday, also saying Donald Trump “more likely than not” committed felonies over the January 6 insurrection. The extraordinary ruling that paves the way for the select committee to obtain some of Eastman’s most sensitive emails concerning his illegal scheme to return Trump to office marks another major breakthrough for the investigation. “Based on the evidence the court finds that it is more likely than not that president Trump and Dr Eastman dishonestly conspired to obstruct the joint session of congress on Jan 6, 2021,” ruled judge David Carter. Among the emails that the judge ordered Eastman to turn over include messages forwarded to him by Trump’s attorney, Rudy Giuliani, recommending that Mike Pence, then vice-president, overturn the 2020 election and laid out a day-by-day plan of action leading up to January 6.

3/29/2022,"It is not often an actor experiences both the high point and the low point of their careers on the same night, but you can always trust Will Smith to push the boundaries of movie stardom. His win as best actor ought to have been the cherry on top of one of the most successful film careers in history – except Smith himself had already sabotaged the moment, the night, and possibly his future when he got up on stage 40 minutes earlier and slapped Chris Rock for an inappropriate joke about his wife. Smith could spend the rest of his life looking back on Sunday night as the best of times and the worst, but which one will prevail? Is Smith big enough to survive such a jarring incident – or is the Fresh Prince past his sell-by date? The unique nature of both the incident and the actor have us grasping for precedent. In 2017, Casey Affleck went through the similarly awkward motions of accepting best actor Oscar, for Manchester By the Sea, even as allegations of earlier sexual harassment resurfaced, turning what should have been a huge career bounce into a damaging trial by public opinion. Affleck denied the accusation but his reputation has never really recovered. He’s a rising character actor, though. Will Smith is in a different league, arguably one of his own. Richard Williams, the character Smith played in King Richard, drew up an 85-page plan for how to turn his daughters Venus and Serena into tennis champs. It worked. Similarly, in the early 1990s, Smith drew up a plan to become the biggest movie star in the world, analysing box-office numbers and movie formulas. That worked too. He has ruled Hollywood for over 30 years, his films grossing over $9 billion at the box office, and he has an estimated net worth of at least $350 million. He is one of the few actors whose name can open a movie and usually guarantee a $100m box office (King Richard has performed far below that, but then it was released simultaneously on HBO Max). Smith’s projects in the pipeline include slavery thriller Emancipation, for which Apple paid $120m for the rights, a sequel to the Netflix sci-fi Bright, a travel series with National Geographic and Bad Boys 4. Is Smith simply too big to fail? “I don’t think anybody’s too big to fail,” says film publicist Charles McDonald. “Not in this day and age.” In recent years, entertainment figures once considered unassailable have been swiftly dethroned, McDonald points out, not least by the #MeToo movement. Harvey Weinstein was, after all, considered a fixture of the movie industry. “I don’t think it’s a question of size,” says McDonald. “I think it’s just a question of who you are, what your position is, and how you’re thought of. I think probably Will Smith can surface – if he does the right thing, in the right time.” There is a crisis-management protocol to situations like this, says Bumble Ward, another seasoned film publicist. “The steps are always the same. You have to show proper contrition. You have to apologise to those you’ve hurt. And then you have to behave in such a way that people don’t believe it’s going to happen again. But it has to be a proper apology. I think he did a lot of that work in his speech.” During the commercial break between the actor slapping Rock and his acceptance speech, Smith’s publicist Meredith O Sullivan was spotted in discussion with Smith at his table, as was Denzel Washington. When he went up to collect his award, Smith clearly did not give the speech he’d originally planned. He cited Richard Williams as “a fierce defender of his family”. He relayed Washington’s advice to him moments earlier: “At your highest moment, be careful – that’s when the devil comes for you.” And he professed that “love will make you do crazy things”. He also apologised to the Academy and to his fellow nominees but, pointedly, not to Rock himself. Another industry insider, who did not wish to be named, predicted that Smith would be making a public apology to Rock pretty soon. Rock would likely reciprocate and apologise to Jada Pinkett Smith. The event would then be swept under the red carpet as quickly as possible. That process was already under way on Sunday night. Host Amy Schumer made light of the event, saying: “Did I miss anything? There’s, like, a different vibe in here.” Presenting best actress, Anthony Hopkins also seemed ready to move on. “Will Smith said it all,” he said, to nervous laughter from the audience. “What more can be said? Let’s have peace and love and quiet.” But there is quite a lot more to be said. This crisis is by no means over. The Smith brand has not looked entirely rock-solid in recent years. In fact, it has been in recovery mode. His 2016 movie Collateral Beauty, an excruciating self-help tearjerker, was the biggest flop of his career. More damaging still was 2013’s After Earth, a self-funded sci-fi movie designed to showcase the talents of the entire Smith clan: Will and Jada co-produced, Will co-wrote, and reportedly co-directed, with M Night Shyamalan. He also co-starred alongside his son, Jaden, who was parachuted into the lead role. Sometimes it felt less like a film and more like an exposure of the Smith family’s weaknesses and weirdnesses, compounded by a series of bizarre interviews (the Smith children’s contemptuous comments about traditional schools made them seem out of touch) along with revelations about the Smith parents’ not-so-private life. In 2020, Will and Jada opted to air their relationship issues in public on Jada’s talk show Red Table Talk, where she spoke of their separation and her “entanglement” with another man – rapper August Alsina – as Smith nodded along. At the same time, there has always been a messianic aspect to Smith’s public persona. He has self-belief and bravado in droves, from his rap career to his portrayal of Muhammad Ali in 2002, which earned him his first Oscar nomination. As last year’s memoir Will laid out, Smith has been on something of a journey lately, re-examining his childhood and his father’s abuse of his mother, but also going on ayahuasca trips in the Amazon. Smith evidently believes in his own sense of purpose, as he made clear in his Oscars speech. “In this time in my life, in this moment,” he said, “I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world. I’m being called on in my life to love people, and to protect people, and to be a river to my people.” Who is actually calling upon Smith to fill this role, and is he living up to it? That is open to question. The public might easily find such pronouncements off-putting. Showbiz careers live and die by public opinion. Some are wondering if Smith’s career might now be at a tipping point. Others expect this to blow over. “I think he can survive,” says McDonald. “I think people have a great affection for him. You can’t resort to violence like that, obviously, and the language he used afterwards, despite the provocation. But I think there will be sympathy for him.” Other Oscar-winners on the night might not be feeling much sympathy for Smith right now, given that his actions effectively drowned out their moments of glory. As for Smith’s own achievements, he might well have cancelled out what should have been the greatest night of his life.",Arts/Film,Will Smith and the $9 billion question: can his career survive – or is the Fresh Prince finished?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/oscars-and-slap-can-will-smith-career-survive-or-is-the-fresh-prince-finished
3/29/2022,"Cadbury has slashed the size of its family-size bars of Dairy Milk by 10% as the nation’s favourite chocolate falls prey to “shrinkflation”. The confectionery company has announced it is passing on rapidly rising production costs to customers, with US-based parent company Mondelez blaming inflation. The reduction in weight, from 200g to 180g, comes as the UK faces the worst cost-of-living crisis in 30 years. With inflation soaring to 6.2% last month, Cadbury is the latest company to shrink a product’s size while maintaining the same price in order to offset rising costs. Mondelez said this was the first time in a decade that they had shrunk a Dairy Milk. In 2012, a 49g bar was reduced to 45g but the price remained 59p, while the 140g chocolate bar was reduced in size to 120g a year earlier. “We’re facing the same challenges that so many other food companies have already reported when it comes to significantly increased production costs – whether it’s ingredients, energy or packaging – and rising inflation,” a Mondelez spokesperson said. “We understand that consumers are faced with rising costs too, which is why we look to absorb costs wherever we can, but, in this difficult environment, we’ve had to make the decision to slightly reduce the weight of our medium Cadbury Dairy Milk bars for the first time since 2012, so that we can keep them competitive and ensure the great taste and quality our fans enjoy.” It 2015, to much dismay, Cadbury announced a reduction in its Creme Egg packs from six to five, with only a 20p price reduction. Amid soaring energy prices, fuel bills and food costs, the move is the latest example of manufacturers scrambling against significantly increased production costs, with consumer price index (CPI) inflation forecast to hit 8% in April. Recent examples include Walkers multipacks with fewer bags of crisps, Persil customers getting fewer washes from powder in a box, and Tesco cutting the weight of its mozzarella cheese. While inflation soars to new levels, the tactic is far from new. According to the Office for National Statistics, 206 products shrank in size between September 2015 and June 2017 – the majority of which were food products. For confectionary lovers, the camouflage tactic is particularly noticeable near festive holidays as manufacturers devise new ways to present their goods. In the past, consumers noted paying more for fewer confectionaries from Marks & Spencer and Mars Wrigley near Christmas.",News/Business,Cadbury family-size Dairy Milk bars get 10% smaller but price stays the same,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/28/cadbury-family-size-dairy-milk-bars-get-10-smaller-but-price-stays-the-same
3/29/2022,"After Covid forced its postponement last year, the Women’s Euros are fast approaching with England set to host a tournament bigger and, quite possibly, better than any previous edition. One hundred days before the opening ceremony at Old Trafford on 6 July tickets went on general sale at 8am on Monday morning. By 8.43am all available seats for the final at Wembley on 31 July had sold out and by 9.45am the same applied to the England v Northern Ireland Group A game at Southampton’s St Mary’s on 15 July. Given that more than 350,000 seats available for advance purchase had been snapped up, sales already exceeded the 240,045 bought for the last women’s European Championships, in the Netherlands, in 2017. Tickets have been purchased by a diverse, youthful demographic by residents of 89 countries: 48% of those buying are female and 34% aged under 35. With pricing ranging from £5 to £50 per seat it is expected the opening game between England and Austria at Old Trafford on 6 July will swiftly sell out. Indeed, there is widespread confidence attendances will shatter all sorts of records for women’s games, often by considerable distances. Tickets for all 31 fixtures are available at www.uefa.com/womenseuro/ticketing Second-guessing the latter stages of the 16-team event seems harder than ever. Several countries are fast-improving but it remains likely the winner will emerge from England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. With Russia suspended by Fifa, their replacement’s identity is to be determined but Portugal are the favourites to step in. The Netherlands, the holders and losing 2019 World Cup finalists, have lost Sarina Wiegman, who choreographed the 2017 triumph, to England and are now managed by an Englishman, Mark Parsons. A 35-year-old former Chelsea women’s reserve coach, Parsons impressed in the United States during stints in charge of Washington Spirit and Portland Thorns. The bookmakers fancy Spain’s chances, primarily because of the large numbers of players from Barcelona, the European champions, in their ranks but good as Alex Putellas, Jennifer Hermoso and co are Jorge Vilda’s team are newcomers to the international big time and remain a work in progress. After winning eight of the 12 Women’s Euros, Germany boast formidable pedigree and can never be discounted but they are still arguably in a transitional phase under Martina Voss-Tecklenburg. While France invariably appear strong on paper, they are serial tournament underachievers and do not lack creative tensions under their controversial coach Corinne Diacre. That said, they have just won 10 consecutive games. Meanwhile, Peter Gerhardsson’s Sweden, Olympic silver medallists in Japan, should not be underrated. After reaching the semi-finals of the 2015 and 2019 World Cups and the 2017 European Championships, England are desperate to reach their first final since Euro 2009 in Finland when they lost 6-2 to Germany. The Lionesses seem significantly enhanced under Wiegman. Unbeaten in nine games they have home advantage and top-class talent in Fran Kirby, Lauren Hemp and Lucy Bronze. Even so, they should not underestimate the challenge posed by a potentially awkward Austria and a Norway XI bolstered by the returning Ada Hegerberg’s outstanding attacking talents. The initial group stage also features Northern Ireland, who have qualified for their first major tournament and the largely part-time players are preparing for it by spending seven months away from their day jobs and studies, living as full-time professionals. Northern Ireland do not intend merely making up the numbers. The tournament will take place at Wembley, Brentford, Milton Keynes, Old Trafford, Manchester City’s Academy Stadium, Leigh Sports Village, Sheffield’s Bramall Lane, Rotherham’s New York Stadium, Brighton and Southampton. The only shame is the distinct lack of geographical balance with the north-east’s exclusion appearing extraordinary; surely the 52,000 St James’ Park – situated slap-bang in Newcastle city centre and close to an international airport and mainline railway station – would have been a strong addition? Among other grounds, Bristol City’s Ashton Gate, Plymouth’s Home Park, Norwich’s Carrow Road and Birmingham’s Villa Park would also have made appealing, atmospheric venues but the south-west, East Anglia and the West Midlands have also been omitted from the tournament map. More positively, England’s Arts Council are organising a series of exhibitions and events in all host towns and cities. If this cultural programme can mirror the grace of the Netherlands striker Vivianne Miedema (on view in group stage action in Leigh and Sheffield), the Spain midfielder Alex Putellas (Milton Keynes and Brentford), the France defender Wendie Renard (Rotherham) and England’s centre-forward Ellen White (Manchester, Brighton and Southampton), it should be a big hit.",Sport/Football,Women’s Euro 2022 in England: the state of play with 100 days to go,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/28/womens-euros-2022-england-state-of-play-100-days-to-go
3/29/2022,"Before the screening of this sequel to 2020’s Sonic the Hedgehog started, a representative from the film company asked us to please not spoil any of the film’s big surprises. Human nature being what it is, I spent the whole time anxiously wondering what is the thing I’m not supposed to spoil. That the good guys win in the end? Surely you could have guessed that, dear reader, given the film is clearly aimed at a family audience and features animated characters who first emerged in a video game where no one ever dies, just respawns. There’s not much to spoil about Sonic the Hedgehog 2 because there’s not very much to say about it, other than it’s mildly amusing and reasonably competently assembled. Picking up where the first film left off, bright-blue hedgehog from another dimension Sonic (voiced again by Parks and Recreation’s Ben Schwartz) is still living as a kind of adopted son with Tom (James Marsden), a local cop in the small Montana town of Green Hills, and his veterinarian wife Maddie (Tika Sumpter), both of whom are kindly but not great at pretending to be acting with an animated character they can’t see during filming. But Sonic’s nemesis, Dr Robotnik (Jim Carrey, kind of fantastic but pitching his performance’s energy at the level of a nuclear reactor in meltdown) has been rescued from his exile on the mushroom planet by a new character, a red, muscley echidna (also known as a spiny anteater) named Knuckles, voiced by Idris Elba, who has a beef with Sonic. A third animated creature, a fox with two tails named Tails (Colleen O’Shaughnessey) who clearly attended a school with a good STEM programme, arrives via a magic golden ring portal to help Sonic out. While all this animated running, jumping and smashing is going on with the three primary-coloured beasties, Robotnik cracks wise with his old henchman Stone (Lee Majdoub) who is clearly besotted with Robotnik but can only express his feelings through latte foam art. Meanwhile, Tom and Maddie are off in Hawaii for the wedding of Maddie’s sister Rachel (formidable scene-stealer Natasha Rothwell, a Saturday Night Live alum) and seem to be stuck in an entirely different kind of movie, a comedy of manners and matrimony like one of those 90s/00s movies that starred Owen Wilson or Cameron Diaz. It all sort of comes together in the end, but there’s no earthly reason that it should all have taken two hours. Maybe the spoiler is the unfeasible length of the running time.  Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is released on 1 April in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Sonic the Hedgehog 2 review – no surprises in Sega’s speedy-critter sequel,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-review-no-surprises-in-segas-speedy-critter-sequel
3/29/2022,"Fifty babies, accompanied by their parents, have gathered outside parliament as part of a protest calling for an end to custody in prison for pregnant women. The protest on Monday, attended by women who had previously been in prison when pregnant or after having given birth, or who had been threatened with custodial sentences, along with midwives and advocates for an end to the imprisonment of pregnant women, was organised by Level Up, a feminist organisation fighting gender injustice in the UK, and the campaigning organisation No Births Behind Bars. Two babies have died in women’s prisons in the past three years, when their mothers gave birth without medical assistance at HMP Bronzefield in October 2019, and at HMP Styal in June 2020. Prison inspectors found that both mothers were “failed” by the system. Speakers at the demonstration said the only way to keep pregnant women and new mothers safe was to keep them out of prison and in their communities, where they could access support. The babies wore hairbands in yellow and green Mother’s Day colours and waved diminutive placards in the shadow of Big Ben bearing the words “no babies behind bars”. There are 12 women’s prisons in the UK. Research by the Nuffield Trust found that just over one in 10 women giving birth during a prison sentence did so before they reached hospital – either in the prison or while on transfer to hospital. NHS data has shown a steady increase year-on-year in the number of babies born to women while serving prison sentences – 67 in 2018-19 compared with 43 in 2013-14. Many women in prison are serving short sentences for non-violent offences. Janey Starling, co-director of Level Up, said: “Prison will never, ever be a safe place to be pregnant. The trauma and toxic stress of the prison environment causes lasting harm to both mother and child. It’s time for the government to end the shameful imprisonment of pregnant women and new mothers, and make sure they are supported in the community instead.” Emma Hughes of No Births Behind Bars said: “Nothing has been learned from the horrific deaths of two babies born in jail. Pregnant women and new mothers continue to be imprisoned by UK courts as part of a barbaric and outdated justice system. It is never OK for a baby to be in jail; it is never safe for a woman to go into labour in a cell, and pregnant women and babies in prison are exposed to lethal risks.” The Ministry of Justice has been approached for comment.",News/Society,Female former inmates protest against UK imprisonment of pregnant women,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/28/female-former-inmates-protest-uk-imprisonment-pregnant-women
3/29/2022,"Will Smith has spoken. Chris Rock has spoken. The Academy has spoken. Even the Los Angeles Police Department has spoken. But the person I really want to hear from has remained silent. What does Jada Pinkett Smith think of her husband slapping the Oscars host? What was it that caused Smith to switch from laughing at Rock’s joke about her “GI Jane” look to, less than 10 seconds later, striding onstage, slapping him, marching back to his seat and shouting to the stage, “Keep my wife’s name out your fucking mouth”. After which, in case anyone watching might still have thought it was some kind of pre-rehearsed skit, he shouted the same thing again, and twice as loud. Rock’s gag was personal. Immediately after he said it, Pinkett Smith went stony-faced. She has previously opened up about having alopecia, and how she at first struggled to cope with her hair loss. Were Smith’s actions an attempt to defend her honour? And even if true, why did he feel the need to resort to violence? Some people have expressed concern at the damage caused by the sight of a Black man resorting to violence. I’m less worried about this. Smith is so mainstream that, in many people’s eyes, he’s almost become raceless. And I’ve never had much time for the notion of role models. At best, it’s just a meaningless cliche (the idea that, if we stick a Black person on a pedestal, every child will be inspired – no matter the obstacles placed in their way by a system rigged against them). At worst, it’s a stick to beat all Black people with (“Oh no! Look what he’s done! Now every Black child he inspired will turn into a criminal”). Either way, it makes every prominent Black person a permanent ambassador for their race. Rock has previously taken aim at Smith and Pinkett Smith while hosting the Oscars. In 2016, a ceremony Pinkett Smith had refused to attend due to the lack of diversity among the nominees, Rock said: “Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna’s panties. I wasn’t invited!” He then went on: “Jada’s mad her man Will was not nominated for Concussion. I get it … It’s also not fair that Will was paid $20m for Wild Wild West.” The latter was a critically panned film that Smith had starred in and that he himself has labelled his worst work. Whatever the history, Smith’s expletive-laden outburst, in a show broadcast to millions of homes across the world, shows a total lack of control on his part. It is also a complete contrast to the family image he and his wife have carefully curated for years. The couple met during Smith’s days in the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in the 1990s – a show that endeared him to a generation. Their children, Willow and Jaden, have since become actors and musicians – carrying on the Smith dynasty and attending the Oscars ceremony with them. When Pinkett Smith had an affair with singer August Alsina, she used the admission of her “entanglement” as a point of discussion on her talkshow, Red Table Talk, with Smith present. On the Oscars stage, this image-protection operation blew apart. This was the biggest night of Smith’s career – the night he should have been revelling in the plaudits after winning an Oscar for his brilliant performance as Richard Williams, the father of tennis superstars Venus and Serena. His speech should have been an acceptance of that honour, and a tribute to that remarkable family, in front of both sisters, who were in the audience. But it came half an hour after that slap, so all the audience were thinking was: “Oh my God, why did he do that?” And, in a hole, Smith immediately attempted to justify his actions by saying, “Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family.” He went on to talk about having to “protect people”, including, he said, the female actors he’d worked with on set. What a self-serving display. “To protect” does not mean “to slap someone on their behalf”. This attempt to give violence a bogus morality is at the heart of so much crime. Morgues are filled with the victims of this kind of “protection”. Smith went on to say: “I look like the crazy father – just like they said about Richard.” Smith has proved himself to be no Richard Williams – a man who faced extraordinary abuse, ridicule and violence while coaching his daughters – and who never once responded in kind. Evoking his name to justify his own actions was the lowest of blows by Smith. Smith’s win should have been an opportunity to highlight Williams’ superhuman drive and self-belief, but instead has become a story about a man’s inability to control his emotions. I’m sad that, at the pinnacle of his career, Smith has trashed his own reputation. I’m sadder still that, in their own moment of glory, he chose to taint the Williams family too.

3/29/2022,"The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is under mounting pressure over accusations that his wife, Akshata Murthy, is collecting “bloody money” in dividends from a family company that has refused to pull out of Russia, despite Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Labour and the Liberal Democrats are calling on Sunak to answer “very serious questions” over Murthy’s estimated $900m (£690m) stake in the IT services and consultancy company Infosys. Infosys, which was founded by her billionaire father, NR Narayana Murthy, continues to operate in Russia while most big global IT and consultancy firms such as SAP, Oracle, PwC, McKinsey, Accenture and KPMG have all closed their Russian operations. Sunak, who has repeatedly called on British companies to pull out of Russia in order to “inflict maximum economic pain” on Putin’s regime, refused to comment on his wife’s 0.91% stake in Infosys. Asked by Sky News if his family was “potentially benefiting from Putin’s regime”, Sunak said: “I don’t think that’s the case. I am an elected politician and I am here to talk about what I am responsible for. My wife is not.” A spokesperson for Sunak said neither Murthy nor any members of her family “have any involvement in the operational decisions of the company”. Murthy, who lives with Sunak and their two children at their townhouse in Kensington and Yorkshire manor house, has collected an estimated £11.5m in dividend payments from Infosys over the past year. Lesia Vasylenko, a Ukrainian MP who has taken up arms to defend her country, said money paid out in dividends by any company operating in Russia should be viewed as “bloody money” that had “sponsor[ed] the army”. Asked about Murthy’s holding in Infosys on LBC, Vasylenko said: “Any money that is put into the Russian economy in one way or the other, be it directly, be it through investment, be it through taxes … that money goes to sponsor the army … to buy the bullets that are killing Ukrainian children, Ukrainian women. “Every company has the choice to make, you can run the business as usual and make your money, but you have to live with the fact it’s bloody money, and bloody trade.” Louise Haigh, the shadow transport secretary, told the BBC it was “really quite shocking” that it appeared that “Rishi Sunak’s family itself is benefiting from business in Russia … The chancellor has explicitly called on business to divest from Russia in order to inflict economic pain and ensure that the sanctions are as deeply felt as possible.” The Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, Christine Jardine, said Sunak “needs to come clean and declare any potential conflicts of interest”. “Openness and full transparency are key given the risks posed by financial connections to Russia,” she said. “The public deserves full transparency on this issue. It cannot be one rule for the chancellor and another for everyone else.” In a statement, Infosys said it had “a small team of employees based out of Russia, that services some of our global clients, locally”. “We do not have any active business relationships with local Russian enterprises,” the company said, adding that it had committed $1m to help the victims of the war. Infosys, which was founded by NR Narayana Murthy in 1981 and now has a market value of about $100bn, has strong historical links with Russia and Putin. Murthy welcomed Putin on a tour of Infosys’ Bangalore campus in 2004, during which he said Putin’s “visit to India is an affirmation of the special relationship between our two countries”. “As our bilateral relations expand in scope and depth, surely information technology will be one of the areas in which both countries can collaborate for talent and knowledge,” Murthy said. Infosys has also provided IT and consultancy services for Alfa-Bank, which was last week added to the UK sanctions list.",News/Politics,Sunak under pressure over wife’s Russia-related ‘blood money’ dividends,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/28/sunak-under-pressure-over-wifes-russia-related-blood-money-dividends
3/29/2022,"The Oscars’ audience, both in person and on TV, may have thought they were hallucinating when they watched the on-stage scuffle between Will Smith and Chris Rock last night. Smith may have once been exiled from West Philadelphia as the Fresh Prince of Bel Air, but the best actor nominee – and, later, winner – seemed the man least likely to be at the centre of an awards ceremony punch-up. However it was far from the first time that something unexpected has happened at the Academy Awards – and it’s unlikely to be the last. Here are five more shocking moments from Oscars history. The mother of all Oscars mix-ups occurred in 2017 when the best picture prize was mistakenly handed to Damien Chazelle’s musical hit La La Land, instead of its intended recipient, Barry Jenkins’s queer coming-of-age tale Moonlight. What followed were among the most excruciating scenes ever broadcast on live TV, as florid speeches gave way to the realisation that there had been a colossal mistake. La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz held the card declaring that Moonlight had won aloft, while host Warren Beatty sheepishly explained that he had been given the wrong envelope, and the world winced. At the 2010 awards, director Roger Ross Williams had just launched into his acceptance speech for best documentary short, Music By Prudence, when estranged collaborator Elinor Burkett began one of her own, declaring that “the man never lets the woman speak … isn’t that the classic thing?” Burkett had not been affiliated with the film for a year prior to the ceremony but was still eligible for an Oscar. Only one person was allowed on stage, however – and the pair weren’t on speaking terms. While accepting a best actor award for The Pianist in 2003, Adrien Brody swept Halle Berry into a dramatic on-stage embrace, much to the amusement of the audience and viewers at home. It was a strange episode which – pre #MeToo – was largely laughed off as actorly excess. However, in 2017 Berry – who had won an award the year prior for Monster’s Ball – said that she had been shocked by Brody’s behaviour, using various expletives as she explained that the kiss had been entirely unexpected. In 1974 controversy hit in the form of a stage invasion from photographer and gay rights activist Robert Opel, who had posed as a journalist to sneak backstage. Host David Niven saw the funny side, but took the opportunity to make a quick on-stage dig at Opel, declaring that it was “almost bound to happen … but isn’t it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will get in his life is stripping off and showing his shortcomings”. Elizabeth Taylor was next on, describing the incident as “a pretty hard act to follow”. Having been named best actor at the 1973 awards for The Godfather, Brando memorably sent indigenous actor and activist Sacheen Littlefeather on stage in his place, to denounce the treatment of Native Americans both in Hollywood and in wider society. Avowed racist John Wayne was unsurprisingly vexed, reportedly saying that Brando should have spoken himself rather than sending “a little unknown girl and dressing her up in an Indian outfit”.",Arts/Film,Stage frights: five of the most shocking moments in Oscars history ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/stage-frights-five-of-the-most-shocking-moments-in-oscars-history
3/29/2022,"Jeff Stelling has made a surprise U-turn on his decision to leave Sky Sports’ Soccer Saturday at the end of the season and announced he will present the show for at least another year. Stelling, 67, announced in October this would be his last season fronting Sky’s successful show, and was set to leave in May at the end of the domestic season. However the veteran presenter and Hartlepool fan who has worked at Sky for 30 years has had a change of heart and said on Monday: “Sky Sports is my home, and the Soccer Saturday team are a big part of my life. “As the end of the season approached, and I was preparing to say goodbye, I realised that I was not ready to blow the final whistle and leave the best job in the world. “I am thrilled to be staying, and excited about moving the show forward and creating more special Saturday afternoons on Sky Sports.” It puts to an end the speculation over who could be handed the daunting task of stepping into Stelling’s shoes, and the news clearly came as a relief to the management at Sky, who confirmed Stelling will stay for the 2022-23 season. Jonathan Licht, managing director of Sky Sports, said: “Football fans everywhere will be delighted that Jeff will continue to host Soccer Saturday. “He is a massive part of Saturday afternoon life and everyone at Sky Sports shares the joy this news will bring. We just can’t get enough of Jeff, and can’t wait to bring more of his broadcasting magic to our viewers.”",Sport/Football,Jeff Stelling has change of heart and says he will continue on Soccer Saturday,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/28/jeff-stelling-continue-soccer-saturday-sky-sports
3/29/2022,"A retired vicar accused of sadism repeatedly beat a woman with a bamboo stick for nearly a decade, a crown court jury has found. Hilary Alflatt, 87, had been accused of treating his victim like a slave and forcing her to take a vow of obedience when he worked at a church in Sheffield during the 1980s. He was said to have punished her for looking him in the eye, making her prostate herself before him, kiss his feet and call him “master”’ Having been diagnosed with dementia, Alflatt was judged unfit to stand trial. A jury at Hull crown court was tasked with deciding whether he committed the offences rather than delivering verdicts. On Monday the jury found that he committed actual bodily harm over almost 10 years, repeatedly beating the woman with a bamboo stick. Jurors were unable to decide on a charge that Alflatt branded the shape of a cross on to the woman using a hot needle. He was cleared of three other counts of causing actual bodily harm that related to more time-specific allegations, and two counts of false imprisonment, which included claims that he held her prisoner in a room at the vicarage for five days. Judge Sophie McKone told the jury: “There’s no mystery – you know Mr Alflatt is not here. He has dementia; he is in a nursing home.“Although you found he did the acts in count seven, the court does not punish him for that because he is not fit to take part in the trial. He is not going to go to prison.” She said her options for dealing with the case were to hand down an absolute discharge, to make a guardianship order, or to impose a hospital order. A hearing to decide on this will take place on 3 May. In police interviews, the woman, who cannot be named, said Alflatt had made her take vows of obedience, poverty and chastity. Disobedience, she was told, would be “to disobey God”. The jury also heard from police interviews given by Alflatt, of Northallerton, in which he agreed that some of the alleged incidents had happened. But he said they were consensual. Alflatt, previously known by the first name Malcolm, said the woman had become “hooked” on him after the met in the early 1980s. He was at a “low point” in his marriage and she was “sympathetic”, he said in interviews read to the jury. She began “asking me to do things” including beating her, he said in the interviews. “I felt I had to keep her happy because I was in a relationship which, if it came out, would have destroyed my parish. She had a real hold over me.” He claimed to police that he thought if he “caused her more pain, she would leave me alone”. In her closing speech Louise Reevell, prosecuting, said: “This case is not about an affair and consent, it’s about power, control, depravity and sadism on his part.” In reply, Kathryn Pitters, defending, said: “They formed a romantic relationship, and although some of the proceedings that took place may make you raise an eyebrow, the reality, as he puts it, was: you don’t know what goes on behind closed doors between two consenting adults.”",News/UK news,"Sheffield vicar beat woman for nearly a decade, jury finds",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/28/sheffield-vicar-beat-woman-for-nearly-a-decade-jury-finds
3/29/2022,"It was meant as a gentle nod to the women who farm the often bleak uplands of south-west Britain. But the landlord of a Dartmoor pub has been forced to rethink a decision to bill one of their lunchtime staples not as a “ploughman’s” but a “ploughperson’s”. “It’s caused something of a Twitter storm, hasn’t it?” said Dicky Harrison, landlord of the Tors pub in the Devon village of Belstone. “It was a bit of fun. We’re on Dartmoor and have lots of friends who are farmers – ladies as well as men – who all work the land. It was a nod to the ladies, without being too political. It wasn’t done to cause offence, but women plough too. “I’m not really sure what to do now, to be honest – whether to change it or not. It just seemed the right thing to do at the time.” After an image of the menu went viral, critics accused the pub of “wokeness”. “Won’t be visiting this woke establishment,” said one. “Most people are sick to death of this ridiculous woke cancel culture, please don’t make the excuse this was a bit of fun clearly it wasn’t.” Another said: “Sorry guys, won’t be visiting a ‘woke’ pub for my lunch. Yes, there are lots of women farmers today and I salute them, but stop changing the past.” A third questioned why the pub’s menu had offered “Mama’s chocolate mousse”, claiming all items should be gender neutral. Harrison explained it was called this because it was his mum’s recipe. The ploughperson’s (which costs £12.50) features cheese from Devon, ham roasted with molasses and English mustard, picked onions, chutney and sourdough bread. It has been on the menu for a couple of years and has occasionally raised a smile or prompted a chat – but there had been no outcry until now. On Monday, local female farmers sprung to the pub’s defence, with one, Michaela Reddaway, posing for a photo with a pitchfork and chickens in front of the pub. She farms sheep and cattle and has worked in agriculture since she was a child, when she helped out her grandparents. “I don’t think the name is an issue really,” said Reddaway, who was out of breath when she spoke to the Guardian “because I’ve been chasing sheep around”. She saw it as a bit of fun. “It was a tongue-in-cheek thing, but the role of women in farming definitely needs to be highlighted. It’s still considered a male-dominated role, but there are loads of women – and more and more all the time. It’s not just men driving the tractor; it’s women too.” Kelly Gilbert, bar manager at the Tors and a smallholder on Dartmoor who keeps chickens and sheep, said she was surprised that the row had blown up. “Men and women do the same jobs here, there’s no discrimination,” she said. “When I saw ploughperson’s on the menu, it tickled me – it wasn’t political. When you walk into Belstone, you could be walking back 100 years, but everyone, men and women, work the moor. The women don’t get snubbed just because they are women and the men don’t get snubbed because they are men.”",News/UK news,Devon pub reaps Twitter storm after adding ploughperson’s to menu,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/28/devon-pub-reaps-twitter-storm-after-adding-ploughpersons-to-menu
3/29/2022,"‘This is the best bit,” says Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson, the drummer, DJ and tastemaker behind Summer of Soul, one of the films up for best documentary at the 2022 Oscars. He’s surveying the ground floor of the Dolby theatre like a laser-focused shaman, waiting coolly until his category is announced. Sure, there’s a ceremony going on inside the area, where slaps are being served quicker than the canapés, but outside in the beige-carpeted lobby of the world’s most prestigious film event is where the other action happens. There’s Jake Gyllenhaal and brother-in-law Peter Sarsgaard in cahoots at the bar. Best supporting actor nominee Kodi Smit-McPhee, in a sky-blue suit and studded creepers, hugging The Power of the Dog director Jane Campion. Benedict Cumberbatch taking a breather, aware, perhaps, that most of the auditorium has by now seen his penis. Thompson, the musical director of last year’s Oscars, who DJed in an empty Union station during the 2021 ceremony, must be the only person to have thought it was any good despite the ratings disaster. “I liked it!” he says. But now it’s an Oscars reboot: smaller categories controversially nipped and tucked, a fully mask-less event (though with 800 fewer seats) and a new master of ceremonies packing a punch – that’s telecast producer Will Packer – hoping to draw in a younger audience with musical numbers from Encanto. Thompson returns for 2022 as a film director and his producer, Joseph Patel, is quietly confident that they will take home a trophy. “I’ve got a good feeling,” he says. That’s the general vibe in the air tonight: convivial, conspiratorial and relief at being back to normal, albeit in a bubble very far away from other more pressing realities. Not that you can really call the Academy Awards normal. Allow me to rewind and walk you up the red carpet. First, you arrive at the fenced off Oscars compound and, if you look famous enough, get a golf buggy that whizzes you past the back of the paparazzi gauntlet to the entrance. There, the plebs and the beautiful people are briefly thrust together, shuffling along like lemmings in their gowns and stilettos with the air of an awkward high school prom. It turns out that the Covid clearance queue is a great place for a celeb encounter, which is where I meet Daniel Durant, one of the actors from tonight’s best picture winner Coda, and the first of the film’s cast to arrive. It’s also his first major movie and, like mine, his first Oscars, and we’re both early and waiting around, unsure what to do. “We’re popping our cherry!” he says through a sign language interpreter, as the sun beats down unfavourably on everyone in a tux. “I was told it would be cold,” he adds. Further on, the red carpet cleaves in two. One one side, Jessica Chastain, sequined fairy princess, can be seen wafting past the flashbulbs. On the other, everyone else is ushered through by 10 airports’ worth of security guards as we try to squint through the gaps. Luckily, there is a DJ to unite us all. The same can’t be said inside the venue, however. The civilians are banished to the fifth floor where they can’t bother the A-listers, and the lower floors are split by rank, with hors d’oeuvres and the toast of Hollywood at the bottom. “It’s like a class system!” says Melanie Annan, one of the editors on documentary short nominee Three Songs for Benazir. The one place where everyone is equal is the ladies’ loos. “I can’t get the knickers off,” someone bleats from a stall, which a woman in a fishtail dress is also secretly thinking. With security guard-dodging stealth, however, I traipse up and down the staircase. Two floors down it’s a family affair, where all the mums and makeup artists are hanging out. I help zip one back into her outfit, and meet Cruella makeup artist Julia Vernon’s mother, a Brit who is thrilled to have been brought to something so glitzy. Her daughter appears in a cloud of grey netting, having just been pipped to the trophy by The Eyes of Tammy Faye. “I don’t know how long it’s going to last,” she says, patting the bosom of her floofy dress. But she’s not a sore loser. “It’s the first film that’s been nominated for crowd makeup, so I’m chuffed with that. It’s just nice to be here.” It’s nice, for sure, but then there are murmurs. Something about a Chris Rock joke. Something about a Will Smith slap. “It’s a madhouse,” says one of the many identical looking men around me, probably a producer. Word comes from inside the ceremony that Smith walked on stage and hit Rock live on air; nobody on the floor can tell if it’s staged or sincere. If people’s faces weren’t frozen with Botox already, now they’re frozen with disbelief. “I’m more than a little freaked out by what happened,” says one woman huddled around the phone-charging station. “That was real,” insists another. Later, we attentively watch Smith’s best actor acceptance speech for King Richard on the screens; Alfred Molina yells “turn it up” and the bar area goes quiet. Then it’s over and no one knows quite what to say. All this is more dramatic than a thousand Jarvis Cocker moons, but it’s a shame that it will detract from some of the positive aspects of the awards this year. Patel and Thompson come through the doors triumphant, having won their category for Summer of Soul. “People talk shit about the Oscars, but I didn’t see anyone like me – brown and from an immigrant background – doing this when I was growing up,” Patel had told me earlier. “If someone sees this and it gives them permission, then that’s what it’s about.” On the screen behind us, Troy Kotsur had been accepting his award for best actor in a supporting role for Coda, the first deaf man to do so. “Millions of kids around the world are going to watch that and feel like they can do that, too,” Patel says. Ultimately, the Oscars isn’t just about seeing famous people air-kiss and thank their mums or misbehave, it’s about everyone else feeling seen themselves. One person I talk to says they witnessed a queer Latinx server filming the screen and crying when Ariana DeBose, who is openly queer and of Latin descent, won best supporting actress. (In a neat swish of Oscars circularity, the only other actor of Latin descent to have won the award was Rita Moreno, when she played the same part in West Side Story.) Outside the ladies’ loos, I have my own flash of feeling seen, thanks to none other than Olivia Colman. In a moment that cruelly wasn’t televised and which I shall dine out on for years to come, the actor, resplendent in silver pleated lamé, told me that she loved my dress. Just to show you how divided the Oscars really are, however, newly minted Oscar winner Jane Campion, also in the loos and never one to mince her words, said that it looked “nice and comfy”. I guess you really can’t win ’em all.",Arts/Film,A loo with a view: on the ground at the Oscars with the celebs and the civilians,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/a-loo-with-a-view-on-the-ground-at-the-oscars-with-the-celebs-and-the-civilians
