12/30/2021,"No in the New Year is Yahoo Life’s series about the power of saying no, establishing boundaries and prioritizing your own physical and mental health. For some people who imbibe, the champagne toast at midnight on New Year’s Eve is the last drop of alcohol they typically touch for the next month. That’s the official start of Dry January, an initiative that was originally started in 2012 by Alcohol Change UK in order to get people to see the mental, physical, and even financial benefits of living without alcohol. Yet most people who participate in Dry January have no intention of quitting alcohol for good — completing the month-long break is the goal. However, if the point of Dry January is to feel better and be overall healthier, is 30 days (or in January's case, 31) even enough? Unfortunately, the experts Yahoo Life spoke with all agreed that 30 days isn’t enough time to reset your body after years of drinking regularly. However, there may be other surprising benefits of trying out sobriety in the short term. According to Dr. George F. Koob, the director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, participating in Dry January can be a great way to learn more about your drinking habits, which can help you make healthier choices moving forward. “There are many potential benefits to taking a break from alcohol if done wisely,” Koob tells Yahoo Life. “At the very least, taking a break from alcohol gives a person a chance to evaluate their relationship with alcohol and cultivate alternatives for relaxing, socializing, coping and other reasons why people drink."" It can also shed light on how drinking alcohol affects your physical and mental health. ""Some people might discover that their alcohol use was irritating their stomach, disrupting their sleep, contributing to weight gain, interfering with their morning exercise routine, affecting their relationships, or that they relied more on alcohol for stress relief than they thought,"" says Koob. ""Waking up without the fatigue, malaise and other common symptoms of hangovers could potentially improve a person’s quality of life. And for some people the financial savings could be substantial.” In terms of purely the physical results of Dry January, heavy drinkers may find they see the biggest change, Dr. Tyler Oesterle, medical director of the Mayo Clinic Health System’s Foundation Centers, tells Yahoo Life. “Alcohol is toxic to a lot of organ systems in the body,"" Oesterle says. ""It can affect the liver, pancreas, heart and the nervous system, just to name a few. One month of abstinence, if any of these organ systems are compromised, could improve acute symptoms. For example, if individuals are heavy drinkers and have suffered some liver damage, then abnormalities in their liver enzymes can improve over the first 30 days."" Oesterle adds: ""There may also be other improvements for heavy drinkers in the first 30 days depending on the physical impact of their alcohol use. If an individual is a light drinker, the one month abstinence can be used to establish a new abstinence-based habit. However, it is not really enough time to make any significant difference physically for light drinkers.” Click and scroll in the window below to explore the body after 30 days without alcohol. Elective sobriety coach Amanda Kuda agrees that, while 30 days may not be enough time to make any meaningful physical changes, it can be a great start for someone who is sober curious. For those who might worry about the stigma of giving up alcohol, Dry January offers a built-in excuse to be sober, especially after what is most likely the “most intense drinking period of the year,” she says. Kuda explains that “Dry January is a socially acceptable way to take a step back from alcohol, in a world that’s obsessed with booze. If you live in a place where alcohol is something you’re expected to participate in, Dry January is a perfect opportunity for you to take a step back without anyone questioning your motives. It offers you the opportunity to take a step back and say, ‘Is this something I want to explore further?’ I see 30 days as a great catapult to a longer term change, as well as a short-term break for your body.” While she notes that people who believe they may have an alcohol dependency should consult with a medical professional before going cold turkey, even for 30 days, overall Kuda thinks Dry January can be “a great opportunity to be observant about our behavior around alcohol.” It might even encourage you to continue the sober experiment past January 31. “Anyone can do anything for 30 days,” Kuda says, “but that real change in your relationship with alcohol is when you can extend it and see how it goes longer term.” For those who are looking forward to or are curious about trying out alcohol-free living, even in the short-term, it’s now easier than ever, Kuda says. “There are so many amazing non-alcoholic alternatives that you probably love to drink right now,"" Kuda says. ""There are non-alcoholic wines, spirits, beers, that come pretty close to the real thing. If you’re looking for something special to enjoy, there are now so many options to make you feel included.""

12/30/2021,"Creators who are a part of YouTube's Partner Program can monetize their videos with ads. YouTubers can make thousands of dollars each month from the program. Eight creators with 1 million subscribers or more shared how much money they make on YouTube. This is the latest installment of Insider's YouTube money logs, where creators break down how much they earn. Surpassing the 1 million subscriber mark on YouTube is a huge milestone, and, in practical terms, it often means a creator can earn a full-time living from the platform. YouTube creators earn money a number of ways, but money from the ads that play in their videos usually constitutes a big chunk of their income. Andrei Jikh, a finance YouTuber with 1.7 million subscribers, has earned $1.6 million in ad revenue in less than three years, for example. Read a full breakdown of how much Jikh has made this year so far and how he's done it. Another YouTuber, lifestyle creator Tiffany Ma, earns up to $11,500 a month from ads on her videos, she told Insider. Read a full breakdown of how much Ma money earns per month and how she grew her channel. To start earning money directly from YouTube, creators must have at least 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours in the past year. Once they reach that threshold, they can apply for YouTube's Partner Program, which allows them to start monetizing their channels through ads, subscriptions, and channel memberships. For every 1,000 ad views, advertisers pay a certain rate to YouTube. YouTube takes 45% of the revenue, and the creator gets the rest. Two key metrics for earning money on YouTube are the CPM rate, or how much money advertisers pay YouTube per 1,000 ad views, and RPM rate, which is how much revenue a creator earns per every 1,000 video views after YouTube's cut. Some subjects, like personal finance and cryptocurrency, can boost a creator's ad rate by attracting lucrative advertisers. ""The ad revenue for crypto is a lot higher than anything else finance-related, like credit cards or banks,"" Jikh told Insider. While Ma's lifestyle content makes less money, she's perfected a strategy to maximize payout. ""To really optimize your audience, I think YouTubers should definitely put three to four ads within a video,"" Ma said. Many of these creators make money outside YouTube as well. Graham Stephan, who has 3.4 million subscribers, launched his own coffee brand, for instance. (Read how he did it, what it cost, and how much he's made in our interview with Stephan.) But the money made directly from YouTube forms a key pillar of many creators' incomes. Here are 8 exclusive earnings breakdowns in which YouTubers with 1 million followers or more share exactly how much they earn from the platform: Nate O'Brien has 1.1 million subscribers and films videos about personal-finance Kevin David has 1.3 million subscribers and films videos about ecommerce  Marina Mogilko has 1.3 million subscribers and films business-related videos Michael Groth has 1.5 million subscribers and films Pokémon-related videos Shelby Church has 1.6 million subscribers and films tech and lifestyle videos Andrei Jikh has 1.7 million subscribers and films videos about cryptocurrency  Tiffany Ma has 1.8 million subscribers and films lifestyle videos Graham Stephan has 3.4 million subscribers and films personal-finance videos Read the original article on Business Insider",Business/Business Insider,How much money YouTubers with 1 million subscribers make,https://news.yahoo.com/much-money-youtubers-1-million-124853437.html

The total December snowfall was 202.1 inches, the University of California's Berkeley Central Sierra Snow Lab reported on Tuesday (December 28), breaking the record of 179 inches in 1970. Tahoe's major motorways were closed due to the snow and downed trees. The eyewitness told Reuters that he and his neighbors spent two days clearing their driveways of snow. However, in spite of the difficulties in clearing the pile-up, he maintained that his community still loves the snow and even took to skiing down a freshly snow-covered road.",Science/Reuters Videos,Watch this December timelapse of snow dumping in Lake Tahoe,https://news.yahoo.com/watch-december-timelapse-snow-dumping-191321576.html
