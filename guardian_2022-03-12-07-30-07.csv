3/12/2022,"The UN security council met on Friday at Russia’s request to discuss Moscow’s claims that the US is funding “military biological activities” in Ukraine – in other words, secretly developing biological weapons in Ukrainian laboratories. The event saw some heated discussion. The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, evoked the terrifying specter of an “uncontrolled spread of bio agents from Ukraine” across Europe. His American counterpart, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, warned that Russia’s claim could be a pretext for it launching its own biological weapons attack on Ukraine. So what is the dispute all about, and what is actually happening inside Ukraine? How did “bio labs” become the latest front in the Ukraine information war? Last Sunday the Russian ministry of foreign affairs posted a tweet accusing the US and Ukrainian governments of running a secret “military-biological programme” inside the stricken country. Moscow claimed that its invading forces had discovered evidence of an “emergency clean-up” to hide the programme. Moscow went on to claim that it had found documents related to the secret US operation in laboratories in the Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv and Poltava. The allegations were quickly amplified by China, which supported the claims during Friday’s UN security council debate. The theory also took on a life of its own on social media under the hashtag #usbiolabs, and found a welcome home among rightwing outlets in the US including the War Room podcast of Donald Trump’s former White House adviser Steve Bannon and the Fox News primetime show hosted by Tucker Carlson. How have the US and Ukrainian governments responded? Both the US and Ukraine have categorically denied that they are developing any biological weapons inside the country. At Friday’s meeting, the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said: “I will say this once: ‘Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program.’” She went on to turn the accusation back on Moscow. “It is Russia that has long maintained a biological weapon program in violation of international law.” Ukraine’s ambassador to the world body, Sergiy Kyslytsya, used more colourful language. He called the idea being advanced by Russia “a bunch of insane delirium”. What are independent world bodies saying? The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is unaware of activity by Ukraine violating any international treaty, including the ban on biological weapons. The UN high commissioner for disarmament, Izumi Nakamitsu, confirmed that the UN was not aware of any biological weapons programmes in Ukraine. Nakamitsu pointed to the Biological Weapons Convention, which has prohibited the development and use of biological weapons since 1975. The convention was backed by then president Richard Nixon, who in 1969 also put a stop to the US developing its own offensive biological weapons. So do bio labs exist inside Ukraine, and is the US supporting them? Yes, and yes. Ukraine does operate biological laboratories which receive US funding. The US undersecretary of state Victoria Nuland affirmed those facts in a Senate foreign relations committee hearing this week in which the Republican senator Marco Rubio asked her directly whether Ukraine had biological weapons. Nuland did not answer the question head on. “Ukraine has biological research facilities,” she replied, adding that there was concern that Russian forces were trying to gain control of the labs. “We are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces.” Nuland’s comments were seized upon by far-right commentators as further evidence of a secret US-Ukraine plot. In fact, US funding to the laboratories had its roots in the fall of the Soviet Union after which money was pumped into Ukraine and other former Soviet countries to help them transfer scientific skills away from weapons programmes towards public health initiatives. The scheme was originally known as the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) programme, but is now more commonly referred to as the biological engagement programme. It has been successful in supporting former Soviet and other countries to fulfil public health obligations. “This is one of the best things that we do,” Dr Gigi Gronvall, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told the Guardian. Most of the work of the Ukraine labs today, Gronvall said, involved surveillance of diseases in animals and people as an early-warning system for illnesses such as African swine fever, which is endemic in the region. “We know pathogens don’t respect borders, so helping to put out public health fires before they become too big is an advantage to all of us,” she said. Do the Ukraine laboratories store dangerous biological agents? Yes, it appears so. As part of their work researching diseases the bio labs do seem to hold dangerous pathogens. We know that because WHO is urging Ukraine to destroy any highly dangerous agents in its laboratories to avoid the risk of a disastrous outbreak should one of the labs be hit under Russian attack. “As part of this work, WHO has strongly recommended to the ministry ofhealth in Ukraine and other responsible bodies to destroy high-threatpathogens to prevent any potential spills,” the UN health agency said. The WHO has worked in Ukraine for several years helping the bio labs improve their safety and security, so it knows what it is talking about. If Russian claims of a secret bioweapons programme are fake news, does that mean there is nothing to worry about? No. In addition to the threat of pathogens held in Ukrainian labs leaking out or falling into the hands of Russian forces, there is the threat of Russia potentially launching its own biological weapons attack. The assessment of the US state department is that Russia continues to maintain an offensive biological weapons programme in violation of the convention that it has signed. Earlier this week, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, accused Russia under Vladimir Putin of having a “long and well-documented track record” of using chemical weapons, pointing to the poisoning of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny and Russia’s support of the Syrian regime while it deployed chemical weapons. She went on to warn that Moscow’s claim of a secret biological weapons programme in Ukraine could in fact be laying the foundations for a Russian chemical or biological weapons assault inside Ukraine. That possibility leaves even seasoned experts rattled. “I hope that this is more of a disinformation talking point than an actual thing,” Gronvall said. “I guess we shall see.”",News/World news,What are Russia’s biological weapons claims and what’s actually happening?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/russia-biological-weapon-claim-us-un-ukraine-bio-labs-explainer
3/12/2022,"On the eve of the first Test, at the ground that carries his name, the great Sir Vivian Richards was asked about the absence of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad but instead decided to largely ignore the question and deliver a hymn of praise for Zak Crawley. “A magnificent player,” purred Richards, urging England to give the 24-year-old time to flourish; to accept that, as a tall right-hander with an array of attacking shots at the top of the order, the first phase of his Test career may be hit and miss. The talents that caught the eye of Richards were in evidence on the fourth day, Crawley strumming his second century for England that, along with 84 not out for Joe Root, gave England control of the match heading into the final day. The tourists closed on 217 for one from 63.2 overs when rain lashed down at 5pm local time, having given themselves a sniff of victory through a lead of 153, even if the draw is clearly the heavy favourite on this moribund pitch. Trickier surfaces lie ahead but Crawley’s elegant unbeaten 117 from 200 balls should do plenty for his confidence, having gone 21 innings without a three-figure score since his 267 against Pakistan in 2020. The smile upon reaching the milestone here, nudging Jayden Seales into the leg-side for two precious runs after tea and delighting the visiting supporters with it, suggested as much. An unbroken second-wicket stand of 193 from 52.1 overs between Crawley and his captain also represented a boon for a top order that was shredded in Australia and last year found itself five down for 67 runs or fewer on eight occasions. So while conditions helped hugely, there was still pressure here. Winkling out the final West Indies wicket first thing – the hosts finally bowled out for 375 from 157 gruelling overs – England were staring at a deficit of 64 runs. In light of those recent struggles, one could not rule out the possibility of faces being left as red as some of those among the Barmy Army. There was an inauspicious start to their innings too, Crawley’s new opening partner, Alex Lees, seeing his Test debut end with scores of four and six. For the second time in the match, Kemar Roach followed a succession of outswingers to the left-hander with one that speared into his front pad. Having seen seven decisions overturned by this point in the contest, Lees reviewed instantly but instead became the first England opener to make two single-figure scores on debut since Hugh Morris in 1991; at least historical comfort can be drawn from the fact that the last Yorkshire-born cricketer on this list was one Len Hutton in 1937. He went OK. With this came the end of England’s third-highest opening partnership of the winter – just 24 runs – but Root strode out in his new position back at No 3 and soon quelled any concerns, with he and Crawley calmly pushing their side into the lead by lunch, reaching 72 for one, and then 146 for one by tea. The runs came quicker than the previous day and the West Indies attack were left searching for answers once the ball went soft. Crawley was in murderous mood when they strayed, his 16 fours crisply struck either square of the wicket or behind, taking 100 balls to reach his half-century and then 81 more to double it. Even on a road, his execution was still reward for those present. It was the left-arm spin of Axar Patel that led to Crawley’s career stalling in India last year but with the pitch failing to break up here, his equivalent, Veerasammy Permaul, could offer no such threat. When Kraigg Brathwaite then started bowling his achingly slow off-spin from the other end, freebies were in abundance and both set batsmen helped themselves. Having earlier overturned an lbw shout from Roach with the new ball, the only other heart in mouth moment came when Crawley was on 71 and a flick to leg off Permaul ended up in the hands of slip. West Indies went up, convinced it had struck his boot on the full before the catch. But with an on-field ‘soft-signal’ of not out, the TV umpire, Leslie Reifer, did not have conclusive evidence to give it. Otherwise it was a cruise for Crawley and Root, while for England there was still optimism that Mark Wood may be able to bowl on the fifth day after the elbow injury that struck five overs into his work on the third. Whether this would be wise, given the likelihood of a stalemate, is another matter.",Sport/Sport,Zak Crawley lives up to Viv Richards’ billing to wrest control from West Indies,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/11/west-indies-england-first-test-day-four-match-report
3/12/2022,"Everybody knew the sanctions were coming; they had been inevitable, according to UK government sources. Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner, was in their crosshairs because of his links to Vladimir Putin, which had moved beyond the pale after Russia’s senseless invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich himself knew they were coming. Hence his decision to try to sell his UK assets, including Chelsea. But when they did arrive at 9am on Thursday, they were still able to blindside the Chelsea hierarchy. On Wednesday, they had certainly not anticipated the imposition of them the following morning. The club entered a state of shock. So many questions, so few answers. Some of the players were concerned about what the future held for them – given that one of the measures involved Chelsea not being able to operate in the transfer market or offer new contracts. Ditto many members of staff. What did it all mean? As the day progressed, the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, sent an email to the clubs. It was still early, nothing felt concrete, but there was a business-as-usual tone to his note. Masters reassured everybody that Chelsea would complete their remaining fixtures of the season. The integrity of the competition would not be compromised and it was a theme picked up by Thomas Tuchel. “As long as we have enough shirts and as long as the bus is full of fuel we will arrive and we will be competitive,” the Chelsea manager said. The players have been told to concentrate on what they can influence, which they did on Thursday night with the 3-1 win at Norwich, keeping them third. Next is the visit of Newcastle to Stamford Bridge on Sunday which, it is fair to say, will be flavoured by ownership issues. But what kind of Chelsea will emerge from the sanctions which have set them on a path to ruin? The first thing to say is that the world and European champions, who have won 21 trophies since Abramovich’s takeover in 2003 – more than any other English club during the period – will surely not be put out of business, however hard the financial restrictions that have been brought against them appear. There is still time to find a buyer and for them to stabilise the operation, especially if the deal were done by 31 May – when the club’s special licence to carry on is due to expire. There remain plenty of interested parties, who can only see Chelsea’s price dropping as sponsors pull out or consider their associations; as revenue streams are hit. Moreover, the government, which is effectively in charge of the sale – given the sanctions against Abramovich would not allow him to profit from it – have an interest in the transaction going through. They want Abramovich out for obvious reasons, including the optics, and they do not want to send Chelsea to the wall as they consider the club to be of cultural significance to the country. If Abramovich were to remain as the owner into next season, with sanctions biting ever deeper, that could happen. Could Abramovich dig in and take the ship down with him? Given everything we know about him and his love for Chelsea, his desire to hand over to responsible owners, it feels unlikely. And, in any case, the government have reserved the right to requisition the club, as a last resort, and sell it themselves. They have given Abramovich no room for manoeuvre, forcing him away, and, if there is financial pain for the club, it is at a level they believe they will get through. On a related point, as Chelsea potentially encounter difficulties in satisfying the league’s profit and sustainability rules, there does not seem to be a desire among the other clubs for them to be driven under. They recognise that a strong Chelsea is important for the collective brand. The league, meanwhile, is always loth to create a mess with points deductions, for example. Again, it is not good for the competition. If Chelsea were to fall foul of profit and sustainability, they would be expected to cite unforeseen circumstances, much as some clubs have claimed Covid writedowns: their books would have been sound but for the pandemic. Chelsea continue to try to process the sanctions and argue against some of them. Many areas of the business stand to be affected, with the government wanting to ensure that any revenue generated by the club cannot find its way back to the Putin regime. A part of the nervousness at Chelsea involves whether any more sponsors will follow the telecommunications and internet service provider Three in withdrawing support, at least temporarily. There are normally anti-embarrassment clauses in such arrangements and, from a corporate social responsibility point of view, the upside of standing by a tarnished individual is often outweighed by the downside. The Three deal is worth £40m a year, although it is unclear how much more, if anything, was due to Chelsea before the end of the season. The kit contract with Nike is the big one – it is worth £60m a year. The ticketing and merchandising sanctions should not hit too hard, as the end of the season looms, but there could be larger holes with the final portion of the broadcast deal and the prize money from the Premier League and Uefa to be frozen. If Chelsea were to finish third in the league, it would be worth about £34m. Then there are the sums that Abramovich would be permitted to invest within the parameters of the profit and sustainability rules – £105m over a rolling three-year period. That, plainly, has stopped and so, to repeat, it is imperative that the transfer of ownership happens with a degree of speed. What is clear is that Chelsea will live a different reality without Abramovich and there is a strong chance that it will not be as exciting. In football terms, he was the ideal owner: no money constraints; an individual motivated purely by aggrandisement, to succeed year after year. Abramovich’s day of reckoning has come. Chelsea have the memories and the conflicting emotions.",Sport/Football,Chelsea are in crisis but there is no will to leave club on their knees | David Hytner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/chelsea-in-crisis-but-there-is-no-will-to-leave-club-on-their-knees-roman-abramovich
3/12/2022,"Four down, one to go. France’s mission for the grand slam, and their first title since 2010 rumbles on, but how Wales made them work for it. Les Bleus were fancied to dominate the defending champions but, as they have demonstrated so often, the Welsh are not easily intimidated. An early try by Anthony Jelonch ultimately proved decisive but the life was so nearly squeezed from the French grand slam attempt on an incredibly nervy night. But they won ugly, and will welcome England to Paris next weekend going for a clean sweep. Josh Navidi was the latest seasoned campaigner to return to the Welsh back row among four changes made by Wayne Pivac, and slotted in at No 7 alongside Taulupe Faletau at No 8. Seb Davies, usually a lock, was selected at No 6 to bring extra power along with his impressive stature at lineout time. There had been copious pre-match grumbling about ticket pricing and the logistics of a Friday night match, and the vast swathes of empty seats at the Principality Stadium were obvious before kick-off. The roof was open and it became a crisp, cold evening after a pre-match deluge. Not that the weather, the open roof, or the number of fans present looked likely to concern the grand-slam chasing visitors. Fabien Galthié’s side looked ready for business, huddled together near halfway long before Wales emerged from the tunnel. France looked dangerous from the off. The scrum-half Antoine Dupont ghosted through a midfield gap and off-loaded to the giant second row Paul Willemse. Melvyn Jaminet caressed a penalty through the posts after Wales’s Navidi was penalised at a ruck. Biggar immediately levelled from the tee when France were punished for obstruction. When the lively Toulon wing Gabin Villiere made a dart on the French left, the Welsh defence initially reset themselves, but even a thunderous hit by Ryan Elias could not prevent Les Bleus crossed the try-line. Jaminet ruthlessly capitalised on a simple overlap, off-loading to Jelonch who jogged over. Jaminet converted, and it was an ominously effective score from a Welsh perspective. Would Wales roll over? Of course they wouldn’t – even if they lost Tomos Williams, the scrum-half, who took a heavy blow to the head in trying to tackle Jonathan Danty. Another Biggar penalty reduced what had become a seven-point deficit after the wing Alex Cuthbert kicked ahead. The Welsh passing game started to fizz a little, while the powerful carries by Navidi and Faletau began to punch a hole or two. France were under pressure, and a stunning 50-22 kick by Biggar bought the field position for another penalty by the Wales fly-half, which made it a one-point game. Jaminet’s limp attempt at a drop-goal from long range hinted at the pressure that Galthié’s side had been under. There was a sense when they emerged for the second half that France had gathered themselves and refocused, no doubt thanks in part to some pointed words from Shaun Edwards, the former Wales defence coach who helped to mastermind so many memorable results here in the past. Jaminet cracked over a straightforward penalty to edge France four points in front. A tense third quarter ensued, punctuated by a singing competition between the Welsh and French fans, battling each other to produce the loudest volume as a nervous finish beckoned. France nursed their four-point advantage into the final quarter – but invited pressure on to themselves when Danty knocked on and gifted the hosts a scrum on the visitors’ 22. They escaped with their slender lead in tact and were soon threatening at the other end, the fly-half Romain Ntamack drifting an attempted drop-goal narrowly wide as Galthié’s men continued to search for a decisive score. It took on the shape of a match that France would surely have lost before Edwards instilled such discipline in their defensive ranks. Thibaud Flament of Toulouse, fresh from the replacements bench, was arguably fortunate to escape a yellow card after tipping the wing Josh Adams over in a tackle. Faletau, again bursting with intent and industry in attack and defence, sprinted into space on the right but the French kept tackling and kept their shape. With seven minutes left, Wales steamed forward into the French 22 only for a brilliant interception by Ntamack from Biggar to relieve the pressure. Jaminet missed a late kick at goal but it didn’t matter. France held firm.

3/12/2022,"As Andy Murray began a pivotal season in this late period of his career, one of the small, humble goals he has frequently said he hoped to achieve was a 700th career win on the ATP tour. It is a feat that only 17 other men’s players have achieved in the history of the sport, generally a sign of historic excellence. On Friday, in the first round of the BNP Paribas Open, Murray pulled off his milestone victory in a typically gritty match filled with resilience in absence of his top level. After suffering a battering in the first set and trailing 1-3 in the final set, Murray recovered to defeat Taro Daniel of Japan 1-6, 6-2, 6-4. “It means a lot,” Murray said. “It was a target I set myself towards the end of last year and with everything that has gone on the last few years it has not been easy to get there. Great achievement, not a lot of guys have been able to do it.” Despite being a rare lower-ranked opponent for Murray, Daniel has started the year playing some of his best tennis, which he demonstrated most notably at the Australian Open by handing Murray one of the worst grand slam losses of his career, winning 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 in their second round match. While Murray responded by dominating Daniel last month in Doha, Daniel burst into their third match in three months at a high level. He served well, controlled the baseline and showed how he has infused his smart counterpunching with a heavier forehand. While Daniel was faultless throughout the first set, Murray’s shot quality was poor as he continually dropped the ball short. But he cleaned up his forehand in the second set and after trailing 1-3 in the final set, he recovered to 4-3. With Daniel serving to stay in the match at 4-5, Murray refused to miss and clinched an essential win. The victory additionally marked the start of what Murray hopes is a new stage in this part of his career; his first match since he announced that Ivan Lendl would be returning to his team as coach. Lendl has been one of the most important figures in Murray’s career and he was Murray’s coach during each of his three grand slam victories. Murray has said that amid many doubts about his ability to consistently compete at the highest level, the mere fact Lendl still believes that he is capable of doing so and was willing to help him has given him confidence. He is planning to begin training with Lendl after the Miami Open. “There are things I need to work on in the practice court consistently to change them,” said Murray. “I don’t really have time to do that just now but I’m trying my hardest to do the things that I need to do to compete against the best players. “There were signs of that today but it’s not consistent enough and not from the beginning of the match. I do think I can get there, I really do, but it’s going to take a lot of work on the practice court.” For now, however, Murray moves on in California and will next face 31st seed Alexander Bublik.",Sport/Sport,Andy Murray roars back at Indian Wells to bring up 700th career victory,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/11/andy-murray-roars-back-at-indian-wells-to-bring-up-700th-career-victory
