5/4/2022,"Psychologist Dr Dawn Hughes on Tuesday (3 May) testified that Johnny Depp “kicked” Amber Heard “in the back” in a jealous rage over James Franco. Dr Hughes was the first witness who testified on behalf of Ms Heard after Mr Depp’s lawyers rested their case on Tuesday, following more than three weeks of evidence and testimony in the defamation suit brought by the Pirates of the Carribbean actor against his ex-wife. While she was on the stand, Dr Hughes claimed Mr Depp perpetrated multiple acts of sexual and physical violence against Ms Heard over the course of their tumultous marriage, which ended in divorce in 2016. Dr Hughes referred to the “Boston plane incident” which reportedly occurred on 24 May 2014 when “Ms Heard and Mr Depp were going to fly back to LA and spend the weekend together” because they had been on shoot at separate locations. “Ms Heard is on the plane, waiting for Mr Depp to come on. He’s reportedly sitting in the SUV smoking weed and drinking. She is filming with James Franco at this point,” Dr Hughes said. “He gets on the plane and starts talking about James Franco, making a lot of derogatory comments about her. ‘Hope you had fun with your escapades’ and some more inflammatory language,” she added. “Then in an argument when she got up to leave, he kicked her in the back. She went forward on the plane, to the front of the plane.” Ms Heard and Mr Franco were shooting in New York for their then-forthcoming film The Adderall Diaries, and were photographed on set by paparazzi on 30 May 2014. During Mr Depp’s libel suit against UK-based The Sun newspaper over an article which branded him a “wife-beater”, the 58-year-old actor denied the accusations and told the court he slept in the bathroom for the rest of the flight. Last week, it was reported that Mr Franco – who was listed as a potential witness for Ms Heard along with Elon Musk – would not testify during the trial. The New-York based clinical and forensic psychologist also claimed in court that Mr Depp was insecure of “almost every person” with whom Ms Heard was in a film. “There would be those barrages of the consistent accusations of infidelity,” Dr Hughes told jurors, adding, “Billy Bob [Thornton] was one person he continued to berate her about having an affair with”. Dr Hughes said she had diagnosed Ms Heard with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the alleged intimate partner violence perpetrated by Mr Depp. She claimed Ms Heard reported Mr Depp had “pushed”, “shoved”, “slapped”, and “choked” her. She also claimed that he “slammed her into a wall” and kicked her. The psychologist said Ms Heard claimed to suffer from bruises, cuts and “vaginal pain” stemming from sexual assaults. The testimony goes against statements made by psychologist Dr Shannon Curry, who was called by Mr Depp’s team and testified earlier in the trial, that Ms Heard has “histrionic and borderline personality disorders” and “grossly exaggerated symptoms of PTSD”. Dr Hughes also dismissed the claim that the couple was responsible for “mutual abuse”, as testified by their marriage counsellor earlier in the trial. In her 2018 op-ed, Ms Heard wrote, “like many women, I had been harassed and sexually assaulted by the time I was of college age. But I kept quiet — I did not expect filing complaints to bring justice. And I didn’t see myself as a victim”. “Then two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture’s wrath for women who speak out,” she added at the time. While Mr Depp isn’t named in the piece, his legal team argues that it contains a “clear implication that Mr Depp is a domestic abuser”, which they say is “categorically and demonstrably false”. Mr Depp is seeking damages of “not less than $50m”. Ms Heard has filed a $100m counterclaim against Mr Depp for nuisance and immunity from his allegations.

5/4/2022,"The Fermi paradox questions why aliens have never visited Earth despite the Universe being so old and so vast that races should have evolved interstellar travel and come calling by now. Now two scientists believe they may have the answer. Astrobiologists Dr Michael Wong, of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, and Dr Stuart Bartlett, of California Institute of Technology, have hypothesised that civilisations burn out when they grow too large and technical. Faced with an ever-growing population and eye-watering energy consumption, worlds hit a crisis point known as a ""singularity"" where innovation can no longer keep up with demand. The only alternative to collapse is to abandon ""unyielding growth"" and adopt a balance that allows survival but prevents the society moving any further forward, or venturing far from its own spot in the universe. Writing in the Royal Society Open Science, Dr Wong and Dr Bartlett said: “We propose a new resolution to the Fermi paradox: civilisations either collapse from burnout or redirect themselves to prioritising homeostasis, a state where cosmic expansion is no longer a goal, making them difficult to detect remotely. “Either outcome — homeostatic awakening or civilisation collapse — would be consistent with the observed absence of (galactic-wide) civilisations.” The pair argue that the general principles of life are universal and that although the emergence and evolution of life on other planets remains speculative, it may be inevitable. Once on the path, life is likely to follow a similar trajectory to the civilisations of Earth, they claim, eventually organising into a globally connected state, with technology that needs increasing amounts of energy to maintain growth. Using city growth equations, which sets limits on how far societies can scale up, the experts show how large civilisations eventually hit crisis points, which, once recognised, causes a halt in further growth. The pair point to similar ‘mini-awakenings’ on Earth which have prevented global crises, such as the de-escalation of weapons of mass destruction since the Cold War, and the ban on Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to mend the hole in the ozone layer. However alien civilisations which are close to burnout may be the most easy to detect, according to the research, because they would be using energy in a ‘wildly sustainable manner’ which would provide a good signal emanating from their world. “This presents the possibility that a good many of humanity’s initial detections of extraterrestrial life may be of the intelligent, though not yet wise, kind,” they conclude. Previous suggestions for why intelligent aliens have not already visited Earth, include the discovery of a physical difficulty which makes space travel infeasible, whether related to astronomy, biology or engineering. Some scientists have suggested that aliens have simply never chosen to visit us, or if they have we have not noticed, perhaps arriving before humans had evolved. It is also possible that advanced civilisations arose too recently, and too far away, for aliens to have reached us yet. In 2015, scientists analysing data from the Hubble and Kepler space telescopes concluded that around 92 per cent of potentially habitable worlds did not exist when Earth formed, so it may be that our Solar System is simply ahead of the game.",Science/The Telegraph,"There's a reason why aliens haven’t visited Earth yet, say scientists",https://news.yahoo.com/revealed-why-aliens-haven-t-175238797.html
5/4/2022,"A Russian propagandist showed a simulation of how the UK might meet its end in a nuclear strike. ""Just one launch, Boris, and England is gone ... Why play with us?"" he said on a state broadcast. The simulation involved a nuclear attack being delivered either by air or sea. A Russian propagandist has presented on state TV a simulation of a hypothetical nuclear strike that would wipe out the UK and Ireland. Dmitry Kiselyov, a propaganda figure allied with Russian President Vladimir Putin, was seen in a May 1 broadcast of ""News of the World"" show narrating how the UK might be destroyed by a nuclear strike delivered either by air or sea. ""Just one launch, Boris, and England is gone,"" Kiselyov said over a computer-generated simulation, referring to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ""Once and for all. Why play with us?"" ""It actually seems like they're raving on the British Isles. Why threaten never-ending Russia with nuclear weapons when you're on an island, which, you know, is so small?"" Kiselyov said. He added that ""just one Sarmat missile"" would be ""sufficient to sink it once and for all."" Another way to ""put England onto the seabed"" would be to use Russia's ""Poseidon"" underwater drone, Kiselyov noted. ""It approaches the target at a one-kilometer depth at 200 kilometers per hour. There is no way to stop this underwater drone. The warhead on it is up to 100 megatons,"" he claimed. Kiselyov then posited that the ""explosion of this thermonuclear torpedo"" off the UK's coast would raise a tsunami up to 500 meters high. ""Such a water squall is also a carrier of extreme doses of radiation,"" he said. At the same time, the simulation showed a green ""wave"" representing radioactive material washing over a map of the UK and Ireland. ""Having passed over the British Isles, it will turn what may be left of them into a radioactive desert, unfit for anything for a long time,"" Kiselyov said. John Everard, the UK's former ambassador to Belarus, told RTE that he did not believe Russia had a weapon that could wipe out the UK and Ireland, per the graphic on Russian TV. ""I would urge everybody just to keep calm. By all means, if you feel strongly about it, make your things clear to the Russians. But can we please remember this is just a television mock-up,"" Everard said, per the outlet. ""The Russians do not have this weapon. I'll say that again, they do not have this weapon,"" he added, per RTE. Johnson met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv in April and promised the UK would send armored vehicles and anti-ship missiles to aid it in its fight against the Russians. In the same month, Johnson also said that some Ukrainian troops are being trained in the UK to use those armored vehicles. Last week, Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said the possibility of nuclear conflict breaking out due to the war in Ukraine was ""serious"" and ""real.""  In 2018, Putin also threatened to unleash nuclear weapons if the country were attacked.

5/4/2022,"Despite its recent pullback, bitcoin has soared by more than 2,000% over the past five years. But while the world’s largest crypto coin has clearly hit the mainstream, one prominent investor remains critical of the opportunity: Warren Buffett. At the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting on Saturday, Buffett said that while he doesn’t know whether bitcoin will go up or down going forward, he’s pretty sure that “it doesn't produce anything.” And that’s why the Oracle of Omaha doesn’t own the asset. “If you told me you own all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn’t take it because what would I do with it?” he asks. “I’d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn’t going to do anything.” To put that in perspective, bitcoin currently trades at over $38,000 a piece. While criticizing bitcoin, Buffett touched on two assets that he would buy if given the opportunity. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Agriculture and bitcoin don’t have much in common. Bitcoin was created in 2009 while agricultural communities began to form about 10,000 years ago. Buffett isn’t known for being an agricultural investor, but he sees value in an asset class that’s critical to the sector — farmland. His point is if you buy farmland, you hold a tangible asset that produces food. “If you said, for a 1% interest in all the farmland in the United States, pay our group $25 billion, I’ll write you a check this afternoon,” Buffett says. Of course, you don’t need to have $25 billion to invest in U.S. farmland. Publicly traded real estate investment trusts — that specialize in owning farms — allow you to do it with as little money as you’re willing to spend. Gladstone Land (LAND), for instance, owns 164 farms totaling 113,000 acres. It pays monthly distributions of $0.0454 per share, giving the stock an annual dividend yield of 1.5%. Then there’s Farmland Partners (FPI), a REIT with a farmland portfolio of 186,000 acres and an annual dividend yield of 1.4%. Plus, online crowdfunding platforms allow you to buy pieces of real estate, including farmland. With inflation running hot, the prices of agricultural commodities including corn and soybeans are soaring to new highs. Apartment buildings are another asset that Buffett wouldn’t mind owning at the right price. “[If] you offer me 1% of all the apartment houses in the country and you want another $25 billion, I’ll write you a check. It’s very simple,” the legendary investor says. Whether the economy is booming or in a recession, people need a place to live. And with real estate prices rising to unaffordable levels in many parts of the country, renting has become the only option for many people. You can always buy an apartment building yourself, find tenants and collect the monthly rent checks. Of course, apartment-focused REITs can do that for you. For instance, Camden Property Trust (CPT) owns, manages, develops and acquires multifamily apartment communities. It has investments in 170 properties containing 58,055 apartment units across the U.S. and offers an annual dividend yield of 2.5%. Essex Property Trust (ESS) invests in apartments primarily on the West Coast. The REIT currently yields 2.8%, backed by its ownership interest in 253 apartment communities — in California and Seattle — totaling approximately 62,000 units. Buffett prefers farmland and apartment buildings to bitcoin for a very simple reason: They produce something. “The apartments are going to produce rent, and the farms are going to produce food.” Bitcoin boasts exciting long-term upside potential. But for risk-averse investors who’d like to sidestep as much volatility as possible, sticking to productive assets is a prudent idea.

5/4/2022,"TULSA, Okla. (AP) — A bronze statue depicting one of Oklahoma's most famous Native American ballerinas was cut from its base outside a Tulsa museum and sold for scrap to a recycling company, authorities said Monday. Museum officials say the Five Moons statue of Marjorie Tallchief was likely removed Thursday from its plinth outside the Tulsa Historical Society, the Tulsa World reported. Museum officials received a call Monday from CMC Recycling in southwest Rogers County to identify what was believed to be pieces of the bronze statue, the newspaper reported. Michelle Place, director of the Tulsa Historical Society and Museum, checked out the recovered pieces late Monday morning and verified that they came from the statue. “The Tulsa Police Department is working diligently to apprehend the thief,” the historical society said in a statement. Pieces of the statute, including the head and part of an arm, are still missing. Place said the original mold for the statue burned in a foundry fire, so recreating the statute will be much more complicated. “I am devastated by this,” she said. The statues known as the Five Moons were created by Tulsa-area artists Monte England and Gary Henson. England worked on two of the pieces before his death in 2005, and Henson completed the project. The other Five Moons statues of renowned American Indian ballerinas depict Yvonne Chouteau, Rosella Hightower, Moscelyne Larkin and Maria Tallchief, Marjorie Tallchief's sister.",U.S./Associated Press,"Ballerina statue cut down in Tulsa, sold for scrap metal",https://news.yahoo.com/ballerina-statue-cut-down-tulsa-210112625.html
