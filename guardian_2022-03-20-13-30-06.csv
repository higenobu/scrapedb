3/20/2022,"Australia has banned the sale of alumina and aluminium ores to Russia in response to what it described as “unrelenting and illegal aggression” towards Ukraine. Also on Sunday, prime minister Scott Morrison announced Australia would donate coal and further military equipment to Ukraine to “support the brave and courageous resistance” as part of a new aid package that also includes $30m in emergency humanitarian assistance. “Russia must pay a very high price for its brutality. It must pay that price economically, it must pay the price ... in diplomatic terms as well,” Morrison said. It came as foreign minister Marise Payne described Russia’s atrocities in Ukraine as “war crimes” and said “innocent civilians and civilian infrastructure” were being targeted. The federal government has been under pressure to stop the export of alumina to Russia, with critics warning it was potentially allowing Australian resources to be used in munitions manufacturing. The government overnight announced it was ceasing all exports of alumina and aluminum ores, including bauxite, to limit Russia’s ability to produce aluminium, a major Russian export and a critical component in arms and munitions. Russia relies on Australia for 20% of its alumina needs. The government said it would work with “exporters and peak bodies that will be affected by the ban to find new [markets] and expand existing markets”. The sanctions are likely to impact Queensland Alumina Ltd (QAL), majority owned by Rio Tinto in a joint venture with Russia’s Rusal International, the second biggest aluminium producer in the world. Rio Tinto has been approached for comment. QAL was affected by sanctions announced last week, which targeted two Russian businessmen, Viktor Vekselberg and Oleg Deripaska. A company founded by Deripaska owns 20% of the QAL, which is a major employer in Gladstone. After the sanctions on Deripaska, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, an advocacy organisation, called for a complete ban on Rusal exporting Australian alumina to Russia. On Sunday, the centre’s climate and environment director, Dan Gocher, said the ban addressed the concern over Australian alumina being used in Russian arms manufacturing. “The secondary concern is that Deripaska and Vekselberg still stand to profit from Queensland Alumina,” he said. “If the government doesn’t sanction Rusal, then Rio Tinto must ensure any profits are quarantined.” Rusal said in a statement that Deripaska had surrendered his majoirty interest and control over Rusal and its parent company, En+, after an agreement with the US Treasury following sanctions in 2019. “Pursuant to the agreement with the US Treasury, which removed Mr Deripaska from control of the business, and which remains effective and ongoing, Mr Deripaska cannot receive any type of financial benefit from his minority holding in EN+, RUSAL or any part of the Group and is completely blocked from receiving dividends.” Rusal said Vekselberg was indirectly a minority beneficiary and has no influence on the company’s operations. The Australian government also announced a new major aid and assistance package to Ukraine. The package included a donation of 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal to assist Ukraine with energy security. The coal will be sourced from Whitehaven Coal, which has arranged the shipment. Australia is working with Ukraine and Poland to deliver the supplies. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The assistance will help keep the country’s coal-fired power generators operating and supplying electricity to the country’s power grid, supporting the Ukrainian people by keeping lights on, homes heated and factories running at this very difficult time,” the government said in a statement. The aid package also includes $30m in additional emergency humanitarian assistance and a new humanitarian visa, which will be temporarily available to Ukrainians fleeing the war. The visa allows work, study and access to Medicare for three years. “Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, the Morrison government has issued almost 4,500 visas to Ukrainians,” the government said. “Over 600 Ukrainians with these visas have arrived and more are coming every day.” Donations to approved charities and not-for-profits supporting Ukrainian refugees will be made tax deductible and Australia will give $10m to the World Food Program to help address food shortages. The measures were welcomed by the Australian Council for International Development, a peak group for the aid sector, who described the intervention as “critical for the Ukrainian people in their hour of need”. “This new funding will protect women, children, people with disabilities and the elderly as they flee the violence and destruction,” chief executive Marc Purcell said. Australia has also boosted its military assistance to Ukraine by $21m, taking the total military funding to $91m. The new assistance will include “additional material from Australian Defence Force stocks”.",News/Australia news,Australia bans exports of aluminium ores to Russia over ‘illegal’ aggression towards Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/20/australia-bans-exports-of-aluminium-ores-to-russia-over-aggression-towards-ukraine
3/20/2022,"Residents of Mariupol have been taken to Russia, where they have been “redirected” to remote cities in the country, the Mariupol city council has reported. The council said that “several thousand Mariupol residents were deported to Russia”, having been taken to “filtration camps, where occupiers checked people’s phones and documents”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Switzerland to crack down on Russian oligarchs who he said are helping to wage war on Ukraine from the safety of “beautiful Swiss towns”. “Your banks are where the money of the people who unleashed this war lies. That is painful,” he said, addressing an anti-war protest in Bern. Poland has proposed for the European Union to implement a total ban on trade with Russia, prime minister Mateus Morawiecki has said. “Poland is proposing to add a trade blockade to this package of sanctions as soon as possible, (including) both of its seaports ... but also a ban on land trade. The southern city of Zaporizhzhia entered a 38-hour curfew beginning at 4pm local time on Saturday after the Ukrainian military ordered people to stay home until early on Monday. The city has become an important route for some of the 35,000 people estimated to have escaped the siege of Mariupol. Aid agencies are being prevented from reaching people trapped in Ukrainian cities surrounded by Russian forces, the World Food Programme said. It has warned that Ukraine’s food supply chains are breaking down, with many grocery stores and warehouses now empty. Russia said it had used hypersonic weapons, which travel fast enough to evade detection by missile defence systems, to destroy an underground military depot in western Ukraine. Its defence ministry said on Saturday it hit the depot for missiles and aircraft ammunition in the Ivano-Fehrankivsk region, the Interfax news agency reported. The ministry said it had also destroyed Ukrainian military radio and reconnaissance centres near the port city of Odesa using a coastal missile system, according to Interfax. Ten humanitarian corridors were agreed with Russia for the evacuation of citizens, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said. Reuters reports that Vereshchuk said a corridor had been agreed for the besieged city of Mariupol, although the authorities’ previous efforts to evacuate civilians there under a temporary ceasefire have mostly failed Kyiv officials have reported that 228 people, including four children, have been killed in the capital. Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs reported that 14,400 Russian personnel have been killed since the start of the war. Boris Johnson has come under heavy criticism for comparing the struggle of Ukrainians fighting to the British public voting for Brexit. In his speech to the Conservative spring conference in Blackpool, Johnson said it is the “instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom”, with the Brexit vote a “famous recent example”. The comparison was condemned by Tory peer Lord Barwell, who pointed out Ukraine is seeking to join the EU. Zelenskiy called for “meaningful, fair” peace talks to take place urgently. Ukraine’s president told Moscow that Russian losses would otherwise be so huge it would take generations to recover. “Negotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine – meaningful, fair and without delay – are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes,” he said. Ukraine may not produce enough crops to export if this year’s sowing season is disrupted by Russia’s invasion, the presidential adviser Oleh Ustenko has said. “Ukraine has enough grain and food reserves to survive for a year, but if the war continues ... [Ukraine] will not be able to export grain to the world, and there will be problems,” he said, adding that Ukraine is the world’s fifth-largest wheat exporter.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 25 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-25-of-the-invasion
3/20/2022,"A brilliant strike from Ismaël Bennacer earned Milan a 1-0 victory at Cagliari on as Stefano Pioli’s side maintained their three-point lead at the top of Serie A. Second-placed Napoli’s comeback victory over Udinese earlier on Saturday put the pressure on Milan to respond, and they endured a frustrating first half in Sardinia, wasting several chances to break the deadlock. It took the visitors until the 59th minute to find what proved to be the winner, and it was worth the wait as Olivier Giroud laid the ball off for the Algeria international Bennacer to volley into the net from the edge of the penalty area. Milan, who are chasing their first Serie A title since 2011, survived a major scare late on as Leonardo Pavoletti’s last-gasp header came off the crossbar. “We aren’t used to just managing matches,” Pioli told Sky Sport Italia. “We are usually scoring more goals but the team did well today even when they had to grit their teeth. We are doing very well but we know that there are four teams that can win the Scudetto. Now comes the [international] break and we will have to work well to be ready for the return to action.” Internazionale dropped more points when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Fiorentina at San Siro. The game was goalless at half-time, with Inter’s Samir Handanovic called into action to stop long-range efforts. Fiorentina’s Pietro Terracciano denied Edin Dzeko from close range before Lautaro Martínez’s strike was disallowed for offside. The visitors’ sustained pressure paid off early in the second half when Gaetano Castrovilli cut open Inter’s defence. His pass found Nicolás González, in the penalty area, and the forward’s quick cutback was fired in by Lucas Torreira. Simone Inzaghi’s side levelled within five minutes, with Ivan Perisic floating a cross into the box for fellow wing-back Denzel Dumfries to head home. Fiorentina almost grabbed a late winner, Handanovic denying Jonathan Ikone on the break – but the draw means Inter have won only one of their last seven league games. Napoli are three points clear of Inter in second place after fighting back to beat Udinese 2-1 at home. Luciano Spalletti’s side fell behind in the 22nd minute after Gerard Deulofeu arrowed a strike into the net, but Victor Osimhen headed Napoli level seven minutes after the restart, then added the second with a near-post finish. A second double in a week for the Nigerian striker was enough to secure back-to-back wins for Napoli, while Pablo Marí’s late red card ended the visitors’ hope of finding an equaliser. A fine finish from midfielder Koke was enough to earn Atlético Madrid a 1-0 win at Rayo Vallecano to keep their faint La Liga title hopes alive. Antoine Griezmann wasted several chances to break the deadlock for the visitors in the first half, with the Frenchman’s finishing deserting him on numerous occasions. The only goal came four minutes into the second period when a perfect pass from João Félix picked out Koke, who swept the ball into the bottom corner with precision. Griezmann then missed another glorious opportunity, before Jan Oblak kept out the home side’s best effort at goal from Mario Suárez. The only dampener on a fifth successive win in all competitions for Diego Simeone’s side was the dismissal late on of Ángel Correa, who was shown a straight red card for something he appeared to have said to the referee. In the Bundesliga, Bayern Munich got their title bid back on track with a dominant 4-0 home win over Union Berlin. Robert Lewandowski scored either side of half-time as Bayern moved seven points clear of Borussia Dortmund, who play Cologne on Sunday. Bayern had drawn their last two league fixtures, against Hoffenheim and Leverkusen, but never looked in danger after taking an early lead. With 16 minutes on the clock, Kingsley Coman’s shot from outside the box caught out Union keeper Andreas Luthe. Centre-back Tanguy Nianzou powered in a header in the 25th minute, before Lewandowski converted a penalty on the stroke of half-time after being brought down by Luthe. The Poland forward struck again two minutes after the restart, converting Jamal Musiala’s cross to take his league tally to 31 goals this season. Hertha Berlin climbed out of the bottom two and ended a nine-game winless run with a 3-0 victory over Hoffenheim, despite their new head coach, Felix Magath, missing the match due to a Covid-19 infection. It was left to Magath’s assistant, Mark Fotheringham, to lead the team and the Scot oversaw a dominant win, with Marvin Plattenhardt’s set pieces creating all three goals. Niklas Stark, Ishak Belfodil and Lucas Tousart all scored as Hertha climbed above Arminia Bielefeld, who were beaten 4-0 at mid-table Mainz. Stuttgart also boosted their hopes of beating the drop with a 3-2 home win over fellow strugglers Augsburg. The hosts had to come from behind twice but sealed a dramatic victory when Tiago Tomás fired into the roof of the net with five minutes to go. Elsewhere, Freiburg edged back into the top four with a goalless draw at the bottom club, Greuther Fürth.",Sport/Football,European roundup: Milan capitalise on Inter’s slip up while Atlético win again,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/european-roundup-inter-milan-fiorentina-bayern-munich-napoli-atletico-madrid
3/20/2022,"It seems hard to credit, but in the days before the likes of Vladimir Putin and P&O Ferries showed their true colours, Uber was regarded by many in London as one of the more suspect foreign arrivals. This week, however, the global ride-hailing firm will once again find out if it is on the naughty step, when its licence to operate in one of its biggest markets comes up for renewal. Its first private hire licence, along with thousands more for its drivers, came without too much fuss in 2012 from Transport for London, who were keen to embrace the latest technology in everything from tickets to traffic lights – even as the traditional London cabby cried foul at the new US cock of the walk. Renewing that licence has been a different matter. Uber will be hoping this will be the third time lucky, after being knocked back twice in the space of two years and having to suffer the indignity of pleading to a magistrate for a conditional extension. Are they now, in the parlance, “fit and proper”? Few would want to prejudge TfL, whose reasons for turning down Uber in 2017 and 2019 had largely flown under the radar. Beforehand, opponents from the taxi trade had focused on being undercut by lost Prius drivers unable to do a three-point turn, while socially aware campaigners cried foul at Uber’s payment and “partner” arrangements. Instead, safety and security problems came to the fore. TfL cited Uber’s failure to report alleged offences to the police in 2017. Then, after beefing up reporting protocols, in 2019 Uber was slapped down because drivers had worked under fake identities. Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi had just come in as the new broom after alarming claims of boardroom harassment did for founder Travis Kalanick in 2017. Khosrowshahi flew in to promise mayor Sadiq Khan that the firm would change. If the first instance was a pivotal moment in what might be called new Uber, the repeat treatment provoked some indignation in the San Francisco global HQ. In 2019, Khosrowshahi simply tweeted that TfL’s decision was “just wrong”, after “fundamental change”. Both times, Uber remained able to operate pending appeals, and no doubt will again should the licence due to expire on 27 March not be renewed. But it will remain an important corporate verdict – particularly given the wider overtones from Sadiq Khan that Uber had not been “playing by the rules”. And Uber’s boss for UK and northern Europe, a cycling north Londoner, Jamie Heywood, might feel particularly aggrieved, after introducing schemes to push the uptake of electric vehicles in the capital, and winning the support of the GMB union after concessions on holiday pay for drivers. Uber has backed Khan’s plans to expand the ultra-low emission zone and tried to marry up consumer desire for electric cabs with the reality of drivers – now finally described as its workforce, rather than partners – who typically live in flats in east London without the kind of charging infrastructure more swiftly installed in the Tesla-owning boroughs. With rivals such as Bolt now competing directly for passengers and drivers with virtually identical apps, Uber has been the first to change its business model – admittedly, under legal direction – to finally acknowledge that the passenger is booking direct with Uber rather than the driver. That has tax implications – pushing up fares in the UK, at a time when many customers may already be feeling the pinch. According to TfL, the VAT now payable on cab fares is a matter for HMRC and has no bearing on the licence. But Uber is, at least, quickly complying with a condition that will now apply to all. With revenues globally averaging nearly $2bn a month, and offshoots such as food delivery via Uber Eats growing profitable, London and its 50,000 Uber drivers may not be a pivotal part of the business. But global reputation still counts for something – and an undisputed licence would go some way to wipe the tarnish from the Uber brand.",News/Technology,Uber hopes for an easier ride with its new London licence,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/20/uber-hopes-for-an-easier-ride-with-its-new-london-licence
3/20/2022,"Coronavirus booster vaccine jabs for millions of people in England will begin to be offered this week, the NHS announced. The vaccine will be available to care home residents, people who are 75 and over, and the immunosuppressed aged 12 and over. About 5 million people are expected to be given the jab, with 600,000 invited to book their dose this week. The booster announcement came as the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed a resurgence of Covid cases is under way across the UK, with infections in the over-70s at a record high and school leaders fearing that preparations for A-levels and GCSEs are being disrupted by outbreaks among staff and students. Based on random swab testing, the ONS estimates almost 5% of the population in England, or 1,544,600 people, had Covid in the week ending 12 March, and 3.5% of people in the oldest age group. Infections also reached a record high in Scotland, where one in 14 tested positive. Sarah Crofts, at the ONS Infection Survey, said: “These latest figures show further increases in infections across most of the UK with high levels of infection everywhere. It’s notable also that infections have risen in all age groups, with the over-70s reaching their highest estimate since our survey began.” Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said: “Following the massive success of the rollout so far, we are now offering over-75s and the most vulnerable a spring booster dose to top up their protection against this virus.” The NHS Covid-19 vaccination programme will contact people when it is their turn to be vaccinated again and, once they have an invitation, they will be able to book their appointment through the National Booking System either online or by calling NHS 119. Local NHS teams will also be administering the jab in care homes. Last week, the seven-day average for UK hospital admissions related to Covid rose above 1,700, with more than half being admitted directly because of Covid, the NHS Confederation said. NHS staff absences have begun to rise again, while emergency departments are also under pressure. NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said: “The NHS Covid-19 vaccination programme has not stopped in its efforts to protect people from coronavirus – around 5 million of the most vulnerable people will be eligible for a spring dose and from tomorrow, we will start giving eligible groups their additional top-up in protection. “We have protected millions of people at speed thanks to the efforts of our staff, aided by volunteers. They will once again rise to the next challenge.”",News/World news,5m people in England to be offered Covid booster jabs ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/5m-people-in-england-to-be-offered-covid-booster-jabs

3/20/2022,"You could measure the gap between England and France by the 12 points difference on the scoreboard. Or you could measure it by the inches between Ben Youngs’ outstretched hand and Antoine Dupont’s shorts as Youngs launched himself headfirst into a futile dive after the best player in the world and tried to drag him back as he cut England apart. You could measure it in the feet England were shoved backwards at the scrum just before half-time where they conceded yet another set-piece penalty, or you could measure it by the acres of space France found out on the right wing when they created the three-on-one overlap that led to their first try. The answer’s the same either way: a lot, and more than England’s coach, Eddie Jones, is letting on. Really, the best way to capture the distance between them might be in years. France have been building towards this grand slam ever since the last World Cup, when their current coach, Fabien Galthié, was already in place, deputy and heir apparent, to his predecessor, Jacques Brunel. In the years since, Galthié and his boss, Bernard Laporte, have turned France’s run at the World Cup they host next year into a national project. They haven’t just put together a team of coaches and a squad of players, but they have pulled in the Top 14 clubs and the French fans, too. There’s a sense that everyone’s pulling in the same direction. So Galthié’s team have been three years in the making. Jones’s, on the other hand, feels like they have barely had three weeks. Somehow they are still starting out all over. That’s Jones’s choice, as he chops and drops and changes his backroom staff, his training squad and his match-day 23, while he tries to work out exactly what “new England” looks like. He keeps talking about how they are steps forward, but it’s beginning to feel as if they are standing still. He was at it again on Saturday night. “We’re moving in the right direction,” Jones said, “we’re not far away.” They are. In the first half, in particular, England were out of their depth. They showed plenty of heart, but they weren’t strong enough to break France open, weren’t fast enough to stretch them apart, weren’t slick enough to outsmart them, or disciplined enough to shut them down and stop them scoring. For all their effort, they didn’t once make it into the French 22 in those first 40 minutes and were fortunate that they were only 18-6 down at the break. Their play all felt over-engineered, dependent on training-ground ploys such as having Ellis Genge truck the ball up from deep, or Marcus Smith kick it crossfield. It was as if they were playing to a formula they had concocted during the week and decided to stick with it even though it wasn’t working for them. And the trouble was, in the time it took them to change it up, France had all but gone and won the game. They’ve never once been behind at half-time in any of 26 Tests they’ve played since Galthié became head coach. And England’s best chance of beating them here depended on changing that by getting ahead and putting them under a kind of pressure they had never experienced before. Instead, England worked hard and went nowhere, while making sloppy mistakes, and giving away penalties. In the second half, presumably after Jones and his fellow coaches had intervened, England did change the way they were playing. Smith, who played the first half as if he was doing his best impression of Owen Farrell, finally started to do the things that got him picked in the first place, like run and pass. And there was a moment there when it did all click: Joe Marchant made a fine break off a lineout and, after he was caught by the shorts, Smith stepped up, worked an intricate little loop with Jamie George, fed the ball on to Elliot Daly, who sent it on again to Freddie Steward, who scored in the corner. Here at last was a vision of an England who could compete with the best team in the world. Steward, who had his best game yet, launched another attack with a superb catch off his own garryowen, Henry Slade was up at first receiver, spitting fast flat passes, and then the moment went again, while Smith tucked in behind him. For those 15 minutes, England played with the intensity and verve they needed to display for the whole 80 if they were going to win this match. If Jones is right, and they really are moving forwards, England will be back here in 20 months or so, when, according to his plan, they will be playing in the World Cup semi-finals, maybe against this same French team. It sounds a long time now, but it only adds up to a handful of games, three in the summer on tour in Australia, three more in the autumn, and another run at the Six Nations, then they are into the warm-ups. Eleven games then, just under 15 hours of match time. It’s not long to make up that gap, however you measure it.",Sport/Sport,Jones’s claims of England’s progress ring hollow as France highlight gulf in class | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/19/eddiejones-six-nations-claims-of-englands-progress-ring-hollow-as-france-highlight-gulf-in-class
3/20/2022,"Eddie Jones refused to address his future as England’s head coach but conceded he had “not done a good enough job” after his side ended another disappointing Six Nations campaign with a comprehensive defeat by France. England were outscored three tries to one as France wrapped up their first title in 12 years and a grand slam to boot, leaving Jones’s side with just two wins and three defeats from the tournament for the second year in a row. Results earlier in the day ensured England finish the championship in third place in the table – an improvement on last year’s fifth-place finish – but with only three tries scored, the victory over Italy notwithstanding, Jones has come under increasing criticism as the Six Nations has worn on and questions continue to be raised over his suitability for the job. After last year’s tournament the Rugby Football Union conducted a review into England’s performance before giving Jones its backing to continue and, with less than 18 months until the start of the 2023 World Cup, similar introspection is required at Twickenham. Asked whether he was still the best person to coach England he said: “That is not a question I need to answer. I just do my job, it is a question for other people to answer. I am not even thinking about that.” He added: “I’m disappointed, disappointed for the fans, for the players, I obviously haven’t done a good enough job, I accept that, but we’re moving in the right direction. The results aren’t good enough. When you rebuild a team it takes time. “France are deserved champions of the Six Nations, they are the best team, but we had enough chances to win that game, we just didn’t put them away, we were not quite clinical enough in doing that. That has been a little bit of the story of us in the Six Nations, we have put ourselves in position to win the three games we have lost but not been clinical enough, not been good enough, particularly in some of our clean out work to win those games. So that is disappointing but the spirit we showed is going to make sure this team keeps moving in the right direction.” France were nervous in patches against Jones’s side, who did rally to 18-13 early in the second half after Freddie Steward’s score before Antoine Dupont’s try effectively settled the contest. If it was not a vintage French performance, the gulf between the two sides was evident. “It is a great benchmark game for us,” added Jones. “We are not far away but we are far away and the effort it takes to bridge that gap is important. We have got a lot of good young players coming through and some of the older guys are starting to play some really good rugby again so we are going to have a good blend going through to the World Cup.” Gaël Fickou scored France’s first try, rounding off a period of prolonged French pressure before François Cros added the second on the stroke of half-time. Jones highlighted that score – and the moment when England replacement Alex Dombrandt was held up over the tryline in the second half – as key moments. “There were a couple of really big moments in the game,” said Jones. “The try before half-time gave France a bit of breathing space and then we had Dombrandt held over the line. We get that and at that stage we are making the running in the game and that would have put a lot of additional pressure on France with thoughts of the grand slam.”",Sport/Sport,Eddie Jones admits ‘results aren’t good enough’ as England lick wounds,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/eddie-jones-admits-results-arent-good-enough-as-england-lick-wounds
3/20/2022,"Government ministers knew about P&O Ferries’ plan to slash 800 jobs before staff were informed but were told by officials it would ensure the firm remained “a key player in the UK market for years to come”, it was claimed on Saturday. A leaked memo, apparently written by a senior Whitehall official, justified the mass redundancies, stating that “without these decisions, an estimated 2,200 staff would likely lose their jobs”. The memo, said to have been written before ferry staff were told their jobs were being lost last Thursday, said the redundancies “will align them [P&O] with other companies in the market who have undertaken a large reduction in staff previously”. The memo was “widely shared across government”, including copies to the prime minister’s private office while the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, is understood to have received a copy, the Sunday Times reported. Louise Haigh, Labour’s shadow transport secretary, said: “This proves the government was not only aware of P&O ferries’ scandalous action but complicit in it. “They knew people’s livelihoods were on the line and they knew P&O was attempting to use exploitative fire and rehire practices. But they sat back and did nothing. The shambolic response to this shameful episode proves the Conservatives cannot and will not stand up for British workers.” A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “This was an internal government memo which, as standard practice, outlined what officials had been told by P&O Ferries shortly before their announcement was made. This was sent before ministers were advised of the full details. As soon as they were informed, they made clear their outrage at the way in which P&O staff had been dismissed.” P&O Ferries has been accused of wanting to exploit a loophole in minimum wage laws to draft in cheap foreign workers for its vessels. The company has previously faced allegations of hiring crew for as little as £1.83 an hour, because the national minimum wage laws do not apply on international sea routes. Union officials say P&O may be able to cut its wage bill by up to half. MPs are furious at the mass sackings via online video by a firm that has relied on more than £10m of taxpayers’ support to pay staff wages during the pandemic. Ministers face urgent calls to review the operations of its Dubai-based owner DP World, which also operates ports at London Gateway and Southampton. Karl Turner, the Labour MP for Hull East, said: “They can now bring in cheaper crews because the national minimum wage laws do not apply. It is an outrage, and the government needs to urgently close this loophole.” P&O’s ferry fleet was ordered to dock on Thursday and staff were told it was their final day of employment. The company said it had made a £100m loss in a year, and “swift and significant” changes were needed. P&O suspended services on routes between Dover and Calais, Larne in Northern Ireland and Cairnryan in Scotland, Dublin and Liverpool, and Hull and Rotterdam. New crews are already in place, and P&O’s Liverpool-Dublin crossings resumed on Saturday afternoon. DP World paid £322m for P&O Ferries in February 2019. The chairman and group chief executive is Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, and it is ultimately owned by Dubai’s ruling royal family. In May 2020, the firm announced up to 1,100 redundancies, the majority of which were crew in Hull and Dover. Unions warned MPs they were concerned about a long-term plan to replace UK-based crews with “low-cost foreign crews”.

3/20/2022,"Firefighters have been dealing with a suspected deliberately started fire on marshland on the Wirral. Fire engines were scrambled to the scene where about 500 sq metres of marsh were in flames at Parkgate, 10km from Liverpool city centre, at about 6.20pm on Saturday. Cheshire fire and rescue service said six fire engines were on site with firefighters initially battling two areas of flames with beaters and hoses. However, at about 9.20pm it said one fire engine had withdrawn and crews were leaving the fire to burn due to unstable ground. The fire service said crews are expected to remain at the scene of the blaze on Neston marsh until about 2am. Fire breaks are being maintained to protect properties and people are asked to stay away from the area while the blaze is being dealt with. The fire service added that police have been advised it is suspected that the blaze was started deliberately and a fire investigator is due to attend. Carl Nevitt, a station manager and the officer in charge of the incident, said: “The marshland is a site of special scientific interest. The fire is covering around one square kilometre of the area and is being driven by wind. “We have created fire breaks to protect properties and the police air support unit has been used to give us information on the directional spread of the blaze. “We expect to remain at the scene for at least the next three to four hours and would ask that people stay away from the area as we tackle the fire.”",News/UK news,Fire burning on Wirral marshland believed deliberately started,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/19/fire-burning-on-wirral-marshland-believed-deliberately-started
3/20/2022,"15 Melvyn Jaminet Dealt with first high ball well, knocked on the next but was not flustered. Has quickly developed into an integral member of this side. 8 14 Damian Penaud Last-ditch tackle on Marchant and showed what an elusive runner he can be in buildup to Dupont’s try. Such a tricky player. 7 13 Gaël Fickou Knock-on after France had prised open England’s defence with a lovely set play but made amends with the opening try soon after. Key turnover too. 8 12 Jonathan Danty Storming run up the middle of the park and one remarkable kick over his shoulder. Another who can be pleased with performances throughout the tournament. 7 11 Gabin Villière Lost first aerial duel with Steward but responded with turnover at the breakdown. Such impressive workrate just never stops. 8 10 Romain Ntamack Clever bouncing pass to Fickou for opening try and showed an authority that rarely wavered amid a packed-out stadium going bonkers. 7 9 Antoine Dupont (capt) Sacked Itoje, who was standing in at scrum-half. Fitting that the skipper ultimately settled a contest he marshalled so well. 9 1 Cyril Baille Such soft hands for a loosehead prop. Genge looked good in parts but Baille is setting new standards in the position. 8 2 Julien Marchand Not too many of his gallops in open field but no complaints about his set piece before Mauvaka took over. 6 3 Uini Atonio Fine performance at tighthead from a consistent performer throughout this championship. Had Genge’s number at the scrum. 8 4 Cameron Woki Enjoyed pitting his wits against Itoje at the lineout and around the field he probably edged that absorbing individual battle. 8 5 Paul Willemse Performs the role of enforcer for France. This feels like the campaign in which he has truly proved he belongs on this stage. 6 6 François Cros Delivered a telling blow just before half-time. Plays a key role in French gameplan of softening up opposing defence. 8 7 Anthony Jelonch Early knock-on but made a bullocking run down the left. Back-row is an area of immense strength for France but Jelonch has justified his coach’s faith. 7 7 Grégory Alldritt Player of the tournament by a distance. Came up with crucial turnovers, tackles, carries and key assist for Dupont’s try. 9 Replacements: Gros (for Baille, 50) Solid 6; Mohamed Haouas (for Atonio, 55) n/a; Romain Taofifénua (for Willemse, 50) Added oomph 6; Thibaud Flament (for Woki, 72) n/a; Dylan Cretin (for Cros, 72) n/a; Maxime Lucu (for Dupont, 77) n/a; Thomas Ramos (for Jaminet, 77) n/a 15 George Furbank You cannot say the gamble paid off. One lovely pass to Nowell on left wing but a brain freeze when gathering Danty’s kick with a foot in touch. 4 14 Freddie Steward Roamed off his wing and had some joy in the air against France’s back three. Finished off a much-needed try too when England were on top. 8 13 Joe Marchant One of England’s best performers. Made some ground up the middle and almost evaded Penaud’s desperate tackle for a try. 7 12 Henry Slade Kept trying to find ways to create gaps in the French defence but rarely found a way though the wall of blue. Forced things a bit too much. 6 11 Jack Nowell Escaped punishment for taking Jaminet out in the air and suffered nasty looking injury that ended his evening with his next attempt. 4 10 Marcus Smith The odd goose step and carried out his instructions when it came to hoisting the ball high. Didn’t always look on same page as those outside him. 5 9 Ben Youngs Laborious at times and struggled to get England going. Kicking was fine, France knew exactly what to expect. Eddie Jones’s scrum-half policy still feels confused. 5 1 Ellis Genge Again gave everything with countless carries in the backfield and some heroic tackling. His scrummaging suffered as a result, though. 7 2 Jamie George Not able to reproduce his heroics against Ireland but it was not for lack of effort. Luke Cowan-Dickie likely to come back into side this summer. 6 3 Will Stuart Praised by Jones for his cameo against Ireland but didn’t reach the same heights here and was withdrawn with more than 30 minutes to go. 5 4 Maro Itoje Always tends to be one of England’s most eye-catching performers and will always exert some influence. France did well to shackle him, however. 7 5 Nick Isiekwe Got the nod in front of Joe Launchbury for his lineout work and few complaints about that. Offered England little else though. 5 6 Courtney Lawes (capt) Never threw in the towel and came to the fore early in the second half as England rallied but, in truth, a comeback was never likely. 6 7 Sam Underhill Largely anonymous in the first half after recall to back row but far more involved in the third quarter, thundering into everything that moved, before he was replaced. 6 8 Sam Simmonds Almost dropped kick-off but settled thereafter. Has rarely managed to find the open spaces he craves throughout this tournament, however. 5 Replacements: Joe Marler (for Genge 65) Scrum did improve 6; Kyle Sinckler (for Stuart 49) A little off the pace 6; Ollie Chessum (for Isiekwe 63) Busy 7; Alex Dombrandt (for Underhill 65) Almost grabbed try with trademark running line 6; Harry Randall (for Youngs 65) Injected tempo 7; George Ford (for Furbank 77) n/a; Elliot Daly (for Nowell 26) Looked bright after another early introduction 6",Sport/Sport,France 25-13 England: Six Nations ratings from the Stade de France,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/france-25-13-england-six-nations-ratings-from-the-stade-de-france
3/20/2022,"P&O crossings between Liverpool and Dublin resumed on Saturday afternoon, two days after the ferry company suspended services when it sacked 800 staff and brought in replacement agency workers. Labour had called on the government to step in and halt any crossings, as ministers confirmed that all government contracts with the company were being reviewed. The Conservative party co-chair Oliver Dowden said P&O Ferries and its owner, DP World, “should be in no doubt the government is considering very closely its relationship with them”. “All of us feel, frankly, a revulsion at the kind of sharp practices from P&O. There has been a complete lack of engagement, a lack of prior notice or indeed any empathy whatsoever for the workers,” he told Times Radio. It came as the Sunday Times newspaper said it received a leaked memo apparently written by a senior Whitehall official that tried to “justify” the mass redundancies, stating that “without these decisions, an estimated 2,200 staff would likely lose their jobs”. The memo, which is claimed to have been sent before 800 P&O staff were told of their jobs being lost on Thursday, adds the changes “will align them with other companies in the market who have undertaken a large reduction in staff previously”. The newspaper said it was “widely shared across government” and recipients included the prime minister’s private office while the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, is understood to have received a copy. After reports the firm intended to resume the Liverpool-Dublin route with its Norbank ship on Saturday, the shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said: “P&O must not be allowed to sail today with replacement agency labour for loyal workers unjustly sacked this week. Strong words from the government are meaningless – they must step in and act.” After at least one of the company’s ferries was reported to have left Liverpool on Saturday morning, the Labour MP for Sefton Central, Bill Esterson, tweeted: “Looks like one of the P&O ships has left for Dublin. So who is the crew?” Union calls for a boycott of P&O were also backed by the Labour MP for East Hull, Karl Turner, who said he had for years been raising concerns about legal loopholes that meant the national minimum wage did not apply on international ferry routes, and called on the government to do more to punish the company for its actions. “The government should be telling every single person to boycott P&O Ferries. That should be the message because we should not be allowing a pariah business to take advantage of British workers,” he said on the BBC’s Today programme, adding they should demand back the £10m furlough money provided to the company during the pandemic. Labour has also urged the government to publish the legal advice it received on whether P&O broke the law by making so many roles redundant without consultation, and asked if ministers were able to reverse the decision. “We are demanding the prime minister grants access to the legal advice the Department for Transport received on whether P&O Ferry’s actions constitute a breach of the law, and whether there are legal levers to get the decision reversed,” said Keir Starmer. “Full transparency is vital to prevent anyone else from being subjected to this appalling behaviour.” Labour party analysis showed P&O Ferries had received £38.3m in government contracts since December 2018. In a new statement on Friday, P&O Ferries said its decision was a “last resort” after concluding “the business wouldn’t survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements”. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said he had instructed the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) to carry out inspections of all P&O vessels before they returned to sea to check the new crews the company had “rushed through” were safe. Protesters were expected to march on the Tory party conference on Saturday for another day of demonstrations against the move, after protests at ports in London, Liverpool, Larne, Hull and Dover on Friday. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “If the company has breached the law it must face severe consequences – not just a slap on the wrist. “What happened at P&O can never, ever be allowed to happen again. Ministers must urgently bring forward an employment bill to stop workers from being treated like disposable labour. The time for excuses is over.”",News/Business,P&O resumes Liverpool-Dublin service as government reviews contracts,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/19/uk-government-reviewing-its-po-ferries-contracts-after-staff-sackings
3/20/2022,"Detectives have named a man they are working to trace after the death of a young woman at her student flat in London. Police are looking for Maher Maaroufe, 22, who is known to travel and has links across London. He is also known to travel to Cambridgeshire. The Metropolitan police said anyone who sees Maaroufe should not approach him and call 999 immediately. Police were called to an accommodation block in Clerkenwell for students at City, University of London at 5.10am on Saturday after emergency services received reports of an injured woman, believed to be 19. Officers and the London ambulance service attended and found the woman suffering from serious injuries. They attempted to revive her, but she was pronounced dead at the scene at Arbour House, Sebastian Street. No arrests have been made so far and detectives from the Met’s specialist crime command are leading the investigation. DCI Linda Bradley said: “The woman’s family have been informed and will be supported by specialist officers in the days and months ahead. My thoughts and that of my team are with them at this terribly difficult time. “We believe the victim is a student who was studying at City, University of London. “Early indications so far suggest that the victim had been in a relationship with Maaroufe and that they had been together that evening. “Urgent inquiries to locate Maaroufe are ongoing and I urge him to attend a police station immediately. Anyone who has information that can help police must do the right thing and please call us now.” The front of Arbour House, a multi-storey block, was taped off and a section of nearby Goswell Road was closed to traffic. Ana, 20, an international student and resident at Arbour House, was in the building when the police arrived. “It has made me feel really uncomfortable, and reminded me that we have to take extra precautions, especially as she was a woman around my age. “Seeing the police was scary at the beginning. We heard all the banging, the police raiding rooms to investigate on the fifth floor. I don’t actually know where they found her, but they were coming into our rooms. “But now it feels a lot safer to have them around while they investigate.” A spokesperson for Unite Students, which runs Arbour House, said: “As this remains an ongoing police incident, we are unable to comment on their investigation. “Our priority at this time is the safety and wellbeing of students at Arbour House. We are working closely with the police and City, University of London.” A spokesperson for City, University of London said: “As a university, we will do everything we can to support our students and staff and we will continue to fully support the police with their investigation. We are working closely with Unite Students who own and operate Arbour House.” A postmortem examination is expected to take place in due course.

3/20/2022,"Having spent the best part of two days in the dirt watching Kraigg Brathwaite chalk up the third longest innings by a West Indian after Brian Lara’s two world records, it is over to England’s batters to see whether they can somehow advance this second Test and force an unlikely win on the final day. The tourists will resume on 40 for no loss and a lead of 136 runs, West Indies having finally been bowled out for 411 from 187.5 overs after tea in reply to 507 for nine declared. Brathwaite led the way for the hosts, not just turning his overnight 109 into 160 but also putting miles into the legs of his opponents. Brathwaite had also refreshed his own attack but inducing some late panic was never going to be easy on this surface. Though one scare followed when Zak Crawley reviewed an lbw decision on two, pinned in front by Kemar Roach only for Hawk-Eye to show it was missing leg stump by a whisker, he and Alex Lees survived 15 overs and will resume a possible charge for quick runs first thing. “Pressure can do funny things,” replied Saqib Mahmood, fresh from figures of two for 58 from 27 overs on debut, when asked if England can claim 10 wickets on day five. “I’ve got my head around putting the bowling boots back on. It’s been hard work so far but that is why we play the game.” It had been a serious slog just to get to this point, with only Lara’s scores of 375 (766 mins) in 1994 and 400 not out (778) 10 years on longer than Brathwaite’s 710-minute innings among Caribbean epics. “This was the first time my mother has watched me play,” revealed the Barbadian right-hander. “Scoring runs is always a great feeling and I’m very happy to get a hundred at home.” The soft-spoken West Indies captain prefers the road less travelled in these parts, having never played a professional game of Twenty20. His occupation is very much occupation and, after the hosts resumed on 288 for four, he ground down his opponents with a remarkable display of concentration that saw him notch up 400 dot balls out of the 489 he faced over two days. Over 200 of these had come out of the hand of Jack Leach and been repelled before the left-arm spinner eventually got one to pitch on middle, rag past a weary defensive shot and kiss the off stump before tea; the relief was palpable, with Root’s attack having already heard the dreaded words “third new ball” by this stage. Brathwaite looked downbeat as he walked off but at 385 for seven in the 169th over it was a case of mission accomplished, having provided the backbone for his side’s reply and doused the spirits of the travelling supporters to the extent that, when Sweet Caroline rung around the ground for the umpteenth time, they barely joined in. Their loudest cheers were arguably those that met the wickets claimed by Mahmood, recognising a wholehearted first outing and the agony he had felt when a maiden Test wicket was scrubbed off on the third day for a no-ball. After a soporific morning of 63 runs and one wicket – Ben Stokes removing nightwatchman Alzarri Joseph after 90 minutes of resistance – it finally came. Though the shot from Jason Holder after lunch was ugly, top-edging a slog, it still took a fine swirling catch from Matthew Fisher to get Mahmood off the mark. “I’m relieved more than anything,” Mahmood later said. “I felt the biggest criminal [after the no-ball]. When I got that one today, I had a little check there were no dramas.” The satisfaction of a simpler second for Mahmood came when Veerasammy Permaul, the No 9, was trapped lbw but this was another day of toil for England’s right-arm fast-mediums with no reverse swing owing to the early moisture on the ball. Fisher, the second debutant on show, was unable to add to his maiden Test wicket claimed way back on the second evening, Ben Stokes was worked the hardest and Chris Woakes was notably ignored for long periods by his captain. A wicket for Woakes eventually came as England picked off the West Indies tail, Roach given out lbw to a ball that was barely scratching leg stump. But it may be that the bowler England viewed as their attack leader on this tour has a breather in next week’s third Test in Grenada unless the floodgates open in the fourth innings. Ollie Robinson and Craig Overton are the spare seamers but if another pitch like this one is prepared, England will consider a second spinner – and another debutant – in Matt Parkinson. Certainly Leach could do with some help, sending down 69.5 overs for figures of three for 118 that were solid enough but also reflected a lack of air on the ball at times and West Indies eschewing risk. That said, the most recent first-class match played at the National Stadium in St George’s saw seamers to the fore and Leeward Islands roll Guyana by an innings in three days; a repeat might not generate the most revenue for the local cricket board but it would be livelier than the fare on offer to date.",Sport/Sport,Resilient Kraigg Brathwaite sets England tough task to win second Test,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/resilient-kraigg-brathwaite-sets-england-tough-task-to-win-second-test
3/20/2022,"Gareth Southgate says it is vital that sections of England’s support are given stronger assurances about their safety at the World Cup in Qatar, and that it will be “horrible” if people feel unable to travel because of human rights concerns. Among the many issues clouding this winter’s tournament is the fact that homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, while there are also serious problems surrounding women’s rights. While officials in the country have repeatedly stated that all supporters will be safe, there remains significant disquiet. Southgate explained that he has researched the problems that have caused alarm since Qatar was awarded hosting rights in 2010. “I think I’m quite clear on the areas of concern about this tournament,” he said. “The building of the stadiums was the first, and there’s nothing we can do about that now. They’re built. There are obviously ongoing concerns about the rights of workers and the conditions they live in and those areas. It seems universally accepted that’s better than it was, but not in the position where people think it could be. And maybe policies that have been put in place are not always enforced as they might be. “Then there are the issues that potentially threaten our fans when they travel: the rights of women and the rights of the LGBTQ+ community in particular. Sadly, through discussions that I’ve had, I don’t think some of those communities are going to go and that’s a great shame. “We stand for inclusivity as a team – that’s been the big driver of a lot of the stances we’ve taken in the last couple of years – and it would be horrible to think some of our fans feel they can’t go because they feel threatened or they’re worried about their safety. So there needs to be some clarity and some better communication that they are going to be safe, because they’re not feeling that.” Southgate said his squad, who will face Switzerland and Ivory Coast in friendlies during the forthcoming international break, will be apprised of these issues in particular. “What we’re going to try to do with the players is highlight that we think those are going to be the key areas,” he said. “There might be one or two others too.” The nature of any stand England might make to raise awareness, whether in Qatar or before, remains open to discussion. Denmark are displaying messages critical of Qatar on their training kit and reducing commercial activity around the event; Southgate said any display has to be meaningful but that there is also a limit to what he and his players can do, although talks are continuing. “I’m not sure that just wearing a T-shirt makes a difference,” he said. “I don’t totally know what we can do in every aspect. I think we have to be realistic about what that might be. There are some things we’re not going to be able to affect. Maybe there are some things we can affect; if we can and we think they’re worthwhile, we’ll try to do that. Without a doubt, one of the priorities in my mind is our own fans and how they’re going to be dealt with in particular. “Despite contradictory reports we are in regular contact with the NGOs. There are lots of conversations with organisations like Amnesty, so it’s not correct when they say discussions aren’t taking place. We’re trying to do the best we can. We’re going to get criticism here whatever happens. It won’t be deemed enough but we have always tried to affect things in the right way.” On the pitch Southgate is heartened by the fact that Harry Kane, whose form earlier in the season was a concern, is close to his best again. The England captain has scored seven in as many games at club level, suggesting he has shaken off any malaise brought about by his failed attempt to leave Tottenham last summer. “It’s been good to see Harry scoring,” Southgate said. “He’s always a happier animal when he comes in if he’s been scoring. Physically, the way Antonio [Conte] works and trains the team, I think that will have been good for Harry, to help get the best level out of him.”",Sport/Football,Southgate voices England concerns about human rights at Qatar World Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/gareth-southgate-england-human-rights-qatar-world-cup
3/20/2022,"Repudiating any suggestion Manchester City are having a wobble, Pep Guardiola has declared his pride at what his team have already achieved this season and urged them to enjoy the run-in as they pursue trophies on three fronts. City’s lead over Liverpool at the top of the Premier League has been trimmed from 14 points to one and they have failed to score in their past two matches in all competitions, a drought by their standards. On Sundaythey face a testing FA Cup sixth-round tie at particularly pesky opponents, with Southampton having drawn with them twice in the league this season. Guardiola says he wants his players to relish the high stakes. “These are the moments why we are here,” he said. “This is why we watched the Champions League draw together [on Friday]. We have fought since pre-season to arrive here. It makes me happy. Everyone wants to win already but the run we have been on to be where we are now makes me so proud. My expectations are so high but, at the same time, during the process I am satisfied. “We went to Peterborough [in the last round of the FA Cup] and we won and now we are going to Southampton. I congratulate the players and say ‘well done, good job’. Because I know how difficult it is. “I try to say to the club ‘enjoy these moments during the season. Don’t wait to win the Premier League, the Champions League or the FA Cup to be happy. Enjoy the day, enjoy the moment. “Like in Europe, enjoy being one of the elite clubs. Because one day maybe you will not be here. You will be out of the Champions League at the group stage or the last 16. Qualifying for the Champions League is difficult. People who believe you have to do that are wrong, that is a bad, bad message. Staying in the Champions League is a huge success, enormous. People say ‘no’ but you have to do a lot of good things to get there.” Guardiola said there is no reason for him or his players to worry about their 0-0 draw with Crystal Palace in their last outing. “Dropping points against Palace can happen. People believe – I don’t know why – that because we’re Manchester City we have to be 10 points clear of Liverpool. I don’t buy it. I know how difficult it is. How we behaved against Palace and how we will behave against Southampton, that’s what counts. “We don’t have to find explanations for something for which there is no explanation. One day a player puts the ball in the top corner from 20 yards, another day he misses the goal from five metres. Why? Because it’s football. Don’t find explanations for that.” Guardiola does, however, have an explanation for why Southampton have managed to frustrate his team twice this season, drawing 0-0 at the Etihad in September and 1-1 at St Mary’s in January. “Because they are good,” he said. “They are one of the intense teams, the rhythm they play with, their quality, their manager, their players.” That manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl, would pay to watch Sunday’s opponents and is looking forward to taking them on. Regardless of the result, he expects to learn something. “You take massive things out of his games,” the Austrian said of Guardiola. “When you can imagine about a challenge for a manager, this is the biggest one definitely. “Hopefully we see a really good Cup game and I am sure we will because it is two teams that want to play football, two teams that want to create chances, that are looking for an intense way of playing football. “They are so fantastic to watch – if I was a football fan, I would go there for sure.”",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola tells Treble-chasing Manchester City to enjoy the pressure,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-southampton-fa-cup
3/20/2022,"Thomas Tuchel said he was impressed by his Chelsea players’ discipline and focus as, refusing to be distracted by the club’s impending sale, they swept Middlesbrough aside to reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup. “My players have not surprised me but they have impressed me,” said Tuchel following the 2-0 win which came 24 hours after the deadline passed for prospective buyers to submit bids to replace the sanctioned Roman Abramovich. “The trust and team spirit was impressive. That is the culture at our club. “No matter what we do and how much we worry we cannot change the situation so we have to find a certain way of accepting the situation and accepting what we can influence.” The German seemed more concerned about the more junior employees at Stamford Bridge than himself and his squad. “I’m absolutely OK,” he said. “I feel very privileged, but there are 700 or 800 people working at Chelsea and they are very worried about their position so it is my responsibility to show the right spirit and positivity in a situation we did not cause and cannot change. The players have huge talent but with it comes huge responsibility and they are doing it for the people at Chelsea.” Tuchel professed to lack inside knowledge on the progress of the sale. “I don’t know anything about the offers,” he said. “How many serious offers there are or who they are from.” The Chelsea Supporters’ Trust earlier confirmed discussions had been held with prospective new owners as it continues to push for greater fan involvement in Chelsea’s future. The trust has set out a number of expectations of any new owner, including a “golden share”, which would essentially give supporters the right to exercise a veto over certain important decisions. In a statement it said: “The CST has played an important role over these difficult weeks. We have held positive discussions with a number of prospective bidders.” The British property investor Nick Candy, leading a £2bn bid alongside the South Korean companies Hana Financial Group and C&P Sports Limited, has pledged to advocate for a golden share if his offer is successful, while the former British Airways chairman Sir Martin Broughton – leading a rival bid with Sebastian Coe – has also promised to increase the involvement of fans. Broughton told BBC Radio 4’s Today: “[Fans] can come and get all the benefits of ownership and veto rights for free, and we’re open to discounts and investments. We’d be interested [in selling shares at a discount] if that’s what the fans want.” Besides the bids led by Candy and Broughton, other offers are understood to have been made by the financial firm Aethel Partners, by the Ricketts family – owners of the US baseball team the Chicago Cubs – and by the Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss, who has linked up with the LA Dodgers co-owner Todd Boehly, the British businessman Jonathan Goldstein and the Conservative peer Daniel Finkelstein. The bidders now face a wait to learn if their bids will be progressed. Chelsea and Raine Group, the US bank handling the sale process, are expected to make a shortlist before naming a preferred bid, which will then require government approval. That process will involve proving the source of funds and where the sale proceeds go. The Turkish businessman Muhsin Bayrak, meanwhile, who had expressed interest, said that his company had not filed a bid to Raine owing to a misunderstanding with his lawyers over the auction procedure. “I am very upset,” he told Reuters.",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel lauds ‘trust and team spirit’ after Chelsea win at Boro,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/thomas-tuchel-lauds-trust-and-team-spirit-after-chelsea-win-at-boro
3/20/2022,"No doubts, no caveats. Marcell Jacobs proved emphatically that he is the fastest man on the planet as he won a race for the ages at the world indoor championships. Many had derided Jacobs’ 100m Olympic gold medal in Tokyo last year as a fluke. But he summoned a performance of devastating serenity to defeat the world 60m record holder Christian Coleman in a barnstormer of a contest that lived up to its billing. Coleman, who was back after serving an 18-month ban for missing three drugs tests, made his usual fluid start and was ahead after 30m. But Jacobs didn’t flinch or adjust his form. Gradually he gained. Until, just at the moment the two men crossed the line, he got his chest in front. Both men had run 6.41 seconds – the ninth quickest time in history. But, after an eternal wait, Jacobs got the nod by three-thousandths of a second. “I hoped and prayed, please first, and it happened,” he said. He was then asked whether he thought he had proved a point. “Of course,” he replied. “Now I’m an Olympic and world champion.” Another American, Marvin Bracy, took bronze in 6.44, while Britain’s Adam Thomas was fifth in 6.60 sec. But while he may have lost this battle, Coleman insisted he would be back for more in the summer. “I think it’ll be neck and neck like today,” he said. “He’s a great athlete and I’m looking forward to the competition.” Elsewhere on the second day of competition there were gold medals for Olympic 400m champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo, who ran a storming 50.31 sec to beat Femke Bol, and Sandi Morris in the women’s pole vault. Meanwhile Jereem Richards ran a championship record 45.00 to take the men’s 400m. He dedicated his victory to his friend and team-mate Deon Lendore, who died in a car crash, saying: “Rest in peace, man.” However British Athletics was facing the prospect of leaving these championships without a medal after its best hope of gold, Keely Hodgkinson, was forced to pull out through injury. The 20-year-old had been the odds-on favourite to win the 800m, having run the sixth fastest time in history last month.

3/20/2022,"They did all they could. Apart from winning in Paris, of course. But Ireland finished their Six Nations deliriously brandishing the triple crown in front of their euphoric faithful, as well as a fifth bonus point of five. Alas, one of those happened to be in defeat, the one in Paris. They have no doubt pored over that already, identified why they lost, how they could have won, but they quickly returned to the business of winning with gusto and should feel at least as well placed as France as 2023 grows ever nearer. Whichever way you look at it, Ireland continue to develop impressive momentum. Here they were too powerful for a visiting Scotland side who played with all the brio and pace we have come to expect – but without the heavy-duty weaponry that lifts Ireland into a category above. Scotland played in devil-may-care mode, another championship long gone, a new playmaker at fly-half, and nothing to lose. Nothing to win either, bar maybe a victory far too late, but they are never less than dangerous these days. Alas, their slashes and parries could not break Ireland’s skin. And Ireland knew how to break theirs. They had to wait till the death to register that fourth try, but no one was surprised when it came. Ireland’s game was spearheaded by some ferocious forwards, in particular yet another bristling hooker for the future in Dan Sheehan. The balance of, well, power when the game crept to within charging distance of either tryline was firmly in their favour. The modern narrative between these two resumed pretty much from the kick-off – that is to say, of course, that Scotland slashed with their rapier, to which Ireland responded with a bludgeon. That may be a crude summary – Ireland certainly know how to deploy sleight of hand when the situation demands – but when it comes to the close quarters in what people do love to refer to these days as the Red Zone, Ireland could resort to some brutal weapons. Hence their early 14-0 lead, despite some exhilarating approach work from their visitors. The trouble with the rapier is that it requires a higher level of accuracy to make tell. Darcy Graham slashed this way and that, as did Ali Price, as did Hamish Watson, small and darting all of them. Pierre Schoeman is not so little, but he too found himself in space early on. Nothing of substance came from any of it. Then Ireland had a go. Jamison Gibson-Park wielded his own rapier, which Stuart Hogg dealt with masterfully, but soon some flashing hands by Ireland’s backs created an attack down the left. Over to the bludgeon. A penalty was sent to the corner, the lineout secured and, towards the end of the first quarter, Sheehan broke off the maul to force his way over the line. Ten minutes later, another lineout and another charge by Sheehan set Ireland up for some more boshing. Cian Healy was the next to barge over for a try. Scotland were exasperated to find themselves 14-0 down with only half an hour gone but they responded. Graham was off again down the right after flashing Scottish hands released him, then Watson slipped a fabulous ball to Schoeman, Graham darted again – the usual suspects – off an inside ball from Scotland’s new fly-half, Blair Kinghorn, and moments later, Schoeman burrowed to the line. Kinghorn was looking elegant at No 10. And if anyone in these parts can hoof a ball as far as Hogg, he is that man. Alas, his conversion was not so great, so Scotland went in 14-5 down at the break. They knew they had to be the first to score after it. They duly created the clearest-cut chance – and they missed it. Hogg and rapier are basically synonymous, but he has history here of missing precious opportunities. Here was another. He was clean through on the last man, with Chris Harris and Kyle Steyn free inside him, and he went himself. Hugo Keenan made it across to tackle him into the corner. Scotland’s moment had gone. Ireland took advantage on the hour. Scotland managed to thwart one attacking lineout but they set up another after Scotland were penalised at their own scrum. Mack Hansen combined with James Lowe and Ireland were in a position to bludgeon. But it was a smart switch pass by Gibson-Park that released Josh van der Flier to burst through the last tacklers. Conor Murray claimed the fourth at the death, barrelling through three tacklers off Lowe’s pass from out of a maul. From there Ireland waited in vain for the bonus of the title, but the sense in Dublin was that they were more than happy already.",Sport/Sport,Conor Murray seals Ireland win over Scotland to claim triple crown,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/ireland-scotland-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report
3/20/2022,"There have been some thumping French grand slam victories but never one that has rippled so ominously around the world. Not for a dozen years have France claimed a Six Nations clean sweep but in many ways the dazzling beauty of this one lies in what might still lie ahead. On this evidence anyone else planning to win next year’s Rugby World Cup is going to be disappointed. England’s players deserve considerable credit simply for hanging in the fight but once Antoine Dupont had surged irresistibly clear at the start of the final quarter to put his side clear at 25-13 it was in effect all over. Not a solitary English supporter in the bouncing stadium or sitting back at home could say the outcome of this compelling finale was anything other than totally deserved. The final table rarely lies, either, and the best team in the tournament duly finished well ahead of the pack. England were a touch fortunate that Scotland and Wales both lost on the final day, thus sparing them the indignity of a second successive bottom-half finish, but there could be no hiding from the frequently uneven battle at the breakdown, the power of the French forwards or the rock-solid composure of the home side’s outstanding defence. With Melvyn Jaminet to slot the goals and the understated Gaël Fickou arguably the player of the championship, it was also lucky for Eddie Jones’s outclassed side that a few early nerves affected their hosts’ handling. But if the stadium was rocking to its foundations, just imagine the atmosphere when the Rugby World Cup kicks off next year. Were the tournament commencing this week, Les Bleus would be favourites and they still look to have plenty of growth in them. ‘Super Saturday’ certainly lived up to its billing, even if the most stunning performance of the day had already been delivered by Italy in Cardiff. As a beautiful sunny day gave way to a cool, still evening, there were so many tricolores around the stadium it felt more like a slickly orchestrated political rally than a game of rugby. Highlights of past French triumphs on the big screen, a stunning lightshow, fireworks, epic music‚ you half expected Fabien Galthié to be fired out of the tunnel from a cannon. As Jones had acknowledged in the build up, though, this was also an acid test for England. Operation Grand Chelem screamed the headline on the front cover of L’Equipe and the mission statement needed no translating. England, in the final analysis, offered stout defiance and an occasionally productive kick-chasing game but could not remotely match the all-court game of their opponents. Passion, pride and perseverance are all important qualities but, as Italy triumphantly demonstrated in Wales, there is also a fourth ‘p’ in the mix. The positivity that oozes from the Azzurri’s young full-back Ange Capuozzo will be just as much of a crucial World Cup prerequisite on firm pitches at a French World Cup as set-piece solidity. That said, France’s defensive barricade is now a major stumbling block for all and sundry. Quite content to allow Ellis Genge to charge at them from deep, the home side absorbed a short spell of early pressure with total composure and only a few fumbled balls saved England from shipping a couple of early tries. By the 15th minute, though, the dam had already burst, with Fickou gathering Romain Ntamack’s long pass to reward an ominous spell of all-court pressure. Jaminet had already knocked over a scrum penalty and England were suitably grateful for three relieving points of their own from Marcus Smith. They were also fortunate not to be reduced to 14 men after Jack Nowell took out a soaring Jaminet in the air, with the referee, Jaco Peyper, awarding a penalty the other way for obstruction. With England getting regularly picked off at the breakdown, however, it did not remotely knock France out of their stride. A second Jaminet penalty and Nowell’s premature departure with a hand injury further tilted the scales and, after yet another butchered opportunity, Gabin Villière and Anthony Jelonch combined to set up flanker François Cros for a stretching score just before the break to make it 18-6. At least England can say that courage in adversity is not an area of concern. Over the course of the championship, few have enhanced their top-level reputation more than Maro Itoje, with Genge not far behind. Smith now also has a full championship season behind him and will ultimately be the better for it. There was a flicker of try-scoring promise, too, Freddie Steward muscling his way over in the right corner after 47 minutes for only the third try his team have scored in four games away from Rome. Steward and Joe Marchant both had good games but maybe there is a simpler bottom line: France are currently just better than England, full stop. Admittedly Luke Cowan-Dickie’s yellow card against Scotland, when his side were ahead, and Charlie Ewels’ second-minute red against Ireland both proved extremely costly but third position is a fair reflection of England’s middling season. Only one of these two sides presently looks like winning next year’s World Cup and it is not the battered and bruised men in white.",Sport/Sport,Antoine Dupont try sinks England and secures grand slam for France,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/france-england-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report
3/20/2022,"The Riverside has been no stranger to the sight of empty seats in recent years, but on Saturday those that surrounded the 700 or so Chelsea fans who had managed to buy tickets before Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government told not of Middlesbrough’s troubles but a more poignant story of the state of English football. Football’s capacity to normalise the most ludicrous scenarios is remarkable. It is only three weeks since Abramovich declared his intention to hand over “stewardship and care” of the club to its trustees and yet that already feels at least two major news cycles ago. The idea that Chelsea have to be parted from their owner because they have, for almost two decades, been a pawn in a far greater game has been generally assimilated. We have done the weary horror, the ‘what-have-we-become?’ of the league game against Newcastle. This was the first domestic away game where the sanctions had an impact on ticket sales, but there will be gaps at home games, a complete absence of away fans and the possibility of a half-empty Wembley for the semi-final, depending how the FA can organise ticket sales – which are usually conducted through the club. At some point the impact on ticket sales will stop being mentioned. Then there will be a new owner and a concrete new reality to get used to. The current crisis has been generally assimilated – but not yet universally. There remains a sense that some elements of the club have not fully accepted the reality of the present situation, the fact that they have been granted special dispensation to carry on playing that would not ordinarily be granted to the majority of businesses. Attempts to have the game played behind closed doors on the grounds of “sporting integrity” were rightly derided and ultimately withdrawn. Some fans, the vocal minority who use photographs of Abramovich as their social media avatars and get themselves interviewed on vox pops, persist in seeing the whole tragedy of Ukraine through the lens of football, as though Chelsea are the victims of some complex conspiracy and the war just a useful excuse to confound them. The vast majority of the Chelsea fans at the Riverside, it should be said, stood and joined the pre-match applause for Ukraine. A banner on the seats at the front of the stand read “Tuchel for PM” – something suggested by Joe Cole earlier in the week – and it says much for the statesmanlike way in which he has handled an extremely awkward period that the instinctive reaction to the sentiment is that he has the humanity and basic decency, the sense of responsibility, that used to be a prerequisite for leaders. After all the talk of Chelsea travelling to Middlesbrough by bus, they ended up flying to Teesside International – only the most cynical, though, would think that they have been over-dramatising their immediate plight to gain public sympathy. For now, though, the storm remains that is yet fully to break. From a playing point of view, life has so far, bar a few pointed chants from opposing fans, gone on largely as normal, whatever the threats may be for the future, with Chelsea winning every game since Abramovich announced his intention to step away from the club. But there is also a secondary timeframe. While geopolitics is going through one of its phases of acceleration, football retains the familiar rhythms. Last time Romelu Lukaku started a game for Chelsea was in the fifth round of the FA Cup against Luton, when he was just a misfit £100m striker, rather the costliest human resource of a sanctioned business. He scored then, as he had scored against Chesterfield in the third round, and got his third in the competition this season after 19 minutes, touching in a Mason Mount cross. From that point, frankly, this was a very straightforward afternoon for Chelsea. Middlesbrough never looked to have the quality to really trouble them, while Hakim Ziyech and Mason Mount had little problem finding the space that allowed them to slice Boro apart. On the pitch, it was all rather anti-climactic, but with Chelsea the story these days is only partially about that. Their present reality was written, the red plastic seats in the south-east corner of the ground.",Sport/Football,Empty seats in FA Cup a visible reminder of Chelsea’s present reality | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/19/empty-seats-in-fa-cup-a-visible-reminder-of-chelseas-present-reality
3/20/2022,"Two sleepless days after Eduard Lysovysk was carried into a basement bomb shelter, his thigh bone shattered by a Russian sniper’s bullet, soldiers from the army who had shot him came to visit. Heavy shelling outside had pinned him and dozens of neighbours into the cramped dugout, where he would spend a week in agony, waiting for a chance to flee the neighbourhood he once called home. The Russian soldiers stood over the man they had injured, his leg tied up with bandages torn from bedsheets and held in place with a makeshift splint, and told Lysovysk: “We have come to protect you.” Lysovysk’s wife, Iryna, undaunted by the guns, asked them: “Protect us from what? From our own homes?” Lysovysk had been shot as he evacuated her and an elderly neighbour from their apartment building across the balconies, after CCTV showed Russian soldiers in the hallway. The single round slammed into his leg as he stood at the edge of a crowd by a bomb shelter door, after the second evacuation trip. No other shots were fired towards the group, and no one else was hurt. After Lysovysk spent a day of agony, without painkillers or antibiotics, his wife went to ask the Russian soldiers for help. “We said we have injured, and need things like blankets and duvets,” she told the Observer. They let her briefly back into the couple’s flat, which had lost its door and was filled with 10 Russian officers, then sent the medic, who changed Lysovysk’s bandages, gave him a single dose of antibiotics, and left. There was no offer of further medical treatment or evacuation and, by day five after the shooting, Lysovysk was running a fever. Iryna went out again to seek another round of medicine. “It felt awful, because they were on our territory and they got to feel like they were helping us but I had no other choice but to ask,” she said. During that long ordeal, the pain of his shattered leg was relieved only by the courage and generosity of neighbours who risked shelling and gunfire to comb their apartments for painkillers to share. The Lysovysks and their neighbours were plunged into the most intense horror of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine from the start of the war, by an accident of geography. They lived in Hostomel, a Kyiv dormitory town beside a cargo airbase of the same name, which Russia tried to seize from the first night of the war, and fought over for days. Chechen troops known for their ruthlessness were part of the mission, launched so rapidly that residents barely had time to consider escaping before the full fury of battle swept through their town. In the week before his injury, Lysovysk witnessed and captured in photos and videos the atrocities unfolding around him. His images and testimony form a powerful, and unusually comprehensive diary of those bloody days in an area now under Russian control. They also provide important visual evidence of crimes that have been widely reported, but less frequently preserved on video or in photos, because of fear and Russian confiscation of phones. This includes the shooting of civilians as they tried to escape. On 25 February, a day after the invasion began, he noticed a car outside his apartment block with shattered windows, its radiator leaking on to the ground. He went to check it out and realised the bullets had also found a human target inside. An 18-year-old boy was slumped in the passenger seat. Another neighbour, who arrived first at the scene, said his grandmother was trying to drive them both to safety. He had been hit in the eye; she had kept going for nearly two miles after being shot, trying to reach a village outside town – perhaps in shock, or in the vain hope of reaching medics. An ambulance had taken her to hospital, but it was too late for the young man. Even so early in the war, medics had no space in their vehicles for the dead, so the body was left behind for burial. In the violent days that followed, Lysovysk, a former construction worker, continued to document how the war was unfolding around him. Refugees escaping occupied areas have repeatedly described Russian soldiers shooting at their cars, even when marked with white flags or carrying signs saying “children”, and seeing abandoned vehicles with bodies inside. One video he took from a motorway outside town captures apparent evidence of a massacre. Seven civilian cars, riddled with bullet holes, have been abandoned beside the road. In one dark red Lada, keys still lie on the bloodstained seats, although all the dead or injured occupants had been taken away. As the battle worsened, food supplies began to run out. Eduard filmed workers from the office of mayor Yuriy Prylypko giving jars of vegetables, potatoes and other food to trapped residents, and asked why they were not distributing guns instead so that residents could fight. “They told me the Russians had taken over the national guard base inside Hostomel where all the guns were stored, and so there were no weapons to give out.” Five days later, Prylypko was shot dead by the invaders while handing out bread to civilians. On 3 March, Russian tanks rolled into town and soldiers began setting up base in a construction site near the Lysovysks’ home. That night they moved into the apartment block. Screenshots from CCTV show men in military camouflage milling in the hallway, and the couple saw the group place something outside their door, which they feared was a tripwire. Their home was on the ground floor, so they decided to climb over their balconies the next morning to escape to a bomb shelter across the street. When daylight returned, Lysovysk first helped his 59-year-old wife to the bomb shelter, and went back for an elderly neighbour on the same floor. With both rescues complete, he took a moment outside the shelter to make a phone call, and as he stood still the sniper pulled his trigger. “It hit me, and my leg just collapsed out to the side. It looked like I had two knees,” said Lysovysk, speaking from his hospital bed in Bila Tservka, a city south of Kyiv that has been spared intense fighting. He was taken there for treatment because his injuries are so complex and doctors say he will need multiple surgeries to regain use of his leg; the bone was shattered. “He shouted and fell,” said Iryna Lysovysk, who was standing beside him. “We only just managed to drag him into the shelter.” The crowd inside helped rip up sheets to make a tourniquet and dress the wound. He later bound it with a makeshift splint, to keep the leg straight, and the couple sent messages to friends, asking for an ambulance because they couldn’t get through to emergency services. Then they turned off their mobiles and hid them behind jars of pickled vegetables, after they were warned by people in the basement that the Russians had been confiscating people’s phones. “They took some people’s phones and in other cases, just ripped the sim cards out,” Iryna Lysovysk said. When the Russian soldiers came, Lysovysk was lying on the floor, clearly immobile and in terrible pain, but the men kept their fingers on their triggers. “It was like they were afraid of me,” he said. “They said, ‘it wasn’t us who shot you, it was a Ukrainian sniper’, but I said, ‘Tell me where they are?’” In over a week of fighting the Lysovsks had only once seen a small detachment of six soldiers in Ukrainian uniform. “I had seen the (Russian) sniper eye to eye, 20m away from us, he was in the next apartment block over, the construction block.” On 9 March, two days after the mayor was shot, Hostomel’s residents were finally told they could evacuate through a humanitarian corridor; most went on foot to a collection point. But Lysovysk couldn’t walk and needed to lie flat, and in the rush to escape the terrifying basement shelters and the constant thud of shells and rockets, no one with a car could make room for him. The next day, they used cardboard to patch the windows of a neighbour’s bombed-out minibus and laid him on the floor – the beginning of his long journey to recovery. But when they made it to safety, the couple found one final, devastating stroke of Russian cruelty; the troops hadn’t only denied Lysovysk medical care from their own doctors, they also blocked Ukrainian help. Relatives had called an ambulance on the day he was shot, and it had got 300 metres from his shelter when Russians turned it back. “If we had only known,” said Iryna Lysovysk, staring at her injured husband, who could have been spared most of his terrible ordeal. “We would have carried him there ourselves.”",News/World news,"‘We have to come to protect you,’ Russian soldiers told Ukrainian man they’d shot",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/we-have-to-come-to-protect-you-russian-soldiers-told-ukrainian-man-theyd-shot
3/20/2022,"“Losing to Madrid hurts but we’re closer to winning,” Gerard Piqué said at the end of the last clásico. It was a curious kind of consolation after yet another defeat knocked Barcelona out of the Spanish Super Cup, but this time there was something for them to cling to. That, at least, was the hope and since then it has hardened into something more tangible. The 282nd meeting between these clubs may offer an indication of how much closer they have come or how far they still have to travel. Fifteen points behind, it is too late for Barcelona to win the league, the title in Madrid’s hands with weeks to spare, but maybe the clásico can become a proper contest again. Not so much on Sunday night, although that too, but beyond. In that last meeting in January, Barcelona were beaten 3-2 in Saudi Arabia. The outcome was depressingly familiar for them, but at least it hadn’t been a drubbing: it had taken a 99th-minute goal from Fede Valverde to defeat them and at the point they had started to take control. “Playing like this we’ll compete for titles,” Piqué said, while the Catalan daily El Mundo Deportivo led its front page on “They fall with honour”. Inside it declared “Barcelona are not completely back, but almost.” Xavi Hernández, appointed two months earlier, said: “We were the better team in play and dominating the game. If you toss a coin and it comes out heads, no one complains, but it came out tails. This could have been a turning point in terms of the result, but it [still] is in terms of play.” Some laughed at them. A lot laughed, in fact. Barcelona had been overrun in the first half and the bottom line was inescapable: they had still lost. That made it five clásicos in a row. They stood accused of celebrating defeat, the way they clung to an empty moral victory a humiliation in itself: how the mighty have fallen. But that was pretty much the point. Many expected a destruction but Barcelona had competed, offering some hope, some football. And soon talk of a turning point didn’t look so misplaced. In the next game, Barcelona were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Athletic Bilbao. But the winter window closed with Dani Alves, Ferran Torres, Adama Traoré and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang joining. Ousmane Dembélé had not departed, Xavi soon making a virtue of that failure. The coach’s vision was becoming ever more apparent, an identity emerging, an entire shift in culture discernible. Something was building, the only criticism of Xavi’s appointment now that it hadn’t come sooner. When he reached his 100th day in charge, Xavi said it felt “like 100 years” and last week he said there is too much going on in his head to be able to enjoy this. But he admits it’s getting better, a little better all the time. The last clásico showed it could, and since defeat at Athletic, Barcelona have gone 11 without losing. The team for whom European away games have been an almost endless trauma have won in Napoli and Istanbul, reaching the Europa League quarter-finals. They put four past Atlético Madrid; they have scored four goals five times in 10 games and climbed back into a Champions League place for the first time this season. Sunday’s points matter: victory would mean taking second from Sevilla remains in their own hands; lose and Atlético and Betis could overtake while Real Sociedad could move to within a point. Reality remains. On Friday, these clubs watched different European draws: Madrid awaited opponents in the Champions League, Barcelona in the Europa League. On Monday, they were confronted by different financial realities too when La Liga published salary limits: Madrid’s is €739m, Barcelona’s minus €144m. Much as Joan Laporta, Barcelona’s bullish president, said they would try to win the league, they accept they cannot. Not this year, at least. There is an assuredness about Madrid that makes them formidable opponents, and time has run out, the gap too great. But next year and the years beyond that no longer look so bleak for Barcelona; they certainly will not if they can end that run against Madrid, the ultimate measure of where they are, a sign they can build for better days. This league has gone, but others needn’t do the same. Besides, the clásico always has a meaning beyond the maths. Carlo Ancelotti was asked how his team could possibly lose the league now that they had moved 10 points clear with 10 games to go. “How can you lose a European Cup final when you’re 3-0 up?” the manager of Milan in 2005 replied. He knows, and so does Xavi. Yet the Barcelona manager’s response to a similar question contained an idea that can at least be entertained now, the hope of a clásico that is competitive again. “We can’t be very optimistic about the league: Real Madrid would have to lose three or four and they haven’t all season,” he said. “Quite honestly, It’s very difficult – even if we win at the Bernabéu.”",Sport/Football,El clásico: Xavi’s Barça head to Real Madrid with unexpected optimism,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/el-clasico-xavi-barcelona-head-to-real-madrid-with-unexpected-optimism
3/20/2022,"Aquestion: when will a Manchester City No 9 truly be a No 9 and not a false one, as when Pep Guardiola fields Bernardo Silva, Raheem Sterling, Jack Grealish, or Gabriel Jesus to “lead” the line? Answer: when Erling Haaland or another recognised centre-forward targeted by the manager is signed in the summer. Those named above in Guardiola’s current squad operate as the supposed lone striker, but in his carousel of revolving positions any attack-minded player is informed to float into an advanced central berth and dizzy opponents. In this mode City are the piquant entertainers who claimed last term’s Premier League with no natural No 9 for most of the campaign and whose title defence this season will not feature one at all. City are the leaders, by a point from Liverpool, with nine matches left. They are at Southampton on Sunday in the FA Cup quarter-finals and were drawn against Atlético Madrid on Friday in the Champions League last eight as they chase a Treble he believes is possible if particularly tough to achieve. Yet Guardiola’s striker-less wonders still require an elite one, he insists, so when the next window opens the club will resume a chase that failed last summer to land Harry Kane. The new head of the list is Haaland. After Monday’s stumble at Crystal Palace – 0-0, chances spurned – Guardiola can expect a) to be posed more questions about the Borussia Dortmund man; and b) to hear from the told-you-so brigade about how trying to be champions again with no 20-goal-a-season marksman was always going to be folly. Guardiola, a shrewd operator, has already preempted these scenarios, saying he gets “killed” for the latter whenever points are dropped and, regarding the former, via a mantra heard in several media briefings that “Manchester City definitely need a striker”. This is a novel discourse for a manager who adores a midfielder. To hear Guardiola, an accomplished No 6 from the Barcelona school of schemers, be so unequivocal regarding the desire for a prolific scorer can jar. Then there is the empirical evidence the table shows: City are first, their 68 goals ranking second only to Liverpool who also lack a consistently scoring No 9. Roberto Firmino is the regular there but the Brazilian’s league returns are 12, nine and nine in the past three seasons, with five after 16 appearances this term (though he has been injured). They do, though, have Mo Salah – the Golden Boot winner of 2016-17, who registered 22, 19 and 22 in the following campaigns and has 20 in this – plus the support acts of Sadio Mané (12 this season, 11, 18 and 22 in the previous three) and Diogo Jota (13 and nine, in the current and last terms). City have been the kings of sharing goals around. In Guardiola’s first three seasons the now departed Sergio Agüero hit 20, 21, and 21. The latter two tallies were accumulated in championship-winning XIs: the first featured contributions from Sterling (18), Jesus (13) and Leroy Sané (10). In the second, Sterling (17) and Sané (10) were to the fore, while Bernardo Silva, Riyad Mahrez and Jesus all chipped in with seven. This season Sterling and Mahrez have 10 apiece, Kevin De Bruyne nine, Phil Foden and Silva seven each. Agüero’s exit last summer left a club-record 260-goal hole in the forward line. This is why first Kane was pursued and now Haaland. The Norwegian’s numbers for Dortmund: 16 in 15 Bundesliga appearances, six assists; 23 strikes in 22 appearances in all competitions, including three in three Champions League outings. Overall career statistics: 80 in 80 for Dortmund, 20 in 20 for Molde, 29 in 27 for Salzburg, and 12 in 15 for Norway, the zero in 16 for his first club, Bryne, long forgotten. This record is one reason why Guardiola is keen to sign the 21-year-old: imagine how many more goals City would score with Haaland in the XI. But another relates to City’s defence and how the opposition try to unlock it. Here, think of the home reverses to Palace (2-0) and Tottenham (3-2), plus myriad matches where Guardiola’s high-lying rearguard has been vulnerable to raids launched over the top or along the sides. The tactic requires a low block that is tricky for City to break down. In most contests this is managed by a kind of speedy five-a-side play that incorporates passing down the wings and incisive penalty area forays. When, though, this is failing, Guardiola wants a dedicated target-man to offer variation. “If we have a striker, we play in a different way but if you don’t have it you have to adapt with the quality [abilities] that we have,” he says. What Haaland – or any No 9 – must also possess is an ability to be fluid, to understand and execute City’s constant off-the-front patterns. The Norwegian has this, as was illustrated by Marco Reus’s strike in last season’s 2-1 Champions League defeat at City: Haaland dropped into a pocket to become a de facto No 10 who created the chance. So in the pursuit of Haaland (or anyone else) Guardiola wants to recruit yet another smart-brained, pass-and-move footballer, but one who adds an Agüero-like proven eye for goal to a squad already bristling with talent.

3/20/2022,"Every year the question is asked: what is the point of the FA Cup, why should we care? This is not the Premier League, with its slick production values, glamorous stars at every turn and sense of dramatic urgency. There’s no great sense that it matters: you lose, you’re out and it has no bearing on the race for fourth. You win the thing and your manager still gets sacked a few days or weeks or months later – between 2012 and 2018, Arsène Wenger was the only FA Cup-winning manager still to be in his job a year later. Yet it remains a tremendously democratic institution and, amid everything else – the landmark final, the money it diverts down the pyramid, the chance it offers smaller clubs for a day to mark indelibly in their history (the time we won at Burnley, the afternoon we drew with West Ham, the night we played at Everton …), it offers a reminder of games that used to be. And for fans of a certain age, disillusioned by the transformation of clubs into commercial vehicles or tools of soft power, nostalgia may be the most important thing we have left: it’s the only thing to look forward to – the past. It was 44 years ago on Tuesday that Nottingham Forest claimed their first major trophy of the Brian Clough era, winning a League Cup final replay against Liverpool, the team they face in an FA Cup quarter-final on Sunday night. Getting to a replay had been a matter of some fortune. Forest were without three cup-tied players, including Peter Shilton, which meant a start in goal for Chris Woods who, at 18 years and 124 days, remains the youngest goalkeeper to play in a Wembley final. With Colin Barrett injured and John McGovern struggling through with a tight groin, Liverpool dominated but were thwarted by the brilliance of Woods. “He kept his cool,” wrote John Lawson in the Nottingham Evening Post, “revealed the immense natural talent that he possesses and stole the hearts of a Wembley crowd as well as headline acclaim.” Before the replay at Old Trafford, Clough’s assistant, Peter Taylor, took the squad to Scarborough, ostensibly to relax them, although the trip served a useful secondary function in helping him move some furniture up to an apartment he had bought there. Unorthodox, perhaps, but it stressed that Forest were outsiders, that they did things differently, that they were rebels against the establishment. Clough was somebody who always scorned tactical discussion, but it is remarkable how often at key moments he or Taylor would make a significant tweak. McGovern’s groin was too sore to be risked and so he was replaced by John O’Hare. That pushed John Robertson into a deeper role, giving Forest a more compact shape that helped cut off the supply to Kenny Dalglish, a cautious, patient approach that would offer the blueprint for the European success to come. Woods made early saves from Phil Neal and Dalglish and Alan Kennedy had an effort ruled out for handball before Robertson got the only goal with a 53rd-minute penalty after Phil Thompson had tripped O’Hare. It was, Thompson admitted, “a professional foul”, and today it would be a clear red card, but Liverpool were furious. “I knew he was outside the area when I kicked him,” Thompson said, while Tommy Smith dismissed the performance of the referee, Pat Partridge, as “bloody ridiculous” and suggested he “should be shot”. The temptation is to see all this as another world, a knockabout place without VAR when nobody had heard the phrase “denying a goalscoring opportunity”, when players acted as removal men and frustrated defenders could call for the assassination of referees without fearing some social media warrior might take them seriously, when Nottingham Forest could be a major club. But the modern game was beginning to emerge. As early as 1969, Maurice Edwards had written in the Derby Evening Telegraph of “a super league within Division 1” that was beginning to pull away from the rest. There were no funds – hedge, sovereign wealth or public investment – and no oligarchs, but there was an awareness that as football’s popularity grew and, thanks to Match of the Day and England’s World Cup win, it became mass public entertainment, there was a risk that a self-perpetuating elite would emerge. Edwards was right. He named Liverpool, Leeds “and others”. If you assume by that he meant Arsenal, Everton and Manchester United, 30 of the next 35 league titles would be won by that five-team elite before Roman Abramovich’s Chelsea broke the sequence. Of the other five, one was won by Aston Villa, in 1969 still the joint-third most successful side in English history; one by a Blackburn fuelled by the millions of Jack Walker; two by Derby, once under Clough and once in effect by the team he had left behind; and one by Forest. Clough’s genius held off almost single-handed the emergence of an elite group of super-clubs for a decade. Forest had no wealthy backers. In 1977, they were run by a committee headed by the chairman, Brian Appleby, a lawyer, and his deputy, Stuart Dryden, a sub-postmaster. Forest were constantly short of cash, which led to the gamble in 1979-80 on building the Executive Stand at a cost of £2.5m. When the signings of Justin Fashanu, Peter Ward and Ian Wallace didn’t work out, the repayments proved a crippling burden. The decline of Forest from European champions to top-six challengers in the 80s tends to be put down to Clough’s falling out with Taylor, and that clearly was a major factor, but so, too, were basic issues of finance. Of course mistakes have been made, some of them major, and, of course, things might have been different had different decisions been taken, but Forest’s post-Clough decline has essentially returned them to the status they held before he took over. Their improvement under Steve Cooper has brought FA Cup wins over Arsenal and Leicester, already created memories that will be treasured by this generation, but Sunday is the reminder of another time, that more innocent age when one extraordinary manager could still hold back the tides of economic history.",Sport/Football,Forest v Liverpool FA Cup tie offers reminder of another time in Clough era  | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/19/fa-cup-tie-offers-reminder-of-another-time-with-nottingham-forests-clough-era-liverpool
3/20/2022,"Uncertainty and confusion have made an unwelcome intrusion into Chelsea’s world but, for the moment at least, they show no signs of encroaching on to the pitch. As a bewildering raft of prospective buyers waited to learn if they might be handed the keys to Stamford Bridge an amalgam of occasionally ruthless control and measured efficiency propelled Thomas Tuchel’s side into the semi-finals courtesy of goals from Romelu Lukaku and the excellent Hakim Ziyech. Middlesbrough are pushing hard for promotion from the Championship and eliminated Manchester United and Tottenham in earlier rounds but despite some decent passages of intelligent play, Chris Wilder’s side rarely succeeded in unhinging a visiting defence well marshalled by Thiago Silva and Antonio Rüdiger. With Tuchel’s players controlling the tempo, Wilder’s normally cohesive pressing game rarely hit its customary heights and an upset never really seemed feasible. “It was tough to make it look comfortable though,” said Tuchel, who switched his formation to 4-1-4-1 to counter Boro’s press. “Middlesbrough were brave and it was never easy. We never let them get in a foot in the door but our effort was huge. We were very disciplined, very serious and showed quality in decisive moments.” The first arrived in the 14th minute. When Ziyech’s delivery picked out Mason Mount wide on the right, Mount was allowed to advance and unleash a dangerous, beautifully weighted, low cross for the on-rushing Lukaku to sweep into the back of net courtesy of a first time, six yard, shot. After winning their previous nine games at the Riverside Boro were suddenly up against it. Mount, who had a very good game, created Chelsea’s second goal too. As yet another attempt on the part of Wilder’s team to press their guests into submission broke down, a counter-attacking Mount carried the ball forward before playing in Ziyech and watching his fellow attacking midfielder’s left foot do the rest. After cutting inside Neil Taylor, Ziyech marked his 29th birthday by extending that favoured foot and sending an audacious, angled 20-yard shot swerving and dipping beyond the thoroughly deceived Joe Lumley’s outstretched fingertips. “Champions of Europe” chanted the 700 Chelsea fans gathered in the ground’s south-east corner who had purchased tickets before the government imposed sanctions on their club’s outgoing owner Roman Abramovich and thus prevented any further sales of seats to away supporters. Within minutes a crestfallen Lumley was rescued by Anfernee Dijksteel, the defender’s last-ditch, impeccably timed, goal-line clearance denying Lukaku a second goal after the Belgian wrong-footed Wilder’s goalkeeper. Given that Dijksteel impressed in Boro’s back three throughout, making some important interceptions, it seemed rather appropriate that he, albeit briefly, enjoyed a moment in the spotlight. As the sun sank behind the main stand and the sky morphed from blue to dusky pink Édouard Mendy remained a peripheral figure as Wilder’s players struggled to dismantle the formidable barrier constructed by Silva and co. Hard as Isaiah Jones, Boro’s talented right wing-back tried, Chelsea’s defence persistently second guessed even his most inventive manoeuvres. When Wilder’s side finally managed a shot, Jonny Howson fluffed it. Chelsea’s continued resistance to the tactics which have unnerved so many second-tier opponents must have left Boro’s manager wishing the government had not relented in the face of the London club’s pleas for an enhanced travel allowance. Maybe, just maybe, if they had stuck to the original budget and forced Tuchel’s players to travel north by bus rather than fly to Teesside airport they might have exhibited signs of tiredness as dusk descended. Instead Ziyech in particular looked increasingly lively. Wilder’s cause was further hindered by the injuries to two components of his back three which forced the replacement of Dael Fry and then Paddy McNair with the 37-year-old Sol Bamba and the 35-year-old Lee Peltier. Not that Bamba showed his years as his well-timed tackle came between Lukaku and another goal. If only Folarin Balogun, Boro’s Arsenal loanee striker, had shown similar composure after Matt Crooks’s smart backheel flick fooled Malang Sarr and left him with only Mendy to beat. Unable to seize the moment, Balogun sent a shot ballooning over the bar. As Lumley atoned for his arguable culpability in Ziyech’s goal by palming Timo Werner’s header away, Boro fans’ thoughts surely began turning to their hopes of securing a play-off place. Even so their increasingly aggressive side improved as the second half wore on and Mendy needed to react with alacrity to intercept Duncan Watmore’s menacing cross as team-mates jostled to lash it over the line. “It wasn’t one-way traffic and I’m immensely proud of the players and the club for what’s been a terrific cup run,” said Wilder. “But we’re a little bit disappointed. It was a bit of a nearly game for us. We nearly got the press right but if you don’t get it quite right against Chelsea they’ll cut through you. We were playing world class players and didn’t get overrun but Thomas’s team showed their quality in the big moments.”",Sport/Football,Hakim Ziyech sinks Middlesbrough to send Chelsea into FA Cup semi-final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/19/middlesbrough-chelsea-fa-cup-match-report
3/20/2022,"UK authorities have grounded another plane to investigate possible links with Russia, the transport secretary has announced. Russian airlines and private jets are prohibited from landing in the UK and it is a criminal offence for any Russian aircraft to fly or land in the UK. The ban includes any aircraft owned, operated or chartered by anyone connected with Russia or designated individuals or entities on the sanctions list. It also allows the government to detain any aircraft owned by anyone connected with Russia. On Saturday, Grant Shapps tweeted: “Today I have taken rapid action to identify and ground another plane pending inquiries about possible Russian links. We are continuing to take decisive action against Putin and his illegal war in Ukraine.” A source said the government issued a notice to airmen at 10.22am to prevent a flight that is in dispute from taking off from London Biggin Hill Airport. The Cessna Citation Latitude 680A plane, owned by Brooker Holdings Ltd, will remain at the airport while an investigation is undertaken into any potential affiliations with Russia. Last week, the UK impounded a private jet linked to Eugene Shvidler, a billionaire Russian oligarch, on the orders of Shapps. The Luxembourg-registered aircraft flew from the US state of New Jersey into Farnborough airport, Hampshire, on 3 March. The Bombardier Global 6500 jet had been due to fly from the UK to Dubai but UK authorities prevented this while they investigated whether it was permanently leased to Shvidler and fell under UK sanctions. Shapps revoked the plane’s foreign carrier permit, meaning it could not legally carry passengers, and issued a restriction of flying order, in effect grounding the plane.

3/20/2022,"Kanye West has been barred from performing at the Grammy awards next month due to “concerning online behavior”, a representative for the rapper and designer said. The decision, confirmed to Variety, came a day after West, now legally known as Ye, was suspended from Instagram for 24 hours. The platform said content on the 44-year-old’s account was in violation of its policies on “hate speech and bullying and harassment”. Trevor Noah, the comedian and Daily Show host, criticised posts by West about his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian. West responded by using a racial slur. The post was then deleted. West has won 22 Grammys from 75 nominations and is up for five awards this year. But he was not among the first list of performers announced this week. A representative for the singer told the Blast “Kanye’s team isn’t surprised by the decision” to drop him. Kardashian filed for divorce in January 2021 and was declared legally single this month. West has posted numerous messages taunting Kardashian and the comedian Pete Davidson, who is now dating the mother of West’s four children. West has also posted screenshots of messages in which Kardashian says he is “creating a dangerous and scary environment” and says: “Someone will hurt Pete and this will all be your fault.” West has apologised but also continued to post. Last week, West posted that he was “really concerned” Davidson would get Kardashian “hooked on drugs”. “Im [sic] really concerned that [he] will get my kids mom hooked on drugs,” West wrote in an Instagram post. “He’s in rehab every 2 months.” Davidson has acknowledged his use of marijuana. He has also said West should seek help. “Let me help you man. I struggle with mental stuff too,” Davidson reportedly wrote in text messages to West. Noah, who will host the Grammys, shared a nearly 10-minute video detailing his wish for society at large to change how it treats West, Kardashian and Davidson, saying the situation had become “more and more belligerent”. The decision to drop West from the Grammys lineup was not unexpected. But the veteran rapper the Game, who collaborated with West on a recent single with a Davidson-trolling video, Eazy, said: “Time and time again they show us that they only want to STEAL the culture, not allow you to ever be their equals. “In a more than obvious move for reasons of minuscule actions … the Grammys have at the last minute decided to pull [West] from performing on the show as if we didn’t know it was coming.”",Arts/Music,Kanye West barred from Grammys over ‘concerning online behavior’,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/19/kanye-west-grammys-performance-barred-online-behavior
3/20/2022,"As Vladimir Putin stood before a sea of tricolour flags and tens of thousands of applauding Russians in the Luzhniki stadium on Friday, it was clear that he wanted to portray his invasion of Ukraine as a people’s war. Never mind the independent media reports that state employees and university students had been bussed in for the rally, as the government employed the same crude tactics to pack the stadium in order to simulate patriotic enthusiasm as it has done for years. There was still some truth to the elaborate theatre of Friday’s rally. Because inside Russia, both polls and anecdotal evidence indicate, a significant portion of the population has chosen to support the invasion of Ukraine, which must now be referred to by law as a “special operation”. “I support it, practically everyone I know, my friends, all are for it,” said Yegor Gusyev, 35, who manages a vehicle parts business in the Moscow region. “I don’t know anyone who went to a protest against it.” What about the scenes of bombing in Mariupol and Kharkiv and the fact – once unthinkable – of Russia launching an all-out war on its neighbour? “Of course it is sad – I don’t want people to die,” he said. “But there wasn’t any other choice [besides the invasion]… mistakes happen. But I also know the other side is using propaganda against us too. It is all propaganda.” There have been efforts from abroad to encourage the Russian people to protest against the war. Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger last week released a nine-minute video in which he recalled his admiration for the Soviet weightlifter Yuri Vlasov and his father’s shame at fighting for the Nazi army at Leningrad. “This is not the Russian people’s war,” he said in an appeal to ordinary Russians. But others in Russia say it is. Many supporters cite the eight-year-old war between Ukraine and Russian proxy forces in Donbas, using words such as genocide and comparisons to the second world war to justify the invasion. As one former diplomat wrote in a WhatsApp message, he looks forward to Russia holding a “Nuremberg 2.0” in Ukraine after the war. “Aren’t you sad for the children killed in Donbas?” Elizaveta from Moscow shot back when asked about her views on the invasion. “Why don’t you write about them instead?” Russian society is deeply polarised between supporters and opponents of the Kremlin. Those camps have carried this division over into support for and opposition to the war, experts said. Even simple choices such as whether to call the conflict a “war” or the state-sanctioned “military operation” carry political meaning. “We are seeing that society is divided by a majority that broadly supports the war and a minority that is against it,” said Sergei Belanovsky, a sociologist. “These two groups live in different worlds, and cannot convince each other that their viewpoint is the right one.” According to the state-run Russian Public Opinion Research Center, 71% of Russians “support Russia’s decision to hold a special military operation in Ukraine”. Valery Fyodorov, head of the polling centre, said that new data to be published by the centre this week would show an increase in support for the “military operation”. There has been scepticism about those results because they reinforce the Kremlin-backed image of a popular war. But Denis Volkov of the independent Levada Center also endorsed the data, saying that the results from state-run pollsters are “in my opinion entirely credible”. The Levada Centre, which is Russia’s main independent pollster, has not released a poll of public opinion on the war since the conflict began. Plans to publish results of an earlier poll were scrapped by the centre’s employees because of concerns that their results would “in some way promote the intensification of the conflict”. Volkov said the group is now conducting a new poll. Some, however, have questioned the logic of polling public opinion in a country where information about the war is carefully curated by state television. “State propaganda works – it is extremely effective in what it does, presenting the events as a special military operation against the Ukrainian Nazis. A lot of key information is being withheld,” said Belanovsky. Others have said that Russians are simply afraid to tell pollsters they are opposed to the war. “Conducting surveys in authoritarian countries is tricky. Respondents in Russia believe surveys are conducted by the government. Especially during wartime, respondents, they will be less likely to feel open to talk,” said Grigory Yudin, a sociologist. Yudin said that, according to his research, fewer Russians were willing to speak with pollsters since the beginning of the war, with only 25% of those approached now willing to answer questions on Ukraine, compared with 33% when the invasion started. Yudin added: “Based on my own ideas, I believe a much smaller group is actively in favour of war, actively militarised. That group does exist and it is a worrisome group but it is not the majority.” Aggressive efforts to generate support for the invasion have left opponents of the war aghast. When Putin appeared on Friday, a banner calling “For a world without Nazism” bore the letter Z, a tactical marking used on Russian tanks in Ukraine. Anti-war activists have also found the letter graffitied in white paint on their doorways in an effort to intimidate them. “Personally, in my opinion, it’s fascism, something I never imagined would happen … I don’t have any other association than that,” said Daniil Beilinson of the OVD-Info group, which has monitored the arrest of nearly 15,000 protesters and other pressures faced by anti-war activists. There has been little of the organic surge in patriotism that marked Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Until Friday, which marked the eighth anniversary of the annexation, the Kremlin had not held mass rallies in support of its war, and many Russians have started focusing on the growing economic crisis rather than the military conflict itself. “If we try to compare the mood of 2014 and now, then the support has remained but the euphoria has disappeared,” said Volkov. “There is no joy.” But the unprecedented sanctions introduced by the west that could shrink the country’s GDP by as much as 20% have not turned the population against the Kremlin. “For now, sanctions actually have an opposite impact. Pointing to the sanctions, the authorities have been effective in convincing Russians that a ‘hostile’ west is acting against their interest,” explained Belanovsky. While the Russian rouble has already sunk to record lows, experts have argued it will take months before ordinary Russians feel the full force of the sanctions. “But the mood could be totally different in two, three months if the economy does actually crumple as some economists have predicted. Then Russians might start asking questions to Putin,” the sociologist said.",News/World news,Vladimir Putin waves the flag in a polarised country where views are hard to shift,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/vladimir-putin-waves-the-flag-in-a-polarised-country-where-views-are-hard-to-shift
3/20/2022,"“Flying by the seat of my pants.” This is how Sydney pop artist Thomas Porter describes the lead-up to his first ever live show. The 24-year-old musician signed with independent label Dew Process just as the pandemic hit, released an EP on Friday and has no idea if he’s going to be able to turn his bedroom music into a live show – or if anyone will come to hear it. “I’m terrified,” Porter says. “There’s been two years of hype at this point. I’ve never performed any of these songs.” Porter is one of the musicians dubbed “Covid babies” by the industry. They were signed or got big during the pandemic, but are lacking that live performance experience most up-and-coming acts have. Some artists – like pop musician Flynn Sant, who goes by Flowerkid – even have millions of plays on Spotify and YouTube and tens of thousands of engaged fans on social media. The Warner Music signed 20-year-old is on the bill for Splendour in the Grass and this week performed his first ever live show at The Great Club in Marrickville. He says it’s weird “being online and being recognised as a musician”, but not having the live music chops to back it up. Flynn was so nervous before going on stage that he threw up. But the butterflies didn’t last. “As soon as I got out there and started, I was like ‘yep, this is where I’m meant to be’ and I just kept going no matter how many little things I stuffed up,” he says. “I didn’t care as much for this silly little details, but rather the vibe and it felt great and everybody was cheering. It was incredible.” Canberra rapper Seaton Rogers, who performs under the name YNG Martyr, also got his first big live moment earlier this month. “It was a 50-50 mix of ‘this is happening’ and then ‘oh shit, this is happening’,” he says, still buzzing from the set days later. After years of making music and practising it at home, the 22-year-old Wiradjuri man is finally getting his chance to see if his success online was going to translate in real life. Rogers had moderate success until right before the first lockdown of 2020 when his song Nike Ticks “literally blew up”. He watched the number of listens tick up from his bedroom and wanted to get out there and perform. “There were points where I tried to launch tours, I was so, so set on it, tickets had been sold. And then it was, ‘nup, borders are closed, everything’s off’,” he says. He tried to make the most of it, knowing the ears and eyes on him online presented an “insane opportunity”. “I had to figure out ways to capitalise on it in my bedroom,” he says. And he did – with about 1.5m listens on Spotify each month and tens of thousands of followers, he worked on his image and marketing, and kept his fingers crossed that when he was able to go on stage, there were people on the other side listening. “It was so hard for me to see that what I’ve done online could translate into real life because I physically never got to see it, never got to play a show or meet up with fans,” he says. “I was sitting there like I have online buzz but where is it? I am still living in the exact same way. I felt like I had this thing but it was just out of reach.” He bought a cheap mic, plugged it into his computer at home and had been practising for whenever the moment came – which it did at This That festival in Queensland. “It didn’t really click in my head until like an hour before I was performing that this was gonna happen, there’s no way out of this now, but it was great,” he says. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It’s a lot different when you’re out there and jumping around and there’s a massive stage. It’s starting to finally feel like a real tangible thing.” For Porter, the wait is still on. He had a show planned for right before Christmas, but it was cancelled – like so many others – as Omicron kicked off. He hopes to book another show to celebrate the release of Manic Pixie Dream Girl. But with two years of postponed shows across the city, finding a spare stage is proving tricky. Dew Process A&R manager Harry Young says it is becoming an issue for lots of the artists in the same boat. “Tours have been postponed so much and there’s lots of smaller acts that are crying for those same venues,” he says. “A lot of venues are talking about how they are already booked the whole year.” Young has always used social media as a way to find new talent but without then being able to go watch people live as well, it has been harder to work out who has what it takes to make it as a performing musician. “You can have millions of streams on a song but some things don’t transfer as well to a live show,” he said. “You can’t see if people can connect to your songs the same way when it’s not live.” And for most artists in Australia, performing live is incredibly important to make it a viable career. “We make music for the passion of it, but I’m in my 20s, I do need a bit of money if I want to pay my rent,” Porter says. “Not having that is really, really scary. It’s the difference between me living a very tenuous life and barely keeping my head above water versus being a proper flourishing creative.” Porter knows he has a tough road ahead but he is excited. “There’s really no substitute for having time in front of crowds,” Porter says. “I want to dance. I want to jump around or roll around. I want to go into the crowd. I want to do everything.”",Arts/Music,‘I’m terrified’: music’s ‘Covid babies’ take to the stage for the first time,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/20/im-terrified-musics-covid-babies-take-to-the-stage-for-the-first-time
3/20/2022,"Sydneysiders are being urged to exercise caution when returning to swim in the city’s beaches and waterways after weeks of torrential rain and flooding. Sediment and debris swept downstream by heavy rain turned Sydney Harbour brown last week, with swimmers warned to avoid the water. With a few sunny days forecast to provide some respite in the coming week, how can you tell whether it’s safe to return for a dip? The New South Wales government’s Beachwatch program advises people avoid swimming at ocean beaches for one day after heavy rainfall, or for as long as storm water is present. For more sheltered harbour areas and bays, the suggested wait time stretches to three days. The most obvious signs of storm water and flood water pollution to look for are discolouration of the water, and debris both floating in the water and washing up on the tide line. A spokesperson for Beachwatch said flood waters were still flowing into the ocean from the Hawkesbury River, Sydney Harbour and Botany Bay, “turning the ocean brown from the Central Coast to Wollongong and up to 8km out to sea”. Floodwaters are still flowing into the ocean from the Hawkesbury River, Sydney Harbour and Botany Bay turning the ocean brown. Signs of pollution seen while collecting water samples from Sydney Harbour today. pic.twitter.com/iW7K8DkN4I Forecasts issued on Friday advised of possible pollution at Sydney’s ocean and harbour beaches. Daily forecasts are available on the Beachwatch website. Prof Stuart Khan, a water quality expert and the director of the graduate school of engineering at the University of NSW, said the Beachwatch guidance was based on “more than a decade of water quality monitoring and understanding of how the beaches are impacted by rainfall”. Swimming in polluted water is a health risk due to the pathogens from raw sewage, Khan said. “When it rains in big cities like Sydney, water gets into our sewers, because the sewers are not sealed.” The sewers are designed to overflow in cases of extreme rain, running into storm water pipes that discharge directly into open waterways, instead of being directed to sewage treatment plants. “Therefore you have all of the pathogenic microorganisms that you would associate with raw sewage: bacteria, viruses as well, and protozoan organisms like cryptosporidium and giardia,” Khan said. Exposure to these microorganisms can result in gastroenteritis, and ear and skin infections. “The threat with those sorts of organisms is short term because most of them don’t survive well in the environment,” Khan said. Given how extreme the recent rainfall has been, he suggests exercising caution and waiting for even longer than the guidelines recommend. “For something like this where the whole system is flushed, I think you’d want to be pretty careful and leave a bit of extra time,” agreed Phillip Birtles, the integrated water cycle manager for Sydney Water. “Even as microbial levels return to normal there still may be a large amount of debris or other hazards, such as murky water, which should be considered,” said a Beachwatch spokesperson. Experts have previously warned beachgoers to avoid swimming in murky water due the risk of shark encounters following weeks of heavy rain. Earlier this month, the NSW Department of Primary Industries said turbid water “can make conditions ideal for ambush predators, like sharks, to hunt in”. “Run-off and nutrients from the land run into our waterways and can attract fish and other animals to feed – this can then attract sharks,” a DPI spokesperson said. Storm water can be surprisingly detrimental to both freshwater and saltwater environments, Khan said. During heavy rainfall, organic carbon matter – such as leaves and sticks – is transported through storm water systems into waterways. Once there, bacteria biodegrade these materials, consuming oxygen in the process. “When there are low oxygen concentrations in water, that’s when … fish suffocate,” Khan said. “There have been a number of reports of significant fish kills around NSW following the floods we had a couple of weeks ago.” An increase in dissolved carbon compounds can also darken the water, leading to “blackwater events”. The good news, says Birtles, is that water quality in the tributaries of Sydney Harbour has been improving since the 1970s – the result of stricter regulations and a reduction in industry along the foreshore. “We’ve got a whole lot of mangroves and oysters coming back,” he said. “In general, the biodiversity is improving and we’re seeing dolphins and whales and seals moving back into the harbour.” Modelling shows that as the city’s population density increases, “we could go backwards”, Birtles said. “As we get more development occurring in the catchment, more hard surfaces, there is risk that that will deliver more pollutants more efficiently to the waterway.” He emphasises the need for well-designed storm water systems, and says Sydney Water is working with local councils to open new swimming sites along the Parramatta River.",News/Australia news,After the deluge: is it safe to get back in the water in Sydney?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/20/after-the-deluge-is-it-safe-to-get-back-in-the-water-in-sydney

In one case, a homeowner had returned to their property which had been condemned for demolition after being assessed as structurally unsound, and had warning tape erected at its entrance, however they did not want to be interviewed. Some homes in South Lismore were swept off their foundations, but they remained intact, despite needing renovations and structural repairs. Stories of residents living in unsafe housing follow revelations in Guardian Australia that motor homes intended for Lismore residents whose houses were inundated in the floods were lying empty because linen and water sources had not been organised, while housing “pods” promised by the NSW government were yet to materialise. On Crown Street, the Lee family’s home was deemed uninhabitable after flooding rose to about chest height on its elevated top floor. The family of four hosted four neighbours on the Sunday that waters rose, and all eight had to be rescued by a friend who had a boat on Monday 28 February. After evacuating, brothers Ryan and Evan have slept at a variety of places, including at their grandparents’ home and on friends’ couches. Their parents also leaned on family and friends for accommodation. While they were able to rely on people who opened their homes to them, countless other residents also required temporary accommodation. And so on Monday, after weeks of living in cramped conditions with other flood evacuees, the Lee family made the difficult decision to return to their home, despite its status as uninhabitable. “There was nowhere else left to go, that is the only reason why we’re back here,” said Evan, a 20-year-old student, who was sleeping on an old fold-out camping bed made of steel, less than a metre from his mother, who was sleeping on a blow-up mattress. Ryan, a 21-year-old labourer, was sleeping on a swag in the next room, while their father, Andy, was sleeping at his brother’s house due to a back problem. While water was running, the Lees were unsure if it was safe, so were drinking bottled water. The house relied on a portable generator for electricity, and its mountain of flood-ruined possessions in the front yard was yet to be collected. “I’ve got no idea when it will be collected, but hopefully it’s within the next week because it’s starting to smell pretty bad,” Ryan said. Outside, the smell of dried dirt and sewage lingered. Inside, water damage and mould was evident. It was hot inside the rooms, and flood damage left it largely unprotected from the elements. The family had been told it would take more than six months for their home to be rebuilt and safe for them to move back in. Despite this, Andy said one benefit of the fact they had returned to the home was that they could protect against looters looking to steal donated goods, such as fridges and washing machines, that had already arrived at some homes. The family were desperate for more secure medium-term accommodation and frustrated at the current options available to them. They had attempted to apply for one of the 40 mobile homes the state government delivered to Lismore for flood-affected victims, but had not heard back from the government.

Anywhere really,” Ryan said. Along their street and those intersecting, the story was similar. Piles of possessions remained uncollected at most homes, and stories of families forced to return were common.

However, he counted the family as fortunate, as they had an insurance policy in place. “We really are some of the lucky ones in a way,” he said.",News/Australia news,Flood-affected Lismore residents with nowhere to go return to homes deemed uninhabitable,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/20/flood-affected-lismore-residents-with-nowhere-to-go-return-to-homes-deemed-uninhabitable
3/20/2022,"Planners are calling for a shake-up of their industry and the planning system in the wake of the devastating floods across south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales. As flood waters rose across Brisbane, Brent O’Neill, the director of design at Wolter Consulting, logged on to his computer and asked: “As development professionals, what is our responsibility to ensure we do not put people’s lives and property at risk? “I cannot help but reflect on the numerous times that as professional planners and engineers we continually push councils on the development footprint and boundaries, proposing engineered solutions to significant hydrological issues, ultimately rewarded by our developer clients when we achieve higher densities, or development in flood prone areas,” O’Neill wrote on LinkedIn. O’Neill told the Guardian that the aftermath of the floods was an ideal time to question “the ethical obligation of planners and the development industry”. “Ultimately, we’re there to represent community needs and values and if we’re not doing this, we need to do better,” he says. The planner and academic Dr Laurel Johnson says the planning industry needs to return to its roots. “The health of individuals and communities is at the heart of modern planning practice, which grew from a response to the dreadful health outcomes in post–Industrial Revolution European cities,” Johnson says. “But we’ve moved from that really clear mission of planning in the public interest to become facilitators and enablers of development.” Johnson says the planning industry needs to “pause and recalibrate”, given the dire warnings contained in last month’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. The IPCC says unchecked climate change will dramatically increase the frequency of deadly flooding to several times a year and will cause sea levels rise to the point where, in some coastal areas, retreat is the only option. Johnson says if her industry does not advocate for the public interest, communities will lose the chance to decide their future. “What’s happening now is that insurance companies are determining this because there are some areas where it’s not feasible to rebuild.” O’Neill and Johnson say the planning issues that have manifested after the recent floods are reflective of broader problems within the system. Johnson says the planning system is overly complex. “There’s even a Planning Institute of Australia award called the Hard Won Victory, as if beating the planning system is to be awarded,” she says. O’Neill says while the adversarial system could “produce excellent innovation, we do have to be cautious if that it is creating bad outcomes”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “An example is where you have two technical arguments, where one says the site will flood, and another says it won’t. We end up with two experts arguing about flood modelling, which might not produce an ideal outcome.” He says Brisbane city council planning rules introduced after the 2011 floods required development applicants to provide technical reports to show their proposed project won’t flood. However, O’Neill says Queensland’s performance-based Planning Act means developments on flood-prone sites can still be approved with some risk.

However, he says state and local governments need to rethink laws around building on flood plains, as planners alone cannot be moral gatekeepers. The Queensland deputy premier and planning minister, Steven Miles, said at a media conference this month he planned to talk to councils about how they could change their planning schemes to cope with the projections for more frequent and more severe natural disasters: “I have visited flooded areas … that, frankly, should not have been built upon.” Miles said the government and councils needed to work together to “mitigate flooding risks ... but also ensure that going forward we’re not building new homes on locations that are prone to flooding .” Sri says the impact of the floods on the low-lying suburb of Rocklea, where the city’s produce markets were inundated and a major garbage-truck depot was isolated by flood waters, shows council needs to rethink zoning laws . “We’ve got impacts to power, to sewerage, to school facilities, to waste disposal, to the food supply chains,” he says. Sri says governments have to take responsibility for the impact of the floods. A Brisbane city council spokesperson says: “An independent review into Brisbane’s preparedness for floods is being undertaken by former governor Paul de Jersey. We will publish the report and respond to its recommendations once it is finalised.” Sri says new rules need to look “at the cumulative impact of just how much development there has been, not just in low-lying flood areas but in areas higher on the hill”. “We don’t just need to be talking about the amount of development within creek catchments and within creek flood plains, but we actually need to be talking about the amount of development up the hills where the proliferation of concrete and hard-stand surfaces means that water hits those sites and then runs straight down,” Sri says. Sri, Johnson and O’Neill agree governments need to buy back flood-prone land. Sri says: “In suburbs such as Rocklea and Fairfield, the western side of West End, and the low-lying parts of Milton and Auchenflower, the government needs to offer optional buybacks to all residents in low-lying areas around creeks and the river and preserve that as green space or sports fields or other land uses that aren’t as severely affected by flooding.” He says: “The government should also be compulsorily acquiring any sites in these areas where developers are proposing to develop new residential, industrial or commercial buildings.” By promoting development on flood-prone land, O’Neill says governments are increasing the likely risks of flooding, ultimately placing the ongoing costs “back to the private sector, both owners and developers”. He says it is time for the industry to engage with all levels of government to have a hard discussion about priorities. “It’s about saying we’re a river city and we are facing a $1bn bill to rectify the recent damages.”",News/Australia news,"Queensland floods raise questions about the ‘ethical obligation of planners’, industry figures say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/20/queensland-floods-raise-questions-about-the-ethical-obligation-of-planners-industry-figures-say
3/20/2022,"Ian Mineall was listening to talkback radio on Tuesday morning when he learned of a fire at a boarding house on Probert Street, Newtown, in Sydney’s inner west. “I know two boarding houses on that street,” he says. He hoped it wasn’t his old place. “It was.” The shocking inferno at the 14-room Vadja House left three people dead. Eight residents managed to escape, including one 80-year-old man who was in a critical condition after jumping out of a window before having a heart attack. Police have since charged a former resident with three counts of murder and one count of destroying or damaging property by fire or explosive. The owner of the property has not been accused of any wrongdoing and is not facing charges. Advocates say the tragedy has once again placed the spotlight on the plight of those living in what are often dilapidated, unsafe homes. Boarding house residents share a kitchen and living space, rarely have their own bathroom, and for these reasons are technically considered homeless by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. But because rooms cater to individuals who may struggle to gain a lease in a private rental, prices can actually be above market rates. “Boarding houses are at the end of the day only ever an option B,” says the Shelter NSW chief executive, John Engeler. “They’re better than the alternative, rough sleeping, but they’re not an [option] A.” Most residents tend to be older men like Mineall. And like Mineall, about a third are on the disability pension, according to Homelessness NSW chief executive Katherine McKernan, who argues most people are only living in boarding houses due to the “dearth of social housing”. “Sometimes they have an intellectual disability or another disability that makes it difficult for them to advocate for themselves, so they can be exploited,” says McKernan. Paul Adabie, of the Newtown Neighbourhood Centre, which provides in-reach social services to many boarding house residents in the area, says boarding houses “vary a great deal in quality”. The centre’s chief executive, Liz Yeo, also underlines this point. “It’s not a sector you can paint with one brush,” says Yeo, whose organisation is widely praised for the work it does with operators to improve conditions. Mineall lived at the Newtown boarding house from 1989 to 2018. He served as the caretaker, meaning he got a “bit off the rent”. He was also responsible for “collecting the rents, doing a bit of cleaning”, and was sometimes required to inform people they were being evicted. He was sometimes threatened when he did so, he says. Mineall says the house had “deteriorated a bit” since he left, though he acknowledged repairs had been done on multiple occasions. Yeo described conditions at the property as “terrible”. One issue Mineall pointed to was “a hole in the kitchen roof”. “Nearly every time it rained the water would build up and go over to the kitchen and a few bits of stuff would come down,” he says. Guardian Australia does not suggest the condition of the home was a factor in the fatal fire. The Inner West council has confirmed the property had a current fire compliance certificate. In 2012, NSW introduced the Boarding Houses Act, which created a compulsory register and laws governing the rights and responsibilities of occupants and proprietors. McKernan says the legislation itself is “relatively good”. “The issue is it is not enforced”. “The register hovers around 1,000 boarding houses but we think a lot are unregistered,” says Yeo. The Newtown property ravaged by fire was registered with the government. Another key problem is there is insufficient incentive for local councils to act as a watchdog, say experts. “Local councils are responsible for regulating but any fines etc go to the state government,” says McKernan. “What that means is local government have to invest a lot to regulate and they don’t get any recompense for that. What we’re then relying on is the goodwill … of the councils.” Chris Martin, a housing policy expert at UNSW, says some are also mindful that closing a place down can mean “making a group of people homeless”. Martin would like to see an accreditation regime to regulate who can operate boarding houses. The idea was floated in an ongoing review of the Boarding Houses Act, which is being overhauled to include other similar settings as the “Shared Accomodation Act”. Martin says it has not been picked up by government. “[Boarding house operators] are involved in managing relations between multiple people in shared space, which calls for a higher order of skill and capability than individual landlords,” Martin says. “And also it is a sector that caters to a relatively vulnerable clientele.” Adabie also backed the idea of a licensing regime, while Engeler, of Shelter NSW, believes only community housing providers should have rights to run boarding houses. Martin also notes the state government discontinued the Boarding House Financial Assistance Program in 2019, which included a specific part of that program on fire safety upgrades. While many outsiders consider boarding houses to be problematic, Newtown Neighbourhood Centre research has found many residents are relatively satisfied. Many judged others as worse off than themselves. “You’d be surprised,” says Adabie. “Even with this fire [in Newtown], people don’t want to go to housing, they want to stay in the boarding house sector because of their history.” Mineall describes his experience as “at times stressful, at times not too bad”. “There was often a sense of community,” he says. But other times it was tough. “Some of the people would leave their homes in a horrific mess,” he says. “The mess is one thing I really do remember. I had the job of cleaning up that mess.” Mineall adds that he had “easily the best room the house” and insisted he got a “pretty good deal”. He still wants to see more regulation of the sector. “I really think boarding houses should be inspected a bit more often,” he says. “There should be more stringent rules applied.” Mineall is now in a home run by Anglicare, which he says he much prefers. It is still a shared property, but there are staff on hand to help the residents. If it weren’t for the social housing shortage, though, he might have his own place. About five years ago he enquired about social housing at an office in Broadway and “was told it was a 15-year wait”. “I looked at the calendar, and I thought, ‘Fifteen years, I’m going to be 75 by the time I get into housing commission,’” he says. “So I pulled the pin on that pretty quick.”",News/Australia news,Newtown boarding house fire puts spotlight on conditions for vulnerable residents across sector,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/20/better-than-sleeping-rough-newtown-boarding-house-fire-puts-spotlight-on-sector
3/20/2022,"Flying flags in support of aromantic people; an investigation into how to ban nuclear weapons; a plan to grow and sell medicinal cannabis; street signs with anti-racism slogans, and a motion in support of Palestine on the same day that terrorist group Hamas fired more than 150 rockets into Israel. The mantra “roads, rates and rubbish” once defined the purpose of local governments. But in recent years, many of Victoria’s 79 councils have been advocating on issues that – on the surface, at least – are somewhat removed from the core business of councils. Many ratepayers and residents have welcomed this advocacy with open arms, happy that their elected representatives are standing up for their communities and speaking up on issues, especially those that their state and federal counterparts may shy away from. Others disagree, calling it a waste of money and resources that could be better spent on much-needed services, such as libraries, maternal and child health, and support for local small businesses. Kathryn Arndt is chief executive officer of the Victorian Local Governance Association, and is accustomed to this cycle of support and outrage that the increasing politicisation of councils generate. “Any issue that a council does get involved in should be done so only as it is consistent with their own municipal health and wellbeing plan, and consistent with any community sentiment or wish, and that issue is important to their community,” she says. “I think there’s a misunderstanding about what councils actually do.” The Victorian Local Government Act 1989 stated that councils should advocate on issues that were important to their communities. The act was superseded by the 2020 version, which removed this section. “The new act [says] more about the role of the council to provide good governance for the wellbeing and the benefit of the community,” Arndt explains. “This is something that is also not very well understood by a lot of people and that is, unlike any other level of government, a group of councillors are actually required to govern the business of the council.” Local government collectively in Victoria is a $9bn machine, with each council providing on average about 140 services, ranging from roads to aged care facilities. Many services have been delegated to them by the federal and state governments. At the same time, both levels of government have cut funding to councils for more than a decade, through cost-shifting and a drop in grants. This has placed increasing financial pressure on local governments, which they have – in part – counteracted with hiking up rates, which are calculated based on property prices. And despite an Andrews government cap on rates to CPI – which this year will be 1.75% – some ratepayers continue to be faced with whopping increases of up to 18%. Verity Webb, spokeswoman for the Victorian Ratepayers Association, says that given the financial pressures many councils face, they should focus on their core business and reining in costs, rather than speaking out on political issues that have little to do with their day-to-day activities. “Most councils are broke. Wage bills are outrageous and while ratepayers were losing jobs and income, some councils were hiring staff and [providing] pay rises,” Webb says. “The reason councils get involved in politics is because we have councillors who have nothing better to do than waste time and money dabbling in pet projects.” She added that too many councillors “waste time and money trying to catch the attention of state and federal power brokers by jumping on popular bandwagons”. But Stephen Jolly, a five-term Socialist councillor with Yarra City Council, says there isn’t a “Berlin Wall” between what is a local, state or federal issue. “One of the big issues I deal with is public housing; 13% of Yarra’s population live in public housing and they are overwhelmingly low-income and non-white,” he says. “Now, that’s a state issue, but they have burning life-and-death issues every day, so we openly campaign to improve and extend public housing and social housing. “You could technically say, ‘well, that’s not a council issue’, and you’d be right. But we’d be writing off the poorest and most vulnerable people in our community. It’s just not as clean-cut as some people argue.” Jolly points out that Yarra was the first Victorian council to cease acknowledging or celebrating Australia Day, in 2017, for which it received a significant backlash in the media. And while the cause remains controversial, it has unquestionably garnered further momentum in recent years. The right likes to rail against what the Institute of Public Affairs director of policy Gideon Rozner called the “loopy rules” and “virtue signalling” of councils. “From foreign policy, to climate, to dictating what food people are allowed to sell at food trucks, local councils are increasingly becoming fiefdoms where power-hungry local representatives are taking on responsibilities that should be reserved for state or federal governments,’ he said. But Arndt says issues like LGBTIQ+, reconciliation and the climate crisis are important ones for councils to focus on. “There are demographics within municipality communities that are at risk and that do require support to ensure their health and wellbeing,” she says. “Those who are criticising don’t understand the responsibilities of councils and are looking at councils in a very narrow way.”",News/Australia news,"Council of war: how much should local government stray from roads, rates and rubbish?",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/20/council-of-war-how-much-should-local-government-stray-from-roads-rates-and-rubbish
3/20/2022,"When Nannette Knapp’s son was 13 years old, he received a kidney transplant. He’d suffered from kidney disease since he was three, and had been on dialysis for years. The transplant was a big deal in the small community of Albany, Western Australia, where the family lives. It featured on the local news, and was even mentioned by then local member, Peter Watson, in the state’s lower house of parliament during a debate on council amalgamations. “Young Cody Knapp received a kidney transplant,” Watson said, while extolling the virtues of his electorate. “He is now living the life of a normal 13-year-old boy.” Except their lives were anything but normal. Soon after the transplant, after the cameras had been put away and the politicians had shifted their focus, things took a sharp turn. The assistance dried up, debts began piling up, and Knapp was eventually forced to leave the public housing property they lived in, before being formally evicted. Knapp’s eviction, and the debt that came with it, triggered nearly a decade of homelessness and despair. Her story is one of hard-won resilience and a desire to fight against tremendous odds: the systemic poverty instigated and perpetuated by what her advocates describe as punitive government policy. For years Knapp was a full-time carer for Cody, managing his dialysis at their home rented from the WA Housing Authority, while also caring for her other four children. When the transplant finally came, it helped his quality of life immensely, but Cody still required ongoing care – including medication and refrigerated dietary supplements. Knapp was subsisting on welfare payments, as she could not work due to a back injury. She had help managing the utility bills while her son was on dialysis, but after his transplant, the help dried up and the debt began compounding. By the time the power was cut off, Knapp had accrued an electricity bill of nearly $7,000. Later, her advocates and the power company would struggle to discern how the bills got so high without any intervention. It was impossible to care for her vulnerable son in a house without power, so Knapp went to stay with her daughter. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Soon afterwards, Knapp was evicted for non-payment of rent. The Housing Authority conducted a post-rental inspection and raised a debt of $26,096.92 against her, predominantly for damage, which Knapp says she did not cause. Until she had paid off the debt, she was told, she would not be eligible for another house. She did not believe she would be able to pay it off, as her only income was Centrelink payments – some of the lowest welfare payments in the OECD. The double burden of eviction and debt triggered a period of extreme distress for Knapp. She left her younger children with her adult daughter and disappeared into despair. “I just mainly gave up,” she says. “I had a drinking problem and anxiety on top of it. As long as the boys were right, I didn’t care. I went down a spiral, right down.” This had not been her first traumatic experience with government authorities. As a child in a Noongar/Yamatji family, she and her siblings were wrenched from their parents and sent to missions and foster carers. Knapp doesn’t speak much about what she endured during that time, only to say: “I was one of the stolen generation children. So I didn’t have time to spend time with my parents. When I got out [of foster care], I had a year or two with them, and then they were gone.” After her mother died, the bailiff came to evict Knapp and her siblings from her mother’s public housing property before the funeral had even been conducted. So years later, when she was evicted again, it took Knapp a long time to pull herself out of her spiral. “I just woke up to myself and thought, I gotta get my kids back and do something about it,” she says. “One thing we didn’t do was give them to welfare. After what we went though, I wouldn’t let that happen to them.” WA housing advocate Betsy Buchanan has known Nannette Knapp for decades, assisting her case with appeals to the WA Department of Communities. There are currently 18,388 households registered on the WA public housing waitlist, but Buchanan believes these figures are a distorted representation of need, because they do not include the number of former tenants who, like Knapp, have accrued debts that prevent them from accessing further public housing. “Aboriginal people can’t compete in the private market. They often have a lot of trauma or they’re looking after extra kids. They’ve got very poor health and hardly have any money,” Buchanan says. “It’s a discriminatory system. It discriminates against Aboriginal people at every turn. You can’t ‘try hard’ against those odds.” In one of many letters to the WA Department of Communities on behalf of Knapp, Buchanan wrote: “It is my belief that the enormous debts raised by the department against the poorest people in our community are an unjust and discriminatory bar to Aboriginal access to housing.” Guardian Australia has separately spoken to numerous Aboriginal people living homeless in Western Australia. Debt to the Housing Authority is a frequent complaint. Those who are barred from access to housing thanks to such debt often lodge with other family members who have existing public housing tenancies, leading to overcrowding. The overcrowding increases the likelihood of damages to the property or neighbour complaints against the tenant, which in turn increases the likelihood of further debt or eviction. Eligibility for public housing is already restricted to those on the lowest of incomes, and repayment plans for these debts – required in many cases for prospective tenants to become eligible again – diminish already meagre incomes even further. The situation of tenants is made even more precarious by the Housing Authority’s controversial disruptive behaviour management policy, known as the “three strikes” policy, which allows them to evict tenants who have had three strike notices issued against them. An audit of the policy in 2018 found that “a more holistic approach to tenancy management is needed if the department is to reduce disruptive behaviour incidents from occurring in the first place.” The WA Department of Communities told Guardian Australia that as of 28 February 2022, there were 15,316 current public housing tenancy accounts in debt to the Housing Authority. Last financial year, there were 35,279 public housing dwellings in WA, which suggests there is debt attached to at least 43% people holding public housing tenancies in the state. At the same time, 8,842 former tenants also have a debt to the Housing Authority. The average debt for a former tenant was $4,936. The primary causes of debt, according to Communities, were non-payment of rent, non-payment of utility bills and costs charged for removal of rubbish following vacation of a tenancy. A spokesperson from Communities says that Knapp was engaged with support programs throughout her tenancy that were aimed to “increase the capacity of a tenant to independently sustain their tenancy”. Last year, with the assistance of advocates, Knapp appealed her debt. On 17 November 2021, that appeal was upheld and vacated tenant liability charges of $20,519.90 were waived. The tribunal’s decision was not made on an empathetic basis; the finding cited only the failure of housing authorities to abide by an administrative obligation in the Tenancies Act. Now 53 years old and a grandmother, Knapp is still swimming against a relentless tide. She still owes the Housing Authority more than $4,000 in rental arrears, utilities and other charges, which her advocates estimate will take her seven years to pay. Her only income is jobseeker, which is fraught with administrative burdens as she is constantly having to prove that her back injury prevents her from working. Even if she could work, she says, how could she be expected to find a job without a permanent home? “You can’t look for work if you haven’t got a house to go back to. I can’t work for my health reasons and mobility. I was told I could study online but I don’t have a computer. And I am just so poor,” she says. Last year Knapp was advised that she has been allowed back onto the public housing waitlist and has been given a priority listing. So far, though, she has not received a house. “People need to know what they’re doing to us,” she says. “I thought it was just awful when Cody was just sick. Why did they throw us out when Cody still needed home care? The government need to be accountable. Haven’t you guys really got a heart?”",News/Australia news,Aboriginal people in WA’s public housing system are fighting against a relentless tide of ‘punitive policy’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/20/aboriginal-people-in-was-public-housing-system-are-fighting-against-a-relentless-tide-of-punitive-policy
3/20/2022,"The European Union is under pressure to ban the import of kangaroo products following a push from a Dutch animal rights party, a move that if successful could collapse the kangaroo export market. Europe is the largest market for kangaroo meat and leather products. But animal rights activists say that the trade is incompatible with the EU’s animal welfare requirements, and are building opposition to kangaroo products ahead of the EU-Australia free trade agreement. It follows a push to ban the import of kangaroo leather to the US. Legislation to stop the import of kangaroo products was introduced to congress last year but has not progressed. The push to ban kangaroo imports has been led by the Dutch Party for Animals, which is allied with the Animal Justice party in Australia. In 2018 it hosted a screening of an anti-kangaroo hunting film in The Hague, and also hosted New South Wales Animal Justice party MP Mark Pearson, who addressed a group of about 80 people in the European parliament. Last month the Dutch parliament passed a motion from Party for the Animals MP Frank Wassenberg calling on the government to “address the problem of access to the European market of controversial products such as kangaroo meat and kangaroo products with the European Commission.” Agriculture minister Henk Staghouwer supported the motion, saying that he “shares the concerns expressed” about the commercial kangaroo harvest, but warning that progress on a ban may be slow because it has to comply with trade regulations. The department of foreign affairs defended the commercial kangaroo industry and said Australia was “negotiating a free trade agreement with the EU that will remove barriers to trade, not put more restrictions on exporters”. All animal products imported to the EU from Australia must be produced in a manner that complies with Australian animal welfare standards and EU import requirements. The EU regularly audits the products, most recently in 2019, and found they met all requirements. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning About 1.5m wild kangaroos are killed in commercial harvesting operations in Australia each year, although the number can vary due to demand and drought. The target species are eastern grey, western grey, and red kangaroos and common wallaroos, none of which are listed as threatened species and all of which are considered abundant. States and territories set annual quotas for the number of kangaroos that can be harvested, which can be up to 20% of the kangaroos in a given region, but the actual number taken is much lower. The department of agriculture, water and the environment estimates that 3% of the country’s 50m kangaroos are used in meat production each year. The harvesting is undertaken at night by commercial shooters, who are required to pass accuracy and competency tests and to kill with a single shot to the brain. The carcasses are then eviscerated and prepared for transport, which frequently involves removing the head. They must be delivered to a chiller truck by dawn. Animal welfare advocates say that the removal of the kangaroo heads, which is not done by all shooters and not a requirement, makes it impossible to check the accuracy of kill shots. They have also raised concerns about the lack of on-the-ground audits, which would assess damage to animals left behind. But the biggest animal welfare concern is the treatment of joeys. Most female kangaroos of breeding age will have a joey in their pouch or at foot, and those joeys cannot survive without their mother. They are killed by blunt force trauma. RSPCA Australia’s Di Evans says that dealing with joeys is an “intractable” problem. If carried out skillfully blunt force trauma can provide a swift and humane death. But it’s a task that relies on the skill of the hunter, and the size of the joey. Joeys which flee are predated upon or starve to death. Even if you could address other concerns with the trade, says Evans, “I don’t know how you solve the issue of the joeys”. Pearson is a long-term opponent of the commercial kangaroo harvest. In October, a parliamentary inquiry in NSW, of which he was the deputy chair, found issues with the transparency of the methodology used to estimate kangaroo and wallaby populations, and found there was a lack of monitoring and regulation at the point of kill for both commercial and non-commercial operations. The inquiry also found that the NSW parks and wildlife services did not have adequate systems to monitor compliance with licence conditions for non-commercial culling of kangaroos, usually carried out by landholders. “They don’t know how many kangaroos are out there, they don’t know how many they have killed, they don’t know how they have been killed, and they don’t know how many joeys have been killed,” Pearson told Guardian Australia. He said the trade could not be conducted in a humane manner, because even if all commercial shooters were accurate they must still deal with the joeys. And he said the accuracy of shooters cannot be guaranteed without on-the-ground audits, which are not taking place. “How can we be assured that these animals are being killed with a clean shot to the brain, when their heads are left on the ground for the pigs and foxes to eat?” he said. Evans says the RSPCA’s concern with commercial kangaroo harvesting was that it was being managed as a renewable resource, not as an ecological measure designed to mitigate adverse outcomes like overpopulation, overgrazing and starvation. She said there had been a lack of national leadership on kangaroo harvesting, leaving behind a complex, polarising debate with few agreed-upon truths. The RSPCA’s position is that an independent evidence-based review, conducted by a body like a national commission for animal welfare, should be tasked to determine the ecological and animal welfare concerns around macropod overpopulation and develop a mitigation strategy – which may involve commercial harvesting. “That is what has got to happen first – you need to assess and provide evidence of the ecological and welfare harms that you are seeking to address, and then you can determine mitigation measures and assess whether those mitigation measures have had the desired effect,” she says. “We are never going to address this problem if we do not get serious about bringing the right people together and working through this.” Scientists who support commercial kangaroo harvesting say that if Europe were to ban the import, it would remove the most humane method of kangaroo population management, leading to more animals starving due to overgrazing or more animals being killed through non-commercial culls, which are carried out by less-skilled shooters. But leading ecologists have also called for a national kangaroo strategy, which considers population management through the lens of managing the level of resources available in an ecosystem to support kangaroos, and not a quota based on how many animals the industry will take. In January, a collective of Australian ecologists produced a special issue of the journal of Ecological Management and Restoration, focusing on the management of overabundant macropod species. It contained a joint statement, written by eight wildlife scientists, which said that overabundant kangaroo populations must be managed for reasons of both conservation and animal welfare, and that in the absence of dingoes, “regulated and accredited harvesting” was the preferred management method. The statement was endorsed by 25 groups including Bush Heritage Australia, NSW Farmers, the Australian Veterinary Conservation Biology Group, the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation and the Conservation Council of Australia. Dr John Read, one of the eight authors, told Guardian Australia that commercial kangaroo harvesting was preferable to other outcomes when dealing with overabundant kangaroo populations. He said campaigns by animal rights groups had created a “perverse outcome” for kangaroo welfare. “There would be less kangaroos being harvested, but that doesn’t slow down the reproduction rate of kangaroos. That means there are more kangaroos than the country can sustain, and if they are not being harvested by commercial hunters then they are either being culled, or they are being poisoned or dying of starvation,” he says. “They will die a horrible, horrible death.”",News/World news,Why is the EU under pressure to ban kangaroo products and how will it affect Australia?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/why-is-the-eu-under-pressure-to-ban-kangaroo-products-and-how-will-it-affect-australia
3/20/2022,"Allison Mueller was always interested in ceramics but career and family got in the way. Trained in interior design, she worked as a fashion stylist for 30 years. Mueller says the design industry is her “whole life”. She started playing with clay 10 years ago but it wasn’t until three and a half years ago that she began foundation and intermediate ceramics courses at Tafe. About the same time, her daughters moved out of home. With downsizing on the horizon, she could properly commit herself to clay. She found a place with a “little studio space out the back”. She painted the space white and built a custom table and bench for her pottery wheel, trimming tools and buckets. Her kiln sits near the door for ventilation, and rows of white shelving display test tiles and drying projects. Vicki Grima, executive officer of the Australian Ceramics Association, has noticed the “slow uptake” in pottery transform into a sharp rise over the last two years. She says Mueller’s story is typical. “There has always been a trend of hobbyists in the association pivoting from other industries and jobs in their mid-40s to ceramics, to begin community classes.” In the past four years enrolments in ceramics courses at Tafe New South Wales have doubled, says Chris Casali, head teacher of fine arts and ceramics for Tafe’s Sydney region. Pottery students come “at different times in their lives,” Casali says, with needs that vary. While “some want the qualification”, others want “experimentation with resources”. Despite its newfound popularity, particularly among hobbyists, Casali still says “not enough people see the capacity of what ceramics has to offer as a career”. “You can work as an artist, with artists, as an exhibitionist. Many students want a pathway into an arts health practition, like art therapy where clay is used for a whole range of things like motor skills.” Mueller says fashion, homewares and interiors are “coming into one” with ceramics. She points to the success of the Australian homewares company Mud Ceramics. Since opening in Sydney in 2007, the company has expanded to eight stores globally, from Melbourne to Los Angeles to London. This year it will open a second shop in New York City, along with new stores in Byron Bay and Sydney. Mud’s porcelain clay homewares are still handmade in a studio in Sydney’s Marrickville. “People want homeware that is unique, handmade,” Mueller says. “Mud are doing amazing things in this space.” But consumers are not the only ones driving the demand for handmade ceramics. Casali and Mueller say restaurants are also big customers. “It started with the more exclusive restaurants getting ceramic artists to create their dinner wear,” says Mueller. Now these collaborations have “filtered down to even the local cafes”. Not every person finding a passion for pottery is making a mid-life career pivot. For Nicky Li, a 20-year-old university student in actuarial studies and applied finance, an unexpected lockdown hobby turned into a small business. Feeling “super bored” in lockdown, Li “decided to order clay online” after seeing pottery posts on Instagram. Social media is a common entry-point to the craft; on TikTok, Queensland-based home pottery kit company Crock’d has racked up 7.2m views; while on Instagram, there have been more than 300,000 posts under the hashtag #AustralianCeramics. Li’s projects started small, with air dry clay; but she quickly transitioned into sturdier stoneware, turning her parents’ garage in western Sydney into a makeshift studio. After a while, the garage “became insane”. “Clay gets everywhere, all over the floor and table,” she says. Li stored her ceramics projects in stacked bread crates and crowded her workbench with “buckets and buckets of reclaimed clay”. “I had an excess of things I made, and my parents kept saying, ‘What are you going to do with all of it just sitting here?’” Li decided to start selling. She set up Be Kewl, an online store featuring batch-made ceramics, imprinted with slogans and affirmations. It’s still a steep learning curve for Li. Although she now sells her works, ceramics is “definitely not a cheap hobby”. In addition to the cost of clay, Li must pay to fire her works. “I don’t have a kiln, so I hire someone else’s,” she says. Grima says the Australian Ceramics Association receives inquiries about where to find kilns “all the time”. Access “is a bit problematic, with all the people falling in love with ceramics”. “You can’t just cook it in an oven,” she says. “People need to cook it in a specialised kiln, with a minimum fire of 1,000 degrees Celsius.” For hobbyists learning about ceramics from home, Grima suggests checking websites like Crockd’s Kilns Near You, which functions almost like an Airbnb for kilns, charting studios and independent potters offering shared firing spaces. Pottery suppliers, local artists and community centres can also help. “But the reality is, there are lots of places in Australia where there is no access to kilns.” This was a problem even before the pandemic. Kayde Clemans, owner of Bondi Clay, says a lack of accessible kilns is “why we opened up a studio” three years ago. The studio offers casual classes, take-home projects (which were huge sellers during lockdown) and more intensive workshops, but shared facilities – and the community building that comes from it – is central. “People share facilities, but also their thoughts and ideas,” Clemans says. He has since opened ClayGround, a second studio in Rosebery, which caters to intermediate and advanced potters. Casali likens clay work to visiting the ocean or sitting in the forest. “When you touch clay, there is some sort of weird bond … It just feels like you can slow yourself and your mind down.” Grima admires the material’s “amazing chemical change”, starting from “soft muddy stuff” to hardness after firing. For Li, the impermanence of the craft is its big appeal. “Even if your work is dried – if you haven’t fired it yet – you can put it in a bucket of water. It turns back to mush and you can remould it to what you like.” “Even if I make mistakes, I can redo it and see my progression over time.” For Clemans, it is no surprise that a world-altering pandemic drew people to ceramics. “It made people step outside their work life.” He calls ceramics “almost an antidote to modern-day life … You get your hands in it, and you are doing something tactile again.”",Arts/Art and design,All fired up: Australia’s handmade ceramics boom,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/20/all-fired-up-australias-handmade-ceramics-boom
3/20/2022,"‘Iam not some agent of Russia,” wrote a pained Evgeny Lebedev in one of the newspapers he owns with his father, Alexander, the former Russian spy. “I am not a security risk to this country, which I love.” And for once, the sheer preposterousness of Lord Evgeny, the most elaborately costumed proprietor in press history, is on his side. Perhaps it’s reading too much John le Carré, but are serious security risks also likely to be party-mad showoffs, enthralled by celebrities, with titles that sound – “Baron Lebedev, of Hampton in the London Borough of Richmond on Thames and of Siberia in the Russian Federation” – as if they were dreamed up by a rather worrying 10-year-old? Though in that respect it might shed some light on an affinity sometimes considered suspect between Lord Siberia and the no less preposterous world king, Boris Johnson, whose determination to ennoble Lebedev has now embarrassed both. Is it impossible that Tuscan parties featuring celebrities and (Rory Stewart was told) “girls”, might, for such men, represent the pinnacle of human achievement? The similarities don’t stop there. Johnson thinks it stylish to flourish the classics; Lebedev was accessorised with De Profundis and Areopagitica for an appearance at the Leveson inquiry, an early signal of his claim, now endorsed by a Russian winner of the Nobel peace prize, to be called a press “freedom fighter”. Back in 2012 Lebedev tweeted: “Forgot to tell Leveson that it’s unreasonable to expect individuals to spend £millions on newspapers and not have access to politicians.” Both men like posing with their dogs, have fathers who hit people, and with their shared weakness for costly furnishings we can picture them pricing whatnots with the same fervour they bring to discussing Putin’s annexation of Crimea (in 2016 Johnson blamed the EU). Lebedev is said by one editor to have “exquisite taste”; a supporter said the exact same thing about Carrie Johnson, when her taste for neo-colonial polychrome was attacked. Still, for a Russian peer attempting to convince us of the innocent trajectory of his ambitions, “Siberia” is strange. Why allude to the gulags? At once silly (if he wasn’t always on about Russia) and sinister (if he wasn’t always on about Elton John), the title pretty much encapsulates the difficulties with Evgeny Lebedev. Can a person who invariably looks in his countlessclose-ups as if he’s auditioning for the Bullingdon Club really represent a security threat? Unless this fairly crude caricature of Etonian affectations, added to the Lebedevs’ past efforts to detoxify Putin, should only intensify doubts about Johnson’s judgment? Supposing, picking the first option, that Lebedev is guilty of nothing more than absurdity, social mountaineering and, like some valued Tory donors, living on a fortune gained by an occasional endorser of a murderous tyrant, there are many distinguished party guests who could testify to, if nothing else, his generosity. Although to date, we have heard more from Keir Starmer and Rory Stewart, both refusers of Lebedev invites, it’s too soon to conclude that smarter guests have, in the manner of the friends who once enjoyed Philip Green’s toga parties, scented disgrace and fled. It can’t be long, anyway, until we hear from much better informed intimates, from former editors qualified to endorse Johnson’s view of Lord Siberia as a blameless victim of “Russophobia”. Or alternatively, from former editors who, unless they endorse various Lebedevian equivocations on, say, the Litvinenko and novichok poisonings, support the contention that he isn’t. There would be no shame, you could argue, in the admission that without any actual instructions, they would naturally work, as Harold Evans once said of Murdoch’s system, “towards the Fuhrer”. “He doesn’t have to give direct orders. His executives act like courtiers, working towards what they perceive to be his wishes or might be construed as his wishes.” Some executives might be more embarrassed to recall what was always plain: that even editors with journalistic talent effectively doubled – given the pressure to cram Lebedev’s newspaper campaigns with scaleable heaps of politicians, royals and celebrities – as his diary secretaries. In Sasha Swire’s excellent memoirs, George Osborne is reportedly “concerned” that “Evgeny Lebedev is going to use him to arrange his social life”. Pending personal contributions from Osborne and fellow editors including Geordie Greig, Amol Rajan, Sarah Sands, Emily Sheffield and Chris Blackhurst, her account remains, in fact, the closest you can get to squaring Rachel Johnson’s tribute to Lebedev, “much smarter and funnier than people think”, with a tweet he once addressed to some Guardian journalists: “Up yours.” For Swire, when they were David Cameron’s guests at Chequers, Lebedev was “a charisma-free zone”. It was “extraordinary”, she noted in 2015, that the son of a KGB operative had penetrated “the very core of the British establishment by buying a newspaper”. Lebedev senior, she noted, even before junior embarked on some informal diplomacy, “is still pally with Putin”. How was it done? Did journalists serve, in this instance, with the same uncritical alacrity that is now condemned in the politicians, lawyers, estate agents, PRs and other enablers who made London so agreeable for oligarchs? Or was Lebedev smart enough, with Dad, to perform this feat solo? Rajan, once Lebedev’s media adviser, then his Independent editor, has stressed his old boss’s “terrifyingly good memory”, how he was “terrifyingly sharp”. By great good fortune, Rajan is now the BBC’s media editor, star interviewer and Today presenter, thus uniquely placed and equipped to offer insight on this important story. Presumably he’s simply been too busy to comment, to date, on whether Johnson’s passion for Evgeny’s elevation was understandable, or, when you factor in the ex-KGB father and his Crimean investments, fully as reckless as Cameron’s earlier infatuation with the Murdochs. There are those, you hear, who feel the BBC is overly dazzled by the ubiquitous Rajan: what a way this would be for him to prove them wrong.
