3/24/2022,"Michael Bay, the hyperactive thyroid of action cinema, has taken a scrawny little low-budget Danish film called Ambulancen from 2005, about two criminal brothers who hijack an ambulance, put an IV in its tiny arm and pumped it full of radioactive steroids. The result is a supersized remake which runs one hour longer than the original: an LA action movie with explosions, black-and-white cop cars twirling through the air, big muscly guys with big beards and big guns (but no hair) growling menacingly, senior police officers with mirror shades staring grimly off in repose at the LA skyline, gutsy paramedics - and an adorable big dog which one officer sentimentally takes to work with him in the car. This movie is very much a dog person, not a cat person. Hysterically kinetic cinematography means that no one can run in one direction without the camera swooping in the opposite direction overhead. Ambulance has everything … except actors giving a decent performance as believable characters in a workable script. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II plays Will Sharp, a decorated military veteran who badly needs money for his ailing wife’s operation. In desperation, he turns to his dodgy adoptive brother, smoothie career criminal Danny Sharp, played by Jake Gyllenhaal with a twitchy array of supposedly smartass wisecracks and encouraged by the director to display a worryingly uncharismatic kind of “charisma”, running counter to Gyllenhaal’s talent for deliberative coolness. Danny instantly and implausibly recruits Will as a driver for the bank heist he’s going to pull off in half an hour. Erm, is that a good idea for this omnicompetent bad-guy, given that Will has no training or aptitude for the job? Don’t ask. Anyway, the robbery goes mightily sideways; the boys wind up shooting a cop and shoving him into the ambulance they’ve commandeered at gunpoint, in the back of which paramedic Cam Thompson (Eiza González) has no choice but keep the cop alive as they zoom through the streets with the feds in fierce pursuit - often smashing through sidewalk fruit stalls in the time-honoured manner. There’s even a traditional scene driving down the LA river. If only Bay had used natural style and humour of Gyllenhaal and Abdul-Mateen. Instead, they look like people who have never met before stepping out of their luxury trailers. In dialogue scenes, each man looks like he’s looking at a greenscreen, and González has nothing to work with. And for all the spectacular action set pieces, there’s something silly and tedious that sets in well before the two-hour mark. It flatlines.  Ambulance is released on 24 March in Australia, 25 March in the UK, and 8 April in the US.

3/24/2022,"Robert Moses, who largely landscaped metropolitan New York, shared the name of a famous biblical character. Although there, as David Hare’s new play makes vividly clear, the comparisons ended. The urban planner was a far more self-confident prophet and notably more insistent about his commandments being followed. As captured in Ralph Fiennes’ enthralling performance, the American Moses wouldn’t have delivered his instructions from a burning bush, but would have incinerated the entire landscape. Moses’s life encompassed 18 different US presidents, from Grover Cleveland to Ronald Reagan, but Hare focuses on two enclosed episodes. In 1926, he strong-arms New York governor Al Smith into agreeing two vast expressways that will connect the city to parks and beaches on Long Island; in 1955, he attempts to put a road through New York’s Washington Square Park, but is resisted by early versions of nimbyism and environmentalism. Hare once made a version of Henrik Ibsen’s The Master Builder, about an agonised old architect, and Straight Line Crazy feels a knowing homage to that play and Ibsen’s An Enemy of the People, in which the protagonist’s attempts to improve local lives make him a pariah; like him, Moses believes that he is always right and the majority wrong. To the extent that he is, Moses is generally known through Robert A Caro’s monumental 1974 biography, The Power Broker. Hare’s play has no declared relationship with that book (which isn’t even mentioned in the programme) but he has highly praised it in interviews, and there is a stylistic connection. Caro’s long, rhythmic lists of Moses’ projects and motivations sound echoed in riffs that punctuate the action. Dynamic, ideas-driven dialogue, though, makes the play crackle. In a long scene as strong as any Hare has written, Moses and Governor Smith – electrifyingly played by a cigar-sucking, homburg-doffing Danny Webb as a sort of American Churchill – duel over elected and unelected power, the rights of citizens to shape their city and Moses’ belief that areas may need to be ruined to improve them. The three-decade jump to the second act leaves a tangible Smith-shaped hole, and tension somewhat reduces, but Alisha Bailey and Siobhán Cullen impress as Moses’ employees who map cultural movements more astutely than he does. Fiennes’ most recent theatre appearances have been monologues: portraying the playwright in Hare’s Beat the Devil, a soliloquy about surviving Covid, and animating TS Eliot’s Four Quartets. Those solos demonstrated the actor’s remarkable control of voice and body and these skills are not diminished by now sharing the stage with 12 other actors. Often angling his body backwards to thicken his silhouette to the fuller-set Moses, Fiennes emphasises the man’s awkwardness in his skin to the extent of almost becoming a reverse Richard III. Nicholas Hytner’s populous production, with multi-location sets by Bob Crowley, continues the director’s trick, at his new venue, of somehow carrying on as if he has the budgets and resources previously available to him at the National. This is Hare’s most dramatically gripping and politically thoughtful play since The Absence of War three decades ago and provides another acting triumph for Fiennes which, in scenes where the urban monarch broods and rages over maps of his American kingdom, is a preview of the King Lear that is surely soon to come.

3/24/2022,"Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, failed to notify his officials about private messages he exchanged with disgraced Conservative MP Owen Paterson, a healthcare firm’s paid lobbyist, an official watchdog has disclosed. In a critical report, the National Audit Office (NAO) concluded that the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) did not record properly why it awarded contracts worth nearly £500m to the healthcare firm, Randox. The NAO also reported that Hancock’s then department failed to declare four meetings its ministers held with Randox as it was required to do under transparency rules. No minutes of six meetings between Randox and ministers were kept. In a report published on Thursday, the NAO ruled that the gaps in this record-keeping meant it could not certify positively that the contracts had been awarded correctly. However, it added that it had “not seen any evidence that the government’s contracts with Randox were awarded improperly”. The watchdog’s investigation centred on how the health department awarded two contracts to Randox to carry out Covid testing, without other firms being given the opportunity to compete for them. In the early days of the pandemic, the department gave Randox a £133m contract, and then a contract worth £328m in October 2020. The normal rules on holding open competitions for public sector contracts were at the time suspended by the government under emergency powers designed to speed up the award of the contracts. The NAO reported that Hancock and Paterson exchanged messages eight times over private email or WhatsApp between January and October 2020. At the time they were sent, Hancock forwarded only two of them to officials. The others have only recently been shared with the department. Hancock told the NAO that “he did not discuss anything substantive in the messages not forwarded at the time and so did not need to inform the department of their content”. The watchdog said: “These messages were not inconsistent with what the then secretary of state saw as his ministerial responsibility to drive progress, rapidly building testing capacity with Randox and other suppliers.” Documents that the health department was forced to publish last month after pressure from Labour MPs show that after Paterson lobbied Hancock directly, the then health secretary chased his officials, saying he was “very worried” about how his department was treating Randox and other firms. The government has admitted that it often conducted official business over private channels such as WhatsApp during the pandemic, leading to criticism that there is little or no record of how decisions were made. A leaked memo last year revealed how Hancock regularly used a private email account to carry out government business. Another watchdog, the Information Commissioner, is investigating the use of private emails by DHSC ministers. Meg Hillier MP, the chair of the House of Commons public accounts committee, said: “Government grasped the urgent need to increase the scale of testing early in the pandemic. But while it was fast on procurement, it was fast and loose on process. “The Randox contracts illustrate that proper transparency by government is vital. Government didn’t document decisions properly and the public is right to raise questions about whether it was playing with a straight bat.” The NAO concluded that the health department did not record key evidence of how it awarded the first contract, adding: “The department gave us incomplete or no documentation on other significant aspects of the procurement, including detailed due diligence, detailed contractual negotiations leading to the first contract award, and consideration of potential conflicts of interest.” The NAO found that the health department did not have any documents on how it had negotiated the fee it paid Randox for conducting tests that would establish whether millions of individuals had caught Covid. It did not check whether the prices it was paying in the first contract were fair, and subsequently it achieved a reduction after the Cabinet Office concluded it was paying over the odds. Randox did not have enough equipment to conduct the large number of tests that it had been paid to carry out, according to the report. Number 10 and the health department had to step in and persuade universities to give them equipment. Critics have questioned why such a large contract was given to Randox when public sector laboratories or other firms that had capacity could have been used. Hancock visited Randox in Northern Ireland in 2019 on a trip which Paterson helped organise. Spokespeople for both Hancock and Randox sought to characterise the NAO’s findings as uncritical. “The report found no evidence of wrongdoing because there was no wrongdoing – just lots of hard work to expand testing capacity,” Hancock’s spokesperson said. A Randox spokesperson said: “This independent finding vindicates what both Randox and the government have always said, that these contracts were awarded on merit and in keeping with government protocols and regulations at a time of acute national emergency.” The DHSC said: “The NAO concludes there is no evidence that the government’s contracts with Randox were awarded improperly.”",News/Politics,Matt Hancock failed to disclose messages with Owen Paterson over Covid contracts,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/24/matt-hancock-failed-to-disclose-messages-with-owen-paterson-over-covid-contracts
3/24/2022,"A new Shakespearean theatre is to open in Merseyside this summer with a ceremony that celebrates “local heroes” including the builders who constructed it. The £30m Shakespeare North Playhouse in Prescot, Knowsley, has a 470-seat theatre, the Cockpit, modelled on Inigo Jones’s cockpit-in-court design in 17th-century London. The site also has an outdoor performance garden, funded by Liverpudlian comedian Ken Dodd’s charitable foundation, and a small studio theatre, as well as exhibition and educational facilities. A weekend of free activities will commence on 15 July with an event created with Slung Low theatre company entitled All the Joy That You Can Wish, which will feature the players of supporter-owned local football team Prescot Cables as well as the builders from the Kier group who are putting the finishing touches to the venue. Onlookers will be invited to gather at the new Prospero Place outside the theatre and join in a ceremony to “summon the muses” to Knowsley, which is also the Liverpool City Region Borough of Culture for 2022. The weekend continues with performances curated by Prescot-born playwright and actor Ashleigh Nugent. Local heroes will appear on the Cockpit stage too, with screenwriter Jimmy McGovern and comedian Johnny Vegas performing solo shows later in the month. Vegas said the new theatre was both stunning and intimate: “It doesn’t feel like there’s a cheap seat in the house and that’s beautiful. You walk in there and you feel like we’ve taken culture back. Culture, art, creativity, theatre, everything is for all of us and that’s what that space does, it reminds us of that.” The site is anticipated to attract 140,000 visitors a year and Vegas said that it would be “monumental” for the region. Max Steinberg, chair of the Shakespeare North Trust, told the Guardian last summer that bars and restaurants, many of them Shakespeare-themed, were already springing up nearby. “This is not Field of Dreams, a case of build it and they will come,” said Steinberg. “We are building and they have already come.” In September, the playhouse will stage work by three young winners of a nationwide playwriting competition. It will then put on its first Shakespeare production, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, co-produced with Newcastle’s Northern Stage and the company Not Too Tame which is run by Warrington-born Jimmy Fairhurst, a rugby Super League player turned actor. This version of Shakespeare’s fantastical comedy explores class struggle and draws on the raucous energy of teenagers on a night out. The play has a local connection too: it has been claimed that it was written for the marriage of William Stanley, sixth earl of Derby (whose family seat is Knowsley Hall), and Elizabeth de Vere. Laura Collier, creative director at the venue, said the opening season was “a statement of intent in terms of our ambition for the venue and our engagement with the local community and audiences in the years ahead”. Shakespeare North Playhouse has been built during the pandemic with public funds and donations, including £12.2m from Knowsley council, £10.5m from the Liverpool city region combined authority and £3m from the government’s Covid-19 culture recovery fund.",Arts/Stage,Merseyside’s new Shakespeare theatre opens by celebrating builders and footballers,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/24/shakespeare-north-playhouse-open-jimmy-mcgovern-johnny-vegas
3/24/2022,"Julian Assange and his partner, Stella Moris, got married on Wednesday at Belmarsh high-security prison in south-east London. The WikiLeaks founder, 50, was granted permission last year to marry Moris – with whom he has two children – at the prison where he has been held since 2019 after the US took legal action to extradite him to face trial on espionage charges. Moris arrived at the jail wearing a floor-length corseted lilac dress designed by Dame Vivienne Westwood and Andreas Kronthaler, and an elaborate veil embroidered with messages from friends. After the wedding, Moris made an emotional speech to a crowd outside prison. Fighting back tears and wearing her wedding dress, she said: “I’m very happy but I’m very sad … I wish he were here … What we’re going through is inhuman.” She added: “He’s the most amazing person in the world and he should be free. But our love will carry us through.” Supporters said the couple were allowed six guests, including Assange’s two brothers and his father. In an article for the Guardian, Moris described the wedding venue as “the most oppressive high-security prison in the country”. Moris said she and Assange had been locked in a dispute with the Ministry of Justice and prison authorities, who she said rejected their proposed witnesses because they were journalists. A proposed photographer was also denied access because he worked for the press, even though they would all have attended in a private capacity, she added. “The prison states that our wedding picture is a security risk because it could end up on social media or the press,” she wrote. “How absurd. What kind of security threat could a wedding picture pose?” Belmarsh regularly permits photography, according to Moris, who added that the far-right activist Tommy Robinson and other prisoners had been interviewed on camera when ITV filmed inside the prison. Moris added: “But for Julian, who isn’t even serving a sentence, there appears to be a different set of rules …They fear people will see Julian as a human being. A Prison Service spokesperson said: “All weddings in prisons must meet the requirements outlined in the Prison Service policy.” They said photography for weddings in prisons was facilitated by prison staff in line with established national policy on photographing prisoners, and that policy made clear the governor could block images if it was believed they would be shared publicly – which could compromise prison security. As a result, photographs were taken by staff, they said. Earlier this month, Assange moved a step closer to a US trial on espionage charges after the UK’s highest court refused to hear his appeal against extradition. He was attempting to appeal against a judgment by the high court in December that ruled he could be extradited after assurances from the US authorities with regard to his prison conditions there. The supreme court said it had refused permission to appeal “as the application didn’t raise an arguable point of law”. The case is expected to be formally sent to the home secretary, Priti Patel, to approve the extradition.",News/Media,Julian Assange marries Stella Moris in London prison ceremony,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/24/julian-assange-marries-stella-moris-in-london-prison-ceremony
3/24/2022,"A Lithuanian immigrant who may have been a Nazi collaborator during the second world war should be “removed from the fabric of Wollongong” if the claims can be verified, the New South Wales Jewish community says. Bronius “Bob” Sredersas was a folk hero and former steelworker who has been a celebrated figure since he donated his art collection to the Wollongong Art Gallery in 1976 before his death in 1982. On Monday, the Guardian revealed the results of a four-year investigation by the former local councillor Michael Samaras that obtained documents that appeared to show Sredersas worked with the intelligence service of the Waffen SS, known as the Sicherheitsdienst (SD). Later he fled to Germany ahead of the advance by the Soviet Union where he applied for German citizenship and attempted to join the SS as a volunteer before he emigrated to Australia following the war. The NSW Jewish Board of Deputies CEO, Darren Bark, said now this history was known the allegations should be thoroughly investigated. “If this individual has indeed hoodwinked the community, swift action should be taken by council to ensure that he is removed from the fabric of Wollongong – it’s the least the community deserves,” Bark said. The Wollongong city council lord mayor, Gordon Bradbery, said he first learned of the allegations against Sredersas from the media.“If I had been approached, I would have actioned it sooner. I’m sure that goes for senior staff at council,” Bradbey said. “We weren’t notified of it and that does concern me that it didn’t come straight to me, the lord mayor, or the general manager.” “I was just so shocked that this had not been uncovered sooner in terms that goes back to the days when the man arrived, possibly if it was the same person. “And this is where you’ve got to be very careful as much as this accusation needs to be validated.” Samaras approached the city council about his research in January but was sent an email in response saying that “on balance, given the lack of clear evidence in this case, it is not deemed appropriate for council – as a local government body – to undertake such an investigative role as suggested. “As such, council does not propose to take any further steps in this matter as this time,” it said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Bradbery said the matter had been mishandled as at the time the council had been shut down over the holiday period and was dealing with a Covid-19 surge, leaving it understaffed. He said the response to Samaras had been handled by junior staff on the understanding that additional information would be provided by Samaras later. In an effort to address the situation, Bradbery said the council had made an official report to the Australian federal police (AFP) which oversees war crimes legislation and that this report had been referred on to an international agency to investigate further. The AFP has oversight of Australia’s war crimes legislation but where a person is no longer alive there is limited capacity to act. The AFP has been contacted. Wollongong city council has also arranged to meet with the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies and representatives from the Sydney Jewish Museum early next week, after the Board of Deputies wrote to the council on Monday raising its concerns and offering to assist in an investigation. “We look forward to working with them and the Sydney Jewish Museum, a constituent organisation of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, to deliver answers to the Wollongong community,” Bark said.

The Sydney Jewish Museum has an in-house historian who conducts research into the Holocaust and other war crimes committed during the second world war. Rebecca Kummerfeld, the education officer at the museum, said the incident raised confronting questions for Wollongong and other communities about the capacity of people who do good to also “do really atrocious things”. “If it does come out that this man did commit crimes and he was involved in genocide, it is going to be an opportunity for dialogue and asking some really challenging questions,” Kummerfeld said. “It is important to understand the people who contributed to this country. And to understand the light and shade in their contribution, whatever that may mean.”",News/Australia news,Wollongong urged to take swift action if Nazi claims against local identity are proven,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/24/wollongong-urged-to-take-swift-action-if-nazi-claims-against-local-identity-are-proven
