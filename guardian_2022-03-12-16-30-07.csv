3/12/2022,"Midway through Roberto Bolaño’s novel 2666, a gang of policemen sit in a coffee shop trading misogynistic jokes. The scene’s grim power arises from its setting: Santa Teresa, a city suffering a decade-long torrent of femicides. Practically all these crimes will go unsolved. Santa Teresa, and the murders 2666 relentlessly itemises, have their real-world counterparts in Ciudad Juárez, which stands on the border between Mexico and the US. It lies more than 1,000 miles north of Veracruz, the Mexican state where Fernanda Melchor was born, but her books are marinated in precisely the same misogyny and violence. In her extraordinary 2020 novel Hurricane Season, her first to appear in English, she relates the story of a rural murder from multiple viewpoints. Her long, fevered sentences – which carry off daredevil moves, such as shifting tense and viewpoint from one clause to the next – combine with the emotional and physical violence of the story to produce a cacophonous effect. But time spent with her writing leaves no doubt: the unholy noise she creates is the work of someone who knows exactly which notes to hit. Paradais, which has been longlisted for the International Booker prize, has a tighter focus than Hurricane Season (both are superbly translated into English by Sophie Hughes). Its sentences are less breathless and serpentine, but its subject matter is equally challenging: murder, torture, rape, incest, domestic abuse and numerous forms of exploitation. Again we are in a Mexico where people feel getting what they want means ripping it from someone else’s hands; where young men aspire to join the narcos not because they are evil or homicidal, but because it’s the only route out. Melchor’s determination to show rather than judge, even amid mounting horror, preserves her characters’ humanity. If Hurricane Season depicted those with almost nothing killing each other for scraps, Paradais is about the faultline between the 1% and those who service their needs. This tension is there in the inability of the main character, Polo, to pronounce the English name of the gated community where he works as a gardener: “Paradise”, rather than the Spanish “Paraíso”. The book’s title is a phonetic rendering of the same: “Paradais, Urquiza corrected Polo the second time he tried to say that gringo shit. It’s pronounced Pa-ra-dais, not Pa-ra-dee-sey. Paradais.” Polo is just 16, a school dropout; “dark skinned and ugly as sin, his mother would say”. He forms an uneasy friendship (always temporary and transactional in Melchor’s novels) with the blond, overweight and porn-addicted Paradise resident Franco. Franco is obsessed with his neighbour, a mother of two whose husband is a TV celebrity, and this obsession results in the formulation of a plan that spirals steeply downward. To say more would interfere with the book’s incredible dark momentum, even though from the first sentence you know – and spend the next 100 pages desperately resisting knowing – exactly where it’s heading. “I wanted to write a novel that the reader just couldn’t let go [of]”, Melchor said of Hurricane Season. She succeeded, and now she’s done it again. Polo and Franco’s alliance is complex: Polo is older, but Franco is rich. Polo despises Franco but hangs out with him because he pays for the booze they consume, sometimes to the point of vomiting, in the jungle that lies beyond Paradise’s manicured gardens. Both teenagers are alternately childlike and terrifyingly callous. Polo thinks Franco’s plan is just talk almost until they’re shopping for dark tights, condoms and “kidnapper tape”, but he spurns his chances to back out. He repeatedly imagines the river that runs past Paradise, where he used to fish with his grandfather, as a route to salvation, but when he eventually enters it, it only returns him to the life he wants to escape. The thematic violence of Paradais is duplicated at sentence level. Polo’s vocabulary is jagged with abusive, misogynistic and homophobic slurs. Franco is a “shit-eating little poof”; a waterway “stank of snatch”; his cousin, who might be pregnant with Polo’s child, is a “skank”, a “slut” and a “whore”. Amid this assaultive flood, however, fragments of a higher, more baroque register emerge: a “predacious spider”; a “profanatory beast” – a gopher, wrecking the “sempiternal lawns of Paradais”. These unexpected flourishes complicate the story, suggesting the presence of a less neutral narrator than much of the text has us suppose. That Melchor provides no other clue to their identity only adds to the disconcerting effect. Earlier in the novel, before chaos takes hold, Polo hacks with his machete at “the pestilent jungle of plants that sprang up … on the roadsides, or right in the middle of the splendid gardens of Paradais”. At its end Melchor pointedly describes life in the gated community carrying on as normal, but only because its residents don’t realise their security cameras, guards and walls have proved ineffective. Paradise is already lost; they just haven’t found the bodies yet.  Paradais by Fernanda Melchor, translated by Sophie Hughes, is published by Fitzcarraldo (£10.99).

3/12/2022,"Ukrainian officials have said Kyiv is “ready to fight” as Russian forces renewed their bombardment on the capital and observers warned of “an unimaginable tragedy” unfolding after more than two weeks of war. Air raid sirens and shelling rang out over Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities on Saturday morning amid warnings from western defence officials that the Russians were beginning to gain ground around the capital. There were reports of loud explosions in Dnipro in the country’s east on Saturday, as well as Mykolaiv, Nikolaev and Kropyvnytskyi. But the Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said the capital was “ready to fight”. He called it a “city under siege”, with checkpoints prepared and supply lines in place. “Kyiv will stand until the end.” Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies on Saturday has shown homes and buildings on fire and Russian artillery battalions appearing to fire on towns surrounding to the north-west of the Ukrainian capital as forces advance. The Guardian has not independently verified the images. A senior US defence official said at the Pentagon briefing on Friday: “We do assess that the Russians are beginning to make more momentum on the ground towards Kyiv, particularly from the east.” The UK Ministry of Defence said on Saturday morning that “the bulk of Russian ground forces” were around 25km from the centre of Kyiv, while the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remain encircled and continued to suffer heavy Russian shelling. However, the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, said that Russian operations around Kyiv “remained largely stalled over the past 24 hours” to “resupply and refit frontline units” – an assessment shared by Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych, who said on Friday that the Russian advance had been halted over the past day. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called on Ukrainians to continue fighting, but said living conditions in the Kyiv region had deteriorated into a “humanitarian catastrophe” with disrupted gas, heating and water. The Ukrainian president said his country had reached a “strategic turning point” in the conflict. “It is impossible to say how many days we still have [ahead of us] to free Ukrainian land. But we can say we will do it,” he said. “We are already moving towards our goal, our victory.” About 2 million people – half the population of the metropolitan area – had left the capital, the Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Friday, and those who remained continued to prepare for its defence. “Every street, every house is being fortified,” he said. “Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.” Ukrainian soldiers described fierce fighting for control of the main highway leading into the capital, while missile strikes were reported hitting just outside Kyiv’s city limits on Friday. “It’s frightening, but what can you do?” said Vasil Popov, a 38-year-old who works in advertising sales. “There is nowhere to really run or hide. We live here.” Continuing Russian bombardments and attacks on civilians in cities across Ukraine have prompted warnings of “an unimaginable tragedy” and a new flurry of alarm from the UN that Russia is committing war crimes. “We are really heading towards an unimaginable tragedy,” Stephen Cornish of Doctors Without Borders told Agence France-Presse, insisting “there is still time to avoid it, and we must see it avoided”. Hundreds of thousands of civilians remain trapped and under fire in Ukrainian cities, but the situation in Mariupol is especially dire. Ten days into Russia’s siege, its population has no access to electricity or mobile phone networks, and water and food are running out. On Friday 7,144 people were evacuated from four Ukrainian cities, Zelenskiy said in a televised address – a much lower number than managed to leave in each of the two previous days. Zelenskiy accused Russia of refusing to allow people out of Mariupol and said Ukraine would try again to deliver food and medicines there on Saturday. Ukraine has repeatedly raised concerns that Moscow’s ally Belarus, which has served as a staging point for Russian forces, will soon have its troops drawn into the invasion. Ukraine’s state centre for strategic communications said Belarus might launch an invasion of Ukraine today, after a meeting in Moscow between the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko. Ukraine accused Russia of staging “false flag” air attacks on Belarus from Ukraine to provide an excuse for an offensive. Putin and Lukashenko agreed on Friday that Moscow would supply its smaller neighbour with military equipment and mutual support against western sanctions, including on energy prices, the official Belarus state news agency BelTA said. Foreign combatants have already entered the Ukrainian conflict on both sides, but the Kremlin has ramped up efforts to bring in reinforcements from Syria. Syria’s military has begun recruiting troops from its own ranks to fight alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, promising payments of $3,000 a month – a sum of up to 50 times more than a Syrian soldier’s monthly salary. A furious Zelenskiy accused Russia of hiring “murderers from Syria, a country where everything has been destroyed … like they are doing here to us”. As the war continues, Russia faces an expanding net of sanctions. Western governments have announced plans to impose punitive tariffs on Russian trade to further isolate Moscow from the global economy. The G7 group of wealthy nations said it would strip Russia of “most favoured nation” status under World Trade Organization rules. The US president, Joe Biden, announced plans to ban the import of seafood, vodka and diamonds from Russia, and the UK government says it is planning to ban exports of luxury goods to Russia. Deutsche Bank and Sony Pictures have joined the exodus of western businesses from Russia. In a statement posted on its website, Deutsche Bank said it was “in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia” and that there “won’t be any new business in Russia”. Russia has moved to block Instagram after its parent company, Meta, said it would allow calls for violence against Putin and Russian soldiers involved in the invasion of Ukraine to appear on the social media platform. Russian prosecutors demanded that access to Instagram be blocked, and authorities moved to recognise Meta as an “extremist organisation”. The US has also imposed sanctions on a group of Russia’s elite, including billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, three family members of Putin’s spokesman and members of parliament.

3/12/2022,"Today there will be a service in the Keele University chapel, led by former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, to celebrate Neil Baldwin’s 76th birthday. Last night a play about Neil’s life opened in the innovative local theatre the New Vic in Stoke-on-Trent. But who is this Neil Baldwin? A top politician, or elite athlete, or concert pianist or footballer? No, this is Neil Baldwin the legend – a legend that I and this newspaper helped create. Neil turned up on the Keele campus in 1960, an engaging local schoolboy with learning difficulties who liked the place and kept coming. By 1964 he was there on the first day of the new academic year to greet new students cheerfully: “Welcome to Keele. I’m Neil Baldwin.” Some say he was wearing a dog collar – he certainly wore one later on, when he hitch-hiked around the country. One of those 1964 newcomers was Malcolm Clarke, who was glad of Neil’s warm welcome, but wondered what his official role was. He didn’t have one. But generations of Keele students have cared for him, admired him, and learned about life from him. Clarke was one of the first: he and Neil have been friends ever since, going together most Saturdays to watch the local football team, Stoke City, where in the 1990s the then manager Lou Macari made Neil a sort of mascot for the team. He had a spell as a circus clown, and he took to visiting top politicians and bishops and archbishops. Once they got over their surprise, they took him to their hearts. That’s how Rowan Williams got to know him. Neil heard that the former archbishop, by then Master of Magdelene College, Cambridge, was due to speak at Keele. He talked his way into the dinner afterwards and on to Rowan Williams’s table, and explained that he often visited Cambridge with his football team (the Neil Baldwin Football Club, a Keele institution now). Williams said politely that Neil must visit him when in Cambridge, and Neil instantly whipped out a notebook for Williams to write down his address. Neil did visit, frequently, and the two are such firm friends now that Williams is travelling to Keele from his Cardiff home to lead today’s service, and will go to the theatre afterwards. In 2010 I profiled Neil for this newspaper, and my article inspired the television film Marvellous about his life, with Toby Jones as Neil, which won three Baftas. Then there was a biography, written jointly by Neil and Malcolm Clarke. After that, the world seemed to beat a path to Neil’s door. Keele University gave him an honorary degree, and asked him to keep the news to himself until it was officially announced, so Neil told only his friends – but he has a lot of friends, and it’s unlikely the announcement came as a surprise to anyone. These friends then lobbied the honours system, and in 2019 Neil was awarded the British Empire Medal. Neil has loved it all. His beloved mother, Mary, used to worry about how he would manage when she was no longer there to look after him, but he has obeyed her last instruction: he has been happy. In a straightforward, unpretentious way he has loved the limelight. “I’m even more famous now,” he told me after the film was made. It was just a statement of fact, unmediated by the false modesty that would have made most of us say it differently. But I suspect the New Vic’s production will bring him more happiness than any of it, partly because it’s his local theatre and the company took him to their hearts, but mainly because this time he was a key part of the creative team – there’s a real sense that the show is his work. “I chose Michael Hugo to play me,” he told me, and it’s true – or at least, he recommended Hugo, a regular New Vic performer, to director Theresa Heskins after seeing the multitalented actor in the New Vic’s adaptation of The 39 Steps. “I could see at once he was right for the part,” Neil added. He’s delighted with the result. “Michael is fantastic,” he told me. And “he’s a very nice man” – Neil’s highest accolade, which he also bestows on Rowan Williams. Neil participated in the creation of the show at every stage, and is jointly credited as writer alongside Theresa Heskins. “Almost all the words are Neil’s. I’ve been more like an editor,” said Heskins. He’s ensured that his two favourite hymns are in – How Great Thou Art and The Church’s One Foundation. What’s his favourite bit of the play, I asked? “All of it,” said Neil. Neil is so pleased with the show that he has, he told me, splashed out £320 on a three-piece suit for the occasion, including a £30 waistcoat which he managed to buy for only £6. The suit had its first outing at Thursday’s dress rehearsal, where I watched the show with him. Heskins has created a fast-moving gallop through Neil’s life, with song and dance and pantomime and clowning and much else besides. And alongside it all, she may have found some new insights into what makes Neil Baldwin special. He does not, she says, make the usual distinction between people laughing with him and people laughing at him. And that, she seems to argue, is one of his greatest strengths.",Arts/Stage,"‘I like all of it’: Neil Baldwin, Staffordshire local hero, on a new play about his remarkable life",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/12/i-like-all-of-it-neil-baldwin-staffordshire-local-hero-on-a-new-play-about-his-remarkable-life

3/12/2022,"A director of the Cardiff Philharmonic Orchestra says it has been taken aback by the backlash against its decision to remove the Russian composer Tchaikovsky from its forthcoming programme because of the conflict in Ukraine. Members of the orchestra were also said to have been among those who had voiced reservations about playing Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture – which celebrates Russia’s defence against the invasion of Napoleon and is notable for featuring a volley of cannon fire – when the matter was discussed with them. The 1812 Overture was due to be included in the orchestra’s Tchaikovsky concert at St David’s Hall on 18 March, but the entire programme has been abandoned because of events in Ukraine. Japan’s Chubu Philharmonic Orchestra made a similar move this week, announcing it will replace a performance of the 1812 Overture with another piece. Linda Robinson, a teacher who is one of the directors, said Cardiff’s decision was made in consultation with the venue, St David’s Hall, and rejected what she said had been a depiction by some critics of the decision as “anti-Russian”. In fact, three concerts this year will include work by Russian composers, including Sergei Prokofiev and Sergei Rachmaninoff. “It was nothing to do with Tchaikovsky being Russian. It was much more to do with us deciding that it was inappropriate at the present time, given that some pieces are military themed and they come with the sound of a volley of cannon fire,” said Robinson, who added that the orchestra has been receiving harsh emails since the news of its decision and had been shocked by the way it was portrayed on social media. Other factors included consideration for an orchestra member with a Ukrainian-born partner who has family members in Ukraine, which Russia has invaded, and that the orchestra was made aware that the title, “Little Russian” of Symphony No 2, could be deemed offensive to Ukrainians. The move was discussed with musicians, she said, adding: “The people who said anything said: ‘This would be my preference but whatever you do I fully support you.’ There were a few people who had stronger feelings than others. Most people agreed with the decision.” Robinson said the orchestra would play the Ukrainian national anthem at the beginning of the event on 18 March and take a collection for the Ukrainian crisis appeal. Instead of Tchaikovsky, the orchestra will present a programme centred on Antonín Dvořák’s symphony No 8. It will also include John Williams’s The Cowboys Overture and a performance of Edward Elgar’s Enigma Variations in the second half. In Japan, the Chubu Philharmonic Orchestra board chair, Takahisa Kato, was quoted as saying: “While there are people who can appreciate it purely as music, there are others who might question why we would perform a Russian victory hymn.” The move in Wales has made headlines around the world, while those seeking to ridicule the orchestra’s decision ranged from self-styled “anti-woke” critics to commentators working for Russian state media who sought to liken it to “book burning”. Many others accused the orchestra of overreacting, pointing out Tchaikovsky’s Ukrainian roots. But those coming to the defence of the orchestra included Ben Schwartz, a US screenwriter, who tweeted that the decision was “not a freedom fries move” – in response to anyone likening it to a move by a US restaurant to express distaste for French opposition to the US invasion of Iraq – and said the orchestra was still playing Russian music later in the season. Richard Bartholomew, a UK blogger and classical music fan, said: “I love Russian music and the 1812 Overture is great fun, but I don’t think that a celebration of Russian nationalism and martial valour hits the right note just now. “In particular, cannons accompanying the old Tsarist national anthem is in bad taste while cities in Ukraine are under bombardment. It’s not unusual for a schedule or broadcast to be amended due to something happening in the wider world, and Cardiff Philharmonic’s decision is just an example of that.” He was “disturbed and sorry” that a whole Tchaikovsky night had been scrapped, but the promise of Rachmaninov’s Symphony No 2 in June had made him think it was not a case of Russophobia.",News/UK news,Cardiff orchestra defends move to cut Tchaikovsky from concert,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/12/cardiff-orchestra-defends-cut-tchaikovsky-concert-russia
3/12/2022,"Could you be related to someone famous? Well, yes. There are a lot of famous people in this country now, and a lot of famous long-dead explorers and writers and train inventors previously, and the way generations work – a marriage here, a bloodline there, a sojourn to Scotland for 300 years – it would be weirder if you weren’t. But could you make a TV show out of that ancestral quirk? Channel 4 seems to think so, with Fame in the Family (Mon to Fri, 5.30pm), a reverse Who Do You Think You Are?, only with fewer shots of librarians and sobbing and more of getting day-drunk over dinner. The format is this: four strangers take a DNA test, and at least one of them is vaguely related to a vaguely famous person. All four are summoned to a meal and given a bizarre box of clues about the famous person – often these clues are, literally, “a piece of paper someone has printed out”, to give you an idea of how charmingly lo-fi the whole enterprise is – before the famous person arrives and they all say, “Wow”. The first famous person is Craig Revel Horwood, to show the calibre of celebrity we’re talking about. The second is Channel 4’s pet maniac Shaun Ryder. After three rounds of guessing and some awkward talking-while-trying-to-eat, each stranger has to guess who is related to the celebrity before the big reveal. If they are right (they are never right), they win £1,000. The two slightly related people, celebrity and civilian, hug at the end. That’s the show. Is it good? Weirdly, yes. There’s a certain timbre to Channel 4 teatime TV – the Four in a Beds, Come Dine With Mes, the Coach Trips – that is mild and peril-free, the sort of ambient television that is perfect to chain-watch on an all-day hangover. Fame in the Family fits neatly into that timeslot: it’s on the outer reaches of interesting, like talking to someone at a wedding for just long enough to find one thing in common (“Oh your mum is from Northumberland? My grandmother was from Northumberland! No I’ve never been … ”). It keeps you occupied without troubling you to have to stay awake. There are two things that are strikingly delightful about all this: first, nobody on this programme has any idea what tone or shape it will take (this includes the celebrity guests!) and it shows. The contestants keep sniping at each other in their mid-meal interviews – “I think June might be a dark horse, you know” – as if sharing some mild fact about how her mother used to practise clog dancing makes her more related to Craig Revel Horwood than the actual DNA test. Odd streaks of jealousy come out when one stranger has slightly more in common with Shaun Ryder’s uncle than the others; there are weird Cluedo-esque attempts to one-up and outguess each other. Nobody knows what’s happening but they all know that, by the end of the day, one of them is going home with the phone number of a Strictly judge. It adds a frisson of panic to everything they do.The second thing is, and there is no unpretentious way of saying this, the dynamic of watching celebrities interact with non-celebrities is refreshingly enjoyable. I am bored of seeing celebrities talk to other celebrities on panel and chat shows: it’s all just a charisma-off where everyone knows to keep their anecdotes nice and tight for the edit, and Jimmy Carr is doing that laugh in the background somewhere. Fame in the Family gives the celebrities just long enough to dazzle some strangers with their sheer famousness, before it quickly wears off: over the meal they actually have to get to know each other, to try to find common ground. It’s occasionally (especially with Craig Revel Horwood: he comes off amazingly, and there is now no one in Britain I’d rather go for champagne with) like watching a king hold court. And then the reveal, every single time, is completely underwhelming – “Craig and Holly share Welsh ancestry. Though the others have Welsh ancestry too, it’s not the same ancestry” – then everyone half-drunkenly hugs before taking a “Related?! Gosh how weird!” selfie then going home. That’s it! It’s perfect teatime TV! I can only hope for 500 more episodes of it. Judging by the amount of famous DNA sloshing around this island, that shouldn’t be too difficult to arrange.",Arts/Television & radio,500 more episodes please!

3/12/2022,"As the cost of living crisis deepens, you may be assessing your regular monthly outgoings and looking for things you can cut back on. If you are lucky enough to be a homeowner, your biggest monthly expense is likely to be your mortgage. But will your lender allow you to reduce your payments if you explain that you are struggling? And how will that affect your credit record? Similarly, if you have life insurance or a pension, can you take a break from your payments, and what will the consequences be? According to UK Finance, the trade association for banks, mortgage lenders should offer “forbearance” to any customer who is in financial difficulty or unable to make their mortgage payments. This could take the form of an authorised payment holiday, where your lender gives you permission not to pay your mortgage for a short period, usually up to three months. Alternatively, with your lender’s permission, you may be allowed to reduce your monthly repayments. These arrangements come at a cost. Any payment holiday will be noted on your credit record, which could have implications the next time you want to borrow money – you may, for example, be charged a higher interest rate. You will also be expected to pay back everything you have missed paying once you are no longer in financial difficulty. Your mortgage is likely to cost you significantly more in the long run. “The big downside of payment holidays is that you end up with a bigger mortgage to contend with when you do restart making payments,” says David Hollingworth of the mortgage broker L&C. Every day that you don’t reduce the original sum you owe you will be accruing interest on it. Plus, you will have to make up the missing payments. That means “you end up making a higher payment for the remainder of the mortgage – because you’ve got a bigger mortgage”, Hollingworth says. What’s more, lenders are only likely to agree to a payment holiday if they think your situation is temporary and a short break will give you enough breathing space to get back on your feet. “They would want to be sure it was the right thing to do because it’s going to cost you more money in the longer run,” he adds. It may be possible to reduce your life insurance cover or take a short break from your payments, without it affecting your cover – but only if your insurer agrees. LV= allows this – but you can only benefit if your policy (for income protection, critical illness or life insurance) has been in force for a year or more, you have a good history of paying and are less than three months behind with monthly premiums. You must declare that you have suffered a significant drop in your income or that your usual earnings have stopped. The payment break will only be offered for a month at a time, for up to three months. There is no requirement for you to make up the missed premiums and your cover will remain in place throughout the payment break period. Afterwards, your premiums will go back up to your normal level and you will not be able to apply for another break after that. Your insurer, if it is not LV=, may take a different approach. “If you are having problems keeping up your premium payments, the first thing you should do is contact your insurer to see what they could suggest,” says Malcolm Tarling of the Association of British Insurers. “They may follow the lead of LV= and say: ‘We can stop your premiums and you can have a premium holiday for a specific period of time.’ Or they may say you can reduce your premiums but you’d have to take a corresponding reduction in the amount of cover you have.” AIG takes this second approach with customers who are in financial hardship. It will consider allowing you to reduce the monthly cost of your protection insurance for up to six months but you will not be able to take a complete break from your payments. Most importantly, during the period you are paying reduced premiums, the value of cover you have will be reduced. For example, it says a 33-year-old with £250,000 of life cover, paying £21.86 a month, could reduce their payments to £4.17 a month for six months. However, the maximum that could be claimed during this six-month period would be only £10,000. In other words, in this scenario, an 80% reduction in the cost of the monthly policy would lead to a 96% reduction in the value of cover, and would leave your loved ones £240,000 worse off if you died – while saving you only £17.69 a month. However, if £4.17 a month is all that you can afford and you want to keep some kind of cover in place, then this drastic step may be worth considering. At the end of the six months, you can either stay on your reduced premium or increase it back to your usual level, with no further underwriting required. You will not be asked to cover the difference in payments when your premiums return to normal, and throughout the six-month period you will have access to AIG’s 24/7 health and wellbeing support services. You may also be considering reducing or stopping your pension contributions for a while. This may ease your financial pressures a little in the short-term but it will reduce your income in retirement. “Staying in your pension and making regular contributions, if they’re affordable, is one of the greatest ways you can protect your future,” says Eve Read, a spokesperson for Nest, the not-for-profit scheme set up by the government to facilitate workplace pensions. “Especially if you save into a workplace pension, like Nest, as your employer will pay in money, and you get tax relief from the government, too – these extra contributions effectively double your investment.” From April, the average household’s yearly energy bill is expected to increase by £693 a year or £57.75 a month, according to Ofgem. If you are a basic-rate taxpayer and you divert £57.75 a month from your pension contributions to your energy bill for a year, you will miss out on £14.45 in tax relief a month and £34.90 a month in employer contributions (assuming your employer contributes the minimum amount it can to your pension each month via auto-enrolment). Cutting £693 a year from your pension will mean £1,284 less goes into your fund. If that money manages to grow by 5% a year until you retire, the long-term cost is even greater. Hargreaves Lansdown, an investment platform, estimates that a 40-year-old basic-rate taxpayer who cuts back on their pension payments in this way – reducing their contributions by only £57.75 a month for only one year – would end up £4,569 worse off, before fees, by the age of 67. “It can be tempting to cut pension contributions when money gets tight but it is important to remember that you are losing more than just your own contribution,” Helen Morrissey, a senior pensions and retirement analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says. “Tax relief and the employer contribution give your pension a real boost, and along with long-term investment returns can have a powerful impact on how much you end up with in retirement. “If you do find yourself in a position where you have to cut or stop your contributions, try to resume them as soon as you can.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Cost of living crisis: you can cut your bills, but there may be pitfalls",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/12/cost-of-living-crisis-you-can-cut-your-bills-but-there-may-be-pitfalls
3/12/2022,"Take Bill Barr literally, but not too seriously. One day before his memoir was published, the former attorney general told NBC he would vote for Donald Trump for president in 2024, if Trump were the Republican nominee. For all Barr’s protestations about how the man was unsuited to the job, he continues to resist being banished from Trump’s garden. Said differently, Barr’s memoirs are best viewed as just one more installment of Trump-alumni performance art. As a read, One Damn Thing After Another delivers the expected. Barr gives Trump a thumbs-up for galvanizing the Republican white working-class base, satisfying social conservatives and meeting the demands of donors. At the same time, Barr lets us know suburbia came to find Trump offensive and insists that in the end, Trump crashed and burned despite Barr’s best efforts. Ultimately, like everyone else the 45th president ceased to find useful, Barr was simply spat out – a reality his memoir does at least acknowledge. The book is informative – to a point. As expected, Barr omits relevant facts and engages in score-settling. It’s a first-person tell-all, after all. Barr records the suicide in federal custody of Jeffrey Epstein, predator and friend of presidents Trump and Clinton. He makes no mention of the fact that his own father, Donald Barr, gave Epstein one of his first jobs, as a high-school math teacher at the Dalton school, a tony Manhattan establishment. Even then, former students have said, Epstein creeped out young women. Barr was attorney general for the first time under George HW Bush. In his book, he attacks Democrats and the media for their pursuit and coverage of “Iraqgate” and the US government’s extension of loan guarantees to Saddam Hussein in the run-up to the invasion of Kuwait. Barr singles out William Safire, the late Nixon speechwriter and New York Times columnist, for special condemnation. A Clinton administration investigation cleared Barr of legal wrongdoing – a fact he rightly emphasizes. But he neglects to mention that in October 1989, Bush signed National Security Directive 26, which effectively boosted Iraq as a counterbalance to Iran. From there, things didn’t exactly work out as planned. The president and his team overly emboldened Saddam. His unprovoked land grab was an unintended consequence of a policy pivot. Barr lets us know he grew up in a loving home, a product of a Catholic education, a player of the bagpipes. He attended the Horace Mann school in Riverdale, an affluent part of the Bronx. As Barr notes, the school was liberal and predominately Jewish. As a Columbia undergraduate, he stood against Vietnam war protesters. His antipathy toward the radical left is longstanding. He joined the Majority Coalition, a group of students and faculty members who defended the main administration building. As recorded by the late Diana Trilling, some rioters had no qualms about trashing the school, then demanding academic honors. Unstated by Barr is the operative campus divide, “Staten Island v Scarsdale”: conservative, often Catholic students from the blue-collar outer borough versus liberal, often Jewish students from the well-heeled suburbs. Though far from working class, Barr was firmly in the first camp. Barr came by his conservatism organically. His father served in the second world war. His older brother fought in Vietnam. In 1964, Barr helped his dad distribute campaign literature for Barry Goldwater’s ill-fated presidential campaign. Amid the turmoil of the 60s, Barr yearned for the stability of yesterday. He still does: he is a culture warrior in a Brooks Brothers suit. He takes shots at James Comey and Robert Mueller, key figures in the Russia investigation. Of course he does. He also takes aim at Lawrence Walsh, special counsel in Iran-Contra. Barr accuses Walsh, now dead, of torpedoing Bush’s campaign comeback in ’92 by filing election-eve charges against Casper Weinberger, Ronald Reagan’s defense secretary. Barr’s ire is understandable. But he also offers up a full-throated defense of his own decision to drop government charges against Michael Flynn, despite the Trump ally’s guilty plea to lying to the FBI and, later, demand for martial law. Furthermore, Barr says nary a word in response to the volley of criticism he earned from the federal bench. In spring 2020, Judge Reggie Walton, a George W Bush appointee, “seriously” questioned the attorney general’s integrity and credibility. To drive home the point, to describe Barr’s behavior over the Russia report, Walton deployed words like “distorted” and “misleading”. Emmett Sullivan scorned Barr’s legal gymnastics over Flynn. Amy Berman Jackson ruled that the government had to turn over a memorandum it relied upon in declining to prosecute Trump. Her take was lacerating. Not only had Barr been personally “disingenuous” by announcing his decision before Mueller’s report was released, Berman Jackson said, but the Department of Justice itself had been “disingenuous to this court”. Suffice to say, Walton, Sullivan and Berman Jackson do not appear in Barr’s book. As luck would have it, though, Barr does take aim at Joe Biden for his stance on Russia. “Demonizing [Vladimir] Putin is not a foreign policy,” Barr writes, nor “the way grown-ups should think”. Really? Looks like Barr didn’t have an invasion of Ukraine on his bingo card. Trump’s admiration for Putin, of course, continues. As it turned out, Barr wasn’t alone in spilling his guts to NBC. In a letter to Lester Holt, its lead anchor, Trump wrote of his former attorney general: “He is groveling to the media, hoping to gain acceptance that he doesn’t deserve.” So true.

3/12/2022,"In the week since the Kremlin blocked Facebook, hundreds of thousands of Russians have sought to circumvent the ban using a virtual private network. A VPN creates an encrypted connection between your device and a remote server, which can be anywhere in the world, so in theory you can access sites blocked in your country. Nikolay*, a Russian who now lives in the EU, says his friends back home bought a VPN in order to communicate with him and others amid fears that access to the outside world could become limited. “There is a lot of talk that people should get these VPNs as soon as possible,” says Nikolay. Over the past week VPNs have been in strong demand in Russia. Internet searches for VPN services in the country almost doubled between 4 March and 10 March compared with the previous week, according to Top10VPN, a UK company that reviews and recommends private network services. There were at least 260,000 searches on 5 March alone, the day after Facebook was banned. “By replacing their Russian IP address with that of the remote server, which will typically be in another country, using a VPN means Russians can access internet services that are blocking Russian traffic,” says Simon Migliano, head of research at Top10VPN. If Ukraine is widely perceived to be winning the information war, then inside Russia the battle is, in part, about viewing content produced outside its borders. Responding to a move to restrict access to its service in the country, Twitter this week launched a new privacy-protected version of its site so Russians could more easily access it. On Friday, Russian prosecutors increased the pressure on western social media by moving to designate Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, as an “extremist organisation”. There are also concerns that access to vast swathes of the wider internet, even via private networks, is going to become more difficult in Russia. Cogent Communications, which helps form the backbone of the global internet by distributing 25% of its traffic, withdrew all Russian-licensed services after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Cogent’s chief executive, Dave Schaeffer, says the company was concerned that its biggest international network connections would be “suitable for the Russian government to use for offensive cyber activities”. Lumen Technologies, a US firm in the same industry, also withdrew from Russia this week but sought to play down the move, saying it provided an “extremely small” service in Russia and still helped internet service providers route traffic into the country. NetBlocks, which monitors global internet connectivity, says there has not been a “significant dent” yet in Russia’s internet performance. But moves like Cogent’s will not ease concerns among Russians that the country’s access to the outside world could be hampered by the conflict. The loss of international internet capacity could threaten access to western news services, adds Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at Kentik, a network monitoring company. “The loss of international bandwidth capacity may negatively affect the average Russian user’s ability to connect with internet resources outside the country [like western news media]. Although to what extent remains to be seen.” Western media platforms blocked by Russia have turned to Tor, a volunteer-run network, to provide an alternative means of accessing their content. Tor allows people to access sites anonymously. This week Twitter launched a version of its service using Tor and the BBC has also reminded Russian viewers that it is available via Tor, as is Facebook – and the Guardian. The demand for VPNs from people living in Russia could also reflect a fear that the country is about to cut itself off from the global internet entirely or erect a China-style firewall to block access to sites deemed undesirable. In 2019, Vladimir Putin signalled that Russia could seek a form of internet isolation, saying “we must create a segment [of the internet] which depends on nobody”, a comment followed months later by the Kremlin confirming it had tested a domestic alternative to the global internet. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann), which coordinates the internet’s global address book, last week rejected a call from Ukraine to cut off Russia by shutting down its web domains. Nonetheless, moves are afoot to change Russia’s internet infrastructure. This week the Russian government ordered state bodies and telecoms services to use DNS servers, crucial for allowing browsers to find websites, located in Russia, although the country’s deputy digital minister said there were “no plans to disconnect the internet from inside”, instead citing concerns about cyber-attacks. “While Russia is certainly capable of cutting itself off from the global internet, the economic and social cost would be grave,” said Migliano. “What’s more likely is that the Kremlin tries to copy China’s ‘great firewall’ and strictly control all internet traffic coming in and out of the country.” The availability of western news and platforms in Russia also needs to be coupled with willingness to access them, however. Justin Crow, a researcher at the University of Sussex’s school of engineering and informatics, says the setting up of Tor sites and availability of VPNs does not mean Russians will seize a narrowing opportunity to access alternative viewpoints. “All of this also ignores the entangled questions around people’s willingness to expose themselves to risk. How much complexity and effort does the average citizen [perhaps one who has only just started to question Putin’s rule] willingly endure to find information that contradicts the official narrative, when the potential repercussions are so severe.” * The name has been changed for this article.",News/World news,Russians seek to evade social media ban with virtual private networks,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/russians-seek-to-evade-social-media-ban-with-virtual-private-networks
3/12/2022,"Aposh hot chocolate used to just mean adding marshmallows and whipped cream, but these days it is all about the cocoa percentage as retailers selling luxury single-origin drinks set out to conquer the high street. The fast-growing brand Knoops sells more than 20 different types of hot chocolate in its shops ranked by strength, from a sweet and creamy 28% white all the way up to an intense 100% extra dark. To navigate a menu that looks like a periodic table, each drink has tasting notes. Expect “notes of cherries and black tea” from the 70% single-origin chocolate from Congo while the 80%, from Uganda, is “earthy with a subtle smokiness”. Single origin refers to the fact the beans used to create it come from one source. “The feedback we get from customers is they are bored with coffee and want something new,” says the company’s founder Jens Knoop. “They want something interesting and ‘next level’, which is single-origin chocolate from around the world.” Knoop, who is originally from Germany, opened his first store in Rye, East Sussex, in 2013. Since then he has spent 10,000 hours perfecting its drinks by combining different percentage cocoas with different milks, including plant milks, as well as fruits, roots and spices. The adventurous, already familiar with chocolate strengths from sophisticated supermarket ranges, can go further still: picking from a list of 20 extras that includes Szechuan pepper, star anise, turmeric and rosemary. At 54% and above the drinks are suitable for vegans. Britons are following the same path with hot chocolate that they have trodden with coffee, according to food analysts, who point to the rapid shift from drinking instant coffee to owning coffee machines and taking out high-end bean subscriptions. This growing awareness – coupled with more time at home during lockdown – has led to bumper sales of the kit needed to make hot chocolate at home, with everything from £160 Smeg machines to £25 shakers and stirring spoons flying off the shelves. John Lewis’s hot chocolate sales more than doubled in the past six months of 2021 compared with the prior year. The market leader, Hotel Chocolat, which has blazed the trail on the high street with its posh chocolate, says it has now sold “hundreds of thousands” of its Velvetiser machine. Fans can take out a monthly subscription for its hot chocolate flakes which come in exotic flavours such as black forest gateau and Mayan chilli and cinnamon. Angus Thirwell, the Hotel Chocolat chief executive, says the only hot chocolate available used to be terrible – basically a “sugar-based powder that looked brown”. “You put a couple of teaspoons of that into a cup, poured on some boiling water and created what passed as hot chocolate for many decades in the UK. “Once people taste what can be possible, it’s synonymous with the journey from instant coffee to drinking proper coffee. It’s getting back to that authentic taste of the beans, and it applies as much to the cacao bean as it does to the coffee bean.” Knoops, which also sells its hot chocolate flakes on its website, was also a lockdown hit. “When people couldn’t go into the shops they bought our flakes and the chocolate makers to recreate the experience at home,” said Knoop. With a growing fanbase, the small chain plans to open 10 more stores in the next 12 months. In Knoops’ west London flagship store, the students Anne-Catherine Xhonneux and Dan Menendez are catching up over a 72% and a 73%. “I really like hot chocolate so I like to be able to choose the percentage,” says Xhonneux. Her drink is from Peru and promises hints of caramel and cashew and she can taste the “nuttiness”. Menendez could expect “citrus, honey and caramel”, but says his taste buds haven’t been the same since he had Covid. At weekends, troops of teenagers queue up to buy Knoop’s hot chocolate, but he says the appeal is across all ages and pockets, from office workers to gym goers, retirees and families enjoying a weekend treat. Its drinks start at about £3 but, for those brave enough to order one, a large 100% from Solomon Islands costs £6.20. After the hiatus caused by the lockdowns, Britons have sought out the experience of visiting high-street coffee shops again, says Jeffrey Young, the chief executive of consultancy Allegra Strategies, with sales approaching 90% of pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021. “If nothing else, Covid taught us that coffee shops are part of the fabric of our society,” he said. “You can get hot chocolate in most places but these premium specialists are carving out a niche.” If you take the long view, chocolate houses are not new, adds Thirlwell. “We’re rediscovering what we lost. In the 1700s in London, there were more chocolate houses than coffee shops.”",News/Business,‘People are bored with coffee’: how posh hot chocolate is conquering the UK,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/12/people-are-bored-with-coffee-how-posh-hot-chocolate-is-conquering-the-uk
3/12/2022,"States should not rush to reintroduce Covid-19 restrictions in response to a predicted surge in cases in coming weeks, health experts say, insisting that raising booster coverage of older Australians will be far more effective against the new BA.2 subvariant than masks and curbs on movement. The advice against tougher Covid rules comes after the Sydney Morning Herald reported NSW Health had recommended a return to an indoor mask mandate, working from home and density limits, as well as bans on singing and dancing, as cases in the state are expected to double. But the New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, said he was “not at all keen” to adopt the recommendations. “Bringing restrictions back in is the last possible course we want to go,” Hazzard told the Sydney Morning Herald. It was not clear whether the advice recommended reintroducing the rules – which would resemble Covid settings in place in early February – immediately, or once cases began to rise. On Saturday – a day after national cabinet moved to scrap quarantine requirements for all Covid-19 close contacts – Scott Morrison also played down the idea of states reintroducing virus restrictions. “What we’ve seen with these latest permutations of this variant is it doesn’t need to change our settings. We can keep doing what we’re doing,” the prime minister said. “We may see some more cases, but as we’ve known now, and I’ve been trying to be, trying to say for a long time, cases is not the point. How your hospital system is going is the point, and our hospital systems have held up extremely well.” Morrison declared he wanted to end the requirement for Covid close contacts to quarantine as soon as possible. “It’s starving businesses of staff ... so that rule is becoming, we believe it is redundant,” Morrison said. There were 31,721 new Covid cases announced nationally on Saturday, with 12,850 in NSW and 6,075 in Victoria. There were 22 new deaths – 11 in Victoria, six in Queensland, four in NSW, and one in South Australia. Nationally, 65.3% of the eligible population had received a booster dose. However, a federal health department spokeswoman told Guardian Australia the department did not have data readily available on the booster rate for over-50s. However, on Friday, the health minister, Greg Hunt, said the coverage rate was in the “high 90s for boosters for the over-70s”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Prof Robert Booy, a University of Sydney infectious diseases paediatrician and vaccinology expert, said it was more important to increase the booster rate than reintroduce restrictions. He said he had recently seen data that showed about 15% of people aged over 65 have not yet received their Covid-19 vaccine booster dose. “There are still these vulnerable people who aren’t yet boosted who must get boosted now,” he said. “Rather than trying to shut down society yet again, we should seek this month, even these next two weeks, to get as much of that older unboosted population their third dose, as well as anyone who is eligible for any dose to get it.” Booy said those who know they are more susceptible to the severe effects of Covid should take it upon themselves to continue to wear masks indoors and in places of poor ventilation. He added that if case loads grew to a rate where they posed a risk of overwhelming the health system if the government didn’t intervene with restrictions, then health authorities could consider reintroducing measures such as banning singing and dancing and some density limits indoors. However, Booy said current case numbers did not yet require such a decision. “I think we really need children in school and people in work. We’re not at business as usual just yet, but we’ve been heading there, and we need to move on and take advantage of our high levels of immunity,” Booy said. Prof Fiona Russell, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute and director of child and adolescent health PhD program at the University of Melbourne, agreed it was not necessary to reintroduce restrictions. She said initial data on the BA.2 subvariant that is driving an uptick in cases in NSW suggested that while it was not more severe in effect than Omicron, it was more transmissible. “The key difference is transmissibility, and that means restrictions and non-pharmaceutical interventions will have less of an impact. “There needs to be a booster blitz now, before looking at new restrictions. The really critical thing now is to get the booster dose coverage higher, especially of the older populations, because they’re who end up in hospital and are more likely to die.” She noted that deaths in Hong Kong were now “skyrocketing”, despite efforts to eliminate community spread of Covid, with its high death rate largely due to low booster rates among older residents. Russell said Australia should be aiming for a national booster rate coverage of about 95% for those aged older than 50.

What worked for previous variants just doesn’t work, however we are reassured that the vaccines work well for the subvariant,” Russell said. As well as moving to end quarantine requirements for all close contacts of Covid cases as soon as possible, national cabinet wants to transition away from PCR testing. Healthy people with mild respiratory illnesses will instead be encouraged to undertake voluntary self-isolation while symptomatic. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee will urgently review both measures and report back to the nation’s leaders.",News/Australia news,Morrison plays down fresh Covid restrictions as experts say boosters best way to tackle subvariant,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/12/morrison-plays-down-fresh-covid-restrictions-as-experts-say-boosters-best-way-to-tackle-subvariant
