12/23/2021,"World War II was a period of unprecedented industrial productivity in the U.S., especially in the aerospace industry. Operating factories 24 hours per day and six or seven days per week, the U.S. produced more than 300,000 military aircraft between 1940 and 1945. A popular claim on social media falsely claims the number of airplanes on Earth today is only a fraction of those destroyed during the war. ""No. of Planes Destroyed in WWII - 76,875,"" reads text in a Dec. 14 Instagram post from the page Books of Fact. ""No. of Planes on Earth today - 23,600."" Special access for subscribers! Click here to sign up for our fact-check text chat The post, which doesn't cite a source for the two figures, accrued more than 2,000 likes within a week. But the claim is wrong. USA TODAY reached out to social media users who shared the claim for comment. While it's unclear exactly how many planes were lost during World War II, records from the now-defunct U.S. Army Air Forces indicate at least 100,000 planes were destroyed. According to a log of equipment and personnel data compiled shortly after World War II in the Army Air Forces Statistical Digest, the U.S. lost 65,164 airplanes in combat, training accidents and other incidents between December 1941 and August 1945. The records also show the Army Air Forces destroyed 40,259 enemy aircraft during the war. That's a total of 105,423 airplanes destroyed, according to U.S. records alone. Gene Pfeffer, curator of the National Museum of World War II Aviation in Colorado Springs, Colorado, said in an email there was also a Navy air fleet that isn't accounted for in those numbers. And each country involved in the war likely lost tens of thousands of additional planes, he said. There are far more than 23,600 planes in the world today, despite what the post claims. There were 211,611 general aviation and for-hire aircraft just in the U.S. in 2021, according to data from the Federal Aviation Administration.

At 13,246 aircraft, the U.S. active fleet is the largest by far, accounting for one-fourth of the world’s military aircraft. Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that 76,875 planes were destroyed in WWII and there are 23,600 airplanes on Earth today. The Army Air Forces recorded at least 105,000 losses of U.S. and enemy planes in World War II, and an expert says the true number is likely much larger. In 2021, there were an estimated 211,611 general aviation and for-hire aircraft in the U.S. alone.

12/23/2021,"After state Rep. Delia Ramirez of Chicago announced her candidacy for Congress earlier this month, a photo was posted on the private Instagram account of a past supporter showing the candidate standing in front of a U.S. flag as she addressed her audience at Revolution Brewing. The picture from the Dec. 7 event had “@DELIA4CONGRESS” imprinted on it, with an arrow drawn in purple pointing to the candidate. A large “X” was scrawled in purple over the flag in the background. The Ramirez campaign called the posting the work of “a private individual” using a personal account and beyond the control of the campaign. But the image, sent to the Tribune by a source, was on the private Instagram account of a person well known to Ramirez and her campaign staff. The Instagram account, labeled “chibread,” belongs to Ryan Kelleher, elections director for United Working Families, a politically active progressive group that is backing Ramirez’s congressional bid. The organization’s website notes Kelleher’s history with Ramirez, which includes “going on to recruit” Ramirez to run for state representative in 2018 and acting as co-chair of that campaign. Kelleher was paid $16,412 for her campaign staff role, state campaign finance reports show. “I led the effort to #DraftDelia and went on to raise over $100,000 for the campaign from small dollar giving,” Kelleher is quoted as saying on the UWF website. “We won with over 48% of the vote in a four-way race. It was a collective victory that was the result of the work that our members and allies had been doing for years.” “Now that we know how to elect grassroots candidates, it is our job to figure out how to keep them with us by holding them accountable and setting them up to be successful,” Kelleher is quoted as saying on the group’s website. The group’s website also shows Kelleher standing at a podium in front of a Delia Ramirez legislative campaign poster. Kelleher did not respond to a request for comment on her Instagram post. United Working Families also did not respond to a request for comment. Erin Connelly, a spokeswoman for the Ramirez congressional campaign, said Kelleher was not employed by the campaign and that the flag image “was not shared by the campaign or campaign staff.” “This is not a campaign statement,” Connelly said. “It’s not something the campaign condones. We cannot control what private individuals post on social media.” Ramirez, an assistant Democratic leader in the Illinois House, is an ally of U.S. Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, and her congressional bid has drawn support from more progressive members of the Illinois legislature and City Council. The only other announced Democratic candidate for the race is Chicago Ald. Gilbert Villegas, 36th, a Marine Corps veteran, chair of the City Council’s Latino Caucus and a founding member of the council’s Veterans Caucus. The new, sprawling 3rd Congressional District was created by legislative Democrats to give the state’s growing Latino population an opportunity to send a second Latino to Washington along with Garcia. But Latinos are not a majority voting-age group in the new district, which stretches from Chicago’s Northwest Side westward to include Latino communities in Bensenville, Addison and West Chicago. rap30@aol.com",Politics/Chicago Tribune,"After state Rep.

12/23/2021,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Researchers studying the wreckage of the last U.S. slave ship, buried in mud on the Alabama coast since it was scuttled in 1860, have made the surprising discovery that most of the wooden schooner remains intact, including the pen that was used to imprison African captives during the brutal journey across the Atlantic Ocean. While the upper portion of the two-masted Clotilda is gone, the section below deck where the captured Africans and stockpiles were held is still largely in one piece after being buried for decades in a section of river that hasn't been dredged, said maritime archaeologist James Delgado of the Florida-based SEARCH Inc. At least two-thirds of the ship remains, and the existence of the unlit and unventilated slave pen, built during the voyage by the addition of a bulkhead where people were held as cargo below the main deck for weeks, raises questions about whether food and water containers, chains and even human DNA could remain in the hull, said Delgado. “It's a stunning revelation,” he said in an interview. Reporter Nicole Ellis visits Africatown, Ala., following the discovery of the Clotilda, the last known slave ship to arrive on U.S. shores. She retraces how it was found and discusses its significance with Americans whose ancestors were smuggled onto the ship. The discovery enhances the research value of the Clotilda’s remains and sets them apart from all other wrecks, Delgado said. The finding was confirmed in a report that was provided to The Associated Press and led to the site becoming part of the National Register of Historic Places in November. “It’s the most intact (slave ship) wreck ever discovered,"" he said. ""It’s because it's sitting in the Mobile-Tensaw Delta with fresh water and in mud that protected it that it's still there.” For Joycelyn Davis, a sixth-generation granddaughter of African captive Charlie Lewis and vice president of the Clotilda Descendants Association, the story of what happened more than 160 years ago is best told through the people who were involved, not a sunken ship. But she said she's excited to learn more about what has been discovered, adding: “I think it's going to be a surprise for us all.” The Clotilda was the last ship known to transport African captives to the American South for enslavement. Nearly 90 feet (27 meters) in length, it departed Mobile, Alabama, for an illegal trip to purchase people decades after Congress outlawed such trade in 1808. The ship had been sent across the ocean on a voyage financed by a wealthy businessman whose descendants remain prominent in Mobile. The Clotilda's captain transferred its human cargo off the ship once it arrived in Alabama and set fire to the vessel to hide evidence of the journey. But most of the ship didn't catch fire and remained in the river. Shown on navigational charts since the 1950s, the wreckage was publicly identified as that of Clotilda in 2019 and has been explored and researched since then, Delgado said.  The state has set aside $1 million for preservation and research, and additional work planned at the site in early 2022 could show what's inside the hull, Delgado said. But far more work is needed to determine whether the ship could ever be pulled out of the mud and put on display, as some have suggested. “Generally, raising is a very expensive proposition. My sense is that while it has survived, it is more fragile than people think,” said Delgado. “A recovery could be a very delicate operation and also a very expensive and lengthy process.” Freed after the South lost the Civil War, some of the enslaved Africans who were transported to America on the Clotilda settled in a community they started called Africatown USA a few miles north of downtown Mobile.  A documentary about the now-impoverished community by Alabama-born filmmaker Margaret Brown titled “Descendant” will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January, and descendants of the Clotilda captives are planning an annual gathering in February. Work is underway on a new museum that's meant to be a catalyst for tourism and new development in the area. ___ Reeves is a member of AP's Race and Ethnicity Team.",U.S./Associated Press,Research: Wreck of last US slave ship mostly intact on coast,https://news.yahoo.com/research-wreck-last-us-slave-164246948.html
