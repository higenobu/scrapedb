3/16/2022,"Ukrainian snipers had a problem: Russian forces in eastern Ukraine were trying to blind them. As the Ukrainians were looking through their scopes in order to find their targets, the Russians had begun pinpointing their location using the glare of the glass, and were shooting high-energy lasers into them, damaging the snipers’ eyesight. The two sides were squaring off in close proximity. In early 2014, Russia had already invaded and annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula. Shortly thereafter, pro-Russia insurgents in the eastern Donbas region began a grinding secessionist war against Kyiv. Russian troops soon entered the fray. So, quietly, did the CIA. As the battle lines hardened in Donbas, a small, select group of veteran CIA paramilitaries made their first secret trips to the frontlines to meet with Ukrainian counterparts there, according to former U.S. officials. CIA paramilitaries soon concluded that, in Russia and its proxies, the agency was facing an adversary whose capabilities far outmatched the Islamist groups that CIA had been battling in the post-9/11 wars. “We learned a lot real quick,” says a former senior intelligence official — including about the Russians’ laser-blinding techniques. “That s*** wouldn’t happen with the Taliban.” Since Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine last month — which transformed a long-simmering, attritional conflict into an explosive, all-out war — the Ukrainian military has defied predictions of a rapid collapse, holding key cities against the Russian advance and inflicting punishing losses to Russian troops and materiel. The Ukrainian military has claimed to have killed three Russian generals, including at least one reportedly eliminated by sniper fire. (Yahoo News could not independently verify whether the Russian commanders were killed by CIA-trained troops.) At least some of the fierce resistance by Ukrainian forces has its roots in a now shuttered covert CIA training program run from Ukraine’s eastern frontlines, former intelligence officials tell Yahoo News. The initiative was described to Yahoo News by over half a dozen former officials, all of whom requested anonymity to speak freely about sensitive intelligence matters. The program was run under previously existing authorities for the CIA and did not require a new legal determination for the agency, known as a covert action finding, according to a former national security official. After Russia’s 2014 incursion, the U.S. military also helped run a long-standing, publicly acknowledged training program for Ukrainian troops in the country’s western region, far from the frontlines. That program also included instruction in how to use Javelin anti-tank missiles and sniper training. Yahoo News reported in January on the CIA’s secret U.S.-based training initiative for Ukrainian special operations forces and other intelligence personnel. That program, which began in 2015, also included instruction in firearms, camouflage techniques and covert communications. Yahoo News’ prior report also revealed that CIA paramilitaries had traveled to eastern Ukraine to assist forces loyal to Kyiv in their fight against Russia and its separatist allies. U.S. officials previously denied to Yahoo News that the CIA training programs were ever offensively oriented. “The purpose of the training, and the training that was delivered, was to assist in the collection of intelligence,” said a senior intelligence official. Until now, however, the details of the CIA’s paramilitary training program on Ukraine’s eastern frontlines have never been revealed. This initiative, say former agency officials, has helped battle-hardened Ukrainian special operations forces for the current Russian assault, which has plunged Europe into its worst conflict in decades. (The CIA declined to comment. The National Security Council referred queries to the CIA. The Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not return a request for comment.) *** When CIA paramilitaries first traveled to eastern Ukraine in the aftermath of Russia’s initial 2014 incursion, their brief was twofold. First, they were ordered to determine how the agency could best help train Ukrainian special operations personnel fight the Russian military forces, and their separatist allies, waging a grinding war against Ukrainian troops in the Donbas region. But the second part of the mission was to test the mettle of the Ukrainians themselves, according to former officials. The agency needed to determine the “backbone” of the Ukrainians, said a former senior CIA official. The question was, “Are they going to get rolled, or are going to stand up and fight?” recalled the former official. The Ukrainians, the CIA paramilitaries reported back to their superiors, were indeed ready for battle. The CIA operatives taught their Ukrainian counterparts the best skills for irregular warfare, said the former senior intelligence official. “We tried to really focus on operational planning, then really hard military skills like long-range marksmanship — not just the capacity to do it, but to know how to do it on a battlefield, to really deplete the leadership on the other side,” said the former senior intelligence official. Because of the sensitivities of the mission, the agency chose to send experienced, mature operatives, recalled former officials. The thinking was, “one miscalculation, one overzealous paramilitary guy, and we’ve got ourselves a problem,” said the former official. “Everything we did in Ukraine had a chance to be misinterpreted, and escalate the tensions.” Accompanying the more strategic-minded, veteran paramilitaries sent by the agency were tactical specialists, like snipers, who also worked for the CIA Special Activities Center. But after over a decade focused on the war on terror, the high-tech battlefield environment was a shock to the CIA. Russian soldiers and their proxies were using drones, cell towers and other equipment to triangulate the phones and electronic devices of the Ukrainians and CIA paramilitaries on the frontlines — and then rapidly targeting them with that information, according to former officials. Ukrainians soldiers “were using mobile phones in a trench,” recalled a former intelligence official. “People were getting blown to bits.” It was “almost like SkyNet in a ‘Terminator’ movie — that’s what the eastern edge of Ukraine started looking like,” says the former senior CIA official, referring to the malevolent, self-aware, weaponized artificial intelligence system in the Arnold Schwarzenegger films. The Russians’ operations on the frontlines would evolve rapidly in response to the Ukrainians’ and the CIA’s own there, according to former officials. CIA paramilitaries needed to make quick adjustments, recalled former officials. Agency officials were forced to develop new modes of secure communications systems so paramilitaries could “communicate and then move before you get the direction finding from the Russians” and “they start[ed] rocketing the crap out of you,” recalled the former senior official. The CIA assembled a special working group to solve the tradecraft challenges that arose from working in eastern Ukraine. The environment was unique, where “Moscow rules” — that is, the need for extreme operational care, because of the Russians’ counterintelligence capabilities — converged with an active war zone. “We were caught with our pants down,” says the former senior CIA official. But the agency soon developed new tools to ensure that agency paramilitaries could transmit information to each other securely on the frontlines, as well as to Washington, without tipping off the Russians. Agency paramilitaries also shared some of these techniques with their Ukrainian counterparts. And the rules of the agency’s engagement on the Ukrainian frontlines was clear: Advise and train, but do not take part in combat yourself, recalled former officials. The agency impressed upon the CIA paramilitaries traveling to the front that “the Ukrainians have very effective special operations,” recalled the former senior intelligence official. The directive was, “Your job is to make them more effective.” CIA officials believed that “just sending six guys to be six snipers is not really going to be something that’s going to affect the battle space,” recalled this official. “Our job is to have an exponential impact; it’s not to get our badge for shooting a Russian or something.” Still, shortly after Donald Trump took office in 2017, National Security Council officials were concerned that, though the CIA paramilitaries in Ukraine were prohibited from engaging in combat, the parameters of their mission, which had begun under the Obama administration, were ambiguous. “We worried that the authorities might be too far-ranging,” said a former national security official. One big question was, “How far can you go with existing covert action authorities?” recalled the former official. “If, God forbid, they’ve shot some Russians, is that a problem? Do you need special authorities for that?” White House officials also worried about what might happen if CIA operatives were captured by pro-Russian forces on what was supposed to be a secret mission, recalled the former official. The discussion about the agency’s program was part of a broader review at the Trump White House of U.S. support for Kyiv — and what Moscow’s red lines might be, recalled the former official. “There was a school of thought that the Russians spoke the good old language of proxy war,” and that the CIA’s covert (as well as the military’s acknowledged) training programs and the U.S.'s overt supplying of weapons to Ukraine were therefore within historically acceptable bounds, the former official said. CIA leadership and White House officials both understood — but still fretted over — the risks. “I don’t know how we didn’t get anybody injured, to be honest,” says the former senior intelligence official. But the covert nature of the mission ensured deniability. U.S. officials “wouldn’t want to say, We just had a CIA officer killed by a Russian” in Ukraine, recalled the former official. “That would put the president or the White House in a very bad position.” The Ukraine-based CIA program operated for years, according to former officials. But as the threat of a large-scale Russian invasion became increasingly acute last month, the Biden administration, still feeling the sting of the Afghanistan withdrawal, pulled all CIA personnel out of the country, including war-zone-hardened agency paramilitaries, according to a former intelligence official in close touch with colleagues in U.S. government. The administration was “terrified of even clandestine folks being on the frontline,” says the former official. But even if the CIA’s cadre of paramilitary trainers are no longer in Ukraine, the effect of the agency’s training programs — both in the U.S. and on Ukraine’s eastern front — “cannot be overestimated,” said the former senior CIA official. These elite units trained by the agency have created “a strong nucleus” for Ukraine’s larger military forces today, according to this official. In addition to the hard skills these operatives are bringing to the fight with Russian troops, some of the benefits are more intangible, according to former officials. The CIA-trained special operations units set an example by “getting some small wins” and by “providing some success stories” for the larger Ukrainian military, says the former senior official. Courage can be contagious, notes the former official. So then, empowered by their comrades’ victories, “you get people that are charging to the sounds of the gunfire.”",World/Yahoo News,Exclusive: Secret CIA training program in Ukraine helped Kyiv prepare for Russian invasion,https://news.yahoo.com/exclusive-secret-cia-training-program-in-ukraine-helped-kyiv-prepare-for-russian-invasion-090052743.html
3/16/2022,"By Jason Lange and Andy Sullivan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the days after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, dozens of companies said they would suspend political donations to Republican lawmakers who had backed then-President Donald Trump's baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election. More than one year later, Republicans in the House of Representatives who voted to challenge the election results have so far collected about half as much corporate cash as they did at this point in the previous election cycle, a Reuters analysis of campaign finance records shows. By contrast, corporate donations are up about 10% to House Republicans who voted to certify President Joe Biden's victory over Trump. The results indicate that the corporate boycott is not just limited to the dozens of companies that announced a halt to donations after the attack. Hundreds more have also scaled back their support, the Reuters analysis shows. The shift illustrates the growing gulf between business interests and the right wing of the Republican Party, which under Trump's presidency grew more anti-establishment and more open to curbs on global trade and technology that would have been anathema in previous years. ""You've got members that are increasingly unmoored from commercial corporate interests and are more responsive to either a small number of very wealthy, deep-pocketed donors, or a large number of culture war-activated base voters,"" said Jon Lieber, a former staffer for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell now at the Eurasia Group, an analysis firm. The drop in corporate donations is unlikely to affect Republican prospects in the November congressional elections. The party is favored to win control of the House and possibly the Senate, in part due to Biden's sagging popularity, and because few Republican incumbents face competitive races of their own. Reuters analyzed the 2021 campaign finance disclosures of 142 House Republicans who are running for re-election in November and were in office throughout the last election cycle. The analysis included both re-election funds and those raised by leadership committees, which lawmakers use to finance other political activities. The analysis focused on the House of Representatives where most Republicans voted against certifying Biden's victory, compared to only eight Republicans in the Senate. Fundraising by the House Republicans remains robust - about $200 million in 2021. Both objectors and non-objectors to Biden's win brought in more money than in 2019. Corporate dollars - which don't come directly from company coffers but are contributed by employees to fundraising groups controlled by the corporations - made up about a tenth of that 2021 amount. Their role in campaign finance has diminished over the last decade as the advent of online fundraising has made it easy to solicit donations from rank-and-file voters. Lawmakers who objected to Biden's 2020 victory raised around $9 million from corporate groups in 2021, less than half of the roughly $19 million raised in 2019. Corporate money raised by those who did not object rose to about $14 million last year from nearly $13 million in 2019. NO REGRETS Even before the Jan. 6 attack, many companies steered clear of some of the most confrontational partisans. Representative Matt Gaetz, who frequently appeared on cable television to praise Trump, raised only about $30,000 from corporate sources in 2019, out of the $1 million he netted in total. He took in no money from corporate political action committees (PACs) in 2021 after voting to challenge the election results - but he raised about $4 million overall. His office did not respond to a request for comment. Others have taken a steeper hit. Representative Mike Kelly, a senior member of the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, collected about $460,000 in corporate donations in 2019. But after the Pennsylvania Republican launched an unsuccessful lawsuit to overturn Biden's victory in his state and voted against certifying the election result on Jan. 6, he took in just over $110,000 in corporate donations last year - about 75% less. Melanie Brewer, Kelly's campaign manager, said he did not regret his vote. ""While fundraising was difficult for many Republicans in 2021, it was more important that he reflected the values and ideals of his district,"" she said. The chamber's top two Republicans, Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise, also saw steep drops in their corporate donations after voting against the Jan. 6 results. Neither responded to a request for comment. However, companies continue to give to Republican election accounts that will help the wider party, helping these accounts keep up with fundraising by Democrats. The National Republican Congressional Committee raised $140 million overall in 2021, on par with the $146 million raised by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Both groups raised more in 2021 than in 2019. TECH, FINANCE FIRMS CUT OFF SUPPORT The drop in corporate support for those who challenged the election masks significant differences among industries. Eight of the largest corporate donors ahead of the 2020 election have cut off donations entirely to those who challenged the election results, records show. Those companies are all in technology, finance or consumer goods - Alphabet Inc's Google, Microsoft Corp, Lowe's Companies Inc, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp, Prudential Financial Inc, Citigroup Inc and General Electric Co. All either did not respond to a request for comment or declined to comment. Most of them announced in early 2021 they were suspending contributions to those who challenged the election results. Donating to those lawmakers ""could really incite a bunch of their key stakeholders - like employees, suppliers, customers and so on,"" said Russell Crook, an expert on corporate political activity at the University of Tennessee. Some announced boycotts, only to abandon them. Walmart Inc, which did not make any contributions in 2021 to the objectors, gave them $10,000 in January, split between McCarthy, Scalise and two others who voted against accepting the results. Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the company changed its stance because it felt it could better advocate for its interests ""by engaging with policymakers from both parties."" By contrast, many defense contractors, whose profits depend on spending decisions made in Congress, have continued their support of all Republicans, whether or not they challenged the election results. Two of them - Boeing Co and BAE Systems PLC - actually increased their donations to those who voted to challenge the election. Boeing did not respond to a request for comment and BAE declined to comment. Rock Holdings Inc, the parent company of mortgage lender Rocket Mortgage, roughly doubled its contribution to objectors in 2021, to at least $97,000. The company did not respond to a request for comment. Boeing, BAE and Rock also increased donations to those who did not object to the election result. Some Republican lawmakers reacted angrily last year when corporate representatives told them they would not get their support, according to a Republican strategist who directs business donations to lawmakers. But those tensions have eased in recent months as Republicans have grown more confident of victory and less interested in picking fights with possible allies, the strategist said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

3/16/2022,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who apparently feels threatened by teenagers wearing PPE in his presence, has seemingly found his backbone when it comes to trying to disenfranchise Black voters.

NBC News reports that as Florida’s legislative session ends, DeSantis–who plans to run for the White House in 2024–is likely to call legislators back for a special session in an attempt to force them to take up his own voting map, which would eliminate two Congressional seats currently held by Black Democrats. The seats in question, currently held by Rep. Val Demings and Rep. Al Lawson, remained intact under a map adopted by the Florida legislature, which is controlled by Republicans.

That–along with state law and a Florida Supreme Court ruling against his own redistricting effort–should have meant that both seats were safe when the legislature left them along following the 2020 census. But DeSantis has promised to veto the legislature’s map anyway, something no governor has ever done before to a map draw by members of their own party.

DeSantis is hinging his presidential bid on appealing to conservatives who have largely bought into ex-president Donald Trump’s Big Lie of mass voter fraud, and who have worked around the country to curtail Black voter participation, so he’s willing to push members of his own party off a cliff to score political points.
 From NBC NewsNow Republicans are bracing for DeSantis to keep his promise and haul them back into a special session, worrying that he might hit the campaign trail and use his popularity and the bully pulpit to bring election-year pressure on those who bucked him.Dragging legislators back to Tallahassee, which would be the ultimate power play for DeSantis, is on brand for a governor who became a top 2024 Republican presidential contender — second only to former President Donald Trump — for his willingness to fight anyone who hints at crossing him. According to NBC, Florida voters in 2010 passed amendments to the state constitution which “prohibit legislators from intentionally drawing seats that favor or disfavor incumbents or parties or reduce the ability of minority voters to elect candidates of their choice.” DeSantis, apparently, does not care.

DeSantis is taking a page out of Trump’s wanna-be strongman political playbook, bucking a legislature controlled by his own party that for the most part has given him whatever he wants and refused to criticize him, even when he bullied teenagers for wearing protective masks that their parents told them to wear.

Among other gifts feal Republicans in his legislature have delivered to DeSantis: passed his election police force, designed to investigate and prosecute non-existent voter fraud, passing his homophobic “Don’t Say Gay” law and his ban on teaching Critical Race Theory, which isn’t actually taught in any school in Florida.

3/16/2022,"Despite shooting down nearly 70 Russian airplanes and another 80 helicopters, the Ukrainian air force has suffered its own losses that have given the Russians an even more decisive 10-to-1 advantage in the air, threatening a “catastrophe” for his country, a top Ukrainian general said on Tuesday. The loss of its own fighter jets and other aircraft has made it all the more urgent that Ukraine receive Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland and that NATO impose a no-fly zone over at least some regions of the country, said Col. Gen. Serhii Drozdov, the former chief of the Ukrainian air force and a key member of the country’s defense ministry, in an interview for the Yahoo News “Skullduggery” podcast. “We have lost many aircraft, and we must increase our capability,” said Drozdov. “If Ukraine wants to have victory, we must think about Ukraine’s skies being protected. We cannot defend ourselves without a full arsenal.” Drozdov’s plea for more military assistance is expected to be repeated Wednesday when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is scheduled to address a joint session of the U.S. Congress. So far, however, the Biden administration has been adamantly opposed to both the MiG fighter jet transfer and a NATO no-fly zone, fearing that such moves would risk a direct confrontation between the United States and Russia. While not disputing Drozdov’s estimate on Russian versus Ukrainian airplane casualties, a Pentagon spokesman declined to provide any details. “This is not our war, and we’re not going to be in a position to give operational updates,” the spokesman said. Drozdov discounted one reason that has been cited for rejecting the MiG transfer: a lack of trained Ukrainian pilots to fly them. He pointed out that he flew the Soviet-era MiGs himself, and there are many others in the Ukrainian air force capable of doing so. “Now, we have many pilots who have no aircraft,” he said. “We have enough pilots, not enough planes.” Drozdov also offered a somewhat modified request for a no-fly zone, suggesting that it is currently needed, not necessarily for the entire country, but for at least two distinct purposes: to protect humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians and for the protection of Ukrainian nuclear power plants, two of which — in Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia — are now under control of the Russians. He pointed out that the Zaporizhzhia plant — the largest of its kind in Europe — was hit by a projectile when the Russians first attacked it and that in recent days the Russians have blown up ammunition nearby. He also suggested the ammunition explosion could signal a Russian willingness to destroy one of the plants and cause a radiation leak or worse. “We don’t ask our allies to fight Russia,” Drozdov said. “We ask for the protection of civilians and the prevention of an international nuclear catastrophe.”",World/Yahoo News,Ukrainian general says Polish MiG fighter jets and no-fly zone are desperately needed to counter Russian gains,https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-general-says-polish-mi-g-fighter-jets-and-no-fly-zone-are-desperately-needed-to-counter-russian-gains-193718133.html
