5/2/2022,"Oliver Knussen died unexpectedly four years ago, robbing British music far too soon of one of its most vital and influential figures. Knussen would have been 70 next month, and the London Philharmonic’s celebration of him as both composer and conductor was a timely reminder of how much he is missed. Edward Gardner devoted the first half of his concert to three of Knussen’s own works, and the second to two composers who, in very different ways, had meant so much to him – Britten and Ravel. Flourish with Fireworks, the four-minute concert opener that Knussen composed for the London Symphony Orchestra in 1988, epitomises the brilliance and densely packed invention of so much of his music. It teems with detail, yet remains lucid and utterly approachable, while the equally intricate orchestral accompaniments to the four Whitman Settings, composed in 1991, form webs of glittering sound that buoy up the soaring vocal lines. Sophie Bevan was the soprano, fully in command of the songs’ almost operatic range, but not quite so convincing in her projection of their admittedly impacted texts. The soloist in Knussen’s Horn Concerto should have been Ben Goldscheider, but he had been stricken with Covid 24 hours before the concert, and in his place came 19-year-old Annemarie Federle, who was a finalist in the 2020 BBC Young Musician competition and is currently a student at the Royal Academy of Music. Her performance was astonishingly assured. The concerto is one of Knussen’s more enigmatic works, haunted by Mahlerian ghosts and ending with a tiny almost tragic processional, but it has its quota of brilliance, too, including a cadenza that Federle projected superbly. For the second half, Gardner had made his own selection of music from Britten’s only ballet, The Prince of the Pagodas, a work that Knussen championed and in many ways rehabilitated with a superb 1990 recording. If this sequence of bleeding chunks sometimes seemed rather perfunctory, the music is also atypical Britten, with just the occasional identifiable fingerprint (mostly in the string writing) and a lot more that seems close to pastiche. But there were no problems with the second suite from Ravel’s Daphnis et Chloé, which Gardner and his orchestra made to dart and glitter with almost savage intensity.",Arts/Music,LPO/Gardner review – timely celebration of the brilliance of Oliver Knussen,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/02/lpo-gardner-bevan-federle-review-timely-celebration-of-the-brilliance-of-oliver-knussen
5/2/2022,"More must be done to protect councillors from abuse, according to local government bodies, as those on the frontline of local democracy describe a “truly toxic” political environment where online aggression spills over into real-life behaviour. Candidates for council elections on Thursday across the UK have shared their experiences of escalating hostility as the chair of the Local Government Association (LGA), councillorJames Jamieson, warned that “an increasing number … are being subjected to abuse, threats and intimidation both online and in-person, undermining the principles of free speech, democratic engagement and debate”. In Scotland, the local authority umbrella body Cosla is working with Police Scotland to develop personal safety briefings for the new cohort of councillors, a move welcomed by Pippa Hadley, who is standing for re-election as a Scottish Green councillor in the Highlands. Hadley was assaulted on the street by a member of the public last year who told her she was “a cow who should be shot against a wall”. The man was later charged and received a custodial sentence. “The whole point of being a local councillor is that people know who you are but that also makes you more vulnerable,” says Hadley, who brought a motion to Highland council this spring calling for a personal safety audit for all new members after 5 May. “People do seem to be more aggressive, partly because of the effects of lockdown. It’s as if those online keyboard warriors have slipped into real life.” Graeme Campbell is walking away from a position he has held for 15 years at South Lanarkshire council after a sustained campaign of harassment, including three fire and acid attacks at his home. The former Conservative councillor is certain the attacks were carried out by criminals as a result of work he was doing in his elected role. Last month, the candidate who hoped to succeed him withdrew after an onslaught of online abuse and intimidation. “As a councillor, you need to be part of a community and by default people know where you live. As soon as you stand you are at the mercy of the public,” says Campbell. “This isn’t about one particular demographic but coming from all kinds of people. People aren’t standing for the council because of it.” Across the UK, there are similar stories and the Guardian is aware of a number of in-person incidents on the campaign trail that are the subject of police inquiries. Last week, Welsh councillors spoke out about the abuse they faced online and from colleagues that had led them to step down at this election, resulting in dozens of uncontested seats. Cosla and the LGA offer resources to councillors for handling intimidation and online abuse, and the LGA is calling for evidence of abuse across the country “to further understand the experience of councillors and to ensure robust measures can be taken to tackle this growing issue”. Arooj Shah, the Labour leader of Oldham council, had her car firebombed last year and is facing an ongoing campaign against her. She said: “The tone of political discourse has become truly toxic and this year’s election campaign is no different. I’ve faced racist and misogynist abuse, harassment, death threats and physical intimidation. “Of course, I welcome challenge on my politics – that goes with the job. But nobody should endure hatred and personal abuse in their work.” The situation is particularly stark for female council members. At the end of March, the last session of Glasgow city council closed with a motion setting out the barriers women face getting into politics, put forward by Scottish Labour’s Maggie McTernan and supported by colleagues from the SNP and Greens. “With each woman who spoke, it was like ticking off a list: online abuse, harassment, being ignored in meetings, struggling to balance work and caring,” she said. “We’ve created a situation where people are more likely to be abusive because of this antagonistic, combative political culture. It’s a problem throughout society but we should be modelling something better in politics.” The Wolverhampton Labour councillor Beverley Momenabadi says she is too scared to campaign alone and carries two alarms with her at all times – a rape alarm and a GPS alarm connected to a security centre. “Carrying those around with me regularly when I’m just carrying out my council duties and campaigning isn’t something we should have to do. But because of my experiences, I feel that I have to for my own safety.” Momenabadi said she became particularly wary of her safety after an incident a few years ago when she was followed by a man while handing out leaflets who indecently exposed himself to her. “People are obviously doing this stuff online and seeing no consequences, and I do think some of that transfers into real life. It does make me wonder how other young women must feel about wanting to take up a political position.”",News/Society,"Firebombs and death threats: councillors need more protection, say UK bodies",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/02/firebombs-and-death-threats-councillors-need-more-protection-say-uk-bodies
5/2/2022,"In the first months after Covid emerged, doctors were baffled by rare and severe responses to the virus in some children, whose symptoms included lung disease, blood clotting and heart damage. Two years later and researchers led by the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute [MCRI] in Melbourne have uncovered the proteins involved in these acute inflammatory responses in children. MCRI haematology researcher Conor McCafferty said blood samples were taken from 33 children affected by either multi-system inflammatory syndrome or acute respiratory distress syndrome after they contracted Covid-19. Children with Covid-19 who develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome often suffer from fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, skin rash, heart disease or conjunctivitis. Children who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome may suffer organ damage due to a lack of oxygen in the blood. These blood samples were compared with samples from 20 healthy children. “What we were doing was trying to look at all of the proteins in their blood,” McCafferty said. “So a lot of people hear about genomics, which is looking at all of the genes in the body. We were doing proteomics, which involved looking at all of the proteins in the blood so we could try and map out what was happening.” They found the children affected by the syndromes contained specific proteins in their blood not seen in the healthy children. “Our research was the first to uncover the specific blood clotting and immune protein pathways impacted in children with Covid-19 who developed these serious symptoms,” McCafferty said. The findings were published in the journal, Nature Communications, on Monday, with researchers discovering 85 proteins specific to multisystem inflammatory syndrome and 52 linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Knowing the specific proteins involved could improve diagnosis and lead to the development of targeted treatments for children suffering from severe Covid-19 cases. Currently, children affected are treated with intravenous immunoglobulin from donated blood, which reduces their chance of developing heart issues from one-in-four, to one-in-20. Children who do experience changes to their heart often see the issue resolve as they get older. About 1.7% of children hospitalised with Covid-19 are admitted to intensive care. Most children who contract Covid-19 have mild or no symptoms. The syndromes are so rare in Australia that researchers were sent blood samples taken from Covid-19 infected children with the syndromes receiving treatment at the Necker university hospital in France. “France had the blood samples, while we had the proteomic testing capacity here in Melbourne,” McCafferty said. “This kind of collaboration is one of the silver linings to emerge from Covid-19.”",News/Australia news,Australian researchers uncover clue to rare and severe response to Covid in children,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/02/australian-researchers-uncover-clue-to-rare-and-severe-response-to-covid-in-children
5/2/2022,"Last time around it was called The Afflicted and enjoyed a run at the 2019 Edinburgh fringe. Now the Groupwork show has been rebooted as The Hope River Girls and is looking bold and confident as it twirls its way towards the Edinburgh international children’s festival. There, it should entrance not only its target teenage market but anyone with a taste for off-centre dance theatre. In a fictionalised version of a real incident, the setting is upstate New York where, in 2012, a case breaks out of mass psychogenic illness. Without obvious cause or connection, 24 girls in a rust-belt school are beset by a disorder that causes them to dance uncontrollably. Choreographer Vicki Manderson, who co-directs with Finn den Hertog, takes that as her cue to build evolving patterns of angular movement. Closely synchronised, Amy Kennedy, Eléna Redmond, Amelia Jones and Grace Gibson begin with finger clicks and sweeps of the hair, compulsive gestures you could almost miss. As the disorder spreads, so arms swing, knees jerk and elbows jut in an involuntary dance of quiet intensity. Rather than a conventional narrative, Jake Jeppson’s script offers a set of possibilities. Fleshed out by Lewis den Hertog’s video collage of perplexed and pontificating adults, it provides no definitive explanation of the girls’ behaviour, although it hints at the stresses of growing up in a world in flux. The girls are as mystified as anyone, but by placing them centre stage, the show puts the action in their hands. They may lack the words to explain it, but in the self-absorbed ritual of their choreography, they seem to express a unified purpose and a shared sense of resolve in the face of a bewildering world.

5/2/2022,"The NHL playoffs begin Monday evening after the first complete season since 2018-19. What stories will unfold over the coming weeks? In the NHL’s post-lockout era, the Presidents’ Trophy winner – the best team through the regular season – has rarely gone on to win the Stanley Cup. It’s happened just twice – to the 2008 Detroit Red Wings and the 2013 Chicago Blackhawks, both of which were arguably near or at the height of their powers when they did it. The Florida Panthers, this year’s Presidents’ Trophy winners, are a very good team. But they’re not the ’08 Wings or the ’13 Blackhawks. On paper, the Panthers cruised through the season – their longest losing streak was just four games – not just routinely out-scoring other teams, but trouncing them. But all that hid some issues. They leave seams defensively. They’re middling on the penalty kill. They get scored on short-handed. As for goaltending? Sergei Bobrovsky can shine, but his season goals-against average (GAA) was a 2.67, putting him behind some of his playoff peers. And he’s struggled in previous postseasons, posting a 3.24 GAA and just a .899 save percentage over his playoff career. The Panthers can be beaten. The Leafs dropped out of the playoffs in the first round last year in brutal fashion, losing four 4-3 to the Montreal Canadiens after fumbling a 3-1 series lead. The embarrassing finish was made worse by the fact that the Canadiens solved Auston Matthews and his line-mate Mitch Marner, holding them both to only one goal and nine points total over seven games. Things feel different this regular season, but will there be a different outcome? Matthews made Leaf history by becoming the first to notch 60 goals in a season, all while improving his play at both ends of the ice. Marner’s skating has become mesmerising, his passing often unrivalled. But can they – and rookie line-mate Michael Bunting – lead the Leafs into the second round … or further? It feels like now or never for this Leafs team and its management. On the other side of the league, another superstar waits for playoff success. Back in January, amid their second six-game losing streak in only 35 games, the Oilers were declared to be “just too easy to play against.” Why? “They aren’t deep enough, their goaltending is lousy” and they had “too many phonies.” Now? The phonies are gone – or maybe just fired. Since ditching head coach Dave Tippett in February, replacing him with Jay Woodcroft, the Oilers have looked much different. Between 1 March and 29 April, the Oilers went 20-6–3. McDavid will finish the year as the NHL’s top points-getter by a decent margin, with his linemate Leon Draisaitl not far behind. Goaltending has improved, led by 40-year-old Mike Smith. But the playoffs have been tough for Smith in the past. And how ready are the rest of the Oilers for the likes of Colorado, Calgary, St. Louis or Minnesota? The Lightning are already in rare company as back-to-back Stanley Cup winners. Only seven other teams have managed to do it. But, fittingly, only three teams have managed a three-peat: the Montreal Canadiens, the Toronto Maple Leafs, and most recently, the New York Islanders – 39 years ago. The Lightning had a good season, but not a great one. Against top challengers like Florida and Toronto results were mixed, with the Lightning winning and losing in equal parts, often by large margins in both cases. Andrei Vasilevskiy, the best goalie in the league for years, was mostly just good enough (his title may now belong to the New York Rangers’ Igor Shesterkin). They won – enough. They were deep – enough. A few weeks ago, the feeling was that Tampa might be spent. But heading into the playoffs, they’re looking better. They went 7-3 to close the season (although their final loss was to, uh, Columbus…). Vasilevskiy looks (mostly) back on form. Steve Stamkos posted 106 points this season. They could do it, but the route is tough, via not only the Panthers, but perhaps the Carolina Hurricanes or the Rangers, too. As has been typical in the post-lockout era, the Western Conference playoff race will be a series of knife fights – exhausting, close-range combat where nobody will get out clean. With the Las Vegas Golden Knights out of the postseason this year, there are four teams capable of filling the void they’ve left open. The St Louis Blues were the last team to win the Stanley Cup before the Lightning’s double. The Blues had a mixed season prior to the all-star break and were rocky through most of March, raising questions about playoff viability. April changed that. From 28 March through 26 April, the Blues lost only three games. Two of those were in overtime and the other was to the Colorado Avalanche, the best team in the West. With three lines scoring and defence looking good, St Louis are rolling. Speaking of the Avalanche, despite losing four straight in mid-April, the rest of Colorado’s season has been near-perfect, including a January in which they lost only one game – in overtime. They might not be the strongest team hitting the playoffs, but as one of only two with more than 55 wins in the NHL this year (the other being Florida), to discount them would be a grave error. As Flames coach Darryl Sutter put it, playing the Avalanche in the postseason might just be “a waste of eight days.” Sutter’s Calgary Flames have to be pleased with a season of consistent positive play. The Flames had three 40+ goalscorers (Lindholm, Tkachuk, and Gaudreau), solid goalkeeping led by Jacob Markström, and are a significant threat in the postseason. If it weren’t for a couple other western teams like Colorado and Minnesota, the Flames might be seriously considered to take it all – the probability simulator at MoneyPuck.com figures they stand a good chance, anyway. Hardly a dark horse. The Minnesota Wild struggled through February and the first half of March (including losses to the likes of lowly Ottawa and Buffalo) but they hit a stride in the final weeks of the season, not long after they picked up veteran goaltender (and three-time Cup winner) Marc-Andre Fleury. Coincidence? Maybe. Or perhaps that success has something to do with the fact that the Wild can score – a lot. They’re in tough against the Blues in round one, but if they can squeeze through, they may see a path open up. West: My gut says we’ll see a Calgary-St Louis matchup in the Western Conference final, but my brain says it’s more likely to be a Calgary-Colorado one, with Colorado likely to make it through, though not undamaged. East: I think Tampa will have another visit to the conference final, where they could meet the Carolina Hurricanes. The teams met three times this season and Carolina won twice, but playoff Tampa Bay is different – they might still have the edge. Final: I guess the Avalanche could play Tampa Bay? In which case, it feels like the Avalanche are due.",Sport/Sport,NHL playoff preview: are the Lightning still great or just good?,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/02/nhl-playoff-preview-are-the-lightning-still-great-or-just-good
5/2/2022,"When Dabi Adesoye was growing up in Ibadan, a city of 6 million people in Nigeria, everyone called her “Eji”. In Yoruba, Adesoye’s first language, this translates roughly as “gap teeth”. It might have been a compliment – in Nigeria, a space between the top front incisors is seen as a mark of beauty, Adesoye says – but she hated hers. “The idea that people were looking at my face and the first thing they would see is this massive gap just made me feel so uncomfortable,” she says from her home in south-east London. Adesoye, who is 27 and moved to the UK five years ago, had metal braces in her teens, but they were painful and unsightly. She ended up having them removed early. The gap only grew wider. She would clamp her mouth shut for photos, until she did the opposite to make out that she didn’t care. “But, really, I’d absolutely hate the pictures,” she says. In summer 2020, Adesoye, who works in sales for a finance software company, reached for her laptop to perform what is now an increasingly common search: “adult braces”. She had become aware that orthodontics had changed radically since her childhood. For so long an uncomfortable, food-flecked rite of passage for teens, the “train tracks” of yesterday have become hi-tech, aspirational – and barely visible. Rather than submit to fixed metal or more camouflaged ceramic braces, adults are lining up to wear snug, clear plastic teeth aligners that achieve the same results. The correction process takes one or two years, requiring a new aligner with a marginally different shape every week or two. After treatment is complete, patients must wear a retainer at night for the rest of their lives to stop their teeth regressing. To the consternation of many orthodontists, anyone can order aligners online, based on a 3D scan or a DIY mould of their teeth, without even having to look at a dentist’s chair. The rise of these disruptive startups has created fissures in a traditionally slow-moving industry, as regulators try to keep up with innovation and consumer demand. While aligner technology is continually improving, the devices, which should only be removed for teeth brushing and eating, are not new. Invisalign, the biggest manufacturer of aligners, started life in a Stanford University dorm room 25 years ago. But orthodontists report booming demand recently, particularly since the start of the pandemic, as social media and the ubiquity of video calls have thrown up new mirrors in our homes. “We call it the Zoom boom,” says Anshu Sood, the co-owner of Helix House Orthodontics, a clinic in Nottingham. Sood is also the director of clinical practice at the British Orthodontic Society, where 84% of members last year reported a pandemic surge in adult patients, mostly aged 26 to 55 (Sood’s oldest patient was a 76-year-old who was sick of her grandchildren laughing at her “Nanny McPhee” smile). Sood, whose aligner patients typically pay about £4,000, says younger people who were already open to the idea of making aesthetic changes suddenly had the time and cash to achieve them. Young men are increasingly signing up; men now make up almost half of Sood’s patients, compared with about 20% only five years ago. Jack Castle, 29, a lorry salesman from Nottingham, had never had cosmetic work done, but wanted a perfect smile for his wedding. “Looking back at old pictures, I just can’t imagine getting married with those teeth,” he says. Then there are the video-callers, says Sood. “They are people in their 30s and older who don’t spend their days looking at their phones and taking selfies, and were not particularly self-conscious. But suddenly they were looking at themselves all day on screen.” Emma Burnell, 47, had aligner treatment in 2020. “My secret plan was to come out of lockdown with this amazing new smile,” she says. Like Adesoye, Burnell, a political consultant and writer, has bad memories of ineffective teenage braces. (The NHS continues to fund metal braces for under-18s who need them, but not adults, unless they have a medical reason. Teens are increasingly going private for clear aligners.) “No photos of me smiling existed at all,” Burnell says. She was resigned to a life with crooked teeth, until lockdown – during which she conducted training courses and social gatherings online – turned a niggle into a glaring issue. “Suddenly, I was just seeing my teeth the whole time.” Adesoye paid £4,000 for her treatment, which involved several appointments with an orthodontist and dozens of aligners over 13 months. “I took painkillers the first day, because there’s quite a lot of pressure, but you do get used to it,” she says. Then she waited, constantly checking mirrors in the hope the gap might begin to close. Burnell took the more direct and controversial route. In the rapidly expanding direct-to-consumer market, patients can have their teeth scanned in a high-street store, or even make their own moulds using a mail-order kit. Design software then uses the scans or moulds to print the aligners. The marketing for these services gives them the feel of a coffee subscription startup rather than a provider of serious dentistry. They have huge social media presences and paid partnerships with influencers and celebrities. But their biggest selling point is price. Direct-to-consumer aligners start at about £1,500, paid up front or in monthly instalments. Burnell went with SmileDirectClub, the biggest player in the direct market. The American company, which was founded by two friends in 2014, arrived in the UK in 2019, when it also floated on the Nasdaq stock exchange with a valuation of more than $8bn. It had revenues last year of $638m and says it has served 1.5 million customers (it won’t say how many are in the UK). As well as offering a mail-order service with DIY moulds, SmileDirectClub opened “SmileShops” in cities including London, Manchester and Glasgow, where “SmileGuides” scan teeth. “They run this wand over your jaw and mouth and show you these hi-tech pics of your teeth now, then a model of what your tooth journey will be,” says Burnell, who paid just under £1,600 after visiting a London SmileShop. SmileDirectClub says about half of its UK customers use its shops. The other half use the DIY moulds and never see anyone face to face. Regulators and orthodontist bodies are worried. Crucially, direct-to-consumer providers do not X-ray patients before prescribing aligners. “Two-thirds of your teeth sit under the gums and when you’re moving a whole tooth you don’t know what you’re bumping into,” Sood says. Unseen problems can include buried or impacted teeth or cysts, adds the dentist, who says her colleagues are starting to see patients seeking a fix after bad experiences with direct-to-consumer aligners. According to Sood, tooth decay and gum disease can also be missed – and this has been a growing problem while people have struggled to access NHS dentistry in the pandemic. (Sood says cosmetic dentistry does not affect NHS provision because NHS-funded clinics must still fulfil their contracts.) Without a full examination, including an X-ray, “the implications of moving teeth can be quite catastrophic”, says Sood, including cracked or loosened teeth. In February, the British Orthodontic Society, which is responsible for maintaining standards, published new guidance. It said aligner treatment should only follow a “face-to-face examination by an appropriate orthodontist or dentist” and that a patient must be given the name and contact details of the clinician managing their care. The General Dental Council (GDC), which regulates dentists, also says that “there is no effective substitute for a physical, clinical examination”. David Cran, who leads SmileDirectClub in the UK, tells me that SmileShop staff include GDC-registered nurses and that named dentists or orthodontists, mostly based in the US, approve care plans remotely using moulds or images of customers’ teeth before aligners are made. Dentists remain on hand if problems arise, albeit indirectly via the company’s dental care team. Cran, whose previous job was managing the Aberdeen branch of Debenhams, says SmileDirectClub, which is registered with the Care Quality Commission (this is now an industry requirement), declines to treat complex cases – about 10% of inquiries – and that it has a rating of 4.4 out of five on the reviews site Trustpilot. “There’s obviously a traditional approach to orthodontics,” says Cran when I put to him Sood’s worries about the potential problems that only a face-to-face check and X-rays can identify. “But the fact that we’re not doing those severe cases and that the imagery we take is so sophisticated means that we’re clearly able to identify underlying issues.” Not all the concerns are clinical. The startups use social media to market themselves as slick lifestyle brands. But this also brings them into contact with negative posts. In 2020, the New York Times reported that SmileDirectClub had a confidentiality agreement for US customers seeking refunds. To receive any money, unhappy customers had first to delete any negative social media posts or reviews – and withdraw any complaints to regulators. SmileDirectClub says this non-disclosure provision is “customary in both the industry and in general business practices” in the US and is not used in the UK. The company defended its strategy in the US, which has also involved suing regulators. “When we believe that there is an organised campaign to damage our reputation among consumers, dentists and/or investors, we will defend ourselves and our mission to democratise access to care every chance we get,” Susan Greenspon Rammelt, SmileDirectClub’s chief legal officer, told the New York Times. She said that fewer than 5% of customers had received a refund; Cran says the proportion is “much lower” in the UK. Burnell noticed some movement during her first four sets of aligners, but then they no longer fit her teeth. She complained and a new set arrived after six weeks. She could not fit these either and eventually got a refund. She has paused her search for a new smile. “I should have gone to the dentist, but I was being cheap and trying to cut corners,” she says. (Cran tells me he would happily make contact with Burnell to discuss her experience.) While some orthodontists have safety concerns about direct-to-consumer aligners, which, of course, are also a potential business threat, many welcome the industry shake-up. “It’s consumers who lead these trends,” says Robbie Hughes, a dentist and the founder of Dental Excellence UK, a clinic in Liverpool. “And it’s clear they want access to something fast with a minimal number of dental appointments at the right cost.” Like an independent cinema battling Netflix, Hughes, 37, has set out to offer an experience. His clinic, where prices go from about £4,000 for aligners up to £20,000 for a full dental makeover, looks like a luxury hotel spa. His patients have included celebrities such as the Liverpool manager, Jürgen Klopp. “There is this preconception that dentistry is still about old high-street buildings full of anxious patients and bad smells,” he says. “We want to change that.” Hughes had to extend his opening hours last year to meet the post-pandemic rush. Extreme whitening is also in demand and can be achieved with wafer-thin porcelain veneers. “The trend here and in other cities is to have your teeth done and let other people know you’ve had them done – and that means making them stand out,” Hughes says. Back in London, Adesoye had her teeth slightly whitened and got a small chip repaired before waiting for the aligners to do their thing. After two months, she began to notice the gap closing. “I’d be in the middle of meetings and I’d just steal moments in the bathroom and look in the mirror and be like: ‘Oh my God, I wanted this for so long and it’s happening,’” she says. It took 13 months for her two front teeth to be united. “Eji” was no more. She posted a triumphant video to her YouTube channel, Nigerian in London. Her Instagram following shot up from about 1,500 to more than 24,000. “And I don’t think it’s because of my teeth; I think it’s because of my confidence,” she says. “I’ve always tried to make funny videos and it’s only now that I’m comfortable enough to crack jokes.” Adesoye’s friends and family were stunned. “For the first three months, my mum would video-call me from Nigeria just to see my perfect teeth,” she says. Adesoye is about to get married when we speak. She met Jon, a teacher, before getting aligners. “Now I’m able to say ‘cheeeese’ as hard as I want without feeling self-conscious,” she says, laughing.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘I can’t imagine getting married with those teeth’: how Britain fell for adult braces,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/02/how-britain-fell-for-adult-braces
5/2/2022,"Deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda is unlikely to deter those in northern France hoping to cross the Channel in small boats, according to a survey that found that three-quarters said they would still try to make the journey. The snapshot survey of more than 60 asylum seekers in Calais and Dunkirk was carried out by the charity Care4Calais, which provides practical support to asylum seekers in both northern France and across the UK. When the UKgovernment announced plans to offshore some asylum seekers to Rwanda on 14 April, ministers emphasised that the controversial scheme would act as a deterrent to asylum seekers planning to cross the Channel in small boats. Asylum seekers who talked to Care4Calais said they were still prepared to take their chances. “I’m willing to risk it,” said one. “Everyone is scared in the camp but I don’t think it will affect them [the decision to cross the Channel].” Many of those interviewed fled Sudan or South Sudan and were horrified at the prospect of being flown back to a country not far from the starting point for their journey, especially after enduring the difficulties of passing through Libya, where many had to deal with traffickers, and making the dangerous crossing across the Mediterranean to Italy. “Rwanda is not good. It’s for animals, we take danger to get a safe life,” said another asylum seeker who participated in the survey. On Sunday, more than 200 people crossed the Channel in small boats after an 11-day pause due to poor weather, although the government claimed the absence of these crossings was evidence that its Rwanda plan was already having a deterrent effect. The most recent crossings, prior to Sunday’s resumption of small-boat activity on the Channel, was on 19 April, when 263 people crossed in seven boats. The offshoring plans are the subject of several legal challenges including one from Care4Calais, PCS and Detention Action. They are challenging the failure to publish details of the policy and the government decision to penalise asylum seekers based on irregular entry to the UK. Care4Calais has launched a crowdfunder for the legal action and has condemned the impact of the plans on asylum seekers on both sides of the Channel. The charity is one of several to raise the alarm that since the government announced its plans to offshore people to Rwanda dozens of asylum seekers are reported to have gone missing from hotels across the UK where the Home Office is accommodating them, because they are fearful of being rounded up and put on a plane to Rwanda. Sam Jonkers, a volunteer at Care4Calais, knows of some refugees who have vanished from hotels and says she has been deluged with text messages from asylum seekers fearful of being offshored. “The Rwanda plans are devastating for people who have left such dangerous countries and had such difficult journeys to reach the UK,” she said. “I have received hundreds of text messages from terrified asylum seekers; they can’t sleep at night because they are so worried.” One message states: “I couldn’t sleep. So frightened about what we expect to happen to us in the coming days with the Rwanda decision.” Another said: “I now think there is no such thing as human rights anywhere in the world, Neither in Iran, UK or anywhere.” While about a quarter of respondents to the Care4Calais survey in northern France said the Rwanda offshoring announcement would make them consider staying in France and seeking asylum there, many said they would continue with their plans to reach the UK. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, condemned the impact on asylum seekers in the UK of the Rwanda announcement, saying: “The government is failing in its duty of care to people in the asylum system by not recognising the devastating impact the threat of being expelled to Rwanda is having on them.” He said the government was simply treating asylum seekers it hoped to offshore as “human cargo”. Maddie Harris, of the Humans for Rights Network, is also aware that some asylum seekers have vanished from hotels since the offshoring announcement was made. She warned that many asylum seekers in the UK could go underground to avoid being offshored. “This is a policy that trades human life for money,” she said. “It is forcing people out of the asylum system into destitution due to fear of removal, drastically increasing the risk of exploitation.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “This world-leading migration and economic development partnership will overhaul our broken asylum system, which is currently costing the UK taxpayer £1.5bn a year – the highest amount in two decades. There is nothing in the UN refugee convention which prevents removal to a safe country. Under this agreement, Rwanda will process claims in accordance with national and international human rights laws.”",News/UK news,"Small boat asylum seekers undeterred by Rwanda plan, survey finds",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/02/small-boat-asylum-seekers-rwanda-uk-france-survey
5/2/2022,"Scott Morrison has criticised Labor’s new housing policy, saying the opposition “wants the government to own your home”, despite praising similar schemes in the past. Ahead of an anticipated interest rate rise on Tuesday, the prime minister has deflected questions about the impact of rising interest rates on mortgage holders, saying Australians have been preparing for a rate hike from the current historically low level of 0.1%. On Sunday, Labor announced it would support 10,000 homebuyers with a funding injection of up to 40% of a property value in a shared equity scheme that gives the government a stake in the property. Despite expressing public support for similar schemes being run by state governments and the private sector, Morrison said on Monday that the policy would see the government “effectively becoming an owner of your home”. “There are questions about this,” Morrison said. “So, what happens if you decide to renovate your home? I mean, what Labor have been very clear about is that they have a share in your home, and so, as your home value increases, they are making money off you. “As your home price goes up, your home value goes up, they are taking a cut, and so you have to pay the government back on their equity and with the capital appreciation. I mean, they are basically riding on your decision to buy your own home.” Labor’s policy is based on the Victorian and Western Australian models, which use a valuation by the valuer general to account for any increase arising from renovations that are then deducted from the amount paid back to the government when the house is sold. The Victorian Keystart program, which also requires the homeowner to seek approval for any modifications that cost more than $10,000, states that a valuer will assess any improvements made and “take those into account”. In the Keystart program “some examples of changes that may add value are adding an air conditioner, deadlocks, security screens, a bathroom or kitchen renovation, a patio, reticulation, or adding a shed”. When he was treasurer in 2017, Morrison said the Victorian government’s shared equity scheme was an “interesting” idea, and as shadow minister for housing in 2008, advocated a similar program with the private sector to “ensure mortgagees continue to have access to this viable option to reduce their mortgage burden, especially during the global financial crisis”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning When asked on Monday about his previous support for shared equity schemes, Morrison said there was a “very different set of issues” at the time arising from a credit squeeze and a lack of liquidity in the market. “So I was proffering sensible interventions that would enable the private sector to give people more choices,” he said. “I had no plan for the government to own people’s homes. “There is a scheme like this in Western Australia. There is a scheme like this in South Australia. The take-up of the schemes is very limited and one of the reasons for that is people want to own their own home,” he said. Morrison said in 2008 that a shared equity scheme between lenders and banks would reduce mortgage stress for homeowners or reduce the upfront cost of a house purchase. Ahead of expectations that the Reserve Bank will raise interest rates on Tuesday, Morrison said that he believed Australians were prepared for a rate rise, and challenged a question from a journalist who asked about “hundreds of thousands” of people facing mortgage stress. “We have got people that have moved from 20% fixed rates to 40% fixed rates, and you know what that tells me? Australians know what is going on. They know there are pressures that are coming from outside of Australia on interest rates,” Morrison said. “What I do commend the Australian people for – they have in making the choices to move to fixed rates to ensure that they can get ahead of that mortgage and to be paying down and ensuring that they have been building up buffers. “You can also see on household balance sheets hundreds of billions of dollars … as Australians have been insulating themselves over the course of the pandemic to deal with these shocks that they knew would be coming.” Campaigning in Brisbane on Tuesday, Albanese said he was confident the party’s housing policy was “good policy”. “How do we know that, because we know that it works,” he said. “In Western Australia they’ve had a similar plan now for 30 years. What it’s done is enabled people to get into housing who wouldn’t otherwise get there and it’s also produced a return to the government. “It is a very, very positive plan which is why it’s been welcomed by the Housing Industry Association, by the Master Builders Association, and it’s why as well I note that in the past Scott Morrison has been positive about it.”",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison criticises Labor’s housing policy despite praising similar schemes ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/02/scott-morrison-criticises-labors-housing-policy-despite-praising-similar-schemes
5/2/2022,"Kate Purdy sits upright, bespectacled and sensibly dressed, in a room containing an intimidatingly vast writing desk, completely unaware of how excited I am to see her. The second season of Undone, the mind-bending mental illness sci-fi comedy drama she co-created with BoJack Horseman’s Raphael Bob-Waksberg, has just come out on Amazon Prime. A few weeks ago, I was emailed a preview screener and clicked on it out of idle curiosity. I devoured the first episode. Then the second. At some point during the third, I missed a work deadline. But I carried on gulping down the episodes, slackjawed with amazement. Because, while I liked Undone’s first season, the second is phenomenal. Every element has been honed to the point of high art. The jokes are funnier. The dramatic lurches are braver. The visuals – rotoscoped and fluid – are even more breathtaking than before. It somehow manages to be several things at once. It’s an exploration of mental health that plays out like a crime procedural. It’s a meditation on the psychic wounds left by decades of generational trauma, but it’s also a wisecracking, globetrotting romp. Almost as soon as our Zoom conversation begins, I start babbling about how quickly I gobbled the season up. “It’s funny you say that,” Purdy says. “Raphael always says this is the longest meal prep of all time. You work for two and a half years, then people can watch the whole thing in six hours.” Like many other shows returning of late, for obvious reasons, Undone has been off our screens for three years, which means a recap might be in order. In the first season, Alma, a young woman played by Rosa Salazar, realises that she can manipulate time and uses this skill to investigate the circumstances of her father’s death. However, it is never made clear whether Alma’s time manipulation is actually happening, or whether it is simply a manifestation of her mental illness. Without spoiling the plot, the second season manages to embrace and abandon the premise, with Alma dragging her sister Becca (Angelique Cabral) and father (Bob Odenkirk) along for the ride, which means it feels noticeably lighter. “There are a lot more high jinks this time,” Purdy nods. “And you know, Rosa and Angelique are so fun together and play off each other so well. There’s a mystery with mom, so let’s poke around and get nosy. It almost feels like they’re two young detectives. And then it goes deeper and deeper.” Undone came into being after Purdy was tasked with writing Downer Ending, the standout episode of BoJack Horseman’s first season. In the episode, Horseman, a talking cartoon horse, enters a state of consciousness where he sees all the life paths he could have taken, along with all the opportunities he was denied due to his rampant egotism. “I brought a lot of myself to that episode,” Purdy says. “And I brought in Carl Jung’s The Red Book: Liber Novus and showed Raphael various images. After that he was like: ‘There’s more here. Figure out a show where we take some of this and explore it.’” Again, this caused Purdy to dig deep into her own life. “My grandmother was schizophrenic,” she says. “And there is depression and anxiety that runs through the family in addition to schizophrenia, and it’s something that my father never wants to talk about. The one thing he has told me was that one time he was watching Howdy Doody with his brother and sister, and his mom shoved the broom handle through the television set. So that is woven into the show. We go back to that moment over and over again, because I want to unpack that. I want to know more. That’s part of the exploration for me.” A day prior to our conversation, Netflix released the second season of Russian Doll. By total chance, it covers a lot of the same ground as Undone, in that it’s about a woman bending reality in an attempt to heal generational trauma. Having seen them both, I’d say Undone nails the assignment with much more panache and commitment. I wonder what happened to make everyone reflect on familial trauma, I say to Purdy. Perhaps the insular experience of lockdown gave people room to explore it. She smiles. “I mean, I think I’m a little more woowoo, to be honest.” Go on. “My perspective is that I really believe that we have an ancestry, and those ancestors are spirits who are guiding us and helping us,” she says. “And part of that is a collective experience. Dreams and meditative states help us touch into this deep pool of information and wisdom that is helping to guide us.” What’s fascinating about Purdy is the circuitous route she took to Undone. Her first job writing for TV was on the long-forgotten Jerry Bruckheimer procedural Cold Case, after which she jumped to the sketch show MADtv and Courteney Cox’s sitcom Cougar Town, which in turn led to BoJack Horseman. Happily, she says all of these stepping stones have helped to inform Undone. “I was watching a documentary about Georgia O’Keeffe, who actually spent a lot of time learning to paint in other people’s styles until she discovered her own style and voice. And I felt like: ‘Oh, that’s been my process,” she says. “But it was really good for me to have that experience. The practice of plotting a crime drama is something that is implemented on Undone. And sketch was really useful as a tool, because you have to come up with five ideas that are really strong every week, and then you have to write those within a week. That was its own training ground.” Undone is something you have to see to properly understand. And that’s great for viewers seeing the finished product, but getting it commissioned must have been a nightmare. Was it hard to pitch a rotoscoped comedy about generational trauma that exists in the liminal space between reality and dreams? Purdy laughs. “We wrote the first two episodes, and Amazon said: ‘We love it. It’s really fun. It feels like you’re on a mushroom trip. But what is this show?’ And so they ordered a third episode to get proof of concept. So we wrote it and they said: ‘OK, great. We love the third episode. But what is this show?’” The second season of Undone is such an incredible achievement – and so intensely personal – that it feels destined to be the thing Purdy is remembered for. But fond memories of a cultish streaming show don’t exactly pay the bills, which might be why she already has one eye on the future. She recently signed a deal with Amazon to keep making new content. “The things I’m excited to explore range from lighter teen comedy films with these important themes that are important to me woven through them,” she says when I ask what the future may hold. “But then other half-hour shows that are deeper, even into the sci-fi elements in terms of slipping reality,” she says. “I like genre-bending. I like feeling like we don’t have to stay in one tone if we make the shift elegantly. And I like always having a bit of humour that plays against the drama.” Whether intentionally or not, she just perfectly described Undone. What a treat this show is.

5/2/2022,"These six short stories are almost a novel, interlinked by characters who drift and reconnect with one another in the way friends do, living a big-city, post-university life. And this is Calder’s canvas: young adulthood, and a generation simultaneously bound to one another via social media and yet lost in a disconnected modern world. It comes, helpfully, with a glowing quote from that generation’s chronicler-in-chief, Sally Rooney, who calls Reward System “an exhilarating and beautiful book”. They’re not necessarily the two adjectives I find myself reaching for. Calder’s stories are impressively detailed in their fine-grain attention to the banal stuff-of-life and his characters’ inner agonies – from panics over not being able to remember if you locked a door to awkward social interactions in the workplace. But he writes with a cool, contemporary detachment rather than much heat. At its worst, this can mean an exhausting focus on the dead-air of city life – I could have done without the deep dive into the pointlessness of corporate office culture in Search Engine Optimisation, which says little new. At his best, however, Calder proves a tender chronicler of the digital age, tunnelling into what it feels like, moment to moment, to navigate dating apps and YouTube viewing histories and neglected WhatsApp messages. Distraction from Sadness Is Not the Same Thing As Happiness takes the reader inside an attempt to present “an exaggeratedly carefree, pretty, lite-version” of the self on a date. It is a remorseless excavation of the internal experience of harshly judging your own performance and the other person’s (although Calder’s device of only naming the characters “the male user” and “the female user” quickly grows tiresome). It’s not all harsh judgments, though: I longed to give both of Calder’s main characters, whose perspectives we get more or less of at various points, a good, hard hug. There’s Julia, a self-doubting chef, and her ex, Nick, a wannabe writer who works in a terrible office and drinks too much. Julia gets the first and by far the longest story, A Restaurant Somewhere Else, clocking in at more than 100 pages. It’s certainly the most fully realised, charting Julia’s unhealthy relationship with her boss, from creeping crush to a series of billowing red flags, told in short, atomised chapters. These are given titles that range from practical (Hours Later) to drolly emotive (How We Fail Others and Also Ourselves). Julia is extremely concerned with hiding what she believes to be her “true nature” – “a crier, pleaser and worrier” – and forms an easy target for a controlling relationship, although Calder charts the entanglement with believable subtlety, and without judgment. Each mini-chapter is a small step along a journey that – for a while at least – feels depressingly inevitable. In Better Off Alone, Nick is similarly uncertain of himself; on the way to a party, he reminds himself “of advice I’d read online about how to maximalise my likeability”, before getting blackout drunk. The book ends with a chapter set in lockdown, Julia and Nick facetiming and feeling like the future has been “indefinitely postponed”. This sense of going nowhere is well captured, but ultimately it’s shared with the collection. Calder’s stories don’t really go anywhere – like life, and like many relationships, of course. It just doesn’t necessarily make for a reading experience that is, well, especially exhilarating.

5/2/2022,"The curtain is to come down on Andrew Lloyd Webber’s new West End musical Cinderella, just under a year after opening, with its final performance set for 12 June. In a statement released on Sunday by Lloyd Webber’s Really Useful Group, the composer said “mounting a new show in the midst of Covid” had been an “unbelievable challenge” and that a new production of Cinderella would open on Broadway in 2023. Concern was expressed on social media at the way in which news of the show’s closure was released over the bank holiday weekend. Carrie Hope Fletcher, who plays Cinderella, tweeted on Sunday night: “I don’t think I have the words … Sending love to all impacted by today’s news and by how that news was delivered.” Summer Strallen, who had been due to join the Cinderella cast, said that she had found out about the early closure from reading a news story online and that her agent had been emailed the news. Luke Latchman, who had also been due to join the show, tweeted: “Imagine – planning in your head 100 times what you’re going to say when it’s announced. Telling your friends and family you have something coming and can’t wait to tell them about it. Knowing that career-changing West End lead was coming. Then you see a tweet and it’s all gone.” The Great British Bake Off winner and Strictly Come Dancing finalist John Whaite revealed on social media that he had been due to join the cast for Cinderella in July in the role of Prince Charming. He said that his “heart went out” to those working on the show. A spokesperson for the Really Useful Group said on Monday: “Everyone involved in Cinderella was contacted by call, email or in person (some through agents) before the news went live in the evening. Every effort was made to ensure people were notified before it went live, while trying to manage how quickly it would move on social media once people were informed.” No specific reasons for the show’s closure were given by the Really Useful Group but Cinderella has suffered heavy losses during its run, particularly when performances were suspended from late December to early February to avoid disruption and “protect the quality of the show” while the Omicron variant spread rapidly across the UK. The show’s arrival at the Gillian Lynne theatre in the West End was delayed by a year because of the pandemic. Government restrictions meant that Cinderella played at reduced capacity during its previews, at an estimated weekly loss of £100,000. Its official opening night was cancelled at the 11th hour last July because of a Covid case in the cast. When the show finally opened, in August, it received glowing reviews but its online booking system reveals that there are many empty seats for the remaining performances. In his statement, Lloyd Webber said: “I am incredibly proud of Cinderella. Not only did it get some of the best reviews of my career, but we led the charge to reopen the West End, ensuring that theatre and live entertainment remained relevant and in the news.” The composer – who in 2017 quit as a Conservative peer, saying he was entering the busiest ever period of his career – has been outspoken about the government’s handling of the pandemic. “We held the Government’s feet to the flames throughout their changes of heart during the pandemic,” he said in the statement. Last summer he even declared himself ready to risk arrest and open for full audiences when theatre capacities were restricted for social distancing. (Cinderella remained at a limited capacity for that period, with an estimated weekly loss of £100,000.) His total fortune, according to the Sunday Times Rich List for 2021, plummeted by £275m to £525m. Theatregoers with tickets for performances after 12 June are to be contacted by the box office or their ticket agent to discuss their options.
