12/18/2021,"A Chinese man has gone viral for his bravery in investigating the alleged Uyghur concentration camps in Xinjiang since foreign journalists are not allowed to conduct interviews in the region.

The investigation: The man, who goes by Guanguan on YouTube, created a 20-minute documentary that shows some of the locations of the alleged Uyghur concentration camps across Xinjiang.
 

 Guanguan visited several places in Xinjiang, including Fukang, Kazakh Autonomous County, Yunqi, Urumqi (Wulumuqi) and the outskirts of Korla (Kuerle), where the camps are located. About 1.8 million Uyghurs and other minorities are allegedly held without trials in these camps, which the government claims to be re-education and vocational training schools. The documentary shows that most of these compounds share similar features, such as watchtowers and razor-wire walls; however, the compound in Korla appears to be a military complex with barracks and army trucks. During his investigation, Guanguan noted that he could not give comments while filming in the locations, because he could “end up in a concentration camp if he were stopped by a police and the footage were discovered.” He also noted that some of the locations he visited were not listed on any online maps, such as those on Baidu, a prominent search engine in China. 
His method: Guanguan reportedly read a lot of international reports about the camps, and the one in particular that he used as a guide during his investigation was from BuzzFeed, Radio Free Asia (RFA) Uyghur Service Director, Alim Seytoff, said in a video about Guanguan.
 “In the past couple of years BuzzFeed has been also at the forefront to report on the camps,” Seytoff said. “He traveled from mainland China to Qumul, to Turfan, to Urumchi, to Korla – these major cities, and outskirts of major cities, using the BuzzFeed report as a guide to locate the camps.” Seytoff then noted that Guanguan managed “to find nearly 20 concentration camps throughout his travels,” and he even discovered some camps that were not mentioned in the BuzzFeed article. Alison Killing, an architect and geospatial analyst who helped with the BuzzFeed report, applauded Guanguan’s bravery in investigating the alleged camps. “The first thing that should be said is just how brave that guy was to head off to Xinjiang and to go and look for those camps,” Killing told RFA in November. “It’s really useful to have that ground-level imagery that helps us to corroborate what we’re seeing in the satellite images and helps us to confirm that what we thought we were looking at from above really is vast.” Killing, along with BuzzFeed reporter Megha Rajagopalan and programmer Christo Buschek, won a Pulitzer Prize for their stories that exposed “a vast new infrastructure built by the Chinese government for the mass detention of Muslims.” 
Other details: An independent, non-government report by more than 50 international experts in genocide, international law and Xinjiang claimed the Chinese government “bears state responsibility for an ongoing genocide against the Uyghur in breach of the (UN) Genocide Convention,” CNN reported in March.
 China reportedly denied all the assertions by international media about the camps and declared that the purpose of these establishments is to “reeducate” the Uyghur people to Chinese values].  Last week, the independent Uyghur Tribunal in London released their judgment that said in part: “On the basis of evidence heard in public, the tribunal is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the People’s Republic of China (PRC), by the imposition of measures to prevent births intended to destroy a significant part of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang as such, has committed genocide.”  Featured Image via guanguan Enjoy this content?

12/18/2021,"AOC said Democrats will not get re-elected if they don't act on student debt and pass Biden's agenda. The Senate likely won't vote on Build Back Better until 2022, causing the child tax credit to lapse. Plus, 43 million federal student-loan borrowers will have to resume payments on Feb. 1. AOC gave her Democratic colleagues a reality check: act on issues their voters care about or lose the next election. ""It is actually delusional to believe Dems can get re-elected without acting on filibuster or student debt, Biden breaking his BBB (Build Back Better) promise, letting CTC (child tax credit) lapse, 0 path to citizenship, etc,"" New York Rep. Ocasio Cortez wrote on Twitter on Friday. —Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) December 17, 2021 All those issues Ocasio-Cortez listed are ones progressive lawmakers, and Americans who voted for them, are strongly advocating for. Although it's been almost a month since the House passed President Joe Biden's $2 trillion social-spending package, which included a one-year expansion of the child tax credit for families with children, it looks like the Senate will not be voting on the package until after Christmas. Given the pushed-back timeline, not only will the $300 monthly checks per child lapse in January, but just one month later, 43 million federal student-loan borrowers will be resuming payments on their debt once the pandemic pause lifts on February 1. As Insider previously reported, many fully-employed borrowers do not feel financially secure enough to make payments next year, and per a new Data for Progress poll, 55% of voters think the payment pause should be extended since COVID-19 cases are still rising. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a recent press briefing that while the administration still plans so stay on schedule with the payment resumption, they are continuing to review the impact of the Omicron variant. Ocasio-Cortez has been one of the many progressive lawmakers urging Biden to not only extend the pause on student-loan payments, given the pandemic is ongoing, but to cancel student debt broadly for every borrower. She took to the House floor earlier this month to urge Biden to act on the $1.7 trillion crisis, and she slammed the ""ridiculous assertion"" that canceling student debt would benefit the rich. ""Do we really think that a billionaire's child is taking on student loans?"" Ocasio-Cortez said. Biden campaigned on approving $10,000 in student debt per borrower, but that promise has yet to come to fruition and voters are beginning to take notice. For example, an independent voter recently appeared on CNN to weigh in on Biden's actions so far, and she gave the president a B-minus rating for not yet delivering on his student-debt promises. ""I would definitely say he has delivered on many promises, but some of them he has not,"" Amikka Burl, an independent voter, said on CNN. ""He promised when he was actually running, on his campaign trail, that he would wipe out $10,000 worth of student-loan debt for every individual that has student loans. That has yet to come to fruition, so I am waiting for that to happen."" Aside from student-debt cancellation, the most pressing issue right now for many borrowers is being thrown back into repayment early next year, and lawmakers and advocates are working to ensure that does not happen. ""This debt is just overwhelming for people,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said last week. ""If we don't extend the pause, interest rates just pile up. Students owe a fortune. And with Omicron here, we're not getting out of this as quickly as we'd like.""

12/18/2021,"Kanye West's presidential campaign was run by a number of Republican operatives, an investigation from the Daily Beast shows. The Daily Beast reported that West's campaign received millions of dollars in services from GOP operatives. Some services were not properly disclosed, according to the Daily Beast's investigation. Kanye West's failed 2020 presidential campaign was secretly run by a number of Republican operatives who were trying to get then-President Donald Trump re-elected, according to an investigation from the Daily Beast. Federal disclosure documents reviewed by the Daily Beast appear to show that West, who ran as a third-party candidate in the 2020 election, received millions of dollars in services from GOP operatives. The documents also show some of the services were not properly disclosed, according to the Daily Beast. Government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which reviewed hundreds of court documents tied to the West campaign, told the Daily Beast that the campaign's filings were a ""disaster."" ""It's very clear that the whole point behind Kanye's campaign was to try to re-elect Donald Trump,"" the organization's communications director, Jordan Libowitz, told the Daily Beast. ""Whether that was a goal of Kanye is another issue. But he was clearly seen as a way to steal potential votes from Biden."" West, a former supporter of Trump announced in July 2020 that he was running for president, but missed the deadline to register to appear as a candidate on ballots in a number of states.
