12/15/2021,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday withdrew his senatorial candidacy in next year’s elections in his latest change of mind over what he plans to do after his turbulent term ends, when critics say he would likely face an array of lawsuits for an anti-drugs crackdown that has left thousands of mostly petty suspects killed. Accompanied by his executive secretary and security escorts, the 76-year-old Duterte went to the Commission on Elections in Manila and withdrew as a senatorial candidate. His former aide, Sen. Bong Go, separately appeared at the elections commission earlier Tuesday to withdraw his presidential candidacy, which he said his family opposed. Duterte did not give any reason for the move but his spokesman, Karlo Nograles, said it would allow the president to better focus on managing the pandemic in the country and ensuring that the May elections would be peaceful and orderly. Known for his extra tough approach to criminality, Duterte launched a police-enforced campaign against illegal drugs when he took office in June 2016. The crackdown has left more than 6,000 mostly petty suspects dead based on police figures. Manila-based analyst Richard Heydarian, however, said Duterte’s latest move showed how the president, who faces potential criminal suits after his presidency for his deadly anti-drugs campaign, seemed to have lost his political footing after his plan to ensure a friendly succession next year caved in. “Duterte is really scrambling for any kind of leverage in next year’s elections,” Heydarian said. “His initial plan to engineer a succession for one of his anointed successors is now totally out of the window.” Duterte initially wanted his daughter, Mayor Sara Duterte of southern Davao city, to succeed him but she refused to run for the presidency amid unspecified differences with her father. She later decided on her own to run as the vice-presidential running mate of Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son of the late Philippine dictator. The president later encouraged Go, his former longtime aide who is now a senator, to run for president. But Go eventually backed out, saying he did not aspire to be president and that his family opposed his presidential candidacy. Duterte originally considered running for the vice presidency but later dropped the plan, saying he planned to retire when his term ends and added that surveys showed most Filipinos did not support such a move. Philippine presidents are constitutionally limited to a single, six-year term and Duterte’s initial plan to seek the vice presidency sparked a debate about the legality of such a move, which could have seen him catapulted back to the top position if the next president dies or becomes incapacitated for any reason. Duterte then filed his candidacy for a Senate seat last month, walking back on his earlier vow to retire from politics after his presidential term ends. Human rights groups said last month that Duterte was somehow bracing to evade accountability for rights abuses while in power by planning to remain in public office. Deaths linked to Duterte's anti-drugs campaign has sparked alarm in Washginton, and led to an International Criminal Court investigation. The ICC probe has been temporarily suspended at the request of the Duterte administration. At least five key candidates are running to succeed Duterte, including Vice President Leni Robredo, who leads the opposition, and Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son of the late dictator, who was toppled in a 1986 “people power” pro-democracy uprising. Robredo narrowly defeated Marcos Jr. in the 2016 vice presidential race in an outcome that he unsuccessfully challenged.",World/Associated Press,Philippine leader quits from Senate race in latest flip-flop,https://news.yahoo.com/philippine-leader-quits-senate-race-112632495.html
12/15/2021,"Former top Trump aide Stephanie Grisham says Trump is likely furious with Mark Meadows. Meadows initially cooperated with the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. The records Meadows turned over shed new light on his integral role in Trump efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Since publishing a scathing tell-all memoir detailing her years as one of Donald and Melania Trump's closest aides, Stephanie Grisham has used her platform to publicly condemn the former president and his allies and offer insight into their thought processes and motivations. On Monday night, she tweeted that Trump is likely furious with his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, for initially cooperating with the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot. Meadows produced more than 9,000 documents to the Committee shedding new light on his integral role in Trump's effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Last week, Meadows reversed course and defied the Committee's demand that he sit for a deposition. Rep. Liz Cheney, a Republican on the bipartisan panel, on Monday night read out text messages Meadows received on Jan. 6 from Donald Trump Jr. and several Fox News hosts urging the then-chief of staff to get Trump to condemn the rioters and call for peace amid the Capitol breach. Grisham, who quit her job as Melania's chief of staff on Jan. 6, tweeted that newly-revealed messages made her ""stomach turn"" and that she's hoping for ""substantial punishment for all involved."" ""Trump's anger level has got to be through the roof right now,"" Grisham wrote, adding three fire emojis, ""Not that it matters AT ALL, but I can absolutely picture his reaction & I promise it's not pretty."" Grisham declined Insider's request to comment on the record. In one text, Trump Jr. wrote to Meadows, ""He's got to condemn this shit ASAP."" In another the president's son told Meadows that his father ""has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand."" The Select Committee voted unanimously on Monday to recommend that Meadows be charged with criminal contempt of Congress for defying its subpoena. Reports emerged last month that Trump was angry with Meadows after he revealed in his new memoir that Trump tested positive, and later negative, for COVID-19 prior to his first in-person debate with Joe Biden in September 2020. The bombshell news undermined Trump's claim that he only tested positive for the virus three days after the debate and suggests that the former president recklessly endangered hundreds of people, including Biden, by potentially exposing them to the deadly virus. After Meadows announced he would no longer cooperate with the Committee earlier this month, Grisham tweeted, ""Translation: Trump is pissed about his book, so now Meadows is doing all he can to get back in his good graces."" Starting as a press aide on the Trump campaign in 2016, Grisham steadily rose through the ranks in Trump world, ultimately serving as White House press secretary and a top aide to the first lady. In her memoir, ""I'll Take Your Questions Now,"" she describes the Trump White House as deeply chaotic and incompetent and writes that she and other staffers ""got heady with power"" and ""didn't think about serving the country."" She quit says she's ""terrified"" of a second term of Trump. Both the former president and first lady have denounced Grisham, calling her incompetent, ""deceitful,"" and ""troubled,"" in recent months.

12/15/2021,"More than 60 faculty members at USC have signed an open letter urging the university’s leadership to “publicly and explicitly rebuke” a student for several inflammatory comments she made online earlier in the year, including a tweet saying she wanted to “kill every motherf---ing Zionist.” In the Dec. 1 letter addressed to USC President Carol Folt, Provost Charles Zukoski and board of trustees chair Rick Caruso — the latest in a series of letters from several of the same signatories — the faculty asked officials to rebuke Yasmeen Mashayekh, a 21-year-old civil engineering student, and “to distance USC from her hateful statements.” “The silence of our leadership on this matter is alienating, hurtful, and depressing,” the letter read. “It amounts to tacit acceptance of a toxic atmosphere of hatred and hostility.” On Dec. 3, Folt and Zukoski responded with a letter saying that the matter “has disturbed us deeply as we understand very well the hurtful impact of the statements on Twitter that you quoted, not only to those who are Jewish but also to those of us who know how harmful antisemitism is when left unchecked.” The university leaders said that over the summer, when the university first learned about the tweets, which have since been taken down, they removed Mashayekh from her paid mentoring position in the Viterbi School of Engineering. Screenshots of the deleted tweets were republished just before Thanksgiving by ""outside organizations"" that encouraged people to write to school officials about Mashayekh, who serves as a diversity, equity and inclusion senator for the Viterbi Graduate Student Assn. Folt and Zukoski noted that it would violate state law “for the university to remove anyone from a student-elected position based on protected speech."" Officials said the university has taken steps to “deepen our understanding of manifestations of antisemitism on campus” and has an initiative that works on empowering young people to recognize and counter hate in their communities. But the administration’s response hasn't satisfied many of the faculty members who signed the letter, or Mashayekh and her supporters. “I don’t feel safe on campus,” Mashayekh, who is Palestinian, said in an interview, noting that she has received several death threats, which intensified again recently after her image and deleted tweets were reposted by groups that compile dossiers of students and academics they consider to be anti-Israel. Mashayekh's supporters are circulating a letter urging university officials to make a statement “that demonstrates support for a student who is currently being disproportionately singled out.” For USC chemistry professor Curt Wittig, who signed the open letter, it's critical to think about the current situation within a broader historical context. We are living in troubling and politically explosive times, Wittig said, and if some major upheaval happens, history suggests that people will look for scapegoats. “Jews were the main target of that scapegoating in the first half of the 20th century,” Wittig said, noting that there has been a recent spike in hate crimes, including many antisemitic hate crimes. Colleagues have heard directly from some Jewish students who told them they were deeply frightened by the tweets, Wittig said, adding that he thought the university’s response earlier in the month read like “a deflection memo.” It fell far short, Wittig said, of the unambiguous moral stand he thought was warranted in response to the highly offensive tweets. “We expect something a little more forceful,"" he said. Judith Hirsch, a professor of biological sciences, agreed. “If a Jewish student had written the same tweets about Palestinians,"" she said, ""we would be equally distressed."" Mashayekh, who is finishing up her undergraduate civil engineering degree but also has started taking courses toward a graduate degree, said she informed the school of the targeted harassment she has been facing for several months and hasn’t been satisfied with its response. In addition to losing her paid mentoring position, she said, her name was recently removed from the Viterbi Graduate Student Assn. website, where her role as a diversity, equity and inclusion senator involves planning events such as dinners and movie nights. Mashayekh said she worries that she won’t be able to find a job in the future or pay off her loans. Mashayekh recently tweeted that her goal is “to normalize the language of resistance regardless of what that looks like.” Asked if, in retrospect, she would have done anything differently, she said, “Obviously, I didn’t expect any of this,” adding that she sent the tweets earlier in the year from an anonymous account, which was eventually tied back to her. “I just really wish I didn’t have to think about what I would change,” she said. “I wish people didn’t expect Palestinians to be the perfect victims.” This is the third such incident to roil the troubled campus since August 2020 involving Middle East politics and free speech, as well as accusations of racism and antisemitism. Faculty members, student groups, alumni, outside activists and others have entered the fray and taken sides in the tangle of controversies. In an interview, Zukoski, the university's provost, said he was limited in what he could say specifically about the case because of privacy issues but said there was no retribution involved in removing the student from the paid mentoring position, adding that she was offered other opportunities on campus. Zukoski said the current situation has been difficult for university officials to navigate; not only does it involve an intractable geopolitical conflict, he said, but it touches on the reality that much of hate speech is legally protected. And then there’s the added layer that much of this is playing out online. “How to handle social media and the amplifier it gives topics,” he said, “is a national issue that we’re all grappling with.” This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",U.S./LA Times,'Toxic atmosphere of hatred.'

12/15/2021,"Investigators have identified a man whose skeletal remains were found nearly 40 years ago in Twinsburg. And who he is might surprise you. His name is Frank “Frankie” Little Jr. and he was a songwriter and guitarist for The O’Jays in the 1960s. The R&B group started in Canton and made it into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Investigators discovered Little’s identity with the help of DNA and genealogical research. The breakthrough followed years of failed attempts that included the state crime lab making a clay model of the man’s skull. More: Authorities need public's help in identifying remains found in Twinsburg “I’m very excited we were able to put a name to these remains and to get him back to his family and give his family that piece of closure,” said Summit County Medical Examiner Lisa Kohler, who assisted Twinsburg detectives with the investigation. The family was also pleased to learn — after all these years — what happened to Little. ""It's amazing,"" said Margaret O'Sullivan, Little's cousin, who lives in Cleveland. ""We're glad that we have closure now. We know he's deceased."" The next step will be trying to figure out who killed Little and how his remains ended up in a garbage bag behind a Twinsburg business in February 1982. Kohler said his death, originally deemed “undetermined,” will be ruled a homicide. Little, who would be 78 if he was still alive, was born in Cleveland in 1943. He was with the O’Jays in the mid-60s, writing several songs, including “Do the Jerk” and “Oh, How You Hurt Me.” The band is best known for its hits that include “Love Train.” Little served in the U.S. Army for two years, including in the Vietnam War. He was last known to live in the area of East 105th Street and Superior Avenue in Cleveland and it is believed he was alive into at least the mid-1970s. Not much is known about his disappearance. Employees of a now-closed machine shop on Cannon Road in Twinsburg found a skull in February 1982 when they were dumping shavings in the woods. They weren’t sure what they’d found. “When they saw the skull, they didn’t believe it was human,” Twinsburg detective Eric Hendershott said. “They showed it around.” The employees alerted police and a search of the property turned up a garbage bag with more remains. The remains, which weren’t a complete set, were determined to be those of a Black male, 20 to 35 years old, about 5-foot, 6-inches tall who may have had adolescent kyphosis, which is a curvature of the spine. A forensic anthropologist estimated the remains had been there between two and four years. The remains had nothing with them that would help police identify the man. “There wasn’t even clothing – just bones in a garbage bag,” Hendershott said. Detectives issued a press release and appealed to the public and other local law enforcement agencies for assistance. They ruled out a few leads and the case went cold for more than 20 years. Sgt. Greg Feketik reopened the case in 2009, researching the idea of using DNA to determine the man’s identity. The man’s DNA was put into the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), the FBI’s DNA database, but this produced no hits. A Kent State professor made a sketch of the skull to show what the man looked like. In 2016, Samantha Molnar, a forensic artist with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI), made a clay model of the skull. More: Forensic artist puts face to unidentified remains In October 2018, Akron detectives reached out to Twinsburg, wondering if the remains might belong to a missing person from Akron. That tip didn’t pan out, but it lit a fire in Hendershott to make another attempt to identify the remains. “It occurred to me that time’s ticking,” he said. “Soon enough, people won’t be alive to remember him.” Hendershott knew that Joseph DeAngelo, the Golden State Killer, had been identified through DNA and the use of genealogical databases and another case in Eastlake had been solved this way. He wondered if the same technique could be used for Twinburg’s oldest unsolved case. “I was hopeful,” he said. “I was never certain or confident.” Hendershott reached out to the DNA Doe Project in September 2019 to help with the effort. The nonprofit group uses genetic genealogy to help identify John Does and Jane Does nationwide. Elias Chan and other volunteers with the Doe Project compared the DNA profile of the remains with profiles in GedMatch and Family Tree DNA, two public genealogy databases. From there, they began to build family trees to try to find potential family members of the man. The researchers zeroed in on the name Little and provided several names to Hendershott. Hendershott called O'Sullivan and found out that she had a cousin, Frank Little, who had disappeared. She didn’t know much about him but said he had a brother who lived in Georgia. ""We were wondering what happened to him,"" O'Sullivan said. Hendershott reached the brother and obtained a DNA sample from him. The sample was analyzed by BCI researchers and Kohler, who confirmed Little’s identity. Chan, who has worked on about 25 cases involving missing persons, with identifications made in 10 of them, was pleased Little was identified. “It’s very exciting, especially for these long cases,” Chan said. Chan said people can help solve missing person’s cases by entering their DNA into one of the public databases, especially if they have someone in their family who disappeared. “That will help bring your loved one home faster,” Chan said. Now that they’ve identified Little, investigators hope to find his killer. Little had a daughter who died in 2012 and a son who is thought to still be alive and living in the Cleveland area. Hendershott is hoping to track down the son to see if he might have more information about what have happened to his father. He said Little’s brother didn’t stay in contact with his nephew or even know his full name. The detective said Little’s brother recalled the last conversation he had with Little but not much else. Hendershott said he confirmed with Walter Williams, one of the still-living members of the O’Jays, that Little was a guitarist and songwriter with the band. He said Williams told him that Little wrote songs with Eddie Levert, another original band member. O'Sullivan, 79, said she went to see Little perform in Cleveland once but didn't realize he was with the O'Jay's until much later. ""To me, all rock-and-roll sounds good,"" said O'Sullivan, who was about 16 when she saw the band. O'Sullivan said she isn't sure when the family lost touch with Little. Hendershott said many questions remain about Little. “Part of the mystery is over with, but we have no idea how he got there, how he disappeared or where he lived toward the end of his life,” the detective said. Kohler said she plans to rule Little’s death a homicide, based on blunt-force injuries identified by the forensic anthropologist and the attempt to conceal his remains. She said she will finish Little’s death certificate once his family members choose a funeral home and make arrangements. As for determining who killed Little, Kohler said, that will fall to the detectives. She said her office will be happy to help when called upon. “Detectives will have to look at what they’ve got and decide if there’s anything more they can pursue,” she said.

12/15/2021,"Two key organizers of the main Jan. 6 rally in Washington, D.C. are coming in from the cold. Dustin Stockton and Jennifer Lynn Lawrence are set to testify next week before the House select committee investigating the attack on the U.S. Capitol. The pair will deliver testimony and turn over documents, including text messages, that indicate the extensive involvement members of Congress and the Trump administration had in planning the House challenge to certifying Biden’s election and rally near the White House where Donald Trump spoke — efforts that ultimately contributed to a massive and violent attack on the Capitol. More from Rolling Stone Fox News Hosts, Don Jr. Pleaded With Mark Meadows to Get Trump to Call Off Insurrection: Jan. 6 Committee Paul Gosar Takes Credit for Covid Funding He Bashed as a 'Democrat Spending Bonanza' Trump Blames Netanyahu, Not Himself, for Failed Israel-Palestine Peace Deal Among the documents the couple is providing are conversations they had with staffers and members of Congress as they planned the main rally that took place on the White House Ellipse that day. Stockton described these discussions as largely logistical and focused on planning the members’ participation in objections to the electoral certification on the House floor and various events that were staged to protest against the election. They include Instagram messages Lawrence exchanged with Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) as she tried to get him to speak at the Ellipse rally. Cawthorn, whose office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, ultimately appeared onstage at that event. “We’re turning it all over and we’ll let the cards fall where they may,” Stockton says. It’s the latest revelation from the couple, veteran activists who have spent the better part of a decade specializing in staging political stunts while working for conservative activist groups, Republican campaigns, and Trump’s on-again-off-again strategist Steve Bannon. Stockton and Lawrence were members of the team that led the nationwide “March for Trump” bus tour, which ended with the Jan. 6 rally at the White House Ellipse. In recent weeks, Stockton and Lawrence have participated in an extensive series of interviews with Rolling Stone revealing what they knew about the day. The pair were the sources for a story that was published in late October, when they said members of Congress were involved in planning Trump’s efforts to overturn the election and the Jan. 6 Ellipse rally. They claimed one of these lawmakers, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), suggested the possibility Trump could get them a “blanket pardon” in an unrelated ongoing investigation if they helped protest the election. (Gosar later suggested that story was “categorically false and defamatory.”) Stockton and Lawrence also say they were told that Trump’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, had communicated with the organizers and was warned about concerns of potential violence. Nothing in the documents viewed by Rolling Stone or the couple’s statements revealed any planning for, or coordination with, the violent attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters. Stockton and Lawrence spoke to Rolling Stone on the condition of anonymity for that story due to the ongoing investigation. Now, after receiving a subpoena from the committee, they decided to come forward and testify publicly — in Congress and in the press. The couple say they believe the public deserve answers about what went down on Jan. 6. “The people and the history books deserve a real account of what happened,” Stockton explains. Lawrence puts it more bluntly: “Violent shit happened,” she says. “We want to get to the bottom of that.” Behind those noble sentiments about why they’re cooperating with the committee is a hard reality: Stockton and Lawrence are running out of options. On Nov. 22, the committee subpoenaed the pair, demanding they deliver depositions and turn over documents related to their involvement in the rally and communications with members of Trump’s team. Stockton is scheduled to testify on Tuesday, and Lawrence is due up the following day. The duo are keenly aware that Bannon, Meadows, and others who have declined to cooperate with the committee are facing federal charges for contempt of Congress. “We’ve seen what’s happened with Bannon, and we don’t have the resources that a Steve Bannon has,” Stockton says, referencing Bannon’s multimillion dollar fortune. “Our options are, in a lot of ways, limited.” Stockton and Lawrence have spent the past few weeks on the move, switching between their R.V. and various hotels and hideouts. Apart from Louis, a greyhound-beagle mix who has accompanied them back and forth across the country, the couple have few of their old friends left. The legal drama and infighting have left them cut off from political work; Stockton is keeping them afloat with what he describes as “a variety of side hustles.” Being caught between those on the right they think might want to silence them and a Democrat-led committee that’s hit them with subpoenas and potentially large legal bills has left them with what Stockton labels “a sense of paranoia.” The couple have packed their things up and switched locations in the middle of the night at least once when they became suspicious of a group of “paramilitary-looking” young men. When they first made contact with the committee, the meeting, they say, was a disaster that left them with real questions about who they could trust. They’ve spent most of the past few months on the run. It’s been a long, stressful time for Stockton and Lawrence, a pair who were once rising stars in the extended MAGA universe and now find themselves looking constantly over their shoulders. For a lot of people who end up in such a tight spot, it’s tough to look back and pinpoint the moment things started to go wrong. For these two, that question has a fairly straightforward answer. In Lawrence’s mind, it all began when she had “a gun put to my head.” Zack Wittman for Rolling Stone IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS of Aug. 20, 2020, Stockton and Lawrence were asleep in their R.V. as it sat parked on the dusty backlot of the Casablanca Resort and Casino in Mesquite, Nevada. But some time after 4 a.m., the pair say they suddenly awoke after a late night to hear banging on the door. Their mobile home was surrounded by heavily armed officers from the United States Postal Inspection Service, an obscure law-enforcement arm of the Postal Service. Stockton leapt up and reached for his own firearm. He put the gun down when he saw a badge tapping on the window. “As I’m reaching down, one of the officers … the USPS special forces motherfuckers, he gets my attention. Thank god.… He gets my attention before I draw. There’s a good chance that probably saved my life,” Stockton says. “It’s clear that there’s enough men and firepower out there that, like, this is the real deal.” Stockton says he was handcuffed as the officers searched the R.V., while Lawrence, by her own admission, went “apeshit” and began shouting at the officers about corrupt courts and accusing them of being part of a plot to boost Trump’s Democratic rival Joe Biden. In fact, the raid was part of a fraud investigation into a group that Stockton and Lawrence worked on alongside Bannon. The pair — who first bonded while smoking a joint at the Republican National Convention in 2012 — had been working for Bannon since 2014, when he was running the conservative website Breitbart. They reported directly to Bannon and honed their skills making mischief and headlines on “special projects” for his site. During the 2016 election, they tried to chip away at Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, with a series of rogue operations that included recruiting Black activists to discourage the community from voting and embedding with Bernie Sanders supporters to help spur their protests at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. A recent profile in Politico that chronicled their work dubbed the pair “The Bonnie and Clyde of MAGA World.” The pair’s activism is infused with a mischievous sense of showmanship. Lawrence is a brash New Yorker who tends to wear skimpy outfits and gowns accessorized with her trademark winged eyeliner. Stockton is a former competitive poker player with tattooed arms, a thick beard, and a desert-fried drawl that belies his Nevada roots. On the “March for Trump” bus tour he favored a velour blazer and a pair of exotic stingray boots. After a brief falling out in 2017, Stockton and Lawrence reunited with a post-White House Bannon in 2019 to work together on “We Build the Wall,” an organization that was dedicated to raising private funds to help Trump erect his trademark wall along the southern border. The group’s fundraising ended up succeeding beyond their wildest imagination, raising about $25 million, enough to craft over three miles of barriers on the border. A little over a year later, Bannon and three other individuals affiliated with We Build the Wall were charged with fraud for allegedly taking “hundreds of thousands of dollars in donor funds” after vowing they would not accept payment for work on the project. Bannon did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Bannon, who was arrested on board a yacht, was pardoned by Trump in the final 24 hours of his presidency earlier this year. The other group leaders who were indicted did not receive pardons. Despite the raid, Stockton and Lawrence have never been charged. Their brush with the law has haunted them during their dealings with the January 6 committee. “It’s still hanging over our heads,” Stockton explains. “We definitely didn’t want to face another violent raid and we also wanted to avoid racking up even more legal fees and trouble.” Stockton and Lawrence took the armed raid on their R.V. as confirmation of their worst worries about “deep state” forces waging “lawfare” on Trump supporters. And they felt something similar happened on election night in 2020, when Stockton says the vote result reflected what he saw as “obvious shenanigans.” Stockton felt validated as Trump questioned the election results, even as a series of election experts and nonpartisan observers said the president’s claims of fraud were baseless conspiracy theories. And as the media universally — and quickly — reported that officials at every level of government found no evidence of election fraud, it reinforced he and Lawrence’s view that the fix was in. When social media and tech companies deleted content that spread election misinformation, Stockton and Lawrence saw it as dissent being silenced. The pair were convinced the election was stolen. According to the couple, Amy Kremer, a conservative activist who Stockton knew from his days in the Tea Party world, reached out to them on election night to see if they were interested in staging protests questioning Trump’s loss. They went all in for the cause. Stockton and Lawrence say they subsequently worked with Kremer to plan a rally in Washington on Nov. 14, 2020. That event featured a drive-by from Trump in the presidential motorcade. That night, there were clashes between Trump supporters and counterprotesters. Turnout among the pro-Trump contingent was high enough that Kremer was inspired to launch a nationwide “March for Trump” bus tour with Stockton and Lawrence. They were also, they say, encouraged by a suggestion that participating in the protests challenging Trump’s election loss could win them Trump’s help with the fallout from the We Build the Wall debacle. In December 2020, as the tour rolled around the country, Stockton and Lawrence say they got a call from Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) and his chief of staff, Thomas Van Flein. According to Stockton, Van Flein claimed he and the congressman had just met with Trump, who was considering giving them a “blanket pardon” to address the “We Build the Wall” investigation. “We were just in the Oval Office speaking about pardons and your names came up,” Van Flein allegedly said. Van Flein did not respond to a request for comment. Gosar suggested the bus tour was helping Stockton and Lawrence build support for a pardon from the caucus and Trump. “Keep up the good work,” Gosar said, according to Stockton. “Everybody’s seen what you’re doing.” While Stockton says Gosar previously supported the wall project and would likely have “moved to get the pardon regardless of what was happening post-election,” the call made clear to him that the protests against the 2020 vote could help get Trump on their side. “Trump was taking interest because of the notoriety of what we were currently doing,” Stockton says. Gosar did not respond to a request for comment. Through an attorney, Gosar in November said Stockton’s claims about the pardon were“frankly outrageous.” In an earlier bulletin from his office, Gosar called the story “100% false and made up.” Though Stockton and Lawrence were not identified in that article, Gosar — who admitted writing a letter in support of a pardon for Bannon — insisted the allegations came from “people I have never met.” He had, in fact, met Stockton and Lawrence. The trio were photographed beaming together at the Ellipse rally on Jan. 6. Courtesy of Dustin Stockton and Jennifer Lawrence Ultimately, the pardon for Stockton and Lawrence never materialized. Instead, it went to the man who, per Stockton, needed it less than the others. “Steve Bannon, the one guy in the group of us who has personal wealth and media and political connections beyond all of the rest of us, he’s the guy who gets the pardon,” Stockton says, his voice tinged with anger and disbelief. It was the start of a pattern they’d see again. THE JAN. 6 ELLIPSE RALLY was set to be the culmination of the bus tour, featuring a speech from multiple members of Congress and Trump himself. According to Stockton and Lawrence, it was planned to support the objections to electoral certification that were taking place that day on the House floor. They expected Trump and other leaders to present definitive detailed proof of election fraud as the crowd remained on the Ellipse, where security procedures were in place. Instead, for well over an hour, Trump aired a series of vague, misleading, and demonstrably false claims about the vote being “rigged” along with his familiar campaign grievances about the media supposedly ignoring his crowd sizes, the “radical left,” and “cancel culture.” Then, in the final 120 words of his speech, Trump declared, “We’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue … and we’re going to the Capitol.” Many in the crowd got on the move as Trump concluded, and the barricades at the Capitol complex were first breached shortly before his remarks wrapped. Fighting at the building between police and the former president’s supporters would rage for hours, even turning deadly. Stockton claims he was so upset by the speech that he turned to Lawrence and said, “Let’s get the fuck out of here.” He was incensed by both Trump’s call to march and the lack of concrete evidence that was presented onstage. “We assumed that him sitting with all the access to all the agencies of government and classified information he … had access to vastly more information than we did,” Stockton says. “We trusted when he told us that it was black-and-white and that there was clear evidence over, and over, and over again. We trusted that it would be there, and it ended up being a bluff, and he finally got caught in it.” The couple claim they then went back to their room at the Willard InterContinental, a luxury hotel adjacent to the Ellipse where many of the rally organizers stayed. Exhausted and frustrated, Stockton says he passed out almost immediately. At their hotel on Jan. 6, Lawrence says she watched the violence break out on TV as Stockton slept in the other room. She was incensed that Trump — who didn’t send out a tweet urging the crowd to “stay peaceful” until about an hour after the barricades were breached — hadn’t done more to call for an end to the violence. “As this was unfolding on the television, I was asking, ‘Where is Trump? Why hasn’t he come out and made a statement?’ It was way too long before he came out and made a statement,” Lawrence says. “Like, why are we waiting? This is so opposite of what we represent. You should want to denounce this immediately.” In their telling, the pair had been warning about the potential for violence since the first days after the election. “We had been, like, since November … trying to raise the red flag that, hey, like, not everybody on our side has the same outlook of, like, what this should look like,” Lawrence says. Both claimed they were among a group that had concerns about an event dubbed the “Wild Protest” organized by far-right activist Ali Alexander that was staged outside the building as the vote was being certified. According to Stockton and Lawrence, that wariness was due to Alexander’s links to militant groups and the potential consequences of bringing people who were “angry” about the election to the Capitol steps as the certification was taking place. Stockton and Lawrence say Kremer said she brought these concerns to Trump’s White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows. They were under the impression Meadows would resolve the issue. A spokesman for Meadows declined to comment. Ultimately, Alexander’s rally was granted a permit. In an interview for a television series hosted by Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, Alexander claimed he and Infowars host Alex Jones were contacted by the Trump campaign during Trump’s speech and told to lead crowds from the Ellipse to the Capitol. Alexander, who has an extensive history of ties to white nationalists and conspiracy theorists, has repeatedly insisted he played no role in the violence. Kremer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Alexander denied any responsibility for the Jan. 6 violence and accused Stockton and Lawrence of lying to the press. Once he woke up on Jan. 6, Stockton says he wanted the Ellipse rally organizers to denounce the attack as forcefully as possible. Kremer’s Women for America First group, which had obtained the permit for the Ellipse event, did issue a statement declaring they were “saddened and disappointed at the violence that erupted on Capitol Hill. But Stockton says he “wanted literally to do every interview.” “They put a statement together that denounced it, but I wanted to go nuclear. Like, I wanted to go full-court press with it,” Stockton claims. “We were pushing hard and put a plan together to hold a press conference … to fully denounce and take all questions from everybody.” To Stockton, it was important for the Ellipse rally planners to distance themselves from the violence. However, Kremer ultimately decided the statement was sufficient. Rolling Stone reported in November that Kremer and some of her fellow organizers spent the evening of Jan. 6 — as the attempted insurrection was winding down — in a suite at the Willard, dining on charcuterie. Stockton says he pushed for the group to more forcefully denounce the violence but was overruled. “We didn’t have anything to do with it. It wasn’t us, and frankly we are going to be tarnished with this forever unless we get out and scream from the rooftops that this wasn’t right,” Stockton says he argued. “Unfortunately, I lost that battle.” Almost a year later, they are, as Stockton might put it “going nuclear.” They’re cooperating with the committee and willing to do any interview they can to tell their story to the press. But when they initially tried to come to the investigators, things got off to a rocky start. Zack Wittman for Rolling Stone STOCKTON AND LAWRENCE WERE headed into what they thought was a confidential meeting with select committee staffers on Oct. 25 when they got an email from a team of reporters. Politico was about to publish an article noting the pair were cooperating with the House select committee on the January 6 attack. Stockton immediately screen-shot the journalists’ query and forwarded it along to the committee’s investigators. He provided Rolling Stone with a copy of that message. “This puts us in a very dangerous position,” Stockton wrote to the committee staff. The couple still joined the scheduled videoconference, but the conversation was a short one: “It was like, what the hell is this?” Stockton recounted. “We were so upset with the committee.… The call ended up lasting like maybe two total minutes.” Rolling Stone has confirmed the meeting was set to take place and that Stockton and Lawrence were told it would be confidential. An attorney familiar with the investigation said they were aware of a separate instance where a potential cooperating witness similarly had their name leaked to the press ahead of a meeting with the committee. (A spokesperson for the committee declined to comment on Stockton’s account.) Stockton and Lawrence believed they had good reason to fear word getting out about their cooperation with the committee. “These were violent acts. And to put someone’s name out there … it puts a huge target on them,” Lawrence said in a recent interview. “They swore up and down that this was going to be completely off-record.” The press coverage of their meeting with the committee caused the couple to bug out. Stockton and Lawrence quickly ditched the R.V. in Nevada that had been their home for the better part of a year and headed to an undisclosed location in Florida. While there, they met up with Rolling Stone. The pair first began talking to the magazine prior to their scheduled meeting because they say they feared the committee would be “a political circus that only targets their opposition.” “It’s important to us that, not even just the committee, that the political actors on both sides — that includes Trump — that they don’t get to whitewash and cherry-pick what parts of the story are told,” Stockton says. Even before word of their supposedly off-record meeting leaked, Stockton and Lawrence were apprehensive about dealing with the congressional investigation. They had history with some of its members. After GOP leadership blocked a proposal for a bipartisan commission to investigate the attack, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tapped six Democrats and two Republicans who have been critical of Trump to serve on the committee. One of the Democrats, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), was a manager during Trump’s second impeachment trial earlier this year. During that case, the Democrats presented an image of one of Lawrence’s tweets, and she subsequently filed a defamation suit against a company that had worked with the Democrats, arguing her words were mischaracterized and an image of the tweet was altered. Raskin did not respond to a request for comment. And Stockton and Lawrence claim one of the committee Republicans, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), had a relationship with Kremer. In February 2019, Kremer’s Women for America First group held a border-security event outside the Capitol. Cheney spoke at that conference, and Kremer described her as the event’s host. “March for Trump” group text messages that were reviewed by Rolling Stone show that Kremer claimed Cheney’s office helped her with another Women for America First event that was held in October 2019 at the Capitol to protest Trump’s first impeachment. “Liz Cheney’s office is securing the permit at the Capitol for us,” Kremer wrote of the “Stop Impeachment Now!” rally. In an eerie foreshadowing of Jan. 6, that event ended with Trump supporters marching into the Capitol, staging sit-ins in the offices of multiple Democrats, and hounding members of Congress in the halls. “To see Liz Cheney … not even have to put a disclaimer somewhere like, ‘I have a prior relationship with Amy Kremer who is being investigated.’ It’s one of the things that just made me question, like, what is really going on here,” Lawrence says. Cheney voted against Trump’s first impeachment in 2019, but she became known as one of the former president’s biggest critics within the Republican Party when she supported his second impeachment in the wake of Jan. 6. A spokesperson for Cheney did not respond to a request for comment. As a result of their misgivings, Stockton and Lawrence considered trying to stonewall the committee, following the route of other Trump allies who have pleaded the Fifth. However, Lawrence said a past comment from Trump himself kept ringing in her head. In 2016, when he was on the campaign trail, Trump blasted former staff members for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, who invoked their constitutional right against self-incrimination during the House select committee investigation into the Benghazi attack. “If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment,” Trump asked. In the end, Lawrence agreed with him. “I feel like with everyone pleading the Fifth, we’re not getting down to the sole issue that violence did occur, somebody caused it, and we need to get to the bottom of it so that it doesn’t happen again,” Lawrence says, adding, “And to Trump’s point, innocent people don’t plead the Fifth.” THE CHAOS OF JAN. 6 and the attack on the bedrock American principle of the peaceful transfer of power has raised uncomfortable questions about innocence, accountability, and reconciliation. Hundreds of people have been arrested by the FBI for storming the Capitol and are now working their way through a legal system that, in some cases, has not been particularly forgiving. But many of those people say they sincerely believe the election was stolen. They were sold that lie and called to protest by a group that included members of Congress and the then-president of the United States. So far, the most powerful players behind the Jan. 6 attack have served exactly zero days in jail. It’s a situation that Stockton and Lawrence find deeply troubling. And it is Trump himself that the pair believe was, as Stockton says, responsible “as much as anybody who actually was doing the violence.” A spokesperson for the former president did not respond to a request for comment. “Ultimately, the people who were committing the acts are most responsible. However, this was completely foreseeable and predictable,” Stockton says. “He knew better than to send people down there under those circumstances with those people at the front of it.” Their narrative about Jan. 6 certainly casts them in a favorable light. But parts of that narrative have been corroborated elsewhere. During an FBI investigation that is the largest in the bureau’s history, no evidence has been released that Stockton or Lawrence joined the crowds who stormed the Capitol. Nor has any such evidence emerged from an online sleuthing effort that’s also nearly unprecedented. And other claims from Stockton and Lawrence have been backed up elsewhere. There have been reports that Trump’s call to march on the Capitol was ad-libbed. The committee has indicated it has evidence showing Meadows was in direct contact with Ellipse rally planners. And text messages from the organizers obtained by Rolling Stone show Stockton pressing for a more robust denunciation of the violence in its immediate aftermath, while Kremer declared on the morning after, “I don’t think it is wise for us to talk to the press or have a press conference.” Those text messages also show the Ellipse-rally planners expressing some dismay about Alexander’s planned event. A separate source who was involved in staging the Ellipse rally also told Rolling Stone that Stockton and Lawrence were pushing Kremer for more public denunciation of the violence. What Stockton and Lawrence say they want now is a new chapter. Stockton describes himself as “exhausted” and eager to change paths, possibly working on activism that is aimed at helping people find “common ground.” “I hope going forward that we’ll find a way to step, maybe, back from the edge a little bit,” Stockton says. The pair do already have experience working across the aisle. In 2018, they helped students who survived the Parkland shooting that year and were pushing for gun-control legislation to obtain meetings with Republican lawmakers. Of course, Stockton and Lawrence’s yearning for transparency is coming as they are being targeted by a congressional select committee. The pair have spent much of their lives working as paid activists and organizers. It’s a world where money and attention are closely tied together. Going from rabble-rousers to aspiring peacemakers amid the spotlight of a congressional investigation could just be their latest move in a long history of playing politics. Their attempted self-rehabilitation is at odds with the reckless swashbuckling personas they developed during their years working with Bannon and on the bus tour ahead of the election. On that tour, both Stockon and Lawrence made statements that at least could be interpreted as promoting or threatening violence. “Right now we still have the power to fix” the election result, Stockton said at a stop in Savannah. “But if they allow the election to get stolen, we lose the power to do it. I mean there’s still ways to do it, but it gets a lot, lot uglier and a lot, lot worse. And I don’t think any of us want to go there.” Stockton later told BuzzFeed News the “ugly” option he referred to is state-by-state electoral reform. However, the couple doesn’t necessarily disavow the fiery rhetoric they deployed on the bus tour. Despite their issues with Trump and their anger over what played out on Jan. 6, Stockton and Lawrence say they still passionately believe in the former president’s “America First” agenda. They also continue to have doubts about the 2020 election. Due to the lack of evidence, Stockton no longer believes the number of votes was fraudulent, but the couple remain convinced that “Big Tech” censorship, biased media, and government “lawfare” combined to “fortify” the election for Trump’s opponent, Joe Biden. Lawrence says “hindsight’s 20/20” and concedes “obviously there’s some stuff that I would like to take back and stuff that I wish I hadn’t said.” But she is also adamant her words were not an encouragement to violence. Or, as she puts it, “I didn’t incite shit.” Stockton notes Democrats made their own attempts to object to Trump’s 2016 election win. The pair also point out that none of the events they worked on prior to Jan. 6 resulted in major violence. “I am a free-speech fundamentalist and I don’t believe that any of the political hyperbole or fiery speeches are responsible for what happened,” he said. “I’ve always done the best to walk things to the line with the rhetoric but match it to actions that are productive and safe.” Of course, Jan. 6 went way over the line. What consequences, if any, Lawrence and Stockton will face for their role in Jan. 6 is in the hands of the committee and the justice system. And what forgiveness they might find is up to the public, as they hope to make their case in a media blitz. But whether or not you believe their journey from firebrands to whistleblowers is genuine, Stockton and Lawrence’s tumultuous path sheds light on how the country reached this fraught, violent moment — and perhaps — how we might come back from the brink. For his most hardcore supporters, Trump had a unique pull. Breaking that personal bond may be the only way to get them to question the things they thought they knew. Trump fought the fights we wanted to fight.… He championed the things we thought had been ignored and cast aside.… We attributed stuff to him that he didn’t deserve,” Stockton explained. “It almost feels like it’s the same feeling you get after you get conned or scammed, where you initially don’t want to accept.” Even intense legal pressure wasn’t initially enough to get Stockton and Lawrence to question their leader. Following the raids on Stockton, Lawrence, and the other “We Build the Wall” group organizers, Trump’s White House press secretary made comments distancing the former president from the project, which had been promoted by members of his family. Stockton describes this as one of many instances where he “made excuses for Trump.” But Jan. 6 was different. Stockton says the attack and its aftermath was “finally the thing that broke that false reality we had created about who he was.” “At the end of the day, there is no excuse, and the words came out of his mouth. It was the call of the president of the United States,” Stockton says. Stockton and Lawrence occupy a unique space in the pro-Trump ecosystem. Their years of activism have brought them close to the former president’s inner circle, but they were never quite there. The couple operated somewhere between the upper echelons of the MAGA movement and the rank-and-file. Indeed, as first reported by Rolling Stone, wealthy Trump allies have set up a defense fund for campaign and White House aides who have been named in the investigation. But while their more well-connected colleagues have received legal help, Stockton and Lawrence have been left to fend for themselves. From this vantage point, it has been especially clear that Trump urged his supporters to rush to his aid, but he hasn’t necessarily stood by them amid the subsequent law-enforcement crackdown. While Stockton and Lawrence have reached out to family members of people who were imprisoned for charges related to Jan. 6 with offers of advice and contacts, they say no such support has come from Trump. “This guy’s sitting on giant gold buildings all over the world with his name on it, and we’ve done more to help those people than he has,” Stockton says of Trump. “It’s fucking disgusting.” It’s clear the tie between the former president and his faithful is incredibly resilient. As president, Trump — with his steady stream of tweets, and never-ending headlines — was a constant presence in his supporters’ lives. But since he’s left office and been exiled from social media, Trump has to do real work to maintain that connection. And time and again, Trump’s willingness to stick his neck out for his people — and his sway over them — has buckled under pressure. Trump has a long history of falling out with members of his team amid investigations and controversy that includes his former attorney Michael Cohen, a long list of fired White House officials, and, at times, Bannon. Given that record, it’s easy to doubt Stockton and Lawrence’s claim of being shocked by his behavior. However, the pair insist their experience with the aftermath of Jan. 6 opened their eyes. “Other people had warned us … people in his inner circle even,” Stockton said of Trump’s paper-thin loyalty. “It’s not like we didn’t see him cast people aside before selfishly, but we always kind of just said, ‘Oh, that’s just disgruntled former employees, right?’ You know, we bought the bullshit.” Best of Rolling Stone The Useful Idiots New Guide to the Most Stoned Moments of the 2020 Presidential Campaign Anatomy of a Fake News Scandal The Radical Crusade of Mike Pence",Politics/Rolling Stone,Two Jan. 6 Organizers Are Coming Forward and Naming Names: ‘We’re Turning It All Over’,https://news.yahoo.com/two-jan-6-organizers-coming-025927382.html
