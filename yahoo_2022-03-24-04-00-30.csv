3/24/2022,"Juice — a Ukrainian fighter pilot who only went by his call sign and wore his helmet and visor to protect his identity — appeared Mondayon Anderson Cooper 360 to speak about the fight for the skies above Ukraine. Juice, who was given the name by friends in the California Air National Guard, admitted that Russia can currently claim air superiority, but said Russian casualties are mounting. “Russians have a lot of loss — losses, and they have a fear of our air defense,” Juice said. “So they couldn’t fly here just comfortable for them.” Juice said he’s currently on standby, awaiting orders if a threat arises, and spoke of his current role in defending Ukraine. “I’m sitting just near [the] aircraft or just in the cockpit,” Juice said, “and my colleagues from the radar units, they’re just giving me the information about targets, and I’m taking off and intercepting these threats.” Though the U.S. is continuing to supply Ukraine with defense systems, it blocked the transfer of fighter jets from Poland that would have gone to Ukraine via a U.S. air base in Germany. Juice said they need more jets if they are to gain air superiority. “We need efficient ground air defense systems,” Juice said, “and we need some other fighter jets to gain the air superiority to fight effectively against these threats.” And Juice said that he and others are ready to continue their defense against Russia’s war of aggression. “All of us are ready to fight, just with our jets, with our guns, even just in the fields with rifles. So our people, including me, we are ready to fight Russians, and we are ready to defend our country, to defend our people in absolutely any ways. But we need tools, effective tools, to do this efficiently.” Anderson Cooper 360 airs weeknights at 8 p.m. on CNN.

3/24/2022,"VP Kamala Harris felt ""wounded"" and ""belittled"" by her Vogue cover image, a forthcoming book reports. A top adviser relayed Harris' displeasure directly to Vogue's editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. The controversial cover photo showed Harris casually dressed with a heavily draped background. Vice President Kamala Harris felt ""belittled"" and ""wounded"" by the cover photo of her that Vogue selected for its February 2021 issue and dispatched a top aide to complain to Anna Wintour, according to a forthcoming book. Politico's West Wing Playbook newsletter previewed excerpts of ""This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America's Future"" by New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns, set for release in May, that detail Harris' reaction to the controversial Vogue cover. The image, shot by photographer Tyler Mitchell, featured Harris casually dressed in a Donald Deal pantsuit and Converse sneakers in front of a background that featured draped green and pink fabrics in a nod to Harris' college sorority colors. But when the image leaked online in January 2021, it reportedly caught Harris' team off guard and garnered immediate criticism. Some of Harris' allies and other critics charged that both the choice of Harris dressed more casually failed to give her the respect and gravitas that she deserved, and that the lighting and background portrayed the vice president-elect in an unflattering light. ""Harris was wounded,"" the authors wrote. ""She felt belittled by the magazine, asking aides: Would Vogue depict another world leader this way?"" Harris' then-top spokeswoman Symone Sanders, now an MSNBC host, went directly to Wintour, Vogue's editorial director and editor-in-chief, to relay Harris' displeasure with the image, according to the book. Wintour, for her part, told Sanders that she'd selected the photo herself and thought it made Harris more ""relatable,"" the book said. ""The team at Vogue loved the images Tyler Mitchell shot and felt the more informal image captured Vice President-elect Harris's authentic, approachable nature — which we feel is one of the hallmarks of the Biden/Harris administration,"" a Vogue spokesperson also said in a public statement at the time. But amid the mounting criticism, the magazine picked a different image from Harris' Vogue shoot showing the vice president more formally dressed in a powder blue pantsuit with a simpler gold background as the cover photo for the digital issue and a special, limited edition print issue to commemorate the inauguration. The Vogue incident also exacerbated tensions between Harris' office and the West Wing, a major theme of the book.  When Harris' chief of staff Tina Flournoy caught wind of the uproar over the cover image, she raised the issue to an unnamed ""senior Biden campaign official,"" the book said. But, with the COVID-19 pandemic still raging and the nation still reeling over the January 6 insurrection, ""[t]he Biden adviser told Flournoy that this was not the time to be going to war with Vogue over a comparatively trivial aesthetic issue."" ""Tina, the adviser said, these are first-world problems,"" the authors recounted. A representative for Vogue did not return Insider's request for comment. In the excerpts of the book reviewed by Politico, the authors also reported that Harris felt disrespected by White House aides not standing when she walked into a room as they did for Biden. Flournoy took the issue up with senior White House adviser Anita Dunn. The authors reveal more details about Harris' dissatisfaction and frustrations with the portfolio of issues she was assigned to handle, which includes voting rights, immigration, and the US' relations with the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Harris, they wrote, was ""resigned to the assignment"" of the Northern Triangle nations and ""did not hesitate to chide Biden"" for portraying her as ""border czar.""

But TikToker @juliakcrist even shocked herself when she “exposed” her strange secret. The content creator revealed that she, in fact, enjoys sleeping in jeans. People were quick to clown her, but it was all in good fun. Watch this tiny bedroom get an organization overhaul in just one day: “There’s so much you don’t know about me,” her caption read. “I like to sleep in jeans.” She added, “[I] can’t believe I’m exposing myself like this.” “I thought I was the only one,” a person commented. “That’s like sociopathic tendencies. That is NOT OK. Lol,” another joked. “I don’t even enjoy wearing jeans during the day,” someone said. Experts tend to be on the side of the comment section here. Gynecologist Dr. Alyssa Dweck told Metro that not only is it best to avoid sleeping with pants on, but it’s preferable to avoid underwear altogether. Dr. Dweck told Metro that when the pubic area “is constantly covered, especially by a fabric that’s not moisture-wicking or absorbent, moisture collects, creating the perfect breeding ground for bacteria or yeast.” This can cause an increase in ingrown hairs and infections in pre-existing ingrown hairs while also making you more susceptible to thrush. For those who like to wear pants or underwear in bed, always opt for something loose-fitting. “If there’s ever a time to break out the granny panties, this would be it,” the doctor told Metro.

3/24/2022,"Durbin intervened after Graham kept interrupting Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. Graham asked Jackson what she thought about Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings. ""She's had nothing to do with the Kavanaugh hearings,"" Durbin told Graham. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin on Wednesday intervened in a back-and-forth between Sen. Lindsey Graham and Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson after the South Carolina Republican kept interrupting the judge as she answered questions during her third day of confirmation hearings. Graham asked Jackson for her positions on undocumented immigrants and voting, and pressed her on her sentencing record in child pornography cases during his 20 minutes of questioning. When his time was nearing its end, Graham repeatedly interrupted Jackson as she tried to answer his questions. The exchange came to a head when Graham pivoted to ask Jackson about Justice Brett Kavanaugh's 2018 Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Graham had exceeded his allotted questioning time, prompting Durbin, the top Democrat and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to interrupt him. ""Well please, Mr. Chairman,"" Graham responded. ""It's one minute and 47 seconds. She filibustered every question I had, and she has a right to give an answer. But I'm trying to make a point in 20 minutes."" Graham went on to detail the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh that took center stage in his confirmation battle before the Judiciary Committee, and singled out Democrats on the committee, accusing them of withholding the information until the hearing to blindside Kavanaugh. Democrats, with the exception of Judiciary Committee ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein, said they were caught off guard by the accusations against Kavanaugh, just as Republicans were. ""He was ambushed. How would you feel if we did that to you?"" Graham asked Jackson. Jackson, who previously mentioned that she had not watched the Kavanaugh hearings, told Graham that she appreciated the ""kindness"" that every senator had shown her during her confirmation process. Graham cut her off, noting that she's a ""very nice person,"" then continued to speak about the handling of Kavanaugh's confirmation. ""She's had nothing to do with the Kavanaugh hearings,"" Durbin told Graham. ""No, but I'm asking her about how she may feel about what y'all did,"" Graham responded forcefully, slamming his hand on the table. ""You won't even let her finish her response,"" Durbin interjected. The scuffle led Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, seated beside Durbin, to demand ""order"" in the hearing room. Durbin then notified Graham again that his time has expired and gave Jackson the opportunity to respond to his questions. ""Senator, I don't have any comment on what procedures took place in this body regarding Justice Kavanaugh,"" Jackson told Graham. The conversation shifted back to Jackson's record on child pornography cases. Several Republicans have claimed that Jackson, in her time as a federal district judge, was lenient with child pornography offenders because she imposed sentences shorter than those recommended by federal guidelines. Legal experts have debunked the accusations, saying that they leave out key context and data that Jackson's conduct was within the mainstream of federal judges and that the guidelines are overly severe and outdated. Some Republicans, including Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, have distanced themselves from their GOP colleagues' attacks on Jackson. Jackson, throughout her confirmation hearings this week, has repeatedly defended her record, denounced the child pornography crimes, and explained to Graham, along with other Republican senators, her job as a judge. ""Every person in all of these charts and documents, I sent to jail because I know how serious this crime is. Every person, I discussed the harm of these terrible, terrible images to the victims who are portrayed in them. I talked about what this crime does to the children who are being abused in these photos,"" Jackson said Wednesday. ""And on the other side of their terms of imprisonment, I ensured that they were facing lengthy periods of supervision and restrictions on their computer use so they could not do this sort of thing again. That's what Congress has required of judges and that's what I did in every case."" Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/Business Insider,Sen.

In a statement given via Merseyside Police, the family thanked the community for their support. They said: ""We would ask that we are now allowed some space and time to try and come to terms with the tragic loss of our much-loved Bella-Rae. ""She will be sadly missed but never forgotten.""

3/24/2022,"By Yuka Obayashi and Kantaro Komiya TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese turned off neon signs, dimmed their lights and dialled down thermostats on Tuesday after the government issued an urgent call to save energy to avoid blackouts after an earthquake last week caused a serious power shortage. Up to 3 million households faced the threat of blackouts on Tuesday night, as utility Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) warned of tight supply and surging demand as snow fell across Tokyo and the temperature dropped to 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 Fahrenheit). But by later in evening, the country appeared likely to avoid blackouts, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said. Still, authorities were keeping a power-supply warning in place for Wednesday, public broadcaster NHK said, meaning the world's no.3 economy could still face blackouts. A similar warning for the northeastern area was lifted, NHK said. A magnitude 7.4 earthquake last week off the northeastern coast - the same region devastated by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011 - temporarily cut power to about 2 million households, including hundreds of thousands in Tokyo. ""At this rate, we are coming closer to a state where we will have to conduct power outages similar to those that took place after the quake,"" the trade minister, Koichi Hagiuda, said earlier on Tuesday. The quake hit six thermal plants, knocking them out of operation in areas served by Tepco and Tohoku Electric Power Co, and the damage could leave some of them idle for weeks or even months, Hagiuda said. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno earlier called on residents in eastern Japan affected by the power crisis to do their part, including by lowering thermostats to around 20C (68F) and switching off unnecessary lights. Numerous users responded to the call. National broadcaster NHK dimmed its studio lights while electronics retailer Bic Camera turned off about half of the televisions at dozens of its stores. The 634-metre (693-yard) Tokyo Skytree tower turned off its lights for the whole day for the first time and operators of the city-centre Tokyo Tower lit up only its bottom half. 'RESTART NUCLEAR POWER' Retail giant Seven & I Holdings said 8,500 7-Eleven stores set their thermostats to 20C - one degree cooler than usual - while its Ito-Yokado supermarkets were dimming their lights by 10%. Nissan Motor said it was using an in-house power generator for 13 hours at its factory north of the capital. Many individual consumers also did their bit. ""I use the heater a lot so I will try to do my part to save energy,"" said college student Shuntaro Ishinabe, 22. Government spokesperson Matsuno said the request to save energy was unlikely to extend beyond Tuesday, given an expected rise in temperatures and the addition of more solar power generation as the weather improved. Japan has faced a tough energy market since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami crippled Tepco's Fukushima Daiichi plant, causing the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl and leading to the suspension of operations at most of Japan's nuclear reactors. With energy prices surging on tight global supply and the Ukraine crisis, Japan's biggest business lobby, Keidanren, has been calling for a swift restart of the nuclear plants. ""A sudden halt of energy causes a lot of problems, and I think (the general public) has really felt the importance of energy security given recent events,"" Keidanren Chairman Masakazu Tokura said. ""Given the larger trend to become carbon neutral and cut back on greenhouse gases, I believe there will be more difficulties unless we restart nuclear power plants swiftly.""

3/24/2022,"It took one look for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to put Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) firmly in his place. After answering questions for hours from the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, the Supreme Court nominee gave a withering look to Cruz when he sought to cast doubt on her membership on the board of a liberal private school that proudly promotes “social justice.” The conservative senator tried to paint fellow Harvard Law alum, Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson as a proponent of so-called critical race theory because Georgetown Day School had placed books including “How To Be an Anti-Racist” in its curriculum. Jackson, who would become the first Black woman to ever serve on the nation’s top court, took a long measured pause before answering. “Senator, I do not believe that any child should be made to think that any child is racist or less than,” Jackson said. The poised jurist looked incredulously over her glasses as Cruz claimed that another book was inappropriate for recommended summer reading because it suggested that America is not a color-blind society. “This book says the exact opposite of what Dr. King spoke about,” blustered Cruz. “Are you comfortable with these ideas being taught to children?” Jackson wasted little time shutting down his argument, which echoes GOP campaign complaints against white kids being taught about the history of racism. “Senator, I have not reviewed any of those books,” she said matter-of-factly. “They don’t come up in my work as a judge, which respectfully, I am here to address.” Cruz quickly backed down, returning to other lines of attack, like criticism that she gave sentences that were too lenient to sex offenders.",Politics/NY Daily News,Supreme Court Judge nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson shuts down Sen.

3/24/2022,"A 23-year-old woman visiting a Disney park alleged on TikTok that she was “dress coded” and asked to wear a replacement shirt. User @toragrams did not specify what theme park she was in but based on her TikTok bio identifying her as being Florida, outlets like Newsweek have suggested that it was at Walt Disney World in Orlando. According to the Disney World site, “Disney reserves the right to deny admission to or remove any person wearing attire that is considered inappropriate.” With just $1,000 and one day, this Harlem bedroom gets a brand new look: In terms of what constitutes “inappropriate,” the site adds, “clothing which, by nature, exposes portions of the skin that may be viewed as inappropriate for a family environment.” This isn’t the first time a woman has gone viral for claiming that an amusement park employee dubbed her outfit “inappropriate.” A year ago, a mom shared a whole saga on TikTok after a Six Flags employee allegedly asked her to leave the park over the length of her shorts, which went so viral Six Flags actually responded to it. It’s not just limited to amusement parks either — in June 2021, two 20-year-olds were asked to leave a bar because the manager said they were basically “topless,” and a few months later a woman was told to “wait outside” while getting her car fixed because she was wearing a crop top. In @toragrams’s case, she filmed herself wearing a black cropped cardigan that tied in the center. It was clear @toragrams was not wearing anything underneath the cardigan, and one commenter who claimed to have worked at Disney said that “the rule is that your top can’t have just a string to hold it together.” The TikToker didn’t seem to have any hard feelings about the incident and even captured the video, which now has almost 6 million views, with: “I mean, I kinda agree [with] them looking back at this video.” Protocol for being “dress coded” was for @toragrams to receive a voucher to go pick up a new shirt. While @toragrams mentioned that the shirt was free for her, other viewers debated in the comments whether that was always the case. Other commenters seemed confused about why, specifically, @toragrams’s shirt was questioned — considering that most of her upper body was covered by the cardigan. “Honestly that crop isn’t even bad. It’s just cute, what’s the problem?” one person asked. “I don’t see anything wrong with your outfit…??” another said. “It’s hot in Florida..?” But several people pointed out that the strings could come off on rides or, worse, get tangled on them and potentially injure someone. “I worked at Disney World, and even though it’s NOT a bad top … you reach over 80mph winds on coasters and rides,” someone pointed out.

3/24/2022,"The filmmaker Maxim Pozdorovkin said Donald Trump fit ""neatly"" into an anti-West Kremlin narrative. He said Trump was portrayed as the only US leader not ""trying to destroy the Russian way of life."" He described Russia as ""fully and artfully"" waging an information war for the past decade. A filmmaker who has extensively documented Russian propaganda said this week that of all the US leaders, former President Donald Trump fit ""neatly"" into the Kremlin's anti-West narrative. In an interview with The Washington Post, Maxim Pozdorovkin — whose award-winning documentary ""Our New President"" follows Trump's election in 2016 as depicted by Russia's state-linked media — gave his take on Moscow's long-standing propaganda campaign against the US and the West. Pozdorovkin told The Post that in the decade leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russians had been fed the same message ""over and over"" by President Vladimir Putin's government that the West was constantly attempting to ""stifle and destroy"" their society. He said Trump ""fits neatly"" in Moscow's propaganda efforts because he could be portrayed as the ""one American leader who wasn't trying to destroy the Russian way of life."" In the context of that narrative, Pozdorovkin said, the domestic backlash that Trump faced in the US — no matter the real reason — could be framed as being fueled by anti-Russia interests. ""It's been an information war — a totally one-sided information war — and it has been waged so fully and artfully that it's made a lot of what's happening now preemptively possible,"" he told the outlet. ""The Russian media has been totally shadowboxing for years; no one was fighting back,"" he said later in the interview. ""But that doesn't really matter. If you ingrain this message of victimhood so completely, what it does is when there's any kind of Putin aggressive action, as there is now, a lot of people in Russia don't see it as aggressive. ""They just see it as standing up for their way of life."" Trump and Putin met five times during Trump's presidency, though details of these meetings were handled secretively, as The New York Times reported in 2019. Trump's dealings with Russia and apparent openness toward Russian help during his 2016 presidential campaign attracted wide scrutiny during much of his presidency. Amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Trump has made several statements about Putin and Russia. Most recently, Trump said if he were still president, he would send nuclear submarines to go ""up and down"" Russia's coast to pressure Putin. He has also suggested in a speech to Republican donors that the US put Chinese flags on its fighter jets to ""bomb the shit out of Russia."" Soon before the invasion, Trump praised Putin's justification for sending his forces into Ukraine, calling the Russian leader ""savvy,"" ""smart,"" and a ""genius.""

3/24/2022,"There are some videos on the internet that leave you speechless. This one, filmed in central Texas Monday, is one of those videos. It shows what looks to be a red first-generation Chevy Silverado pickup truck being tossed around by a tornado and dragged across the ground, with at least one person inside. But that's not the crazy part. After the tornado moves on and the truck is thrown back upright... the truck simply drives away like nothing happened. This happened on a four-lane highway in Elgin, Texas, according to Brian Emfinger, a storm chaser who published the video to Twitter and YouTube on Tuesday. The Chevy is caught in the tornado and subjected to the full force of its winds, causing the vehicle to roll onto its driver side. It does a 360-degree spin while sitting perpendicular to the road before being pushed back upright by the tornado's gusts. Despite what must've been the scariest moment of their life occurring, the driver has no trouble continuing down the road. From what we can tell, the truck looked to be relatively unharmed after the event, save for some sizable scratches on the driver's side body panels and a missing side mirror. It's unclear at this time how many occupants were in the truck, or if anyone inside sustained any injuries. Tornados have been ripping through the Austin area since Monday. At least one person has been killed in the storm, and heavy damage has also been done to residences in its path, the Weather Channel reports.

Greene’s claim that lawmakers like her are “not the fringe” but “the base of the party” is put on loop in the edited, online spot that the PAC MeidasTouch released Tuesday. The conspiracy theorist’s comments are cut alongside footage of her parroting Kremlin talking points about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “thug” and former President Donald Trump hailing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression toward his neighboring country as “genius.” The video, below, garnered more than 340,000 views in its first 10 hours on Twitter alone. The clip went viral as Greene faced backlash for blaming Ukraine for being invaded by Russia. “You see Ukraine kept just poking the bear and poking the bear, which is Russia,” she told the Voice of Rural America Network. “Russia is being very successful in their invasion, even though we hear different things on television,” she added. Independent reports suggest Russia misjudged the strength of Ukrainian resistance and is incurring higher casualties than expected. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/24/2022,"Two parents have been charged with manslaughter after allegedly allowing their daughter to become morbidly obese. In what is believed to be the first case of its kind, the parents of Kaylea Titford, 16, appeared in court on Tuesday after being charged with gross negligence manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable person. The disabled teenage girl was found dead at her home in Newtown, Powys, Wales, in October 2020. It is alleged that between March 24 and Oct 11, 2020, Kaylea's father Alun Titford, 44, and mother Sarah Lloyd-Jones, 39, of Colwyn, Newtown, failed to ensure that her dietary needs were met, leading to morbid obesity. Nor did they ensure that she got enough exercise, was in a hygienic condition, had a safe and hygienic environment, that her physical health was maintained or that reasonable medical help was sought, the charge claims. The pair appeared before Welshpool Magistrates' Court on Tuesday and stood together in the dock wearing face masks. They spoke only to confirm their names, ages and address, but did not enter any pleas. Helen Tench, prosecuting, asked both defendants to remain on conditional bail and not to have contact with anyone under the age of 18. They will appear before Mold Crown Court on April 14. The case is believed to be the first time parents have been charged with such an offence. In 2014, two parents were arrested on suspicion of cruelty and neglect of their obese child. A 49-year-old man and a 44-year-old woman, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, were questioned by officers over the child's care and released on bail. At the time of the separate case, Norfolk Police said intervention at this level was ""very rare"" and only occurred where other attempts to protect the child had been unsuccessful. According to reports, the 11-year-old boy in the case was 5ft 1in tall and 15 stone, with a body mass index (BMI) of 41.8. ""When dealing with sensitive issues such as obesity and neglect of children, officers from the force's Child Abuse Investigation Unit work closely with partners, significantly with both health care and social services, to ensure any response to address them are proportionate and necessary,"" Norfolk Police said in 2014.

3/24/2022,"(Reuters) -Russia on Wednesday condemned what it called a ""reckless"" Polish proposal to send international peacekeepers into Ukraine and warned that it could lead to a direct clash between Russian and NATO forces. Poland said last Friday it would formally submit a proposal for a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine at the next NATO summit. Asked about the initiative, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""It would be a very reckless and extremely dangerous decision."" He told reporters on a conference call that any possible contact between Russian and NATO forces ""could have clear consequences that would be hard to repair"". Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces. Speaking in Kyiv last week, Poland's ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said: ""I think that it is necessary to have a peace mission - NATO, possibly some wider international structure - but a mission that will be able to defend itself, which will operate on Ukrainian territory."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also attacked the proposal in remarks to staff and students at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations on Wednesday. ""This will be the direct clash between the Russian and NATO armed forces that everyone has not only tried to avoid but said should not take place in principle,"" he said.

3/24/2022,"Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings have devolved into a festival of racist dog whistles, so much so that Republican senators who aren’t even on the Judiciary Committee are trying to get in on the action. Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) went so far as to tell reporters on Tuesday that he doesn’t believe interracial marriage should be legal nationwide, before later walking back his comments, claiming he didn’t understand the question. The question, however, was pretty explicit. More from Rolling Stone Twerking, Time Warps and Tenacious D: A Viewer's Guide to the Daniels Lykke Li Returns After Two Years With Haunting New Track 'No Hotel' So You Got a Pandemic Puppy... Here's How to Keep Them Happy Once You Go Back to Work “You would be okay with the Supreme Court leaving the issue of interracial marriage to the states?” Braun was asked. “Yes,” he said. “If you are not wanting the Supreme Court to weigh in on issues like that, you are not going to be able to have your cake and eat it too.” The remarks came after Braun told reporters that he didn’t want a justice who was an “activist,” and that the court’s decision on Roe v. Wade was an example of such activism. Braun argued that such issues should be left up to the states and that striking down Roe would bring “it back to a neutral point, to where that issue should never have been federalized.” This prompted the question about whether he felt the same way about interracial marriage, which the court legalized in 1967, to which Braun, again, said yes. He tried to walk back the comments. “There is no question the Constitution prohibits discrimination of any kind based on race, that is not something that is even up for debate, and I condemn racism in any form,” he said, according to NBC News. Jackson is the first Black woman to be nominated to sit on the Supreme Court. She introduced her husband, who attended the hearing with one of their daughters, in an emotional moment on Monday. “I have no doubt that without him by my side from the very beginning of this incredible professional journey, none of this would have been possible,” she said. “We met in college more than three decades ago, and since then he’s been the best husband, father, and friend I could have ever imagined. Patrick, I love you.” Braun’s comments on Tuesday indicate he believes that states should have the right to prohibit Jackson and her husband, who is white, from being married.

3/24/2022,"Ukraine is believed to be running out of weapons as it continues to hold off Russian forces, amid warnings some countries have failed to send promised aid. Western nations have thrown their support behind the war-torn nation following Vladimir Putin's invasion on 24 February. According to The Times, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told Boris Johnson that his country was getting through a week's supply of weapons in just 20 hours as the Russian attack and constant shelling comes on multiple fronts. But while many countries have promised weapons to help bolster the Ukrainian arsenal, some have not kept up the supply. Paul Grod, president of the Ukrainian World Congress, told the newspaper that some nations – including Germany and France – had not delivered promised arms.

""I can clearly say that further Strela deliveries are on the way,"" Baerbock told the Bundestag lower house of parliament. ""We are one of the biggest weapons suppliers in this situation, it doesn't make us proud but it's what we must do to help Ukraine,"" she added. According to The Times, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has said the military only has a fortnight of anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles left. Some countries have sent extra weapons in previous days, which he said has only “partially improved” the situation. Ukrainian troops are also said to have resorted to using captured Russian “trophies”, such as vehicles and other equipment, to boost its own supplies and use against the invading force.

The Ukrainian armed forces have put up a fierce defence of their country, which is said to have taken Putin by surprise. Western intelligence officials believe Putin could be forced to resort to even more brutal tactics, including the use of chemical weapons. Western intelligence has suggested they may be opting to use more offensive tactics as the war goes on. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said on Thursday: ""We have seen indications that the Ukrainians are going a bit more on the offense now.

3/24/2022,"A deadeye game warden is being praised for his unorthodox rescue of a trapped deer in Pennsylvania. Responding to a recent call from an eastern Pennsylvania resident, game warden Ryan Zawada arrived to find a buck stuck in a net by an antler, photos shared in a state game commission social media post show. How long the buck had been caught, wildlife officials didn’t say. But the vineyard netting at the Berks County property — which appears to have been long enough to touch the ground — was wrapped up tight around the top of the animal’s left antler, and it wasn’t letting go. Standing before the panicked buck, Zawada weighed his options, according to the post. Under different circumstances, it might have been possible to tranquilize or “chemically immobilize” the deer, but given the fear and stress it was already under, Zawada worried the chemical option might induce a heart attack. Getting up close and simply cutting the deer free didn’t seem like a good idea either, too much risk of harm for both man and deer. Zawada decided on a third option. He grabbed a shotgun, took a knee, lined up a shot on the tangled antler and fired. The blast severed the antler but seemed to miss its owner entirely. Freed and afraid, the buck dashed away and bounded out of sight, photos show. A piece of its antler was still hanging from the tangled net. Many were impressed by Zawada’s marksmanship, with dozens commenting “amazing shot,” and “that shot is one-in-a-million.” “Great shot by the officer, as well as the person behind the camera!!,” a comment read. “Well, the buck’ll be real happy once his ears stop ringing,” read another. While Zawada’s out-of-the-box plan worked just about perfectly, wildlife officials said there was also a plan D. “Under these conditions, SGW Zawada was confident he could shoot the antler off and free the deer,” the state game commission said. “On the off chance that SGW Zawada would have missed and shot the deer, the meat would have been donated to local families in need.” ‘Brave’ bobcat attacks 120-pound python and eats its eggs, Florida trail camera shows Church burglary call leads cops to wild intruder on top of freezer, Alabama photos show Moose sneaks up on hiker before charging at him and his dog, Idaho officials say Chihuahua escapes after ‘extremely bold’ predator snatches it from Texas backyard",U.S./State College Centre Daily Times,"‘Amazing shot!’ Deer stuck in net rescued by well-placed shotgun blast, PA photos show",https://news.yahoo.com/amazing-shot-deer-stuck-net-162221838.html
3/24/2022,"Arnold Schwarzenegger’s video appeal to the Russian people has been remarkably effective. The famed film star and former California governor posted it not only on Twitter, but also on Telegram, which is used almost exclusively by Russians. For days, Russian state media tried to ignore it altogether—but millions of views across multiple platforms forced them to address Schwarzenegger’s powerful message. “That face is the cover page of American imperialism and colonialism,” TV host Vadim Gigin declared on state TV show Sunday Evening With Vladimir Solovievon, raging about Arnold Schwarzenegger and his video clip. “Not the caricature image of Uncle Sam, but this Schwarz, in a Hollywood production.” Wild Kremlin TV Hosts Threaten the U.S. With Nuclear Strikes Unless Sanctions End and Reparations Are Paid Gigin seemed particularly peeved with the first comments Arnold made in his video. In an effort to dodge state media’s propensity to immediately dismiss any criticism as “Russophobia,” Arnold had opened his address with reminders of his fondness for the Russian people, with years of positive interactions long before Vladimir Putin started a full-fledged war against Ukraine. “He, in California, will tell us, who live here… the truth?! That is their approach towards us,” Gigin fumed. Visibly furious, Gigin recounted the second half of Schwarzenegger’s video, where he mentioned the cup gifted to him by champion weightlifter Yury Vlasov, which Arnold continues to use to this very day. Gigin opined that Schwarzenegger never understood Vlasov, who opposed the dissolution of the Soviet Union. “Vlasov couldn’t transfer any of his brain [to Schwarzenegger] with his handshake and the gifted cup,” he sniped. Host Vladimir Soloviev then chimed in by pointing out: “Schwarzenegger twice traveled to Iraq to support the American troops and never tried to tell the Iraqi people why they’re being destroyed.” It’s not only state media pundits who are outraged with Arnold’s video. Russian powerlifter champion Maryana Naumova, who has expressed her admiration for the likes of notorious Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad, weighed in with her response to the message, which was published by the Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda on Monday. In her commentary, Naumova accused the American film star of “living in an alternative, imaginary reality.” Baselessly accusing the Ukrainian government of Nazism, she claimed: “The fact that Mr. Zelensky, as you say, is a Jew, did not help them. Nazism has no nationality, Nazism is not based on the word ‘German.’ And Russophobia is no better than anti-Semitism.” Referring to Schwarzenegger’s famed feature films, Naumova proclaimed: “Do you remember how in the second part of the Terminator your hero goes back in time to prevent the creation of Skynet, which would bring the death of all mankind? Russia's special military operation does not aim to destroy the Ukrainian people. It is aimed at the neo-Nazi Skynet, which over the years has completely subjugated Ukraine and was about to turn into an uncontrollable monster, dangerous for all of its neighbors, not only for us... Don’t side with Skynet, Terminator.” Zakhar Prilepin, a famous Russian writer who boasted of “killing many” in the last war in Donbas, and who is wanted by Ukraine’s SBU security service on charges of “taking part in the activity of a terrorist organization,” also had harsh words for Arnold. Prilepin wrote on his Telegram channel: “In his video message, Schwarzenegger, who killed three million Russians in his films, told the Russian people how much he loves us and how wrong we are about Ukraine... This Austrian, the son of his father, who served in the SS and was wounded near Leningrad, is trying to act as the good cop.” Russian Forces Destroy Massive Kyiv Mall, Killing at Least Eight Prilepin complained that the United States is “pumping Ukraine full of weapons to massacre the Russians,” failing to mention that Russia is the aggressor in this war. He added: “Arnie, you are a predator and an enemy.” As a guest on Soloviev’s Sunday show, Prilepin stressed that the Russians shouldn’t try to convince the West of their humanity and good will. He argued that Russia’s approach towards the West should be as harsh as possible: “If they’re seriously afraid of the conflict with Russia, of WWIII, of nuclear war or the escalation of the conflict, we should be convincing them that we’re ready for it, that we love it, that we like to make war.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/24/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Wednesday threw out Wisconsin state legislative maps that were preferred by the state's Democratic governor and selected by Wisconsin’s top court. But while the justices in an unsigned opinion threw out voting maps the Wisconsin Supreme Court had selected for the State Assembly and Senate, they left in place state congressional maps. The state's highest court selected the maps from a range of options after lawmakers couldn't agree. Republicans had complained that Gov. Tony Evers’ maps moved too many people to increase the number of Assembly districts with a majority of Black and Hispanic voters from six to seven in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled 4-3 in favor of adopting Evers’ maps earlier this month, with a conservative justice joining three liberals in the majority. Republicans immediately appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the maps drawn by Evers were racially gerrymandered. The Wisconsin Supreme Court failed to consider whether a “race-neutral alternative that did not add a seventh majority-black district would deny black voters equal political opportunity,” the Supreme Court said. The analysis done by the Wisconsin Supreme Court did not adhere to U.S. Supreme Court precedents “and its judgment cannot stand,” the nation’s high court said. The justices sent the case back to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, saying it is “free to take additional evidence if it prefers to reconsider the Governor’s maps rather than choose from among the other submissions.” They said their action would give Wisconsin's high court ""sufficient time to adopt maps"" in time for the state's Aug. 9 primary. Sachin Chheda, director of the Fair Elections Project, said the ruling throws Wisconsin’s legislative elections into “chaos” just three weeks before candidates can start collecting signatures on nomination papers to get on the fall ballot. “Never has it been clearer that the US Supreme Court majority will do anything it can to advance Republican interests, rather than the law, the Constitution, and the will of the people,” Chheda said. Two justices, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, said they disagreed with their colleagues' decision. “I would allow that process to unfold, rather than further complicating these proceedings with legal confusion,” Sotomayor wrote. The Legislature redraws Wisconsin’s congressional and legislative district maps every 10 years to reflect population changes. The process, known as redistricting, can solidify the partisan majority in the Legislature for a decade. With the stakes so high, Evers and Republican lawmakers couldn’t agree on a plan, leading to both sides asking the state Supreme Court to choose between each side’s maps. Democrats would have made some marginal gains under Evers’ plan but Republicans would maintain their majorities in the Assembly and Senate, according to an analysis from the governor’s office. Currently, Republicans hold a 61-38 majority in the Assembly and a 21-12 advantage in the Senate. In 2018, Democrats won every statewide race but Republicans held more than 60% of legislative seats. Republicans blamed bad Democratic candidates, in part, while Democrats argued that gerrymandering enshrined the GOP advantage. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled 4-3 in favor of adopting Evers’ maps earlier this month. Republicans immediately appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the maps drawn by Evers were racially gerrymandered. Wisconsin's Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul, who defended Evers, called the Supreme Court's ruling “shocking” and consistent with “political activism” from the conservative majority on the court. “It’s now created massive uncertainty going forward,” Kaul said. “We’re going back to the drawing board on this and I think there’s going to be a lot of litigation ahead.” ___ Associated Press writer Todd Richmond contributed to this report.

The students were in a passenger vehicle that collided with a semi about 12:30 p.m. in Tishomingo, a rural city of about 3,000 located about 100 miles (161 kilometers) southeast of Oklahoma City, according to OHP spokesperson Sarah Stewart. The girls were eastbound on Oklahoma 22 when their vehicle was struck by a rock hauler that was approaching from the east on U.S. 377, OHP Trooper Shelby Humphrey told KXII-TV of nearby Sherman, Texas. Maps show the intersection is at the end of a 90-degree curve of U.S. 377 from east to south. The girls’ car was making a right turn when it collided with the truck, Humphrey said. Stewart said she did not have the exact ages of the students, but all six victims were female. The condition of the semi driver was not immediately known. Images from the scene of the crash showed a virtually destroyed black vehicle with what appeared to be a pink steering wheel among the rubble. Tishomingo Public School Superintendent Bobby Waitman said in a Facebook post that the district had “a great loss” involving students from the district's high school. “Our hearts are broken, and we are grieving with our students and staff,” said Waitman, who did not immediately return a phone call on Tuesday. Waitman said counselors would be available at the high school throughout the night Tuesday and that school would be open on Wednesday with a focus on “the emotional well-being of our students.” ___ This story was first published March 22, 2022.

3/24/2022,"Ukraine says it's killed at least five Russian generals, an unusually high total for senior officers. A European diplomat told Foreign Policy that poor communications were leaving commanders exposed. Russia is sustaining high overall casualties in its invasion of Ukraine. Russian generals are moving into advanced positions leaving them exposed to attacks because they're struggling to get their orders through to conscripts, a European official told Foreign Policy magazine. Ukrainian officials have said Ukrainian forces have killed at least five Russian generals so far. Such a toll is unusually high for such senior officers. On Saturday, Ukraine said its forces had killed Lt. Gen. Andrei Mordvichev when they struck an airfield near Kherson, one of the few Ukrainian cities Russia has managed to occupy. On Sunday, Russian officials said a senior naval commander, Andrei Paly, had been killed by Ukrainian forces near the besieged city of Mariupol. A European diplomat briefed on intelligence reports told Foreign Policy that a failure of Russian communications systems was leaving generals exposed to interception and targeted strikes. The diplomat also said that difficulties in getting conscripted troops to follow orders were making them take positions close to the front. The Russian military is using conscripts alongside its regular military in the invasion of Ukraine, despite having promised that it would not. Experts have said conscripted troops are often poorly trained and have low morale. ""They're struggling on the front line to get their orders through,"" the European diplomat said. ""They're having to go to the front line to make things happen, which is putting them at much greater risk than you would normally see."" The diplomat said that about 20% of Russia's top commanders in Ukraine had been killed in the conflict, reducing its military effectiveness and stalling its advance. The theory corroborates a report published Monday by Insider's Christopher Woody. The report cited a US official as saying Russian generals were at inherently greater risk than their US counterparts because of a Russian command structure that gives lower-ranking officers less autonomy and demands closer involvement of generals. US officials believe that about 7,000 Russian troops have been killed in the fighting so far. On Monday, a Russian tabloid reported, citing the country's defense ministry, that the death toll was higher than 9,000, but it subsequently retracted the claim.

3/24/2022,"Russia may have suffered between 30,000 and 40,000 battlefield casualties in Ukraine, according to a senior Nato military officer. The military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by Nato, added between 7,000 and 15,000 Russians had been killed since it invaded its neighbour on 24 February. The estimate of those killed is based on information from the Ukrainian government, indications from Russia, and open-source data, Associated Press reported. It is Nato’s first public estimate of Russian casualties since the beginning of the war. The US government has largely declined to provide public estimates of Russian or Ukrainian casualties, saying available information is of questionable reliability. Watch: Mariupol residents suffer continued fighting almost a month since the Russian invasion The Nato military officer, in a briefing from the alliance’s military headquarters in Belgium on Wednesday, said the estimate of 30,000 to 40,000 Russian casualties is derived from what he called a standard calculation that in war an army suffers three wounded soldiers for every soldier killed. The officer said the casualties include killed in action and wounded in action, and those taken prisoner or missing in action. The exact toll on Putin's forces is unknown. Earlier this week, Western intelligence officials placed the tally of Russian deaths at a ""reasonable estimate"" of 10,000. If true, this would represent the heaviest number of Russian casualties since the Second World War. This figure appeared to match a report in a pro-Kremlin Russian newspaper called Komsomolskaya Pravda on Tuesday, which cited Russian Defence ministry data confirming 9,861 troops had died. However, the death tally was quickly deleted from the article with the newspaper later accusing hackers of planting fake news on its website. Russia has not officially updated its casualty figures since stating on 2 March that 498 servicemen had been killed and 1,597 wounded. Read more: Putin's invasion has killed over 120 children, Ukraine says What is clear, however, is that Russian forces have taken heavy losses in the four weeks since the invasion began. They have been frozen in place for at least a week on multiple fronts and face supply problems and fierce resistance. As a consequence, Russia has turned to siege tactics and bombardment, causing massive destruction and many civilian deaths. Despite its losses so far, Russia may still be hoping to make more gains on the battlefield, especially in the east, in territory including Mariupol, which Moscow demands Ukraine cede to Russian-backed separatists. But in a daily intelligence update, the UK's defence ministry said the entire battlefield across northern Ukraine – which includes huge armoured columns that once bore down on Kyiv – was now ""static"", with the invaders apparently trying to reorganise. A veteran aide of president Vladimir Putin has also resigned over the war and left Russia with no intention to return, two sources said on Wednesday, making him the first senior official to break with the Kremlin since Putin launched his invasion a month ago. The Kremlin confirmed that the aide, Anatoly Chubais, had resigned of his own accord.

Speaking on local television, Arestovych said Russia had already lost 40% of its attacking forces and played down the prospect of Russia waging nuclear war. Nato will likely decide on Thursday to ramp up military forces on its eastern flank, the head of the alliance said, while also warning Russia against using nuclear weapons.
