4/21/2022,"By Jonathan Stempel (Reuters) - Airbus on Wednesday defeated an appeal by the estate of Chuck Yeager, the U.S. Air Force pilot who broke the sound barrier, accusing the aerospace company of using his name and likeness without permission to promote its A380 plane and high-speed Racer helicopter. Yeager had sued Airbus SE in 2019 for trademark infringement and violating his right of publicity. He died in 2020 at age 97. The famous combat and test pilot objected to an A380 sales video shown to employees that contained footage from his 2008 visit to Airbus facilities in Europe. Yeager also challenged a 2017 Airbus promotional statement on its website touting the helicopter's efficiency, which quoted an executive saying: ""Seventy years ago, Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier. We're trying to break the cost barrier."" But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California, said a lower court judge properly dismissed the case because she lacked jurisdiction, reflecting how neither the video nor the press statement was aimed at California, where Yeager had sued. In a 3-0 decision, the panel said Yeager did not allege that anyone in California saw the video, and California's large aerospace industry ""does not establish that a website with global viewership and scope was expressly aimed at the state."" Lawyers for Yeager's estate and for Airbus did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Yeager became the first person to break the speed of sound, Mach 1, piloting his rocket engine-powered Bell X-1 over Rogers Dry Lake in Southern California on Oct. 14, 1947. He become familiar to a younger generation when the actor Sam Shepard portrayed him in the 1983 movie, ""The Right Stuff,"" based on the Tom Wolfe book about the early years of the American space program.

4/21/2022,"Donald Trump remains as factually challenged as ever. That’s about the only concrete takeaway from a teaser released Wednesday of Piers Morgan’s interview of the former president, in which the two oddly shiny men discuss the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost to Joe Biden. Based on the brief clip, Trump appeared to react poorly to questions from Morgan, a conservative former British TV host who at one time considered Trump a “good friend.” Trump has famously protested the 2020 election results, but hasn’t supplied any hard evidence to support his claim that he rightfully won. His attempts to prove his case failed decisively in court, where he lost 61 of the 62 lawsuits he filed challenging the election. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected Trump’s appeals without comment. “With respect, you haven’t produced the hard evidence,” Morgan says at one point in the teaser clip, as Trump attempts to speak over him. Elsewhere, Trump gets in a zinger at Morgan: “I don’t think you’re real!” The clip ends with Trump grumbling “Turn the camera off ... Very dishonest,” and walking away from where he and Morgan had been sitting. The full interview is scheduled to air in the U.S. on Monday, April 25, on Fox Nation, Fox News’s streaming service.

MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell told Insider this week that he would be willing to talk to the January 6 panel investigating the Capitol riot on one condition — that they broadcast his testimony live on national TV. Speaking to Insider on Wednesday evening, Lindell said he has ""nothing to hide"" and would testify if subpoenaed on that condition. ""If they ever subpoena me, I would love to talk to them because I want it to be nationally televised,"" Lindell said. ""I would love to say what I want to say on national TV. And they would try and do without TVs, but my lawyers would say: 'No, no, no! We gotta have it live!'"" In his conversation with Insider, the pillow CEO said that while he was willing to talk, he thought the January 6 panel investigation was ""election deflection"" and a ""big charade.""

It's all part of the biggest cover-up of the biggest crime in the history of the planet."" Lindell has repeatedly made baseless claims that the election was stolen from former President Donald Trump. Lindell's phone records were subpoenaed by the House committee in January this year in connection with their investigation into the Capitol riot. In response, Lindell sued the House select committee and Verizon in a bid to block the release of these phone records. Lindell denied in a conversation with Insider in January that he was part of any meetings in the run-up to the ""Save America"" rally and the ensuing Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. However, a Facebook post from Daniel Beck, the CEO of Idaho-based software company Txtwire, places Lindell at a meeting at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, on January 5, 2021. Lindell also denied that he was at that meeting with Beck. In recent weeks, other Trump-linked individuals have also been subpoenaed and testified to the committee, including Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, her husband Jared Kushner, and Donald Trump Jr.'s fiancée Kimberly Guilfoyle. However, a subpoena has yet to be extended to Lindell to compel him to testify before the panel.

4/21/2022,"LUDINGTON, Mich. (AP) — Sprawled like a gigantic swimming pool atop a bluff overlooking Lake Michigan is an asphalt-and-clay pond holding enough water to produce electricity for 1.6 million households. It's part of the Ludington Pumped Storage Plant, which uses simple technology: Water is piped from a lower reservoir — the lake, in this case — to an upper one, then released downhill through supersized turbines. Supporters call these systems “the world's largest batteries"" because they hold vast amounts of potential energy for use when needed for the power grid. The hydropower industry considers pumped storage the best answer to a question hovering over the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy to address climate change: where to get power when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. “I wish we could build 10 more of these. I love 'em,"" Eric Gustad, community affairs manager for Consumers Energy, said during a tour of the Ludington facility. But the utility based in Jackson, Michigan, has no such plans. Environmental and logistical challenges and potential costs in the billions led Consumers to sell another would-be site near the lake years ago. It's now upgrading the existing plant with co-owner DTE Energy. Constructing a new one “doesn't make financial sense,"" Gustad said. “Unless we get some help from the state or federal government, I don't see it happening any time soon."" STUCK IN NEUTRAL The company's decision illustrates the challenges facing pumped storage in the U.S., where these systems account for about 93% of utility-scale energy in reserve. While analysts foresee soaring demand for power storage, the industry's growth has lagged. The nation has 43 pumped storage facilities with a combined capacity of 22 gigawatts, the output of that many nuclear plants. Yet just one small operation has been added since 1995 — and it's unknown how many of more than 90 planned can overcome economic, regulatory and logistical barriers that force long delays. Three projects have obtained licenses from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, but none are being built. Developers of a  long-planned Oregon facility expect work to begin in 2023. A Montana company that got a license five years ago needs a utility to operate the plant and buy its storage capacity before construction starts. By contrast, more than 60 are being built worldwide, mostly in Europe, India, China and Japan. “The permitting process is crazy,” Malcolm Woolf, president of the National Hydropower Association, complained during a January hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, saying it involves too many agencies. Although FERC permits new facilities and relicenses existing ones, other federal, state and tribal offices have roles, spokesperson Celeste Miller said. “Every project is unique. All have various case-specific issues,” she said. The industry is lobbying for an investment tax credit similar to what solar and wind get. President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better plan includes the tax break but is stuck in Congress. Pumped storage dates from the early 1930s. But most systems were built decades later to warehouse excess electricity from nuclear plants and release it when needed. The storage facilities also serve as a safety net in sudden power interruptions. When a New England nuclear unit tripped offline in 2020, Woolf said, “the lights in Boston didn't flicker” because two pumped storage stations provided backup power. While nuclear, coal and natural gas plants can operate continuously, wind and solar can't — so the market for reserve power likely will grow.  National Renewable Energy Laboratory models show U.S. storage capacity may rise fivefold by 2050. “We’re going to bring hundreds of gigawatts of clean energy onto the grid over the next few years and we need to be able to use that energy wherever and whenever it’s needed,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said last year. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION Using computer mapping, Australian National University engineers identified more than 600,000 “potentially feasible” pumped storage sites worldwide — including 32,000 in the U.S. — that could store 100 times the energy needed to support a global renewable electricity network. But the study didn't examine whether sites would meet environmental or cultural protection standards or be commercially viable. Its website acknowledged, “Many or even most ... may prove to be unsuitable."" Environmentalists are cool toward pumped storage because reservoirs typically are formed by hydropower dams, which block fish pathways, damage water quality and emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Also, most plants continuously draw water from rivers. But recent designs envision “closed-loop” systems that tap a surface or underground supply, then repeatedly cycle that water between reservoirs. Water would be added only to make up for evaporation or leaks. The Hydropower Reform Coalition, representing conservation groups, says it might support such projects under “very limited circumstances.” Yet some are drawing resistance, including the Goldendale Energy Storage Project in Washington state. It would pipe water between two 60-acre (24.3-hectare) reservoirs on opposite sides of a hill. The facility could power nearly 500,000 homes for up to 12 hours, according to Rye Development, spearheading the project. It's seeking FERC licensing and is scheduled to go online in 2028 but still needs a state water quality permit. Environmental groups fear harm to wetlands and wildlife habitat, while tribes say the project would encroach on a sacred site. “What are we willing to sacrifice to get this technology online?"" said Bridget Moran, an associate director of American Rivers. Developers say the project would include cleanup of the polluted lower reservoir area. The U.S. Department of Energy has launched a web-based tool to help developers find the best locations. A recent Michigan Technological University study identified hundreds of abandoned U.S. mines that could host pumped storage, with upper reservoirs at or near the surface and lower ones below ground. They are close enough to transmission and distribution infrastructure and to solar and wind generating facilities, the report says. “All these holes in the ground are ready to go,"" said study co-leader Roman Sidortsov, an energy policy associate professor. But while some decommissioned mines might be better for the environment, a project in New York's Essex County stalled over water pollution concerns. COMPETITIVE FUTURE As the market for stored energy grows, new technologies are emerging. Texas-based Quidnet Energy has developed a pumped storage offshoot that forces water underground, holds it amid rock layers and releases it to power turbines. The company announced a project in March with San Antonio's municipal utility. Energy Vault, a Swiss startup, devised a crane powered by renewable energy to lift and stack 35-ton bricks. When energy is needed, the bricks are lowered by cables that spin a generator. For now, batteries are the leading competitor to pumped storage plants, which can generate power for eight to 16 hours. Lithium-ion batteries typically last up to four hours but longer-duration ones are in the works. “Are we going to get to the point where an eight-hour battery is cheaper than a pumped storage plant? That’s the billion-dollar question,” said Paul Denholm, an analyst with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. A 2016 Energy Department report said the U.S. network has a potential for 36 gigawatts of new pumped storage capacity. “We don’t think pumped storage is the be-all, end-all but it’s a vital part of our storage future,” said Cameron Schilling, vice president of markets for the hydropower association. “You can’t decarbonize the system without it.” ___ Follow John Flesher on Twitter: @JohnFlesher",Business/Associated Press,Energy shift creates opening for 'world's largest batteries',https://news.yahoo.com/energy-shift-creates-opening-worlds-160929667.html

4/21/2022,"Great whites in the Florida Keys can be a rare sight. The large migratory predators prefer cooler water and are just passing through when they’re spotted in South Florida. But when they do show up, most anglers, divers and others on the water view it as a treat. That was the case when Amanda Callahan, Chris Marotti, Fred Lewie and Eric Rasmussen, all of Cudjoe Key in the Lower Keys, went out for a day of fishing Friday. At about 1:30 in the afternoon, they were about seven miles southwest of the American Shoal lighthouse in 280 feet of water when a male great white began cruising around Rasmussen’s Calcutta open fisherman boat. “The Gulfstream was in close that day and all the right conditions were present, the right time of day, current, tide, water temp and wind which made for a lot of activity,” Callahan told the Miami Herald/FLKeysnews.com. Callahan, an avid diver and angler, began filming the shark both underwater and on the surface. She posted the footage on her Aquablu Youtube channel. “The fishing and diving this last holiday weekend was great. We estimated the great white to be around 11 to 12 feet in length as the boat’s beam [width] is around 9 feet and the shark easily exceeded that,” Callahan said. “A healthy 12-foot male great white shark would weigh around 1,000 pounds.” They knew it was a male by the two claspers in between the shark’s front pelvic and rear anal fins, Callahan said. The way the shark was swimming, Callahan said it wasn’t in feeding mode and didn’t appear too interested in the boat or the people on board splashing to get its attention. “He wasn’t feeding because we threw a dead bonito, and he wasn’t interested,” Callahan said. “But, it was awesome to see.” Callahan, 31, is a professional scuba instructor and rebreather diver, who has been diving for over six years. “We don’t want to encourage people to get in the water with an apex predator, and this stuff should only be done under the supervisor of professionals,” she said. Moretti, Callahan’s boyfriend, is also a longtime diver. “The other two guys have decades of angling experience in the Lower Keys,” she said. Mahmood Shivji, professor at Nova Southeastern University’s department of Biological Sciences and the director of the Guy Harvey Research Institute, said white sharks “are long-distance travelers as a natural part of their life-cycle, and have been known to move through South Florida waters during their migrations.” When they’re not migrating, they prefer cooler ocean waters, and that’s where they tend to hang out. “White sharks are one of only a handful of sharks that can keep their core body temperatures warm, and so can roam in cooler waters,” Shivji said. White sharks are not listed as endangered, but they are federally managed, and it is not legal to harvest them. Shivji calls them “an absolute marvel of evolution,” and cited recent research at Nova’s Halmos College of Arts and Sciences as an example. In that work, researchers at the South Florida school sequenced the whole genome of the white shark species. Shivji said the scientists “found remarkable positive genetic changes in many of its genes” that make its genome more stable. This could have positive impacts on human medicine since unstable genomes result in cancer. Shivji said the research also found positive changes in the sharks’ genes involved in their wound-healing process that might explain how the fish are able to recover so quickly from injuries. “It’s a privilege to see such an amazing animal live in its natural habitat,” Shivji said after seeing Callahan’s video.",U.S./Miami Herald,Watch what happens when a great white shark circles a fishing boat in the Florida Keys,https://news.yahoo.com/watch-happens-great-white-shark-204046756.html

4/21/2022,"By Michael Erman (Reuters) - Moderna Inc on Tuesday said a COVID-19 booster designed to target the Beta variant as well as the original coronavirus generated a better immune response against a number of virus variants including Omicron. Moderna said the results were a good sign for the company's plans for future shots targeting two COVID-19 variants. Dr. Jacqueline Miller, a top Moderna scientist, said the company had no immediate plans to file for authorization of the bivalent vaccine including the Beta variant. It will submit the data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in order to lay the groundwork for a future bivalent vaccine candidate that includes the Omicron variant as a target. The company said the bivalent vaccine with Beta generated higher neutralizing antibody titers against the Omicron variant at one and six months after the shot was given than the booster of its original vaccine currently in use. The company said it was especially encouraging that the bivalent vaccine induced higher antibody responses against variants that were not specifically included in the vaccine. The 50-microgram bivalent booster, which the company calls mRNA 1273.211, was tested in 300 people. Moderna has started testing a different bivalent shot that combines an Omicron-specific vaccine with its original. Initial data from that vaccine is expected later in the second quarter, Moderna said. It is also testing a monovalent booster targeted at Omicron alone. ""In order to be ready for the fall, we've had to start manufacture at risk,"" Miller said. ""Our belief is that the bivalent, based on the data that we have already observed ... offers the best hope for longer and more durable protection.""
