4/7/2022,"The life of a chef has many advantages but routine is not one of them. Easter at home offers the perfect excuse for the sort of Sunday lunch I wish we had every week. A feast embedded in ritual and tradition. Before I had family of my own, the Easter table was a gathering of friends and cousins. I made the hearty northern Italian food of Emilia-Romagna where my aunt Dina lives. In Parma, the first signs of spring mean earliest pea and bean pods and delicate young stalks of asparagus. Things are more of a gamble in the UK, but I’m always hopeful spring will come early and our farm box will contain some jewels nestled among the roots. I have a weekend of celebration in mind: a Neapolitan mussel soup traditionally eaten on Maundy Thursday; the fish that would appear on Good Friday, given a twist in its punchy oily bath. You can’t have Easter without eggs, and I’ve ticked that box with an egg-rich, creamy pasta with fine strands of shaved asparagus that my wife devoured in an exhausted heap, clamouring for bread to mop up the spectacular sauce. That’s Saturday night sorted. Lamb cooked in pecorino is for Easter Sunday, with chunks of potato that make it feel almost like a hotpot. It’s a rich little number and we have a lamb’s lettuce salad alongside. Everyone has seconds. In Naples this soup is eaten on Maundy Thursday and Good Friday, with the addition of octopus. Friselle, a type of very hard, biscuited bread roll that resembles an open bagel, are not hard to make if you have a little time and fancy a baking project, but it’s also not that hard to find them for sale in Italian shops or online. A baguette sliced and toasted in the oven is a perfect alternative. If you make your own friselle, allow them to dry properly and the extra will keep until tomatoes are ripe in the summer. Dampen the hard bread with a little water, before topping them with the classic; fresh tomatoes, basil, garlic and olive oil. Serves 4For the soupmussels 1.8kgolive oilgarlic 2 clovesdried red chilli 1, or chilli oilparsley a small bunchtinned plum tomatoes 300g, drained and dicedsea salt For the friselle (makes 10)durum wheat semolina flour 250gwhole wheat flour 250gdried yeast 1 tspwater 300mlsea salt 10g To make the friselle, mix 50g of each of the flours with the yeast and 100ml of the water at a tepid temperature. Stir and allow to stand somewhere warmish for 1½ hours, until doubled and bubbly. Mix in the rest of the flour with the salt and the other 200ml of water. Knead either in the bowl of a mixer with a dough hook or by hand for about 8 minutes, until the softish dough is much more elastic and smooth. Cover and allow to rise again for another hour or two until well risen. Cut the dough into 5 equal pieces and roll into balls. Set apart on baking paper lightly dusted with extra flour. Cover with a towel and set aside for another 30 minutes. Use your thumbs to gently open the rolls in the centre to create doughnuts. Set aside for another hour. Heat the oven to 200C fan/gas mark 7. Bake for 20 minutes, then turn the oven down to 180C fan/gas mark 6. Remove from the oven and, using a cloth in one hand to protect you from the hot rolls, cut them in half laterally. Return the halves to the baking sheet cut side up and bake for another 25-30 minutes. They will be toasty around the edges and the centre will have very slightly sunk. Once cooled they should be hard and will keep very well, so you’ll have extras. For the soup, I like to clean the mussels as soon as I get back from the shops, so they have a while to soak. Clean the shells, strip the beards and give them a rinse, then place in highly sea-salted cold water in the fridge for several hours, even overnight. This purifies them and makes them juicier. Heat a heavy saucepan with a lid over a medium high heat. Add the drained mussels and a splash of fresh water. Cover, shake and cook until all the mussels are open, then empty into a bowl. Return the pan to the heat, add 4 tablespoons of olive oil and fry the garlic and chilli. When they are sizzling, but not too browned, add the parsley and, 1 minute later, the tomatoes. Cook briskly stirring often. The idea is to render the tomatoes to paste. It should take 10 minutes or so. Pick the meat from half the mussels. Pass the juice through a sieve if gritty, otherwise don’t bother. Pour everything into the tomato base and reheat. Put a frisella in each of four warm bowls and cover with the hot mussel liquid and top with the rest of the mussels. Make sure you use all the juice so that they are saturated. Allow to soak for a minute before eating. This dish of tender strips of lamb sitting on soft potatoes is as indulgent as it is straightforward. I made this for friends and had time for a stroll to the brewery for refreshments while the lamb looked after itself. Serves 4boneless breast of lamb 900g (unrolled if sold rolled as a joint)new potatoes 800golive oilgarlic 6 cloves, wholebay leaves 10 freshred wine 200mlpecorino romano 50g, gratedred wine vinegar 3 tbspcapers 1 tbsp Heat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. Cut the lamb into strips about 3cm wide and season with salt. Slice the potatoes about 2cm thick. Heat a wide ovenproof pan with a lid over a medium heat. Add a tablespoon of oil and some of the lamb, skin side down. Allow the lamb to colour and contract as the fat begins to render. Cook for 5 minutes, until golden, then turn them over and do the other side. Remove to a plate and repeat with the rest of the meat. Pour off the fat and return the pan to a lower heat. Add the garlic and bay, fry for 3 minutes, then turn off the heat. Add the potatoes in one layer, the red wine and half of the cheese. Top with the lamb, a liberal grind of coarse black pepper, the red wine vinegar, the capers and the rest of the cheese. Cover, place in the oven and cook for 2 hours. When cooked, remove the lamb from the top and spoon off some of the grease to reveal the red wine pecorino juice beneath. This dish does use a lot of good olive oil, but it’s worthwhile and could not be easier to make. Use only a little salt when cooking the fish as the samphire will add some of its own. I leave chilli and pepper out because my olive oil is excessively peppery – feel free to add it, though, if you’d like to. You can swap the smoked haddock for whatever is in season, but make the recipe well ahead – preferably the day before – so the flavours mingle and the olive oil soaks in and brings everything together. We eat this as a starter with thickly sliced, warm wholemeal bread. Serves 4 as a startersundried tomatoes 50g (the dry ones, not jarred)salted capers 1 tspred wine vinegar 3 tbspgreen olives 75ggarlic 1 clovelemon peel 2 stripsmarsh samphire 100glightly smoked undyed haddock fillet 250g, preferably pin boned, cut into 2 piecesolive oil 150ml Put the sundried tomatoes and capers in a bowl and cover with the red wine vinegar and 200ml of boiling water. Leave to reconstitute for a couple of hours. Squash the olives with your thumb on a board and remove the stones. Cut the garlic clove into paper thin slices. Bring a pot of lightly salted water to the boil with the lemon peel. Add the samphire, then, after a minute, the haddock. Turn the heat down to medium and cook for 2 minutes. Turn the heat off and leave for another minute or 2. Remove the fish with a slotted spoon. If it flakes, it is cooked – if not, return to the hot water. Once cooked, place it in a dish, carefully remove the skin and break into several pieces where it naturally flakes. Drain the samphire and add it to the fish with the drained tomatoes and capers, and the olives and garlic. Cover with olive oil while everything is still warm. Set aside overnight in the fridge until lunch the next day. Cooking the asparagus with the pasta adds a lighter touch to an otherwise massively rich celebratory pasta. Serves 4asparagus 500gonion 1 smallolive oilanchovy fillets 8sea saltspaghetti, linguini or bucatini 360gegg yolks 2 largeparmesan 50g, gratedblack pepper Trim the ends of the asparagus, cut each spear in half and then into long strips. Slice the onion as finely as possible. In 3 tablespoons of olive oil, sweat the onion over a medium-low heat for 15 minutes, until translucent. Use a tablespoon of water to help if they start to fry. Add the anchovy fillets, stirring until they melt, then turn the heat off. Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Cook the spaghetti for half the time stated on the packet, then add the asparagus to the water. Whisk the yolks well with the grated cheese, add a ladle of pasta-asparagus water and a generous grind of black pepper. Drain the pasta, reserving still more pasta water, then toss well with the anchovy sauce in the still warm pan but off the heat. When mixed, add the egg and continue to mix well. Use extra cooking water if you like it looser. Serve right away on hot plates. The lavender is pungent, strong and very much an optional extra. I’ve only recently rediscovered this flavour having had a bad early experience with lavender ice-cream. I love it, but if I didn’t have gnarled dry lavender in the front garden, I wouldn’t bother at this time of year. Serves 5 garlic 6 clovesjuniper berries 8fennel seeds 1 tsplavender a sprigrosemary leaves 1 tbspthyme leaves 2 tbspsea salt 1½ tbspsugar ½ tbsppork neck 1.2kg, skin removedartichokes 10 mediumlemons 2parsley 4 sprigs, leaves pickedbreadcrumbs 50gcelery 6 sticksonion 1 medium, sliced A day ahead, crush 2 of the garlic cloves in a pestle and mortar with the juniper and fennel seeds. Finely chop the lavender, rosemary and thyme, and add to the garlic with the sea salt and sugar. Mix, then rub it all over the pork and set aside, covered, in the fridge. The next day, tie the pork up with a piece of string in the middle and at the ends to hold it in a rounded joint shape. Bring to room temperature while you heat the oven to 200C fan/gas mark 7 and prepare the artichokes. Remove the toughest outer leaves of the artichokes, snapping or cutting them down with scissors. Trim around the base and stem with a small knife. Trim the stalk and the tips to remove the darkest part of the leaves. Rotate the artichokes upside down and press to open up the leaves a bit and carefully stretch them further with your fingers. Use a teaspoon to scoop out the choke. Rub each one all over with 1 of the lemons, cut in half, to stop them discolouring before you move on to the next. When all prepped, finely slice a garlic clove and stuff it between leaves of an artichoke with some parsley leaves, breadcrumbs, salt and pepper. Repeat with each one. Place a casserole on a medium-high heat with a tablespoon of olive oil and sear the pork all over, positioning its best-looking side up when you’re done. Turn the heat off, then surround the meat with the celery, any remaining garlic, the stuffed artichokes, onion, the juice of the remaining lemon and a splash of water. Cover with a piece of crumpled baking paper and bake for 1¼ hours, or until the pork is hot (above 64C) in the centre. Leave to rest somewhere warm before slicing and serving.

4/7/2022,"By taking the decision to have a child without obtaining official permission, Whitney and Aina are breaking the law. When their crime is discovered they become social outcasts, condemned to serve a 12-year sentence of exile on a remote island in the north. At the croft they must fend for themselves, learning the art of survival in a hostile landscape. They are aided in their endeavour by an annual drop of essential supplies, together with the hope that once the 12 years have passed, they may be allowed to return home. Their punishment is made harder by the fact that toxic spores from the melting permafrost have been released into the atmosphere; anyone spending time in that part of the world must take prophylactic pills at eight-hour intervals to stay alive. These are dispensed via an automated “pill clock”, activated by the thumb print of the designated user, keeping the miscreants effectively tethered to their place of exile. As Whitney and Aina near the end of their sentence, Whitney becomes ever more obsessed by the need to “prove loyal” in order to win parole. Aina, by contrast, has begun to suspect that this promise of freedom has been bogus all along. She is desperate to learn the fate of their son, Max, and fears her husband may be keeping this knowledge to himself. Dystopias in which the state has seized control of women’s bodies are everywhere, from Sophie Mackintosh’s Blue Ticket to Christina Dalcher’s Vox and Joanne Ramos’s The Farm. The influence of The Handmaid’s Tale is clear, though newer writers have not always been as skilful as Margaret Atwood in weaving a credible future from the stuff of now. In his debut novel, Tom Watson seems less interested in the wider political and social reality of his world than in the mundane detail of the characters’ lives and the bleakness of the landscape they inhabit, the emotional standoff that exists between them as a result of the traumatic severing of their previous existence. His use of language is nuanced and sensitive, with landscape writing especially a sensory highlight. His imagining of the sparse and chilly beauty of the island, together with the exiles’ thwarted attempts to make creative sense of both their fate and their surroundings, should make for an engrossing and memorable reading experience. But although the underlying mystery and sense of threat is enough to keep us engaged and turning pages, the narrative eventually becomes overreliant on the deliberate withholding of information. As Whitney and Aina keep secrets from one another, so Watson keeps secrets from us. The cultural references – Giacometti, Copenhagen, the Vikings – indicate a world that is recognisably ours, and a background of accelerating climate change suggests the narrative is taking place in the near future. There are vague mentions of diminishing resources and weather events, of a population in crisis. Yet these avenues remain unexplored. How well readers respond to this novel will depend on how far they are prepared to tolerate an accumulating fuzziness around the facts. The novel’s finer details are made puzzling by the similar lack of a rationale. Whitney and Aina and their former friends appear to remember a time before the invasive restrictions that have come to determine their lives and futures, yet they remain curiously, almost determinedly passive. No one discusses the past, not even in secret. Whitney’s obeisance to the regime is particularly perplexing, most especially in being entirely unexamined. Once again, it is as if the author has come to rely on obfuscation to gain an effect; things are the way they are, not for any real reason but “just because”. There will be readers who respond so strongly to Watson’s transparent prose, to the curiously lulling strangeness of his world, that they can set aside the trivial matter of cause and effect. For this reader, at least, the vastness and profusion of plot holes and the relentlessly accelerating illogic that governs the final quarter of the novel explode any such necessary suspension of disbelief. There is no doubting Watson’s talent at the sentence level, but his lack of rigour around core ideas left me frustrated and unconvinced.  Metronome is published by Bloomsbury (£16.99).

4/7/2022,"Two years ago the world may have been upside down, but all was right in Laker Nation. After a decade of futility the Purple and Gold were on top of the NBA, champions once again. As the confetti fell inside a largely empty arena in the NBA bubble, the best player on the planet had made good on his promise to put the franchise “back in the position where it belongs.” Given the Lakers’ habit of hanging around the NBA finals once they finally break back in, it did indeed seem as if LeBron James & Co were only just getting warmed up. But it turns out that the heat radiating from the afterglow of that victory may well have been the earliest sign of the meltdown to come. On Tuesday, five days before the NBA regular season’s closing curtain, the LeBron-era Lakers hit their nadir. They went to Phoenix with James sidelined through injury and fell to the Suns, 121-110, their seventh defeat in a row. To add insult to injury, the Suns loss ruled the Lakers out of the playoff’s play-in round, a lifeline James once bemoaned quite emphatically. The self-styled GOAT was even roasted at the Oscars, with co-host Regina Hall arguably landing the night’s third-most provocative joke. Even though LA have weathered their share of bad breaks this season – not least a slew of aches, pains and Covid absences that has forced coach Frank Vogel to deploy 24 different players and 39 starting lineups – much of the blame for the Lakers’ wayward prospects should fall at the feet of James, a postseason spectator for just the fourth time in his illustrious career. After all, he isn’t just the straw that stirs the Lakers. He mixes the drink too as shadow general manager, exerting his sweeping influence from inside the locker room and through his player agency, Klutch Sports. Unlike his idol Michael Jordan, whose desire to pick his own teammates was vigorously checked by the gimlet-eyed Bulls general manager Jerry Krause, James has yet to find a front office he couldn’t steamroller. His fingerprints are all over the Lakers’ 2019 trade for Anthony Davis, a wildly talented big man who is oft-injured and generally averse to putting an entire team on his back. They’re all over the August trade for Russell Westbrook, a hall of fame-bound point guard who’s not only missing a steady jump shot but also a modicum of patience. In those trades, Brandon Ingram (24 years old), Kyle Kuzma (26), Lonzo Ball (24) and other fresh legs and potential draft picks were shipped away to maximise the 37-year-old James’s late-career window. James’s fourth year in LA began with him as the centrepiece of a rotation also made up of Westbrook (33), Carmelo Anthony (37), a second tour of Rajon Rondo (36) and a third tour of Dwight Howard (36). Suffice to say: This would’ve been an awesome Cleveland Cavaliers team in 2008. It’s bad enough that James has missed 23 games this season. He resorted to playing heroball, or thoroughly against type. He chased double-doubles and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s all-time scoring mark while the Lakers slipped out of the playoff picture and into irrelevance. During the All-Star break in Cleveland James told The Athletic’s Jason Lloyd that he was entertaining the idea of a second homecoming. In that same interview, James reiterated a desire to play with his eldest son, Bronny – who isn’t near the NBA shoo-in his father was at his age. Unfair, maybe, but remember: James started this. Perhaps most embarrassing: After the LA’s Super Bowl triumph in February, James tossed around an idea for a triple-team ‘parade of champions’ with Rams, Dodgers and Lakers. Again, his title was in 2020. James even brought the typically stoic Abdul-Jabbar to a boil with his shrugging endorsement of a Spider-Man meme that tapped into a broader sense of exasperation in distinguishing from Covid, cold and flu symptoms. (Abdul-Jabbar’s point is that as an outspoken advocate for vaccinations, James can’t afford to be so thoughtless.) In general, James has looked for all the world like pretty much exactly what ESPN’s Brian Windhorst says he is: the peripatetic superstar who burns too bright for any team to hold on to beyond four years. “Call it organisational fatigue,” the dean of Bron-ologists said on the ESPN morning show Get Up. “It happened the first time in Cleveland. They ran out of draft picks, they had a bunch of guys in their mid-30s. … He goes to Miami, four years, great run, they run out of draft picks. In his last game, three guys retired. … He goes to Cleveland, four years, great run. They run out of draft picks, they’ve got old guys. Here we are in LA, fourth year, the oldest team we’ve seen in NBA history, they’re out of draft picks. They’re exhausted.” If the pattern holds, there’s no way James – an unrestricted free agent in 2023 – signs up for two or more years of misery in Los Angeles. Sure, he’ll always be fondly remembered for the championship he won for the city during Covid – the hardest title in history, if you ask him. And one meltdown year isn’t enough to ruin a 20-year standard. He can still call himself king if he likes. He just needs to do the honourable thing and own this Lakers landfill fire as his personal annus horribilis.",Sport/Sport,LeBron James owns plenty of blame in his personal annus horribilis,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/07/lebron-james-lakers-nba-basketball
4/7/2022,"Victoria’s opposition is urging the state’s integrity agencies to investigate government advertising campaigns found to be in breach of state laws due to their political nature. The Victorian auditor general’s office (Vago) report tabled in parliament on Wednesday found the “Our Fair Share” campaign and several Big Build advertisements breached laws passed in 2017 to stop public sector agencies publishing political advertising. This came after the Independent Broad‑based Anti‑corruption Commission (Ibac) and the Victorian ombudsman said in 2019 that they could not justify launching an investigation into the advertisements. Opposition spokesperson Brad Battin on Thursday wrote to Ibac and the ombudsman, urging them to take another look at the advertisements in light of Vago’s findings. “I would respectfully ask that you reconsider this decision and investigate the advertising campaigns referred to in the report as part of your larger investigation into the politicisation of the public service,” his letter, obtained by Guardian Australia, states. The ombudsman is currently investigating whether the public service has been politicised after a referral from state parliament’s upper house earlier this year. The $1.7m Our Fair Share campaign, which ran during the 2019 federal election, advocated for more commonwealth funding for Victorian public schools, healthcare and transport projects. The Vago report said the campaign was political because it could “easily be seen” to promote the Victorian government while attacking the federal government. Two advertisements from the $11.5m campaign for the Big Build, were also found to be unlawful as they promoted the works before providing information in the public interest about disruptions. In 2019, the Ibac and the Victorian ombudsman wrote to the state’s premier, Daniel Andrews, about the Our Fair Share campaign after receiving complaints. In the letter, which was appended to the Vago report, they said an investigation could not be justified. They said it was “highly unlikely” that statements by the heads of the departments involved, in which they said they were “motivated solely by the public interest”, could be contradicted. However, the agencies said the timing and content of the campaign “would have had the effect of influencing public sentiment against the government of the commonwealth. “This would have been the likely perception of a reasonable member of the Victorian public, whatever their political allegiance,” they said in the letter. They proposed amendments to the laws to “reinforce the importance of an apolitical public sector and to advance the wider public interest”. The government, however, did not make any changes. On Thursday, Battin said an investigation should examine “if the premier, ministers, or their respective offices used any undue influence that led to the production of illegal political advertising”. He also stated the creation and approval of these ads potentially breached impartiality requirements under Codes of Conduct for Victorian public sector employees and ministers and parliamentary secretaries. Battin said Victorians deserve the truth as to how millions of dollars were allowed to be spent on unlawful and improper advertisements. “Daniel Andrews has been caught out breaking his own laws and treating people’s money as his own,” he said in a statement. “Victorians deserve the truth as to how and why this occurred.” Andrews, however, continued to defend the advertisements. “These matters have already been looked at by those authorities and they’ve made it very clear what the view is,” Andrews said. “It’s breathtaking that you think lowly of a government that stands up for its state, that’s what we do. That’s what we always do.”",News/Australia news,"‘Political’ government ads should be probed by integrity agencies, Victorian opposition says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/07/political-government-ads-should-be-probed-by-integrity-agencies-victorian-opposition-says
4/7/2022,"UK house prices hit a record of £282,753 in March but are likely to ease over the next year as homebuyers face higher interest rates and the cost of living squeeze, Halifax has said. The average cost of a home rose by 1.4% on February, according to Halifax’s monthly property index, and is 11% higher than a year ago, about the largest annual increase since the 2007 financial crisis. The new record is about £28,113 higher than a year ago, not far off the average UK earnings over the same period of £28,860. March was also the ninth consecutive month that prices have grown, with monthly gains at their highest level since September, when they rose by 1.7%. Average prices have risen by £43,577 since the first coronavirus lockdown in 2020. The sustained increase has been driven by a shortage of houses for sale and an increase in demand for larger homes linked to the pandemic “race for space”. Hybrid working trends and more time spent at home prompted many people living in cities to consider relocating to more rural areas. Russell Galley, Halifax’s managing director, said: “Although there is some recent evidence of more homes coming on to the market, the fundamental issue remains that too many buyers are chasing too few properties.” However, Halifax said the cost of living crisis – with households squeezed by rising energy and food bills – was likely to dampen the increase in house prices over the coming year. The UK’s annual inflation rate reached 6.2% in February, the highest in three decades, and the Bank of England said that figure could rise to 10% later this year, putting further pressure on living standards. It is likely to result in higher interest rates, as part of policymakers’ efforts to keep prices in check. The Bank of England had already increased interest rates to pre-pandemic levels of 0.75% last month. “In the long term, we know the performance of the housing market remains inextricably linked to the health of the wider economy,” Galley said. “There is no doubt that households face a significant squeeze on real earnings, and the difficulty for policymakers in needing to support the economy, yet contain inflation, is now even more acute because of the impact of the war in Ukraine. “Buyers are therefore dealing with the prospect of higher interest rates and a higher cost of living. With affordability metrics already extremely stretched, these factors should lead to a slowdown in house price inflation over the next year.”",News/Business,UK house prices hit record high but cost of living crisis likely to cool market,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/07/uk-house-prices-hit-record-high-but-cost-of-living-crisis-likely-to-cool-market
4/7/2022,"Telstra has launched new technology that automatically scans all text messages for malicious content on its mobile network in a move aimed at halting the explosion in scam SMS messages. The company’s outgoing CEO, Andy Penn, said in a blog post on Thursday the company had witnessed massive growth in reports of scam text messages – particularly the Flubot scam targeting Android devices, which installs malware on the phone to steal credit card and other personal information. He said in 2021 Telstra had 11,000 reports of malicious texts to Android devices, compared to just 50 in 2020. “That’s why we’ve turned on a brand-new feature to find and block SMS scam messages with suspicious links as they travel across our network and stop many of them before they reach your mobile device,” he said. “We know it’s working because our people have been on an internal pilot program for the last three months. Around two and a half thousand employees have taken part and we’ve been successful in detecting and blocking hundreds of scam SMS messages every day.” The technology has been rolled out and switched on for every mobile device on Telstra’s network – including those signed up to other providers using Telstra’s mobile network like Belong. The text messages will be automatically scanned on Telstra’s network before being delivered to customers, and if it looks suspicious – with malicious links or similar patterns and characteristics to other messages – Telstra will block the message from being delivered. Penn said that in some cases, specialists would have to review the contents of text messages that might have been wrongly flagged, but the specialist will not be able to see the details of the intended recipient of the text message. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning There will also be protections to ensure businesses, government departments and emergency alert text messages don’t get flagged and blocked. Penn said while the new filter will block a significant number of scam texts, it is not foolproof, and scammers constantly evolve their tactics. Those who wish to opt out of the system can SMS 0438 214 682 with the words FILTER OFF, or FILTER ON to opt back in. A spokesperson for Optus said the company has advanced filtering and machine learning on its SMS systems, and during 2021 had blocked nearly 30m text messages related to the Flubot scam alone. A Vodafone spokesperson said it began blocking spam and scam texts in 2014, and upgraded its services in 2020 with “a sophisticated SMS firewall that identifies and blocks scammers from reaching our customers.” “Protecting Vodafone customers from the scourge of scams will always be a priority,” the spokesperson said. “Based on a combination of artificial intelligence and user-enabled rulesets, our system has blocked more than 522m scam text messages in the past year alone. In the same period, we have also identified and blocked more than 26m scam calls from reaching our customers.” The telco industry is currently finalising an update to the industry code on scam calls to incorporate requirements for dealing with scam SMS. The chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, told a Senate estimates hearing on Wednesday ScamWatch had noticed a 50% decrease in reported phone-based scams as a result of telecommunications companies taking action. “We believe that’s in part because of disruption by the telecommunications companies alerted by and with information that ScamWatch is providing them,” she said. Cass-Gottlieb said it had caused scammers to switch to investment-related scams, with financial losses up to $72m and cryptocurrency becoming the most common payment method. The ACCC said there was a 90% increase in financial losses from the scams in the first three months of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, with 49,548 reports of losses, and a total of $103m reported as lost to scams in that period.",News/Business,Telstra to scan all text messages for malicious content in anti-scam program,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/07/telstra-to-scan-all-text-messages-for-malicious-content-in-anti-scam-program
4/7/2022,"On the night before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, Alimov Rustam was in Odesa, across the border from his home country of Moldova, to celebrate a friend’s birthday. When his wife awoke to the sound of distant explosions, Rustam tried to reassure her that everything was fine. He soon realised it wasn’t. The next day, the couple left for Moldova to find a line of cars already queueing at the border when they approached. Rustam was used to traveling to Ukraine for his work as a kickboxing trainer. When he learned the scale of the Russian attack, he knew he had to mobilise quickly. Using Viber, a messaging app, he started inviting Ukrainian friends from the kickboxing community to come to Moldova, where he would arrange for their stay. Julia Moisieva and her friend Narine, whose husband is also a kickboxing coach, answered that call. They packed their children into the car and headed for the border, which is usually a short trip from Odesa. Twenty-eight hours later, they arrived in Moldova. For Tymor, Moisieva’s seven-year-old son, Garuda kickboxing gym in Chișinău, Moldova’s capital, was a soft place to land. There, he has a routine that is like his own back in Ukraine, and playmates in the neighbourhood that is now his temporary home. In a second Garuda gym in Trușeni, a village outside the capital, another pair of Ukrainian children have found refuge in kickboxing. Anna Miroshnichenko and Natalie Munteanu were college classmates in Ukraine before Munteanu moved to Moldova with her husband. When war broke out in Ukraine, she invited her old classmate to come to stay with her in Trușeni. Miroshnichenko, along with her best friend from Odesa, Elena Tkach, soon arrived with their daughters, and a house of four people became 10. Munteanu’s daughter, Ioana, had started kickboxing a few months before, and when the trainer at the gym said Ukrainian children could train for free, she invited her new houseguests to join her. The girls took to the sport quickly. “I used to do cheerleading in Ukraine, and I never imagined that I would go to kickboxing,” says 10-year-old Anastasia Miroshnichenko. When Ioana first started kickboxing, she said the other parents in her village did not approve. “They said it’s not a place for girls,” Munteanu says. Now, kickboxing has become a cherished hobby for all three girls, and a distraction for Ksenia and Anastasia, who came from Ukraine. Their trainer translates instructions in the class from Romanian into Russian so they can understand. Munteanu says it was difficult at first to merge three families but now they live as one unit, sharing news and crying together when things get especially tough. “It seems that we are already a team,” she says. The mothers from Ukraine, who came to Moldova without their husbands, say the sport provides an outlet for their daughters during a chaotic time. “Thanks to kickboxing, they don’t think about the fact that they are in a foreign country,” Tkach says. “They are concentrated on new emotions, new feelings, so we are thankful for that.” Rustam says trainers at the kickboxing gym are used to working with children from difficult circumstances since they often work with youth from at-risk communities. He explained the situation of the newcomers to their other students, who quickly accepted them into the group. Rustam says the new students were recognisable just by their uniforms – yellow and blue, like the Ukrainian flag. His colleagues across the border have started holding classes again in some cities but say it is no longer the same because so many children who trained with them have left the country. Moisieva says her children cried frequently at first, pleading to go home. But they have calmed down over time as they settle into a rhythm in Chișinău. “Every day it became easier to accept this situation,” she says. Tymor goes to the kickboxing gym three times a week, where he practises skills such as the splits, back bridges and pushups, as well as sparring. The girls in Trușeni say they are also learning how to defend themselves, which they see as an important skill for women. Ten-year-old Ksenia says the kindness of her Moldovan coaches has made her want to keep fighting. “We would like to continue to do this kind of sport, thanks to the trainers.” ",News/Global development,Kickboxing club in Moldova becomes a refuge for Ukrainian children,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/07/kickboxing-club-in-moldova-becomes-a-refuge-for-ukrainian-children
4/7/2022,"People on Australia’s east coast are finding strange uninvited guests lodged in their carpets and hopping around their homes after record rainfall. The small dull brown creatures are a type of prawn that live on land. They’re known as lawn prawns or forest hoppers, and they’re joining the growing list of critters searching for dry shelter in people’s homes in New South Wales and Queensland where frequent heavy rain has already caused several floods this year. “It’s not very often people see them and that’s why it’s quite surprising for people to find them in their homes,” said Shane Ahyong, a research scientist on marine invertebrates at the Australian Museum. “Usually they’re hidden, unless you’re looking for them you won’t find them.” Queensland resident Anne Carlin was baffled when she found hundreds in her home, posting a photo to Twitter of the “miniature prawn” and asking “Does anyone know what this is”. Does anyone know what this is. That's my index finger. It's about .6 of a centimetre and looks like a miniature prawn. There are hundreds of them on our tiles after a big storm last night. Had happened before pic.twitter.com/jgBIWQ9IbY Another Queensland resident, Helen Bender, told the ABC she first noticed the tiny creatures dead in her home in December. She spent weeks trying to figure out what they were and whether they were a problem. The lawn prawns are harmless and are normally found by the thousands in moist soil beneath leaf litter on Australia’s east coast. But unlike their marine cousins, they can’t breathe underwater. So as the heavy rains swamp their habitat, they’re climbing into people’s homes. Once they are in people’s homes, they eventually die from lack of moisture, turning from brown to pink. While their marine counterparts are a popular dish, the lawn prawns do not compare on taste. “You can eat them if you want,” Ahyong said with a laugh. “But they won’t do much for you, they’re very small. “The key message is don’t see them as a threat, see them as a benefit. Please don’t use pesticides because that will kill them, having a lot of them in your leaf litter is the sign of a healthy system.” There are 30 native species of lawn prawns and these are some of what will be found in back yards. But there are also a number of introduced species that are thought to have been transported here in soil from Sri Lanka or India. “Besides the fact they’re just really cool, it’s good they’re being brought to people’s attention because we don’t often think of crustaceans in our back yard,” Ahyong said. “You think of insects, and you think of bees and birds and lizards. But crustaceans are actually playing a really important role in the ecosystem.” They act as a “recycler”, improving soil by eating decaying leaves and breaking down organic matter. “If you go into the back yard and dig around under mature leaf litter you’ll often see them. To escape predators they hop and bounce around. If you see things jumping around or shuffling quickly in the soil, it’s probably them.” Though it is yet unknown how the lawn prawn populations that live in state forests have been affected by floods, Ahyong said he doesn’t consider the populations of back yard lawn prawns found in homes at risk. But increased warming and flooding resulting from the climate crisis will inevitably have an impact on lawn prawns, he said. “Combine climate change with urbanisation and habitat loss, we are really reducing the number of potential sites that these animals can live in.” “Because they’re hiding in the soil we can destroy swathes of their environment without even knowing it, and that’s bad news for the animals that rely on them for what they do in the soil and rely on them for food.” Heavy rains have also affected the better known marine prawns. The floods have flushed farmed sea prawns out to sea, with one fisher catching an escaped prawn used as breeding stock in the commercial farms that weighed more than 20 times the average king prawn. While fishers are warning prawns will be scarce this season, John Morrongiello, a senior lecturer in marine biology at the University of Melbourne, said the nutrients being flushed into the sea from rivers are spawning fertile breeding grounds that will eventually be a boon for fisheries.",News/Australia news,Invasion of the lawn prawn: heavy rain drives tiny back yard crustaceans into Queensland homes,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/07/invasion-of-the-lawn-prawn-heavy-rain-drives-tiny-back-yard-crustaceans-into-queensland-homes
4/7/2022,"Two senators allege they were treated with “contempt and disrespect” at Western Australia’s Hakea prison when a visit with the superintendent was suddenly cancelled and police were called to remove them from his office. Greens senators Dorinda Cox and Lidia Thorpe – both prominent Aboriginal women – say they had “a meeting booked” to speak with the prison superintendent on Wednesday and were inside the facility before being told it would not take place. “We were standing in the doorway of the superintendent’s office when informed by the superintendent he would no longer meet with us, having been escorted into his office by prison staff with full approval,” Cox, a Yamatji Noongar woman, said on Thursday. But the WA justice department has disputed the senators’ version of events. “There are established protocols for any members of parliament wishing to attend departmental facilities,” a spokesperson said on Wednesday night. “After receiving the request today [on Wednesday] the prison telephoned senator Thorpe’s office advising staff that a meeting couldn’t take place outside of these protocols. “The senators arrived at the prison without the requisite approval. As such, a meeting couldn’t take place and the senators were advised of this. They were asked to leave and they initially refused this request. At no time were the senators detained at the prison.” After leaving, Thorpe said in a Facebook video the pair had earlier on Wednesday “set up a meeting with the superintendent … he agreed to meet with us, we went through the proper process of contacting the secretary … but when we got to the office we were told he didn’t want to meet with us any more”. Cox said the pair had already been ushered into the superintendent’s office before being told the meeting was cancelled. She said they remained in the office “for some hours” and were informed “repeatedly” that someone from senior leadership would meet with them. The senators allege one prison officer in the room filmed Cox with his mobile phone despite her requesting him to stop. They said they were then informed the police had been called to escort them from the prison. Cox – a former WA police officer – said this was an “absolute insult”. “This was a display of contempt and disrespect on part of prison authorities,” the pair said in a joint statement. The senators said they were considering making “a more formal complaint” about their treatment. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Cox and Thorpe said they had “respectfully” sought a meeting at Hakea prison after the death of 22-year-old Noongar man Ricky Lee Cound, who died in mid-March after being found unresponsive in his cell. Cound had been transferred from Acacia prison following a riot. His family has said he spent a significant amount of time in lockdown in the weeks leading up to his death, that he had been self-harming, and had been in need of mental health treatment. At the time, WA’s justice department said the death was not suspicious and police were preparing a report for the coroner. “It’s an embarrassment to the WA government,” Cox said in a Facebook live video filmed at the prison gates on Wednesday. “We have come here in good faith on behalf of the family to ask questions about the death of this young man. It’s unacceptable in 2022 that we – two black female senators – were told to get out of a prison. We’re here trying to … work on the prevention of deaths in custody.”",News/Australia news,Senators allege they were ‘treated with contempt’ when police called to remove them from WA prison,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/07/senators-allege-they-were-treated-with-contempt-when-police-called-to-remove-them-from-wa-prison
4/7/2022,"This week, the government cancelled its first global LGBTQ+ conference which was meant to further equality and help tackle pressing issues like violence and hate. It did this after more than 150 other charities and community organisations from across the LGBTQ+ rights and HIV sector – including Stonewall – withdrew our support for the event. We made this choice because, after years of waiting, the prime minister broke his promise to our community to ban conversion practices for all LGBTQ+ people. In the space of just a few days, official government policy zigzagged: first a weak ban, then no ban, then finally a weak ban that only protects cis lesbian, gay and bi people, leaving transgender people out in the cold. This is in spite of the fact that trans people are one of the groups at highest risk from conversion practices. The UK government’s own research shows that 4% of trans people have been exposed to them. Last week, the LGBTQ+ charity Galop published research on abuse in the home, which found that 11% of trans people have been exposed to conversion practices by their own family. Most of the victims were harmed while they were still children. Conversion practices that target trans people are not new, they are not hidden and they are absolutely not harmless. Abuse of trans people is woven through the whole sorry history of anti-LGBTQ+ conversion efforts. Trans people were being “treated” with electroshock therapy on the NHS well into the 1970s. Today, anti-trans groups talk publicly about having a goal of “100% desistence”; or targeting trans children and young people with conversion practices until no more trans people exist. You can order manuals for conversion practices to use on your trans or gender-questioning child on mainstream websites. The harm done is acute, and sometimes lifelong. Around the world, 14 countries, from Taiwan to Canada, have already banned conversion practices nationwide, and in many others it has been banned at state level. In all but two cases, these bans cover both sexual orientation and gender identity, because all forms of this abuse are unacceptable and harmful, and because all conversion practices targeting LGBTQ+ communities have the same basic motivation. In the words of the UN independent expert: “The injury caused by conversion therapy begins with the notion that an individual is sick, diseased and abnormal due to their sexual orientation or gender identity and must therefore be treated.” An effective, inclusive ban on conversion practices is overwhelmingly supported by the British public. It is supported by the governments of Scotland and Wales, who have been clear that they will legislate and regulate to protect trans people, even if the UK government will not. It is supported by the medical establishment, including the British Psychological Society, British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, Royal College of Psychiatrists, as well as NHS England and Scotland. These professional bodies are signatories to a Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy, and are all actively campaigning for an inclusive and enforceable ban, while working to ensure their members are confident in supporting LGBTQ+ patients ethically and well. It is supported by progressive and inclusive faith leaders. Indeed, this week, in a last-ditch attempt to get the government to see sense, the former archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, along with a number of religious leaders, delivered a letter to Downing Street calling for a trans-inclusive ban and stating that: “To be trans is to enter a sacred journey of becoming whole: precious, honoured and loved, by yourself, by others and by God.” And it is supported by the LGBTQ+ community. We have worked so hard across our movement to get the UK government to see that an effective, inclusive ban on conversion practices is a necessary and straightforward foundation for any country that wants its LGBTQ+ citizens to be able to live their lives freely. They have not listened and LGBTQ+ people will not stay silent. The decision to cancel the conference shows just how seriously the UK government has let down our community – our trust has been shattered. As we approach the 50th anniversary of Pride, it is vital that the prime minister works actively to begin rebuilding trust and set a clear direction for ministers to consistently support all LGBTQ+ people. That must start with a commitment to legislating for a trans-inclusive ban on conversion practices. Trans people are no less worthy of respect, compassion and protection than cis lesbian, gay and bi people. It supports all of our rights, or none of our rights.
