2/10/2022,"A second West Ham sponsor has withdrawn its support for the club as the backlash continued over a video showing the defender Kurt Zouma dropping, kicking and slapping one of his cats. Experience Kissimmee, the tourism authority for Osceola County, Florida, had been evaluating its relationship with West Ham since Zouma was selected to start Tuesday’s game against Watford after the footage went viral.  “Experience Kissimmee announced today that it has ended its sponsorship of West Ham United Football Club,” the club’s destination partner said in a tweet. Its move comes after Vitality, West Ham’s wellness partner, suspended its sponsorship “with immediate effect”, saying it was “hugely disappointed” with the judgment shown by the club in response to the video. West Ham said on Wednesday that they had fined Zouma “the maximum amount possible” – understood to be two weeks’ wages, amounting to £250,000 – and have condemned his behaviour. The RSPCA has taken Zouma’s two cats into care and is conducting an investigation.

2/10/2022,"Alot started to make sense for Peter Keogh in the aftermath of the suicide of his son, Lewis. The 2am requests for an online game of Scrabble, for example, in the months leading up to his death. Lewis, who died in 2013 at the age of 34, was seeking relief from the grip that gambling had on him. “His suicide note said he was too ashamed to talk about it,” says Peter. “We didn’t know he was living with this horrendous addiction.” Starting on Friday, Lewis’s former partner Jane and her daughter Jilly will form part of a 40-strong group walking from Edinburgh to Glasgow. Recovering gambling addicts, bereaved families and affected others will combine. The effort forms part of The Big Step, a campaign aimed at ending all gambling-related advertising and sponsorship in football, overseen by the Gambling With Lives charity. Peter Keogh and his wife, Sadie, are longtime supporters.  “Football clubs have a responsibility to the young people that come and support them,” Peter says. “Every shirt or football element that has a betting logo presents the subconscious to the seven-year-old who loves the game: ‘That must be good if my team is wearing it.’ That’s very dangerous but it is how advertising works. It is subtle but effective.” Lewis’s ashes are scattered under the pitch at Hillsborough. Sheffield Wednesday apologised to his parents after gambling-related branding later appeared at the stadium. “If you go out and look, hard work will get you your [alternative] advertising,” Peter says. Scotland is significant because its two biggest clubs, Celtic and Rangers, have the names of gambling firms across the front of their strips. The Scottish Professional Football League, Scottish Cup and League Cup no longer have bookmakers as title sponsors but until recently all did. “Gambling has always been a big financial contribution to the finances of football,” said Neil Doncaster, the SPFL’s chief executive, last year. Peter Keogh believes politicians are waking up to the fact this alliance is harmful. “It will take parliament to change things but the impetus is in our favour now,” he says in respect of banning gambling sponsorship in football. “If that takes time, it probably takes more lives. The day that we have zero betting advertising in sport will be a great one for me.” The three-day walk will call at the homes of Spartans, Hibs, Hearts, Livingston, Motherwell, Hamilton, Celtic, Partick Thistle and Rangers before concluding at Hampden Park on Sunday evening. Hearts represent an interesting case. “In 2014 we made the decision not to take any direct sponsorship from gambling companies,” says Catriona McCallum, the marketing and communications director. “We, like many clubs, strive to have a positive impact on our community and this was an important step for us. We have been fortunate enough to secure a number of large number of corporate sponsors who are attracted by our social responsibility.” Among those participating is Kelly Field. “I suffered with an online gambling addiction for many years, which was fuelled by a relentless barrage of advertising,” she says. “Gambling advertising and sponsorship, in football and elsewhere, makes people think that gambling is totally normal and safe, when the reality is very different.” Field contemplated suicide. So, too, did James Grimes, who founded The Big Step after a 12-year addiction battle. Although he believes the work of parliaments is important, Grimes feels football supporters can play their own part. “There is a core value in persuading clubs and their fans to get behind this,” he says. “If we can get fans to lobby their clubs – and this happened recently at Norwich City – then we can bring clubs with us. We now have 18 of them who back our campaign. I have no doubt that one day gambling advertising won’t be allowed in football so those clubs are getting ahead of this. We are hoping our presence at the grounds will at least persuade some clubs to rethink their partnerships or pledge to move away from them. “More and more clubs are being more socially conscious. More and more people are seeing the harm caused. Footballers themselves are also in difficulty; the Sporting Chance Clinic said gambling is now the most prominent addiction among footballers. So the clubs know what is happening.” Grimes and Peter Keogh stress that they are “not anti-gambling”; nuance is important. Grimes says: “I genuinely support people’s right to have a bet. We are not trying to stop that. We are on the side of the average gambler. We want gambling to be as safe as it can be. Taking advertisements away from football won’t stop people from having a bet. Thirty years ago, people knew where to go and put a bet on without needing that to be on the front of a football shirt or on LED boards around a pitch.” The Betting and Gaming Council, which represents gambling companies, said the industry had provided vital funding during the pandemic, including £40m to the English Football League, and that a study last year from Prof Ian McHale of the University of Liverpool “concluded there was no evidence that sponsorship of clubs or leagues by betting operators influenced participation in betting”. The BGC added that betting advertising and sponsorship had to comply with strict guidelines and that safer gambling messaging was regularly and prominently displayed. Reports have suggested the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport’s review of the 2005 gambling act could lead to a ban on gambling-related shirt sponsorships from 2023. For now, the battle for the campaigners continues. “I have never thought this is the fault of football,” says Grimes. “It is the fault of regulation, weak regulation which allows gambling companies to exploit loopholes and advertise wherever, whenever, to whomever. Football just laps it up because it is easy. I hope this walk encourages clubs to make the right choice.”  GamCare (gamcare.org.uk, helpline: 0808 8020 133) offers free information, support and counselling for problem gamblers in the UK.

2/10/2022,"It’s the beginning of the end, then, for the two finest fast bowlers England have ever had, the decision to drop them as sudden and unexpected as a bullet in the back. Like they say in the Sopranos: “Our line of work, it’s always out there, you probably don’t even hear it when it happens.” Jimmy Anderson knows it. He wrote as much in his column just a couple of weeks ago: “Everyone’s future is in doubt, it always happens when you get beaten in Ashes.” But it’s one thing to say it, another to really believe it’s true and might be about to happen to you. He also said Joe Root had only just told him he wanted him to stay on. And he would have too, through the West Indies tour, into the English summer and beyond.  If you were picking a side to win England’s next game, Anderson and Broad would be in it. There’s no argument in the statistics. Anderson has taken 56 wickets at 24 runs each in the past two years of Test cricket, Broad 52 at 21. No one else has managed more than 40. You might highlight Anderson’s growing problem with taking wickets in the second innings, but he is still a fitter bowler than Ollie Robinson, who in Australia struggled to make it through his third and fourth spells, let alone the third and fourth days. You might mention Broad’s long lean stretch on tour in Sri Lanka and India last spring, but he’s still a better Test bowler in the conditions than Chris Woakes. But of course those aren’t the numbers that matter. Anderson will hate it, given he’s been complaining for years that older players are held to a different standards, but the figures behind this decision are their ages – 35 and 39 – and the sense that England’s new interim management team, who have now sacked or dropped 11 players and coaches in a week (it’s ended up a very red and bloody “red-ball reset”), feel this is the best way to begin a new era. It can be a fine line between bravery and stupidity. Whether the management are seen to have crossed it or not will depend on how the team does in the West Indies, where they haven’t won a series in 18 years. It leaves Root, in particular, under real pressure to justify the decision to keep him on as captain even after his teams have twice been beaten out of sight in Australia. No one involved is about to discuss it in public now, but there were clear signs of friction between him and his two senior bowlers during the Ashes. He criticised his attack for not being “braver” and for bowling the wrong lengths after they were beaten in Adelaide. Anderson’s pointed public reply was: “We can’t just go after the game, ‘we should have bowled fuller’,” while Broad delivered more blunt truths later in the tour. “It doesn’t matter which bowlers you play if you’re being bowled out for 140,” he said. Broad spoke so well in that press conference that people started talking about whether he might be England’s next Test captain. “Instead of looking ahead at what’s coming next year, what’s coming in the winter, what’s coming in the next Ashes series, can we get back to the real basics of what’s ahead of us right now? How are we winning this next Test?” he said. England have ended up taking the opposite tack. Root, Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood have decided it will be easier to start rebuilding the team, and remodelling England’s approach to Test cricket, without Anderson and Broad. Strauss says it is only for the “time being”. He made it clear that whoever takes over as England’s managing director and head coach would have the choice of picking them again. He’ll know, too, that it won’t necessarily work out that way. It will depend on results in the West Indies and whether Anderson and Broad want to knuckle down to two months of county cricket to try to prove they deserve their spots in the Test squad – spots which, they’ll feel, shouldn’t have been taken away from them to begin with. The anger they feel in the days after the decision will have to drive them through the cold weeks of the Championship, which will feel a little different when Test selection is not taken as given at the end of them. The best, most charitable take on all this is the one Strauss offered himself. It means the new coach will have more options when they take over. They’ll know what they can expect from Broad and Anderson, after all, and have an idea if Matthew Fisher, Craig Overton and Saqib Mahmood are genuine contenders in Test cricket, and whether Robinson, Woakes and Mark Wood are able to lead the attack. But the flip side of it, which Strauss didn’t mention, is that the coach will also be in the invidious position of beginning with a difficult decision about whether or not to take a step backwards, and a righteous clamour to recall Anderson and Broad for at least one more series as a send-off in recognition of everything they’ve done for English cricket. Because it can’t and shouldn’t end like this, with a press release in the dead of winter.",Sport/Sport,"Whatever happens next, Anderson and Broad deserved a better ending than this | Andy Bull",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/10/whatever-happens-next-jimmy-anderson-and-stuart-broad-deserved-a-better-ending-than-this
2/10/2022,"For those versed in trade union folklore, the battle of Saltley Gate holds a special place. In 1972, workers from Birmingham factories downed tools to support striking miners, blockading a gasworks in the city where there was a huge stockpile of coking coal. Orchestrated by a young Arthur Scargill, the blockade successfully prevented lorries from collecting the coal. The action was pivotal in winning the strike for the miners, so it comes as no surprise that today, on the 50th anniversary of Saltley Gate, the Midlands branch of the TUC is holding a celebratory event. Scargill will be one of the speakers.  There is much talk about how Britain is returning to the 1970s, but the detour down memory lane provided by the events in Birmingham in February 1972 shows how fatuous are the comparisons. To be sure, there is some upward pressure on pay as businesses reopen after lockdown, but the idea that Britain is locked into a wage-price spiral is for the birds. Fundamental changes to the economy that have taken place over the past half century mean prices are going to rise faster than wages this year, further eroding living standards. The factories workers surged out of to support Scargill’s call for solidarity have largely gone – since replaced by offices, call centres and warehouses. Mass pickets were outlawed as part of a concerted drive by the Conservative governments of the 1980s to weaken organised labour. The number of workers covered by collective bargaining agreements has plummeted, and in the private sector only one in seven workers belong to a trade union. Four million of the 6.6m trade union members work in the public sector, while those in the lowest-paid, highly casualised sectors, who would benefit most from the support of a trade union, are least likely to be members of one. Just how far the pendulum has swung in the past half century was illustrated in the letter by the general secretary of the GMB union, Gary Smith, to Andrew Bailey, inviting the governor of the Bank of England to try his hand as a care worker for a day to see how people coped on low pay. Bailey has taken some deserved flak for suggesting it would help the Bank of England regain control of inflation were workers – faced with rocketing energy bills and rising taxes – to moderate their wage claims this year The alacrity with which 10 Downing Street slapped down Bailey for his comments was also illustrative. The balance of power in the workplace has shifted too far in favour of employers – and even the Conservatives can sense there is a problem, not least for their own political survival. One thing that has not changed from the 1970s is that making people worse off has a political cost for the government. In theory, weakening the power of unions was supposed to liberate management to bring in new ways of working that would boost efficiency. Forcing workers to accept less generous pay awards would leave more money to spare for investment in new kit and better training. Everybody would be better off. In practice, investment has remained weak. Rather than spend money on improving skills that are lamentably poor by international standards, employers have paid themselves more and boosted the value of their assets through share buyback schemes. The 2010s were a lost decade of historically weak productivity growth and flatlining living standards. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, was quite right when she said the Conservatives had become the party of high taxation because they were the party of low growth. The current model simply isn’t working. There are lessons to be learned from the US, where Joe Biden knows the economic model is not working well enough for ordinary Americans either. Claiming to be the most pro-labour president ever, Biden has tried to make it easier for unions to organise, a move that is showing signs of paying off. Buffalo, in New York state, recently became the first city in the US to have unionised branches of Starbucks, a firm that is certainly no friend of organised labour. Biden has also listened to demands from unions to boost manufacturing through a “buy American” procurement policy. More generally, the White House’s strategy has been to keep the economy running as hot as possible, despite concerns from the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, about inflation. Strong growth has pulled down the unemployment rate, resulting in labour shortages. There have been some positive signs in the UK. The TUC was heavily involved in the design of the furlough scheme at the start of the pandemic. The “national living wage” will go up by 6.6% in April, to £9.50 an hour, shielding those on the lowest incomes from the worst of the cost-of-living crisis. Firms are struggling to fill vacancies, forcing them to offer better pay and conditions. All that said, a piece of the jigsaw is missing, and that is unions. They have a far bigger role to play in prising Britain out of its low-skill, low-pay, low-investment rut. Levelling up is a worthy ambition, but if it is to be anything more than a slogan it needs to begin in the workplace. In recent years, the balance of power between workers and bosses has been a case of levelling down. There’s no question that the UK has plenty of economic woes, but they can’t be blamed on organised labour. One of the problems is that unions are too weak, rather than too strong.

2/10/2022,"Peter Dutton’s incendiary question time intervention suggesting China had picked Anthony Albanese as its election candidate plumbed new – and dangerous – depths. For weeks, Scott Morrison and his defence minister have been suggesting voters must not be lulled into a false sense of national security bipartisanship. Only the Coalition, their argument goes, can be trusted not to “appease” China.  At the tail end of question time on Thursday, Dutton dialled the scare campaign up to 11. With Morrison watching on, the defence minister declared he wanted to scotch the idea that both of Australia’s mainstream political parties were equally committed to “defending our nation”. Nothing, claimed Dutton, could be further from the truth. On matters of national security, he suggested, Albanese was the least-prepared alternative prime minister since Mark Latham. Then came the deadest of dead cats. “We now see evidence, Mr Speaker, that the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, has also made a decision about who they’re going to back in the next federal election Mr Speaker, and that is open and that is obvious, and they have picked this bloke as that candidate,” Dutton said. This was by no means an accidental line. Morrison used similar but vaguer language when stating “those who are seeking to coerce Australia” knew that “their candidate” in the election was “the leader of the Labor party”. The implication of these carefully crafted statements was clear – Labor would go soft on China and had Beijing’s backing. Never mind the fact that Labor has supported the government’s diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics. Never mind that Labor has not only criticised the Chinese government over human rights abuses but has also gone further than the Morrison government by calling for “targeted sanctions on foreign companies, officials and other entities known to be directly profiting from Uyghur forced labour”. Albanese has rebuffed former party elder Paul Keating who wants a return to the engagement policies of the 1990s. In a recent commercial radio interview, when asked whether he stood with Taiwan against the increasing military threat from China, Albanese replied with a crisp: “Yes.” Penny Wong has repudiated the Chinese embassy for putting out a personalised statement criticising Tony Abbott over his high-profile trip to Taiwan. Labor shares the government’s concerns about China’s militarisation of the South China Sea. The ALP backed the government’s defence strategic update in 2020, together with its $270bn in additional spending on defence capability over a decade, and has said it supports the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine plan despite a bunch of questions about how exactly it will be delivered. All of that was cast aside on Thursday for a crude political attack designed to suggest Albanese was Beijing’s favoured candidate (so don’t vote for him). Dutton and Morrison also ignored the director-general of the Office of National Intelligence, Andrew Shearer, whose appointment was originally opposed by Labor because it argued he was from the conservative side of politics. Shearer has said national security “is rightly bipartisan in a more partisan world” and his dealings with Albanese and senior Labor colleagues during private security briefings have been “cordial, constructive and professional”. When Labor’s parliamentary tactician, Tony Burke, rose to complain that Dutton was alluding to treason or sedition on the part of the opposition leader, the minister tried to claim he wasn’t actually tarring Albanese. Dutton stated he was reflecting only “on the actions of the Chinese government” even if that “might be uncomfortable for those opposite”. And then Dutton dropped the head of Asio, Mike Burgess, into the domestic political fray. “Mine was a reflection on what has been publicly reported and commented on by the director-general of Asio and … there are media reports today in relation to these serious matters,” he said. That was an apparent reference to Burgess’s annual threat assessment speech on Wednesday night in which the intelligence boss said Asio had “recently detected and disrupted a foreign interference plot in the lead-up to an election in Australia”. It’s important to note that Burgess was vague on the particular election, country or personalities involved – but went out of his way to say it should be taken as a general warning for all politicians and prospective candidates to be on guard for suspicious approaches. “Attempts at political interference are not confined to one side of politics, and you’d be surprised by the range of countries involved,” he said. Burgess made it clear in an interview a year ago that he did not want Asio to be drawn into domestic political debate and revealed he sometimes had a quiet word telling politicians to cease and desist. That makes Dutton’s invocation of Asio particularly egregious. Some might suggest Thursday’s theatre was aimed at diverting attention from the government’s political problems: the aged care crisis, internal leaks and spats, pandemic missteps and its tone-deaf response to calls for reform by Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins. So why not ignore it? Because prioritising politics over national security in this way is dangerous and must be called out. The Dutton intervention undermines institutional structures and conventions. It drew in the Asio chief – someone who is meant to be an apolitical security official – as collateral damage. Burgess himself noted on Wednesday that the alleged election plot had been thwarted, the prospective candidates had been unaware of it, and Australia must not allow the fear of foreign interference to “stoke community division”. That would, he said, “perversely have the same corrosive impact on our democracy as foreign interference itself”. Dutton’s intervention is also damaging because it attempts to maximise domestic division at a time of intense global challenges and when unity should be an asset. Dutton’s own cabinet colleague, Dan Tehan, observed four months ago that there was now “bipartisan recognition of the changing geostrategic environment in the Indo-Pacific and the greater assertiveness that we’re seeing from China”. In a plea to stay united on defence, foreign affairs, intelligence and trade issues, Tehan said: “The more that we can make sure that we’re united politically in how we tackle these current strategic issues I think the better it is for us as a nation.” But that unity is now being trashed for crude political reasons – an election is looming.",News/Australia news,Peter Dutton has plumbed new and dangerous depths by suggesting China is backing Labor | Daniel Hurst,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/peter-dutton-has-plumbed-new-and-dangerous-depths-by-suggesting-china-is-backing-labor
2/10/2022,"Lan Samantha Chang’s third novel begins by bringing history to the table: “For thirty-five years, everyone supported Leo Chao’s restaurant.” The Wisconsin eatery is a family affair. Everyone assumes it will eventually be peacefully handed down to one of Leo’s three sons – but they overlook just how fraught and bloody inheritance can be. “In dark times,” Chang writes, with a characteristically cunning sense of slow-boiled foreboding, “there is really nothing like a good, steaming soup, and dumplings made from scratch.”  The Family Chao was not quite made from scratch. Some of the dough that forms its schemes and themes comes from The Brothers Karamazov. In fact, Chang’s story at first brings to mind another Dostoevsky-influenced state-of-America novel: Jonathan Franzen’s The Corrections. In both books, the reader meets three adult siblings coming home for a family Christmas as the patriarch loses his grip on power. But where The Corrections sprawled and swelled, The Family Chao has a laser focus: one restaurant, one town, and one crime that will transform the family’s fortunes. As with Zadie Smith’s On Beauty, a novel that took its blueprint from Howards End, you get the sense that borrowing the bones of a classic has freed up the author to focus on making every interior detail as perfect as it can be. One of the many pleasures of The Family Chao is the way the novel dramatises the gap between how a family wants to be seen, and its messier inner realities. The neon sign that greets new arrivals at the restaurant is “FINE CHAO”. (If the head of the family would only relax his grip on singularity, the place might be rebranded more appropriately as “FINE CHAOS”.) Inside, beyond the “small, shabby dining room”, we find a bulletin board covered with chaotic scraps of paper. The increasingly absent matriarch of the family, Winnie, has pinned up a list of foods that American customers prefer to be served. One is chop suey. “What is this?” her husband has written in the margin. “I don’t know,” Winnie replies. Amid a drama of family betrayal, Chang has created a wonderful comedy of American consumption. To quote a heading from one of the many short sections that make up the book, like small plates slowly filling our table: “The Fortune You Seek Is in Another Cookie.” Chang’s prose moves with the unfussy ease of a shark through water – for the longest time you are just enjoying your swim, soaking up the story. Only midway through the book does it occur to you that a master hunter is at work: a writer cutting through the darker depths of what it means to be treated as an outsider in America. At the novel’s halfway point we are confronted with the words “THREE MONTHS LATER”. The central events on which the plot turns have taken place off stage, in an unlit space. Chang is more interested in consequences, and she has great fun unpicking the slightly breathless trial that occupies the final third of the book. One late chapter on the fate of the family is written as a student blog for a course on Writing for New Media. Chang, who is the programme director at the Iowa Writer’s Workshop, starts out with the student’s bullet-pointed “personal goals”. These include “Use bullet points when possible”. If the writer’s greatest fear is being misunderstood, the restaurateur’s true terror may be getting locked in the freezer room. That is just one culinary nightmare (I won’t spoil your meal) that creates this book’s atmosphere of laughter in the dark. Meat is everywhere in the novel: fresh, rotting, chopped, fried – and thrown, in one memorable scene, to a pack of dogs. Like crazed siblings, the animals fight over the scraps, unaware that the next meal might be them. In the background, a group of nuns protest. But the soul is no match for the stomach. “Do you think I want this dog’s life?” Leo Chao asks one of his sons in a key moment. A man of presence, impatience and profanity, he believes in doing whatever American appetites require. Like a small-town version of Logan Roy, the patriarch in another drama about siblings squabbling over succession, Leo has “the authority of a man larger than he actually is”. He tells his most innocent son, a soulful virgin pre-med named James, that “we came to America to colonise the place for ourselves. That means spreading seed. Equal opportunity for fucking.” But however appalled the sons might be by their father’s perspectives, they continue to absorb elements of his character. You are what you eat, the novel seems to suggest. And you eat what your family, or your country, puts on the table. “As far as parties are concerned,” Chang’s omniscient narrator tell us, “there are many ways to greatness. There’s greatness of style, of setting, of occasion, and of company.” The Family Chao has a little of all these ingredients – but even better, it arrives with something to say.
