2/17/2022,"The number of British 18-year-olds aiming to go to university directly from school continues to increase at a record pace, according to figures that show a surge in applications this year. The number of school-leavers applying for undergraduate courses starting in September increased by another 5% at the initial January deadline, faster than the age group’s demographic growth and after two successive years of steep rises in applications.  According to the Ucas university admissions service, 320,000 sixth formers have applied for university places so far, compared with 306,000 in 2021 and almost 50,000 more than at the same stage in 2019. The latest figures cap a decade-long increase in the proportion of school-leavers opting for higher education. In England alone, 44% of all 18-year-olds applied in January, the highest on record. Ten years previously, in 2013, just 33% did so. There were also record rates of applications among students in Wales and Northern Ireland, while those in Scotland were second only to the rate recorded last year. The number of applicants from disadvantaged areas has also continued to rise, with 28% of 18-year-olds from areas with the lowest educational attainment applying, compared with just under 18% in 2013. Clare Marchant, Ucas chief executive, said universities had made greater use of online recruitment events such as virtual open days, as well as advertising courses on social media, during the Covid pandemic. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents most secondary schools, said the rise in applications from disadvantaged areas was a testament to the hard work of teachers during the pandemic. “However, it needs to be remembered that far fewer disadvantaged young people enter higher education than their more advantaged peers, and that this gap is particularly stark at the most selective universities,” Barton said. Applications by international students through Ucas remained flat, thanks to a continued fall in the number of students from the EU applying. Since the UK’s formal exit, students from the EU face paying higher fees, and their numbers have slumped from nearly 17,000 applicants in 2019 to 10,000 this year. However, stronger growth among non-EU applicants has led to nearly 43,000 applications. 12% more students from China applied for courses, making a total of 14,500, and another 3,000 from Hong Kong. Last year also saw a sharp increase in the number of mature students aged over 21 applying for first degree courses. But as fears around the post-pandemic labour market receded, applications have fallen this year by 17%. The increased application rate among sixth formers in England suggests that the appetite for higher education remains undimmed, despite the government’s efforts to talk up the benefits of alternatives such as apprenticeships or other training. Michelle Donelan, the universities minister for England, said in a speech that, from next year, universities would be asked to include credit card-style smallprint on advertising for courses, including how many students go on to graduate-level jobs. “Just like a credit card advertisement including information about APR, university adverts will reflect the need for students to understand where a course can take them,” Donelan said. Donelan also announced that Ucas was to reform the use of personal statements by students as part of their university applications, amid concerns that the statements favoured more advantaged students.",News/Education,"Rise in university applications from UK 18-year-olds, figures show",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/17/rise-in-university-applications-from-uk-18-year-olds-figures-show
2/17/2022,"Repeated heading and accidental head impacts in football cause changes to blood patterns in the brain, potentially interfering with signalling pathways, according to a study of players in Norway. The peer-reviewed research, published in the Brain Injury journal, is the latest item in a growing body of evidence pointing to the dangers of heading. It discovered “specific alterations” in levels of microRNAs in the brain upon analysing blood samples from 89 professional players in the country’s top flight.  MicroRNAs are molecules that help to regulate gene expression, through which DNA instructions are converted into products such as proteins, in bodily fluids. The findings suggest that, given the change in levels, they may be able to be used as biomarkers to detect brain injury. Blood samples were taken from players after accidental head impacts in matches and after specifically designed training sessions. Forty-eight of the players, drawn from three teams, took part in a session that included repetitive heading drills from set pieces and similar scenarios; they also undertook one that involved other high-intensity exercise, with no head contact allowed. The results found specific changes in certain microRNA levels whose numbers were unaffected by the other high-intensity exercise. Accidental head injuries were found to alter the levels of eight microRNAs that high-intensity exercise did not affect, and repetitive headers were found to change six. The upshot is that, as well as potentially detecting brain injury, microRNAs may also be able to differentiate injury severity. Stian Bahr Sandmo of the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Centre at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, which led the study, said: “This is a relatively small sample-size exploratory study but future findings expanding upon our research could ultimately lead to an improved understanding of the potential hazardous effects of repetitive head impacts.” The risks involved with heading have become a major talking point in football. New guidance was issued in July to limit players in the Premier League and Football League to 10 “higher force” headers in training sessions, although there is doubt over whether those guidelines are being followed and Nuno Espírito Santo publicly admitted ignoring them during his short time as Tottenham manager. Concussion substitutes have also been trialled in English football, allowing two replacements for players who have sustained head injuries.",Sport/Football,Heading football and head impacts ‘change blood patterns in brain’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/17/heading-football-and-head-impacts-change-blood-patterns-in-brain
2/17/2022,"New guidance on political impartiality in the classroom is confusing and likely to scare teachers in England away from tackling important subjects such as climate change and racism, according to education unions. The guidance issued by the Department for Education says that recent historical events “which are particularly contentious and disputed”, such as “many topics relating to empire and imperialism”, should be taught “in a balanced manner”.  The DfE’s guidance singles out the Black Lives Matter movement, saying that while teachers should be clear “that racism has no place in our society”, the demands of campaigning organisations such as BLM “go beyond the basic shared principle that racism is unacceptable”. In teaching of scientific facts around climate change, teachers are told they should not provide balance in the form of misinformation or unsubstantiated claims. However, the guidance goes on to state that “where teaching covers the potential solutions for tackling climate change, this may constitute a political issue”. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, said: “I don’t want there to be any barriers – real or perceived – to teachers’ vital work in this space, which is why I am reinforcing that no subject is off-limits in the classroom, as long as it is treated in an age-appropriate way, with sensitivity and respect, and without promoting contested theories as fact.” But Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said that the guidance “does not so much clarify existing guidance as add new layers of mystification and complexity to it” for teachers and school leaders. “This could induce such a level of uncertainty and caution in schools about ‘political issues’ that they are less likely to engage with them,” Bousted said. “The losers in the DfE’s 34-page game of obfuscation about what is and is not a ‘political’ issue will be the students who are denied the opportunity to engage with the most challenging issues of our time. “The warning lights that the government is flashing around climate change, racism, world poverty and the legacy of empire as topics of exploration are more likely to decrease students’ engagement with learning than to stimulate it.” The guidance – which contains no new statutory requirements and is based on existing legal duties – avoids defining “political issues”, stating that ethical debates are not political issues if they are “shared principles that underpin our society”, such as freedom of speech or challenging racism. Instead, school leaders and teachers are told to use “reasonable judgment to determine what is and is not a ‘political issue’”. The guidance also warns against reliance on teaching material provided by external agencies. In one scenario of teaching about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the document says teachers need to ensure that any external resources used are impartial. When teaching younger pupils about “significant” political figures, “including those who have controversial and contested legacies”, schools are advised “to focus on teaching about what these figures are most renowned for and factual information about them if teachers think pupils may not be able to understand the contested nature of more complex analyses of their lives, beliefs and actions”. More complex discussions about controversial figures “might be reserved for older pupils who are more likely to be able to understand and engage in this debate”. The Association of School and College Leaders said it would be “studying the guidance carefully to understand its implications”. “The vast majority of teachers are very good at managing these discussions in a way that is balanced and impartial. We welcome anything which helps them to navigate this difficult territory. However, we are keen that this should not be over-prescriptive as it could have the unintended consequence of deterring open discussions,” the ASCL said.",News/Education,Guidance on political impartiality in English classrooms ‘confusing’ say teachers’ unions,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/17/guidance-on-political-impartiality-in-english-classrooms-confusing-say-teachers-unions
2/17/2022,"The Post Office and the government need to speed upcompensation payments to workers who were victims of the Horizon IT scandal, according to a report by an influential group of MPs. MPs from parliament’s Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) committee have expressed concerns about the time taken to make settlements to former Post Office operators who were wrongfully convicted as a result of errors in the company’s computer accounting system.  They have warned that compensation needs to be concluded urgently, as many of the former Post Office workers affected by the long-running scandal are elderly, some have already died while awaiting redress, while others remain at risk of losing their homes. The committee began holding hearings in 2020 about the Horizon IT scandal, one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history, and has now published an interim report. The committee has paused its hearings as the public inquiry into the scandal has got under way. In recent days, the inquiry has heard the moving testimony of people prosecuted by the Post Office about the impact of their wrongful convictions on their lives, and the resulting financial hardship. The public inquiry, chaired by the retired high court judge Sir Wyn Williams, is part of an investigation into the scandal. Between 2000 and 2014, the Post Office prosecuted 736 post office operators – an average of one a week – based on information from the Horizon IT system, which was installed and maintained by Fujitsu. A group of 555 former workers won a high court battle against the Post Office in December 2019, when a high court judge ruled that Horizon’s system contained a number of “bugs, errors and defects” and there was a “material risk” that shortfalls in Post Office branch accounts were caused by the system. Dozens of former Post Office workers have since had their convictions for theft, fraud and false accounting quashed by the court of appeal. Some of the convicted workers were sent to prison, others lost their livelihoods and their homes. Many went bankrupt, and some died before their names were cleared. The group of 555 who brought the legal action were awarded £57.75m, but the vast majority (£46m) was swallowed up in legal costs, leaving only about £20,000 in compensation for each person, which MPs said the victims view as “inadequate”. At the time of the high court verdict, the government decided this group could not apply for compensation through another scheme, known as the historical shortfall scheme (HSS). Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05-61553-gnl.fw.200505.jf.ch7DW.mp3 The MPs condemned how this had led to the “perverse situation” that workers who were part of the legal action faced receiving less compensation than others. “It is clearly entirely unacceptable that the group of 555 victims who first brought this scandal successfully to court are being left in a worse position than those who are being compensated thanks to their action,” said Darren Jones, chair of the committee. “There is no valid reason to exclude the 555 from being fully compensated and the chancellor must come forward with the required funding now.” The MPs expressed concern that over 570 sub-postmasters who were wrongly convicted as a result of Horizon have not yet come forward to begin the process of overturning their convictions, despite attempts by the Post Office to contact them. They are calling on the government to create an independent body to serve as a “trusted first point of contact” for those who were wrongly convicted. The Post Office has previously said it cannot afford to foot the huge clean-up bill for the scandal and the government, the service’s only shareholder, has confirmed the taxpayer would step in.",News/Business,"Falsely convicted postal workers must be ‘fully compensated’, says committee",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/17/falsely-convicted-postal-workers-must-be-fully-compensated-says-committee
2/17/2022,"The world is spending at least $1.8tn (£1.3tn) every year on subsidies driving the annihilation of wildlife and a rise in global heating, according to a new study, prompting warnings that humanity is financing its own extinction. From tax breaks for beef production in the Amazon to financial support for unsustainable groundwater pumping in the Middle East, billions of pounds of government spending and other subsidies are harming the environment, says the first cross-sector assessment for more than a decade.  This government support, equivalent to 2% of global GDP, is directly working against the goals of the Paris agreement and draft targets on reversing biodiversity loss, the research on explicit subsidies found, effectively financing water pollution, land subsidence and deforestation with state money. The authors, who are leading subsidies experts, say a significant portion of the $1.8tn could be repurposed to support policies that are beneficial for nature and a transition to net zero, amid growing political division about the cost of decarbonising the global economy. The report calls for governments to agree a target to eradicate environmentally harmful subsidies by the end of the decade at the biodiversity Cop15 gathering in China later this year, where it is hoped a “Paris agreement for nature” will be signed, and for companies to reveal the subsidies they receive as part of environmental disclosure reporting. Christiana Figueres, who was head of the UN climate change convention when the Paris agreement was signed, welcomed the research. She said the subsidies were creating huge risks for the businesses receiving them. “Nature is declining at an alarming rate, and we have never lived on a planet with so little biodiversity,” she said. “Harmful subsidies must be redirected towards protecting the climate and nature, rather than financing our own extinction.” The fossil fuel industry ($620bn), the agricultural sector ($520bn), water ($320bn) and forestry ($155bn) account for the majority of the $1.8tn, according to the report. No estimate for mining, believed to cause billions of dollars of damage to ecosystems every year, could be derived. Lack of transparency between governments and recipients means the true figure is likely to be much higher, as is the implicit cost of harmful subsidies. Last year, an International Monetary Fund report found the fossil fuel industry benefited from subsidies worth $5.9tn in 2020, but the vast majority of this figure comes from the hidden costs of failing to make polluters pay for the deaths they cause and global heating. “Subsidy reform allows us to improve the price signals so that we are not protecting income in more polluting industries,” said Doug Koplow, founder of the organisation Earth Track, which monitors environmentally harmful subsidies, and co-author of the report, along with Ronald Steenblik, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s former special counsellor for fossil fuel subsidy reform. “It creates space for alternative and cleaner forms of energy to enter the marketplace.” A draft target in the UN biodiversity agreement for this decade calls for $500bn a year in subsidies to be reformed, but The B Team and Business for Nature, which supported the research, have said this must be strengthened. The world has never met a target on halting biodiversity loss, and the failure to act on subsidies was highlighted as a major issue from last decade’s targets. Eva Zabey, executive director of Business for Nature, said businesses were often unaware of the extent of explicit and implicit subsidies they benefit from, but could use their influence to call for change. “Many businesses are benefiting from these environmentally harmful subsidies. This cannot be a taboo topic. We need to speak using facts and understand where the financial flows are going,” she said. “Typically, the subsidies were established with good intentions in mind. We need to level the playing field because right now, some are benefiting from a head start when it should be the other way round. It’s a wicked problem.” Last year, a UN report found almost 90% of subsidies given to farmers every year are harmful, damaging people’s health, fuelling the climate crisis, destroying nature and driving inequality by excluding smallholder farmers. Elizabeth Mrema, the UN’s biodiversity head, said the report was critically important. “The report highlights how redirecting, repurposing, or eliminating subsidies could make an important contribution to unlocking the $711bn required each year to halt and reverse the loss of nature by 2030 as well as the cost of reaching net zero emissions,” she said.

2/17/2022,"Jürgen Klopp had seen enough. With almost an hour played at San Siro, Internazionale cutting his team to ribbons and the home crowd buoyant, the Liverpool manager retreated to his bench in dim spirits. There were a few seconds of discussion with his coaches. Training tops were peeled off, tactical instructions issued, last-minute warm-ups executed. And then, the flourish: a triple substitution in the 59th minute. Off came Sadio Mané, Fabinho and Harvey Elliott. Diogo Jota had already gone off injured at half‑time. It was Klopp’s inimitable way of telling his players that he wasn’t angry, just disappointed.  Jordan Henderson bounded on to the pitch clapping furiously, captain’s armband stretched over his biceps, with all the coiled energy of the five-a-side player who’s come straight from the office and had to run the last half-mile from the bus stop. Luis Díaz trotted on and immediately looked threatening. Naby Keïta grappled, pressed, plugged gaps. In the space of a few minutes Klopp had entirely transformed the feel of his Liverpool side: more grizzled, more skittish. The simple conclusion to draw would be that Klopp’s substitutions won a game that was drifting away from Liverpool. In reality, it was a little more subtle than that. The bold and brave Inter continued to create plenty of problems for a good while afterwards. Roberto Firmino’s opening goal on 75 minutes – a classic near-post flicked header – might just as easily have been scored by Jota as well. And for all the changes in midfield and attack, it was really in defence – where Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté were superb – that this game was won and lost. The first 70 minutes had been almost unbearably taut, a thrilling arm-wrestle between two teams with remarkably similar league records this season: second place with 54 points from 24 games. And for all the portents of an easy night for Liverpool – you have to assume Simone Inzaghi knew exactly what he was doing when he said Liverpool were the team he wanted to avoid – Inter had come to eat. They hunted down Liverpool’s back four and forced them to cough up possession time and again, enjoying two clear chances through the superb Hakan Calhanoglu and Lautaro Martínez. San Siro was shrouded in mist and flags on a chilly night, giving the whole game a heraldic, folkloric quality. There were brilliant duels taking place all over the pitch: Trent Alexander-Arnold against Ivan Perisic; Alessandro Bastoni against Mo Salah; Edin Dzeko against Van Dijk, the sort of tussle that gets dads of a certain age all misty-eyed and reminiscent about “when men were men”. Arturo Vidal, meanwhile, was taking on anyone he could find: roaming all over midfield, getting into scraps, haranguing the Polish referee, still the unruliest 34‑year‑old teenager in world football. There were plenty of brief little panics but not much in the way of clear chances or notable needle. Part of the problem was that for all their bravery on the ball, Inter lacked the real pace to trouble Liverpool on the counter-attack. Martínez made plenty of clever peeling runs into the channel, and Calhanoglu was a wonderful creative force in midfield, but too often the final pass, the decisive run, the little touch of quality was missing. For all the noise and fury, seasoned Liverpool watchers will tell you that when you have them on the ropes, you really need to make them suffer. Because of what they can do next. This, then, was the real value of Klopp’s triple substitution: it was a show of strength, forcing Inter to combat new angles and new tactics just as the relentless physicality of the game was beginning to tell on an aging team. In a way, it was Klopp toying with Inzaghi. Here, try our new £50m winger. Here, try a Champions League-winning captain. Here, try the £60m midfielder we can afford to keep on the bench. Who have you got? Matteo Darmian? Oh. Oh dear. Factor in the players who didn’t even make it on to the pitch here – Joël Matip, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Takumi Minamino – and you can see why Liverpool fans are getting increasingly excited about the squad they have assembled. It used to be the case that once you got past Liverpool’s first XI the drop in quality was stark. Now they have enviable depth, competition for places, a bench that feels like a genuine weapon. Nowhere was this more evident than here, when the game was open and Inter were rampant and then all of a sudden were 2-0 down. How to snuff out a Champions League tie in eight minutes. Naturally Inter will have a good go at Anfield next month, and there was more than enough here to commend Inzaghi’s work this season. But in hindsight the even contest that existed here for 75 minutes was little more than a chimera, an illusion of parity that eventually shook out exactly as we had all predicted. In front of a fervid home crowd, Inter threw their very best at a sub-par opponent. It still wasn’t remotely enough.",Sport/Football,Klopp flexes Liverpool’s strength in depth to devour ageing Inter | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/16/klopp-flexes-liverpools-strength-in-depth-to-devour-aging-inter
2/17/2022,"A simple test could end years of uncertainty for people with relatively common neurological conditions, new research has found. Historically, obtaining a definitive diagnosis for conditions including Huntingdon’s disease and some forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been difficult, because, although the cause of the symptoms is genetic, knowing which test to carry out has resulted in delays of many years.  Now, a new study suggests that whole genome sequencing (WGS) can quickly and accurately detect the most common inherited neurological disorders, and could be implemented in routine clinical practice with immediate effect. “It is very exciting because it opens up the vista of a test that could end the diagnostic odyssey for many patients,” said Prof Sir Mark Caulfield from Queen Mary University of London and former chief scientist at Genomics England. “This work paves the way for this to be implemented immediately within the NHS.” WGS is already offered to people in England with rare disorders or childhood cancers through the NHS Genomic Medicine Service. However, the technique wasn’t thought to work on people with ‘repeat expansion disorders’ caused by the insertion of short repetitive chunks of DNA into the genetic code – in some cases, stretching across long distances – because they can be difficult to quantify. Such disorders are relatively common, affecting around one in 3,000 people, and include neurodegenerative and movement disorders such as Fragile X syndrome, Huntington’s disease, Friedreich’s ataxia, and some forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or frontal lobe dementia. Instead, those with neurological symptoms are subjected to multiple tests, each examining a single gene at a time, and taking six to eight weeks to return a result – meaning a long diagnostic odyssey for many patients. For those with atypical clinical presentations, especially children without a previous positive family history, the process can take years. Prof Patrick Chinnery, clinical director at the Medical Research Council, said: “Many patients with neurological disorders never receive a precise diagnosis. This new study shows how whole genome sequencing can address this challenge through a genuinely national programme, taking world-leading research to patients across the whole of England and improving their health care.” The new test utilises an algorithm that can spot repetitive elements in whole genome sequences, by comparing those from healthy people with those affected by repeat expansion disorders. “The advantage is that you can test multiple variants at the same time,” said Dr Arianna Tucci at Queen Mary University of London, who led the research. The study, published in The Lancet Neurology, assessed the accuracy of WGS to detect repeat expansion disorders in 404 patients who had previously been diagnosed using standard NHS tests, concluding that the accuracy and sensitivity of WGS was comparable. Next, it was used to investigate 11,631 undiagnosed people with clinical symptoms potentially associated with a repeat expansion disorder, resulting in a new diagnosis for 68 of them. Among those who benefited were six children, some of whom had no reported family history and are likely to have remained undiagnosed – including a 10-year-old girl with an intellectual disability and an 18-year-old teenager with dementia. “Here in a single test, we have the capacity to diagnose the most common neurological diseases,” said Caulfield. Another of those who benefited is Eileen Flynn, a patient at The Ataxia Centre at University College London Hospitals who was diagnosed with Friedreich’s ataxia through the study. She said: “Over the last 15 years I’ve gone from someone who was confident, loved to dance and socialise to now using a walker and having slurred speech. “Before my diagnosis, I thought it would be better if I had cancer as there’s usually a clear path of action to help you fight the disease. Having a diagnosis isn’t a cure, but at last I know what is happening and understand what I need to do to delay the inevitable for as long as possible.” A definitive diagnosis also meant other family members could be tested – sadly, this confirmed that her younger sister also has the disorder.",News/Science,"Simple DNA test could detect common neurological disorders, study says",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/16/simple-dna-test-could-detect-common-neurological-disorders-study-says
2/17/2022,"More than one in four women worldwide experience domestic violence before the age of 50, according to the largest review of its kind, prompting calls for urgent action to end the abuse. Analysis of 366 studies involving more than 2 million women reached an estimate that 27% of women aged 15 to 49 have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a male partner in their lifetime. One in seven women (13%) – almost 500 million globally – had experienced domestic violence within the last year of the research being conducted. The findings were published in the Lancet.  Because the studies, conducted between 2000 and 2018, were based on self-reported experiences, and given the sensitive and stigmatised nature of the issue, the true scale of violence is feared to be even higher, the researchers said. The Covid pandemic is likely to have contributed to more cases, they added. “Intimate partner violence affects the lives of millions of women, children, families and societies worldwide,” said the study’s senior author, Claudia García-Moreno, of the World Health Organization (WHO). “Although this study took place before the Covid-19 pandemic, the numbers are alarming and research has shown the pandemic exacerbated issues leading to intimate partner violence such as isolation, depression and anxiety, and alcohol use, as well as reducing access to support services. “Preventing intimate partner violence from happening in the first place is vital and urgent. Governments, societies and communities need to take heed, invest more, and act with urgency to reduce violence against women, including by addressing it in post-Covid reconstruction efforts.” García-Moreno said progress made over the last 20 years was “grossly insufficient” to meet global targets for eliminating violence against women by 2030. The study also found high levels of violence against adolescent girls and young women. In the youngest age cohort, 15 to 19, 24% are estimated to have experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetime. The prevalence of recent intimate partner violence was highest among ever-partnered adolescent girls and young women aged 15 to 19 and 20 to 24, with 16% or one in six having experienced domestic violence within the last 12 months of the research. “The high number of young women experiencing intimate partner violence is alarming, as adolescence and early adulthood are important life stages when the foundations for healthy relationships are built,” said the lead author of the study, LynnMarie Sardinha, also of the WHO. “The violence these young women experience has long-lasting impacts on their health and wellbeing. Intimate partner violence is preventable and more needs to be done to develop and invest in effective community- and school-based interventions that promote gender equality and reduce young women’s risk of being subjected to violence from a partner.” The analysis of data from 161 countries found regional variations, with high-income countries having lower prevalences of both lifetime and past-year violence. The lifetime prevalence among women aged 15 to 49 was highest in Oceania (49%) and central sub-Saharan Africa (44%). The regions with the lowest estimated lifetime domestic violence against women were central Europe (16%) and central Asia (18%). Prevalence in western Europe was estimated at 20%, suggesting one in five women in the region experience domestic violence before the age of 50. The authors acknowledge some limitations with the study. They include important gaps in the data for some geographical regions and specific populations – for example, people living with disabilities, minority ethnic or migrant women, trans women, and women in same-sex partnerships. “These findings confirm that violence against women by male intimate partners remains a global public health challenge,” said García-Moreno, who called for “urgent investment in effective multi-sector interventions and a strengthened public health response in tackling this issue post-Covid”.",News/Society,One in four women experience domestic abuse before 50 – study,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/16/one-in-four-women-experience-domestic-abuse-before-50-study
