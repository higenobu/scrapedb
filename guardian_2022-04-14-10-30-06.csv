4/14/2022,"The Russian defence ministry has said the entire crew of the warship Moskva, reported to be struck by Ukraine in the Black Sea late on Wednesday, has been evacuated after an ammunition explosion resulted in a fire on the ship. “The cruiser Moskva of the Black Sea Fleet was seriously damaged as a result of the detonation of ammunition that occurred as a result of a fire, the crew was evacuated,” Russian state media outlet TASS reported, citing the Russian defence ministry. The ship was defied by Ukrainian troops on Snake Island at the start of the war. A Ukrainian official earlier said the Moskva had been hit by two missiles but did not give any evidence. The 12,500-tonne ship has a crew of about 500. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for an oil embargo in his nightly address on Wednesday. “First of all, we need an oil embargo. And Europe’s clear readiness to give up all Russian energy. The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia’s military machine.” Zelenskiy confirmed forensic experts from the international criminal court visited Bucha on Wednesday to investigate possible war crimes. “Responsibility for the Russian military for war crimes is inevitable. We will drag them all to the tribunal. And not only for what was done in Bucha.” US president Joe Biden announced an additional $800m in military assistance to Ukraine including heavy artillery ahead of a wider Russian assault expected in eastern Ukraine. The package, which brings the total military aid since Russian forces invaded in February to more than $2.5bn, includes artillery systems, artillery rounds, armoured personnel carriers and unmanned coastal defence boats, Biden said in a statement after a phone call with Zelenskiy. The US state department on Wednesday defended Biden’s charge that Russia is carrying out a genocide in Ukraine, saying its forces are trying to destroy the country and its civilian population. Biden levelled the accusation at president Vladimir Putin’s forces for the first time on Tuesday. “I am going to predict that what president Biden called it is what we will ultimately likely find when we are able to gather all of this evidence,” the state department’s number three official, Victoria Nuland, said on CNN. “Because what is happening on the ground is not an accident.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has declined to repeat Biden’s accusation that Russia was carrying out “genocide” against Ukrainians, warning that verbal escalations would not help end the war. The US president said on Tuesday it had “become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being able to be a Ukrainian”. In response, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described Biden’s comments as “unacceptable”. More than 1,000 Ukrainian marines defending the besieged port city of Mariupol have surrendered, Moscow has claimed. In one of the most critical battles of the war, Russia’s defence ministry said on Wednesday that 1,026 soldiers from Ukraine’s 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had “voluntarily laid down their arms” near the city’s Ilyich iron and steelworks. There was no independent confirmation of the claim. The Russian retreat from around Kyiv has led to the discovery of large numbers of apparently massacred civilians, drawing international condemnation and calls for a war crimes investigation. The Kyiv district police chief said the bodies of 765 civilians, including 30 children had been found around the capital. Russian troops are reportedly suffering from “low morale and disenchantment” among some of the younger troops. While speaking at a press conference today, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby also said that Russian troop leaders were “frustrated” as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues. The presidents of four countries bordering Russia – Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia – have travelled to Kyiv in a show of support for their Ukrainian counterpart and his embattled troops. It follows Kyiv’s reported refusal to meet the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who visited Poland on Tuesday and said he had planned to go on to Ukraine but “was not wanted”. The former German foreign minister is facing heavy criticism for his past policy of rapprochement towards Moscow. Zelenskiy told Estonian MPs, without providing evidence, that Russia was using phosphorus bombs in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces in Mariupol said a drone had dropped a poisonous substance on the city, but there has been no independent confirmation that Russia used banned chemical weapons. In a speech at the Atlantic Council on Wednesday, US treasury secretary Janet Yellen said that countries on the fence of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine could face global isolation. “The unified coalition of sanctioning countries will not be indifferent to actions that undermine the sanctions we’ve put in place.” Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said the country would decide on whether to apply for Nato membership “within weeks”. Speaking at a joint news conference with her Swedish counterpart, Marin said that as a Nato partner – but not a member – Finland was not covered under article 5, which states that an attack on one member should be considered an attack on all. The UK government has imposed sanctions on another 206 individuals in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, including 178 people it said were involved in propping up the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said the latest sanctions were imposed in a direct response to the “horrific rocket attacks” on a train station in Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine, that killed dozens of civilians. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said it was not possible to open any humanitarian corridors on Wednesday. She said the situation along the routes was “too dangerous”, and accused Russian forces of violating an agreement to halt shooting while people escape.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 50 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-50-of-the-invasion
4/14/2022,"The cost of renting a house has soared by up to 21.2% in Australia’s capital cities, with further rises expected as the national rental crisis deepens. Over the past 12 months, capital city house rents have recorded price increases of 14.7% while rental units have risen by 11.2%, SQM Research has found. Brisbane has experienced a 15.2% 12-month combined rental increase, with house rents rising the most, up 21.2% compared with this time last year. Adelaide and Canberra are the next worst hit, seeing a combined increase of 14.3%. Rental prices for houses in Sydney have gone up 19.1%, while Melbourne unit rents have jumped by 11.5% in the past 12 months. Lauren Neiland recently decided to move, as she and her partner were expecting their first child and needed to upsize. They were able to break the lease of their Aspley property, north of central Brisbane, without having to pay fees. Neiland was lucky – her partner had just received a pay rise, and after eight rejections, they secured her “perfect home”. After moving out, the price of their former rental rose sharply from $420 to $525 a week. “We kept an eye on the listing out of curiosity to see how much they’d increase it by and was amazed,” she said. “They said they’d do all these repairs to it that it needed between tenancies but it was leased out the day after the bond clean. So clearly nothing was done.” SQM Research’s managing director, Louis Christopher, said the rental crisis had worsened in the past month with vacancy rates across Australia falling to just 1% in March, down from 1.2% in February. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It represents half the total number of vacant rentals reported a year ago and is the lowest national rate since 2006, at a time when cost of living is outpacing wage increases. The number of vacancies Australia-wide now stands at 36,868 properties, with smaller capital cities Hobart and Adelaide worst hit with a 0.3% vacancy rate. Sydney has a 1.6% vacancy rate, down from 3.4% in March last year, while Melbourne – hard-hit by Covid-19 lockdowns in the past two years – is sitting at 1.9%, down from 4.4%. “As a result, market rents have exploded,” Christopher said. “Some of our capital cities and regions are recording [as] asking rental increases in excess of 15% over the past 12 months … and the recent monthly data suggests we are still not at the worst point of the crisis. “It is likely homelessness will be increasing in this environment. Yet, when I consider the current election stances for the major and minor parties, there is a dearth of specific policy in addressing the issues surrounding housing affordability.” At the same time, expected relief for regional Australia as Covid restrictions ease and renters return to the cities has not eventuated, with many localities and townships recording zero vacancy rates. Parts of Ballarat, Gippsland, the Yarra ranges, the Dandenong ranges in Victoria and the Blue Mountains in New South Wales have no rentals available, as do suburbs in Hobart and Adelaide. Sonja Holness moved to Gippsland in regional Victoria with her family six years ago, when rental prices in the area were just starting to increase. “We were initially paying $250 a week for a four bedroom house with a decent yard,” she said. “We now pay $360 for a three bedroom home with no back yard and our landlord sharing the property. “We’re lucky, average rent here is $450 and above. My town has had a zero vacancy rate since 2018 … when we had to move in 2020 we applied for every property in a 50km radius, and were turned down for every one we applied for.” Holness says she only secured the property her family is in now as she knew the house was empty, and that the owners lived behind it. “We knocked on their door and were lucky they gave us a chance,” she said. “I was five days away from living in a caravan park with my partner and three kids. Things have only gotten worse. “There are more rentals now but people that rented here for their whole lives can’t afford them. It’s pushing people further out or back to the suburbs.” Rebecca Goldsmith has been applying for houses throughout regional Victoria since she was told her rental had been sold six weeks ago. Goldsmith was given a maximum 30 days’ notice to vacate her property, on the border of Victoria and New South Wales. “I’ve been applying for houses with no luck yet. I’m even applying for houses that are hours away,” she said. “I have three kids, I’m pregnant again and my youngest two are two and under. “The rental crisis is bullshit.” Goldsmith said she hadn’t been able to secure public housing, as none were vacant and her area had a significant waiting list. “Houses … aren’t really in my budget. A three bedroom in my area used to be around $250 a week. Now they are anywhere between $300 and $420 a week.”",News/Australia news,Rental prices in Australian capital cities spike by up to 21% as available housing plummets,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/13/rental-prices-in-australian-capital-cities-spike-by-up-to-21-as-available-housing-plummets
