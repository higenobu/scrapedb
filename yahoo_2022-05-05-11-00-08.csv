5/5/2022,"In a familiar development on Fox News, “The Five” devolved into a shouting match Wednesday after Greg Gutfeld went on an offensive rant. The argument culminated in co-host Geraldo Rivera calling Gutfeld “arrogant” and “you insulting punk” before the other panelists smoothed things over and moved on to another speaker. The rant that spawned the argument began during a discussion about abortion rights, in the wake of the explosive Supreme Court draft majority opinion leak that would overturn Roe v. Wade. Gutfeld argued that “pro-lifers win because they can state their case.” “If you ask somebody why they’re pro-life, they will say, because abortion takes a life and we believe life is sacred. You can disagree with that,” he said. “But the problem with the pro-choicers is that they don’t have the balls to state their case plainly.” “Just say, like, I prefer freedom over fetuses,” added Gutfeld, who last week told viewers, “welcome to the freedom party lefties” after Elon Musk said he was buying Twitter. Geraldo: You insulting punk pic.twitter.com/hGjsEJCVpx — Acyn (@Acyn) May 4, 2022 He then went on to argue that people who support abortion are “more concerned about what they will lose than what they will gain” adding that mothers realize after giving birth that their lives would be “nothing” without their children. “A pro-choice mom can look at her adorable two-year-old and think, ‘my life would be nothing without her,’ in 2022. (But) in 2017, when she was young and single, didn’t have a kid, she could only imagine the loss of her freedom. Right? So that’s the issue.” He called on pro-choice advocates to “just be honest” and admit that “yeah, it kills an unborn kid, but I prefer my freedom.” He wrapped up his tirade by claiming “it used to be [that] even the pro-choicers would admit that abortion was an ugly thing, but they felt it had to be a necessary evil.” “But now when you go anywhere on social media, it’s something to celebrate, to cherish, to shout.” “That’s baloney,” Rivera interrupted, before the name-calling began. Earlier in the segment, Rivera had argued in favor of abortion access. “What am I going to tell my daughters now, that they don’t have control over their body? That they can’t make those choices for themselves?” he asked. “That some old man scratching his belly in some other state is going to [make that choice for you]?” Fox News viewers thrashed Rivera on Twitter after the altercation, with some calling for him to be removed from the show for his dissenting views. The veteran Fox News pundit was a longtime friend of Donald Trump but grew critical of the former president over his 2020 election lies and the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection he incited.

5/5/2022,"Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) has responded to a video circulating on social media that appears to show the conservative congressman in the nude, making thrusting motions near the face of another man. “A new hit against me just dropped,” the GOP lawmaker tweeted on Wednesday. “Years ago, in this video, I was being crass with a friend, trying to be funny. We were acting foolish, and joking. That’s it.” A new hit against me just dropped.

Years ago, in this video, I was being crass with a friend, trying to be funny.

We were acting foolish, and joking.

That’s it.

I’m NOT backing down.

I told you there would be a drip drip campaign.

Blackmail won't win. We will. — Madison Cawthorn (@CawthornforNC) May 4, 2022 It’s unclear who shot the video or how it became public. Cawthorn characterized it as part of a “drip drip campaign” ― presumably, one meant to discredit him as his reelection bid approaches ― and asserted that “blackmail won’t win.” The roughly 30-second clip shows what appears to be a nude Cawthorn in a bed thrusting with his groin near the head of an unidentified person. A male voice can be heard saying, “Oh ma yah yah oh” repeatedly. A male voice can also be heard laughing and saying, “stick it in his face.” Madison Cawthorn in April. (Photo: AP Photo/Chris Seward) The video footage emerged after photos surfaced showing Cawthorn wearing women’s lingerie ― images he said were from a “goofy” game on a cruise ― and a video that showed one of his male staff members grabbing his crotch. The latter video has sparked an ethics complaint, The Washington Times reported. Cawthorn’s critics have noted that such videos and images suggest hypocrisy on the part of a right-wing lawmaker, who has said he adheres to “a lot of traditional values and a lot of traditional ideas” and has complained that members of the LGBTQ community have gone too far in pursuing their rights. The North Carolina Republican has also made headlines over allegations of insider trading, trying to bring a loaded handgun onto a plane for the second time and having to surrender his driver’s license after driving with a suspended license. In late March, he also raised some eyebrows when he claimed that the D.C. elite had previously invited him to orgies and done cocaine in front of him.

5/5/2022,"An Alabama corrections official who vanished with an inmate facing capital murder charges “may have been brainwashed” into helping him escape, her mother-in-law said Tuesday. The pair could be anywhere by now, Frances White told The Daily Beast, explaining that Lauderdale County Assistant Director of Corrections Vicky Sue White, 56, was frugal and had amassed enough money to keep her afloat for some time. “She had said that she’d like to live in Florida, that’s the only thing I can think of,” Frances White, 88, said in a phone interview Tuesday morning. As the search for Vicky White and 38-year-old Casey Cole White (no relation) stretches into its fifth day, her late husband’s family doesn’t know what to think. Frances White said her son, Thomas White, died in January from complications related to Parkinson’s disease. “I’m just proud he wasn’t still alive, cause he still thought she was a good person,” she said. “I can’t imagine her running off with that guy, but you never know. He walked into a woman’s house and stabbed her.” Inmate Charged with Capital Murder Disappears with Corrections Officer of 25 Years Casey White was awaiting trial at the Lauderdale County Jail after confessing to stabbing 58-year-old Connie Ridgeway to death in 2015. The six-foot-nine White, who pleaded not guilty to killing Ridgeway, had already been sentenced in 2019 to 75 years for a crime spree in Limestone County that same year for attempting to gun down his ex-girlfriend, stealing an SUV, shooting and killing a dog, and taking three hostages. “He stated that he wanted to kill her and have the police kill him,” said a police report from the case. “His only regret was that neither was successful. He stated that if he was released he would kill the victim.” Vicky White, who had an “unblemished record,” according to Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton, was last seen on April 29, leaving the county jail with Casey White to take him to court for a mental health evaluation. Casey White was handcuffed and shackled in the back of her patrol car, said Singleton. But Vicky White had committed a serious breach of protocol by transporting Casey White solo, contravening a policy put in place to have two sworn deputies with him during any movements following the discovery in 2020 of an escape plan he was allegedly concocting. Vicky White said she was headed to a doctor’s appointment after dropping Casey White off. However, Singleton said Casey White did not have an evaluation scheduled for that day, and Vicky White never showed up at the medical facility. Her patrol car was later found abandoned in the parking lot of a nearby shopping center. After first saying that investigators were looking into whether Vicky White willingly helped Casey White escape, or if she had been threatened or coerced into it, Singleton said Monday that “indications are” that she was in on it. A press release issued Tuesday by the Lauderdale County Sheriff’s Department said there had been a “special relationship between Director White and inmate Casey White. That relationship has now been confirmed through our investigation by independent sources and means.” On Tuesday, Frances White was still racking her brain trying to make sense of what happened. “Everybody’s trying to figure out what made her do it,” she told The Daily Beast. “Somebody said, ‘Maybe she was just having a bad day.’ I said, ‘Well, that’s not an excuse.’” The two had six hours to get away, White continued, “So, they’re not around here.” “I don’t have any idea where she is,” she said, noting that her former daughter-in-law had spoken about eventually retiring to Florida. Vicky White had just submitted her retirement papers the day before she disappeared, and her mom told local news outlet WAAY that nothing seemed out of the ordinary on their last morning together. About five weeks ago, she sold the home she had shared with her late husband and moved in with her mother. News reports described Vicky as flush with cash from the sale, but Frances White said she spent years socking away cash and would have plenty of it on hand. “She had money before she sold her home,” Frances White told The Daily Beast. “She saved her money. I figure if she’s still got her money, she’s still got enough to live on for a while.” Casey White faces the death penalty if convicted of Ridgeway’s murder. He “doesn’t have anything to lose, she’s got everything to lose,” said Frances White, who added, “I don’t think that man’s got any feelings for anybody.” In the aftermath of Friday’s escape, Ridgeway’s son, Austin Williams, called Casey White a “monster.” Vicky White was armed at the time, and Singleton said Casey White should now be considered armed and dangerous. An arrest warrant for Vicky White, a copy of which was obtained by The Daily Beast, has been issued on charges of permitting or aiding escape in the first degree. Casey White is wanted on one count of second-degree escape. A $10,000 reward has been offered for information leading to their capture. The case brings to mind another infamous jailbreak carried out with the assistance of a female prison employee. Joyce Mitchell, a prison seamstress, spent more than four years behind bars for helping two inmates break out of the maximum-security Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York, in 2015. Mitchell, who had been having an affair with one of the men, was released in 2020. Frances White’s two surviving sons are in just as much shock as she is, she said: “They can’t believe it either. My oldest son, no way could he picture her leaving with him… It looks like she helped him escape.” Everybody in the family is hoping someone will come forward with a lead, she said. “You know, there’s a $10,000 reward out, and somebody will tell them something,” she said. “I thought if she had talked to anybody, maybe they would come forward to get that money… Maybe he’s got her brainwashed. But I don't know how he’d have had a chance to get her brainwashed, because he was in prison.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

5/5/2022,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Sweden has received assurances from the United States that it would receive support during the period a potential application to join NATO is processed by the 30 nations in the alliance, Foreign Minister Ann Linde said in Washington on Wednesday. Sweden and neighbour Finland stayed out of NATO during the Cold War, but Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its invasion of Ukraine have led the countries to rethink their security policies, with NATO membership looking increasingly likely. Both countries are concerned they would be vulnerable during an application process, which could take up to a year to be approved by all NATO's members. ""Naturally, I'm not going to go into any details, but I feel very sure that now we have an American assurance,"" Linde told Swedish TV from Washington after meeting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. ""However, not concrete security guarantees, those you can only get if you are a full member of NATO,"" she added. Linde declined to say what assurances she had received from Blinken. ""They would mean that Russia can be clear that if they direct any kind of negative activities against Sweden, which they have threatened, it would not be something that the U.S. would just allow to happen ... without a response,"" she said. A U.S. State Department statement issued after the meeting said Blinken had reaffirmed Washington's commitment to NATO's policy of welcoming new members, but it made no mention of security assurances. Sweden's defence minister said last month that an application could trigger a number of responses from Russia, including cyber attacks and hybrid measures - such as propaganda campaigns - to undermine Sweden's security. Moscow has warned it could deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in the European exclave of Kaliningrad if Sweden and Finland become NATO members. Linde, who will now travel to Canada to discuss security matters with its government, said the United States was strongly supportive of Swedish and Finnish membership in NATO, which would increase stability in the Baltic and Arctic regions. Both Sweden and Finland are expected to make a decision about whether to apply to join NATO this month.
