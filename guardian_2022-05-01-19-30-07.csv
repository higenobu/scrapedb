5/1/2022,"The wry grin pasted across Katie Taylor’s bruised, swollen face told the whole story. Ireland’s greatest athlete had just navigated the deepest waters of her career to roar back from near-defeat and retain her undisputed lightweight championship with a split-decision win over Amanda Serrano, a heart-stopping affair before a sold-out crowd of 19,187 rollicking spectators that Taylor described as a “career-defining performance”. “I had to dig deep in there tonight,” Taylor told reporters early Sunday morning in the bowels of Madison Square Garden. “This is a special, special moment. The best night of my career for sure. I wasn’t sure if anything could reach my Olympic gold medal moment, but tonight was absolutely the best moment of my career.” Through the opening rounds Taylor relied on her superior hand and foot speed to ward off the heavy-handed Serrano’s unsparing pressure, opening an early lead while boxing beautifully off the back foot. But Serrano hurt Taylor badly after finally cornering her elusive foe early in the fifth, leaving the champion bloodied, seemingly exhausted and fortunate to escape the round. “I think I was boxing very, very well in the early rounds and I just got stuck in a fight her,” Taylor said. “I think the courage and the strength comes back in those moments just purely from the hard work that I put in in training camp over the last few months. It’s in those moments that the hard work of training pays off. I don’t just show courage on fight night. I show courage every single day in training, day after day after day. That’s exactly why you train hard, for those moments when you actually are in the trenches.” From there Taylor delivered the finishing kick of a champion, winning the final three rounds on all three judges’ scorecards to keep her WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO lightweight titles. “My corner was saying to me that I needed the championship rounds,” Taylor said. “I did what I had to do. I showed a champion’s heart in there as I always do.” The exceptional quality, narrow margin and smashing business of Saturday’s fight – a long awaited showdown between the consensus No 1 and No 2 fighters on women’s boxing’s pound-for-pound list – all but ensures a rematch. Even in the immediate aftermath, Taylor was quick to embrace the prospect. “We all want to see the best versus the best,” she said. “A rematch would be absolutely phenomenal. If it was in Dublin, we could sell out Croke Park. We’ve seen something special here tonight, but imagine fighting in front of 80,000 or 90,000 people at Croke Park. Absolutely that can happen.” Before taking leave from the media throng for several weeks of hard-won rest and relaxation with her family, Taylor reflected on the history made on Saturday night as she and Serrano became the first female fighters to headline a bill in this storied venue’s 140-year history and the first women to earn more than $1m each from a single bout. “That’s the best part about this journey, is being able to inspire young girls and inspire the next generation,” Taylor said. “I think both myself and Amanda have broken so many barriers over the last few years in our sport. I guess we’re both winners in a certain way tonight for what we did and what we achieved.”",Sport/Sport,Katie Taylor revels in ‘best night of career’ after historic win over Serrano,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/01/katie-taylor-revels-in-best-night-of-career-after-historic-win-amanda-serrano-boxing
5/1/2022,"A culture of misogyny and harassment in parliament has been worsened by the government’s repeated attempts to delay disciplinary action against misbehaving Tory MPs, Keir Starmer has argued, saying that “a fish rots from the head”. Starmer said real change had to be “led and modelled from the top” when asked about new claims of abusive and sexualised behaviour by MPs following the resignation of the Conservative backbencher Neil Parish for watching pornography in the Commons chamber. The Labour leader said the instinct of Downing Street in a series of previous misconduct cases had been either to try to ignore the issue or to delay any robust action. “What we have seen from this government, time and again, is when one of their own gets into a difficulty, into a problem, they’ve done something they shouldn’t have done, whether it’s Owen Paterson, whether it’s the Wakefield MP [Imran Ahmad Khan], or Neil Parish, their first instinct is to push it off into the long grass, hide what’s happening,” Starmer told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show. “That is a political problem, because a fish rots from the head, and there needs to be political leadership on this as well. And we haven’t seen that yet from the Conservative party.” Speaking earlier on the show, Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, rejected the idea that there was a wider issue about standards in Westminster. “I don’t think there’s a culture of misogyny,” he said. “I think the problem we have is that people are working in a really intense environment. There are long hours, and I think generally, most people know their limits, they know how to act respectfully. “But there are some instances where people don’t, frankly, act according to the highest standards.” Starmer rejected this, saying: “Those who are engaged in this sort of activity, whether it’s comments about Angela Rayner or watching porn in the House of Commons, have to take responsibility.” However, neither Starmer nor Kwarteng had any specific suggestions on how matters could be improved, beyond agreeing that one possibility could be a suggestion by the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, to end the current system by which MPs employ their staff directly. Kwarteng rejected the idea of all-women shortlists to improve the gender balance of Conservative MPs, saying he had “never been a fan of quotas”. He also rejected the idea of closing bars in parliament: “No, they shouldn’t all be shut, I don’t think we should have an excessively puritanical severe regime in that regard.” Also speaking on the Ridge show, the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said that as well as examining Hoyle’s idea for the employment of MPs staff, the existing independent complaints system for parliamentary workers should be speeded up. Hoyle’s idea would mark a significant overhaul of working practices in Westminster. Writing in the Observer, Hoyle said: “I believe it is time we reviewed our working practices, and particularly whether it is right that individual MPs are the employers of their staff. Should someone else – or an outside body – employ the staff, as long as the MP has the right to choose them? “In my opinion, it is time to consider radical action, and review structures and processes that could make a difference. Some serious allegations have been made, and we must address them as a matter of urgency. It is imperative we do the right thing by staff and MPs as well.”",News/Politics,"Tory failure to act has made Commons misogyny worse, says Keir Starmer",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/01/commons-misogyny-worse-cover-ups-keir-starmer
5/1/2022,"Dan O’Dowd is hardly the first California tech titan to bankroll his own campaign for high political office. What makes him unusual is that he has no interest in winning the US Senate seat he is vying for, or even in challenging the other candidates competing in the 7 June primary. O’Dowd, a software entrepreneur with a 40-year history of working on military, aerospace and other commercial contracts, is running, rather, out of frustration at his fellow tech entrepreneur, Elon Musk, whom he accuses of endangering road safety with a driver assistance software package he’s put in his Tesla electric cars. O’Dowd doesn’t deny that this is a strikingly narrow platform on which to run for public office. He’s aware, too, that there are risks as well as potential rewards in using a political campaign to take a swing at the world’s richest man – especially now that Musk is dominating headlines as the prospective new owner of Twitter. But O’Dowd is also unapologetic about being a single-issue candidate. His mission, he says, is to ensure that government regulators become much tougher with the “move fast and break things” ethos that has inspired Musk and many other tech pioneers over the past two decades. He’s spent $650,000 on advertising so far and seems poised to spend a lot more over the next six weeks. And, in his mind, it’s not just about Musk. O’Dowd believes that the problems he’s documented with Tesla’s “full self-driving” software package – problems that, according to publicly available video footage, have caused vehicles to veer unexpectedly into the wrong lane, turn the wrong way, crash into poles and endanger other road users – are emblematic of a broader and increasingly serious problem. In a world increasingly dependent on computers to run critical machinery, O’Dowd says, it’s vital that the software is built as securely and reliably as possible, only Silicon Valley rarely sees it that way. If we can’t stop semi-autonomous cars crashing into things, he argues, how are we supposed to keep our power grids, hospitals, office computers and other vital systems safe from cyber attack and other threats? O’Dowd has spent his career aspiring to build “software that never fails and can’t be hacked” for projects including fighter jets, nuclear bombers and a space exploration vehicle for Nasa, so the issue is deeply personal to him. “The bigger picture,” he said, “is about software and computers in general. It’s about making computers safe for humanity.” Political analysts have been scratching their heads over this pitch from the moment O’Dowd announced his late entry into the Senate race on 19 April. Was this really a politically motivated campaign, they asked, or just a branding exercise to drum up business for O’Dowd’s Santa Barbara-based company, Green Hills Software, and whose clients include several of Tesla’s car making rivals including General Motors, BMW and Daimler? Was O’Dowd targeting Tesla because he really thought it was behaving worse than the dozens of other companies working to develop a self-driving car, or was he merely piggy-backing on Musk’s name recognition to attract media attention? “It’s unusual for a campaign to be so singularly focused on a very discrete commercial issue,” said Dan Weiner, director of the elections and government program at the Brennan Center for Justice. “You could say this is the apotheosis of a system in which corporate interests have free rein to engage with the political process.” O’Dowd insisted that his campaign had nothing to do with commercial self-interest. Rather, he said, he found Tesla’s “full self-driving” software package more alarming than anything else in commercial use because it was, in his words, “amazingly terrible” – a car guidance system that, according to his analysis, goes wrong every eight minutes, whereas similarly experimental guidance systems run by competitors including the Google subsidiary Waymo typically go tens of thousands of miles before encountering problems. O’Dowd was similarly dismissive of the notion, promoted by Tesla, that such problems can be fixed by patching the software with online upgrades. His analysis is far from a consensus position in the industry. Many experts say that everyone is struggling to crack the problem of producing a reliable self-driving car and that the problem of cybersecurity – making sure a bad actor cannot gain control of a fleet of tens of thousands of cars through their operating software – is a particularly vexing one across the board. Chris Clark, a software security expert with Synopsys, a California company that tests software and designs computer systems for the car industry, said he did not think O’Dowd’s rollout campaign ad, showing the Tesla “full self-driving” program malfunctioning over and over, was especially fair. “You could make a similar video about just about any other company out there,” he said, adding that by his count the number of enterprises working on a self-driving car was close to 300. “This is an industry-wide challenge … The driver is always supposed to be paying attention and protect the vehicle if it does something unexpected.” Clark also took issue with O’Dowd’s argument that government regulators are not focusing enough on road safety as car companies grow increasingly experimental with their automated features. “Yes, it is the wild west,” he said, “but there are sheriffs in town to ensure the industry does what it can to protect consumers.” Both the federal National Highway Transport Safety Administration and the California Department of Motor Vehicles are investigating Tesla’s driver enhancement software following a flurry of documented malfunctions. Meanwhile, Lena Gonzalez, the chair of the transportation committee in the California state senate, is pushing to close a loophole whereby Tesla is exempted from reporting crash data on its “full self-driving” package. “Senator Gonzalez believes protecting California drivers is of the utmost importance,” her office said in a statement. It’s not entirely clear what else O’Dowd thinks government regulators should be doing, or how he can further his cause by running for a senate seat that the incumbent, Alex Padilla, is expected to win easily. It’s more common for influential industry players to lobby government directly (O’Dowd said he’s tried), and if that fails, to sponsor a ballot initiative calling for a specific change in public policy. O’Dowd said: “I didn’t think of a ballot initiative.” O’Dowd was eloquent about the urgent need to use the highest grade software to build critical infrastructure – a theme he has spent years building into a public campaign he calls the Dawn Project. But he struggled to square that lofty goal with his focus on petty online squabbles, in which Musk supporters accuse him of being slow, out of touch, and worse, and he fires back that Musk’s cars are being driven by “artificial stupidity”. Musk himself had a go at O’Dowd in January, after the Dawn Project took out a full-page advertisement in the New York Times to attack him. “Green Hills software is a pile of trash,” Musk tweeted back. He has kept quiet ever since.",News/US news,California tech titan’s Senate run has one target: Tesla’s self-driving software,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/01/dan-odowd-us-senate-tesla-self-driving-elon-musk
5/1/2022,"The screenwriter Abi Morgan, best known for the films The Iron Lady, Shame and Suffragette and more recently for the much-loved BBC series The Split, works in a small flat above a perfumery in Islington, north London. Its rooms, pale and sleekly minimalist, not only smell lovely, the rose geranium and vetiver floating obligingly upwards; they’re also, for a writer, extraordinarily tidy. The casual visitor would not think for a single moment of fraught commissioning meetings and hurtling deadlines were it not for the little squares of paper that line one wall, on which the episodes of her latest project are neatly summarised. But like everything about Morgan, this tranquility is, perhaps, deceptive. While she, too, exudes a warm, outward calm, her interest extending to everyone she meets, inwardly it’s a different story. Sometimes, it’s as if a bomb has gone off deep inside her. “I am both absolutely the same and profoundly changed,” she says, sitting at her white table, turning her white coffee cup in her hand. Morgan is about to publish her first book, This Is Not a Pity Memoir, which tells the story of all that happened to her family between June 2018 and June 2021. It begins, as most stories of catastrophe and loss do, on a day like any other. On this morning, her now husband, the actor Jacob Krichefski, who has MS, doesn’t feel fantastic, but Abi, who’s tired and only wants to be able to drop their children at school and head to work, is unsympathetic: has he, she wants to know, taken a paracetamol? It’s a crotchety-ness – “you’re a bad nurse,” he says, just before she leaves – that she will soon come to regret. When she arrives home that afternoon, Jacob is lying on the bathroom floor, his lips blue, dried blood caked around his mouth. An ambulance is called and it’s blue lights all the way. In hospital, Jacob has a series of seizures and his behaviour grows ever more strange and erratic, so strange and erratic, in fact, that he is soon transferred to the intensive therapy unit at London’s National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Queen Square, one of the best neurological departments in the world. All the scans and tests keep coming back fine. Perhaps its experts can solve the mystery. But no. For the time being – it will be months before she learns that the withdrawal of a supposed wonder drug for MS, for which Jacob was part of a trial, has caused his collapse (he is one of just 22 patients to have suffered this catastrophic response) – the mystery continues and his condition worsens. Slipping in and out of consciousness, his body begins to shut down. The treatments the growing team of doctors around him try – he has been found to have a type of brain inflammation called anti-NDMA receptor encephalitis – fail to work. His blood pressure fluctuates, his breathing grows shallower. Finally, it is decided: Jacob must be put into an induced coma, a sleep from which he will not wake for seven months. And when he does wake up, it’s not the end of the story. Another story is just beginning. For months, Jacob will be in rehab. In the end, he will spend 443 days in hospital. He will return home a changed man. Someone who needs round-the-clock care. Someone who doesn’t recognise the woman who has spent so long at his bedside, feeling terrified. Meanwhile, a bell is now “clanging” inside her, too. Something is wrong. She doesn’t feel right, either. In April 2019, soon after Jacob has emerged from his coma but while he is still in hospital, she is diagnosed with a rare and rapacious form of breast cancer. Her treatment for this – a mastectomy and chemotherapy – goes on into the autumn, even as she continues, as often as she is able, to drive to the hospital to see Jacob, and lasts until February 2020, by which time he is home, but the Covid-19 pandemic is about to land. This will make everything a good deal more complicated, for them as for everyone; it will also mean that when Jacob suffers a relapse – problems with his breathing – no one will be able to visit him in hospital. Morgan doesn’t, to put it mildly, go in for self-pity. Her book, even when things are at their most bleak, is both very funny and as propulsive as a thriller, ticking along in an adrenalised real time, impossible to put down. But then, as she observes, in times of crisis it’s useful to be a writer. However huge her heart – her book, not without reason, is billed by its publisher as a love story – there’s no denying that it also contains an icy chip that makes pretty much everything fair game as material. “How do I feel about the book now?” she asks. “I feel that it’s like when you get really drunk and then the next day you wonder: what the hell did I say? I’d be lying if I told you that I hadn’t worried about invading Jacob’s privacy. My sister was its first reader, then my children, then Jacob’s family; I knew before I took it to any publisher they all had to be comfortable. But I’m also a dramatist and Jacob is an actor. We’re used to being fascinated not only with other people’s lives, but with – on the most narcissistic level, probably – our own, too.” After he’d woken from his coma, Jacob experienced, for a time, a delusion that Morgan was not his partner of three decades and the mother of his children, but an impostor: “When that happened I do remember thinking: this has got to earn its keep. It [writing] was almost in retaliation.” What was it like, not to be recognised by him? “It was like a bad party game. There was something genuinely peculiar and creepy and terrifying about it. It really shook me; I was literally shaking. And having been rubbed out myself, I have a slight delusion now. ‘Is this real?’ I sometimes think [when I’m with Jacob]. ‘Are you really back? Do you know me?’” Was it lonely, living with him through this? “Oh, I had huge loneliness. It was only when he looked in the mirror and I saw that he didn’t recognise himself that I stopped feeling so alone. But I fought it. I was so indignant about it, so angry with the delusion, that I thought: screw you. I got very insane, trying to get him back. I would screw with him. I’d pinch him and poke him; I’d be annoying. I’d move things – I’d slide his porridge bowl to the other end of the table – as a way to get him to acknowledge me.” If trauma is “unbelievably boring” in its relentlessness, it’s also, she believes, “incredibly stimulating”. But writing the book was more than a creative act; in so many ways, it was an anchor. “Primarily, I did it because I was losing my mind and I was trying to hold on to my sanity,” she says. “I was very, very frightened and I didn’t want my children to be frightened; I thought that if I could hold it all and write it down for them to read… that they might feel that [a book] was a safe place, as if it was over there, rather than here.” And then there was Jacob. Not only did she want to write down what he’d missed, all the stuff he would never remember. She longed to be able to talk to him. Writing was the best available substitute for conversation. “I wasn’t talking to the Jacob of now. I was talking to the Jacob before he collapsed. I was almost shouting into the cave, to hear what echoed back.” Whose story is it, really? She wrestles with this. “I grimace slightly when I see it called a love story. But it is. If it’s brutal, the person it’s most brutal about is me. When my daughter read it, she said, ‘Mum, are you OK with people not liking you?’ And there is a truth to that.” But I can’t imagine, even for a minute, any reader taking against her. In person, she is intensely likable, the kind of woman you want to make your friend. I like her big, round spectacles and her denim shirt with its puff sleeves; I like her talk of batty diets and all the questions she asks me about my life (you’d tell her anything – and I do). And so it is on the page, too. She seems so lovable, without even trying, and so do her children and extended family. The couple have so much support, so many good friends. I’m ashamed to say that I felt (almost) envious. She pulls a face. “I say in the book that I fell in love with Jake’s dad before I fell in love with him. We have walked side by side in caring for him. But if it all sounds a bit Seven Brides for Seven Brothers… I’d want to punch someone in the face who sounded like that. There was a huge anger, too. I was very territorial over Jacob. I understood why widows throw themselves on to coffins, physically trying to hold on to somebody.” What about her children? They seem to have coped so well. “They were 14 and 16 when Jacob collapsed. They were on the edge of being cooked and I don’t know how we would have managed if they had been tiny. But yes, they were amazing running partners.” She met Jacob at a party. She’d always vowed not to get involved with an actor, but there he was: they collided with “absolute velocity”. By their fifth date, he’d virtually moved in. Their relationship wasn’t without its complications – their daughter was a baby when they first had counselling – but she was also certain about him, this energetic, joy-chaser of a man. Her parents (her mother is the actor Pat England, her father the theatre director Gareth Morgan) divorced when she was small, though they remained friendly, and somehow this has worked in her favour. “I’ve always felt less, rather than more, likely to separate,” she says. “Though I am curious about the legacy of divorce, for children.” She once said that her father’s decision to leave his marriage involved courage. Does she still feel this? “Yes, totally. It’s incredibly hard to leave a marriage.” This was one of the things she wanted to explore in The Split, a series based around two sisters and their mother, all of whom are divorce lawyers. “Divorce isn’t failure,” she says. “Some marriages are finite. We don’t all die of consumption at 40. We live long lives – too long, sometimes, to spend with one person. And marriage is changing. I got married to Jacob at a point when all the archetypal reasons for marriage are no longer there.” She laughs. “Marriage for me was a desire to adopt Jake.” Ah, yes. Spoiler alert. Reader, she married him. This Is Not a Pity Memoir ends with Abi telling Jacob that she thinks they should do it at last, if only for tax reasons. But he’s not convinced. “Hmm,” he says, eating some pomelo, newly remembered as his favourite fruit. In the end, she has to bribe him. “There’ll be cake,” she tells him, at which point he agrees. So when did it happen? “Last June, at Wood Green register office,” she says. “A perfect, funny, lopsided, comical day. Twenty four people: just close family and friends. Then we went to our favourite restaurant, Luca [in Clerkenwell], and there were speeches. Jacob was very quiet all day. At that time, he didn’t communicate very much. But he was smiley and from then onwards, he has steadily improved. The past six months, that improvement has been radical. He’s zinging. He’s 80% of himself. He banks up his life with activity: his ukulele, football, musicals. We’re lucky. I have the wherewithal. A lot of therapies have been thrown at him, and we have a fantastic carer who comes in on half days, and a housekeeper in the afternoons, so there’s always someone around. I’ve got huge hope and ambition for him.” Which parts of him have not returned? She thinks for a while. “I want to get this right. He has missed a profound experience. It’s like we’ve all been on a trip that he didn’t go on. So there’s that. He’s very happy. He’s sweet and funny. But he wants to be in the context of house and home. Psychiatric issues, emotional complexity, memory. Physically, he’s got bad balance. He can’t eat with his left hand. An interesting thing is that when a person has a brain injury, the body floods with calcium, to build the skull. These deposits have caused problems with movement on his left side.” Can she talk to him? “Our connection is really strong. Our friendship is back. Though it’s very recent that I can talk to him about a worry. His response will be thoughtful and genuine. But without… responsibility. He can’t drive the family forward.” I loathe it when people talk earnestly of learning from terrible experiences. But I do wonder what the landscape of her life looks like now. “That’s a good question, actually,” she says. For her part, she thinks – because it is realistic to do so – only in five-year blocks. “I know who I want in my boat now and I know what I need to survive. When you think you’re going to lose the person that you love, when you think that you’re going to die yourself, it becomes very clear what you need to stay alive and you don’t need as much as you think. So my ambition is slightly different now.” In spite of everything, she has the uncommon energy of the middle-aged woman, the feeling that, in some ways, she’s only just getting started. “A producer friend was talking about the next 10 years and she said, ‘You need to work out what you want to write.’ I’ve been thinking about that a lot. Do I want to be known for something, rather than lots of things?” She would like to direct and wants to be behind the camera when This Is Not a Pity Memoir becomes, as she hopes it will, a film. But really, what she has learned has mostly to do with love. “Let’s be honest. I’m a tufty-haired, one-breasted, fiftysomething woman who’s got a few Baftas and yes, that’s brilliant. But life also goes in cycles. I am not the big I-am. I think my greatest fear is to end up some old buffer at Bafta. Being with Jake, and what we went through as a family, has changed us. We have a greater appreciation of each other. We’ve seen each other at our worst moments. I didn’t realise I loved Jake so much – that’s the biggest revelation. It’s such a platitude, isn’t it, love? But… this hum. That’s the only way I can describe it. I just have this hum for Jake that I don’t have for anyone else.”  This Is Not a Pity Memoir is published on 12 May by John Murray Press (£14.99).

5/1/2022,"Price controls are often called for and sometimes implemented. We saw that when food prices spiked in the late 2000s and many poorer countries capped prices or banned exports. This year, the French government has limited energy price rises to 4%. In the UK, the energy price cap is a temporary form of price control – delaying, rather than preventing, energy bill rises. These controls happen despite economists overwhelmingly opposing them. They worry, rightly, in many cases, that imposing them can make shortages worse by removing incentives for new entrants to produce whatever is in short supply or for supply to be reallocated from areas of less scarcity. A new paper helps explain why economists don’t get their way, using a survey to investigate people’s responses to sudden price rises. The main conclusion is that economists ≠ the public, who prioritise morals over models; the vast majority favour price controls for reasons of fairness and access to goods, especially essentials, with only 32% favouring unregulated prices. Before the economists among you get depressed, the authors show public attitudes can shift significantly when exposed to the downsides of not allowing prices to rise. The most surprising finding – relevant for today’s inflation surge driven by the rising wholesale cost of energy – is that public support for unregulated prices only rises slightly (4.7 percentage points) when people are told that higher prices reflect higher production costs. The conclusion? Our energy suppliers should be expecting exactly zero success in their campaign to get the government to scrap the energy price cap.

5/1/2022,"Sitting across from the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda last week, partway through a royal tour to celebrate the Queen’s platinum jubilee, Prince Edward laughed awkwardly. Gaston Browne had just asked the prince whether he and his wife Sophie would use their “diplomatic influence” to push for the payment of slavery reparations to Britain’s former colonies. “We believe that all human civilisation should understand the atrocities that took place,” the Caribbean nation’s political leader told the Queen’s youngest son. In the same meeting came a second blow. “One day,” the prime minister told the couple, Antigua and Barbuda – a former British colony where the Queen is still the head of state – would cut ties with the monarchy and become a republic. Prince Edward shuffled nervously in his seat. “I wasn’t keeping notes, so I’m not going to give you a complete riposte,” he said. “But thank you for your welcome today.” The painful exchange was one in a series of historic moments in the Earl and Countess of Wessex’s week-long tour of the Caribbean, the second royal tour to the region in two months to be mired in controversy. By the end of the trip last Thursday, two Commonwealth nations had indicated their intention to cut ties with the royal family and become republics. St Kitts and Nevis also revealed its plan to review its ties with the monarchy. “The advancement of the decades has taught us that the time has come for St Kitts and Nevis to review its monarchical system of government and to begin the dialogue to advance to a new status,” Shawn Richards, deputy prime minister, told reporters. The declarations follow similar moves by other Commonwealth realms, several of which signalled their own plans to cut ties with the monarchy following a separate tour of the Caribbean by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in March. During that tour, William and Kate were accused of harking back to colonial days after they shook hands with crowds behind a wire mesh fence in Jamaica, and rode in the back of a Land Rover like the Queen did 60 years ago. Protesters accused them of benefiting from the “blood, tears and sweat” of slaves, while in the Bahamas they were urged to acknowledge the British economy was “built on the backs” of slaves and to pay reparations. Jamaica’s prime minister Andrew Holness told William and Kate that his country was “moving on” and may be the next to become a republic, while a minister from Belize said it was time to “take the next step in truly owning our independence”. The latest declarations mean six of the 14 countries beyond the UK that have the Queen as head of state have now indicated that they want to remove her – Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica and St Kitts and Nevis. If they do they will join countries including Trinidad, Guyana, Dominica and most recently Barbados, which became the world’s newest republic in November. The royal tours have also led to renewed calls for reparations – an acknowledgement of the history of enslavement and payment for the damage – from Britain and the monarchy, even from countries with no current plans to cut ties with the Queen. In St Vincent and the Grenadines – which held a referendum on becoming a republic in 2009 that failed to pass when 55% of voters voted against such a move, and has no current plans for another vote – protesters as well as supporters greeted Edward and Sophie during their visit. “This wrong was done against a sector of the human race by another and this wrong must be compensated,” said Idesha Jackson, 47, one protester who came out during the Wessexes’ visit. The controversy has led to concern at the Palace. After returning to the UK in March, Prince William acknowledged the monarchy’s days in the Caribbean may be numbered. “‘I know that this tour has brought into even sharper focus questions about the past and the future,” he said, adding that the future was “for the people to decide upon”. On Saturday it was reported that after getting home William and Kate summoned senior staff for a meeting to “clear the air”, with a source telling the Mirror they felt they had been “poorly prepared”. “If they aren’t in tune with what is going on in the world they will be left fighting for their futures,” the source said. For now, future royal tours would be “unwise”, said Peter Hunt, the former BBC royal correspondent. “The world has moved on in the wake of the Windrush scandal and Black Lives Matter,” he said. “Any future trips would be unwise. The role of Britain and the monarchy in the slave trade would feature, and the royals appear ill-equipped to rise to the occasion.”",News/UK news,"Royals, republicanism and reparations: Wessexes feel the heat in Caribbean",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/01/royals-republicanism-and-reparations-wessexes-feel-the-heat-on-antigua-visit
5/1/2022,"Hot, dry winds will continue to spur flames burning through the drought-stricken landscapes in the south-west and the American plains, complicating efforts to extinguish roughly a dozen destructive wildfires that have already driven thousands from their homes. Risks are usually higher in the region during this time of year and fire conditions typically ramp up in the months sandwiched between winter and summer rain seasons. But experts say the explosive start is an indication of what’s to come in the warming months. Spiking temperatures threaten to bake more moisture out of the thirsty environments, setting the stage for ignitions to turn into infernos. “Climate change is taking a situation that would be bad for us normally,” says Gregg Garffin, a climatologist at the University of Arizona, “and turning the dial up.” Once confined to specific times of year, wildfire conditions are stretching across more months, and will likely continue until the region gets additional rain. More than a million acres have already burned across the country since the start of this year, an amount more than double last year for this date, according to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). The agency’s accounting also shows that more fires have ignited this year than any other in the last decade and burn totals are more than 71% higher than the ten-year average. Last year’s exceptionally strong summer monsoon in the south-west – which delivered record rainfall in some areas – led to a lush landscape that has now begun to brown. With temperatures rising, the parched plants have turned to fuel for flames, driven faster by gusty winds. The conditions aren’t expected to abate anytime soon. Roughly 90% of the American west remains mired in drought with many areas desperately missing the winter rains they rely on to refill water-starved systems. “You have this desiccation going on due to climate change and you combine that with other factors,” Garffin said, noting the La Niña pattern that delivered less winter rains across areas of the west, “and it is really a year-round fire season.” La Niña is a climate system that develops in the Pacific ocean and delivers more dry days across the southern third of the US. Its drought-producing effects are especially pronounced in the south-west. The conditions have been particularly problematic in New Mexico, where five large fires have already burned more than 157,603 acres. The Southwest Coordination Center, the region’s hub for a national coordination system that organizes information and mobilizes resources between federal and state dispatch centers, has bumped its preparedness level to four – the second highest category – noting the rising strain on local resources. “That is like the bat signal saying, ‘hey we need help over here,’” says Candice Stevenson a public information officer at the NIFC, noting that the area may need more national resources in the south-west. The National level is currently at 2 and there are more teams available to deploy. With months left before its fire season typically peaks in June, more acres have already burned in New Mexico than in seven of the last eight years. “We have been busier than we have in the past with fire activity,” says Scott Overpeck, warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service based in Albuquerque, comparing the start of the season to other bad drought years in 2011 and 2018. “We have been seeing the writing on the wall, in the sense that we know with the drought conditions that it is going to be a rough season.” April is also the state’s windiest month which has spurred the spread. With no rain in the forecast, the state is bracing for strong gusts expected through next week. “It is going to depend on when these storm systems come across and increase the winds that are really going to make trouble for us,” Overpeck says. Despite the harrowing conditions, firefighters made progress on the state’s largest blaze, the The Calf canyon and Hermits peak fire. The fire, which had already consumed more than 63,720 acres on Friday, was 37% contained. A red flag warning remained in effect, with wind gusts of up to 50 mph, poor relative humidity, and rising temperatures threatening to test containment lines into the weekend. Roughly 960 firefighters and other personnel battling the blaze are prioritizing the safety of structures, but hundreds of homes have already been lost and nearly 300 buildings total have been damaged or destroyed, according to New Mexico fire officials. Conditions are not likely to improve in the coming days or weeks. “We have a very large area from north-east New Mexico up into Colorado and western Kansas and we have designated it an extremely critical fire weather risk area,” says Bill Bunting, the chief of forecast operations at the Noaa/NWS Storm Prediction Center, noting that the dangerous combination of strong winds, low relative humidity, and dryness fuels “the rapid spread and erratic behavior of any fire that gets started”. Bunting added that this will make it “exceedingly difficult” to fight the fires already burning. There have already been a number of high-end fire weather danger days this year, according to Bunting and the threats are expected to persist. The NIFC has predicted an above-normal fire potential lasting through the spring in areas from the high plains through the south-west. The threats will also linger farther west, into central Oregon and northern California this spring, and will only grow there through the summer and autumn. With the snowpack waning, the agency also noted that historic water sources used for suppression might not be available. “There will be wetting rains in some areas but overall, it does suggest that it is going to be an active fire season,” Bunting says. “It is just a reminder – you can have dangerous fire conditions any time of the year.”",News/World news,‘Turning the dial up’: US south-west braces for extended wildfire season amid drastic drought,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/01/us-new-mexico-drought-wildfire-southwest
5/1/2022,"When you think about Tennessee, you’re more likely to be thinking country music, barbecue and bourbon than crypto, blockchain and Web3. The state legislature has plans to change that. Tennessee just passed a bill that could help it become a leader in states providing a home to entrepreneurs who want to set up a unique kind of company that uses the blockchain to automate its decision-making. It’s called a DAO. More of that in a moment. First, a few definitions. The “blockchain” is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network and stores its information in a digital format and in such a way that changes can be made only once approvals from multiple parties are made in “the chain”. The blockchain is the foundation for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum, which use the unique identifiers of the blockchain to create their value. It’s all part of the new, distributed iteration of the internet, called web 3.0 or Web3. DAOs are another thing that’s grown from all of this: A DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is formed on the blockchain by multiple parties and, like other blockchain transactions, requires all decisions to be authorized by those members before actions can be taken. One example of a DAO is BeetsDAO, a company that aims to support projects in music, gaming and art. The organization pooled its members’ funds but, because it’s a DAO, no purchases can be made unless all the members democratically approve its transactions. A DAO has no leader. All of its moves are collective – and usually automated – driven by “smart” contracts that follow previously agreed-upon rules and are powered on the blockchain. Rules cannot be edited without people noticing – it’s transparent and public. “The dream,” BeetsDAO founder Jordan Garbis said during a panel discussion last year, is to “create networks of communities that actually drive the value of artists.” Garbis’ company made a name for itself by plunking down $250,000 for a digital piece created by Snoop Dogg and Nyan Cat. Many other companies in the Web3 world have formed themselves as DAOs because they feel it’s a better and more equitable way to do business. Now you may ask: what does all this have to do with Tennessee? As mentioned above, earlier this month the Tennessee state legislature unanimously passed a new bill that formally recognizes the registration of DAOs. Believe it or not, the only state to do this so far is Wyoming. Why do these states, which aren’t usually considered hot tech spots, care about this? It’s simple: jobs. “With this new business structure, Tennessee will a beacon for blockchain investment and new jobs,” state representative Jason Powell told the Nashville Scene. “Just as Delaware became a hub for traditional LLCs or South Dakota for credit card companies.” So will crypto entrepreneurs be flocking to Tennessee to start up their DAOs? Powell – and many other of the state’s legislators – certainly hope so. And they have cause for optimism. “Nashville is quickly becoming a hotbed for Web3 companies,” Mike Audi, a tech company founder and one of the first to become a legal DAO in the state told Decrypt, a news site that follows Web3 developments. “With supportive legislation expect to see more of it. Founders will flock here, build here and stay here.” DAOs represent a new type of corporate structure based on a new type of business model. The blockchain is creating countless entrepreneurs making money from digital products and digital currencies. Some governments have been slow to recognize the significance of this growing trend. But others – even from unlikely places like Tennessee – get it. And they’re adapting their laws to make it easy for tomorrow’s crypto entrepreneurs to succeed. That kind of forward thinking can only benefit the taxpayers they represent in the years to come.

5/1/2022,"The collective effort that goes into any building is underplayed, the roles of craftspeople, builders, assistants and clients – co-creators, often women – are overlooked. The fixed and the eternal is favoured over the transient and the mobile, exteriors over interiors, masonry over fabrics. One shouldn’t assign gender roles to building materials, but as that is in effect what was done in the past – stonecutting for boys, weaving for girls – historians’ privileging of the hard stuff again masculinises architecture. Radical Rooms, an exhibition at the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba), sets out to challenge these perceptions. It focuses on three houses commissioned and designed wholly or in part by women, and describes them from the inside out. It focuses on the floor plan – that is to say the arrangement of internal rooms – more than external form. Other projects relevant to the show’s themes, using material from Riba’s magnificent and underseen drawings collection, are also shown. The exhibition is by Charles Holland, formerly of the architects FAT, and the multidisciplinary artist Di Mainstone. It represents its subjects in what, as far as I know, is an unprecedented combination in the world of architectural exhibitions: on the one hand there are drawings and photos, small-scale and requiring close attention; on the other are room-high projections of actors and dancers, dramatising the women concerned with words, music and action. The whole space is a soundscape, with the voices of the protagonists moving from one section to the next on a 30-minute loop. It is unified, visually speaking, by coloured and patterned pillars of cloth – they enclose the drawings, such that you have to pull the curtains apart to see them, something like entering a changing room in a shop. The first of the show’s three main subjects is Hardwick Hall, the Elizabethan mansion in Derbyshire celebrated for its pioneering and radical use of glass, the work of its owner, Bess of Hardwick, and the architect Robert Smythson. The second is A la Ronde in Devon, an 18th-century house like no other. (Both are National Trust properties, open to the public.) It was created by the cousins Jane and Mary Parminter for their own use, and is circular in plan, with lozenge-shaped windows. The third is the Hopkins House in Hampstead, north London, a delicate two-storey pavilion in glass and steel designed in the 1970s by the architects Patty and Michael Hopkins for themselves, and where they still live. Hardwick Hall is represented by a plan, a 437-year-old piece of paper conveying matter-of-fact information, and photographs of the tapestry-hung interiors; its ruff-wearing builder Bess delivers a passionate Tudor rap about her passion for construction and her indignation at being called a “shrew”. The Parminters are portrayed as first-wave punks, cleaned-up versions of Siouxsie and the Banshees or the Slits, dressed in floor plans of their house. They sing of the inspirations for the seashell decorations that are one of its many distinctive features: “A grotto of crustaceans/ Captured our imaginations.” The Hopkins House sound is metallic and glassy, or Glassy – as in both the building material and the composer Philip – the idea being to reveal its high-tech architecture not only as functional and technical, but also as part of the cultural avant garde of its time. Terms such as “building component” are somehow set to music, while the performer at one point wears a venetian blind. Alongside, behind one of the patterned curtains, are photographs of the house and a spare-lined architectural drawing of its plan. Radical Rooms is an ambitious project in a small space, dense in creation and invention; one that transforms the rather meagre and mediocre gallery in which Riba sees fit to promote the art of architecture. It runs a gamut from abstraction to animation, from diagrams to dancers, leaving the viewer to choose which is background, which is the focus of attention. Like its subject matter, it is a work of collaboration: not only by Holland and Mainstone, but also the composer Jay Malhotra, the technologist Jonathan Hogg, several performers and technicians, and the curator Margaret Cubbage. It is both serious and witty, and brings a smile to the face. It boldly addresses what is usually an absence in architectural exhibitions, by bringing fictionalised versions of the buildings’ makers and users into the room. It approaches its themes subtly, presenting itself as a show about the arrangement of space as much as about the roles of women in architecture. It imposes no conclusions. For all its experiential appeal, it may, it must be said, be a little baffling to those not already in the know. If you’ve never heard of Hardwick or the Hopkins House, you’ll probably want a bit more material as to what they are and why they are important, which is a downside of the exhibition’s determination to approach its subjects from unconventional directions. The upside is that it offers a new and much-needed way of looking at buildings of the past.

5/1/2022,"The release of Trevor Reed, an American prisoner held by Russia, in exchange for a convicted Russian drug smuggler, has shown that Washington and Moscow are still able to negotiate on some issues even after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The exchange on the tarmac of a Turkish airport on Monday morning, has also focused attention on the plight two other Americans left behind in Russian jails, held on flimsy or spurious grounds – most likely as bargaining counters. One is Paul Whelan, a former marine who was arrested in 2018 in a Moscow hotel, where he had gone to attend a friend’s wedding. He was convicted of espionage and sentenced to 16 years hard labour. The other is Brittney Griner, a basketball star who was detained in a Moscow airport on 17 February, a week before the Ukraine invasion, and accused of having cannabis oil in her possession. A court has ordered her held until 19 May, pending investigation. For both, the news of Reed’s release brought mixed emotions: it showed that such deals are possible, but also the regret that they were excluded on this occasion. “As I do everything in my power to get BG home, my heart is overflowing with joy for the Reed family,” Griner’s wife, Cherelle, wrote on Instagram. “I do not personally know them, but I do know the pain of having your loved one detained in a foreign country. That level of pain is constant and can only be remedied by a safe return home. For the Reed family, that day is today.” In a call from a penal colony, Whelan telephoned his parents and asked: “Why was I left behind? “While I am pleased Trevor is home with his family, I have been held on a fictitious charge of espionage for 40 months,” he said, according to his twin brother, David. “The world knows this charge was fabricated. Why hasn’t more been done to secure my release.” Reflecting on the double-edged lessons from Reed’s release, David Whelan said: “It’s a “fog of war” experience. You don’t really have any idea what’s possible, and then with Trevor’s release, you start to get a little bit of clarity that the US government is willing to take certain actions and how they might go about those actions. “The other benefit is that the fact that the exchange happened means that the US and Russian relationship, as damaged as it is, still has enough diplomatic life that they are able to spend a couple of months working out an arrangement like this,” Whelan added. The potential downside for the Whelan and Griner families is that, by exchanging Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison for conspiracy to bring drugs into the US, Washington has traded someone designated as a bargaining counter by Moscow. US press reports of the months of negotiations leading up to the Reed release said that the Russians had insisted on Yaroshenko. Joe Biden said after the exchange that “negotiations that allowed us to bring Trevor home required difficult decisions that I do not take lightly”. According to David Whelan, the Russian officers who oversaw his brother’s detention made clear from early on that they hoped to swap him for Yaroshenko or Viktor Bout. Bout is a notorious Russian arms dealer, nicknamed the “merchant of death”, who was arrested in Thailand in 2008, extradited to the US, and sentenced in 2012 to 25 years for conspiracy to kill US citizens, delivery of anti-aircraft missiles, and providing aid to a terrorist organisation. A source involved in hostage negotiations said that the Reed-Yaroshenko exchange opened the way for a possible swap of Bout for Whelan. “There is often a staggered process in these types of cases that is designed to build confidence,” the source said. “You get him out, they do the trade, everybody sees that it worked, you wait to see what the blowback is, and then you’ve already cut the deal for when the second trade will happen.” David Whelan however, made clear that his family is not pushing for any such deal. “My personal man-on-the-street perspective is that it would be crazy for the US government to exchange the “merchant of death” for Paul, who is, at best, a hapless tourist,” he said. The evidence used against Paul Whelan was a computer flash drive, which the prosecution said contained state secrets, and which he said was used to frame him. He was given the drive by an acquaintance and had assumed it contained just wedding photos. Whelan has now been held for 40 months, the last 20 of which have been in a labour camp in Mordovia, about 300 miles east of Moscow. For the whole of that time, his brother said, he has been roused from sleep every two hours at night and photographed, on the grounds he is a flight risk. The decisive factor in the decision to prioritise Reed and exchange him for Yaroshenko was his failing health. He had been in the same cell as a prisoner with tuberculosis and had been coughing up blood. His family also conducted a high-profile pressure campaign, pressuring the White House to give his parents a public meeting with Biden. The stock advice given to families of kidnap victims used to keep silent during negotiations, but now the hostage-taker is more likely to be a state than a rogue group, the landscape has changed. “Going public is an excellent way to influence states and a really poor way to influence terrorist groups or non-state actors,” said Joel Simon, former head of the Committee to Protect Journalists and author of the 2019 book We Want to Negotiate: The Secret World of Kidnapping, Hostages and Ransom. “So if the key to resolving your hostage crisis is to influence a government, then going public may be the best strategy.” While a few years ago, families would largely find themselves leading a public campaign more or less alone, there is now an expanding group of former hostages willing to help. On Trevor Reed’s release, his family immediately declared they were transferring their efforts to Whelan and Griner. “That wasn’t the case six or seven years ago,” said Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post journalist who has held on trumped-up charges for 544 days by the Iranian authorities. “There’s much more of a community which is the lone silver lining in this whole thing. Because without that community, I don’t think we’re going to solve this problem.”",News/World news,Trevor Reed’s release puts spotlight on other Americans in Russian jail,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/01/trevor-reed-release-paul-whelan-brittney-griner-russia

5/1/2022,"For Priti Patel, the findings of the report on her desk were no doubt unpalatable. Fixated on creating a system that detained and quickly removed asylum seekers, the home secretary would have been shocked to discover that some officials in her department were now enthusing about a “humane” alternative. At precisely the same time as the Home Office was secretly drawing up options for new immigration removal centres, civil servants elsewhere in the department were championing an option that may have rendered such plans redundant. The results of a Home Office scheme in Newcastle, the first government-funded alternative to detention, had been unequivocally successful. Supporting women asylum seekers in the community was found to improve their wellbeing at half the cost of detaining them. Vulnerable women who otherwise would have been incarcerated experienced greater stability and better health. Staff involved in the programme were convinced of its merits. “The Home Office officials who set up the project were really invested in it and felt it worked extremely well as a detention alternative. Sadly, their political masters had less interest,” a source said. Despite approving all the recommendations of the pilot’s evaluation, Patel’s department buried it. When asked why, the Home Office declined to comment. Another trial funded by the Home Office in Bedford, which helps improve the prospects of undocumented migrants while protecting them from detention, is also said to show extremely positive results. Yet it is due to end in June and the concern is that it too will be ignored. Another three government schemes for alternatives to detention have been cancelled. Duncan McAuley, chief executive of charity Action Foundation, which ran the Newcastle trial, said he was “really disappointed” that alternatives were not being pursued despite evidence they were a viable solution. Last week his outlook darkened further. The passing of the contentious Nationality and Borders Act on Wednesday night, critics warn, raises the prospect of more asylum seekers being detained along with more immigration removal centres to house them. Already some believe Patel’s headline-grabbing plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda may prove to be a distraction designed to deflect scrutiny from the rolling out of facilities like that envisaged for a former RAF base at Linton-on-Ouse. And an Observer investigation into the proposed immigration facility in north Yorkshire has uncovered disturbing elements that the government seems to have wanted kept secret. Billed as a reception area, it appears that the Home Office is actually planning to detain an undisclosed number of the approximately 1,500 asylum seekers it intends to house there. An official government fact sheet dated 14 April offers no mention of the potential for individuals to be detained, saying only that asylum seekers will receive a safeguarding call if they are not back by 10pm. But at a community meeting, caught on a video obtained by Liberty Investigates, the local Tory MP Kevin Hollinrake told residents: “There are some people on the site where there will be a detention centre element of it and those people won’t be allowed to leave the detention centre.” Later, when approached by the Observer, Hollinrake confirmed that “they [the Home Office] did mention a detention element to me but didn’t say how many would be in it”. The Home Office responded by saying that “service users” at the facility “will not be detained, however they are expected to be on site overnight”. Another unreported element is the potential involvement of Serco, the outsourcing firm whose staff have been accused of sexual abuse of detainees. Figures from North Yorkshire police and Linton’s parish council have cited the possibility that the site might be run by Serco, a detail also omitted from the government fact sheet. Serco is already contracted to run some of the most controversial immigration removal centres like Brook House outside Gatwick airport where independent observers have recorded a surge in incidents of self-harm and suicide attempts. Serco and the Home Office chose not to comment. The possibility of a detention facility run by a firm with such a controversial record is already causing concern. Lottie Hume, a solicitor at Duncan Lewis, said: “The only reason to have a hybrid detention-accommodation facility is for the Home Office to effect removal at a rate which will erode due process and restrict ability to seek help from others.” Agnes Tonah knows only too well the impact of detention. Ten years after being held in Serco’s notorious Yarl’s Wood immigration centre in Bedford, the experience continues to haunt her. During Tonah’s 90-day incarceration after fleeing war in west Africa, she says her mental health suffered profoundly. She knew another young woman who tried to kill herself because they “couldn’t understand” why they were effectively jailed. “Detention is a prison. It is a traumatising place where people seeking sanctuary find themselves locked up.” Tonah finds it bewildering that the UK government has opted for what she describes as a policy of cruelty. “Why imprison me when I was just asking for safety? Detention harms people.” The passing of the Borders Act promises fresh harm. It is understood the government has an undisclosed list of other potential sites for immigration centres, while a new facility just for women recently opened. Critics of the new facility at Derwentside in County Durham say information from inside is difficult to obtain. What is known is that some women allege they have been denied vital in-person legal advice that campaigners say could impair the chance of a successful case, claims that have resulted in a legal challenge. The Home Office responded saying that face-to-face legal visits “can be facilitated”. The opening of Derwentside remains a blow to advocates of a progressive asylum system. When it opened its doors after Christmas, the number of women in UK immigration detention stood at a historic low of 24. Within weeks the results of the Newcastle alternative to detention scheme were discussed in the Home Office, then put aside. It marks a long fall from 2015 when the then home secretary, Theresa May, urged a review that concluded ministers should reduce “boldly and without delay” detention numbers along with a “presumption against detention” of victims of rape and sexual violence and those suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. A close working relationship was fostered with the United Nations to find a solution to detention, resulting in a Home Office and UNHCR working group on the issue, which first met in October 2017. Such enlightened ambitions have been flattened by Patel. Celebrating the passing of its divisive bill on Thursday, the Home Office confirmed a key focus was “the removal of those with no right to be in the UK”. McAuley said: “As the passing of the bill clearly indicates, this government is clearly committed to a more costly, less effective and inhumane approach to immigration management.” In Linton-on-Ouse, locals fear life may never be the same. There is talk of resorting to extreme tactics like those used by Extinction Rebellion activists, such as gluing themselves to fences and roads. “Right now, nothing’s off the table. People are becoming quite desperate,” said Marc Goddard, a parish councillor. He likens the plans to the flooding of another north Yorkshire village, West End, which was submerged in the 1960s to make way for a reservoir supplying Leeds with drinking water. “It feels like that’s what’s happening to this village. We’re collateral damage, sacrificed, to simply quench the inadequacies of a truly incompetent Home Office,” said Goddard.",News/UK news,‘We’re collateral damage’: fury in Yorkshire village at its role in migrant detention plan,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/01/were-collateral-damage-fury-in-yorkshire-village-at-its-role-in-migrant-detention-plan
5/1/2022,"As Trump’s big lie of a stolen election began ricocheting across America in November 2020, Arizona’s Republican attorney general, Mark Brnovich (pronounced “Burn-o-vich”), spoke out forcefully on national television. He told the public that Donald Trump was projected to lose the swing state, and “no facts” suggested otherwise. (At the time I thought to myself, “Good for him. Maybe more Republican attorneys general will show some spine.”) That was then. Recently, Brnovich – now running for US Senate from Arizona – came on to Steve Bannon’s far-right podcast with the opposite message: Brnovich said he was “investigating” the 2020 vote and had “serious concerns”. He went on: “It’s frustrating for all of us, because I think we all know what happened in 2020,” without explaining what he meant by “what happened.” (Bannon titled the podcast segment “AZ AG On Interim Report On Stealing The 2020 Election.”) It would be bad enough were Brnovich the exception. But he exemplifies what’s happened to the Republican party over the last 19 months. Republican politicians who initially told the truth have since then embraced Trump’s big lie in order to gain Trump’s favor (or avoid his wrath) in their 2022 races. (Brnovich launched his “review” of the 2020 vote in Arizona in response to a widely ridiculed “audit” commissioned by Arizona Republican lawmakers.) It’s the same story with JD Vance, Republican candidate for the Senate from Ohio, who initially told the truth about the 2020 election but then pushed Trump’s lie to curry favor with Trump – and was rewarded last week with Trump’s endorsement and $10m in campaign funds from rightwing billionaire Peter Thiel. It’s the same with the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, who held on to his scruples for a few minutes after the January 6 insurrection – when he publicly criticized Trump and told House colleagues he’d urge Trump to resign – but then promptly did a 180 and traveled to Mar-a-Lago to display his total loyalty to Trump, even bestowing on his madness a jar of his favorite pink- and red-flavored Starbursts. (McCarthy has denied ever telling his colleagues he’d urge Trump to resign but was caught on tape doing just that.) And the same for the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, who initially condemned Trump. Early in the morning of 7 January McConnell told the New York Times reporter Jonathan Martin (according to an excerpt released this week from Martin’s and fellow reporter Alexander Burns’s forthcoming book): “I feel exhilarated by the fact that this fellow [Trump] finally, totally discredited himself. He put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger,” adding, “Couldn’t have happened at a better time.” McConnell vowed to crush the extremist “sons of bitches … in the primary in 22”. And now? McConnell won’t utter a negative word about Trump – or about those extremist “sons of bitches”. Up and down the ranks of the Republican party, the new litmus test for gaining dollars, votes, and the coveted Trump endorsement is to embrace the big lie that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. For the rest of us – and for posterity – it should be a negative litmus test for politicians to place ambition over principle, narcissism over duty, and cowardice over conscience. How are Republican voters ever to know the truth when these toadies, sycophants, and unprincipled pawns repeat and amplify Trump’s lie? Fully 85% of Republicans now believe it (35% of Americans overall believe it). The Republican party now stands for little more than the big lie – not for fiscal prudence or smaller government or stronger defense, not for state’s rights or religious freedom or even anti-abortion, but for a pernicious deception. The lie is now the life of the Republican party. How can what was once a noble party – the party of Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt – descend to such putrid depths, sowing distrust in our electoral system and in the peaceful transition of power that’s at the heart of democracy? The real question – more in the realm of social psychology than political science – is how one profoundly sick, pathologically narcissistic man, who is obsessed with never losing, has been able to impose his obsession on one of America’s two political parties? Which raises an even more troubling question: How can American democracy ever function when almost all Republican politicians are willing to sell out their oaths to the US constitution in order to kiss the derrière of this demented man? Why are no more than a handful of Republican politicians, such as Representative Liz Cheney, willing stand up to this monstrosity? This is how fascism begins.

5/1/2022,"The novelist Maggie O’Farrell will travel to Stratford-upon-Avon next weekend bearing two branches of rosemary cut from her own garden. A plant traditionally associated with remembrance, as Ophelia notes in Hamlet, its flowering sprigs will be laid on the ground as tributes to Shakespeare’s twin children, Judith and Hamnet. For centuries, they have had no visible memorial in the town where they lived and died. But all that changes on Saturday morning when two rowan trees will be planted in the graveyard of Stratford’s Holy Trinity church to mark their very different lives. O’Farrell will then place her gift of rosemary at the foot of each tree. “I am so thrilled because I have been working towards this for years,” said O’Farrell, whose book about the family, Hamnet, won the Women’s prize for fiction in 2020. “Hamnet’s rowan, or mountain ash, will have red gold berries in the autumn, while Judith’s will be pinky white, so they are similar but not the same, just as they would have been.” Working together with Annie Ashworth of the Stratford Literary Festival and with the vicar and church wardens of Holy Trinity, where Shakespeare himself is buried, the trees will help tell the full story of a family with global significance. Hamnet, whose name was also written as Hamlet, died suddenly at the age of 11 in 1596, and the loss, O’Farrell believes, shaped Shakespeare’s later creative sensibility. Her own work of fiction tells the speculative story of the family’s bereavement. “I’m amazed really that people have debated about whether or not Shakespeare was grieving and whether the death affected his work. Of course it did. It’s baffling to me that people haven’t thought more about his importance, particularly when the spelling of his name and the title of his most famous play were interchangeable,” she told the Observer. The idea of marking Hamnet’s short life came to her when she first visited the church in 2017 to research her novel. “It was seeded for me when I asked the person in charge of the graveyard where the grave was. ‘We don’t know,’ they said, although they have a record of his burial. It seemed emblematic to me, as Hamnet was consigned to literary footnotes and overlooked. Nobody has ever given him his due.” As O’Farrell read the ink line that registered Hamnet’s burial, she vowed to organise a memorial, later realising that Judith also had no memorial. Although she is to give a talk about her novel at the literary festival this Friday, she deliberately wants to keep Saturday’s ceremony distinct from her fictional account. “I wanted to do it separately, because this event is about the real Hamnet, not the person imagined in my book. This is absolutely about the real boy,” she explained. The task of getting permission fell largely to Ashworth, and O’Farrell said it would not have been possible without the help of the town. “I discovered that you can’t have a gravestone without a burial, so a tree and a plaque for each of them seemed the right thing,” she said. Judith Shakespeare, who is a central character in Ben Elton and Kenneth Branagh’s 2018 film All Is True, lived a long life and is rumoured to have been buried in a pauper’s grave. “We are not sure, but she certainly had a hard time. She lived to 67, which was a very good age since the average expectancy was about 47 years then. “It was a full, tough life though, because she buried a husband and three sons, as well as her brother Hamnet. I like to think she lived for herself and for him.” Speeches in the graveyard from the vicar and from O’Farrell will be followed by readings from two of Shakespeare’s plays; passages chosen for the occasion by the novelist and read by the Royal Shakespeare Company actor Hannah Young. “For Hamnet, I’ve chosen Constance’s speech from King John, where she talks about her dead son,” said O’Farrell. “I’ve always believed it was clearly about Hamnet. And then, for Judith, I have selected lines from A Midsummer Night’s Dream which are about twins, a constant theme in his plays.” The tone of the ceremony, the author expects, will be bittersweet: “We are honouring a child who died aged 11, but we are also happy to be paying them both tribute. They won’t be forgotten.”",Arts/Culture,Shakespeare’s tragic twins memorialised in the Bard’s resting place,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/01/shakespeares-tragic-twins-memorialised-in-the-bards-resting-place
5/1/2022,"The somnolent peace of the congregation in my local was rudely disturbed last week by a couple of strangers. Eager young types, all sharp suits and loud voices, they were prattling away, quite unconcerned by their intrusion, until one said, “We elaborate going forwards”, and the other said, “Well, that’s the point of successful marketing.” Only when everyone started laughing uproariously did they feel a modicum of shame and have the decency to continue sotto voce. Marketing indeed. Also last week, I noticed the law firm Clifford Chance is reported to be considering appointing a “chief happiness officer” to ensure the firm is “the most vibrant, happy and uplifting place to work in the world”. I’d love to see the job description. You’d have to be a combination of Ken Dodd, the Marx Brothers and Tommy Cooper to be in with even a sniff of a chance and it smacks of all those other grandiose titles – “beverage dissemination manager” (bartender), “wizard of lightbulb moments” (marketing manager) – that cause such amusement to real people. And what to make of Google’s new tool, an “inclusive language function”, which will flash up warnings if writers use words that “may not be inclusive to all readers” and will suggest alternatives. Among those that would fall foul of this device, it was reported, are John F Kennedy’s inaugural address, Jesus’s Sermon on the Mount and Martin Luther King - not “fierce urgency”, but “intense urgency”. Why? A Google bod explained: “Our technology is always improving and we don’t yet… have a complete solution to identifying and mitigating all unwanted word associations and biases.” For heaven’s sake, Google is only a bloody search engine, not judge and jury on “all that is correct”.

5/1/2022,"After Covid, comfort in the stalls. That, at any rate, was last year’s favourite theory: that post-pandemic theatre, seeking security by turning to familiar musicals and plays, was likely to go tepid. Here is a week that proves the conclusion wrong. Two revivals – one restaging of a brilliant 13-year-old production, one complete remaking of an 82-year-old play – are both in turn rousing and disturbing. Both are unmissable. Jez Butterworth’s Jerusalem first burst into the Royal Court in 2009, bringing a luscious roll of language, a group of wayward spirits new to the stage and a 3D sensuality (smells reeked off the boards). Mark Rylance’s performance as Johnny “Rooster” Byron proved to be one of the most magnificent acting events of the past 20 years. Centring on a caravan dweller/drug dealer/free spirit and his followers – disapproved of, opposed and eventually set upon by the residents of a local estate and the council – the play swings beautifully, painfully between celebration and lament. Today its hedonism is more strongly laced with alarm. Director Ian Rickson preserves his original staging without embalming it. Ultz’s design features the same glade, in which the action buzzes but the air seems still, and where, thanks to thoughtful lighting by Mimi Jordan Sherin, it is sometimes hard to know whether the glow is fading or growing. Certain references – among them a joke about “Spooky Spice” – make it a striking portrait of its time. Other aspects have accrued a grimmer, sadder tinge. In the post-Brexit age of refugees, the lad from the abattoir who considers anyone outside Wiltshire a foreigner becomes a more significant figure. In a post-#MeToo world the young girls who flit around snorting and flirting look more obviously threatened. Mackenzie Crook is again subtly wistful as the perpetually disappointed would-be DJ, playing with the zip of his jacket as if it were an instrument. Indra Ové is particularly memorable as Rooster’s former lover, Dawn, caught between hardness and melting. Still, it is Rylance who makes this a St Crispin’s Day moment: think yourself accursed you were not there. His combination of physicality and verbal nimbleness is unique. He does a headstand into a water trough, flicks a firelighter like a juggling toy, suggests his roosterishness with winglike elbows. He delivers with ardour his magic and bonkersness: this is the man who, just down the road from a Little Chef, came across the giant who built Stonehenge. A master of the pause and apparent stumble, his words bubble up from a blur of hesitation and chaos, flaming into life against a dark background, like the play itself. Everything about The Corn Is Green is right, for the National and the nation. Not green but ripe for this moment. Emlyn Williams’s 1938 play shows the UK as the divided country it still is. It stars a schoolteacher: when has the need for learning seemed more pressing? That schoolteacher is an unmarried woman: the stage – as hinted at in Scandaltown last month – is waking up to the fact that not all women without husbands have wasted lives. Dominic Cooke’s production rewires the drama so that its historical importance is shown, its autobiographical element made vivid, its currency made vivacious. At the centre, Nicola Walker – she of The Split and Unforgotten – plays the teacher, Miss Moffat: Williams, a tremendous phrase-maker, described the real-life character on which she was based as having “eyes like a boxer smacking a punch-ball”. Walker catches that exactly: never tremulous nor trembling but quickening to everything around her (though, having, it turns out, a blind spot). Arriving in a Welsh village, Miss Moffat finds that 10-year-old boys, working down the pit, cannot read or write. They are Welsh speakers: we might as well be in a foreign country, grumbles one of the local toffs. She takes up a particularly gifted boy – an essay in which he talks of reaching out of the darkness of the mine gives its title to the play. She teaches him Greek, she enters him for Oxford, she takes him away from his old life. This is a story full of feeling, verging on the sentimental, and one that in its later stages has several unlikely plot twists. But it is not psychologically blunt – Williams knew about the dangers of saviourism – and Cooke rescues it from its difficulties by a great wheeze. A man in a tux circles the evening, coming from glitter and ballroom, sinking back into memory: the playwright is constructing the play in front of our eyes, delivering stage directions and once stopping the action to rerun it. It is a device that gives edge to the sometimes soft focus and to period-piece characters such as the stuffed-shirt squire. It also brings home the fact that this is the playwright’s own story: Williams himself starred in the first production. Circling the stage a male voice choir, singers dressed as miners, tugs at the heart. One of the subtleties of Cooke’s production is that the men sing not the boisterous Men of Harlech (as in the Bette Davis movie of The Corn Is Green) but Calon Lân, the song that wishes for a pure heart. They light up the stalls. Jackie Sibblies Drury’s new play Marys Seacole also seeks to show how past and present are fused: in this case by racism and misogyny, which runs down through generations. Drury is a true playwright: her 2019 play Fairview plunged audiences into disarray with a tremendous coup de theatre, confronting the spectators with their own expectations about black and white characters. She has a magnetic subject in Mary Seacole, the pioneering nurse sometimes dubiously called “the black Florence Nightingale” (why not the other way round?). Nadia Latif’s production has in Kayla Meikle an actor who burns steadily – bold and visionary in a series of incarnations. Marys Seacole is a string of impassioned fragments in which Seacole is imagined as a succession of Marys: the historic figure in starched black robe and lace cuffs, being patronised by Nightingale, and as her blue-uniformed, latter-day NHS counterpart, treated with casual condescension by white visitors. Despite vivid flashes – in particular, the reconstruction of a practice emergency response to a terrorist incident – the play is often sluggishly overexplicit. There is fizzingly dextrous acting from Esther Smith and Olivia Williams, playing a multiplicity of roles. Still, the century-leaping scenes, topped and tailed by long, explanatory speeches at the beginning and end of the evening, reinforce rather than inflect each other. The central brutal statement by a black character, looking towards England, has been proved true: “Them need us but them no want us.” It deserves a better play.
