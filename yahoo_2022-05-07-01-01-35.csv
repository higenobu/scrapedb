5/7/2022,"So far, 2022 has been a pretty rough year for investors, with the S&P index tumbling 10%. But as the famous contrarian investor Nathan Rothschild once said, the best time to buy is when there is “blood on the streets."" However, with so many names on the backfoot, the question is which ones are poised to rebound? And here it could work in an investor’s favor to track the behavior of companies’ C-suite members. To ensure a level playing field, company insiders are obliged to report their transactions, and if an insider is seen picking up shares after a continued decline, it's often a sign that the stock offers good value at its current price. With this in mind, using the TipRanks’ Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool, we noticed that insiders have been loading up on shares of two stocks which have taken a sound beating in recent times. Let’s find out why these people in the know are confident now is the time to make a move on these names. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) Disney might be the category leader in entertainment but second only to the House of Mouse is heavyweight media company Warner Bros. Discovery. The giant is the result of a merger between Discovery and WarnerMedia, after it was spun off by AT&T last month. With over 200,000 hours of programming, some of the most iconic franchises in the entertainment world - DC Comics, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Friends – the company is a global powerhouse boasting a foothold in more than 200 countries. The company’s networks include CNN, Animal Planet, Discovery Channel, Cartoon Network, Food Network, TNT and Travel Channel, to name a few. This new media company will bring together HBO Max and Discovery+, which together serve nearly 100 million paid subscribers. Armed with its troves of content, the new media giant is banking on the streaming opportunity as consumers move away from linear TV to CTV. Even so, the big story in the steaming universe over the past month has been Netflix’ earnings disaster which also managed to drag down all other streaming names while WBD’s messy showing hasn’t helped either; the shares have shed 21% of their value since the merger – and it appears like the insiders have been taking note. The past week or so has seen no less than 7 different insiders buying. CEO David Zaslav picked up 50,200 shares for $1,000,398, director Robert Bennett bought 50,300 shares for $1,000,490, while CFO Wiedenfels Gunnar spent 572,590 buying up 29,00 shares in the company, to name a few. It’s not only the insiders who believe the stock is cheap. Evercore analyst Vijay Jayant says the shares are “undervalued” and notes that WBD is the “cheapest media company on levered free cash flow yield (14%) and the second cheapest on EV/EBITDA (7.9x).” Furthermore, it is its positioning in the streaming segment which offers much promise. “We believe the combination of HBO Max and discovery+ into a single service will be highly synergistic. HBO Max will bring the expensive, flashy originals needed to acquire customers, while discovery+’s unscripted content provides the large library of content needed to retain those customers. We expect the company to grow its streaming revenues at a 21% CAGR from ’21-‘26, in line with our expectations for Disney. Revenue growth will moderate in ‘22 before reaccelerating in ‘23 with the launch of a consolidated DTC product in Q1 ‘23 followed by a ramp up of international launches,"" Jayant opined. To this end, Jayant rates WBD an Outperform (i.e. Buy), while his $40 price target suggests shares will add 120% over the one-year timeframe. (To watch Jayant’s track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, the ratings are mixed but tilting in the bulls’ favor; the stock’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 6 Buys, 4 Holds and 1 Sell. Meanwhile, according to the $35.67 average price target, the Street expects shares to climb ~81% from current levels. (See WBD stock forecast on TipRanks) Lam Research (LRCX) Semiconductors are an essential component in much of today’s tech and many chip companies make their products using Lam Research's wafer fabrication equipment (WFE). The company takes pride in its ubiquity, claiming that today, “nearly every advanced chip is built with Lam technology.” Maybe so, but in a macro climate where supply chain and Covid-related issues have persisted, Lam has suffered too. In the latest quarterly report, for F3Q22, revenue increased by 5.5% year-over-year to reach $4.06 billion, falling short of the consensus estimate by $180 million. Adj. EPS of $7.40 also missed the Street’s call - by $0.11. Making matters worse, for FQ4 the company is expecting revenue of $4.2 billion and adjusted EPS of $7.25, while Wall Street was hoping for $4.45 billion and $8.23, respectively. Sliding 30% since January’s peak, one board member sees better days ahead for LRCX. Director Catherine Lego has decided to take advantage of the depressed price and last week picked up 1,736 shares for a total of $799,168. While Stifel analyst Patrick Ho notes the above issues are expected to remain a “significant headwind in the near term,” they do little to dissuade him Lam is a company worth getting behind. “Management was firm in noting demand trends had not changed one bit and reiterated its 2022 WFE of approximately $100B. We strongly support this sentiment and believe these trends will carry into 2023 as well. With that in mind, we are not making many changes to our forecasts for CY22, FY23 (June) or CY23. With this fundamental stance, we believe valuations are very attractive,” Ho explained. It's a Buy, then, from Ho who has an $837 price target for the shares. The implication for investors? Potential upside of ~65%. (To watch Ho’s track record, click here) So, that’s Stifel's view, how does the rest of the Street see the next 12 months panning out for LRCX? Based on 12 Buys and 7 Holds, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Moderate Buy. With a return potential of ~25%, the stock's consensus target price stands at $632.94.

5/7/2022,"So much for the Federal Reserve being the friend of the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1,000 points on Thursday as traders reassessed what Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at his post-decision press conference yesterday. A perception of a less hawkish Powell was embraced by the markets on Wednesday afternoon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 932.27 points and the S&P 500 gained 2.99%, which were the largest gains for the two indices since 2000. Even the beaten-up Nasdaq Composite popped 3.19%. It now appears that after a few hours of deep thought, traders have formed a more lasting near-term view that the Fed is far from dovish, has let inflation get out of control, and is still poised to dramatically slow down the economy through a series of 50 basis point rate increases. ""Inflation is still going to be a major problem throughout the rest of this year and beyond,"" Miller Tabak Chief Markets Strategist Matt Maley said. Selling pressure today was widespread and in some cases severe. The Nasdaq Composite plunged nearly 5% by early afternoon trading. Small-cap stocks — as measured by the Russell 2000 — dropped more than 4%. E-commerce companies such as eBay, Etsy, Shopify, and Fastly were hammered amid the one-two punch of broader market pressure and lackluster earnings. Wall Street pros think the selling could continue in the short term on fears of a sharp, Fed-driven growth slowdown as it catches up on rate increases. ""It is much too soon in economic space for the Fed to allow financial conditions to ease very substantially on a sustained basis again, as this would work against the needed cooling of economic activity required to bring inflation under control,"" warned EvercoreISI strategist Krishna Guhu. ""So if the broad easing on the day across the dollar, equities, rates, and credit continues to rip in the days or even weeks ahead, the Fed will likely have to find a way to rein it in.""

5/7/2022,"Just when it looked like time to throw in the towel, the market pulled through and delivered a win. After April turned out to be the worst month since March 2020, May kicked off in a more upbeat fashion, with investors hoping the bottom might be in sight. Whether that is the case or not, remains to be determined, although the one good thing about a bear market is that investors have plenty of opportunities to pick up promising equities at enticing prices. But how to get hold of the next winner? One route is to follow the lead of analysts at banking giants such as Goldman Sachs. We dived into the TipRanks’ database to get the lowdown on two names the firm’s stock analysts see as primed for lift off – even in the current risk-off environment. These are names which Goldman’s stock pickers see surging by at least 70%; they also happen to be rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. Let’s take a look at why the banking firm finds these names so appealing right now. Insmed (INSM) The holy grail for investors might be a multibagger but for a biotech company it is to get one of its candidates across the finish line, a feat already achieved by Insmed, a company focused on the development of drugs for rare diseases. Back in 2018, Insmed has gained FDA approval for its lung disease drug Arikayce. In 2021, Arikayce generated net sales of $159.5 million in the U.S., but also brought in $16 million from Japan following July’s launch, while in Europe, Arikayce has now hit the shelves in Germany, the Netherlands, Wales, and Scotland. Arikayce might already be generating meaningful revenue, but the pipeline has various other drugs in development. Enrollment for the Phase 3 ASPEN study testing brensocatib in patients with bronchiectasis is now taking place while the Phase 2 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study of brensocatib in patients with cystic fibrosis is underway; Insmed expects to have a data readout from this study by early next year. The company is also moving forward with two Phase 2 studies of treprostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP), indicated to treat patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). It is a combination of appealing valuation, commercial viability, a strong pipeline and additional opportunities which have Goldman Sachs' Andrea Tan in a bullish mood. “With INSM trading near its commercial base business (~$20/share), we see the name as attractive at current levels, noting strong commercial execution spurred by favorable COVID and idiosyncratic tailwinds for FY22 Arikayce sales (30%+ YoY growth) and pipeline catalysts to serve as inflection points and unlock pipeline value. Separately, INSM’s fourth pillar dedicated to translational medicine will be unveiled at the upcoming R&D day in 2H22 where the goal of 1 IND/year (first one in gene therapy by YE22) is designed to deliver long-term growth across multiple indications,” Tan wrote. All of the above convinced Tan to rate INSM a Buy. In addition to the call, she set a $56 price target, suggesting a hefty 145% upside potential. (To watch Tan’s track record, click here) Overall, the Street is unanimously on board here; the stock has garnered 7 analyst reviews over the past 3 months, and all are positive, making the consensus view a Strong Buy. There’s a bullish average target too; at $50, the figure implies shares will appreciate ~119% in the year ahead. (See INSM stock forecast on TipRanks) 2seventy bio (TSVT) We’ll stay in the biotech neighborhood for the next stock. 2seventy bio takes its moniker from the “maximum speed of translating human thought into action,” which happens at 270 miles per hour. The cell and gene therapy company aims to outpace cancer and came into being after bluebird bio spun off its severe genetic disease business from its oncology segment. The company boasts a commercial asset, Abecma, which was developed in partnership with Bristol Myers. The drug gained FDA approval in March 2021, making it the first approved cell-based gene therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Bristol Myers reported that Abecma revenues hit $158 million last year, and the two companies equally split all profits and losses related to the drug in the US. 2seventy expects total U.S. Abecma revenues will come in the $250-$300 million range in 2022, with the company recently stating it is on track to reach the “high end of the range,” driven by a meaningful patient backlog and strong demand. The company’s pipeline boasts 5 programs in IND-enabling preclinical studies, but two other assets have already advanced to clinical studies; bbT369 is a dual targeted (CD20 and CD79a) CAR T-cell therapy in a Phase 1 study indicated for the treatment of B-non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and SC-DARIC33, an investigational, potentially first-in-class CD33-targeting CAR T for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia is also in Phase 1 testing. Initial data is anticipated for both in 2H22 and proof of concept (PoC) clinical data should be available in 2023. Goldman Sachs' Salveen Richter is “constructive” on these novel engineered lead clinical-stage assets and is upbeat regarding Abecma’s commercial prospects. “In our view, TSVT’s core value proposition is supported by Abecma, which represents a base business of ~$12/share, and centers on the pipeline where we note innovative science layering multiple technologies. Abecma has demonstrated a promising early launch where demand has outpaced supply. We monitor industry-wide supply constraints for lentiviral vectors, but view the 2022 US sales guidance of $250mn-$300mn as achievable,” Richter noted. To this end, Richter rates TSVT shares a Buy and has a $26 price target for the shares. The implication for investors? Upside of ~72%. (To watch Richter’s track record, click here) Two other analysts have recently chimed in with TSVT reviews and they back Richter’s positive stance, providing this stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. Their price projections are even more bullish than the Goldman analyst will allow; at $34.67, the figure suggests shares will rise 129% over the one-year timeframe.

5/7/2022,"The world is in the midst of an acute energy crisis. The fact that a barrel of crude oil traded below $0 in early 2020 is now a distant memory. Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate are both comfortably above $100. There's a chance oil could stay above $100 for the rest of 2022 due to three things: Demand, supply, and production. Demand for crude oil is rebounding as the global economy recovers — people are traveling and commuting again. Meanwhile, production has failed to meet that demand because producers have underinvested for nearly a decade. On top of that, sanctions on Russia have cut supply from one of the world’s largest energy exporters. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs even called for oil prices to continue rising above $100 in 2023. Here are three top oil stocks that benefit from those dynamics. Investment legend and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett recently revealed a massive stake in Chevron. In fact, the oil and gas gorilla is now Berkshire’s fourth-largest publicly traded holding. Chevron is at the forefront of the energy boom. In 2021, it produced a total of over 1.8 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids per day. Meanwhile, the company’s free cash flow has surged by more than 1,000% to $21.1 billion over the past year. Currently, the stock trades at a price-to-cash flow ratio of 10. It also offers a healthy 3.5% dividend yield. Occidental Petroleum is another big energy bet in Buffett’s portfolio. The Oracle of Omaha added this new position at the start of 2022. Year to date, the stock is up about 97%, so it has worked out well for the billionaire. Occidental is the largest acreage holder in the highly coveted Permian Basin, with assets concentrated in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico. The company generates a healthy amount of free cash flow — $9.2 billion in 2021 — much of which gets handed back to investors in the form of dividends and buybacks. OXY has already initiated a $2.5 billion buyback program to reward long-term shareholders. Currently, the stock trades at a still-cheapish price-to-cash flow of 5. Exxon Mobil is probably the best-known oil stock in the world — for good reason. As one of the largest energy producers in the world (and biggest in the U.S.), Exxon is the definition of a blue-chip giant. In 2021, Exxon earned $23 billion and generated a whopping $48 billion in operating cash flow. Management also recently initiated a $10 billion share repurchase program. The stock currently trades at a price-to-free cash flow ratio of 7. Meanwhile, Exxon’s dividend yield still sits at an attractive 4.1%. Investors looking for a solid way to lock in some passive income, while hedging against white-hot inflation, might want to keep an eye on XOM.

5/7/2022,"Russian oil production is falling. In March, it shed half a million bpd, which by the end of April reached a full 1 million bpd, according to BP’s CEO, Bernard Looney. And this may well grow to 2 million bpd this month. These barrels may not be returning to the market any time soon. As the European Union targeted a barrage of sanctions on Moscow, oil was excluded as a direct target but financial and maritime sanctions affected the industry. Now, the EU is proposing a full oil embargo, save for a handful of member states too dependent on Russian oil to comply, and this will mean a further loss of barrels at a time when the global oil market is already stretched thin. ""We could potentially see the loss of more than 7 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil and other liquids exports, resulting from current and future sanctions or other voluntary actions,"" the secretary-general of OPEC, Mohammed Barkindo, told the European Union last month. This does not appear to have made any lasting impression on the decision-makers in Brussels, who are moving full steam ahead with the oil embargo. Meanwhile, alternative suppliers would struggle to fill the void left by Russian oil. Russia expects it could lose some 17% of its pre-war oil production this year, Reuters reported last month, citing a document from the country’s economy ministry. The report noted this would be the biggest production drop since the 1990s—a tumultuous time for Russia following the breakup of the Soviet Union. That would be close to 2 million bpd—a figure similar to Looney’s forecast and also to a forecast made by Rystad Energy about lost Russian oil production between 2021 and 2030. If the Rystad projections are right, the fallout from the EU oil embargo would be limited and most Russian production will simply be redirected as it already is. If, however, production declines more, this could see international prices spike much higher. When European buyers started refusing to accept Russian oil cargoes, those cargoes had to return home to be stored somewhere. According to local reports, however, storage space is limited, and this has probably forced the idling of some wells, which if idled, can see their ability to produce in the future affected. Related: Upstream Oil Industry To See Highest Profits Ever In 2022 But there is also danger ahead for Russia’s future production. This may also not materialize as previously planned because of the exit of Big Oil majors from the country, Dan Dicker, host of The Energy Word, told Yahoo Finance earlier this week. Their exit, combined with financial sanctions on Russian banks, will make developing new resources in eastern Siberia more challenging. Meanwhile, OPEC is producing less, rather than more, oil, and U.S. producers are under fire from legislators for alleged profiteering from the oil price rally and struggling with shortages of materials, equipment, and workforce. U.S. oil production will rise by only 800,000 bpd this year, according to the Energy Information Administration’s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook. That’s not good news for America’s European partners. It’s not good news for Americans, either, because it means prices will likely remain high. Except for OPEC and the United States, there are few producers large enough to spare oil for Europe, if any. Brazil is expanding its oil production but its total stands at around 3 million bpd, which is what the EU was importing from Russia before the war in Ukraine began. That leaves the Central Asian producers, who are parties to the OPEC+ agreement and firmly within the Russian sphere of influence, too. What all this means is that with the loss of 2 million bpd of Russian production, a lot of the world is in for prolonged oil price pain, which means all-price pain as well. The beneficiaries are China and India, who are buying Russian crude at a discount, with no logical reason for them to stop, despite threats from Washington. But Russia’s oil production could still fall by more than 2 million bpd. “Europe’s dependence on Russian energy has been a deliberate and decades-long and mutually beneficial relationship. In this early phase of sanctions and embargoes, Russia will benefit as higher prices mean tax revenues are significantly higher than in recent years,” said Daria Melnik, senior analyst at Rystad Energy. “Pivoting exports to Asia will take time and massive infrastructure investments that in the medium term will see Russia’s production and revenues drop precipitously,” she added. With most producers constrained in their capacity to boost production fast, should this scenario play out, oil could become a lot more expensive with little in the way of downside pressure, including electric vehicles. Electric vehicles are about to experience a shortage of batteries and still higher prices. There are some really interesting times ahead.

5/7/2022,"Flat roll steel producer Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (CLF) is pulling back after doubling in price in less than two months, nearing support that could offer a low risk buying opportunity. Spot steel prices fell from $1,700 in Q4 2021 to $1,200 in Q1 2022 but CLF’s specialized products commanded higher prices, highlighting a market edge that could persist for many years. Ukraine and record inflation are acting as tailwinds in this phenomenon, predicting that CLF will trade at much higher levels in coming months. The company is expected to generate record 2022 cash flow, lifting from $2.1 billion in 2021 to around $2.9 billion this year. The stock trades at just five times free cash flow and five times estimated 2022 earnings-per-share (EPS), making it a far cheaper bet than mid-sized tech stocks crashing to earth this year. Better yet, Cleveland-Cliffs’ current price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is lower than the 7x average of the last few years, limiting secular risk. CEO Lourenco Goncalves touted record first quarter results after the April report, trying to ease chronic investor skepticism. As he notes “Our first-quarter results are a clear indication of the success we have been able to achieve as we renewed our fixed-price contracts last year. Despite the decline in spot prices for steel from Q4 to Q1 and its lagged impact on our results, we were able to continue to deliver strong profitability.” Wall Street consensus stands at an ‘Overweight’ rating based upon 6 ‘Buy’ and 5 ‘Hold’ recommendations. The lack of analyst coverage illustrates long-term apathy for the steel sector after a multi-decade downturn. Price targets currently range from a low of $23.50 to a Street-high $47 while the stock is set to open Thursday’s session just $3 above the low target. This modest placement, taken together with the excellent technical outlook, suggests significant upside in coming quarters. Cleveland-Cliffs fell to a 29-year low in 2016 and turned higher, entering an uptrend that stalled in the lower teens in 2017. It posted a higher low in March 2020, ahead of a breakout that settled in the mid-20s in the summer of 2021. The stock rallied above resistance in March 2022, reaching a 9-year high at 34.04 before entering a pullback that’s now approaching breakout support. Weekly Stochastics has reached the oversold level while the monthly indicator remains in a buy cycle, setting up an ideal combination for buy-the-dip strategy, ahead of new upside.

5/7/2022,"The Fed moved to increase interest rates by half a percentage point on Wednesday. This is the biggest increase in two decades, but it's in line with the path that many financial experts and economists predicted the central bank would take. Implementing the rate hikes is an effort to stabilize runaway inflation, the annual rate of which rose by 8.5% in March. As the Fed raises interest rates, it's expected that will gradually slow down consumer demand and decrease pressure on prices. While this should be a good thing long term, it can also leave many people wondering what to do with their money when things are so uncertain. Rate hikes can create volatility in the stock market and push up interest rates on mortgages, car loans, and credit cards. So sometimes the best move you can make is to be patient, says Thomas Kopelman, financial planner and cofounder of Kansas-based AllStreet Wealth. Especially when things are not within your control. “As humans, we worry about everything and we want to control everything,"" Kopelman says. ""There's nothing that we can control about how interest rates are going to be changing."" Rate hikes like this are far more likely to impact older Americans closer to retirement age (or those already in retirement) than younger investors who typically have a longer timeline to save for their future. For investors who are looking for advice in light of the Fed rate hikes, here are some recommendations that financial planners are giving their clients right now. Investing in ​​Series I savings bonds, known as I bonds, right now is a “gimme,” says Patrick Beagle, a certified financial planner (CFP) and owner of Virginia-based WealthCrest Financial Services. That’s due in part to the fact that the I bonds will pay 9.62% interest through October. Beagle, who has more than 20 years of experience, says he’s never recommended government bonds before, but last week he sent an email blast to all of his clients suggesting they buy them. There are some restrictions with I bonds, including that the maximum purchase is $10,000 per year per person (although investors can use their tax refund to buy an additional $5,000 per year), and you must hold the bond for five years to lock in all the interest. If you sell an I bond after less than a year, you forfeit three months of interest. But even with these caveats, Beagle says it’s a deal. “So I hold it a year, big deal,” he tells Fortune. At minimum, investors will earn 9.62% interest for the six months. And then even if the interest rates go down to, say, 4% over the next six months, the average is still way more than any bank account or short-term CD can do. “Would I do that with all the money in my cash reserve? Absolutely not. But between short-term bonds or CDs or I bonds, I would default to I bonds,” Beagle says, adding that he’s invested in these himself. With Wednesday’s rate hike—and several more expected throughout the year—mortgage rates will continue to ramp up. After the first rate hike in April, 30-year mortgages quickly crossed the 5% line, hitting 5.37% last week. Rate increases like that could significantly impact homebuyers’ plans. “If you are applying for a fixed rate mortgage, you should probably lock in your rate as soon as possible,” says ​​David Mendels, director of planning at New York City–based ​​Creative Financial Concepts. But don’t just rush into a decision, says Kopelman. If you are considering moving or buying a home for the first time—or really any purchase where you're going to have to finance it—you need to approach that carefully. Those who currently have a $500,000 house and refinanced it so they’re paying only a 2.5% interest rate are in good shape. But if they move and need a mortgage, they’re probably looking at a 5.5% rate on the new house. Sometimes moving is unavoidable, but for those looking simply to buy a bigger or better home, it might be worth thinking twice since you could easily be doubling your monthly housing costs without getting a lot more home for the increased expense, Kopelman says. “You need to see what size house is now affordable based on the interest rate because it is going to drive up your payment,” he adds. For consumers who did refinance and are sitting on good rates, they may be better off investing any extra money right now as opposed to focusing on paying down that debt as quickly as possible, says Elliot Herman, a CFP and chief investment officer of Boston-based PRW Wealth Management. But he adds this applies only to low-interest loans. Paying off credit card debt—the average rate which now sits at 16.36%— and other high-interest loans should be a priority as interest rates continue to climb. With inflation at record levels, it can seem like having savings sitting in cash is a bad idea. But it’s not the worst solution if you’ve earmarked that money for a short-term goal like buying a house in the next couple of years or setting money aside for emergencies. “It is still okay to be in cash,” says Andrew Marshall, a CFP and California-based financial planner. Cash savings is just fine, especially because there’s a significant possibility that stocks struggle from here, Marshall says. You don’t want to take $100,000 that you've set aside to buy a home and invest it in the S&P 500, only to find two years from now that it’s worth only $75,000. But if your goals are longer-term, then you may want to consider at least putting some of that money to work, says Ryan Firth, a financial planner and founder of Texas-based Mercer Street. “What I've seen in my practice is that some clients are sitting on cash, which is earning nothing and, given inflation, is eroding their purchasing power. So just getting them to put that money to work is important,” he says. Despite the uncertainty around the impact of ongoing rate hikes, inflation, and the U.S. economic outlook, investors should focus on controlling what they can, Kopelman says. And financial advisers will almost always give you the same advice: Pay off high-interest debt and save for the future. This is a long game.

5/7/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The global market selloff that saw the S&P 500 Index post its worst first four months of a year since 1939 has further to run, according to Bank of America Corp.

Every asset class saw outflows in the week prior to the Federal Reserve’s meeting, with real estate posting its biggest outflow on record -- $2.2 billion -- and investors piling into safe havens like U.S. Treasuries, BofA said, citing EPFR Global data through Wednesday. The Nasdaq 100 Index tumbled 5.1% on Thursday, the most since September 2020, slumping along with most bond markets and unwinding the prior day’s post-Federal Reserve bounce. The wild two days for markets leaves the tech-heavy gauge down 21% for the year amid concerns about inflation, aggressive rate hikes and an economic slowdown. European stocks and U.S. futures fell on Friday morning in London, signaling the selloff may continue. “Paralysis rather than panic best describes investor positioning,” Hartnett wrote, saying the market is grappling with how to price in inflation and slowing growth. “‘Recession shock’ was priced-in too quickly; this is a problem as stronger-than-expected economic data in the first half is causing the market to price-in longer/bigger inflation/rates shock,” he wrote. Still, Hartnett noted that the average entry point for $1.1 trillion in inflows to the S&P 500 since January 2021 was 4,274 index points, meaning that investors are “under water but only somewhat” for now, with the gauge at around 4,147 points.

5/7/2022,"The markets went into bloodbath mode on Thursday as all the main indexes tumbled by at least 3%, with the NASDAQ’s 5% drop the most acute. That represented the tech-heavy index’s biggest one-day dive since June 2020. The force of the plunge confirms what we all know by now - the market headwinds are piling up, one upon the other. At its base, the issue is simple: there are too many problems, coming in too fast, and both the impersonal markets and the individual investors are finding it difficult to keep up. The nature of the obstacles is also well known by this point. A combination of COVID and responses; high inflation, goosed by too much government stimulus, the central banks’ prolonged policies of near-zero interest rates; the supply chain disruptions, initially sparked by the pandemic but exacerbated by inflation; and the Russia-Ukraine war, which has added fuel to all of that. It all adds up to the most difficult macroeconomic picture since the Carter Administration. But the news doesn’t have to be all doom and gloom. As Oppenheimer’s chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus reminds us, these kind of difficulties also open avenues for success: “The longer one survives the process of volatility sourced in financial, health and geopolitical related issues as well as the day to day of whatever rattles, conjures, and drives the markets—the more one comes to realize that challenging times provide valuable experience from which to profit from ideas and innovation that come from meeting whatever are the challenges at hand.” Applying Stolzfus’ take to its recommendations, Oppenheimer is pounding the table on two stocks in particular. Noting that both have solid long-term growth prospects, the firm’s analysts believe each has at least 80% upside potential. After running the tickers through TipRanks’ database, it’s clear the rest of the Street is in agreement, with each earning a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Nyxoah (NYXH) We’ll start with a European medical device company, Nyxoah. Based in Belgium, this firm is working on a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common breathing disorder that affects well over 900 million people worldwide. More than 400 million patients in that potential population suffer from OSA severe enough to require treatment – and a large portion of them have proven unable to tolerate traditional positive airway pressure therapies. This is Nyxoah’s patient base for its Genio device, a battery-free hypoglossal nerve stimulator developed for single-incision implementation. The device’s operation is intended to keep the upper airway open so the patient can sleep. Nyxoah has an active clinical trial program testing the Genio device, and in March the company released data on its BETTER SLEEP study. This trial, which involved 42 patients in Australia, met all of the primary endpoints across all the patient cohorts. The success of the BETTER SLEEP trial is the basis for the company’s next clinical study, the pivotal DREAM trial. The study is currently enrolling patients and is expected to run into next year. The company has also begun commercialization activities of the Genio product in the German market, and generated 852K Euros (US$ 900K) in revenue last year. Ongoing clinical trials and preparation for a commercial launch are expensive activities, and to raise capital, Nyxoah held an IPO in July of 2021. The event saw the NYXH ticker debut on the NASDAQ, with 2.835 million shares sold at $30 each. The IPO raised $97.8 million in new capital for the company, and Nyxoah was able to finish the year with 135.5 million (US$143.3 million) in cash reserves. Covering this company for Oppenheimer, analyst Suraj Kalia outlines why he believes that the DREAM trial is the key catalyst ahead, writing, “Final readouts from the pivotal study DREAM, expected summer CY23, should provide definitive proof as to whether or not bHGNS (bilateral hypoglossal nerve stim) ‘might’ provide an incrementally more efficacious approach vs. unilateral (uHGNS), liberalize patient selection criteria somewhat, and improve leverageability in the business model.” “For sure,” Kalia went on to write, “this is soon going to become a dogfight between the unilateral vs. bilateral camp believers. We believe that if execution and clinical risk are managed, the Nyxoah story presents an attractive entry point, with key elements of strategic attractiveness.” These comments support Kalia’s Outperform (Buy) rating, and his $30 price target indicates room for 104% share appreciation by year’s end. (To watch Kalia’s track record, click here) This company has not been in the public markets for very long, but it already has 5 analyst reviews on record. These reviews include 4 to Buy and 1 to Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $14.72 and their $29.10 average price target suggests a 98% one-year upside. (See NYXH stock forecast on TipRanks) Modular Medical (MODD) Sticking with the medical device sector, we’ll move on to Modular Medical. This company is entering the highly competitive market in the treatment of diabetes; Modular is working on the development and commercialization of a new insulin pump for the management of Type 1 diabetes. This life-long, chronic, uncurable condition affects more than 1.9 million people in the US alone – and can be treated and managed with regular doses of insulin. Insulin pump technology was invented to make dosing easier for patients – the pump device is wearable, and can be programmed to deliver the correct dose at the correct time, avoiding multiple self-administered daily injections. There are already multiple models of insulin pumps on the market, and 32% of the total patient population uses a pump device. To build an entry into this market, Modular Medical is targeting the ‘almost pumpers,’ a patient population that currently does not use a pump but would if: pumps were less expensive; easier to use; and perceived as lower tech. Enter Modular Medical’s pump, the MODD1, an accessible technology to make diabetes control easier for patients. The pump is designed to be easy to learn and use, with several disposable parts, including a replaceable single-use battery. At the same time, the MODD1 features the same large insulin reservoir as more expensive current models. The pump is assembled in two main parts, a 90-day reusable section and a 3-day disposable section. Modular Medical went public only in February of this year, in an IPO that was cut back from its original filing. The company put 2.5 million shares on the market, at $6 each, and raised $15 million in gross proceeds. In his review of Modular Medical, Oppenheimer’s Steven Lichtman notes the risks involved, but points out the key factors that are likely to support the stock. He writes, “MODD1 is designed for low-cost manufacturing; with this flexibility management expects to provide the reusable pump component for free (opening pharmacy channel access) and offer free customer samples as well as co-pay assistance. MODD1 will have on-body wear and a simple (easy to train) insulin administration regimen. The pump was developed by founder, industry veteran and Tandem founder Paul DiPerna. There are risks—MODD1 is pre-approval and the pump market is highly competitive. But, with its new design, MODD is looking to expand a large, underpenetrated market.” In light of these comments, the 5-star analyst rates the shares as Outperform (a Buy) and sets an $8 price target implying an 89% one-year upside. (To watch Lichtman’s track record, click here) Modular Medical has already picked up 3 analyst reviews and they are all positive, making for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The $9 average price target is even more bullish than Lichtman will allow and suggests a 98% upside from the current trading price of $4.23.

5/7/2022,"Fears of a U.S. delisting for stocks which don’t comply with U.S. auditing laws have been casting a shadow over Chinese stocks for a while now. However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s latest list of 80 companies potentially facing the cull sent shares of many spiraling down on Thursday. Among those taking a sharp beating were shares of Chinese EV maker Nio (NIO), which crashed by 15%, further piling on the losses; shares now sit 50% into the red in 2022. However, following the disclosure, Nio also provided some news that could serve to sweeten the pill somewhat. The company announced the proposed secondary listing on the main board of the Singapore Exchange. The SGX-ST has provided Nio with conditional eligibility and once the Singapore listing goes ahead, NIO shares will be fully fungible with its ADR (American depositary receipt) shares. Morgan Stanley’s Tim Hsiao thinks this is “likely to alleviate investor concerns.” “With full fungibility, NIO's dual-listings in HK and SG should meaningfully hedge any potential US de-listing disruption to operations and funding access,” the analyst explained. “With NIO's secondary HK listing likely to be converted to its primary listing in a year or so, per HKEX regulations, we think the SG listing looks set to help NIO gain more traction by broadening its investor base.” Nio’s problems, though, have not been solely reserved for the issues with the U.S. regulators. April sales declined by 49% month-over-month to 5,074 units, also representing a 29% year-over-year drop. In a sense, investors already knew what was coming as production and deliveries were seriously impacted by supply chain snags revolving around recent Covid-19 lockdowns. That said, Hsiao thinks near-term execution will be vital to keep investors on side. “While soft April sales should have been well anticipated, investors are likely to keep a close watch over the resumption progress post China's May holidays, which is critical to NIO’s ramp-up pace for ET7 and the timing of a potential face-lift for its incumbent SUV model,” the analyst opined. Hsiao still backs Nio, reiterating an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating and $34 price target. There’s upside of 121% from current levels. (To watch Hsiao’s track record, click here) The Street's average target is an even more optimistic $40.51, making room for one-year gains of 163%. That confidence is reflected by the Strong Buy consensus rating, which is based on 14 Buys vs. 2 Holds.

5/7/2022,"(Reuters) - U.S. natural gas prices are surging, with the benchmark futures contract rising to a 13-year high of $8.74 per million British thermal units, at a time when that fuel's price tends to dip due to lack of demand in the spring. But analysts say a number of factors have combined to boost the cost of gas, which has risen about 90% since the beginning of March. Here is what is happening: WEATHER Simply put, it is hotter than normal in many parts of the United States. Power generators rely on gas to produce electricity, which is used by consumers and businesses to cool buildings. Weather in Houston, the biggest city in Texas, is expected to reach 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 Celsius) over the weekend, or about 15 degrees F higher than normal for this time of year. Cooling demand in Northern California spiked earlier this week as well, and people responded by turning on air conditioners. Spot prices - the cost to buy gas in specific locations - spiked in several spots, including the Henry Hub benchmark in Louisiana as well as in California, Pennsylvania and Chicago. ALL ENERGY MARKETS ARE RISING The gas market is getting caught up in the frenzy that has hit the oil, fuel and coal markets as countries scramble to make sure they have enough reliable energy in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia is the world's biggest exporter of crude and fuel and is also the biggest exporter of natural gas. With fewer exports of Russian energy, countries in Europe and elsewhere are trying to secure supply. It is that factor that has boosted European benchmarks to several multiples of the U.S. price, as gas futures at the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) were at $33 on Thursday. The United States has helped by diverting cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe, and many expect LNG demand to continue to surge as European nations shun Russia in the years to come. LNG EXPORTS The United States has generally been isolated when it comes to the natural gas market. The nation produces roughly 97 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas, enough for domestic consumption and export of about 12 bcfd by way of LNG tankers. However, export demand is rising, and even though the United States cannot add capacity at a moment's notice, expectations of a continued call on that demand are boosting the price of natural gas. LACK OF STORAGE The spring is the optimal moment for natural gas utilities to sock away gas in preparation for cold months which are two seasons away. But that hasn't happened, in part due to rising overseas demand and worry about additional curtailment of global energy supply. As a result, there is less gas in storage right now than normal, with current storage at 1.567 trillion cubic feet, or about 16% below the five-year average for supply.

5/7/2022,"In just a little over three weeks, Nvidia (NVDA) is due to report its Q1 2022 earnings. Perhaps in preparation for that big event, investment bank Morgan Stanley announced it is resuming coverage of the semiconductors giant -- and provided a few thoughts on the company ahead of earnings. ""Nvidia,"" writes Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore, ""remains one of the best growth names in the semis space [and] is a core holding."" For this reason, the analyst says Morgan Stanley's approach will be ""to at least maintain a market weighting in the stock, and look for spots for an overweight."" In other words, Moore appears to be saying here that under no circumstances would Morgan Stanley consider rating Nvidia a Sell. Moore notes that Nvidia has built ""a strong, differentiated cloud [artificial intelligence / machine learning] business and leading position in gaming."" That being said, the gaming business does pose some concerns. Near term gaming numbers look ""solid,"" says Moore, and over the long term as well, the analyst says he's bullish on Nvidia's ""prospects and market positioning."" However, he does predict a deceleration in gaming revenues ""that should result in a modestly challenging 2023"" -- helped only partially by Nvidia's strength in selling server chips to data centers. So much for the business. Now let's consider the stock price. Nvidia continues to grow both sales and earnings for now, but even so, ""earnings growth will likely be partially offset by multiple compression,"" especially as inflation and interest rates rise and investors become less willing to pay large price tags for earnings far in the future. This could prove a problem for Nvidia stock, which sells for ""a meaningful premium to everything else."" By Moore's calculation, Nvidia stock sells for 38 times current year earnings and 32 times forecasts for earnings in 2023. (Valued on trailing earnings, the stock has an even higher P/E of 48). Even the most generous measurement of earnings, therefore, would require Nvidia to achieve and maintain 32% long-term earnings growth to maintain a PEG ratio of 1.0 -- and 32% long-term growth could be problematic. In part it's because these multiples are already so high that ""the stock has traded sideways since the broader high-growth tech selloff that we saw to start the year."" But a second reason for Nvidia's failure to outperform of late is because the gaming business is expected to decelerate this year. As the pandemic winds down, government handouts dry up, and Americans head back to the office to work, there's going to be less time, and less money available to spend on gaming and on gaming hardware, depressing sales of the GPUs that have always been Nvidia's forte. Additionally, recent weakness in crypto prices is hurting demand for Nvidia GPUs that have been repurposed for cryptocurrency mining, putting at risk ""about $800 mm per quarter [in sales of graphics chips] across the industry."" With these concerns in mind, Moore assigns Nvidia an equal-weight (i.e. Hold) rating for now, and a $217 price target. By the analyst's own admission, however, ""equal-weight"" is about as low a rating as Morgan Stanley is prepared to ever assign Nvidia. (To watch Moore's track record, click here) The rest of the Street is more optimistic than Morgan Stanley. 21 Buys and 6 Holds have been issued in the last three months, making NVDA a Strong Buy. At $331.14, the average price target brings the upside potential to ~68%.

5/7/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- For a measure of just how brutal Thursday’s reversal was in U.S. equities, take a look at where cash was moving in the ETF market earlier in the week.

Caught in the tech stock selloff, it tumbled 15% for both the biggest drop and lowest close since 2020. In the same time frame almost $1.8 billion poured into the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG), just in time for the fund’s worst day in nearly two years. Almost $600 million was plowed into the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which slumped 8.9% for its biggest drop since the height of the Covid turmoil. It’s possible investors managed to exit before the worst of the declines -- maybe even retaining some of their gains from a day earlier, when stocks enjoyed a broad post-Fed rally. TQQQ and ARKK report flows with a one-day lag, meaning Thursday activity isn’t visible yet. HYG recorded a tiny $23 million outflow. But flows elsewhere suggest a broad pattern of bets on a change in market sentiment after months of rotation toward value and economically sensitive shares at the expense of growth stocks. Those moves also look ill-timed. The three days through Wednesday saw some $372 million pulled from the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF (SQQQ), which offers an amplified bet against the Nasdaq 100. It surged 15% on Thursday. The ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (UVXY), the largest fund riding U.S. stock volatility, lost $124 million before rallying 26% for its best day in more than five months. Meanwhile, the bets on growth continued even during Thursday’s pummeling.

5/7/2022,"The steep sell-off in Amazon (AMZN) stock is rolling right along. Shares of the tech giant fell 7.5% on Thursday amid a sweeping sell-off for markets after the Federal Reserve meeting Wednesday, hitting 52-week lows during the session. Disappointing quarterly earnings and outlooks from e-commerce rivals eBay (EBAY), Shopify (SHOP), Etsy (ETSY), and Wayfair (W) didn't help sentiment around Amazon. Each company warned of slower online retail demand and the need to reinvest more aggressively to address new shopper behaviors. Year to date, Amazon's stock is down 30%, a worse decline than the 21% drop for the Nasdaq Composite and the 12.99% decrease in the S&P. An argument could be made that investors are still digesting an un-Amazon-like first quarter. Profits were hit by a $6 billion headwind from supply chain inefficiencies and general inflation, the company said. And Amazon's sales increase of 7% in the quarter marked the company's slowest growth rate in more than two decades. (Amazon sales saw a 44% rise in the same period last year.) Looking forward, Amazon outlined a potential $4 billion hit to profits in the second quarter from the same factors and promised to bring spending more in line with sales trends into the back half of the year. ""Amazon is now large enough and diversified enough to be fully exposed to global macro challenges, and its EPS results and outlook, especially on the cost side, reflect that,"" warned Mark Mahaney, tech analyst at Evercore ISI. ""We believe these macro issues are transitory (sigh), and that Amazon can effectively execute through them, delivering rising profit margins over time, but this is now likely a late-2022/early-2023 transition vs. our prior expectation of mid-’22.""

5/7/2022,"By Gram Slattery and Roberto Samora RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's Petrobras posted a first-quarter net income that beat forecasts on Thursday, just minutes after Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro railed against the state-run oil company's profitability, saying its executives had no sympathy for ordinary people. In a securities filing, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, posted a quarterly net income of 44.56 billion reais ($8.86 billion), above a Refinitiv consensus estimate of 43.5 billion reais and almost 40 times greater than the same quarter last year. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, came in at 77.71 billion reais, slightly above the Refinitiv estimate of 76.3 billion reais. In comments accompanying the results, Petrobras attributed the profit jump to factors including high Brent crude oil prices, wider margins in its diesel business and reduced liquefied natural gas imports. It noted that its divestment program had slowed from the previous quarter. The first-quarter results, however, were largely overshadowed by comments made by Bolsonaro during a weekly broadcast on multiple social media platforms, just minutes before the results were published. In a particularly free-wheeling address, he said Petrobras was committing a ""crime"" and a ""rape"" against Brazil by posting bumper profits, while squeezing Brazilian consumers at the gas pump. The far-right Bolsonaro said he would not interfere with Petrobras' operations, but implored the company not to raise fuel prices any further. Bolsonaro faces a tough fight in his bid for a second term as president in the October election and has been trailing the left-wing former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in opinion surveys. Petrobras has a policy of pegging domestic fuel prices to international rates, a policy which has come under fire as prices have skyrocketed amid the war in Ukraine. In a statement accompanying Petrobras' results, Chief Executive José Mauro Coelho, who took the reins in April after his predecessor was fired amid a spat over domestic fuel prices, said the company was contributing to society though taxation and dividends. ""All of this generates economic development throughout the entire chain of production, creating employment, wealth and tax income for the nation,"" Coelho wrote. ""This quarter, we will pay to federal, state and municipal governments an amount equal to one and a half times our net income in taxes."" The company announced ordinary dividend payments of 3.715 reais per share early on Thursday. The government is by far its largest shareholder.

5/7/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Christian Klein was in his second year as chief executive of SAP SE in January 2021 when he addressed a staff meeting to field questions about the imminent launch of a new push into cloud computing. Most Read from Bloomberg China Orders Government, State Firms to Dump Foreign PCs Stocks Crater as Fed-Policy Jitters Rock Trading: Markets Wrap Elon Musk’s Fixer Is Quietly Tending the World’s Biggest Fortune U.S. Forgives $6.8 Billion in Public Service Worker Student Loans Fiona Hill Says Putin Sensed West’s Weakness Before Ukraine War A staffer took Klein, 42, to task over female representation. “If gender equality and women in leadership is important to SAP, why are there no female speakers?” one employee asked through a moderator, concerning the event planned for the announcement later that month. Klein’s response took the audience aback. He said the question was “fair,” and that SAP needs to improve its diversity. However, he added that he couldn’t change the status quo overnight. “You can’t just have anyone on the stage who has no clue on the topic,” Klein said, according to a recording of the event. Several female employees found his response offensive because it suggested he regarded women as unknowledgeable, and they lodged complaints seen by senior management, according to people with direct knowledge of the interchange. While Klein later walked back the comments, the clash struck at the heart of SAP’s struggle to elevate and retain women in some of its senior-most positions, including the former co-CEO and a one-time president of SAP’s operations in Asia. Although the company’s policy permits “close personal connections” between colleagues as long as they avoid conflicts of interest, some women believe the policy tacitly condones inappropriate behavior. The software company has hosted networking events that involve heavy drinking and have resulted in unwelcome advances from senior male managers toward female colleagues, according to more than a dozen current and former SAP employees. Some women who have complained about mistreatment, such as bullying, unfair treatment, or offensive sexual advances, found HR to be unhelpful or hostile, in some cases moving women to other roles or pushing them out of the company entirely, several people said. The people who spoke to Bloomberg requested anonymity because they fear reprisals and don’t want to jeopardize their job prospects. “SAP has a zero-tolerance policy for harassment and unlawful discrimination of all kinds,” Joellen Perry, an SAP spokeswoman, said in a statement. “We have a robust process for investigating 100% of reported allegations, and consequences for those found to be in violation of our policies can and have included termination of employment.” Walldorf, Germany-based SAP is Europe’s largest technology company, but its businesses span the globe, and it employs more than 31,000 people in the U.S. SAP has been struggling with a new strategy and fierce competition from rivals including Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp. and Workday Inc. The stock has declined about 25% this year, giving SAP a market capitalization of about 115 billion euros ($122 billion). The swoon reflects a pandemic-related drop in demand for the company’s Concur travel-expense management software, as well as concerns that Klein’s strategic shift toward cloud-based products has yet to bear fruit. Companies across the technology industry have struggled to promote women to the highest levels. Research has shown that executives rarely attempt to change their company in a structural way to improve gender equality, and a PwC study of 2,000 U.K. university students showed 78% of students can’t name a famous woman working in technology. But while major U.S. tech companies have been accused of failing to support women, many of their European rivals have largely managed to avoid similar scrutiny. In the U.S., technology bellwethers, from Activision Blizzard Inc. to Uber Technologies Inc., have well-documented histories of failing to combat harassment. Others, including Intel Corp. and Hewlett-Packard, have removed CEOs after learning that they were involved in intimate relationships with colleagues. Google parent Alphabet Inc. pledged $310 million in 2020 to expand diversity efforts and resolve shareholder litigation that alleged the company’s board to failed to prevent sexual harassment and hid misconduct by executives. In Europe, more than a dozen people made public claims of sexual harassment and abuse against employees of French game-maker Ubisoft. SAP made history in 2019 when it promoted Jennifer Morgan, 51, to the role of co-CEO, alongside Klein. She was the first woman to lead one of Germany’s 30 largest listed companies. But the pair disagreed on key issues from the start, Klein said in an interview in 2020. The co-CEO structure was disorganized and, at times, chaotic, a person with knowledge of the matter said at the time. Morgan helped oversee operations from SAP’s U.S. office outside Philadelphia, while Klein worked from headquarters in Walldorf, remaining close to Hasso Plattner, 78, SAP’s influential co-founder and chairman. After less than a year, Morgan was on the way out. She is currently global head of portfolio operations at Blackstone Inc. Eight months afters Morgan’s exit, Adaire Fox-Martin, an executive board member and the former president of SAP’s Asia Pacific Japan business through 2017, announced her departure. Fox-Martin was a mentor to many women at SAP, and her resignation caused shockwaves among senior female leaders, several employees said. Fox-Martin, who has since taken a role leading Google’s European cloud business, didn’t respond to LinkedIn messages requesting comment. Morgan did not respond to requests for comment. SAP added new female employee representatives to its board in 2019, and it hired former Microsoft executives Sabine Bendiek, 55, and Julia White, 48, to senior roles in 2021. About a third of SAP’s staff are female, with 28.3% in leadership roles in 2021, up from 26.4% in 2019, according to company data, putting it on par with some peers. Even so, the departures fueled concern that women are unable to thrive in senior leadership roles at SAP, according to people who spoke to Bloomberg. Fox-Martin’s exit was particularly demoralizing for women in SAP’s Asia-Pacific region, which has experienced instances of inappropriate behavior in and out of the office, several employees said. After a company event in Sydney in January 2019, a group of executives and employees visited Frankie’s Pizza, a rock-and-roll-themed dive bar at the center of the city, according to people in attendance. A senior Australian executive made unwanted advances, including groping, toward a junior female colleague, the people who were there said. The woman didn’t file a formal complaint because she didn’t think SAP’s human resources department would help, and the executive was never disciplined, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Such incidents weren’t confined to the Asia-Pacific region, current and former employees said. In Europe, after an alcohol-fueled event in Barcelona in 2020, a male sales executive took photos of a female colleague who had fallen asleep on a bus. The photos were passed around a WhatsApp group consisting of male sales staff, one person said. SAP’s Perry said the company was unable to verify any of the incidents reported by Bloomberg. “SAP is committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive workplace,” she said. “We have often been recognized by independent external parties as an outstanding place to work for women and employee feedback suggests the strong majority of employees agree we create and maintain an equitable workplace.” Many women, including senior managers, said they have been conditioned to avoid events like these. Others said female employees often feel compelled to attend because they present a rare opportunity to network. SAP requires staff to complete diversity and inclusion training every year. The company said its employees have a variety of options for reporting instances of harassment, and that 81% of employees surveyed in 2021 believed that SAP has equal opportunities regardless of gender or age. Bloomberg spoke with female executives who said they found SAP to be supportive of their careers. They asked not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak to reporters without a manager’s approval. Even so, some employees said that they are reluctant to complain to HR for fear of reprisals or because they doubt HR will take action. One U.K. employee who left an unflattering review of her manager in an anonymous questionnaire said he confronted her about the issues shortly afterward. She said that the experience made her afraid to bring up more serious complaints after she experienced discrimination and inappropriate sexual advances at work at a later date. This was among the instances SAP said it was unable to verify. Another high-ranking former female employee in Asia said she complained to HR about a manager who made inappropriate comments and asked her to keep her webcam on during the day. She said that after her complaint, which occurred in recent years, she was put on a “performance plan,” an initiative aimed at boosting the output of underperformers that often serves as a prelude to firing. A woman who said she was harassed by male executives at off-site events in recent years said she didn’t go to HR in part because of the company’s reputation for pushing out people who complain. One female executive who’s since left the company said her direct reports, including men and women, told her they believed they could go only to her, and not HR, with problems. Their concern, they told her, was that HR ignored complaints and acted in the interests of managers -- not rank-and-file workers. “Bloomberg’s failure to provide sufficient information means we’ve been unable to verify the four anecdotes provided across three years and three continents,” Perry said. SAP’s gender-related issues have surfaced in at least one court case. A former executive in Singapore, Billie Jean Burlingame, said that her job was cut in a reorganization last year after she spoke out against gender discrimination at the company, according to an ongoing lawsuit filed with the country’s High Court in December 2020. Burlingame, one of the highest-ranking women in the country, said in filings that she met or exceeded her performance targets and was on her former boss’s succession plan. Even so, SAP said she was unsuitable for her former manager’s role or any others she applied for after her position was eliminated, according to the court documents. SAP’s Perry said the company doesn’t comment on ongoing litigation. Two weeks after Klein’s comments at the company meeting in January last year, he attempted to make amends in a video shared internally. “I was by far not clear enough,” he said, adding that he’d spent time reflecting on past hiring. “I can absolutely say, no, I wasn’t always looking at diversity and inclusion,” he said. “And that isn’t a bad intention, but you pick the people you know around you.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Formula One Finally Found a Way to Get Americans to Care Wall Street Isn’t Ready for the Crackdown Coming Its Way Stock Market Bottom-Fishers Are Trawling Risky Waters The Children Left Behind by Long Covid How Managing by Moonshot Doomed Zillow’s Home Flipping ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•11 hours ago,"European Tech Giant Shaken by Bullying Claims, Exodus of Women",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sap-wrestles-concerns-over-treatment-050000085.html

5/7/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- A common warning on Wall Street for a decade is that trading desks have been overrun by people who are too young to know what it’s like to navigate a Federal Reserve tightening cycle. They’re finding out now. Most Read from Bloomberg Stocks Crater as Fed-Policy Jitters Rock Trading: Markets Wrap U.S. Forgives $6.8 Billion in Public Service Worker Student Loans China Orders Government, State Firms to Dump Foreign PCs Ukraine Latest: Jill Biden Goes to Europe; Orban Slams Proposal Elon Musk, Cathie Wood Say Passive Funds Have Gone Too Far In markets, there’s turbulence, then there’s whatever you call the last two days, when a 900-point Dow rally was followed 12 hours later by a 1,000-point decline. Hundreds of billions of dollars of value are conjured and incinerated across assets in the space of a day lately, a stark reversal from the straight-up trajectory of the post-pandemic era. Where once every dip was bought, now every bounce is sold. Thursday was only the fourth day in 20 years in which stocks and bonds each posted 2%-plus declines, going by major exchange-traded funds that track them. Concerted cross-asset stress of that magnitude reliably spurs speculation that big funds are being forced to sell. “I’m scared like everybody else,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group and one of Wall Street’s most visible bulls. “I’ve been in the business almost 40 years now-- these things don’t get any easier, because you never know for sure and you also know you’ve been wrong in the past.” Behind the churn is a Fed committed to what will likely be the most aggressive withdrawal of stimulus for the economy since 1994. Once an anchor of stability for the market, the central bank is now its chief antagonist, sworn to subdue the hottest inflation in four decades. “Clients are calling and saying, ‘So are we done yet? Should we be concerned? Should we put it all under the mattress?’” Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management, said by phone from Chicago. “This feels a little bit more like 2000, 2002, where it’s just a steady persistent decline punctuated by some rallies.” Fed disruption is everywhere. On Wednesday, after Chair Jerome Powell signaled that a rate increase of 75 basis points is off the table for coming meetings, stocks rallied, sending the S&P 500 to the biggest post-Fed gain in a decade. Then the market buckled Thursday, with the index falling more than 3.5% as traders reassessed the landscape. Over the past 25 years, only three other Fed policy meetings have seen big market reversals of this size to the downside over the first two days. “What a difference a day makes,” said Frank Davis, senior managing director at LEK Securities. “Yesterday people were reading into the Fed’s comment seeing some predictability and stability. But now that looks like a big headfake.” Virtually every asset is suffering from central bank-induced turmoil. The dollar, down almost 1% on the Fed day, staged a full recovery Thursday to approach a 20-year high. In fixed income, 10-year Treasury yields erased Wednesday’s slide, topping 3%. Few are expecting the cavalry to ride in any time soon, or the plunge-protection team. The Fed has been hamstrung by inflation and needs financial conditions to tighten to help slow down the appreciation of prices for food, cars and shelter. While Powell has repeatedly expressed confidence in achieving a soft landing in the economy, the risk of a recession is a threat investors can’t afford to ignore, according to Dennis DeBusschere, the founder of 22V Research. “This is why every rally needs to be sold,” DeBusschere said. “Because higher risk assets mean you don’t fight inflation! You have no way out!!” he added. “Who the heck is going to step into this tape?” In fact, 2022 is shaping up to be the most painful year for dip buyers in decades. Since January, the average drop in the S&P 500 has lasted 2.3 days, more than any year since 1984, while its returns following down sessions have been negative 0.2%. That’s the worst in 35 years. Investors, conditioned to the success of dip buying for most of the past decade, are spooked by the new experience, exiting equity-focused funds in April at one of the fastest paces in years. To Greg Boutle, U.S. head of equity and derivative strategy at BNP Paribas, Wednesday’s bounce was “the hallmark of bear market rally.” “Positioning has been very defensive into this move, which to some extent could mitigate a sense of panic or forced selling,” he said. “But the price action today, it’s hard to read as anything other than problematic in the very short term.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Formula One Finally Found a Way to Get Americans to Care Wall Street Isn’t Ready for the Crackdown Coming Its Way Stock Market Bottom-Fishers Are Trawling Risky Waters The Children Left Behind by Long Covid How Managing by Moonshot Doomed Zillow’s Home Flipping ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•20 hours ago,‘Scared Like Everybody Else’: Stocks Go From Shaky to Unhinged,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/scared-everybody-else-stocks-shaky-201016954.html
5/7/2022,"Lucid (LCID) might have reaffirmed on its Q1 earnings call the production target of 12,000 to 14,000 units in 2022, but Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas thinks that figure is out of reach. “We forecast 9.9k deliveries for FY22 which we believe may be on the aggressive side given the company delivered 360 vehicles in 1Q including approximately 185 (our calculation) in the month of March,” the analyst explained. To come good on the reiterated guide and based on the assumption of “minimal complete” vehicles in inventory, Jonas reckons the the company would need to deliver units “at 7x to 8x the pace of March.” Nevertheless, with the results meeting Jonas’ expectations and cash flow even coming in slightly ahead of his estimate, Jonas “applauds the company for controlling cash burn at a highly sensitive time.” With 5,000 reservations made over the past 2 months, momentum is also looking “really strong,” and considering how hard it is to get a new EV up and running, with the Lucid Dream now turning heads as it zooms by, there are also compliments for the company’s ability to make it this far and get the “compelling model to market.” But despite the stock shedding 50% year-to-date, Jonas’ issue still lies with a valuation which is not “aligned with a more conservative growth and market trajectory.” Moreover, to continue to support a business “not fully funded,” Jonas believes the company is likely to seek new injections of capital. While the analyst does not anticipate any additional capital raises this year, he estimates $2 billion of new equity will be raised in FY23 and an additional $3 billion of capital (50/50 equity/debt) in 2024. As such, Jonas - waiting for a “more attractive entry point,” - sticks to an Underperform (i.e., Sell) rating and $12 price target. That figure accounts for another 36% drop from current levels. (To watch Jonas’ track record, click here) Jonas, though, is Wall Street’s most prominent LCID bear and the current 3 other reviews on file are all positive, making the consensus view here a Moderate Buy. Additionally, despite Jonas’ downbeat projection, the average price target stays a bullish one; at $40.5, the figure suggests shares will be changing hands for a 115% premium a year from now.
