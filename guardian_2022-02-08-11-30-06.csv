2/8/2022,"As New Zealand hits new records for daily case numbers, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has said she expects Omicron infections to start peaking in late March. The country reported 202 cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, following several days of numbers sitting around the 200 mark – including a record 243 cases on Saturday. The past seven days are among the highest weeks of case numbers since the pandemic began.  On Tuesday morning Ardern told RNZ, the national radio broadcaster, that she expected New Zealand’s cases to peak at between 10,000 and 30,000 cases a day. “It’s widely variable and ultimately the defining feature of where we will peak will be booster uptake. The more people who take a booster, the lower the likelihood of our peak,” she said. “While there’s uncertainty in case numbers, if you looked at low case profiles in a place like say South Australia and you applied that to New Zealand, you would have something like 10,000 cases a day at its peak.” Covid-19 minister Chris Hipkins said over the weekend that rising case numbers were expected given the emergence of the Omicron variant. “We do expect case numbers to continue to grow in the coming days and weeks and I urge people not to panic but to plan for that,” he said. Nearly 30% of New Zealand’s total population, including children, have received a booster shot; 83% have had at least one dose, and 77% two doses. Among the population aged 12 and over, 94% of New Zealanders are vaccinated with two doses – but rates are lagging among Māori, 86% of whom are double-vaccinated. While the vast majority of the country is vaccinated, some New Zealanders continue to object to vaccination, particularly the mandates that affect about 40% of the workforce. On Tuesday, anti-vaccine protesters made for parliament in what they called a “Freedom Convoy” modelled on the truckers’ protest that has caused a state of emergency to be declared in Ottawa. New Zealand’s convoy has so far been a smaller affair: an estimated 1,500 protesters were gathered at parliament on Friday afternoon. Police said that the protest was “expected to cause congestion on routes into Wellington City”. Ardern said she would not be meeting the protesters.",News/World news,"New Zealand Omicron wave likely to peak in March with up to 30,000 cases a day, says Ardern",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/new-zealand-omicron-wave-likely-to-peak-in-march-with-up-to-30000-cases-a-day-says-ardern
2/8/2022,"More than 500 elderly Australians have died in aged care with Covid-19 during the first few weeks of 2022. With Omicron plaguing nursing homes, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and Coalition frontbenchers have been out defending their management of the crisis. Here are some of their recent claims that Guardian Australia has fact-checked, including comments on the booster rollout, the reasons for low booster uptake, and how the sector is faring as staff report atrocious conditions and burnout.  The health minister, Greg Hunt, said of those who died in aged care from or with Covid, 60% were palliative and “in the absolute last days of their lives”. It is a statement Hunt repeated in subsequent press conferences. A spokesman for Hunt said the 60% figure is based on data provided by the states and territories on lives lost in residential aged care residences since July 2021. However, an aged care situation report published by Leading Age Services Australia on Wednesday said: “Further clarification of these statements is needed.” The Leading Age Services Australia chief executive, Sean Rooney, said this was because palliative care is care provided to someone with an advanced disease and terminal prognosis where the main goal of treatment is quality of life. “This is not the same as people who are in the last days of their life. People can be palliative for years,” he said. Hunt told the ABC on 3 February that: “My gentle message to families is, please, please, please, allow your residents, your families, your loved ones, to have that booster, to provide that consent.” Hunt previously said: “We know that some families have, for whatever their reasons, not provided consent for their loved ones to take up the booster.” Rooney said the number of cases where this was relevant was “quite small”. The director of the Australian Health Services Research Institute at the University of Wollongong, Prof Kathy Eagar, told the Sydney Morning Herald on Friday: “Families are not the problem. The vaccine booster program in aged care has been poorly implemented.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning There had been reports of people struggling to get boosters for their family. The director of Aged Care Matters, Dr Sarah Russell, said the role of families not consenting had been overplayed. “I know a family member who gave consent in early December,” she said. “She is still waiting for her mother to be vaccinated.” Russell said a comprehensive survey of aged care providers and residents is needed to determine the main factors contributing to low booster rates. The minister for senior Australians, Richard Colbeck, said on 2 February that the aged care sector was performing “extremely well” despite the Omicron outbreak. He said in 2020 there were 28,000 Covid cases in Australia, of which 2,051 were in aged care [7.2%], but of the 1.8m Covid cases as of 2 February, 10,500 [0.58%] were in aged care. Rooney said aged care staff and management had done extremely well, and “it’s absolutely appropriate to acknowledge this whenever we talk about the current situation”. “But the impact on the sector has still been devastating. And there is no doubt that there would have been fewer cases and fewer deaths if we had had enough RATs for daily screening of everyone, access to PCR tests where needed, access to surge workforce as promised and reliable access to PPE.” The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation said the results of its national survey, published on 1 February, found that nurses and carers were still being forced to pay for their own rapid antigen tests (RATs) to go to work. This was despite Hunt announcing on 15 August that RATs would be available to aged care homes. The survey also found 20% of nurses said they were planning to leave their position within the next 12 months and 38% within the next one to five years. According to Russell, only 668 of 2,704 private aged care homes had received RATs by 7 January. “This was a total abrogation of the government’s duty,” she said. With nurses protesting in Canberra on Tuesday morning over woeful staffing, and the defence minister, Peter Dutton, announcing on Monday 1,700 defence troops would be sent into aged care homes in an attempt to fill staffing gaps, the sector was clearly struggling. Scott Morrison told the ABC’s Sabra Lane on 2 February: “Right now, outbreaks in Canada in aged care facilities are 13 times higher than they are in Australia, and they have the same vaccination rate as us.” The federal government’s weekly aged care report now also includes data from Canada to draw a comparison. The latest report, published on Friday night, said: “By comparison, Canada has experienced over 11 times the number of deaths in care homes than Australia as at 4 February 2022.” Prof Alexandra Martiniuk, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Sydney and adjunct professor of epidemiology at the University of Toronto, said Canada has had much larger waves of Covid in the past two years compared to Australia.

Given more aged care is given in homes in Canada, those in residential facilities are likely to be much older and sicker, and therefore likely more susceptible to Covid-19 infection and severe outcomes and deaths. “Canada also has had better and earlier access to RATs, anecdotally, than Australia.” Hunt said during a press conference on 3 February that there were about 190,000 people in aged care, and of those, about 20,000 had either not had their second dose, or been vaccinated at all. He said this left a pool of about 170,000 people eligible for their booster, and of those, 125,000 had received it. “So it’s about 35,000 that have not taken it up.” Rooney said the government’s weekly report just gave the total number of doses delivered, making it impossible to ascertain booster rates from this. “We noticed odd changes in this figure, including falls in some weeks,” he said. “It is not clear why this has fluctuated, but we expect it is a function of people entering and leaving care, and then data for new and departing residents being updated.” From 4 January, the government began reporting a standalone residential aged care figure in its daily reports. This is stated in terms of number of people “fully vaccinated” or “partially vaccinated”. But the federal government definition of fully vaccinated is two doses, making it hard to ascertain booster figures. Russell said if we accepted this figure of 35,000 residents who had not received the booster, 18.5% of all residents had not been boosted, which she said was concerning. “The figures for how many residents have not received their booster shot are not public,” she said. “When Richard Colbeck was asked for this figure, he took the question on notice.”",News/Australia news,Fact check: is aged care coping ‘extremely well’ with Omicron as Morrison government claims?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/08/fact-check-is-aged-care-coping-extremely-well-with-omicron-as-morrison-government-claims
