4/17/2022,"If there is anything that Emma Raducanu’s career since her US Open triumph has reinforced beyond doubt it is just how difficult the day-to-day grind of life as a professional tennis player is. The physical load each week is considerable, injury niggles are so common that few players are ever functioning at 100% and only the strongest maintain their spot at the top. For now, as expected, Raducanu has a long way to go. In the past week in Prague, her latest injury issues are blisters on her foot. A recap of how she has fared since the US Open is largely a long list of such setbacks. She endured illness in her final tournaments of 2020, her off-season was scuppered by Covid, blisters on her hand left her hitting one-handed backhand slices at the Australian Open, in February she was forced to retire in Monterrey after sustaining a hip injury and a stiff back followed in Indian Wells. These are predictable obstacles for a player attempting to manage the physical demands of the top level despite barely even competing on the lower-level ITF tournaments, but they are also a common theme in Raducanu’s young career. Part of the reason why the 19-year-old had played so few events compared to her peers, even before last year, is because she would continually be sidelined by injury niggles. Back at Wimbledon, Raducanu referred to the numerous small injuries she sustained that meant she could watch from the sidelines as her peers had advanced up the rankings far more quickly than her. She described herself as a player who had “always been sort of held back by something”. Even as a grand slam title winner, that has not yet ceased. “She is still young, she hasn’t completed a full year on tour yet,” said Anne Keothavong, the captain of Great Britain’s Billie Jean King Cup team in the Czech Republic. “For any young player going out there for the first time, what she has achieved has been exceptional. It does take time to get used to life on the tour and become more robust. She certainly needs to become more robust. That is no secret. She knows that. She is working on it.” Still, there is ample optimism. In Prague, for instance, Raducanu dug deep to escape with a 7-5, 7-5 win against the No 50 Tereza Martincova and record a first win in a clay-court match. While the frustration seemed to have taken a toll earlier in the year, Raducanu and the rest of her teammates seemed to really enjoy the team atmosphere and even if the quality is lacking compared to other nations, Keothavong has helped to cultivate a positive atmosphere in the team. Such is the nature of the tour, it stops for nobody. Raducanu was already straight on to a flight to Stuttgart in the morning for the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix, one of the toughest WTA events of the year. The tournament boasts seven of the top nine players. Although it remains to be seen how her foot will hold up, Raducanu was in the draw on Sunday. The past week was also notable for the absence of Russian and Belarusian teams, the former team being the Billie Jean King Cup defending champions. As the tour continues to tick over, talks to determine whether the large contingent of Russian and Belarusian tennis players will be allowed to compete at Wimbledon are still ongoing, said the Lawn Tennis Association chief executive, Scott Lloyd, in Prague. “Conversations with the government and indeed their counterparts in other countries are still ongoing,” Lloyd said. “There is no definite position there either. The government have given all sports guidance in terms of how we should try to work through some of these challenges, which range from a full ban to very robust declarations on behalf of individuals. “We need to try to work through what the impact and implications of trying to implement that guidance looks like. This is something that we are working very closely with the All England Club on day-in, day-out right now.” Players potentially affected include the US Open champion Daniil Medvedev, the two-times major champion Victoria Azarenka, Aryna Sabalenka and Andrey Rublev, who all currently compete as neutral individuals. Unlike other sports in Russia, the top-ranked tennis players employ their own individual teams, live abroad and are not funded by the Russian or Belarusian states. “It is an enormously complex situation,” Lloyd said. “I think we are all aligned in finding the actions that we see in our papers and TV screens, it is absolutely abhorrent. In truth, the conversation is ongoing, we are in very close dialogue with the All England Club, the government, with the tours. We are very conscious of public sentiment in this area. We are trying to navigate what that needs to look like in the summer events in Britain this year.”",Sport/Sport,Emma Raducanu’s blisters are latest setback as she adjusts to grind of tour,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/17/emma-raducanus-blisters-are-latest-setback-as-she-adjusts-to-grind-of-tour
4/17/2022,"Ministers are facing calls to put British clocks forward by an extra hour to Central European Time to help ease the cost of living crisis. The Liberal Democrat peer John Lee said moving to Paris time would help reduce household bills as it would maximise daylight in the evenings. Lord Lee said the government should look seriously at “double summer time” as inflation reaches the highest level in 30 years and energy bills continue to soar. “It’s a serious, long-term issue for a sizeable proportion of the population and I think the government should look very seriously at it,” he said. “Double summer time would be relatively cheap, it wouldn’t really cost the government anything of significance as far as I’m aware.” Lee, the president of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions and a former tourism minister, said he would question the government about its position on double summer time when the House of Lords returns from recess later this month. Such a move would set British clocks two hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time during the summer months and one hour ahead in winter, as in continental nations including France, Spain and Italy. The last time the clocks were changed to save on energy was during the second world war, but times went back to normal after the war. The concept of British summer time was established in the UK in 1916 after campaigning by William Willett, a great-great-grandfather of Coldplay’s Chris Martin. Willett had observed with dismay during a pre-dawn horse rides through London how many Britons slept through a large portion of a summer’s day. Campaigners have estimated that extending daylight hours further would save each household 152 hours’ worth of electricity each year, as most people wake up after sunrise for most of the year and use artificial light in their homes in the evenings. Supporters say people would enjoy an extra hour of light for an additional 11 months of the year, whereas an extra hour of morning darkness would only have to be endured during the winter months. There have been several attempts by MPs to advocate a change in daylight saving time in recent decades, most recently in 2010 with the 10:10 campaign. A 1993 study by the Policy Studies Institute estimated that the change would save more than £260m in electricity bills even then. However, the government told MPs on the energy and climate change committee in 2010 that the effects were “likely to be small in magnitude, and may even be uncertain in direction”. The greatest opposition has historically come from farmers in Scotland, who would have to work in darkness for much of the morning. However, their opposition appears to have softened thanks to modern advances in farming. The National Farmers Union of Scotland said it was “open to further independent analysis”. The idea of adopting the same time as France, Spain and Italy may, however, raise some eyebrows among some Eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers now the UK has left the European Union. Lee, a former Tory MP, said: “I think it would be frankly very silly if they kicked it into touch purely because it’s something that happens more in continental Europe. I can’t believe they would be that selfish or narrow to adopt that approach.”",News/UK news,Lib Dem peer calls for ‘double summer time’ to ease cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/17/double-summer-time-minister-urged-put-uk-clocks-forward-ease-cost-of-living-crisis-john-lee
4/17/2022,"A “giant leap” in global food prices caused by Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has helped three members of the super-rich Cargill family, who majority-own one of the world’s largest food companies, join the ranks of the world’s 500 richest people. Siblings James Cargill, Austen Cargill and Marianne Liebmann – all great-grandchildren of William Wallace Cargill, who founded the Cargill company in 1865 – this week joined the Bloomberg Billionaires list of the richest 500 people alive. Each of them has an estimated $5.4bn (£4.1bn) fortune – up a fifth so far this year. They join Cargill’s other great-grandchildren Pauline Keinath and Gwendolyn Sontheim Meyer on the richest 500 list. They each have fortunes of about $8.06bn. Their fortunes track those of the giant Cargill food company, which employs more than 155,000 staff in 70 countries, and is expected to report record profits this year, outstripping 2021’s record-breaking $5bn profit. The United Nations this month warned that global food prices had soared to a record high because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization said its food price index rose by 12.6% in March compared with February, “making a giant leap to a new highest level since its inception in 1990”. The UN said the war in Ukraine “spread shocks through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils”. The price of cereals, vegetable oils and meat have all reached all-times highs, the agency said. The war has disrupted Black Sea exports of crucial commodities from a region that had been producing more than a quarter of the world’s wheat exports. The invasion has helped push cereal prices up 17% over the past month, with the closure of ports throttling wheat and maize exports from Ukraine. Russian exports have also been slowed by financial and shipping problems. World wheat prices soared by 19.7% during March, while maize prices posted a 19.1% month-on-month increase, hitting a record high along with those of barley and sorghum. Food prices were already rising before Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in February, and Cargill’s chief executive, David MacLennan, had said he expected them to remain high throughout 2022. Cargill, which has its headquarters in Minnesota, reported a 63% increase in profits last year to almost $4.93bn – the biggest in its 157-year history. Revenues rose by 17% to $134bn. Andrew Speke of the High Pay Centre thinktank, which campaigns for a fairer society, said the soaring wealth of the Cargill family was “a depressing indictment of our current economic model – one which has enabled a tiny minority to grow ever richer despite the longest freeze of living standards in the modern era and a cost of living crisis which is threatening to impoverish millions”. He added: “Now more than ever, it is essential that governments take serious action to redistribute wealth from the super-rich to those on low and middle incomes.” Three more Cargill family members – Alexandra Daitch, Sarah MacMillan and Lucy Stitzer – are also billionaires. The extended family controls about 87% of the company and is ranked as the 11th richest family in the world, with a collective fortune of about $50bn. Eric Muňoz, Oxfam America’s senior policy adviser for agriculture, said: “Right now, we’re seeing food prices skyrocket, which is taking a devastating toll on the most vulnerable communities. Exorbitant food prices, alongside the Covid-19 pandemic are pushing families in countries like Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and South Sudan to the breaking point – meanwhile, the richest have seen their profits soar. We must see urgent action to save lives now and to address the inequality, broken food system and other root causes that are driving this crisis.” Gemma McGough, a British entrepreneur and a founding member of Patriotic Millionaires UK, a group campaigning for the introduction of a wealth tax on the world’s richest people to help close the inequality gap, said the Cargill family’s soaring wealth was yet another example of “the grotesque failure of our global economy”. She said: “We are in a state of multiple crises, and governments cannot continue to stand by while hunger and food poverty increases and the wealth of a select few soars. It is essential that we rebalance our economies, taxing the wealth of people like me, and invest in systems that can support the millions of families currently unable to feed their children.”",News/News,Soaring food prices push more Cargill family members on to world’s richest 500 list,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/apr/17/soaring-food-prices-push-more-cargill-family-members-on-to-world-richest-500-list
4/17/2022,"The anti-epilepsy drug sodium valproate can cause birth defects, but data has revealed it is still being prescribed to pregnant women, with concerns also raised that they are not always given information about the risks. But what is the drug, and how big is the problem? According to the NHS, sodium valproate can be given as a liquid, capsules, tablets or, in some cases, injections, and is used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder. It is sometimes also prescribed to people who have migraines. In the UK, brands that contain sodium valproate include Epilim and Dyzantil. If taken by pregnant women, sodium valproate can cause birth defects, such as cleft palate, limb defects and heart problems, as well as developmental problems, including difficulties with language and learning. This pattern of outcomes is termed foetal valproate spectrum disorder (FVSD). The Cumberlege Review, published in 2020, flagged that children with FVSD may also have bendy joints or differences in their facial features. “In some cases, the developmental difficulties they experience may also meet the criteria for other diagnoses such as autism spectrum disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,” the report noted. According to the Medicines and Pregnancy Registry, a result of a collaboration between NHS Digital and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), exposure to sodium valproate during pregnancy has declined in recent years, with number of pregnant women prescribed the drug declining by 51% between the 2018-19 financial year and the 2020-21 financial year. However, between April 2018 and September 2021, 247 women were prescribed sodium valproate in a month in which they were pregnant. The figure includes 138 women for whom a prescription issued in their first trimester was subsequently stopped, 98 for whom such a prescription was continued, 14 for whom the drug was prescribed during pregnancy after the first trimester and nine women who were prescribed the drug in the month they were expected to deliver their baby. The team behind the registry note that not all pregnancies would have resulted in a birth, but say that the figures may be an undercount. According to the Cumberlege review, by the time of the report, an estimated 20,000 people in the UK had been affected by in-utero exposure to sodium valproate. The review adds that it is thought 10% of unborn children exposed to sodium valproate are likely to develop birth defects while 40% will have a developmental delay or autism. “The system still does not know where all these valproate-affected children, now adults in many cases, are, or how to contact them to secure the proper diagnosis and assessment of their care needs,” the review noted. A number of measures have been taken to try to prevent sodium valproate being given to pregnant women: in 2018 the MHRA stated that the drug must not be prescribed to those who could become pregnant unless they were on a pregnancy prevention programme. The valproate pregnancy prevention programme sets out, among other actions, that women and girls must always use effective contraception while taking the drug, with patients and their healthcare professional needing to sign a risk acknowledgment form every year. Among actions for pharmacists, the MHRA stated: “Make sure you provide every patient with the statutory patient information leaflet – even if you have to split a pack.” After the Cumberlege review, the Valproate Safety Implementation Group was set up, with initiatives including sending a letter from the NHS to all women and girls aged 12 and over who have a current prescription for sodium valproate, flagging the risks posed to unborn babies. However, the latest data from the Medicines and Pregnancy Registry suggests that despite such actions, some pregnant women are still being prescribed sodium valproate, with an investigation by the Sunday Times reporting that in some cases, the drugs were not accompanied by information leaflets or warnings on boxes.",News/Society,Sodium valproate: what are dangers of epilepsy drug for unborn babies?,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/17/sodium-valproate-what-are-dangers-of-epilepsy-drug-for-unborn-babies
4/17/2022,"The 150-1 success of Freewheelin Dylan last year was a reminder that the Irish Grand National can be every bit as unpredictable as the original, and this year’s renewal also includes six runners who failed to complete the first circuit at Aintree last week. That half-dozen includes Run Wild Fred, who was backed down to just 8-1 shortly before the off but fell at the Canal Turn, and Enjoy D’Allen, another fancied runner, who unseated his rider when stumbling on landing over the first. The record of Aintree Grand National runners on Easter Monday is poor, however: of 22 runners to have gone on from Liverpool to Fairyhouse since 2004, 14 were pulled up, five more finished 10th or worse and only one (in fourth) has even made the frame. Gaillard Du Mesnil, the early favourite, is making his handicap debut off 154 having run third in the Grade One Brown Advisory Novice Chase at the Cheltenham Festival and clearly has scope for progress after just four chase starts. This is a very different test, however, and there are other contenders at better odds with as much, if not more, potential for improvement over extreme distances. Max Flamingo (nap 5.00) is perhaps the most interesting of these. Francis Casey’s seven-year-old has improved steadily over fences this season during a campaign that has seemingly been planned with Monday’s race in mind, and the move up to a marathon trip could well see him take another big step forward.

4/17/2022,"Swedish House Mafia’s 2012 hit single Don’t You Worry Child embodied the commercial boom of EDM throughout the 2010s. Sounding like the saccharine climax of a Made in Chelsea episode, its emotive vocal and pop melody, paired with bright synths and a thumping kick drum, set the template for coming hits by the likes of Avicii and Kygo. Ten years later, the Swedish supergroup – DJs Axwell, Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso – reboot this hybrid pop-club music for their debut album. At its worst, Paradise Again is derivative and dated. Tracks play like pastiches: Lifetime apes Starboy-era the Weeknd in its undulating rhythm and 070 Shake’s falsetto vocals; the syncopated modular synth sounds of Time are better articulated on Floating Points’ 2015 record Elaenia. In its livelier moments, the album tries to revive sounds in new contexts. Redlight samples the Police’s Roxanne, splicing Sting’s yearning hook over a menacing techno beat to surprisingly enjoyable effect, while It Gets Better flirts with the processed synths of the Prodigy’s 1997 single Smack My Bitch Up, pairing them with a hammering bassline. These moments of respite among 17 tracks are too few. Most of the record is palatable but unremarkable – an algorithmic play for radio airtime.

4/17/2022,"“Ispent a lot of time wishing I wasn’t gay,” the Years & Years frontman, Olly Alexander, told fans at 2019’s Glastonbury festival. “So now, it’s like I’m making up for lost time, you know?” Standing in front of a crowd full of colourful flags, wearing a sparkly string vest, with the stage behind him emblazoned with the words “queer is beautiful”, Alexander gave a rousing speech and thanked the generations who fought for his rights. It was a queer and joyous image. It’s not difficult to see why members of a community that has been erased and shamed would embrace an aesthetic of defiant happiness. To some, it’s a form of resistance. The existence of a so-called “queer aesthetic” has been debated for decades. While there is little consensus about what exactly this aesthetic is, there is more agreement that queerness is constantly evolving. Right now, we’re seeing the dominance of a joyful form of peacocking. Pop music’s gay sexual revolution was spearheaded by Lil Nas X lapdancing the devil in an assortment of wigs, but the stylistic choices of LGBTQ+ musicians such as Janelle Monáe, Troye Sivan and Rina Sawayama are similarly attention-grabbing. Elsewhere, RuPaul’s Drag Race has transformed the art of drag into a mainstream cultural phenomenon. The show has created a wave of drag superstars, each with an inspiring narrative and signature aesthetic. Netflix’s makeover show Queer Eye trades on an attempt at queer joy too, with its cast of “experts” combining design and emotional coaching to revamp people’s lives. What is driving this increased visibility? Perhaps it’s related to what Alexander said at Glastonbury about “making up for lost time”. After so many years of LGBTQ+ people being minimised, or their self-expression being confined to queer bars, clubs and Pride parades, there is a joy in taking up as much space as possible. This mainstream amplification is also driven by capitalism assigning a higher value to visual displays of queerness. In 2021, the artist Brenna Drury and photographer Julia Comita created an exhibition of vintage-style faux beauty adverts starring LGBTQ+ models, to highlight how brands had marginalised them in decades gone by. But now, the trans author Paris Lees is starring in Pantene adverts, and campaigns for Rihanna’s inclusive Savage X Fenty line are unmistakably queer. YouTube has spawned a generation of LGBTQ+ makeup moguls, such as NikkieTutorials. Drag Race isn’t just a reality show – it’s a global brand with conventions, tours and merchandise. And Queer Eye’s “fab five” are a squad of mega-sponsored influencers with their own products and platforms. Gay culture’s visual codes are being consumed much more widely too. Jockstraps – a sportswear garment that was emblematic of American masculinity – were first popularised among gay men on the pages of Physique Pictorial, a “bodybuilding” magazine that emerged in the conservative 1950s and functioned as gay pornography when distributing such materials was illegal. Now, the garment’s gayness is a fairly mainstream norm that brands are happy to profit from. Underwear giant Calvin Klein now sells multicoloured Pride-themed jockstraps and, in 2020, Lady Gaga delighted her gay fans when she released a limited edition Chromatica jockstrap to promote her album. Queer culture is repositioning itself to question this new normal. I saw this for myself during the peak of the pandemic, when larger Pride celebrations were cancelled in London. Instead, I attended a Black Trans Lives Matter march in summer 2020, followed by a Trans Pride protest in 2021. Here, there were no indefensible sponsors or branded floats. The marches were angrier and definitely more like a protest than party, but somehow still more joyful than the pedestrian #LoveIsLove campaigns. It felt closer to what Pride must have felt like in the past. The anarchistic energy of these protests reminded me of the Rebel Dykes, a group of queer women and trans people who founded Chain Reaction, the world’s first known lesbian S&M club, in 1980s London. The group’s punk aesthetic was intertwined with their politics: they regularly organised demos against the Thatcher government’s Aids response, cuts to public services and the homophobic section 28 legislation – including an invasion of BBC News and abseiling into the House of Lords. The Rebel Dykes were angry, but there was also something gleeful about their rejection of gendered stereotypes and their pursuit of a life that centred around pleasure and freedom. Around this time, New Romanticism – a gender-bending aesthetic embodied by musicians such as Boy George – was mainstream in the UK. In the conservative 1980s, there was an escapism and a perceived subversiveness to it. But the movement has later been interpreted by some, such as the style commentator Peter York, to be a tacit acceptance of Thatcherite values such as individualism and materialism. The reappraisals of New Romanticism make me wonder how we’ll come to view the politics of queer joy via Paid Partnership, which is being put on a similar pedestal at a time when there is still so much to feel angry about politically – such as the UK government’s cynical attempts to weaponise trans issues and divide LGBTQ+ people. Last weekend, Boris Johnson’s shameful failure to include trans people in a ban on conversion practices brought LGBTQ+ people to the streets in protest. Just like the grassroots Pride marches of the pandemic, it felt like fresh air in oxygen-deprived lungs. The scenes underlined to me that expressions of queerness feel most joyful when partnered with that sense of disruption, or even anger, towards the wider world and LGBTQ+ culture itself. And I’m not alone: after a consultation with the local community, Manchester Pride has confirmed that this year’s event will no longer feature an expensive pop concert. Instead, it will refocus on Pride’s activist roots as a protest. Even Drag Race, now the pinnacle of mainstream queer representation, has been forced to change: cisgender women, trans people and even straight men now compete. The judges once criticised contestants who weren’t pristine and feminine, but now a messier, androgynous drag reigns supreme. As queer culture evolves, it will continue to challenge political and visual conventions – including its own relationship to the mainstream. What comes next is uncertain. But whatever it looks like, no matter who tries to stifle it, queer joy will find a way of shining through.

4/17/2022,"Regulators will investigate cases where an epilepsy drug that can cause birth defects has been prescribed without proper warnings, in light of reports that pregnant women are continuing to be given it. Sodium valproate is a drug used to treat epilepsy, and is also used in some people with bipolar disorder or migraines. However, it has been associated with a raised risk of birth defects and developmental problems if taken by pregnant women. Some unborn babies continue to be exposed to the medication: the latest figures reveal 247 women had exposed pregnancies between April 2018 and September 2021. According to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), exposure to the drug during pregnancy has declined in recent years, with a report from the valproate registry revealing the number of pregnant women prescribed sodium valproate fell by 51% between the 2018-19 financial year and the 2020-21 financial year. But an investigation by the Sunday Times has also revealed reports of the drug being issued without information leaflets, or with warnings obscured. Dr Alison Cave, the MHRA’s chief safety officer, said that sodium valproate should not be taken by anyone who had the potential to have a baby unless they were using effective contraception. She added that every woman taking valproate, and their healthcare professional, needed to sign a yearly risk acknowledgment form. She said: “Valproate use in pregnancy carries significant risks of harm to the baby and it should not be taken by any individual of child-bearing potential unless they have a pregnancy prevention programme in place, which includes use of effective contraception. “We have also worked with the Department of Health and Social Care to seek views from the UK public on requirements to ensure medicines that contain sodium valproate are always dispensed in the original manufacturer’s packaging, so that the important safety information on risks in pregnancy is provided with every dispensed prescription.. “If there are examples where this information has not been provided we would investigate this.” Matthew Walker, a professor of neurology at University College London and chair of trustees at Epilepsy Research UK, said it is completely unacceptable that women with epilepsy are not being warned of the potential harmful effects of sodium valproate during pregnancy. “Unfortunately, for some women, valproate is the only drug that successfully controls their epilepsy and more research is needed to identify safe and effective alternatives,” he said. “Switching to less effective drugs is often not a reasonable alternative given the high epilepsy-related mortality in pregnancy. Most people with epilepsy do not have access to doctors with an expertise in epilepsy so that they can be offered the best and most up-to-date advice.” Dr Rebecca Bromley, a research fellow and paediatric neuropsychologist at the University of Manchester, told the Guardian babies exposed to sodium valproate were not only at a higher risk of birth defects but also cognitive and social difficulties. She said: “The higher the dose of the medication the higher the risk to the child. However, even at more modest doses we can see poorer intellectual and social difficulties.” It had taken longer for the latter to be investigated, she added, despite the large impact on daily life – including challenges with reasoning, attention learning and language skills. Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said patients taking sodium valproate should not stop without seeking medical advice, and should talk to their consultant or GP if they were planning to have a baby. “It is vital that all medications have instructions on how to take them, and that warnings are clearly visible on or in the packaging, and we would encourage all patients to read these before taking them,” he added. “It is concerning that the Sunday Times investigation found instances of sodium valproate being dispensed without appropriate information visible.” It is not the first time sodium valproate has been at the heart of a public health scandal. The drug was one of three interventions that were the focus of the Cumberlege Review, launched by then-health secretary Jeremy Hunt in 2018. The review estimated 20,000 people in the UK had been exposed to the drug as developing babies, revealing many women reported that they had not been warned of the risks by their doctor, were reassured the drug was safe, or were even told that should their baby subsequently have problems these could be “fixed”. After the report, the Valproate Safety Implementation Group was set up. Last year, the NHS sent a letter to all women and girls aged 12 and over who had a current prescription for sodium valproate, flagging the risks posed to unborn babies. An NHS spokesperson said the aim of the expert group was to help reduce the use of sodium valproate by women who could get pregnant by 50% next year. Hunt has compared the use of sodium valproate among pregnant women to the thalidomide scandal, in which pregnant women were given a drug to counter morning sickness that turned out to cause serious birth defects. “It beggars belief that after so many warnings this still hasn’t been sorted: this is a major risk to patient safety and ministers must order an immediate fix to prevent any more avoidable harm,” he told the Sunday Times. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Patient safety is a priority and we take all reports and inquiries on this matter extremely seriously. “As set out in our response, we have accepted the majority of the recommendations in Baroness Cumberlege’s report. We want to improve the future safety of medicines and medical devices – ensuring they are used in line with the latest evidence of best practice – and there are wider forms of redress available for those who need it.”",News/Society,MHRA to look into cases of unsafe epilepsy drug being given to pregnant women,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/17/sodium-valproate-mhra-to-look-into-cases-of-unsafe-epilepsy-drug-being-given-to-pregnant-women
4/17/2022,"It being Easter weekend, Saturday Night Live opens with a message from the Easter Bunny (Bowen Yang). Almost immediately, the “freakiest” holiday character turns things over to a random assortment of public figures. Dr Anthony Fauci (Kate McKinnon) compares Covid cases to Jesus (“They’ve risen again!”), while Marjorie Taylor Greene (Cecily Strong) worries that “between the pastels and the jellybeans, this holiday has gotten a little too LGBQRST for me”. New York City mayor Eric Adams (Chris Redd), boasts about catching the Brooklyn subway shooter, even though “it took 30 hours and the suspect turned himself in”, while Elon Musk (Mikey Day), attempts to buy the holiday. Britney Spears (Chloe Fineman) does a lot of twirling and Jared Leto (Kyle Mooney), begs people not to review his terrible new movie Morbius. Finally, former president Donald Trump (James Austin Johnson) interrupts the proceedings to ramble about Reese’s Eggs (“I like Reese, I’m very good friends with Reese…”), Cap’n Crunch (“He was very rude to me at Count Chocula’s 500th birthday”) and Little Caesar’s (“I told him to say, ‘Pizza! Pizza!’ He used to say it once and I said we should be saying it twice!”) Austin’s Trump and Redd’s Adams aside, these are among the worst, most obnoxious, and straight up laziest impressions in the cast’s repertory. The writing sinks to match them on several fronts, from the hypocrisy of lampooning (however lightly) Musk less than a year after the show gave its entire platform over to him, to the softening of Taylor Greene by portraying her as a harmless kook, to the attempt to have it both ways by pointing out how useless New York’s law enforcement while simultaneously parroting their “rising crime” talking point. Tonight’s episode sees Lizzo pulling double duty as host and music guest. The singer-songwriter promises to “break the record for the amount of times bitch is said on live TV”, before discussing her recent Ted talk on the history of twerking (“I’m like if Einstein could make that ass clap”), batting down rumors about her love life (“They think I’m collecting members of One Direction like Infinity Stones”) and encouraging the audience to love themselves in order to manifest their dreams. That last bit is truly groan inducing – this is supposed to be a comedy show, not an Affirmational Instagram post – but Lizzo shows a good flair for comic delivery. She also seems serious about her earlier promise, with the Bitch Count numbering eight by monologue’s end. Guess That is a game show where contestants have to answer rapid fire trivia questions. Things start off normal enough, until Lizzo’s contestant botches a question and hijacks the show, refusing to admit she was wrong, accusing the host of gaslighting her and attempting to overthrow him as “Mayor of Game Town”. This last gambit wins the support of her fellow contestant. It’s a welcome spin on the usual game show narrative and promising start to the episode proper, but things take an immediate nosedive for the next sketch, the latest in the irredeemably awful Tik Tok scrolls. Rather than come up with anything original, the show simply recreates – read: steals—the latest viral videos from the social media platform. Everyone involved in this should be ashamed to call themselves comedians. Somehow, this is followed by an even worse sketch. We flashback to Interscope Records Studios in the spring of 2008, where the Black Eyed Peas are recording songs for their latest album. Their producers help them brainstorm lyrics for several singles, including the ridiculously simplistic Boom Boom Pow, the extremely random party anthem Tonight, and the highly problematic Let’s Get Retarded, which would later be changed to Let’s Get It Started. The problems with this sketch are numerous: from the lack of narrative cohesion (the producers are worried about the song’s baffling lyrics one second, then ecstatic about them the next), to Lizzo’s constant breaking, to the cowardly attempt to have it both ways by centering jokes around Let’s Get Retarded offensiveness without actually saying the offending lyrics (thereby putting the onus fully on the audience). Beyond any of this, this sketch speaks to how utterly stuck in the past the show is. It’s not that SNL should refrain from joking about older pop culture – one of its greatest sketches was centered around a 24-year-old Blue Oyster Cult track after all – but this brings nothing original or fresh to the table. It merely falls back on obvious observations and tired impressions 14 years past their sell-by date. It appears the writer’s minds were stuck in the mid aughts, because the next sketch finds a couple’s (Lizzo, Day) first date interrupted by a community of the dancing old geezers “from the Six Flags commercials”, a piece of pop cultural ephemera that first appeared in 2004. This is followed by a new Please Don’t Destroy segment. Ben, Martin and John attempt to help Lizzo break through a case of writer’s block by coming up with a “black woman anthem” for her to sing on the show. All they can come up with are sad “white guy anthems”, The Sopranos theme, one of Lizzo’s old tracks and a song about Martin’s girlfriend looking like Spongebob. They’re just about to give up when Lizzo realizes that the sketch they initially planned to pitch her – about a horny zookeeper – actually makes for a great song. As is becoming increasingly clear, the more the PDD segments rely on guest stars, the less they work, with this one being the most forgettable yet. On Weekend Update, the show continues to have its cake and eat it too by simultaneously poking fun at/kissing the ass of Elon Musk, with Michael Che saying of his failed attempt to buy Twitter in order to lessen its free speech rules, “that’s how badly white guys want to use the N-word”, Colin Jost questions why someone who’s “building electric cars [and] going to Mars” would even waste his time on so paltry an app. (A side dig at Meghan Markle is sure to earn Jost plenty of angry comments on said platform come tomorrow). In case it wasn’t already very clear, whatever anti-establishment bonafides the show ever had are long gone. Jost eventually welcomes this edition of Update’s sole guest, his personal driver, Cesar Perez (Melissa Villaseñor), who wants to try out some of his stand-up material. Perez fires off a series of zingers all about his nerdy, lizard and masturbation-obsessed nephew Carlito, only to immediately succumb to remorse. His tearful apologies make for a gently funny send up of Latinos specific brand of Catholic guilt. That said, this character segment is dragged down by several extremely dated jokes – this time via continual references to The Mind of Mencia. Update signs off with a tribute to late, great alum Gilbert Gottfried, who passed away earlier this week. Next, two party planners in ancient Egypt do a dress rehearsal for an orgy they’re throwing for their mad God-King (eventually revealed to be a young child). The hedonistic hired acts include “sensuous woman and her tender boy,” a twinkish fire eater, “old woman caked in make up with rotten teeth who laughs”, a trio of good-looking swingers, a well-endowed fan waver, a goat wrangler (with real goat), and a “puckish imp” who’s older than he advertised. This feels like a half-formed to begin with, and the cast’s constant breaking doesn’t help things. The live goat is pretty neat though. Then, Lizzo plays a flautist auditioning for first chair in the DeVry University symphony orchestra. Her musical skills are second to none, but she can only perform while twerking. That’s all there is to it. Given Lizzo’s association with the dance move, it makes sense the show would build a sketch around it, but surely they could have come up with something better than this. The final sketch of the night sees a group of friends celebrating one of their own (Andrew Dismukes) for quitting his job to cash in on his investments. Their moral support quickly erodes once said investments are revealed to be his collection of Beanie Babies. It makes sense the episode would wrap up with yet another tired premise centered around a cultural phenomenon several years – decades, in this case – behind us. Her constant breaking aside, Lizzo made an adequate host, but everything surrounding her – from the terrible cold open, to the truly dire middle section, to the nonstop stream of extremely dated pop culture references – was unbearable. This was by far the worst episode of the season and possibly the worst since Musk hosted almost a year ago. (Fitting that he should feature so heavily throughout tonight’s show). It’s a good thing the show is off for the reminder of the month, although it’s doubtful the break will do much good. At this point, Saturday Night Live isn’t merely in need of some course correction, but some real heavy-duty soul searching.",Arts/Television & radio,Saturday Night Live: Lizzo fails to add juice to a dated and dire episode,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/17/saturday-night-live-lizzo
