3/21/2022,"(Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday Europe would be hit hard in the event of an embargo on Russian oil, striking the continent's energy balance, but would not affect the United States. Some European Union foreign ministers are pushing for an oil embargo as part of a possible fifth round of sanctions against Russi, in an effort to punish Moscow over events in Ukraine. ""Such an embargo would very seriously impact the global oil market, very badly impact energy balance on the European continent,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a daily conference call. Diplomats have said a Russian chemical weapons attack in Ukraine, or a heavy bombardment of its capital Kyiv, could be a trigger for an energy embargo. Russia says it targets military, not civilian infrastructure. Moscow itself has warned that EU sanctions on Russian oil could prompt it to close a gas pipeline to Europe. For now, the 27-nation EU, which relies on Russia for 40% of its gas, with Germany among the most dependent of the bloc's large economies, is divided on how to tackle the energy issue. ""Americans would remain as they are and would feel much better than Europeans (in the event of oil embargo). This would be hard for Europeans - such a decision would hit everyone,"" Peskov said. Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a ""special operation"" to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

3/21/2022,"Mar. 19—As the Rev. John Ubel returned home from an early-morning run on a Thursday last May, he noticed a fox scurrying across the grounds of the Cathedral of St. Paul. ""That's kind of neat,"" he thought. Only later did the priest realize — in what has become known as the story of the Cathedral Fox — that this was the first sign that something was terribly wrong. A wrong he would help right. A CRY FOR HELP The second sign of trouble came in the dark. ""The next night, Friday night, I was returning from a wedding reception,"" Ubel recalls. ""It was later at night, close to 10, and I heard some sounds. I thought, 'That must be the fox I heard yesterday.' The sound was a bit alarming."" The crisis became clear the next morning. ""I got up very, very early on Saturday morning and heard the noise again,"" Ubel said. He followed the sound — a crying — into the bushes and realized a fox had fallen about 15 feet into the depths of a cavernous version of a window well of the Cathedral, an area that was framed in iron fencing. ""It looked a lot smaller than the fox I had seen,"" Ubel said of his discovery. ""And then it dawned on me ... 'Wait a minute ... that must have been the mother that was running around.'"" Had she been distraught, trying to rescue her kit — her pup — after the fall? There was no way for her to reach the kit. But Ubel could help. While he was unsure of catching or trapping the wild animal, he knew there must be people out who could. So he picked up his phone and started making calls. HELP WANTED Unfortunately, it was a weekend. ""I made calls all over the place in St. Paul and Ramsey County,"" Ubel says. ""No offense to anyone, but no one was getting back to me."" By the time he started calling for help, Ubel estimates that the fox had been trapped for at least 48 hours without food or water. ""I decided I'd better do something myself,"" he says. But what to feed a fox? ""I did a Google search,"" Ubel says. After a run to the grocery store, the fox had some bananas, dried fruit plus a puddle of water to drink. The priest resumed his round of phone calls. By Sunday evening, though, the fox had squeezed behind a window grate; it seemed weaker. ""It was not moving anymore,"" says Ubel. HELP ARRIVES During the priest's weekend calls, he left a message with the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of Minnesota. The Roseville nonprofit is a veterinary hospital for wildlife — but it has no ambulance service; it requires the public to drop off injured wildlife. On Sunday night, the priest connected with Tami Vogel, the center's communications director. ""She told me that the city is very good about helping and would probably come out first thing on Monday,"" he recalls. Ubel didn't think the fox could survive another night. ""I think the animal will be dead by then,"" he said. After the call ended, Ubel tried to focus on what was in front of him: dinner at his mom's house in Highland Park. He must have been pushing his food around. ""You're thinking about that animal, aren't you?"" asked his mom, Gix. Minutes later, the phone rang. Two of the center's staff members had offered to come and help after they clocked out. ""I left the food on my plate,"" Ubel said, ""and rushed back to the Cathedral.' RESCUED With the help of a ladder, one of the volunteers descended into the window well of the Cathedral and, within moments, masterfully untangled the fox from his hiding spot. The crisis was clear. ""As soon as they came up, they were gone,"" Ubel said. ""I thought, 'Wow, they weren't in a talking mood. This must be serious.' "" It was. ""The fox was literally at death's door,"" says Vogel. ""His blood pressure was so low, it didn't register."" It was rescued just in time. ""They told me this animal would not have made it through another night,"" Ubel says. HOPE The fox's future was unclear. ""We honestly didn't think it was going to survive,"" says Vogel. They did know this: He was a gray fox, not as well-known as its distant cousin, the red fox. Gray foxes are typically born later in the spring, but this fox was already about three months old. Besides being critically emaciated, his bloodwork also revealed a case of lead toxicity — lead poisoning. Back at the Cathedral, the days crept by as the priest awaited news he wasn't certain would be good. ""I didn't want to bother them,"" he says. ""And I was worried they'd say, 'I'm sorry, but ...' "" After three days of critical care, though, the fox's blood pressure became strong enough to register. He was still fighting for his life, though. ""Time will tell if the fox will survive the trauma his body is going through,"" read a post on the wildlife center's Facebook page. Ubel saw the post, which was published a week after the fox was admitted. ""That's when I knew,"" said the priest, ""that there was hope."" NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC As he moved out of critical care, the fox continued his recovery — with humans increasingly at the perimeter of his life. ""It's not like he was a domesticated fox, if there is such a thing,"" Vogel said. ""We are very hands-off with our patients — we spend no time with the animals other than treatment, or giving them fresh food and water. A fox bonded with humans cannot be released into the wild, which is a very bad thing."" But could he be released? To answer this question, he'd move on to an independent wildlife rehabilitator for the ""outdoor conditioning"" phase of his rehab. Before he left, on July 1, someone arrived to take his photo. This is where National Geographic enters our story. PHOTO ARK Have you heard of the Photo Ark? It's an effort by Joel Sartore, a National Geographic photographer, to take portraits of about 20,000 species living in zoos and wildlife sanctuaries across the world — and also, occasionally, at the Minnesota Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Roseville. ""I think we linked up with him at the National Wildlife Rehabilitation Association's annual symposium, he was a guest speaker one year,"" Vogel says. ""He found out about our patient load. He has a list of species he needs to photograph, so when we get a patient he needs, we contact him and let him know. He will do his best to get a photo of the patient while it's in our care."" That's how it worked with the fox, although the fox may not have realized it. ""He uses a blind, almost,"" Vogel says. ""There's no human interaction other than transferring the fox into the container for the photo. It's amazing to see Joel at work. He has a very, very good eye; he knows what he wants, he's organized and efficient, putting minimal stress on the animal. ""A lot of people want 'the photo,' but Joel does not put undue stress on the animal for the photo — he's quick, quiet and efficient, and that's why we work with him."" THE PHOTO In an email to the Pioneer Press, Sartore explained his process. ""I always photograph animals on a white or black background so there are no distractions in the photograph, it's just the animal and the viewer,"" he wrote. ""There's also no size comparison, so this juvenile fox is as important as any other species that I've ever photographed, giving all species an equal voice. Throughout the shoot, the comfort and safety of the animal is most important, so I minimize talking and try to get the shoot done as quickly as possible. The entire shoot lasts just a few minutes."" In just a few minutes, what was his impression of the fox? ""The fox was just adorable, of course, and I felt good knowing he was in very good hands with the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of Minnesota (WRCMN),"" Sartore wrote. That's evident from the photo: In 46 days — about six weeks — the gray fox had transformed from fading away in a window well. clinically emaciated and poisoned with lead, to a creature with fur so fluffy and eyes so bright that he almost looks like an artist's rendering. Which, for a moment, he was. The artist's mission goes beyond the image itself, though. ""I'm very honored to have been able to partner with the WRCMN for many years now for the Photo Ark,"" Sartore writes. ""The ultimate goal of my project is to document every species in the world's zoos and wildlife sanctuaries, inspire action through education, and help save wildlife by supporting on-the-ground conservation efforts. The Photo Ark gives animals the chance to be seen, and have their stories told, while there's still time to save them and their habitats. In my images, I hope viewers will look deeply into the eyes of these animals and see they are all important and so worthy of preserving. Readers can learn more about the project at natgeo.org/photoark."" REHAB After his photo shoot, the fox was taken to Connie and Nick LaFond's farm in Hennepin County, a 45-acre property located between Maple Plain and Delano, about 35 miles from St. Paul. Here, Connie LaFond, with the help of her husband, works with foxes and other wildlife to prepare them, if appropriate, to be released back into the wild. It's a passion project for LaFond, who is licensed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources to rehabilitate wildlife but has a day job as a certified public accountant. ""I was always interested in wildlife,"" LaFond says. ""Back in the 1980s, when the WRC was just a room at the University of Minnesota, my husband and I took a class at the Humane Society in Golden Valley on wildlife rehab. That year, the Humane Society got a litter of foxes and didn't know anybody to take them. We said, 'Well, we have a small farm, we could take them.' They said, 'Good, here.' "" Since then, the couple has moved to a larger farm and, while they work with a variety of wildlife, they are known as specialists at working with foxes (both red and gray). ""The fox pens are large and come with dead trees, brush piles and other things fox would see in their habitat,"" LaFond says. It was clear this fox was in need of conditioning. ""Because of his intense treatment, he hadn't moved around a lot,"" LaFond says. ""He seemed a little weak.' As summer deepened, the fox reconnected with his wildness, climbing trees and hunting prey. ""He got better and better and stronger and stronger,"" she says. He also made a friend, another gray fox transferred from WRC. Originally from Wildwoods, a rehabilitation center in Duluth, this fox was recovering from a broken leg. ""The two them got along great,"" LaFond says. ""They spent a lot of time climbing and carrying on."" LaFond was not surprised that the foxes were thriving. ""Foxes are really intelligent, they've very tough and they want to live,"" she says. ""Compared to cottontails, which you have to feed very carefully and just the right amount or they'll die, foxes can survive almost anything. With fluids and food and medication, they can go from surviving to thriving, it's just amazing."" It was time to release these survivors. RELEASED The Cathedral fox did not return to city life. Instead, on Aug. 18, he and his pal from Duluth were transported to a property about three hours from St. Paul in Cass County, Minn. The hardest part of the journey was probably crating them. ""By this stage,"" LaFond says, ""they are not friendly — that's what we want, we want them to be afraid and wild, not to come up to people."" The foxes would never know it, but the person whose habitat was opened up to them was a friend. ""The private landowner has about 300 acres with the mixed habitat that gray foxes need, and no hunting or trapping is allowed,"" LaFond says. ""He was thrilled to have gray foxes in the habitat."" It was in this place, three months after he was rescued, that the fox of Cathedral Hill was set free. ""A friend we work with did the transport,"" LaFond says. ""She said it went great. Basically, you just wave goodbye as they run off into the woods."" A bittersweet goodbye? ""I do have mixed feelings about it,"" says LaFond. ""But we give them a chance they would not have had otherwise, and they are as prepared as they could be."" GIFTS It's been almost a year now since Ubel first spotted a fox on the grounds of the Cathedral. As another spring begins to bloom, the priest says he's become more aware of nature and wildlife all around him; it's one of the gifts of the gray fox. ""Creation is a gift from God that we do not always take the time to enjoy and fully appreciate because we are so busy,"" Ubel says. ""Animals are one of the gifts in the background of our lives. The fox has taught me to more observant and aware of my surroundings; I am more likely to see the beauty of nature. Since he helped save the fox, Ubel has become a supporter of WRC and its work, as well as of Sartore's Photo Ark. He also shared the story of the fox with parishioners in a Cathedral bulletin post called ""'Foxes Have Dens' (Most of the Time): The Beauty of God's Creation."" ""This animal clearly captured my heart,"" says Ubel. ""He captured everyone's hearts."" LaFond agrees. ""When you think about it, it's an amazing story,"" she says. ""Everyone involved went to pretty extreme measures to save this fox.""

3/21/2022,"By Julie Ingwersen and P.J. Huffstutter CHICAGO (Reuters) - After Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent global wheat futures soaring, U.S. farmer Vance Ehmke was eager to sell his grain. Local prices shot up roughly 30% to nearly $12 a bushel, about the highest Ehmke could recall in 45 years of farming near the western Kansas town of Healy. Instead of reaping a windfall, Ehmke found a commodities market turned upside down. He and his wife Louise told Reuters they couldn't sell a nickel of their upcoming summer wheat harvest for future delivery. Futures prices for corn and wheat had rocketed so abruptly that many along the complex chain of grain handling - local farm cooperatives, grain elevators, flour millers and exporters - stopped buying for fear they couldn't resell at a profit. Others couldn't afford an industry-wide risk-management strategy known as hedging that keeps global commodities markets moving. Missiles falling in Ukraine had rocked that system, sending middlemen scrambling to shore up positions in the futures market that were costing them millions of dollars per day. ""More than anything, the market is just in a panic,"" Andrew Jackson, a Kentucky grain merchandiser, told Reuters. Many of these players continue to hold back on purchases to see how the Eastern European conflict shakes out: Russia is the world's top wheat exporter and Ukraine is a major global supplier of both wheat and corn. While some North American millers have said they have enough grain on hand from past harvests to continue producing for several months, prolonged or repeated disruptions to grain trading could eventually contribute to already-inflated food prices. Meanwhile, the inability to sell some of their winter wheat - whose harvest starts in June - is putting the squeeze on U.S. farmers. Growers like the Ehmkes need cash now to pay for seed and fertilizer ahead of spring planting, as well as for land rent and tax bills coming due. Fertilizer bills alone are expected to jump 12% this year, after rising 17% last year, according to American Farm Bureau Federation and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data. If American farmers decide to cut back, that could curb yields for the fall harvest at a time when the world may soon need more grain. Developing countries are particularly vulnerable to supply shortages and high grain prices, said Don Roose, president of agricultural broker U.S. Commodities in Iowa. ""Emerging markets like Africa could have less bread to eat,"" Roose said. SHORTS VS LONGS The unusual situation that throttled the Ehmkes stems from the system of hedging that U.S. grain growers and processors have long used to insure themselves against price swings. For every bushel of grain they commit to buy, purchasers sell an equal amount of bushels in the futures market as a hedge to protect themselves against losses. These commercial players are the traditional ""shorts,"" or sellers, in the futures market. On the other side are futures buyers, or ""longs."" These players typically are speculators such as hedge funds and investment banks not involved in the physical grain-handling business. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, which Moscow dubbed a ""special operation,"" speculators aggressively bought wheat and corn futures, especially the nearby May contracts. The price of May wheat on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) jumped 54% in just nine trading days, from $8.84-3/4 per bushel on Feb. 23 to $13.63-1/2 on March 8. Russia and Ukraine together supply about 26% of the world's wheat exports, according to the latest USDA data. Shipments through the Black Sea have already been disrupted. When futures shoot higher, commercial grain sellers accrue paper losses on their short positions. That's not necessarily a disaster, as the physical grain they have purchased is rising in value too. But until they can sell the grain and close their futures positions, they can get squeezed financially. In recent weeks, many have faced so-called margin calls from their futures brokers, forcing them to inject enormous sums into their commodity trading accounts to cover their losses. ""It's a massive headache that could turn into a problem if they do not have their financial house in order,"" said Chad Hart, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. CALLING THE BANKER The wheat rally clobbered buyers of other crops, too. Landus Cooperative, the largest agriculture cooperative in Iowa, briefly suspended its cash bids to buy corn and soybeans on March 9. Chief Executive Matt Carstens said Landus also tripled its credit line with CoBank, a top U.S. agricultural lender, to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in margin calls during the rally and ensure its business remained healthy. CoBank has delivered more than $4.5 billion in loans and credit to customers to deal with margin calls and grain purchases in January and February alone, Eric Itambo, CoBank's chief banking officer, told Reuters. Though spot CBOT wheat futures have cooled in recent days, slipping back below $11 a bushel, the futures market has not been this volatile since 2008, when food shortages worldwide sparked riots in some countries. Back in Kansas, the Ehmkes are eyeing a worsening drought that is hurting the winter wheat crop currently in the ground. Still, they think they might get another chance to sell wheat at $12 or more with the Ukraine conflict showing no sign of abating. ""Just a whole bunch of things are telling us the price of wheat could be substantially higher than what it is right now,"" Vance Ehmke said. (Reporting by Julie Ingwersen in Chicago, and P.J.

3/21/2022,"The CEO of Yara International, a major fertilizer producer, told WSJ there will be a food crisis. Bloomberg Green Markets North America Fertilizer Price Index jumped 10% Friday to an all-time high. Sweeping sanctions over the Ukraine war are limiting fertilizer supplies from major producers in Russia. EU sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine are driving up fertilizer prices, leading to what one CEO said is going to be a food crisis. ""We are going to have a food crisis. It's a question of how large,"" said Svein Tore Holsether, the CEO of major fertilizer producer Yara International, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. His comments came as the Bloomberg Green Markets North America Fertilizer Price Index jumped almost 10% on Friday to an all-time high. On March 11, Norway-based Yara International announced that, due to EU sanctions, it would no longer be sourcing supplies from Russia. But Holsether said he was weighing a moral dilemma even before sanctions hit, as he knew cutting Russian supplies would contribute to food inflation. Russia accounted for almost one-fifth of 2021 fertilizer exports, according to Trade Data Monitor and Bloomberg's Green Markets. Russia is also a top exporter in key fertilizer ingredients such as urea, ammonia, and potash, per trade outlet Argus Media. The loss of Russian fertilizer supply is expected to cause severe strain to the supply of crop nutrient, which was already under pressure before the war as European fertilizer producers cut output due to high gas prices and as freight rates soared, according to Bloomberg. There are few alternatives available. ""Replacing their volumes would take nearly half a decade at the very best, and in some cases prove nearly impossible as Russia is a large source of mineral deposits found in few other global locations,"" Alexis Maxwell, an analyst for Bloomberg's Green Markets, said on March 5, per the media outlet.

3/21/2022,"(Corrects spelling of ""suspicions"" in second paragraph) SHANGHAI, March 20 (Reuters) - China stands on the right side of history over the Ukraine crisis as time will tell, and its position is in line with the wishes of most countries, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said. ""China will never accept any external coercion or pressure, and opposes any unfounded accusations and suspicions against China,"" Wang told reporters on Saturday evening, according to a statement published by his ministry on Sunday. Wang's comments came after U.S. President Joe Biden warned his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Friday of ""consequences"" if Beijing gave material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. During the video call, Xi told Biden the war in Ukraine must end as soon as possible and called on NATO nations to hold a dialogue with Moscow. He did not, however, assign blame to Russia, according to Beijing's statements about the call. Wang said the most important message Xi sent was that China has always been a force for maintaining world peace. ""We have always stood for maintaining peace and opposing war,"" Wang said, reiterating that China will make independent judgements. ""China's position is objective and fair, and is in line with the wishes of most countries. Time will prove that China's claims are on the right side of history."" Also on Saturday, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said that sanctions imposed by Western nations on Russia over Ukraine were increasingly ""outrageous"". The United States and its European and Asian allies have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia for the Feb. 24 invasion of its neighbour, which they call a war of aggression by President Vladimir Putin. He says he launched a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. While saying it recognises Ukraine's sovereignty, Beijing has repeatedly said that Russia has legitimate security concerns that should be addressed and urged a diplomatic solution to the conflict.
