3/16/2022,"By Elaine Lies TOKYO, March 16 (Reuters) - Japanese accountant Masamitsu has not travelled or gone to the cinema in years and rarely eats out. Instead, his annual salary of about $34,000 goes to support his family and has risen by just $4 a year for nearly a decade. ""I can't save, I have nothing at all put by for my old age. I'll just have to keep on working,"" said the 50-year-old, who declined to give his last name out of concern for his job at a small company that works in event planning. ""After I retire from this company, I'll do anything I can get. Maybe work as a security guard."" Masamitsu's plight mirrors that of many workers at small and medium-sized firms in Japan, where the average salary in 2020 was $38,515, little changed from the 1990s and well below the average of $49,165 in countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has urged profitable companies to boost wages at spring wage negotiations, when managements of blue chip firms meet key unions for talks to fix wages in the coming year, setting a guideline for most other companies. This year's talks are expected to wrap up on Wednesday. Masamitsu, who was trained in accounting at a vocational school, switched jobs at age 43, in a move relatively unusual for Japanese employees, after his previous employer cut salaries. After a long series of unsuccessful interviews, he felt lucky to land his current job, only to be told upfront that raises would be only 500 yen ($4.25) a year for the first decade. ""Given my age, the base pay actually wasn't too bad, there were other places that were lower,"" he said. ""And I was told that after 10 years, it'd go up by 5,000 yen a year."" Masamitsu's monthly pay, along with allowances common in Japan, amounts to about 250,000 yen, and he gets a bonus of two months' pay twice a year for a yearly total of roughly 4 million yen ($34,000). ""It's kind of unfortunate it doesn't rise more, even though I'm working hard,"" he said. From this sum he supports his wife, who works part-time to supplement their income, and a daughter who is just about to complete high school. For recreation, he and some friends do yoga from YouTube videos, though he occasionally buys a one-day gym pass to take yoga classes. ""I'd have liked to have had another child, but the one has taken everything we have,"" he said. He has little hope that Kishida's urging will change much. ""This kind of thing doesn't really reach people in places like me,"" he said. ""Officials say a lot of things that don't really work out.""

Spoiler alert: They tend to spread more bacteria compared to just towels.” According to the Harvard Health blog, a 2018 study by the University of Connecticut and Quinnipiac University found that exposure to hot hand dryers exponentially grew bacteria colonies within a matter of seconds. “Every time a lidless toilet is flushed, it aerosolizes a fine mist of microbes. This fecal cloud may disperse over an area as large as 6 square meters (65 square feet),” Harvard Health stated. This means that each time someone flushes a toilet, particles of fecal bacteria spread through the air. When the bacteria comes in contact with a hot hand dryer, it multiplies.

The Emergency Service said three such bombs have been removed in one day, requiring incredible precision to execute safely. This is the tense moment a large unexploded Russian bomb was delicately removed from a block of flats in a city in Ukraine. The discovery was made as Russian forces continue to strike residential areas of Ukraine as part of its ongoing invasion. The unexploded device landed in an apartment block in the city of Chernihiv. It was extracted by Ukrainian bomb disposal experts, who used a crane to carry the bomb out of the damaged building and on to the back of a lorry. Video footage of the operation was posted on Twitter by the State Emergency Service of Ukraine (DSNS).

3/16/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — A dissident legal scholar who was jailed for two years in China after participating in the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement was killed Monday in his law firm’s office in New York, where he had settled after seeking asylum in the U.S., police said. Li Jinjin, 66, was stabbed to death in the city where he had long worked as an immigration lawyer, even as he continued to advocate publicly for the many people jailed or killed by Chinese authorities during the nation’s democracy movement. An arrest was made in his killing. Police said Xiaoning Zhang, 25, was taken into custody and faces a murder charge. It wasn't immediately clear when she would be arraigned or if she had retained an attorney. Chuang Chuang Chen, the CEO of the China Democracy Party, and lawyer Wei Zhu, a friend of Li’s, both told The New York Daily News that the killing might have stemmed from Li’s refusal to take Zhang on as a client. Zhang came to the U.S. in August on an F-1 student visa to go to school in Los Angeles, Chen told the Daily News. Li, who also went by the first name Jim, was often quoted in recent years by news organizations looking for insight or commentary on the Chinese dissident community or on relations between China and the West. As an immigration lawyer, he also represented some Chinese expatriates living in the U.S. who were considered fugitives by that country. Prior to his imprisonment for protesting, Li had been a legal adviser to an independent labor union that had challenged China’s government on worker rights. “I can’t believe it.

3/16/2022,"What's a tactical nuclear bomb? It is — drumroll please — a nuclear bomb. But please don't worry; they're small ones. Some are ""only"" the size of the weapons that flattened Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Some are smaller than that. Some are so small they can be launched as artillery shells. Some can be dropped by airplanes or put on the tips of short(ish)-range missiles. Some tactical nukes could even be carried on your back, though it probably wouldn't be good for you. There's been a fair amount of conversation online about the ""tactical weapons gap."" The United States has 230 of these smaller nukes, with reports that around 100 of those are in Europe. Russia has as many 2,000, most already in the European theater, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has seemed to indicate a willingness to use them, most likely if he felt himself to be losing in Ukraine, or if NATO joined the fight. So, what would this gap really mean? Would it be decisive in a war? No. ""If we were to unleash a couple of hundred versus a couple of thousand [tactical nukes] it would be a distinction without a difference,"" Retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Robert Latiff told The Week. The sheer destructive power of each side renders the details significantly irrelevant. Tit for tat, by the time the U.S. is outgunned, we're at 460 nukes launched. It's enough to destroy every tank in this war. It's certainly enough to kill millions of civilians. The Russians could keep going from there, but now we're into madness land. And having run out of the little nukes, and afraid of losing, would we really stop without resorting to one — just one — strategic bomb? If that happens, a war like we've seen before becomes a war unlike anything we've ever seen before. A tactical nuclear strike has taken us into an unwinnable strategic nuclear war. The truth is no one is sure what would happen if even one of these tactical nuclear bombs were used in war. According to Latiff, the international reaction would differ if it happened in Ukraine itself or, say, in Poland. But the only people who really know how escalation would work aren't telling. The strategy for reacting to a small nuclear provocation is top secret, Latiff said. Does that uncertainty make it more likely or less Putin would use one of these bombs? He may bank on a sub-nuclear NATO reaction. Or he may hold back because he can't bank on that. There are a lot of generals paid to think about these things.

3/16/2022,"LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - When the air-raid siren went off mid-funeral on Tuesday there was no pause from the priest and scarcely a blink from mourners, who ignored the threat of Russian missiles to bury loved ones killed by them two days before. Inside the baroque Saints Peter and Paul Garrison Church in Lviv, hundreds assembled to pay their respects to four soldiers, including one who had buried his brother only days before. All were among the 35 killed by a Russian air strike on Yavoriv military base on Sunday, in which missiles penetrated farther into Ukraine than at any time during the three-week conflict, landing just 20km from the border with Poland. Mothers hugged the coffins as weeping family members laid flowers – some blue and yellow after the Ukrainian flag - atop the polished wood. Pallbearers carried away the bodies of Oleh Yashchyshyn, Kyrylo Vyshyvanyi, Rostyslav Romanchuk and Serhiy Melnyk. Three were laid to rest at the military memorial of the city's historic Lychakiv Cemetery, the most famous cemetery in Ukraine, while a fourth went to his family's plot in a small village near Lviv. It was the second blow within a fortnight for Vyshyvanyi’s family, who buried his younger brother Vasyl on March 4. Also a soldier, he was killed near the southern city of Mykolayiv, hundreds of kilometers away. The most senior of those killed was Oleh Yashchyshyn, whose daughter was also in Yavoriv but was not seriously wounded. One child carried a teddy bear, the words 'Love, Love, Love' imprinted on a strap around her shoulder. As the priest assured their families that the quartet's loss was not in vain, the choir chanted the encomium ""Memory Eternal"" in Ukrainian.

3/16/2022,"China appears to be losing the battle to contain COVID-19, but it’s not yet ready to admit defeat. Facing the worst national outbreak since the first wave of the pandemic, authorities have introduced lockdown restrictions in cities across the country, with production lines falling idle in the tech hub of Shenzhen and offices shuttered in the financial capital Shanghai. Under President Xi Jinping, the Chinese government has stuck to a strict zero-COVID policy since the virus emerged in Wuhan in late 2019, locking down entire cities whenever cases emerge and using mass testing and strict quarantining to bring local outbreaks under control. But Chinese virologists say the arrival of the Omicron variant and its new “stealth” subvariant—both of which appear to evade China’s Sinovac vaccine—could leave that policy in tatters. For those in the Americas or Europe, the case numbers reported from China still seem pretty small: Authorities confirmed 1,337 new locally transmitted cases in mainland China on Monday. By contrast, the U.K. is currently seeing more than 200,000 cases a day, according to the main COVID tracker. But the example of Hong Kong, the former British colony that is officially semi-autonomous, is worrying. Omicron appears to be running virtually unchecked through the population of the island territory, which has registered an average of 40,000 cases a day over the past week despite widespread vaccination. Worst-hit on the mainland is the northeastern province of Jilin, bordering North Korea, where many residents are restricted to their homes except for grocery shopping trips every other day. Jilin has recorded more than 4,000 cases in the past fortnight. But multiple smaller outbreaks have also been recorded. Shenzhen, a city of 17.5 million people bordering Hong Kong, registered 66 new cases on Saturday, prompting authorities to suspend public transport, close factories—among them the huge Foxconn plant that produces the Apple iPhone. Residents have been told to stay home for the next week except when they are called for three rounds of compulsory testing. A prominent infectious-disease expert from Shanghai, Zhang Wenhong, said in an article for the Chinese business outlet Caixin that the outbreak was being driven by the Omicron BA.2 “stealth” subvariant, the most infectious lineage yet of the SARS-Cov-2 virus. The Only Way to Resolve the Wuhan ‘Lab Leak’ Controversy Zhang, whose plain-spoken appeals for people to put up with lockdown restrictions at the beginning of the pandemic made him a prominent figure, said that the case numbers suggested the beginning of an “exponential rise”—but China had no option but to try to contain the virus. “If our country opens up quickly now, it will cause a large number of infections in people in a short period of time,” Zhang wrote, according to a translation carried by the Associated Press. “No matter how low the death rate is, it will still cause a run on medical resources and a short-term shock to social life, causing irreparable harm to families and society.” Foxconn, Apple’s manufacturing partner, said it would use its “diversified production sites in China” to minimize the impact of the Shenzhen lockdown. But from a wider economic viewpoint, the lockdowns—both in Shenzhen and the industrial hub of Dongguan—could hardly have come at a worse time. Panic selling saw Chinese tech stocks listed on the Hong Kong exchange fall 11 percent on Monday—their worst single-day fall since the 2008 crash—because of wider fears that China could be dragged into the conflict in Ukraine, or that Chinese companies doing business in Russia might face Western sanctions. If China sticks with its zero-COVID policy, despite the spread of Omicron, one option is to insist that manufacturers introduce “closed management” systems, where workers live and work in a COVID-free “bubble.” The Chinese used such a system to protect last month’s Winter Olympics in Beijing, where staff and volunteers wore hazmat suits to marshal and test visiting athletes and even robots to feed them. Making that work in a megacity like Shenzhen or Shanghai would be harder. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.

3/16/2022,"If you’ve been paying attention to how Russian President Vladimir Putin talks about the war in Ukraine, you may have noticed a pattern. Putin often uses words to mean exactly the opposite of what they normally do. He labels acts of war “peacekeeping duties.” He claims to be engaging in “denazification” of Ukraine while seeking to overthrow or even kill Ukraine’s Jewish president, who is the grandson of a Holocaust survivor. He claims that Ukraine is plotting to create nuclear weapons, while the greatest current threat of nuclear war appears to be Putin himself. Putin’s brazen manipulation of language is drawing attention. Kira Rudik, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament, recently said of Putin in a CNN interview: “When he says, ‘I want peace,’ this means, ‘I’m gathering my troops to kill you.’ If he says, ‘It’s not my troops,’ he means ‘It’s my troops and I’m gathering them.’ And if he says, ‘OK, I’m retreating,’ this means ‘I’m regrouping and gathering more troops to kill you.’” As a philosophy professor who studies the British author George Orwell, I am reminded by Rudik’s comments about Putin of another set of claims: “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.” These are the words etched onto the side of the building for the government agency called the “Ministry of Truth” in Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984,” published in 1949. Orwell uses this feature of the novel to draw attention to how totalitarian regimes – like the book’s fictional state of Oceania – perversely warp language to gain and retain political power. Orwell’s keen understanding of this phenomenon was the result of having witnessed it himself. In grappling with Putin’s lies and spin, it’s helpful to look at what previous thinkers and writers, like Orwell, have said about the relationship between language and political power. Orwell, an Englishman who lived from 1903 to 1950, experienced war, imperialism and poverty during the first half of his life. These experiences led Orwell to identify as a socialist and member of the British political left. It might seem inevitable, then, that Orwell would have favorably viewed Soviet Communism, a leading force on the political left in Europe at the time. But this was not so. Instead, Orwell believed that Soviet Communism shared the same defects as Nazi Germany. Both were totalitarian states where the desire for total power and control crowded out any room for truth, individuality or freedom. Orwell did not think Soviet Communism was truly socialist, but rather that it only had a socialist façade. At age 33, Orwell served as a volunteer soldier in the Spanish Civil War. He fought with a small militia as part of a larger left-leaning coalition that was trying to stop an insurrection from Spain’s Nationalist right. This left-leaning coalition was receiving military support from the Soviet Union. But the small militia Orwell was fighting with ultimately became a target of Soviet propagandists, who leveled a range of accusations against the militia, including that its members were spies for the other side. This was a byproduct of the Soviet Union’s attempts to use its involvement in Spain as a way of gaining political power. Orwell observed how the militia he had fought with was maligned in the European press as part of this Soviet smear campaign. He explained in his book “Homage to Catalonia” that this smear campaign included telling demonstrable lies about concrete facts. This experience deeply troubled Orwell. He later reflected on this experience, writing that he was frightened by the “feeling that the very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world.” That prospect, he claimed, frightened him “much more than bombs.” Such fears influenced much of Orwell’s most influential writing, including his novel “1984” and his essay “Politics and the English Language.” In that essay, Orwell reflects on the relationship between language, thought and politics. For Orwell, language influences thought, which in turn influences politics. But politics also influences thought, which in turn influences language. Thus, Orwell – like Putin – saw how language shapes politics and vice versa. Orwell argues in the essay that if one writes well, “one can think more clearly,” and in turn that “to think clearly is a necessary first step toward political regeneration,” which I believe meant to him that a political order could recover from destructive political influences like totalitarianism. This makes good writing a political task. Orwell’s desire to avoid bad writing is not the desire to defend rigid rules of grammar. Rather, Orwell’s goal is for language users “to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way about.” Communicating clearly and precisely requires conscious thought. It takes work. But just as language can illuminate thought and regenerate politics, so too language can be used to obscure thought and degenerate politics. Putin sees this clearly and seeks to use this to his advantage. Orwell warned against the kind of abuses of language Putin commits, writing that “if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.” Orwell explored what mutual corruption of language and politics in a totalitarian regime looks like in his dystopian “1984.” In the world of “1984,” the only crime is “thoughtcrime.” The ruling class seeks to eliminate the possibility of thoughtcrime by eliminating the language needed to have the thoughts they had criminalized – which included any thought that would undermine the party’s totalitarian control. Limit language and you limit thought, or so the theory goes. Thus, the Russian Parliament passed, and Putin has signed, a law that could result in criminal charges for using the Russian word for “war” to describe the Ukraine war. Orwell also uses “1984” to explore what happens when communication conforms to the desires of political power instead of demonstrable fact.

The slogans “War is peace,” “Freedom is slavery” and “Ignorance is strength” are paradigmatic examples. This Orwellian idea has given rise to the concept of doublespeak, which occurs when one uses language to obscure meaning to manipulate others. Doublespeak is a tool in the arsenal of tyranny. It is one of Putin’s weapons of choice, as it is for many authoritarians and would-be authoritarians around the world.

3/16/2022,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea had its deadliest day yet of the pandemic on Tuesday, with 293 deaths reported in the latest 24 hours, as the country grapples with a record surge in coronavirus infections driven by the fast-moving omicron variant. The 1,196 virus patients in serious or critical conditions were also a new high. Health officials said the country’s medical response remains stable following efforts to expand resources, with more than 30% of intensive care units designated for COVID-19 treatment still available. But the strain on the hospital system is expected to increase in coming weeks, considering the time lags between infections, hospitalizations and deaths. “We anticipate the number of (serious or critical cases) to grow to around 2,000. We are preparing our medical response for that,” senior Health Ministry official Park Hyang said during a briefing. South Korea has reported a daily average of around 337,000 new cases in the past seven days, including 362,283 on Tuesday, representing more than an 80-fold increase from levels seen in mid-January, when omicron emerged as the dominant strain. The country’s caseload is now over 7.2 million, with 6.4 million added since February. Park said because of high vaccination rates, the country has so far weathered the omicron surge with lower levels of fatalities than what was seen in the United States and Europe, which was hit by the variant earlier. More than 62% of South Koreans have received booster shots. The country so far has 17.6 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people, compared to 285.5 deaths in the U.S. and 237.5 in Britain, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. The omicron variant has forced South Korea to abandon a stringent COVID-19 response based on mass laboratory tests, aggressive contact tracing and quarantines to focus limited medical resources on priority groups, including people 60 and older and those with preexisting medical conditions. The omicron surge and its growing economic toll will pose an immediate major challenge for conservative South Korean president-elect Yoon Suk Yeol, who will take office in May after narrowly winning last week’s election. Yoon has been critical of the COVID-19 response under current liberal President Moon Jae-in, which was seen as a relative success before a devastating delta-driven spread in the winter, accusing officials of maintaining an unsustainable approach that squeezed medical workers and livelihoods before being broken by omicron. Yoon has promised relaxed social distancing rules and stronger financial support for small businesses, but has yet to issue clear-cut plans to cope with the expected increase in hospitalizations and deaths. Health officials have recently significantly eased quarantine restrictions and border controls and stopped requiring adults to show proof of vaccination or negative tests when entering potentially crowded spaces like restaurants so that more public and health workers could respond to rapidly expanding at-home treatments. The country has also reshaped its testing regime to be centered around rapid antigen tests, despite concerns over their accuracy, to save laboratory tests mostly for high-risk groups. Officials may take further steps to  ease social distancing  soon after extending the curfew at restaurants, bars, movie theaters and other businesses earlier this month to ease the pandemic’s shock on service sector businesses. More than 1.6 million virus carriers with mild or moderate symptoms have been asked to isolate at home to save hospital space, the KDCA said. The country will also begin a vaccine rollout for children between the ages of 5 and 11 later this month.",World/Associated Press,South Korea reports record deaths amid omicron surge,https://news.yahoo.com/south-korea-reports-record-deaths-035638289.html

3/16/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan is set to announce on Wednesday the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions imposed on Tokyo and 17 other prefectures as a wave of infections caused by the Omicron variant continues to ebb. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is scheduled to speak at 7 p.m. (1000 GMT), when he is expected to announce the lifting of curbs on March 21, along with a further easing of border measures, local media reported. Tokyo logged 7,836 coronavirus cases on Tuesday, down 12% from a week earlier. An Omicron wave led to record infection rates in the capital and throughout Japan in February, the nation's deadliest https://www.datawrapper.de/_/yydPj wave of the pandemic so far. After a slow start, the government's COVID-19 vaccine booster programme has accelerated, with about 71% of Japan's vulnerable elderly population having received a third dose. The so-called quasi-state of emergency curbs currently applied in 18 of Japan's 47 prefectures centre on limiting hours for eateries and other businesses. Officials in the western prefecture of Osaka had considered requesting an extension of the restrictions due to high hospitalisations, but ultimately decided to let them expire, the Kyodo news service reported. The measures have had an impact on the economy, particularly the service sector. ""A certain amount of services demand will be unleashed if the curbs are lifted as households have quite a lot of savings now and it coincides with the spring holidays,"" said Daiju Aoki, chief Japan economist at UBS SuMi TRUST Wealth Management. Health experts have said the current Omicron wave is not over, and new variants could emerge at any time. But the restrictions, used repeatedly during the two-year pandemic, have lost their effectiveness on public behaviour, said Tohoku University professor Hitoshi Oshitani. ""We need to have a different strategy to suppress the transmission at this stage,"" said Oshitani, a lead advisor on the government's pandemic response. ""It's still premature to discuss a kind of exit strategy from this virus."" Kishida is also likely to announce a raising of the limit on daily arrivals in Japan to 10,000 from April, from the current 7,000, media have said, the latest step in relaxing tough border regulations that have drawn criticism from businesses and educators.

3/16/2022,"Mikhaela Jennings is a Black TikToker who created the viral ""girls that get it, get it"" sound. Jennings has repeatedly called out creators and brands using it without crediting her. She is now reportedly considering trademarking her sounds. A Black TikToker has spoken out against creators and brands who have used her viral sound without crediting her, calling them ""disrespectful."" Mikhaela Jennings, who goes by @KhaeNotBae on TikTok, has 460,000 followers and is known for posting short comedic videos sharing her opinion about TV shows and trends. In November 2021, she posted a TikTok in response to people who criticized her new hairstyle, and used the phrase, ""The girls that get it, get it; the girls who don't, don't."" The sound has since been reused in 71,000 videos as part of a TikTok trend where women share divisive beauty and fashion choices. Variations of the phrase have been used by brands including Boohoo, LinkedIn, Outback Steakhouse, and Oreo. Jennings told Refinery 29's Katherine Singh that she's asked some brands which have used her phrase to compensate her, but they have been reluctant to do so. Some creators re-recorded the phrase using their own voices, and their videos received more views than Jenning's original clip, which has 3.3 million views. Many of these TikToks did not credit Jennings as the creator of the trend in the video description or comments section. In an interview posted by Complex on Twitter in February, Jennings said seeing non-Black creators use her sound was ""eerie"" because she didn't expect the sound to circulate beyond the Black community, which her content is geared towards. She said she feels people expect her to be grateful that her sound is used, but she thinks it's ""very disrespectful."" Jennings, who also coined the phrase, ""I know you girls like to tussle,"" which became a viral sound in October 2021, told Refinery29 she plans to continue to make TikTok content ""for as long as it's giving back to me,"" adding, ""as soon as it starts taking more than it's giving, it's done for."" The outlet also reported that she is now looking into trademarking her sounds. It is not always customary to credit TikTok sounds, as users can click on a link to the sound at the bottom of the TikTok, where the original clip can typically be found. However, some Black creators who invented dance trends on TikTok previously told Insider that being credited in the description by other creators can open up ""life-changing"" opportunities. In March 2021, TikTok stars Addison Rae and Charli D'Amelio faced criticism for demonstrating TikTok dances without acknowledging the original Black creators. Some Black creators refused to make any new dances for a month to highlight how their work has been co-opted by white creators.

3/16/2022,"American intelligence officials have discovered that the barrage of ballistic missiles Russia has fired into Ukraine contain a surprise: decoys that trick air-defense radars and fool heat-seeking missiles. The devices are each about 1 foot long, shaped like a dart and white with an orange tail, according to an American intelligence official. They are released by the Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles that Russia is firing from mobile launchers across the border, the official said, when the missile senses that it has been targeted by air defense systems. Each is packed with electronics and produces radio signals to jam or spoof enemy radars attempting to locate the Iskander-M, and contains a heat source to attract incoming missiles. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about intelligence matters, described the devices on the condition of anonymity. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times The use of the decoys may help explain why Ukrainian air-defense weapons have had difficulty intercepting Russia’s Iskander missiles. Powered by a solid-fuel rocket motor, the Iskander can reach targets more than 200 miles away, according to U.S. government documents. Each mobile launcher can fire two Iskanders before it must be reloaded. Photographs of the dart-shaped munitions began circulating on social media two weeks ago. They had stumped experts and open-source intelligence analysts — many of whom mistook them for bomblets from cluster weapons based on their size and shape. Richard Stevens, who spent 22 years in the British Army as an explosive ordnance disposal soldier and later worked as a civilian bomb technician for 10 years in southern Iraq, Africa and other regions, said he had been exposed “to plenty of Chinese and Russian munitions, but I had never seen this.” Stevens posted photos of the munitions to a site for military and civilian bomb disposal experts that he started in 2011, and found that no one else seemed to have seen these mystery munitions before either. “That Russia is using that size of weapon — the Iskander-M — and quite a few of them I believe, that’s why we’re seeing this now,” Stevens said. “It’s just that, post-conflict in the past 10 to 15 years, no one has had the opportunity to see this.” The devices are similar to Cold War decoys called “penetration aids,” the intelligence official said, that have accompanied nuclear warheads since the 1970s and were designed to evade anti-missile systems and allow individual warheads to reach their targets. The incorporation of the devices into weapons such as the Iskander-M that have conventional warheads has not been previously documented in military arsenals. “The minute people came up with missiles, people started trying to shoot them down, and the minute people started trying to shoot them down, people started thinking about penetration aids,” said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor of nonproliferation at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California. “But we never see them because they’re highly secret — if you know how they work, you can counteract them.” The use of the decoys may point to some level of carelessness or urgency by Russian military leadership, Lewis said, given that Russia knows they will inevitably be collected and studied by Western intelligence services so that NATO air defenses can be programmed to defeat the Iskander’s countermeasures. And it is highly unlikely, he said, that the version of the Iskander that Russia has sold to other countries would contain these decoys. “That suggests to me that the Russians place some value on keeping that technology close to home and that this war is important enough to them to give that up,” Lewis said. “They’re digging deep, and maybe they no longer care, but I would care if I were them. “I think that there are some very excited people in the U.S. intelligence community right now.” © 2022 The New York Times Company",World/The New York Times,Russia Deploys a Mystery Munition in Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-deploys-mystery-munition-ukraine-114716254.html
3/16/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The number of women who died by suicide in Japan rose for a second straight year in 2021 although the overall number of people who took their own lives in the country edged down, police said on Tuesday. Suicide has a long history in Japan as a way of avoiding shame or dishonour, and its suicide rate had long topped the Group of Seven nations, but a concerted national effort brought numbers down by roughly 40 percent over 15 years - although they rose in 2020 due to stresses brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, the Health Ministry said. While the overall number of suicides edged down by 74 to 21,007 from the year before, the number of women who took their own lives rose by 42 to 7,068, the second straight year of increase, according to data from the National Police Agency. By contrast, the number of men who died by suicide decreased by 116 to 13,939. No explanations for the difference were immediately available, but officials have previously said the coronavirus pandemic placed extra stresses on women due to a number of reasons, including job losses in the service and retail sectors where women tend to work. The number of suicides peaked at 34,427 in 2003, alarming policymakers who drew up a comprehensive prevention programme launched in 2007.

3/16/2022,"Ukrainian soldiers shouted ""God save the Queen!"" when using UK-made weapons, The Sunday Times said. As of March 9, the UK had sent Ukraine 3,615 NLAW anti-tank missiles, the UK defense secretary said. The Sunday Times said Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the weapons in calls with Boris Johnson. Ukrainian soldiers shouted ""God save the Queen!"" when they fired weaponry given to the country by the UK, The Sunday Times of London reported, citing an anecdote that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told. About 1,200 people have died in the port city of Mariupol, Ukraine, after intense shelling by Russia. Now, locals are burying the dead in a mass grave. It's one of several lighthearted details described in the paper's report on the calls between Zelenskyy and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in which they discussed the UK sending weapons to Ukraine to defend against Russia. As of March 9 the UK had sent 3,615 anti-tank weapons known as NLAWs — next-generation light anti-tank weapons — to assist Ukraine, Sky News reported, citing UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace. Journalists from MailOnline — a British publication — were also greeted with ""God save the Queen!"" during a reporting trip to a base where Ukrainian soldiers were being trained to use NLAWs, the MailOnline reported. The Sunday Times reported that in a recent call, Zelenskyy serenaded the UK prime minister with two songs adapted to play on the similar sound of NLAW and ""in love"" when pronounced in Ukrainian, which sometimes voices a W sound as a V. They were ""All You Need Is N-Love,"" based on The Beatles' ""All You Need Is Love,"" and ""When You're Young and in Love"" by The Marvelettes, the paper said. NLAWs are shoulder-mounted weapons capable of firing a single 150 mm high-explosive anti-tank missile up to 2,600 feet. They are built in Belfast, Northern Ireland, by the French company Thales, and they have been highly praised in Ukraine's defense. They've enabled many of the tank ambushes that have slowed Russia's invasion.

3/16/2022,"Michael Flynn, Donald Trump’s disgraced former national security advisor, wants you to know he’s the “last guy” who would be an apologist for Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader currently conducting a murderous attack on Ukraine. Flynn would also like you to know, however, that Putin’s invasion “has now upset” plans for a “New World Order” organized by people like billionaire Bill Gates, who are (somehow) pushing to eliminate “God and a soul.” More from Rolling Stone 'We Would Die Under Moscow.' Odesa Unites To Resist Putin's Invasion Russian Journalist in Court After Protesting Ukraine Invasion During State TV Broadcast Meet the Ukrainian Mothers Who Won't Leave While Their Sons Are at War That is a conspiracy theory word salad from Flynn, but it goes toward a dangerous end: setting up Putin as a hero to a host of conspiracy theorists and covering for an invasion that has caused mass death and suffering in Ukraine. “Someone like Vladimir Putin has upset this balance of the New World Order they were trying to achieve by going into Ukraine. And you know, I’m probably the last person that’s going to be a Putin apologist. I won’t be, but what I do understand are the dynamics that are playing out in Ukraine right now,” Flynn said on March 8 during an appearance on Thrivetime Show, a podcast hosted by anti-vaxx commentator Clay Clark. Together, Flynn and Clark have organized the Reawaken America tour, a far-right event traveling to cities across the U.S. featuring conspiracy-pushing speakers such as Eric Trump, Roger Stone, and MyPillow Guy Mike Lindell. Flynn continued his rant on Clark’s podcast by claiming that the World Economic Forum and billionaires like Gates are angry with Putin for invading Ukraine and ruining their plans for world domination. “All of what we are seeing play out in Europe right now is an upsetting of the balance of the world order as they want it—as people like [Israeli professor and historian] Dr. [Yuval Noah] Harari, as people like Klaus Schwab [founder of the World Economic Forum] and others,” Flynn said. “Bill Gates is another one.” These individuals, Flynn claimed, “are very smart, they’re very well resourced, and they have a very sort of strategic idea of how they want to see the world develop.” He added, “God and a soul are not part of that strategy.” According to the Anti-Defamation League, Schwab and others have been accused by conspiracy theorists of trying to use the Covid-19 pandemic as an opportunity to “reorganize global societies and economies to their benefit” while implementing a “global totalitarian regime” led by the rich and powerful. The conspiracy theory, known as “The Great Reset,” stems from a report by the same name issued by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in June 2020. According to WEF, “’The Great Reset’ is a commitment to jointly and urgently build the foundations of our economic and social system for a more fair, sustainable and resilient future.” But conspiracy theorists see “The Great Reset” as a threat to people everywhere as the global elite concentrate their power and control. Flynn’s attempt to link Ukraine back to his pet conspiracies muddies the waters, painting Putin as a resistor of global elites, rather than a cruel autocrat invading a sovereign nation to secure his legacy, no matter how many people die as a result.

3/16/2022,"By Tim Kelly TOKYO (Reuters) - In a sign of deepening military cooperation between Japan and the United States, amphibious Japanese troops and U.S. Marines on Tuesday practised airborne landing assaults together for the first time. Japan is revising a decade-old national security strategy this year in the face of China's growing military assertiveness. The upgrade to defence policy guidelines is expected to call for the country to take a more active role alongside Washington in regional security. The drills in the foothills of Mount Fuji on Tuesday involved 400 troops from Japan's Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade (ARDB), and 600 U.S. marines, and is part of a three-week joint exercise to hone interoperability between the allies. Tilt-rotor Osprey troop carriers were used during the drills. ""The real significance from this training is that the Marines and the ARDB are doing serious combat training of a sort that would have been unthinkable a decade ago,"" said Grant Newsham, a retired U.S. Marine Corps colonel who advised Japan as a liaison officer when it set up its amphibious force. ""It demonstrates a more solidly linked U.S. and Japan."" Activated in 2018, the ARDB troops are Japan's first marines since World War Two and were formed to reinforce its defence along its southwest islands at the edge of the East China Sea. Trained to take back captured islands using helicopters, Ospreys and amphibious landing craft, the force of around 1,500 soldiers would likely be one of the first in action to counter any Chinese attack on Japan's islands. China, which is locked in a territorial dispute with Japan over uninhabited islands controlled by Tokyo in the East China Sea, routinely dispatches ships to assert its claims. The joint drills also come as Russia's invasion of Ukraine raises fresh security concerns in East Asia where China is putting pressure on Taiwan following its crackdown on Hong Kong. Japan also faces Russia's forces operating from Far East bases that are increasingly cooperating with China's military. Moscow describes its military action in Ukraine as a ""special operation"".
