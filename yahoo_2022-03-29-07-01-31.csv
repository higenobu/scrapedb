3/29/2022,"Tesla (TSLA) shares are rallying after the company disclosed plans for a stock split on Monday. But one strategist isn’t convinced the fanfare will last very long among investors. The move threatens to further inflate what some stock-watchers believe is a market bubble in the making for Tesla when the stock split dramatically reduces its share price and “unsuspecting” retail investors inevitably pour in, David Trainer, CEO of the investment firm New Construct, argued in reaction to the news. Moreover, Tesla’s plans to pursue a stock split (which if approved, would mark the second time in nearly two years) does not change the fact that shares are trading at a valuation “completely disconnected from fundamentals,” Trainer said. The electric-vehicle giant revealed in a tweet Monday — and later confirmed by filing plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) — that Tesla would request shareholder approval at its annual meeting to split the company’s stock so it can pay a special dividend to investors. Tesla’s announcement sent shares soaring as much as 8% in intraday trading Monday. The stock was up 6.3% as of 12:17 p.m. ET to trade at about $1,074.48 per share. According to Trainer, the resulting reduced price on Tesla from the split could drive investors looking to capitalize on the opportunity to buy and fuel what he perceives as a bubble, when shares of a stock skyrocket in price but is out of proportion to the company’s fundamental value. The plan to seek shareholder approval on a stock split comes as Tesla faces increasing competition from legacy automakers rushing into the electric vehicle market. Trainer also said that Tesla must sell well over 16 million cars per year in order to justify its current stock price of over $1,000 per share, while it only sold about 1 million cars in 2021 and is nowhere near producing enough cars to justify that price level. A recent shutdown of its Shanghai factory for four days as the city prepares for a COVID-related lock down may also impact production as the company already grapples with a series of headwinds from supply chain snafus. A one-week shutdown and subsequent weeklong restart on production could see the factory lose around 17,300 units of production based on the Giga Shanghai’s theoretical output of 450,000 vehicles a year. “We advise investors to sell the rally in Tesla shares, as the stock faces no fundamental upside catalysts,” he said, adding that nearly every major automaker has a significant electric vehicle production strategy in the works to compete with the electric-car pioneer. “Tesla's first mover advantage in the electric vehicle space is fading fast.” Tesla announced its first stock split, a 5-for-1 offering, in August 2020. Shares were trading around the $1,300 level at the time of the previous stock split announcement and pushed to $2,000 following the news to bring the market cap above $400 billion The type of stock split Tesla will propose to shareholders at its next annual meeting, likely to be held in June, remains unclear. — Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

3/29/2022,"Step aside Apple and Google, Nvidia may be the new king of tech, one analyst contends. ""Nvidia may be the most important technology company today,"" said Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse in a new note on Monday. The analyst reiterated an Outperform rating on Nvidia with a $375 price target. Shares of Nvidia rose slightly in afternoon trading Monday to $277. Muse's upbeat take on Nvidia comes hot on the heels of the company's closely watched GTC conference, where it held nearly 1,000 sessions that included more than 1,600 speakers. ""Beyond having best-in class hardware accelerator solutions with its GPUs, Nvidia is broadening its portfolio and deepening its expertise across DPUs and CPUs, along with other areas such as connectivity and interconnects to put all of the pieces together. Then to ensure these complex solutions run seamlessly, Nvidia is continuing to pioneer software both at the foundational level and application specific level — which is key to the company’s TAM [total addressable market] expansion and the overall democratization of AI. Events like GTC hammer these point home, with various customers and ecosystem partners highlighting the advancements they are driving along with NVDA, and clear roadmaps for continued growth for the next decade plus,"" Muse explained. One area Nvidia is doubling down on is its autonomous driving platform. At Nvidia's conference last week, CEO Jensen Huang touted the company’s $11 billion vehicle-tech order pipeline over the next six years. “Automotive will surely be our next multibillion-dollar business,” Huang told Julie Hyman and Dan Howley in a Yahoo Finance Presents interview. “The $11 billion is going to be quite a significant business for us just in the car. But if you look at the totality of AV, I think this is going to be one of the largest AI industries in the world.” During the conference, Nvidia put the potential market for auto-related software, hardware and data-center services at $300 billion. Points out Evercore ISI's Muse, ""Advancements across in vehicle technologies, data center capabilities, connectivity, and AI/simulation (Omniverse) are enabling a transformation in the automotive industry today, leading to an estimated $2 trillion opportunity from the monetization of car services over the coming decade (largely led by Autonomous Driving and/or Mobility-as-a-Service).""

3/29/2022,"For a second time in less than two years, Tesla (TSLA) is seeking to split its stock - and shares are jumping. In a tweet earlier Monday, Tesla confirmed it was asking shareholders for permission to split the stock: Essentially shareholders would receive a special dividend of additional shares per share that they already own. In August 2020, when Tesla announced its first stock split, it was a 5 for 1 offering. It is unclear yet what type of split would be proposed for shareholders at this time. Tesla’s annual meeting is usually in June. At the time of Tesla’s previous stock split announcement, shares were trading around the $1,300 level. Once the stock split was announced, shares were pushing to $2,000, giving the company a market cap of over $400 billion. Since then Tesla shares have been on a rocket ship higher, soaring to over $1,000 post-split and with the company yet again reclaiming its $1 trillion market cap after an early 2022 hiccup. Analyst Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities has given his blessing for the new split proposal. “We view Tesla's move following the likes of Amazon, Google, Apple and initiating its second stock split in two years as a smart strategic move that will be a positive catalyst for shares going forward,” he wrote. Theoretically speaking a stock split should not move shares higher pre-split because the value of the company hasn’t changed. But various theories abound for why a split could boost values of the stock. For one, if the shares are cheaper, more retail investors are able to buy and own shares of the stock, increasing the base of ownership. Another theory is that when a stock splits, such as for a popular company like Tesla, it is more easily added to various indexes like the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100, which then will lead to more shares being purchased by fund managers that model their portfolios against these indexes. Another theory is cheaper share prices allow for cheaper options pricing for the booming derivatives market, where retail traders and the Wall Street Bets community actively operate. However, all is not well for Tesla, as ongoing COVID-19 flare-up in Shanghai have reportedly led to another factory shutdown of Tesla’s Gigafactory there. Bloomberg is reporting Tesla is shutting production at its Shanghai factory for four days as the city is preparing to lock down in two stages to carry out mass testing for COVID 19, citing sources. The report goes on to say that Giga Shanghai is located in the part of the city which is part of stage 1 of the lockdown process, meaning it will be shut down from now until Friday. The first shutdown that affected the Shanghai factory lasted two days. It is unclear how much production will be impacted and how soon Tesla can ramp up production once the factory is given an all-clear. Assuming a one-week shutdown, with a week to restart production and get assembly lines back up to speed, it’s possible the factory may lose around 17,300 units of production, given Giga Shanghai’s theoretical output of 450K vehicles a year. This assumes the factory was running at full capacity at this time. Nevertheless, the news of another stock split is overshadowing the Shanghai shutdown, with Tesla shares up 5% in early trading. —— Pras Subramanian is the senior autos reporter for Yahoo Finance.

3/29/2022,"By Muyu Xu and Chen Aizhu BEIJING (Reuters) -China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, better known as Sinopec, is planning its highest capital investment in history for 2022 after recording its best profit in a decade, echoing Beijing's call for energy companies to raise production. Sinopec expects to spend 198 billion yuan ($31.10 billion) in 2022, up 18% from a year ago, beating the previous record of 181.7 billion yuan set in 2013, according to a company statement filed to the Shanghai Stocks Exchange on Sunday. It plans to invest 81.5 billion yuan in upstream exploitation, especially the crude oil bases in Shunbei and Tahe fields, and natural gas fields in Sichuan province and the Inner Mongolia region. ""Looking ahead in 2022, the market demand for refined oil will continued to recover, and demand for natural gas and petrochemical products will keep growing,"" Sinopec said in the statement. It also warned of potential impacts of geopolitical challenges and volatile oil prices on the investment and operation at overseas businesses. But the firm did not name any specific project. Reuters reported that Sinopec Group had suspended talks for a major petrochemical investment and a gas marketing venture in Russia, heeding a government call for caution as sanctions mount over the invasion of Ukraine. Brent oil prices have gained 52% so far this year and hit as high as $139 a barrel in early March, stoked by fears of supply disruption in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Sinopec recorded its biggest profit in a decade in 2021 on the back of recovering energy demand and oil price increases in the post-COVID era, with net earnings reaching 71.21 billion yuan. It plans to produce 281.2 million barrels of crude oil and 12,567 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2022, up from its output of 279.76 million barrels and 1,199 billion cubic feet in 2021. Beijing seeks to ensure energy safety in the country amid intensifying geopolitical risks. It wants to keep annual crude oil output at 200 million tonnes and crank up natural gas production to more than 230 billion cubic metres (bcm) by 2025 from 205 bcm in 2021. Crude throughput and production of refined oil products at Sinopec are expected to stay around the same level in 2022 from a year ago, at 258 million tonnes and 147 million tonnes, respectively. But demand for gasoline and diesel are dented in China as more than 2,000 of daily COVID cases have triggered local authorities to impose stringent travel restrictions while manufacturers suspended operations amid supply chain clogs.

3/29/2022,"Since a Wyckoff accumulation pattern in the smaller timeframe is about to complete, gold could be ready for a short-term uptrend to test the previous high near 2080 despite a Wyckoff change of character (as discussed in my video) showing up in Gold futures (GC) two weeks ago, which stopped the uptrend since early of February 2022. As shown in the 4-hour chart of gold, a selling climax (SC) was achieved followed by an automatic rally (AR), which defined the upper and lower boundary for gold. The recent sign of strength (SOS) rally broke above the resistance at 1950 is the best rally within the short duration of the trading range since the selling climax while the backup action is the shallowest reaction. These clues suggest gold is at a sweet spot to enter the mark-up phase upon confirmation. A commitment above the immediate resistance at 1970 in gold could kick start the rally to test the upper resistance at 2020 followed by 2080. Despite the bullish characteristics as explained above, a failure case of this short-term Wyckoff accumulation structure is to be considered as it might take more time to develop the structure before entering the markup phase. Should gold break below 1940, the markup scenario is violated and gold is likely to test the low near 1900 while spending more time within the trading range. The price target for gold can be estimated and projected using Point & Figure (P&F) chart as shown below: The minimum price target for gold is estimated to be 2080 using the full segment calculation (as highlighted in blue), which coincides with the resistance formed by the previous swing high level. Detail analysis using Wyckoff method as shown in the video is to be conducted to anticipate the next move in gold as we will need to analyze how the price interacts with the key resistance level, its characteristics and to interpret the supply and demand as reflected in the volume. The strong rally in the market especially the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq 100 (NDX) in the past two weeks draws the attention of both traders and investors. Bullish sentiment is definitely back, which is also reflected in my stock screener below: While going through the bullish trade entry setup for the stocks, many commodities related stocks range from oil and gas, agricultural milling, fertilizers, precious metals, etc… show outperformance. These are the trade entry setups I will be focusing on in order to beat the market. Yet majority of the news headlines focus on the deeply oversold technology stocks. These oversold technology stocks might have gained a lot in the past two weeks. Yet, it still does not change the bearish structures for most of the them. Some of them at best could be at their base building structures while bottoming out. A lot of them are likely to resume their downtrend once the market reverses to test the low formed in February 2022. Focus on the stocks that show outperformance will likely lead to extraordinary return in the long run. Visit TradePrecise.com to get more market insights in email for free.

3/29/2022,"(Adds more detail, context, recasts headline) By Nina Chestney March 28 (Reuters) - Russia is working out methods for accepting payments for its gas exports in roubles and it will take decisions in due course should European countries refuse to pay in the Russian currency, the Kremlin said on Monday. At a meeting of European Union leaders on Friday, no common position emerged on Russia's demand last week that ""unfriendly"" countries must pay in roubles, not euros, for its gas in the wake of the United States and European allies teaming up on a series of sanctions aimed at Russia. Concerns over security of supply were enhanced after the demand, with companies and EU nations scrambling to understand the ramifications. The Russian central bank, the government and Gazprom , which accounts for 40% of European gas imports, should present their proposals for rouble gas payments to President Vladimir Putin by March 31. ""We are not going to supply gas for free, this is clear,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call. ""In our situation, this is hardly possible and appropriate to engage in charity (with European customers)."" On Friday, German Finance Minister Christian Lindner advised German energy providers not to pay for Russian gas in roubles, in an interview with broadcaster Welt. Italy will continue paying Russia for energy in euros, a top economic adviser to the Italian government said last week. ""The only big issue in Europe is gas and Russia is asking us to pay in roubles which we don't have and it's not in the contract,"" the chief executive of Italian energy group Eni , Claudio Descalzi, said on Monday at an industry event in the United Arab Emirates. Poland's PGNiG, which has a contract with Gazprom until the end of the year, has also said it cannot simply switch to paying in roubles. The EU aims to cut its dependency on Russian gas by two-thirds this year and end Russian fossil fuel imports by 2027. On Friday, the United States said it will work to supply 15 billion cubic metres of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the European Union this year. U.S. LNG plants are producing at full capacity and analysts say most of any additional U.S. gas sent to Europe would have to come from exports that would have gone elsewhere. Russian gas exports to the EU were at around 155 bcm last year.

3/29/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Barclays Plc expects to take a 450 million-pound ($591 million) hit and will delay a share buyback after mistakenly issuing about $15 billion more structured notes and exchange traded notes than it had registered for sale. Most Read from Bloomberg Low-Priced Omega Speedmaster Prompts Global Swatch Store Chaos Ukraine Update: Negotiators Set for Face-to-Face Talks This Week Will Smith Smacks Chris Rock, Wins Oscar in Wild Academy Awards Vanguard Stumbles In Pivot From Cult of Jack Bogle Biden Seeks to Temper Remark on Putin as U.S. Allies Object The firm issued about $36 billion of investment products after registering with U.S. regulators in August 2019 to sell up to $20.8 billion, according to a statement Monday. The error will require the firm to repurchase affected securities -- a so-called rescission offer -- at their original price. The error was called “basic”, “bizarre” and “embarrassing” by analysts, and Barclays said it was investigating the cause and responding to inquires from regulators. Among those asking questions are officials in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement division, according to a person familiar with the matter. Major banks typically file for blanket registrations that allow them to regularly issue notes that give clients a chance to bet on everything from market volatility to the performance of Tesla Inc. shares. Market observers couldn’t recall a bank’s issuance exceeding the amount it registered, let alone blowing billions past its limit. “This kind of seemingly basic error may shake confidence in the investment bank going forward,” said Fahed Kunwar, an analyst at Redburn. “With a new management team in place, there are already questions on the ability of the investment bank to continue to its strong performance.” Shares in Barclays were down 2.8% as of 11:37 a.m. in London on Monday. Shelf Registration Barclays Bank Plc, the subsidiary that holds the lender’s corporate and investment bank, has determined that “securities offered and sold under its U.S. shelf registration statement during a period of approximately one year exceeded the registered amount,” the lender said in the statement. A shelf registration is an agreement with regulators to allow finance firms to issue securities without applying for approval each time. It allows for a series of issuances without requiring further prospectuses to be filed. Monday’s announcement helps explain the bank’s recent halt of sales and issuance for a pair of major exchange-traded notes in the U.S. On March 14, Barclays said it no longer had capacity to support issuance of the iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN and the iPath Pure Beta Crude Oil ETN. As a result both products have struggled to price near the value of their underlying assets. Chief Executive Officer C.S. Venkatakrishnan, who took charge of the lender last November, was the group’s chief risk officer at the time the registration document was filed. Rescission Losses Barclays said in Monday’s statement that its “best estimate at this time” of the rescission losses suggests a charge of about 450 million pounds. The lender’s 1-billion-pound share buyback, originally expected to start in the first three months of the year, is now expected in the second quarter. The unexpected hit might weigh on first-quarter results, analysts at Citigroup Inc. said. “An unhelpful matter, which has triggered an independent review around the control environment,” said Jefferies analyst Joseph Dickerson. “Regulatory inquiries may weigh on sentiment.” Barclays Bank Plc will file a new automatic shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission as soon as practicable. The bank said it remains committed to its structured products business in the U.S. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says: Barclays’ errors in issuing structured notes and exchange-traded notes in excess of registered amounts is more a blow to reputation than financials, with half of a near-$600 million hit expected to reverse (hedging) on conclusion of the rescission offer. The deferral of the 1 billion-pound buyback to 2Q from 1Q is disappointing, though again more a sentiment issue than anything fundamental. -- Jonathan Tyce, BI banking analyst (Updates with SEC inquiry in third paragraph.)

3/29/2022,"After the bell rings on Tuesday (March 29), Micron (MU) will step up to deliver its latest quarterly report. Mirroring the broader markets’ volatile start to the year, the stock has had a rough ride in 2022, having shaved 15% off its valuation so far. However, a stock’s poor performance does not necessarily correlate with a company’s fortunes, and heading into the print, Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann expects the computer memory giant to bring its A-game again. “We see the February quarter (F2Q) being driven by strength across the board, including in data center, mobile, PC, and auto, as well as better than expected bit shipment and pricing trends for both DRAM and NAND,” the 5-star analyst opined. For the quarter, Mosesmann expects revenue and adj. EPS to both come in above the consensus estimate of $7.52 billion and $1.97, respectively. Looking ahead to the May quarter (F3Q), the analyst also anticipates Micron will guide above the Street’s forecast of revenue growth around high single-digits sequentially and adj. EPS of $2.27. The analyst counts “continued global DRAM tightness, a stronger than expected NAND environment, and overall ASP tailwinds,” as reasons to be confident. Both for DRAM and NAND, Mosesmann thinks the company saw “better than expected pricing.” DRAM shipments getting hit by the ongoing non-memory component shortages is the “wildcard” to keep an eye on. On the whole, Mosesmann believes supply shortages will remain an issue throughout the year. This, coupled with demand from cloud and smartphone customers, bodes well for the company in CY2022. In fact, given the current supply/demand dynamics for DRAM and NAND, Mosesmann expects Micron to deliver “record revenues and solid profitability in FY2022.” To this end, Mosesmann rates MU shares a Buy, backed by a $165 price target. This suggests room for outsized share appreciation of 107% in the year ahead. (To watch Mosesmann’s track record, click here) Overall, there are 13 analyst reviews on record for MU, and all of them are positive, naturally culminating in a Strong Buy consensus rating. While the $119.33 average price target is not quite as bullish as Mosesmann’s objective, the figure still implies robust gains of 53% over the one-year timeframe.

3/29/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Wells Fargo & Co. will start letting customers earn points and miles on their rent payments as the banking giant deepens its push into credit cards.

Bilt was created last year and already works with some of the country’s largest property owners and managers, including AvalonBay Communities Inc., Blackstone Inc. and Cushman & Wakefield Plc. Rather than drawing down from a customer’s credit line, rent payments using the card will come from a linked bank account. Banks and payment networks have long sought to move the $500 billion Americans spend on rent each year to cards and other forms of electronic payments. Property managers tend to offer tenants three ways to pay: via check, using an electronic bank transfer or with a credit card. Nearly half the time, payments are made using a check or other paper methods, according to the Federal Reserve, and renters using credit cards are often charged as much as 3% to cover processing costs. “It didn’t take long for us to really see the opportunity here,” said Dan Dougherty, executive vice president of co-brand partnerships at Wells Fargo. “You have rent, which is $500 billion every year -- not only do you not get rewards, if you want to use a card you’re going to have fees on that. So let’s solve that.” Card users will be able to earn one point per dollar spent on rent and a bevy of perks for other purchases, according to the statement. For renters whose landlords don’t accept credit cards or other forms of digital payments, Bilt will send a check on behalf of customers. Points can be redeemed with partners including airlines and hotel chains. Users can also put points toward a down payment when buying a home with a Fannie Mae or Federal Housing Administration mortgage. “We were looking at this saying, ‘How is it possible your single largest expense -- rent -- is the only expense where you don’t earn anything back?’” said Bilt Chief Executive Officer Ankur Jain, whose alliance with multifamily owners and managers represents more than 2 million apartment units. “Now, you’re getting something back for it.” For Wells Fargo, the tie-up marks another step toward beefing up its presence in card lending. While the bank is usually ranked No. 2 in debit cards, it’s long punched under its weight in credit cards, typically coming in at No. 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. To try to change that, the lender has unveiled a number of new cards. The firm debuted a co-brand credit card with Hotels.com in 2020, and last year introduced a cash-back card. Wells Fargo plans to pitch customers on the Bilt card through its branches and ATMs, Dougherty said. The Bilt product is the first time Wells Fargo and Mastercard have partnered on a new credit card in five years. As part of the offering, the Purchase, New York-based payment network created BiltProtect, which is what the company will use to pull funds for rent payments directly from a linked bank account. “We could not be more excited about our partnership,” said Bunita Sawhney, executive vice president of U.S. financial institutions at Mastercard. “We’re really keen to get this one off the ground.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Silicon Valley’s Wealthiest Russian Is Carefully—Very Carefully—Distancing Himself From Putin Hong Kong’s Completely Avoidable Covid Catastrophe An iPhone Subscription Would Boost Apple’s Profit Germany Doubles Military Spending, But Can’t Rearm Overnight A Reliable Recession Indicator May Be Sending a False Alarm ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•13 hours ago,New Wells Fargo Credit Card Gives Customers Rewards for Rent Payments,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-credit-card-gives-090000057.html
