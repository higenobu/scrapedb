3/28/2022,"In the week ending 24th March, mortgage rates rose sharply for a second consecutive week. 30-year fixed rates jumped by 26 basis points to 4.42%. In the week prior, 30-year fixed rates surged by 31 basis points. 30-year fixed rates were at their highest since 4.35% on February-27, 2019. Year-on-year, 30-year fixed rates were up by 125 basis points. 30-year fixed rates were still down by 52 basis points since November 2018’s last peak of 4.94%. It was a quiet first half of the week, with no major stats to provide U.S Treasuries and mortgage rates with direction. Rising crude oil prices and concerns over further supply chain disruption kept inflation in focus. On the monetary policy front, hawkish Fed Chair chatter supported the upward trend in mortgage rates. Fed Chair Powell talked of a willingness to lift rates more aggressively to curb inflation. The weekly average rates for new mortgages, as of 24th March, were quoted by Freddie Mac to be: 30-year fixed rates surged by 26 basis points to 4.42% in the week. This time last year, rates had stood at 4.17%. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.8 points. 15-year fixed rates jumped by 24 basis points to 3.63% in the week. Rates were up by 118 basis points from 2.45% a year ago. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.8 points. 5-year fixed rates rose by 17 basis points to 3.36%. Rates were up by 52 basis points from 2.84% a year ago. The average fee rose from 0.2 points to 0.3 points. According to Freddie Mac, Rising inflation, escalating geopolitical uncertainty, and the Fed drove rates higher, reducing consumer purchasing power. The jump in mortgage rates, coupled with house price appreciation, is increasing monthly mortgage payments and affecting homebuyers’ ability to keep up with the market. For the week ending 18th March, the rates were: Average interest rates for 30-year fixed with conforming loan balances rose from 4.27% to 4.50%. Points increased from 0.54 to 0.59 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates backed by FHA increased from 4.23% to 4.40%. Points rose from 0.62 to 0.73 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year rates for jumbo loan balances increased from 4.02% to 4.11%. Points rose from 0.37 to 0.51 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Weekly figures released by the Mortgage Bankers Association showed that the Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, slid by 8.1% in the week ending March-18. The Index fell by 1.2% in the previous week. The Refinance Index tumbled by 14% and was 54% lower than the same week a year ago. In the week prior, the Index fell by 3%. The refinance share of mortgage activity declined from 48.4% to 44.8%. In the previous week, the share decreased from 49.5% to 48.4%. According to the MBA, 30-year conforming mortgage rates saw the largest weekly increase since March 2020. The upside came in response to markets pricing in faster rate hikes and expectations of fewer MBS purchases from the FED. Refinance volume has dropped, with mortgage rates now at 4.5%. The MBA now forecasts mortgage rates to trend higher through the course of 2022. Purchase application volume fell modestly, while first time buyers are increasingly challenged by rising house prices and higher mortgage rates. Early in the week, consumer confidence and ADP nonfarm payroll figures will draw interest. While the stats will draw attention, crude oil prices, geopolitics, and FOMC member chatter will remain key drivers. A further uptrend in crude oil prices would push consumer prices even higher, which would force the FED into a more aggressive interest rate path.

3/28/2022,"A warning sign for the world’s biggest economy is flashing on the dashboard of bond markets. Part of the Treasury yield curve has inverted, a strong signal that nervy investors are bracing for a US recession. Yields on short-term government debt are surging in a global bond rout as expectations rise of central banks responding to decades-high inflation with interest rate increases. Long-dated debt, such as 10-year and 30-year government bonds, usually have higher yields than short-term debt such as two and five-year bonds, as investors are compensated for keeping their money locked up for longer. However, this is flipped in an inversion of the yield curve, meaning yields on short-term bonds are higher than long-term bonds. This is rare and has become one of investors’ most trusted recession signals. This time, yields on five-year Treasuries, or US government debt, rose to 2.64pc - compared with 2.58pc for 30-year Treasuries. It was the first time this has happened since 2006. The most closely watched part of the yield curve is the difference between two-year and 10-year Treasuries. This is also on the brink of inverting. The inversion signals that investors expect central banks will need to cut interest rates in response to a recession, perhaps after tightening monetary policy too quickly. Yields on short-dated bonds have surged on mounting expectations of central banks responding to rampant inflation with higher interest rates. The US Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates as many as eight times this year with its chairman, Jerome Powell fueling hike bets with hawkish signals in recent weeks. The Bank of England is also expected to raise interest rates several times in the next 12 months. The US Treasury yield curve has been a reliable predictor of recessions in the world’s largest economy. The flipping of two-year and 10-year Treasury yields has been followed by a US recession every time it has happened in the last 50 years. The recession typically follows within 18 months. And when America sneezes, the world catches a cold. Some economists are already warning of rising recession risks in the UK as consumer confidence is battered by the cost of living crisis being worsened by the war in Ukraine. It could also spell trouble for stock markets with rapidly rising yields a potential headwind for shares. Althea Spinozzi, an analyst at Saxo Bank, explains: “This, at some point, is a dangerous moment for markets, as a steep back-up in treasury yields preceded every major bear market or market correction in recent decades, most infamously ahead of the 1987 crash, but also into early 2000, 2007 and 2018.”",Business/The Telegraph•3 hours ago,Why traders think the US economy is about to go into reverse,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-traders-think-us-economy-101927081.html

3/28/2022,"By Mike Spector (Reuters) - AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc Chief Executive Adam Aron said the movie-theater chain would embark on more ""transformational"" deals to capitalize on the interest of retail investors following its bet on a troubled gold and silver mine operator. AMC unveiled a $27.9 million investment for a 22% stake in Hycroft Mining Holding Corp about two weeks ago, an unusual deal for a company operating more than 900 theaters worldwide that raised eyebrows among market observers. AMC's investment called upon a $1.8 billion ""war chest"" it raised in 2021 by selling its shares in the open market, in part on the back of retail investors who turned it into a popular 'meme' stock. Aron said in a phone interview from a limousine in Los Angeles en route to the Academy Awards on Sunday that AMC's investment in Hycroft had done well from the start. AMC bought Hycroft shares at $1.07, and they were trading at $1.32 last week. ""I'd like to think there will be more third-party external M&A announcements going forward where AMC can reach for the stars and intriguing investments that have potentially attractive returns,"" Aron told Reuters. AMC's stock in mid-March had fallen to around $14 but rebounded to more than $20 following the Hycroft investment. Hycroft, which was on the verge of bankruptcy prior to a cash infusion from AMC and longtime precious-metals investor Eric Sprott, said on Friday it had subsequently raised nearly $195 million through open-market stock sales as other investors followed Aron's lead. Aron said he expects AMC's investment, which includes shares and warrants, to be ""lucrative."" The deal was disclosed March 15, the day after Aron's tour of the company's mining operations in Northern Nevada outside Winnemucca, not far from the site of the annual Burning Man arts and music festival. Some analysts questioned AMC's investment, expressing concern that the bet is far afield from the company's core competency and wondering whether the money could be better spent repaying the chain's debt, which exceeded $5 billion at the end of 2021. ""TRANSFORMATIONAL M&A"" Aron defended the bet on Hycroft in the Reuters interview, arguing that it drew on AMC's own experience skirting bankruptcy less than two years ago, and pointing out that it had the support of retail investors. ""Transformational M&A is mandatory. Our shareholder base has given us capital to deploy with the clear expectation that we are ... going to do exciting things with the money they entrusted to us,"" Aron said. He added that the nearly $28 million investment was small relative to AMC's total cash, and that the company would still strengthen and expand its core business. He cited AMC's recent acquisition of former Arclight and Pacific cinema locations, and said the company had plans to add more premium screens at existing theaters and retire some of its debt. Aron said Hycroft is a company with solid assets that faced a liquidity crisis that reminded him of AMC's dire straits not long ago. Sprott's involvement buoyed Aron's confidence, he said. ""While the Hycroft investment is pretty far from home, it does rely on a core competency of our company to understand balance sheets, and raising cash, and solving liquidity problems,"" Aron said. SHAREHOLDER FEEDBACK New deals will not necessarily be so out of the mainstream for AMC, Aron said, pointing to the company's recent decision to launch a co-branded credit card and its move to sell branded popcorn at retail establishments. The common denominator, he said, will be feedback from shareholders. He now tweets nearly once a day and follows about 2,500 AMC retail investors on the social-media website. Aron's tweets have been read more than 200 million times since April, he said. He added he has also hosted sneak previews of films for some of these investors, and expects to do perhaps a dozen more of them this year. On earnings calls, AMC now takes questions from retail investors in addition to securities analysts. That's a shift from the traditional conference calls and road shows that companies have relied upon for communicating with institutional shareholders. ""What's different is not the need to communicate with shareholders. What's different is who the shareholders are,"" Aron said.

3/28/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. gained in early trading after the carmaker said it plans to seek shareholder approval for a move that would enable its second stock split in roughly two years. Most Read from Bloomberg Low-Priced Omega Speedmaster Prompts Global Swatch Store Chaos Ukraine Update: Negotiators Set for Face-to-Face Talks This Week Will Smith Smacks Chris Rock, Wins Oscar in Wild Academy Awards Biden Seeks to Temper Remark on Putin as U.S. Allies Object Vanguard Stumbles In Pivot From Cult of Jack Bogle The company said in an oddly worded tweet early Monday that it will ask shareholders at this year’s annual meeting to authorize additional stock. In a follow-up regulatory filing, Tesla said increasing its amount of common shares will enable a split in the form of a stock dividend. Tesla surged as much as 6.5% to $1,076.12 in premarket trading, erasing earlier declines after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk announced on Twitter that he again has Covid-19 and is experiencing “almost no symptoms.” Tesla’s board has accepted the management proposal, but authorizing the dividend still requires final approval, the company said in its filing. In more indications the announcement was hastily made, Tesla said it will release a definitive proxy statement later with details of its plans, including the date and location of the annual meeting. Companies including Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have announced splits early this year to reduce the price of outstanding shares, making it easier for retail investors to afford them. Tesla soared after the company last announced a split in August 2020. The shares were added to the S&P 500 index later that year. Musk, 50, has been in a years-long feud with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the agency suing him and Tesla in 2018 after he tweeted about taking the company private. A judge signed off last week on the SEC’s plan to distribute the $40 million in penalties collected from the billionaire and Tesla to shareholders who lost money during that episode. The regulator also pushed back against Musk’s efforts to cease oversight of his Twitter posts. (Updates with Musk’s earlier announcement he has Covid-19 in the third paragraph.)

3/28/2022,"Payments on federal student loans are set to kick back in for roughly 37 million borrowers in just over a month. But with the May 1 end of the payment pause rapidly approaching, signals have been mixed on whether that deadline will be extended, leaving millions of borrowers in limbo with financial preparations. Payments on federal student loans were first halted in spring 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic plunged the country into an economic crisis. Since then, it has been extended multiple times, most recently by President Biden last December, when it was pushed to the current May 1 restart date. ""I think it's still up for grabs whether payments will be turned on or not,"" said Natalia Abrams, president and founder of the Student Debt Crisis Center. ""If in fact they are, borrowers are not ready to resume payments."" Last year, there were several rounds of communications ahead of the planned restart to help prepare borrowers — even though in the end the pause was extended. The Department of Education has said it will continue communicating directly with borrowers with clear and timely updates about repayments. The CARES Act requires at least six notifications about payments restarting, but those could all go out between now and May. With the new deadline looming, there are concerns. ""Most borrowers we have spoken to have not received any communications since near the end of January about loans restarting,"" said Abrams. Without a clear decision, borrowers have been left confused. ""If they're going to pause payments again, they need to do it sooner than later so people can balance their home budgets."" At the beginning of March, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain told Pod Save America a decision on any executive action for student debt forgiveness would be made before the payments resume or the president would extend the pause. When asked about forgiving student loan debt on CBS Mornings earlier this month, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said forgiveness is one thing but fixing the ""broken system"" is something they're working on as well. ""You don't really want to restart repayments and then a few months later forgive the loans,"" said student loan expert Mark Kantrowitz. ""So they really do need to figure out what the game plan is and then execute on it."" Multiple Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about preparations for the repayment restart or have called on the Biden administration to extend the pause. More than 43 million borrowers have more than $1.6 trillion in student loan debt, according to Education Department data. Nearly 37 million of those borrowers have not been required to make payments on their loan in two years — which amounts to $195 billion in waived payments through April, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found. In a recent survey by the Student Debt Crisis Center, 92% of fully-employed borrowers were concerned about being able to afford their payments due to rising inflation when the pause in May ends. One in three borrowers claimed they've reduced spending on necessities like food, rent and healthcare in preparation for payments to resume. ""The pandemic relief has helped people survive the economic shocks of the pandemic, but their financial situation remains the same if not worse because of inflation,"" said Cody Hounanian, executive director of the Student Debt Crisis Center. ""So restarting payments would be a disaster."" When the pandemic hit, nearly 100% of direct federal loans were in forbearance. As a result, previously delinquent loans – those behind on payments, but not in default – were marked as current. The New York Fed analysis warned when forbearance ends, direct borrowers are likely to experience a ""meaningful rise in delinquencies"" for both student debt and other debt. ""I think the Federal Reserve Bank of New York report was a little bit alarmist,"" said Kantrowitz. ""There are going to be some borrowers who are going to be late with their payments just like there were before. The question is, are there going to be more of them?"" As the payment pause deadline closes in – student loan experts have said borrowers should focus on their budgets in preparation. They should also make sure that their student loan servicers have their most up-to-date contact information. For those facing continued financial difficulties, there may be other options including deferments, forbearances and income-driven repayment plans for borrowers even after the federal pause ends. Such options should be discussed with a borrower's student loan servicer. Borrowers will have each already had about $5,500 canceled by May 1, thanks to loans not accruing interest during the pause. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which has called for the student loan payments to resume, found that will cost the U.S. more than $100 billion. They estimate extending the pause would cost an additional $50 billion per year.",U.S./CBS MoneyWatch•2 days ago,Borrowers waiting as May 1 student loan payment restart approaches,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/borrowers-waiting-may-1-student-132650780.html

3/28/2022,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Julien Ponthus. Storing wealth in cash is clearly a counter-intuitive call when inflation is surging towards double-digit figures for the first time in a generation. Yet, many investors are doing just that: BoFA said $13.2 billion was moved into cash last week and cash positions by fund managers earlier this month reached their highest levels since the pandemic market crash of March 2020. BofA analysts also warned that commodity prices were on track for their biggest increase in over a century while government bonds were set for their worst year since 1949 as central banks raise interest rates to tame surging inflation. With equity markets losing more than 5% so far this quarter, many investors may feel vindicated in deserting risky stock markets where dividends and capital gains are looking less attractive compared to fast-rising government bond yields. Yields on 10-year Treasuries have risen nearly 40% so far this month to 2.5% while in Germany, the Bund is closing to 0.6% and moving further away from negative territory which was its home for the past three years. The war in Ukraine, hard-pressured supply chains, a resurgent pandemic amid buoyant inflation is making this monetary tightening cycle particularly hard to manoeuvre. The picture, this last Monday morning of March 2022, is blurry as ever. The yen extended its descent to a six-year low after the Bank of Japan stepped into the market to stop government bond yields from rising and Asian shares retreated as a coronavirus lockdown in Shanghai weighed on sentiment. Oil prices are falling about $5 amid fears of weaker demand from China but are still at levels unseen since 2014. Some answers on the direction of travel from here are expected this week with surveys on global manufacturing, inflation readings and U.S. job data.

CSRC said that the recent talks with U.S. regulators have been efficient, candid, and professional, the newspaper said. The comments come days after the U.S. public company accounting regulator said that recent media speculation about an imminent deal with China was ""premature"", and it remained unclear if the Chinese government would grant the access required by a new U.S. listing law. Washington is demanding complete access to the books of U.S-listed Chinese companies, but Beijing bars foreign inspection of working papers from local accounting firms - a long-simmering auditing dispute that puts hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments at stake. The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks some of China's biggest tech companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc, jumped 3.6% on Monday morning, compared with a 1.3% gain in the benchmark index Hang Seng. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES But some analysts and investors remain sceptical that a solution will be found. ""Significant differences exist between the US and Chinese regulators,"" Hao Hong, head of research at BOCOM International, wrote on Monday. ""Many US-listed Chinese companies will face delisting eventually."" U.S. regulators require disclosure of government interest in the listed companies, as well as sensitive information and data, while the Chinese government ""has been tightening its control on many of China's biggest and most important companies,"" he added. To avert the delisting risk, New York-based asset manager Krane Funds Advisors said earlier this month that its $4.9 billion KraneShare CSI China Internet ETF aims to convert all Chinese American Depository Receipts (ADRs) in its portfolio into their Hong Kong shares in the coming months. Chinese regulators have asked some of the country's U.S.-listed firms, including Alibaba, Baidu and JD.com, to prepare for more audit disclosures as Beijing steps up efforts to ensure they remain listed in New York, Reuters reported last week. The Financial Times and Bloomberg News also reported this month that China's securities watchdog is weighing a proposal that would allow U.S. regulators to inspect auditors' working papers for some companies as soon as this year. CSRC cautioned market participants not to blindly believe in speculation by some media with little knowledge of the details and direction of the talks, as such reports caused unnecessary disturbances to market expectations, the China Securities Journal reported on Sunday.

3/28/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are scrambling for safety as risks mount, from the war in Ukraine to rising interest rates and a global recession. They have found it in the U.S. stock market -- particularly the biggest American companies.

Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 has gained almost 11% over the same span. With earnings looking strong and corporate outlooks improving, there are reasons to think these gains can hold despite the myriad risks facing global equities. “It bothers people because they feel like the market is heartless,” Nancy Tengler, chief executive and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments, said in a phone interview. “And that’s correct.” Read: Market Gloom Triggers BofA’s Contrarian ‘Buy Signal’ for Stocks The fighting set off a spike in commodity prices, stoking inflation that already was at a four-decade high. Meanwhile, sanctions on Moscow threaten to weigh on global economic growth. Recession risks in the U.S. are also piling up, with parts of the Treasury yield curve inverting as the Federal Reserve embarks on a new tightening cycle. Perhaps most puzzling is the fact that the world’s biggest stock markets haven’t collapsed. The STOXX Europe 600 Index is basically flat since Russia invaded Ukraine. The MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index is down a little more than 3% in that span and the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index has lost around 7.5%, largely because of growth fears and the risk of Chinese firms being kicked off U.S. exchanges. For now, American stocks appear to be the best option for global investors, particularly compared with bonds. The return on global government debt weighted by world GDP is on course for its worst year since 1949, according to Bank of America. “The view is we should just rotate to sectors which are more favorable to the situation, because there’s really not much of an alternative to equities,” said Ilya Feygin, managing director and senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital. Earnings Strength Large-cap stocks in the U.S. offer more safety and value than small- and mid-cap shares since they tend to generate reliable income for investors, especially companies that can maintain dividend payouts. In addition, the U.S. equity market’s swoon to start the year may have largely priced in a spike in oil prices and softening of economic growth, meaning they aren’t as expensive anymore, according to Tengler. “U.S. large-cap stocks are havens because they’re reliable growers and don’t have a ton of debt,” Tengler said. “This is an opportunity to get higher-quality companies on sale.” Another leg of support for U.S. stocks has been improving expectations for first quarter S&P 500 earnings-per-share growth, which have increased for three straight weeks, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. “Stocks appear to have largely priced in near-term geopolitical and interest-rate risks,” Gina Martin Adams, chief equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a note. “Earnings forecasts are climbing again, as analysts get more comfortable with supply-chain risks and revenue estimates keep improving.” Resilient Tech Investors also are finding comfort in American corporations thanks to the huge piles of cash on their balance sheets amassed during the pandemic. As a result, U.S. companies are stepping up share buybacks to records. S&P 500 firms bought back $882 billion in stock last year, up 9.3% from the prior record set in 2018, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Cyber stocks have also been a bright spot, while semis are attractive since they’re the backbone of the digital world.” All that being said, there are still risks because historical recession indicators have been flashing warning signs to investors but are sending mixed messages. The gap between yields on two-year and 10-year Treasuries has narrowed, while the spread between 10-year and three-month Treasuries is actually steepening. Both measures have predicted recessions in the past. From a technical perspective, the S&P 500 is at a key inflection point now that it has crossed back above its 200-day moving average. If it can stay over that level and move beyond February’s highs around 4,590 (it’s currently about 4,543) it could signal that the market is on an upward trajectory. If it fails, however, it will likely be a sign that a counter-trend rally has been unfolding. “History shows that markets initially see a significant drop on concerns about a war. Then often times a recovery happens once the act has occurred,” Beiley said. “What could change my mind? Something worse happening. We don’t know how things will end between Russia and Ukraine. That’s a big concern. Does it escalate or get worse?” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Silicon Valley’s Wealthiest Russian Is Carefully—Very Carefully—Distancing Himself From Putin Hong Kong’s Completely Avoidable Covid Catastrophe An iPhone Subscription Would Boost Apple’s Profit Germany Doubles Military Spending, But Can’t Rearm Overnight Private Equity Funds Are Pushing Deeper Into Pro Sports ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•20 hours ago,U.S. Big Cap Stocks Turn Into World’s Top Haven as Risk Rises,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-big-cap-stocks-turn-170000811.html
