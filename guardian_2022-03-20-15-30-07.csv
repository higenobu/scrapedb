3/20/2022,"So here we are, the spring equinox – arriving mid- afternoon, depending on where you are reading this – the start of the prime days of rising sun and hope and gardening. It begins a little later in Denmark. But here, too, signs of spring are read reverentially. The beach rugosa is in leaf bud. The honeysuckle’s shooting. Even further east and north, winter’s hold loosens. We were back in Denmark recently for Ina’s birthday. We had her out for a long spring lunch at the summerhouse. Small glasses of good red wine. Henri’s famous chocolate cake (adapted from an old one of Ina’s). A cool sunny day, a firm grip on my arm, the garden snowdrops popping through the last remains – we hope – of the blizzards. We picked one for a glass on the table. Crocuses, too, are spreading: purples, creams, warm oranges. Last autumn’s new narcissi are poking through. We’ll see if the deer leave them alone. We’d planted winter aconite under the copper birch. It is good to see it has taken. The forsythia is in flower bud. We’ll hope to catch it in full glory at Easter. I top up the bird feeders to help get them through. Different feeds for different species, though the pheasants aren’t fussy with the scattered seeds and nuts. The male struts and shouts. The female focuses on feeding. I know it was early in the first days of March, but I couldn’t resist spreading wild meadow seed and nasturtium. Perhaps the cherry trees will start to show by the time we return. We’ll wander round, eyes alert for the smallest sign of change. For the shy naturalised tulips, the snakes head fritillary dotted through the meadow. It will be time to sow calendula. For buns and tea outside with Ina. A slow walkabout.

3/20/2022,"Thirty years ago, Basic Instinct was all anyone could talk about. Before our current age of Insta-controversies and aggregated showbiz news, it was widely known that screenwriter Joe Eszterhas had sold his screenplay for a record $3m and that demonstrators in San Francisco, including Eszterhas himself, had protested against the film’s association of lesbianism with violent psychosis. It was known that director Paul Verhoeven had battled the MPAA from an NC-17 rating to the hardest of R ratings in the states, and it took no time for buzz to circulate about the famed interrogation scene, where Catherine Trammell, the author and might-be murderess played by Sharon Stone, uncrosses her legs before a roomful of sweat-drenched men. (The odious trickery behind that shot, however, was still unknown.) It would not be accurate to think about an artist of Verhoeven’s stature as a troll, exactly, but he’s a button-pusher of the first order. While his films, including last year’s nunsploitation howler Benedetta, have an underlying seriousness to their provocations, he also enjoys poking the hornet’s nest, seizing every opportunity to razz the scolds. Basic Instinct is a lively, sexy and fitfully repugnant vulgarization of film noir, targeting American audiences with such surgical precision that its title refers as much to them as the pleasure-seeking lunatics on screen. Even though he was from Holland, Verhoeven understood better than anyone in Hollywood the puritanical response of sex and violence, how it could attract and repulse simultaneously. Like a chemist splashing around with acids and bases, he knew how to produce heat. Still, Basic Instinct was a less sui generis phenomenon than a studio finding the right person for the job. The $3m spent on Eszterhas’s embarrassing but crudely effective screenplay was a small gamble on the hundreds of millions Fatal Attraction had made a few years earlier, also starring Michael Douglas as the aggrieved victim of his own desire. Verhoeven just did the formula one better: he had already given a knife to a Hitchcockian blonde in his great Dutch thriller The Fourth Man, and Basic Instinct allowed him to do it again in San Francisco, the home of Hitchcock’s Vertigo. And he had a mandate to shock. It takes no time for him to follow through. To the swells of Jerry Goldsmith’s score – a brilliant Harlequin-ization of something Hitchcock’s composer, Bernard Herrmann, might have done — Verhoeven starts with a suggestive dance of images around a blurry reflective surface before finally sharpening focus on a ceiling mirror above two wriggling bodies below. The woman on top, her blond hair obscuring her face, reaches first for a white silk scarf to tie her man’s wrists to the bedposts. Then she reaches for an ice pick and repeatedly, savagely stabs him in the face and chest. (How savage? Rob Bottin, the legendary effects and makeup artist of The Thing and Verhoeven’s Total Recall, went all out again here.) The victim is a retired rock star who never retired from sex and drugs. “He got off before he got off,” cracks an investigator on the scene, spouting one of Eszterhas’s million-dollar one-liners. As Nick Curran, the ultimate cop-on-the-edge type, Douglas returned to the city that helped make his career with the TV policer The Streets of San Francisco, but his detective here follows his impulses as much as he does evidence – and more often than not, confuses the two. That makes him an ideal mark for Catherine, who presents such an open-and-shut case as the perpetrator that the obviousness of her guilt becomes her best defense. Not only is she the victim’s longtime sex partner, spotted leaving a club with him the night of the murder, but she wrote a novel about killing a rock star. Nick comes around to her line of thinking, in no small part because he’s drawn into pansexual orbit, despite her stated intent to write a new book abouta cop who’s slain after falling for the wrong woman. Eszterhas’s script adds a couple of steamy alternatives to Catherine, like her jealous lesbian lover Roxy (Leilani Sarelle) and Nick’s ex-lover Beth Garner (Jeanne Tripplehorn), a police psychologist shielding him from an internal affairs investigation. There’s also endless business about Catherine’s past, in which her billionaire parents and Berkeley psychology professor died under mysterious circumstances. In one of the film’s more quietly ridiculous scenes, Nick finds Catherine at home crying over the many, many, many people in her life who seem to die prematurely. She weeps about 10 feet away from an ice pick. She likes “rough edges” in her drinks. One of Verhoeven’s strongest qualities as a film-maker is that he’s sophisticated without ever needing to be respectable, which allows for a film as unabashedly tawdry and “wrong” as Basic Instinct to plumb depths that mere exploitation never can. Verhoeven knows enough about cinema to realize that he can’t turn the clock back on noir, so his solution is to make the implicit explicit and allow the sexual and intellectual confidence of his femme fatale to devour the entire film. Though Stone was far down the list of actors offered the role – most flatly rejected it, given the requirements of the job – she makes any other choice seem unthinkable in retrospect. Vertigo is about a woman (and then, a second woman) who is held captive by a man’s obsession; Basic Instinct has the man held captive, and Catherine is the one pulling the strings, often accompanied by Stone’s half-sinister/half-seductive grin. At the same time, it’s not revisionist thinking to recoil at certain moments in Basic Instinct, like Nick pushing past consensual boundaries with Beth or suggesting to Roxy that they talk “man to man”. And it’s just simple good taste to laugh at Eszterhas’s over-cranked writing, which Verhoeven does not tamp down here any more than he would later with Showgirls. But the fact is that nothing like Basic Instinct could come out of risk-averse Hollywood today, at least not on the scale that might propel it to the center of American culture. The thirst is still there, with precious little to slake it.",Arts/Film,Basic Instinct at 30: a lurid throwback to when Hollywood still took risks,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/20/basic-instinct-sharon-stone-michael-douglas-hollywood-film-30-years
3/20/2022,"Tesco Finest Soave Classico Superiore, Italy 2021 (£7.50, Tesco) What do you reckon is the price you have to pay to get a decent bottle of wine? When I carried out a little straw poll of friends and acquaintances that like and regularly buy – but aren’t obsessed by – wine this week, the figure that kept coming back was “around a tenner” usually followed by a slightly despondent “these days”. That doesn’t mean the majority of my respondents always or even often buy wine at that price (most only rarely broke that threshold). But they did have a sense that the kind of thing that used to be around £6 “four or five years ago” is now more likely £10, and that the quality of wine they can afford to buy these days is, therefore, now much lower. I can’t say I disagree for the most part, but that isn’t to say it’s impossible to find good stuff for much less than that: Tesco’s gently insinuating dry white Soave being a case in point. Sorcova Pinot Noir, Banat, Romania 2020 (£5.99, reduced from £7.99 from Wednesday 23 March, Waitrose) The average price of a bottle in the UK has gradually crept up in recent years so that it is in fact around £6.10. A combination of duty, VAT, various production and transport costs, and (often very slim) retailer and supplier margins means that you get around 90p’s worth of wine for your £6.10. That is a considerable step up on the 25p’s worth you get in a £5 bottle of wine, but some way short of the £1.40 that, according to my calculations, is what you get in the Tesco Soave, and the £2.65 you get if you go up to a tenner. Basically, because a lot of the costs on a bottle of wine are fixed no matter the price, you get a much bigger proportion of your money spent on the actual wine the more you spend. That doesn’t necessarily map onto quality or enjoyment, however: I got more juicy, red-fruited pleasure from Waitrose’s Romanian than I have from many a pinot at two or three times the price. LB7 Red, Lisboa, Portugal (£8.49, or £5.99 as part of a case of six, Majestic) Some countries, regions and producers are much more likely sources of that elusive beast, the Good Cheap Wine, than others, of course. Some combination of lack of reputation, low land and labour costs, and size of producer are among the factors that contribute to a wine defying the low expectations that come with a very low price. Romania is one such place, and Cramele Recas (the name behind Sorcova), one such producer. Other places that have more than their share of GCWs (which I’m going to define as genuinely pleasurable bottles at less than the average UK price) include Hungary, southern France, Sicily and Puglia in Italy, and various producers in various regions of Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Spain and Portugal. Two that fit the description: the sweetly brambly succulence of Portugal’s LB7 Red (if you buy by the mixed case of six bottles) and The Co-op’s softly approachable Hungarian white, Is This It? Pinot Blanc (£5.50, down from £6.50, until 5 April).

3/20/2022,"The question I have realised that after two years of working from home I cannot work in an office. My manager has recently mandated that we all work from the office on certain days of the week. I now spend half an hour each way crammed into a smelly, dirty train. I started this job during the pandemic, so I was nervous to go into the office and meet my colleagues. Well, my worst fears came true, because on my first day, the first colleague I met tried to get me fired. He said I wasn’t wearing my lanyard and reported it to my boss. Since then I’ve met the rest of the team and I experienced a not insubstantial amount of sectarianism and sexism. But it’s not just that. I now find I’m hypersensitive to any noise. I’m acutely sensitive to people chewing with their mouths open, slurping soup and gossiping loudly. Not only that, but my stomach rumbles and I find it excruciatingly embarrassing. I want the ground to swallow me up. Working from home, none of this was an issue. I can’t go on like this. Aside from getting a medical certificate, which I obviously don’t want to do, how can I approach my office to request I work from home permanently? Philippa’s answer There are many like you who got used to working from home. Comfort zones for being with colleagues appear to have, in many people’s experience, diminished. During the pandemic, it was repeatedly implied to us that other people were dangerous, potential killers, even. Shops and offices are still full of signs reminding us to keep our distance and wash our hands. Every factual TV series made since the pandemic shows people standing far apart from each other with an unnatural distance. This is all very sensible as a precaution against the virus, but what has it done to our psyches? It has reinforced any anxiety we may have had about others and made us more wary of our fellow human beings. It makes me sad. After so long being on our own, the sounds and smells of other people may very well feel jarring. We got used to the quiet and now normal noise feels horribly over-stimulating and the situation has made us even more conscious of the normal noises our bodies make. Many people report feeling overstimulated and exhausted after re-entry post lockdown. I was among them. Many of us have had to build up again gradually, and I think you will need to do this, too. Like many creatures, human beings are pack animals. If you remove a fruit fly from its fellow fruit flies, isolate it and then re-introduce it into the swarm, it doesn’t plunge back into the centre, but hides around the edges. It is as though it got used to loneliness and dare not risk what might feel like further rejection by diving back in. I’ve heard the same thing happens with rats, and for sure after isolation we humans feel shyer and hypervigilant for potential rejection. There are two things we can do with these feelings of fear and distrust: we can be ruled by the feeling and stay hidden, or we can feel the fear and join in anyway. If we hide, we carry on feeding our fears, but if we dare to feel them and act in spite of them, they will gradually diminish as we establish relationships and re-enter the fray, even when we had believed we would not. I don’t think you’ll get fired for forgetting your lanyard. How kind of your colleague to ask your boss if you had been issued with one (there’s always another interpretation for a story). Forming cliques is universal within all human groups and we won’t educate anyone about sexism by hiding away. It can be awkward joining a group that is already established, as relationships take time. But what is good about them at work is that the cliché of two brains being better than one is true. We can have video meetings, but so much more creativity and problem-solving happens chatting by the water cooler. When you enter a full room and think no one will be interested in you and other people are all horrible, what vibe do you give off? But if you walk in expecting everyone to be kind, interesting and attractive and you are, too, how different would your demeanour be? And what difference would that make to the experience? I doubt there is harm in telling your boss that you work better at home, but it’s not guaranteed to work. I would encourage you, instead, to realise not all humans are all bad, and some of them are really great and will be fun and interesting to work with. You have been searching for evidence to the contrary; I want you instead, to search for the good. It’s time to be a little bit more optimistic about what people are like and gently push out the edges of your comfort zone, so that you can ease yourself back in and be less anxious about being part of a group again. You have an advantage over the fruit fly – you can decide to acknowledge your instincts, understand them and choose to override them.

3/20/2022,"As a forensic pathologist, the dead of all ages, shapes and sizes have been the focus of my career. Numerous times a day, for the past 40 years, I have looked closely and directly at death, knowing that, for many – probably most – of the people I examine, the start of their final day had been completely normal. Death had come swiftly and unexpectedly. So, as I dress each morning, I often wonder where I will be at the end of my day. At home? Or in a mortuary, being slid into a fridge on a shiny tray? In medical circles, we had been expecting a global pandemic for several decades. The HIV/Aids pandemic of the 80s was a sombre milestone, resulting in about 36 million deaths worldwide, but I never anticipated that the first pandemic of the 21st century would develop from a virus in China. I had expected it to come from a lethal reorganisation of the DNA of the influenza virus – as happened in 1918, when “Spanish” flu killed at least 50 million people worldwide, and in the subsequent, less lethal, influenza pandemics: 2 million died in the 1957 flu pandemic and 1 million each in 1968 and 1977. The last notable flu pandemic was swine flu, in 2009, which resulted in about 500,000 deaths. A serious influenza pandemic is about 50 years overdue. I know that I am unusual in having had such a longstanding personal insight into death and the fundamentally precarious nature of our lives. Many of us have never seen a dead body, even of a close relative. In our westernised, urban society, the tradition of paying your respects to the body in an open coffin in the parlour is now rare. This offered the opportunity to recognise the normality of death: to look it in the face; to consider your responses; to remember your own impermanence. By the start of this century, it seemed to me that death had become a subject generally to be avoided, glossed over, obfuscated and (if at all possible) simply ignored, at least until one was faced with it personally. Now, the lack of this experience often means it feels overwhelming. Before Covid, I noticed how our language was becoming increasingly euphemistic. The noun is “death”, the verb is “die”, but these words were seldom heard. Dying had become “passing” – and the focus was usually on “easing that passing”, to sanitise and smooth it and manage death in a way that diverted distress. I felt I was seeing a significant disconnect develop between the profound, human process of grieving, with its incumbent pain, stress and sadness, and the emollient aims of the death industry. It was a disconnect that was welcomed by so many. The pandemic challenged this approach in almost every respect. Suddenly, death and the consequences of death were the focus, day after day, of every news report. The facts were raw and painful, the words stark. The noun was “death”, the verb was “die”. These people had not “passed”. Covid, I hate your harvest, but I thank you for rewilding such endangered language. As the pandemic continued, interviews with families became the modern equivalent of the wake beside the coffin in the parlour. Where once there was little or no desire to see the body after death, now the denial of contact, at the end of life and afterwards, was traumatising. I hope one positive to come out of our new reality is a change in society’s approach to death. It is still too early to tell – and perhaps I never will be able to tell, since I am inside the taboo, looking out. But, from my perspective, I would say that a new willingness to engage with death would be a healthy change. I have been lucky. Few of my close family have contracted Covid; none have died from it or even been hospitalised. However, during the course of the pandemic, three of my friends have died: two from natural disease – one suddenly, one slowly and painfully – and one from an accident. Covid has killed many, but, even in the depths of a pandemic, I was reminded that people continue to die of other causes – and that these causes also kill millions. Let us face up to the inescapable fact that humans die. Until then, life is for living. Dr Richard Shepherd is a pathologist and an author. The Seven Ages of Death is out now (Michael Joseph, £20).

3/20/2022,"The LaLee, The Cadogan, 75 Sloane Street, London SW1X 9SG (020 8089 7070). Starters £14-£20, mains £18-£49, desserts £6-£9.50, wines from £29 Restaurants aren’t merely dining rooms with kitchens attached. They are complex machines with invisible moving parts. Get the design wrong and it’s all grind and shudder, as if you’re on a train riding the breaks into Warrington Bank Quay. The design of the LaLee at the Cadogan hotel in Chelsea is all wrong. It doesn’t quite function. It feels like a restaurant put together by excitable designers who were thrilled with their cloth swatches, and their rug choices and the overall branding, but whose attention drifted during the meetings when the hotel’s food and beverage people explained what kind of a joint they actually had in mind. Let’s start with the branding. The LaLee was the name of the personalised railway carriage used by Lillie Langtry, the actor and society figure, when she was touring America in the 19th century. The link being that Langtry’s townhouse at 21 Pont Street is now a part of the hotel. This is not the first time the Cadogan has attempted to cash in on her name. A couple of owners back they opened a car crash of a place called Langtry’s, where the menu included a deconstructed prawn cocktail – shellfish jelly, battered prawns, a Marie Rose ice-cream made from mayonnaise and tomato ketchup – thoughts of which sometimes haunt me in the darkest hours before dawn. None of the food here is as catastrophic as that, but the link is made uneasily. Langtry is portrayed in the menu text as a woman whose only currency was sex appeal; as the proverbial good time had by all. Starters are introduced as “a little flirtation before the main event”. Desserts are “scandalously sweet to make you swoon”. This might work if you were here on a date, but rather less so if, say, you’d booked in for lunch with Derek from accounts so you could go over the year-end numbers. The mains are described as “heavenly main dishes from Europe’s finest cities”. This amounts to a schnitzel, steak and chips, a rack of lamb, an aubergine parmigiana for two and so on, all at Chelsea prices, that price being roughly £30 a pop. It’s sold as high glamour. In truth, it’s a menu designed for well-heeled tourists on the fourth day of their London trip when they can’t be fagged to leave the hotel to eat. So why did I bother going? For one reason: they also promise culinary tableside theatre. I’m a complete sucker for this. I love it when a skilled waiter turns up next to my table with a box of tricks and some killer moves to prepare my dinner in front of me. It’s very old school and it’s utterly beguiling. Here they promise to do the business with both a Caesar salad and a steak tartare. Which is where it all gets a bit messy. A trolley might be a good idea for this. Instead, they’ve got white, spindly- legged wooden tables, which may be very expensive, but look instead like allen key jobs from the Ikea New England Cottage range. Moving them is a two-person task. While we wait to be served, there’s much table moving from one plushly furnished room to another. Oh look, they’re coming back again. Finally, it’s our turn. And it is tableside. It’s just not our tableside. Presumably it’s the designer who has insisted on arranging the room in such a way that the one for the Caesar has to be placed a full 5ft away from us to our left across the aisle next to a booth. The steak tartare table is far over the other side of the unoccupied table to our right. This makes watching the whole theatre you’ve come for very tricky. There simply isn’t room to pull off the thing they want to do. (Similarly, the rug on the parquet floor isn’t big enough for all the tables in this room, so one foot of my chair is off when we arrive, creating an instant wobble. We take things into our own hands and rearrange the furniture.) But as ever, I must accentuate the positive. The waiters do a truly beautiful job, even if we have to crane our necks to watch them do it. The mayonnaise for the Caesar really is whipped up from scratch and the cos salad is big on the salted anchovies, as I requested. The steak tartare is properly piquant, again as requested. A bit of toast wouldn’t have gone amiss with the latter given the £20 price tag, but hey. Still, both dishes really are as good as any you’ll find in London right now. After that, it’s all about as humdrum as you might imagine from the menu descriptions: serviceable lamb chops that could have done with more time under the grill; a meagre half fillet of sea bass for £26 with some fennel; overly thick courgette fries, so the overcoat of batter is undercooked at the heart. Dessert is just unfortunate. A madeleine served warm from the oven is a joy. These are overcooked and dry. The savarin, or yeasted sponge cake at the heart of the rum baba, should be a gorgeous, bronzed and burnished thing. This is just an oversoaked puck of dense sponge. Still, it’s a nice place for dinner and a quiet chat. Or it would be, were it not for the stern man in the next room who keeps shouting. Because the LaLee has a big open kitchen. These can be great in chattery, clattery brasseries where the kitchen noise disappears into the general hubbub. They can also work in those high gastronomic temples where the monastic brigade has developed a sign language involving the positioning of tweezers on their apron straps and imperceptible hand gestures. The LaLee is neither of these. It’s a mildly chintzy place of quiet, civilised conversation, constantly broken by the head chef barking orders at his crew, as if the kitchen is behind a door. For the diners who have chosen the two tables in front of the kitchen I imagine it’s fine. For the rest of us it’s just plain weird. I’ve long felt sympathy for cooks who merely want to do their job, but have been put on display in an open kitchen as part of the experience. Here, because of the jarring way in which the place has been designed, that issue is just emphasised. It rather sums up the LaLee. It’s attempting to be a thrilling destination restaurant, when in truth it should just be the utilitarian dining option in a fancy boutique London hotel. As a result, it’s neither. Ukrainians coming to the UK to escape the war will need more than just somewhere to live. As the government’s delayed scheme to enable people to seek refuge here finds its feet, the Sanctuary Foundation has been established to enable individuals, community bodies and businesses to offer support, including jobs.

3/20/2022,"Days before Afghanistan fell to the Taliban last August, Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan president, was “welcomed” to the United Arab Emirates. He was alleged to have taken with him $169m, from his country’s treasury. Six months on, Khalid Payenda, once Ghani’s finance minister, is driving an Uber in Washington DC. “If I complete 50 trips in the next two days, I receive a $95 bonus,” Payenda told the Washington Post, from behind the wheel of a Honda Accord. The 40-year-old once oversaw a US-supported $6bn budget. The Post reported that in one night earlier this week, he made “a little over $150 for six hours’ work, not counting his commute – a mediocre night”. The Post recorded Payenda telling one passenger his move from Kabul to Washington had been “quite an adjustment”. He also said he was grateful for the opportunity to be able to support his family but, “Right now, I don’t have any place. I don’t belong here and I don’t belong there. It’s a very empty feeling.” Afghanistan faces a humanitarian and economic crisis, assets frozen and cut off from international aid that would require recognition of the Taliban government which replaced the US-supported regime. The Post described Payenda’s experience in late 2020, when his mother died of Covid-19 in an impoverished Kabul hospital. He became finance minister after that. The Post said he now wished he had not. “I saw a lot of ugliness, and we failed,” he said. “I was part of the failure. It’s difficult when you look at the misery of the people and you feel responsible.” Payenda told the Post he believed Afghans “didn’t have the collective will to reform, to be serious”. But he also said the US betrayed its commitment to democracy and human rights after making Afghanistan a centerpiece of post-9/11 policy. “Maybe there were good intentions initially but the United States probably didn’t mean this,” Payenda said. Payenda resigned as finance minister a week before the Taliban seized Kabul, as his relationship with Ghani deteriorated. Fearing the president would have him arrested, he left for the US, where he joined his family. “We had 20 years and the whole world’s support to build a system that would work for the people,” Payenda said in a text message to a World Bank official in Kabul on the day the capital fell, quoted by the Post. “All we built was a house of cards that came down crashing this fast. A house of cards built on the foundation of corruption.”",News/World news,Afghanistan’s former finance minister is now Uber driver in Washington DC,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/afghanistans-former-finance-minister-is-now-uber-driver-in-washington-dc
3/20/2022,"For nearly a month, Vladimir Putin has delivered a daily masterclass in incompetence and brutality. The ex-KGB spymaster and world-class kleptocrat was the guy Donald Trump wanted to be. Just weeks ago, the former president lavished praise on his idol and derided Nato as “not so smart”. How’s that working out, Donald? The world cheers for Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Ukraine, his besieged country. Russia’s economy is on its knees, its stock market shuttered, its shelves bare. The rouble is worth less than a penny. The west is not as decadent or as flaccid as the tyrant-in-the-Kremlin and President Bone-Spurs bet. With impeccable timing, Marie Yovanovitch delivers Lessons from the Edge, her memoir. The author is the former US ambassador to Ukraine who Trump fired during his attempt to withhold aid to Kyiv in return for political dirt, an effort that got him impeached. For the first time. Yovanovitch tells a story of an immigrant’s success. But, of course, her short but momentous stint in the last administration receives particular attention. On the page, Yovanovitch berates Trump for “his obsequiousness to Putin”, which she says was a “frequent and continuing cause for concern” among the diplomatic corps. Trump, she writes, saw “Ukraine as a ‘loser’ country, smaller and weaker than Russia”. If only thousands of dead Russian troops could talk. Trump was commander-in-chief but according to Yovanovitch, he didn’t exactly have the best handle on where his soldiers were deployed. At an Oval Office meeting in 2017 with Petro Poroshenko, then president of Ukraine, Trump asked HR McMaster, his national security adviser, if US troops were deployed in Donbas in eastern Ukraine, territory now invoked by Putin as grounds for his invasion. “An affirmative answer to that question would have meant that the United States was in a shooting war with Russia,” Yovanovitch writes. In the moment, she says, she also pondered if it was “better to interpret Trump’s question as suggesting that the commander-in-chief thought it possible that US troops were fighting Russia-led forces, or instead as an indicator that the president wasn’t clear which country was on the other side of the war against Ukraine”. Let that sink in. And remember this. According to Mary Trump, the former president’s niece, Trump mocked his father as he succumbed to Alzheimer’s. Yovanovitch’s parents fled the Nazis, then the Soviets. She was born in Canada and her family moved to the US when she was three. Later she received an offer from Smith, an all-women’s school in Massachusetts, but opted for Princeton. It had gone co-ed less than a decade earlier but Yovanovitch counted on it being more fun. In her memoir, she devotes particular attention to snubs and put-downs endured on account of gender. One of her professors, a European history specialist, announced that he opposed women being admitted. After that, Yovanovitch stayed silent during discussion. It was only after she received an A, she writes, that the professor noticed her and made sure to include her. She really had something to say. Lessons from the Edge also recalls a sex discrimination lawsuit brought in 1976 by Alison Palmer, a retired foreign service officer, against the US Department of State. The case was settled, but only in 1989 and with an acknowledgment of past wrongs by the department. State had “disproportionately given men the good assignments”, Palmer said. Yovanovitch writes: “I felt – and still feel – tremendous gratitude to [her] for fighting for me and so many other women.” Yovanovitch would serve in Moscow and as US ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Ukraine. She worked with political appointees and careerists. She offers particular praise for Republicans of an earlier, saner era. She lauds George Shultz, Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state, for professionalism and commitment to country. Shultz reminded new ambassadors that “my” country meant the US, not their place of posting. He also viewed diplomacy as a constant effort, as opposed to a spasmodic intervention. Yovanovitch also singles out James Baker, secretary of state to George HW Bush, for helping the president forge a coalition to win the Gulf war. “Department folks found him cold and aloof,” Yovanovitch recalls. “But it was clear immediately that he was a master of diplomacy.” Baker showed flashes of idealism. The US stood for something. As younger men, both Shultz and Baker were marines. In marked contrast, Yovanovitch gives the Trump administration a thumping. She brands Rex Tillerson’s 14-month tenure as secretary of state as “near-disastrous”. As for Tillerson’s successor, Mike Pompeo, Yovanovitch lambasts his “faux swagger” and his refusal to defend her when she came under attack from Trump and his minions. Amid Trump’s first impeachment, over Ukraine, Yovanovitch testified: “The policy process is visibly unravelling … the state department is being hollowed out.” Loyalty to subordinates was not Pompeo’s thing – or Trump’s. “Lick what’s above you, kick what’s below you” – that was more their mantra. True to form, in 2020 Pompeo screamed at a reporter: “Do you think Americans give a fuck about Ukraine?” Two years later, they do. At the same time, Pompeo nurses presidential ambitions. Good luck with that. Yovanovitch rightly places part of the blame for Putin’s invasion on Trump. “He saw Ukraine as a pawn that could be bullied into doing his bidding,” she said in a recent interview. “I think that made a huge impact on Zelenskiy and I think that Putin and other bad actors around the world saw that our president was acting in his own personal interests.” What comes next for the US, Ukraine and Russia? Pressure mounts on the Biden administration to do more for Ukraine – at the risk of nuclear conflict. Congressional Republicans vote against aid to Zelenskiy but demand a more robust US response. Recently, Trump admitted that he was “surprised” by Putin’s “special military operation”. He “thought he was negotiating”, he said. A very stable genius, indeed.

3/20/2022,"Nick Cohen’s excoriating analysis of the government’s unforgivably cold-hearted response to Ukrainian refugees nails it precisely: Boris Johnson and Priti Patel demean us all in their assumption that most of us are racist and xenophobic (“The Tories claim we are worse than we are – and it’s the Ukrainians who suffer”, Comment). They are wrong. Even before the tragedy of Ukraine, poll after poll showed that most people want to be kind and decent to those seeking refuge. But Johnson and Patel pay attention only to that minority who don’t. And whip them up. In my own small town of Hastings, local refugee support groups have a strong presence, and collectively many thousands of followers on social media. When tiny boats crammed with desperate refugees arrived on our beaches a few months ago, there was an outpouring of support, including over £34,000 collected in a few days in hundreds of donations by local people. The response to the people now fleeing the tragedy in Ukraine is similarly powerful. Over 1,260 have signed a petition to our MP urging her to oppose the nationality and borders bill and vote for the Lords’ amendments which threw out so many of its iniquities. On the streets, in the pubs, the cafes, the churches, we find an empathy that far outweighs the repulsive narrative so mendaciously claimed as what “the British people want”. A few days ago, a local fisherman told me that he had been instructed by Border Force to report any dinghies in the Channel but to let them drift. “I’m not doing that!” he declared. “On sea, no matter who it is, no matter where they come from or why, everyone is my responsibility – let them drift? Hah!” We are desperate to be listened to by our own parliamentary representative, a fellow party member with Patel and Johnson. Patel and Johnson may lack any smidgen of the imaginative capacity needed to empathise with our fellow humans who are fleeing for their lives – but most of the rest of us are better than that.Felicity LaurenceHastings, East Sussex The headline of your article gave the impression that museums are failing to make any difference to the lives of pupils (“Why a day out at the museum won’t result in better exam grades”, News). Nothing could be further from the truth – museums across the UK worked hard throughout the pandemic to ensure that children had access to engaging experiences of culture, art, science and history. These experiences are not designed to help children pass specific exams, but to contribute to their wider development and understanding of the world. As your article recognises, there are numerous other recent studies that demonstrate the broader development and wellbeing benefits that museum visits can bring. Museums are brilliant places for discovering who we are, where we have come from and what we might become. There is no exam for that.Maria Balshaw, chair, National Museum Directors’ Council; Sharon Heal, director, Museums Association; Andrew Lovett, chair, Association of Independent Museums; Jenny Waldman, director, Art Fund I must take issue with the framing of some of Rachel Cooke’s assertions and questions in her interview with Ed Miliband (the New Review). It is irritating to read that “the Jeremy Corbyn years (were) a disastrous period for the Labour party”, with no qualification or analysis of whether that was actually the case. In 2017, Theresa May was expected to increase her majority; instead, Labour demolished it, winning over 40% of the vote for the first time in decades. Corbyn was able to communicate Labour’s optimistic and transformative agenda precisely because so few figures in the mainstream press believed he was a serious contender. The result appeared to terrify liberal and conservative journalists alike, who spent the next two years recasting Corbyn as some sort of folk devil, even as Labour party membership rose to over 560,000 and its MPs enjoyed the fruits of their – temporarily – vastly increased majorities. Their efforts made a substantive contribution to the genuine disaster of the 2019 election. I was and remain agnostic about Corbyn himself, believing him to be temperamentally unsuited to the role of party leader. What his leadership represented, however, was something entirely different: a genuine belief in the capacities and capabilities of ordinary people, to which millions of voters responded in kind. If that’s a disaster, I don’t know what success is.Lynsey HanleyLiverpool While I agree with Will Hutton on the need for a swift transition to renewables, having spent the last 20 years working as an engineer in the space sector, I have my doubts that beaming microwave solar power to Earth from space can ever be part of the solution (“Warmed-up Thatcherism was never going to be the answer. Now it would be a disaster”, Comment). Can you imagine the planning process? How does “Residents object to plans for death ray from the skies” sound as a headline in the local paper? And that’s before we get to energy security: what exactly will we do when a hostile power’s satellite “accidentally” collides with our orbiting power station, and how to fix it when it goes wrong? But what is most frustrating is the unchallenged techno-utopianism underpinning much of the talk of net zero. We are constantly grasping for the next shiny toy, betting the farm (and our children’s futures) on the off-chance that yet more marginal gains and elaborate schemes will keep pace with our ever-growing appetites. Where in all this is the discussion of reducing demand, or an honest appraisal of how to live sustainably on a single planet with finite resources too much for us to face?Kevin MiddletonStanford in the Vale, Faringdon, Berkshire It is astonishing to see the chair of the social mobility commission, Katharine Birbalsingh, claim “it all starts with smartphones” (“Take away children’s phones to boost social mobility”, News). The past decade has seen the devastation of Sure Start children’s centres, a squeeze on education spending that has hit the most disadvantaged areas hardest, and steep cuts to social security benefits that have increased child poverty. Each of these factors will have damaged social mobility. Focusing on smartphones falls into a long tradition of blaming individual behaviour to distract attention from deep structural inequalities. The commission is supposed to hold government to account on its actions. It is not hard to see why Birbalsingh was the government’s choice as chair.Dr Kitty StewartAssociate professor, Department of Social Policy, Associate Director, Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion, London School of Economics and Political Science, London WC2 Hans Kundnani’s article makes the crucial distinction between Vladimir Putin and the Russian people (“First, we did too little to oppose Russia. Now do we risk going too far the other way?”, Comment). We must not make the mistake a second time of failing to respect and work with the Russian people after Putin’s inevitable fall. The “west” – including particularly the United States – erred the first time by failing to support Mikhail Gorbachev and thus enabling him to achieve a far more gentle and constructive breakup of the Soviet Union. The cataclysmic implosion it suffered fatally destroyed Gorbachev’s credibility and contributed significantly to the estrangement of Russia from the west. Disastrously, the United States, abetted by other western governments, encouraged exploitative capitalism to feed off the fall of the Soviet Union and it was this that produced the oligarchs who quickly grasped the sale of state assets. The collapse of the rouble in 1998 was the final straw, not least as it caused increased poverty among millions of Russians. They blamed Gorbachev and his successor Boris Yeltsin and, instead of following democracy, they looked for a strong nationalist leader – and there was Putin waiting in the wings. Putin is very much the collateral damage of the west’s mistakes. The Russian people rightly have great pride in their culture, much of which in its music, its opera, its ballet and even its literature, is European. We must constantly make the point that we also recognise Russian culture and draw Russia after Putin into a closer relationship.Michael MeadowcroftLeeds Your news article states that “Russians over 65 are 51% more likely to watch television than under-25s” (“Moscow’s family divide”). This still leaves 49% of over-65s who aren’t more likely to watch television, and not all of the 51% are swallowing the propaganda. Russian blogger Ilya Krasilshchik’s 110,000 followers does not constitute a major proportional ratio of a vast country to endorse the impression in your article that older Russians are pro-war in the Ukraine.

3/20/2022,"Fair play, sanctity of contract and respect for human dignity are principles deeply embedded in British culture. P&O Ferries’ summary sacking of 800 workers in a pre-recorded Teams message so they could be replaced within hours by agency workers at allegedly half the cost offended all three. It was a callousness from which even 19th-century mill owners and ship owners shrank. Conservative ministers, given to see each principle through employers’ eyes as expendable if the circumstances so require, were roused to share the widespread outrage. The archbishop of Canterbury caught the public mood when he described the act as “inhumane and unethical”. Both the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, wrote to the company accusing it of outrageous behaviour, offering the government no time to organise remedial action – managing to correct their originally wrongly addressed letter to P&O’s now departed chair with unusual alacrity. The mistake betrayed the distance between government and business that is part of the problem. Meanwhile, the case has been referred to the Insolvency Service to see if any law has been broken. If so, warns Kwarteng, the company could face an unlimited fine. This is not a case where ministers can take the side of the company, even one anxious to limit losses it says run at £100m a year. However, P&O, a subsidiary of Dubai’s DP World, will have taken care to see that it remained on the right side of Britain’s feather-light employment law, an international byword for laxity, wholesale bias to employers and legendarily weak enforcement. It justified what it did as a last resort, having effectively bypassed trade unions and bought out the employees’ consultation rights with a package at least as attractive as what they could achieve in a tribunal. Obeying the rule of law is thus recast as a business cost: if the rate of return is higher by buying out fundamental statutory obligations, then for an international company careless of its reputation it is an investment well worth making. Nonetheless, one of Britain’s leading employment law experts, Bristol University’sProf Alan Bogg, identifies two areas where the company may have transgressed the law. The dismissals are most likely unfair under the dismissal legislation, and consultation rights over collective redundancies are sure to have been breached by these peremptory actions. However, the process of government lawyers coming to a judgment, possibly imposing a fine and then fighting the inevitable appeal will take months, if not years, as P&O will have calculated. The risk of a swingeing fine, unlikely even in this case, given the notorious laxities of employment law enforcement, will have been priced into P&O’s decision. By the time the issue is settled, it will be trading with its new agency staff – and those sacked on Thursday will be living with the consequences. Brexiters argued that Brussels’ insistence on offering a modicum of worker rights throttled business. The claim was always arrant nonsense but the government promised a new employment act to exploit the alleged “opportunities of Brexit”, to codify the law around minimalist principles to remove any trace of dark anti-British values such as offering workers’ rights, entitlements and dignity at work. Those were for the sclerotic EU. The bill is stalled, the government not daring to strip British workers of the remaining legacy of European rights, even though it did block a private members’ bill aimed at ending the egregious practice of firing and rehiring the same workers on lower wages and worse entitlements. Anti-trade union attitudes are deeply ingrained, but further weakening of employment law is now politically much more difficult. The proposed creation of a single enforcement body – perhaps even properly resourced – might finally be brought forward. There might (and should) also be clauses more closely aligning British and European law over collective redundancies and consultation, so that cynical employers cannot exploit differences. There is also an urgent need to consider stricter penalties and remedies to prevent fundamental rights being treated as business costs. Britain should be setting a gold standard in such regulation – not leading the race to the bottom. P&O’s trading problems, like those of swathes of UK-based businesses, were a direct result of plummeting trade with the EU post Brexit, in its case, collapsing freight volumes on its ferries. Negotiating participation in the single market, however off-limits the proposition may currently be to Britain’s political class, and aligning our employment law to the EU’s where necessary, would do much to restore trade flows, underpin real wages and promote decent behaviour in the workplace. Capitalism does not have to be like this. DP World professes a commitment to best corporate governance and responsible capitalism, but its refusal to abide by its promises has already triggered the resignation of one non-executive director, Mark Russell. British company law, like employment law, is phenomenally lax. As an international ferry operator, P&O provides a key public service. It should be allowed to trade in Britain only if it incorporates as a company consecrated to delivering public benefit, to be held to account by its shareholders and stakeholders for so doing. The government could do more than wring its hands over the bad name P&O has given to capitalism. It could act to change the current dynamic for the benefit of all.

3/20/2022,"Ukraine has been an independent country for more than half Vladimir Putin’s adult life (he turns 70 this year). It’s been a free republic for more than 30 years, long enough for the first generation of Ukrainians born since independence to have school-age children of their own. It’s had seven different leaders, all of them still alive. It would be sentimental – and patronising – to talk about a country having “grown up”. But 30 years is long enough for countries to change, for better or for worse; long enough for countries to have eras. Ukraine was well into its second era, its European era, when Putin invaded last month. Putin never accepted the right of post-Soviet Ukraine to exist in independent Ukraine’s first era. In terms of understanding the country, that’s the period he’s stuck in; Putin doesn’t acknowledge that a second era began. The west shares many of the Kremlin’s misapprehensions about Ukraine. We are still too ready to see the country through the cliche of a “nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking” west and a “Russia-friendly, Russian-speaking” south and east. Or, more crudely and colourfully, neo-communist miners in the east, neo-Nazis in the west. Of course it was never that simple, even in post-Soviet Ukraine. But European-era Ukraine, which emerged in 2014, overturned its own political fundamentals. Faced with an existential struggle against a powerful, ruthless neighbour, Russia, where nationalism now serves autocracy, an emergent class of Ukrainian liberals made common cause with Ukrainian nationalists. It’s been an uncomfortable alliance but it has kept the country together. As Ukraine defends itself against Putin’s terror campaign, mutually estranged liberals and nationalists in other countries – the US, England, France – would do well to watch. To talk about “European Ukraine” isn’t to describe an achieved state but a state of hope: hope of membership in the European Union – more meaningful to Ukraine, at least until Russia attacked, than membership of Nato. Ukraine’s hope of Europe had its material side, a hope of grants, jobs and trade. Since the “revolution of dignity” – also known as “Maidan” – in 2014, trade with the EU soared while trade with Russia plunged. More than a million Ukrainians went to work, legally or otherwise, in the EU. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, much has been made in Britain of the EU’s openness to Ukrainian refugees compared with the barriers put up by London. But it’s a depressing reflection of how mainstream anti-immigrant assumptions have become in the UK that virtually no one in Britain is aware the EU gave Ukrainians visa-free access years ago, as a reward for their country’s sacrifices in Europe’s name. Since 2017, as a result of that and of Brexit, Ukrainians have levelled up and Britons levelled down to identical rights of EU entry: 90 days’ stay without a visa. Beyond the material hopes of European-era Ukraine, there is the prospect, less tangible and more powerful, of an alternative form of nationhood. Rather than the archaic, romantic, racial mystifications of old Ukrainian nationalism, or Putin’s neo-imperial vision of Ukraine pulverised and remade as a puppet state to serve Russian nationalism, it’s of Ukraine pursuing its free course as an equal member of a self-constraining, self-governing association of countries, the EU. The beauty of the EU, for Ukraine, is the capaciousness of its model for both liberals and nationalists. In some ways, the aims of European-era Ukraine closely resemble those of the Scottish National party and the Irish republic: to use the economic power of the EU to leverage their own, to break out of the orbit of a delusional post-imperial culture, to find national self-determination by accepting multinational rules. As Tom Nairn wrote of Scotland, a country could aspire to “a new interdependence where our nationhood will count, rather than towards mere isolation”. For Ukraine’s more conservative nationalists, it’s Poland and Hungary that offer the more appealing EU models – stridently patriotic, subordinating media, courts and education to national ideals and social conservatism, all while getting subsidies and trading freely within the EU. The prelude to Ukraine’s European era occurred in 2013 under president Viktor Yanukovych, a profoundly corrupt politician from the east of the country. Although seen as a proxy for Kremlin interests, and generally loyal to the idea of post-Soviet Ukraine as a Russian client state, he threw his weight behind an association agreement with the EU. He had his country on side, but Putin gave it to be understood that he considered it a betrayal – Ukraine could partner with the EU or Russia, not both. Whether Yanukovych was genuinely up for the deal with Brussels, or simply angling for a bigger bung from Moscow, he changed his mind at the last minute, took a large loan from Putin and turned his back on the EU. It was November. Protests began in Kyiv against abandonment of the EU deal. There were calls for Yanukovych to resign. Small, peaceful protests were put down violently by the police. Parliament, then controlled by Yanukovych allies, passed repressive laws against free speech and gatherings. As 2013 passed into 2014, the protests grew, their demands expanded and their base spread. Opposition to Yanukovych and calls for deeper ties to Europe evolved into attacks on the entire corrupt, oligarchic system of business and government. Young members of the liberal intelligentsia were joined by radical nationalist groups, by small-business owners and by factory workers. Opposition MPs aligned themselves with the protesters. Increasingly violent street battles were waged around Kyiv’s central square, Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Barricades went up. Weapons escalated from clubs and stones and shields to molotov cocktails, to stun grenades and rubber bullets, to actual bullets. Some police were shot; more than 100 protesters were killed. In the third week of February, for reasons still mysterious – perhaps because the security forces ceased to believe in the president – the regime collapsed. European foreign ministers brokered a peace deal with Yanukovych, the Maidan crowd refused to accept it, and Yanukovych fled the country. Parliament voted in an interim government and prepared for new elections. Barely had the revolutionaries’ victory sunk in before Russia annexed Crimea in a nearly bloodless coup de main. In Yanukovych’s home region of Donbas, on the border with Russia, locals angry at the treatment of their lawfully elected president seized administrative buildings. They were quickly ousted, only to be replaced, in April, by a new wave of rebels helped by volunteers from Russia. Fighting escalated to a full-scale war, culminating in incursions by regular Russian troops. Thousands of people were killed. By 2015, the front lines had stabilised and fighting lessened, with part of Donbas under joint Russian-rebel control. The rest of Ukraine was at peace. In 2017, the association agreement with the EU came into force. Even before the war in the Donbas began, there were warnings of what the longer term held. In what reads now as an astonishingly accurate forecast of what was to come, in an interview with a Ukrainian paper in March 2014, the former Putin adviser Andrei Illarionov spelled it out, failing only to predict that eight years would pass first. “There’s an aim and a plan to attack Ukraine which was put together years ago,” he said. It has many different elements … Crimea, the south-east and, of course, a change of power in Kyiv. And then there are other things: a new [Ukrainian] constitution, to be written in the Kremlin, disarmament of the Ukrainian people, liquidation of Maidan, and so on.” “Liquidation of Maidan” sounds different from the current Kremlin programme, until you realise this is simply “denazification” by another name. It might seem trivial now, when Ukraine is on fire and hundreds are being killed every day, when all that seems important is how many Russian tanks and planes and soldiers the Ukrainians have to blow up to make Putin stop, to talk about abstractions like nationalism and liberalism. And yet without these forces coming together over the past seven years of semi-peace, would Ukraine have held out this long? I remember being surprised, when I visited Kyiv at the end of February 2014, to see how focused liberals and nationalists alike were on a European future. The spokesman for one of the most notorious radical nationalist groups, Right Sector, talked to me about Poland as a model for the country. European flags were everywhere. I went for dinner one evening with a friend of a friend, a successful businesswoman. The Maidan was very localised; a huge encampment of brown tents crowded together, wreathed in the smoke of hundreds of stoves, in which exhausted people, who had fought nightly battles in freezing conditions, lived difficult lives away from home. But right next door to it were expensive restaurants with waiters in spotless white shirts serving fine wines and tuna carpaccio. “You know, the nationalists were very important,” said the businesswoman, sipping her grenache. “They did very good work at the leading edge.” I’ve always been in two minds about that conversation with someone who had been very kind to me. On the one hand, it had that air of somebody being grateful that somebody else was doing their dirty work; that one person had education, good taste and proper gentle sentiments, and they were grateful that their interests were being protected by another person who risked their life with a petrol bomb and a brick, and whose most conservative, chauvinist views the first person would definitely not want to hear at their dinner table in peacetime. On the other hand, my friend’s friend was being honest about the realities of a dangerous situation, and resistance towards a nasty, increasingly repressive regime: that she was not one of nature’s fighters, and she was glad to have people prepared to fight for their country on her side. “Nationalist” and “liberal”, after all, are words with an extremely broad range of meanings. “For me, ‘national’ is what allows me to defend Ukraine as an independent, sovereign nation,” said the Ukrainian philosopher Evhen Bistritsky in 2018, at a time when disillusionment with Ukraine’s post-Maidan failures to get to grips with corruption and institutional inertia was running deep. “I am a liberal, defending the independence of Ukraine. Part of Ukrainian society supports conservative values, linking them to security. If we’re really only going to preach universal, classical, liberal values … we promote discord in the country.” In a country not fighting for its existence, in the US, perhaps, or Britain, or France, in some safe part of the EU, such language would have marked Bistritsky out as a centrist, a moderate, even, more pejoratively, an undemocratic compromiser. In the present Ukrainian context, faced with the Russian killing machine, “discord” becomes “failure to fill the ranks”. Recently the Ukrainian writer Artem Chekh published Absolute Zero, his memoir of service in the Ukrainian army on the Donbas front in 2015. In it he faces up to the strangeness of being a liberal, cosmopolitan, intellectual man serving alongside workers and farmers who see the world in patriotic, if cynical, absolutes. I went around to his flat in Kyiv a few weeks ago for coffee and cake. Now he has taken up a gun again to protect the city against the invader. In an article for the London Review of Books blog, he lists his comrades: “a music producer, an owner of a household chemicals store, a teacher, an artist, a bank clerk, a former investigator, a doctor. The ability to write, paint, act, play a musical instrument or dance doesn’t matter now. What counts is military experience.”",News/World news,The power of the new Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/the-power-of-the-new-ukraine-liberals-nationalists-common-cause

3/20/2022,"Authorities in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol have said Russian troops have forcibly deported several thousand residents to Russia, as claims emerged that the besieged city had been “wiped off the face of the earth”. “Over the past week, several thousand Mariupol residents were deported on to the Russian territory,” the city council said in a statement on its Telegram channel late on Saturday. “The occupiers illegally took people from the Livoberezhniy district and from the shelter in the sports club building, where more than a thousand people (mostly women and children) were hiding from the constant bombing.” The claims have not been independently verified, but the council’s statement is one of several reports about Mariupol residents being taken to Russia, where authorities have referred to “refugees” arriving from the strategic port. In a Saturday night broadcast, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said of the attacks on Mariupol: “To do this to a peaceful city ... is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come.” Intense street fighting in the city has hampered attempts to free hundreds of survivors trapped for days inside a bombed theatre as Ukrainian forces held out against a larger Russian force inside the strategically important southern port city. Jakob Kern, the World Food Programme’s emergency coordinator, described Russia’s tactic of preventing emergency food supplies to Mariupol as “unacceptable in the 21st century”. Ukrainian MP Dmytro Gurin described conditions in the city as “medieval”. Across Ukraine, evacuations from cities continued on Saturday along eight of 10 humanitarian corridors, said the deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk. A total of 6,623 people were evacuated, including 4,128 from Mariupol, the scene of some of the war’s worst suffering. Meanwhile, China has responded angrily to mounting western pressure to condemn the invasion, saying it stands on the right side of history over the crisis and is in line with the stances of most countries. “China will never accept any external coercion or pressure, and opposes any unfounded accusations and suspicious against China,” the foreign minister, Wang Yi, said on Saturday evening. China has refused to condemn Russia’s action in Ukraine or call it an invasion, although it has expressed concern about the crisis. Beijing has also opposed economic sanctions on Russia over Ukraine, describing them as unilateral and not authorised by the UN security council. Wang’s comments came after the US president, Joe Biden, warned his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Friday of “consequences” if Beijing gave material support to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “We have always stood for maintaining peace and opposing war,” Wang said, reiterating that China will make independent judgments. “China’s position is objective and fair, and is in line with the wishes of most countries. Time will prove that China’s claims are on the right side of history.” An official in Mariupol accused Russian forces of taking thousands of Ukrainians across the border into Russia, adding he feared they could be used as forced labour, the New York Times reported. Pyotr Andryushchenko, an assistant to the city’s mayor, said Russian forces had taken “between 4,000 and 4,500 Mariupol residents forcibly across the border to Taganrog” – a city in south-western Russia – the newspaper said. The residents had been taken without their passports, Andryushchenko said. A Ukrainian police officer in Mariupol warned that it had been “wiped off the face of the earth”, and pleaded with the US and France to supply the country with a modern air defence system. In a video appeal from a street strewn with rubble, Michail Vershnin publicly reminded Biden and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that they had promised assistance “but what we have received is not quite it”, and urged them to save the civilian population. “Children, elderly people are dying. The city is destroyed and it has been wiped off the face of the earth,” Vershnin said, speaking in Russian in the video filmed on Friday that has been authenticated by the Associated Press. He then appealed directly to the US and French leaders. “You have promised that there will be help, give us that help. Biden, Macron, you are great leaders. Be them to the end.” Pressure on China to abandon its neutral stance on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine increased after the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, urged leaders in Beijing to get off the fence and join global condemnation of the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin. “As time goes on and as the number of Russian atrocities mounts up, I think it becomes steadily more difficult and politically embarrassing for people either actively or passively to condone Putin’s invasion,” Johnson said. “There are considerable dilemmas now for people who thought they could sit this one out, who thought they could sit on the fence. And, yes, I think that in Beijing you are starting to see some second thoughts.” China, however, has shown no sign of altering its stance. On Saturday its vice foreign minister, Le Yucheng, described western sanctions against Russia as increasingly “outrageous”. Le also acknowledged Moscow’s position on Nato, saying the alliance should not further expand eastwards and force a nuclear power like Russia “into a corner”. “The sanctions against Russia are getting more and more outrageous,” Le said at security forum in Beijing, adding that Russian citizens were being deprived of overseas assets “for no reason”. “History has proven time and again that sanctions cannot solve problems. Sanctions will only harm ordinary people, impact the economic and financial system ... and worsen the global economy.” The fall of Mariupol, a key connection to the Black Sea, would mark a major advance for the Russians, who are largely bogged down outside major cities more than three weeks into the biggest land invasion in Europe since the second world war. Russian media have offered a very different explanation for the reported removal of Mariupol residents. The Tass news agency reported on Saturday that 13 buses were moving to Russia, carrying more than 350 people, about 50 of whom were to be sent by rail to the Yaroslavl region and the rest to temporary transition centres in Taganrog, a port city in Russia’s Rostov region. RIA Novosti agency, citing emergency services, reported last week that nearly 300,000 people, including some 60,000 children, had arrived in Russia from the Luhansk and Donbas regions, including from Mariupol, in recent weeks. Russia’s defence ministry said this month that more than 2.6 million people in Ukraine have asked to be evacuated – a claim that has not been independently verified.",News/World news,Ukraine crisis: claims Mariupol women and children forcibly sent to Russia ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/ukraine-crisis-claims-mariupol-women-and-children-forcibly-sent-to-russia
