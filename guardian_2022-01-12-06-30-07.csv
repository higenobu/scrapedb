1/12/2022,"Aston Villa are close to completing the signing of Lucas Digne from Everton, who have inquired about taking Anwar El Ghazi on loan for the rest of the season. Digne has attracted interest from several Premier League clubs since his fall out with Rafael Benítez, including Newcastle and Chelsea, but the France international had no interest in joining Eddie Howe’s relegation-threatened side and the European champions have not made a firm bid for the left-back.  Villa, however, have emerged as a more attractive proposition for the 28-year-old and negotiations have advanced in recent days. Everton had been seeking around £25m for the defender, who they signed for £18m from Barcelona in 2018, although have now registered interest in Villa winger El Ghazi. The Netherlands winger has found his game-time limited under both Dean Smith and Steven Gerrard this season and has made only four Premier League starts. Villa value the 26-year-old at £15m but Everton would prefer a loan deal for the former Ajax and Lille player. El Ghazi would become Everton’s third signing of the January window should a move proceed. The club has spent an initial £29m on two full-backs, Vitalii Mykolenko and Nathan Patterson, and Benítez remains keen on strengthening his options in central midfield. The Everton manager accused Digne of putting his own interests before those of the team in a stinging attack last week and has not selected him since the derby defeat by Liverpool on 1 December. One deal Villa have secured is that of Philippe Coutinho. The Brazilian midfielder joins the club on loan for the rest of the season having successfully obtained a work permit and reunites with Gerrard, who he played alongside at Liverpool. “It’s a pleasure to be here; it’s a great club,” said Coutinho. “I spoke a lot with the manager, with Stevie, and he told me about the club and his ambitions. I’m very happy to be here and I’m looking to enjoy my football. “I’ve known Stevie for a long time. I played with him and I learned a lot from him. He’s someone who I have big admiration for. I hope to do my best here. For sure, I will work hard, and I hope together we can do good work.” Coutinho could be handed his Villa debut against Manchester United on Saturday. “I’m looking forward to meeting the fans, to being on the pitch,” the 29-year-old added. “I know and I feel that they’re happy that I’m here.”",Sport/Football,Aston Villa close to completing signing of Lucas Digne from Everton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/11/aston-villa-close-to-completing-signing-of-lucas-digne-from-everton
1/12/2022,"A surgeon who burned his initials on to the livers of two patients during transplant surgery has been struck off the medical register. Simon Bramhall, 57, admitted using an argon beam – used to stop livers bleeding during operations and to highlight an area to be worked on – to sign “SB” into his patients’ organs in 2013 while working at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth hospital.  In 2018, the liver, spleen and pancreas surgeon was given a 12-month community order and fined £10,000 after admitting to two counts of assault by beating. On Tuesday, a review by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) concluded Bramhall’s actions were “borne out of a degree of professional arrogance” and that they “undermined” public trust in the medical profession. Bramhall, of Tarrington, Herefordshire, was first suspended from his post as a consultant surgeon in 2013 after another surgeon spotted the initials during follow-up surgery on one of his patients. A photograph of the 4cm-high branding was taken on a mobile phone. During his sentencing hearing in 2018, Bramhall was told one of the victims suffered serious psychological harm as a result of the branding. The surgeon later told police he branded the organs to relieve operating theatre tensions following difficult and long transplant operations. Bramhall tendered his resignation at the Birmingham hospital in 2014 amid an internal disciplinary investigation into his conduct. In December 2020, Bramhall was suspended from the profession for at least five months. A report from the latest tribunal said a review hearing on 4 June found his fitness to practise was no longer impaired and the suspension order was revoked. The report said the General Medical Council (GMC) also appealed against the suspension decision and a high court judge quashed the sanction, with the matter then resubmitted to MPTS for its consideration. In its determination, the tribunal concluded a suspension order would be “insufficient to protect the wider public interest” and said erasure from the medical register would be an “appropriate and proportionate sanction”. It said: “The physical assault of two vulnerable patients whilst unconscious in a clinical setting, one of whom experienced significant and enduring emotional harm, seriously undermines patients’ and the public’s trust and confidence in the medical profession and inevitably brings the profession as a whole into disrepute.” The conclusion continued: “The tribunal rejected the submission made on behalf of Mr Bramhall, that it was to relieve tension. It was an act borne out of a degree of professional arrogance.”",News/Society,Liver-branding transplant surgeon struck off medical register,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/11/liver-branding-transplant-surgeon-struck-off-medical-register

1/12/2022,"Boris Johnson is facing intense pressure from senior Conservatives to publicly confess he attended a rule-breaking garden party in Downing Street, with the Scottish Tory leader suggesting the prime minister should resign if he broke Covid rules. A string of Conservative MPs openly expressed anger and humiliation about the “bring your own booze” gathering for up to 40 people on 20 May 2020 after it emerged in a leaked email. Others called on him to come clean and apologise on Wednesday in the hope of stemming rising fury.  Johnson has declined to say whether he and his then fiancee, Carrie Symonds, attended the event. About 100 Downing Street staff were invited by Martin Reynolds, Johnson’s principal private secretary, to “make the most of the lovely weather”. The former minister Johnny Mercer described the revelations as “humiliating”, while the MP for Keighley, Robbie Moore, said: “The email from Martin Reynolds infuriates me. I have no idea what these people were thinking.” Caroline Nokes, another former minister, said: “I have no words that can adequately express how angry I am at the ‘don’t do as I do, do as I say’ attitude that appears to have prevailed in Downing Street.” Mark Harper, the chair of the influential Covid Recovery Group, said: “These are serious allegations. The prime minister will be in the House of Commons [on Wednesday] … and I await his explanation with interest.” Privately, more Tory MPs said they were waiting for Johnson’s explanation at prime minister’s questions. “He should fess up, take responsibility personally, and apologise – not one of these pretend apologies but a proper apology,” said one. Another said: “It’s so disgusting. I just feel I have been lied to. I just think the whole operation is a liability.” They added that Tory MPs were exchanging angry messages on WhatsApp about how reluctant they are to expend political capital defending Johnson. A third former minister warned: “None of this is yet irretrievable, but this is another notch on the dial: we’re moving up the scale from retrievable to irretrievable.” Douglas Ross, the leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, told STV he was “furious” that while other Britons were banned from seeing dying or hospitalised relatives, “people in 10 Downing Street were enjoying the sunshine out the back of No 10 and quaffing the booze”. Ross said he could no longer back the prime minister if he was found to have attended the event and then failed to stand down. “I would not in any way support the prime minister if he broke the law and attended that party,” he said. Ross suggested the controversy could prompt more Conservative MPs to send letters to Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee, in a concerted bid to trigger a vote of no confidence. “These are discussions I know that colleagues will be having in Westminster,” he said. If Brady receives 54 such letters, a vote of no confidence will be triggered – and if Johnson were to lose that vote, a leadership contest would be launched in which he would not be allowed to stand. Senior Conservatives said that the mood in the House of Commons tea room on Tuesday was “funereal”, with MPs discussing who would replace Johnson. One MP said that Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, could be prime minister within months. “It is no longer a question of if the PM will go, it is when,” the MP said. Prof Stephen Reicher, of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours, which advises the government, warned that the continuing row over parties risked undermining key public health guidance. “It is a massive distraction. With all attention on parties, the government cannot do its job of communicating clearly about the pandemic and what should be done about it. Second, it polarises and politicises the debate about the pandemic and so undermines the sense of community which is critical in securing adherence,” he said. The latest Tory backlash was sparked by a leaked email from Reynolds that invited colleagues to “socially distanced drinks” after “an incredibly busy period”. At the time, two people from different households – but no more – were permitted to meet outdoors in a public place at a distance of 2 metres, under England’s pandemic rules. The junior minister Michael Ellis was sent out by Downing Street to parry MPs’ questions at an angry and emotional session in the House of Commons on Tuesday. The DUP MP Jim Shannon broke down in tears as he said his mother-in-law had died alone during lockdown, urging the government to ensure “full and complete disclosure” of what happened. Ellis apologised “for the upset that these allegations have caused”. He confirmed that an inquiry by a senior civil servant, Sue Gray, would consider Downing Street gatherings on 15 and 20 May 2020 as well as the following Christmas, but sidestepped further questions. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is expected to accuse the prime minister of misleading parliament about the gatherings when he faces him across the dispatch box on Wednesday. When news broke of a No 10 Christmas party in 2020, Johnson told MPs: “All guidance was followed completely.” A few days later, when a video emerged of his former press secretary Allegra Stratton joking about a party, he said he was sickened and furious. Ellis told MPs that Gray’s report would “establish the facts, and if wrongdoing is established, there will be requisite disciplinary action taken”. Asked whether Johnson would resign if he was found to have broken the law, Ellis said the prime minister was “going nowhere” and “retains the confidence of the people in this country”. Senior Tory MPs called for Johnson to carry out a radical shake-up of the No 10 machine in the wake of the shock defeat in the North Shropshire byelection last month, but no changes have so far been announced. A snap survey by pollsters Savanta ComRes found that two-thirds of the public think Johnson should resign after the latest revelations. Even among Conservative voters, the figure was 42%. One Johnson loyalist said: “It would be the honourable, statesmanlike thing to at least say, ‘Look, I screwed up.’ He could do something about this. And the trouble is, he keeps leaving us all high and dry.” They added: “It’s really going tits up for him.”",News/Politics,Furious Tories pile pressure on Boris Johnson over No 10 parties,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/11/conservatives-anger-pressure-boris-johnson-no-10-parties-pmqs
1/12/2022,"Quebec has announced plans to impose a “health tax” on residents who refuse to get the Covid-19 vaccination for non-medical reasons, as a new wave of the coronavirus pandemic overwhelms the province. Premier François Legault announced the new “contribution” for the unvaccinated on Tuesday, as the province reported 62 new deaths, bringing the total number of people killed by Covid-19 in the province to 12,028 – the most in Canada.  “A health contribution will be charged to all adults that don’t want to get vaccinated. We are there now,” he said. “Those who refuse to get the shot bring a financial burden to hospital staff and Quebecers. The 10% of the population can’t burden the 90%.” The move follows the abrupt resignation of a senior health official in the province, amid mounting anger over new lockdown measures, hospitals at capacity and the slow rollout of vaccine boosters. Quebec made headlines last week when it announced that customers in cannabis shops and liquor stores would need proof of vaccination, leading to a surge in new bookings. But while other provinces have accelerated the rollout of booster shots to fight the contagious Omicron variant, Quebec has only recently opened access to residents 40 years of age and above. In Ontario, residents over 18 have been able to access the booster since mid-December. News of the tax, the first of its kind in the country, comes less than a day after the province’s public health director tendered his resignation. Dr Horacio Arruda served in the role for 12 years and was reappointed to another three-year term in June 2020, but has faced mounting criticism in recent weeks. “Recent comments about the credibility of our opinions and our scientific rigour are undoubtedly causing some erosion of public support,” wrote Arruda in his resignation. Arruda faced particular condemnation for allowing care home staff to move between sites during the first wave of the pandemic. That decision played a key role in helping the virus spread unchecked and contributed to more than 4,000 deaths – many of them among seniors. Most recently, Arruda was faulted for his dismissal of the benefits of N95 masks, saying they were not necessary for teachers or healthcare workers. Quebec’s worker safety board disagreed and recently ordered healthcare workers be provided with the more effective masks. As the Omicron variant sweeps across the province, prompting new lockdown measures and a government-ordered curfew – the only one in the country – Quebecers have been forced to reckon with the fact that their province appears to once again be the among the worst-hit regions of the country. “I’m not going to mince words: things are bad right now when it comes to hospitalizations,” said Dr Donald Vinh an infectious disease specialist at McGill University’s health centre. “Every time there’s a ceiling, in terms of hospital capacity, the hospitalization rate breaks through that ceiling.” The province’s health minister estimated last week that at least 20,000 healthcare workers due to Covid-19 infections 50,000 are on leave for burnout. Quebec’s timing during the pandemic has often been unlucky: the first wave hit as families travelled during a school break, bringing home the virus when they returned. But more than two years later, the province still struggles in executing its plan to fight the virus. It eschewed access to rapid tests and has since cut off access to PCR tests due to overwhelming demand. On Tuesday, 600,000 boxes of rapid tests are set to be distributed to Quebec amid growing frustration from residents that the tools needed to combat the pandemic are unavailable. The government has sent mixed messages by imposing a curfew – but also slowly rolling out booster vaccines, said Vinh. Hospital intakes keep rising and there is little indication the province has reached its peak. Despite early hopes Quebec might experience a similar rapid rise and drop to South Africa, Vinh calls those hopes “foolishly naive” and that a new approach is needed. “The virus is going to continue to propagate here until we get it under control,” he said. “And wishful thinking isn’t how we’re going to fight it.”",News/World news,Quebec plans to impose a ‘health contribution’ tax on the unvaccinated ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/quebec-health-tax-unvaccinated-coronavirus
1/12/2022,"Barcelona signed two for one. First came Ferran Torres, the footballer they wanted, joining for €55m plus €10m more in add-ons. Then came Samuel Umtiti, the footballer they didn’t and still don’t but whom they needed so that Torres could actually play. Registered now and recovered from Covid, the former Manchester City forward’s first game is set to be a clásico, if not on the most classic stage. At the third attempt, the King Fahd Stadium in Riyadh gets to host the game they paid for. On Monday morning, less than two hours before Barcelona boarded the plane to Saudi Arabia for the Spanish Super Cup and a semi-final meeting with Real Madrid, the club announced that Umtiti had extended his contract, which will end in 2026 instead of 2023. The cliche talks about a player being tied to the club, which is rarely true anyway, and this is the other way round. There was no celebration and no pretence that this was anything other than another problem postponed, a long-term commitment that is a short-term fix.  Barcelona had long been trying to get rid of Umtiti, who has problems with a knee, a salary they can’t afford (commensurate with his status as a World Cup winner) and no place in the team. No goodwill from the fans either, although perhaps that will change now. The 28-year-old defender has played once this season and almost certainly won’t play in Saudi Arabia, although he was on the plane. Few clubs wanted him and nor was he keen to depart, at least not yet. Forcing him out had been considered but ruled out. But no one anticipated that they would extend the contract of a player they don’t want. This was no change of heart, no re-evaluation of his usefulness and it certainly doesn’t change the fact that they would like him to go sooner rather than later. They hadn’t concluded that, if he wasn’t going to go, maybe he could be useful after all. Well, not on the pitch, anyway: off it, it had turned out he was not just useful, he was necessary, a means to an end. Barcelona didn’t even wait two minutes between announcing his deal and explaining why they had done it, which wasn’t about him. Quote tweeting the renewal, they said: “Through this contract extension FC Barcelona will be able to increase its ‘financial fair play’ quota and thus register Ferran Torres.” And there it was in a nutshell. In all probability there are promises made and details that escape us, agreements reached and not revealed which help explain why the terms were accepted. But the way Barcelona explained it, essentially Umtiti had done them a favour: he had agreed to a short-term 10% pay-cut and to spread the salary he was due to receive between now and 2023 across the next three years to 2026. An imaginative way to overcome an inherited problem which was constructed by Mateu Alemany, the director of football; one that may not resolve the underlying financial difficulties but does allow Barcelona to overcome an immediate obstacle. Torres’s signing was facilitated by a loan from Goldman Sachs. That was one thing; registering him was another. For any registration to go through, clubs must work within “salary limits”, essentially La Liga’s version of financial fair play. An automated system, if you don’t comply it simply will not allow the player to be registered. Barcelona’s limit this season is €97.7m. Their actual salary mass is closer to €430m. Which means they can only spend by what’s known as the 4:1 rule: they must make and demonstrate a four-euro saving for every euro they invest. (Or a two-euro saving if they are able to offload a player who alone accounts for 5% of the limit.) Alemany had already said that before anyone could arrive, players had to leave. Last week Barcelona’s president, Joan Laporta, declared: “We’re back!” – which was very like him. It was premature too, of course. Yet they are trying to get back and if the inheritance limits them, if more problems await, if significant gaps remain in the squad and players they don’t want remain too, there are some reasons to be cheerful. Not least an emerging young generation: Pedri and Ansu Fati are fit again and flew to Saudi Arabia. They have Gavi, Nico, Ronald Araújo, Eric García. Torres fits that mould too, a strategic signing that was also a statement. The Athletic attacking midfielder Raúl García has criticised the decision to host the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia. His club face Atlético Madrid there in Thursday's semi-final after Real Madrid take on Barcelona on Wednesday. ""It doesn't make a lot of sense,"" the 35-year-old said. ""It's very simple: we are playing a tournament that is [normally] played in our own country and it doesn't make sense to play it anywhere else. Football has changed: no one thinks about the fans. What matters is generating [money], getting sponsors, and we are forgetting the basics, what football is. The atmosphere, families enjoying games together, kick-off times that suit spectators. It's changed a lot since I started playing. I'm old [school] in this.""  Plans run in parallel: short, medium and long term. Ultra short term, too. This latest, left-field announcement is the perfect example of that, an imperfect solution but a solution of sorts. “The reality is that when we signed Ferran we knew that we didn’t have any margin with the salary limit,” Alemany said. “We made an exception with Ferran because it was worth it. We accept that and we’re working on various avenues to register him.” Even the long, long-awaited departure of Philippe Coutinho was not enough – there was no sale and Barcelona are paying about 45% of his salary. Ousmane Dembélé’s renewal, structured to create margin, remains on hold and may not happen. Sergi Roberto’s future has not been resolved. And so that avenue unexpectedly became Umtiti. On Monday, recently renewed, Umiti was on the plane bound for the Spanish Super Cup and a meeting with Real Madrid, but that wasn’t what mattered; what mattered was that Torres was on board with him.",Sport/Football,Are Barcelona back?
