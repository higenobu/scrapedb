4/5/2022,"An Alabama man is accused of beating a man to death with a shovel in what prosecutors say was a murder possibly motivated by race. Morgan Barnhill, 27, called police on Tuesday to report a supposed burglary at his Tillman’s Corner home in Mobile, Alabama, according to CBS affiliate WKRG 5 News. At that point, he told authorities he beat the unknown intruder in the head. The supposed intruder was later identified as Etienne Murray, 25, who succumbed to his injuries on Friday. “Upon arrival, officers discovered [Barnhill had] observed an unknown male subject attempting to enter the shed,” police initially stated. “The victim confronted the subject and struck him with a shovel on his head.” But authorities now say that Barnhill did, in fact, know the victim and that the burglary claims were all a lie. “Through the investigation, it was determined that the alleged victim (Barnhill) intentionally misled officers about an attempted burglary on the 4300 block of Windy Hill Circle East,” authorities stated in the updated release. Detectives allegedly found “several inconsistencies” in Barnhill’s statement. Murray’s mother, Linda Gayle, told Mobile, Alabama Fox affiliate WALA that Barnhill and Murray had been friends — and that Barnhill had invited Murray over for a barbecue before confronting him about a missing purse. During a bond hearing on Monday, prosecutors said that Barnhill beat Murray with a shovel and a pipe, according to WKRG. They also said that Barnhill, who is white, was motivated by the belief that Murray, who is Black, had stolen from him, and that race might have been a factor in the attack. Barnhill then allegedly left Murray’s body for hours before finally calling the police. Graphic photos of the victim in his hospital bed were published by WALA when he was still fighting for his life. “After he beat by baby, he left him there, didn’t call for help, didn’t try to help,” Murray’s mother, Linda Gayle, told the outlet. “If he would’ve called for help, maybe my baby would still be alive.” Barnhill allegedly eventually confessed to falsifying the report of a burglary, WKRG reported.  Morgan Barnhill  Photo: Mobile Police Department  He was booked into the Mobile County Metro Jail on charges of murder on Saturday, according to jail records. Requests to Mobile County District Attorney’s Office were not returned to Oxygen.com. “I want him to know he shattered my world,” Gayle told WALA. “He took my baby, and he didn’t have to do that. If he feels like my child took something from him, why not call the police? Why not handle it the right way? Why take the cowardly way out and beat my child’s head and leave him there?” Morgan Barnhill’s bond has been set at $500,000. It was unclear from jail records when he was scheduled to appear in court next. The Mobile Police Department said they are not releasing any further details at this time.",U.S./Oxygen,Alabama Man Accused Of Beating Man To Death With Shovel Might Have Been Motivated By Race,https://news.yahoo.com/alabama-man-accused-beating-man-214209121.html
4/5/2022,"Russian forces on Tuesday reportedly struck a tank of nitric acid in Ukraine’s Luhansk region, sparking panicked warnings for residents to protect their faces and remain indoors. Serhiy Gaidai, the head of the Luhansk regional administration, issued a video address warning residents the toxic fumes can cause “severe damage.” “Prepare protective face masks soaked in soda solution. When applied locally to the eyes, nitric acid causes severe damage with extensive necrosis of the cornea and conjunctiva, leading to loss of vision,” he said, urging those living near Rubizhne to remain indoors and seal up their windows. “This chemical is very toxic and we don’t know where the toxic cloud will go. We will be monitoring the air and waiting for rain,” he said. The alarming warning came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky prepared to address the United Nations Security Council on mounting evidence of Russian war crimes against Ukraine. In comments to Ukrainian media, Zelensky vowed that Ukrainian authorities would create an “internal mechanism” to track down the Russian soldiers accused of committing war crimes against Ukrainian civilians, much like Israel’s Mossad hunted down Nazi fugitives across the globe. “We will definitely deal with this,” he said, adding that “lists will be compiled” of all those Russians accused of executing and torturing Ukrainian civilians. “There are people who really want to find these criminals,” he said. “Prosecutors of various nations will deal with all of these crimes… They see a great deal of evidence. And, unfortunately, the evidence will only keep coming—there will not be any less. There is still Izyum ahead, and many places where there is still no access [for Ukrainian authorities]—the occupied Melitopol, Berdyansk—we have no idea what happened there,” he said. His comments came as the scale of Russian atrocities in the town of Bucha, a Kyiv suburb, left the world reeling, with hundreds of innocent residents found slain in the streets, some with signs of torture. Newly released satellite footage from the now-liberated town showed that the bodies of slaughtered civilians had littered the streets for weeks before Ukrainian forces reclaimed the territory from Russia, debunking Moscow’s shameless claim that Putin’s troops didn’t kill “a single civilian” there and that it must have been Ukrainian forces. Russia’s Defense Ministry has claimed the executions were “staged” by Ukrainian psy-ops specialists, a claim that was echoed in a full-blown propaganda campaign on Russian state TV that said Western intelligence services were behind the killings. In the face of those Russian denials on Tuesday, Ukrainian media released aerial video that purportedly captures Russian troops in Bucha firing directly at a man who was simply riding past them on a bicycle. Ukrainian journalist Dmytro Komarov also shared footage from Bucha showing the aftermath of Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian evacuees. He said at least three vehicles of civilians were found shot up along an evacuation route, including a bus with a young couple inside and a vehicle where an elderly couple were slain.

4/5/2022,"DAKAR (Reuters) - Malian troops and suspected Russian mercenaries allegedly executed around 300 civilian men over five days during a military operation in a central town, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a report on Tuesday. The killings took place between March 27 and 31 in Moura, a rural town of around 10,000 inhabitants in the Mopti region, a hotspot of jihadist activity that has intensified and spread to neighbouring countries in the Sahel region. ""The incident is the worst single atrocity reported in Mali's decade-long armed conflict,"" HRW said. The reported executions sparked condemnation from the United States, the European Union, France and Germany, who have all called on the Malian government to allow for an independent investigation. The West African country's army on Saturday said it had killed more than 200 Islamist militants in the operation in Moura after it received information about a meeting between rebel groups. It added that it would investigate any allegations of rights abuses. A Mali military spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report by New York-based HRW. Nineteen witnesses told the rights group that Malian and Russian-speaking soldiers arrived by helicopter and exchanged two rounds of gunfire with Islamist fighters, during which rebels, soldiers and a few civilians were killed. The troops then deployed through the town, summarily executed several men then gathered hundreds of unarmed others from their homes and took them to the bank of a nearby river, the witnesses told HRW. Many were traders from surrounding villages who came to attend the town's weekly livestock market. Some were infiltrated militants, the witnesses told HRW. The men were held for five days under the sun and arbitrarily selected for execution by gunfire during the night. Bodies were piled into three mass graves, HRW said. The operation allegedly involved over 100 Russian-speaking men, according to multiple security sources who spoke to HRW. Several witnesses also described white soldiers speaking an unfamiliar foreign language they believed to be Russian. One trader said he was drinking tea with his two brothers while waiting for the market to start when he heard shooting. ""Seven Russians approached, gesturing for us to get up. There were no Malian soldiers with them. They searched us and the house, then took us east of the village, near the river, where we found another 100 men,"" he told HRW. ""Another group of Russians pointed at my brothers and another man. I thought they were going for interrogation. They took them several metres away and executed them, point blank,"" he said. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the witnesses' accounts. Mali's transitional government, which took power in a 2020 military coup, is battling the insurgency with the help of private military contractors belonging to Russia's Wagner Group. Both Mali and Russia have previously said they are not mercenaries but trainers helping local troops with equipment bought from Russia.

4/5/2022,"Ecologists with the U.S. Geological Survey collected first-of-its-kind photographic evidence last year of a bobcat devouring python eggs in the Big Cypress National Preserve. Driving the news: The finding, published last month in the journal Ecology and Evolution, suggests there's finally hope that a predator could halt the python's creeping dominance — by eating its eggs. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free What they're saying: ""This is the first documentation of any animal in Florida preying on python eggs, and the first evidence or description of such antagonistic interactions at a python nest,"" the authors wrote. Why it matters: Tens of thousands of invasive Burmese pythons are spread over more than 1,000 square miles of South Florida and compete with native wildlife for food, causing severe population declines in Everglades National Park and Big Cypress. Raccoons, opossums and bobcats have greatly declined since 1997. Marsh rabbits, cottontail rabbits and foxes effectively disappeared. What happened: Ecologists trained a camera trap on a python nest to observe reproductive biology, but the camera caught a bobcat arriving to snack. The cat came back three times that night, then returned the next morning to bury extra eggs in the ground. The next day the camera caught the cat and snake in a fight. Yes, but: It's possible that this interaction was an isolated incident. Though it could also be possible that native species are beginning to respond to the presence of the python, and this could be a learned behavior that starts to happen regularly, the New York Times reports.
