3/23/2022,"Midfielder Franck Kessié will join Barcelona on a free transfer this summer after agreeing a four-year contract with the La Liga club. The Ivorian, whose contract at Milan is set to expire at the end of the season, had already reached a verbal agreement with Barça in the last week. Kessié has now signed a deal with Xavi’s side until June 2026, and will receive a net annual salary of €6.5m (£5.4m), not including bonuses. Kessié, who joined Milan from Atalanta on an initial loan deal in 2017 and has made more than 200 appearances for the current Serie A leaders, has also completed his medical and is expected to be announced as a Barça player imminently. Barcelona are working on other transfer targets for the summer, with the Leeds winger Raphinha one name on their shortlist. There have been no discussions with the Premier League club about a transfer, but talks have been held with the player’s agent, Deco. The former Barcelona and Chelsea midfielder is close to Barça’s president, Joan Laporta. Raphinha, who missed Leeds’ win at Wolves on Friday after testing positive for Covid-19, is thought to be happy with the prospect of moving to the Camp Nou.",Sport/Football,Franck Kessié to join Barcelona from Milan this summer on free transfer,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/22/franck-kessie-barcelona-milan-raphinha-transfer-news
3/23/2022,"A completely locked-in patient is able to type out words and short sentences to his family, including what he would like to eat, after being implanted with a device that enables him to control a keyboard with his mind. The findings, published in Nature Communications, overturn previous assumptions about the communicative abilities of people who have lost all voluntary muscle control, including movement of the eyes or mouth, as well as giving a unique insight into what it’s like to be in a “locked in” state. Locked-in syndrome – also known as pseudocoma - is a rare condition, where people are conscious and can see, hear, and smell, but are unable to move or speak due to complete paralysis of their voluntary muscles, eg as a result of the progressive neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Some can communicate by blinking or moving their eyes, but those with completely locked-in syndrome (CLIS) cannot even control their eye muscles. In 2017, doctors at the University of Tübingen in Germany enabled three patients with CLIS to answer “yes” or “no” to questions by detecting telltale patterns in their brain activity, using a technology called functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The advance generated widespread media coverage, and prompted the parents of the current patient, who was diagnosed with ALS in 2015, to write to the medical team, saying he was losing the ability to communicate with his eye movements, and could they help. The problem with using fNIRS to help CLIS patients to communicate is that it is relatively slow, and only gives the correct answer 70% of the time, meaning questions have to be repeated to get a reliable answer. “It was always our goal to enable a patient in a completely locked down state to spell out words, but with a classification accuracy of 70%, it is almost impossible to enable free spelling,” said Dr Ujwal Chaudhary, a biomedical engineer and managing director of ALS Voice gGmbH in Mössingen, Germany, who co-led the research. Instead, they suggested surgically implanting two microelectrode arrays, each 3.2mm square, into the part of the man’s brain involved in planning and controlling voluntary movements. Because he still had control of his eye movements, he was able to consent to the procedure, although he has been completely locked in since late 2018. Working with the researchers, the man learned how to generate brain activity that could alter the frequency of a sound wave, via a computer programme. He then applied this same strategy to control a spelling program, which allows him to select letters one at a time to form words and phrases at an average rate of about one character per minute. Slow as that may be, “if you have a choice of no communication, and a communication of one character per minute, the choice is very obvious,” Chaudhary said. Among his communications, the 36-year-old from Germany, has requested goulash soup and beer – despite being fed through a tube that bypasses his mouth and taste buds – and asked if his four-year-old son would like to watch a Disney film with him. He has also asked his mother for a head massage, and on one day told his family: “My biggest wish is a new bed and that tomorrow I come with you for barbecue.” Such sentences provide some insight into the man’s quality of life. “If someone is forming sentences like this, I would say it is positive. Even if it is not positive, it is not negative,” Chaudhary said. “One time when I was there, he said, ‘thank you for everything, sister’ [to his sister, who helps care for him]. It was an emotional moment.” The research also answers a long-standing question about whether people with CLIS also lose the ability of their brain to generate commands for communication, said co-author Dr Jonas Zimmermann, a senior neuroscientist at the Wyss Center in Geneva, Switzerland. “Successful communication has previously been demonstrated with brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in individuals with paralysis. But, to our knowledge, ours is the first study to achieve communication by someone who has no remaining voluntary movement and hence for whom the BCI is now the sole means of communication.” Chaudhary hopes to further develop the technology, to enable words to be spelled out faster, and to create a dictionary of common words or sentences for patients to choose between – although further studies are needed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the approach.",News/Science,‘Emotional moment’: locked-in’ patient communicates with family via implant,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/22/emotional-moment-locked-in-patient-communicates-with-family-via-implant
3/23/2022,"Wildfires will pose a greater socioeconomic risk in years to come, scientists have predicted, as they increasingly burn agricultural areas and harm populations. A study uses machine learning to model where wildfires are likely to strike in coming years, and their impact on humanity. The researchers, from universities including Peking University, Beijing and Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US, hope their study can be used to show regional disparities in wildfire exposure to help prepare for fires in those areas. They used 13 Earth system models which simulate the atmosphere, the ocean, sea, ice, the land surface and the vegetation on land and the biogeochemistry of the ocean, and also show the movement of carbon through the Earth system. While the models showed a smaller increase of carbon released by wildfires, the socioeconomic factors had a greater increase. This, the researchers said, is because: “Such elevated socioeconomic risks are primarily caused by the compound regional enhancement of future wildfire activity and socioeconomic development in the western and central African countries, necessitating an emergent strategic preparedness to wildfires in these countries.” As countries in western and central Africa develop, wildfires are more likely to hit residential and agricultural areas. During the 2019–2020 Australian bushfire season, a series of major wildfires burned large areas, costing more than US$20bn, and killing at least 33 people. These types of impacts are likely to become more common. The researchers found many areas which are likely to face a “more flammable future”, including the Congo, which under their modelling faces a higher leaf area index – meaning there will be more fuel to burn – and populated areas in the US which could face catastrophic impacts like those seen in Australia. “For the populated western and north-eastern coasts and the Appalachian Mountains of the US, as well as northern and eastern Australia, our observational constraint confirms the previously projected more flammable future from fuel drying under climate change, suggesting an increased likelihood of the 2019–2020 Australian bushfire and 2020 extreme western US wildfire seasons in the upcoming decades,” the researchers said. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.",News/World news,"Wildfires will pose great socioeconomic risk in future, say researchers",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/wildfires-will-pose-great-socioeconomic-risk-in-future-say-researchers
3/23/2022,"P&O Ferries sacked 800 workers last week, replacing them with agency staff. One anonymous seafarer working the Irish Sea ferry route for many years describes the impact of abruptly losing his job and way of life. When you speak to ferry passengers they’re sometimes quite surprised you actually live on board the ship. It’s more than just a workplace. With your shipmates you’re living, eating, working together, doing all the domestic stuff like watching television, you’re the police, ambulance and fire brigade – you’re self-sufficient. So when P&O-hired security boarded our ship, it wasn’t just a sacking. It was an eviction. I’ve worked on the Irish Sea crossing from Scotland to Northern Ireland for many years, and been at sea since I was 17. It’s intensive work. It’s a non-stop operation, so we work 12-hour shifts for two weeks at a time. Then you have two weeks off. But it’s not leave, it’s rest. You’re shattered. The noise and the vibrations of the ship mean sleep is a lot more unsettled, especially when you get bad weather. The trip before the sacking we got three storms in a row. It can get rough. On Thursday, it was around 6.30am, when the ship was unloading the freight, that we got an order not to load it up for the normal 8am crossing. Then there was word other ships across the UK had been ordered to stand down too. This felt serious. I’d been up for hours and was exhausted. But me and the other guys were desperate to know. I was full of nervous energy. The captain was instructed by superiors in Dover to allow security guards to enter the port and board the ship. We saw them arriving like a funeral procession, these five cars coming into port and driving slowly towards the ship. One man read a prepared statement: “You’re dismissed.” We were escorted one by one to our cabins. There were two guards with me as I packed up years and years worth of gear. I wasn’t even allowed to say goodbye to the crew, which becomes like your family. It was disgusting, brutal, shocking. We were just escorted to a shuttle bus. I went home to my daughter, dazed and astonished. When you’ve worked on the same ship for many years like I had, there’s a pride and a wealth of knowledge that builds up. Pride in your ship. As a crew you learn these little tricks of the trade: how the water supply, sewage systems, engines work. Now all that knowledge is gone. I’m worried we’ll be dealing with this for years. Competitors are going to be fighting against this low-cost model. As soon as one company goes for fully cheap agency labour, the others will have to follow. How could you do this to a person? How can anyone plan their life when they’re living each two-week contract at a time? We’re becoming a society of those with job security and those without. I go through waves of anger. I wish I could rewind the clock. Sitting on land, the feeling is just disbelief. I’ve written a CV for the first time in years. My ship and cabin are still sitting there, but now they’re occupied by an agency worker. It’s so painful to be cast off in this way.",News/Business,"‘It wasn’t just a sacking, it was an eviction’: a P&O seafarer tells his story",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/22/it-wasnt-just-a-sacking-it-was-an-eviction-a-po-seafarer-tells-his-story
3/23/2022,"An alleged Islamic terrorist feigned an interest in churches and Christianity before killing the MP David Amess, a court has heard. Ali Harbi Ali, 26, denies the murder of the Southend West MP during a constituency surgery in a Methodist church in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex on 15 October last year. A jury at his Old Bailey trial heard that Ali posed as a Christian who was about to move into the area in order secure a meeting with Amess. At the meeting he stabbed Sir David 21 times and waved before he was stopped by unarmed police officers, jurors were told. On Tuesday, the prosecutor, Tom Little QC, took the jury through a timeline of events leading up to the 69-year-old Tory MP’s death. Little said that on 27 September, Ali, whom the jury heard was a trained radiographer, emailed Amess’s office to ask about a meeting. He wrote: “I will be moving to the area from a Labour-held constituency and wanted to get to know my future MP. Since I work in healthcare, I would like to know his plans, if any, for the hospital and workers. He added: “Also, as someone interested in Christianity, I have seen many churches in my area losing attendances and struggle with upkeep, eventually becoming at risk of being demolished or repurposed. I wanted to know if the situation in Southend is similar and, if so, what are the solutions.” Ali concluded the email by saying: “Looking forward to seeing you soon. If all appointments are taken, let me know if there’s a cancellation. I’ll be in the local area and will be able to drop by.” Amess’s assistant, Rebecca Hayton, responded to Ali’s emails by requesting his address and full name to check he was a constituent. After he emailed a Southend postcode he was given an appointment on 15 October. Confirming the appointment, he said he would be brief. He emailed: “I don’t really know how long the appointments are but I don’t think I’ll take too long.” On Monday, Little had told the jury that Ali was a “fanatical radicalised Islamist terrorist” who stabbed Amess in the neck after seeing an Islamic State video on how to carry out a stabbing attack. On Tuesday, the court heard that police pieced together Ali activities before the alleged attack from hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and data from his laptop and mobile phone. The jury was told that Ali had looked up a webpage about Amess on 22 July last year and three hours later he was near the Houses of Parliament. His web history also showed searches last September relating to the housing minister Michael Gove, the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and the London MP Mike Freer, jurors heard. The jury was shown CCTV footage of Ali travelling by train from his Kentish Town home in north London to Leigh-on-Sea, wearing a long khaki jacket, a black backpack slung over his right shoulder, blue trainers and black trousers. Around the time of the alleged attack, Ali sent a message to family and friend that appeared to have been drafted days before, the court was told. In it, he said the attack was “for the sake of Allah”, jurors heard. He allegedly wrote: “I apologise to my family for deceiving them for so long. I would have preferred hijrah so as not to harm you, but I could not. The obligations upon me to take revenge for the blood of Muslims were too great. The shame of abiding in the very lands that carry out these horrendous acts against my brothers and sisters was too much.” Ali then spent 14 minutes on the phone to his sister, ending the call when he was confronted and arrested by two plainclothes police officers arriving at the scene.The trial continues.",News/UK news,"Terror suspect posed as Christian before killing MP David Amess, court told",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/22/terror-suspect-posed-as-christian-before-killing-mp-david-amess-court-told
