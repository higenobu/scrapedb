2/1/2022,"An employee in Florida who negotiated his work schedule around going to church was fired after he failed to show up for a Sunday shift, according to court documents. Now the company owes him $50,000. Tampa Bay Delivery Service LLC, an Amazon delivery partner out of Florida, agreed to settle allegations of religious discrimination after the former worker filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The EEOC, which is tasked with enforcing federal anti-discrimination laws in the workplace, launched a lawsuit on his behalf last year. Under the terms of the agreement, which a federal judge approved on Jan. 27, Tampa Bay Delivery Service denied any wrongdoing but agreed to provide better training to managers and dispatchers as well as hire a religious accommodation coordinator. “We commend Tampa Bay Delivery Service for working collaboratively with EEOC to resolve this lawsuit,” Robert E. Weisberg, regional attorney for the EEOC Miami District, said in a news release. “The company’s willingness to address EEOC’s concerns will help in preventing future employees from being forced to choose between employment and a religious belief.” A representative and lawyers for Tampa Bay Delivery Service did not immediately respond to McClatchy News’ request for comment on Monday, Jan. 31. According to the EEOC’s complaint, Tampa Bay Delivery service hired the man in May 2019 as a delivery driver. He reportedly told the company during the hiring process that he could not work on Sundays because he is a Christian and attends church on Sundays. The owner agreed — if the man agreed to work on Saturdays, according to the lawsuit. About four months later, Tampa Bay Delivery Service scheduled the employee to work a Sunday shift, the EEOC said. He told them that he could not work that day and went to church instead. The company fired him later that same day, the complaint states. The former employee filed a charge of religious discrimination with the EEOC shortly thereafter, and the agency determined there was reasonable grounds to believe Tampa Bay Delivery Service had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Its attempts to resolve the matter outside of court fell short, and the EEOC filed a complaint in the Middle District of Florida on Sept. 29. The parties filed a proposed consent decree around the same time, which the judge didn’t approve until last week, court documents show. Under the two-and-a-half-year agreement, Tampa Bay Delivery Service will pay the former worker $25,000 in back pay and $25,000 in compensatory damages. The company also agreed to: Designate someone as the “Religious Accommodations Decision maker” who will decide all requests for religious accommodations from employees Create an anti-religious discrimination policy Post a public notice about the EEOC’s allegations and resulting settlement Provide 90 minutes of in-person training on religious discrimination to all managers and supervisors Furnish a written report to the EEOC every six months for the duration of the decree Another ‘After-School Satan Club’ is approved, this time at an Ohio elementary school ‘Punched in the gut’: Jewish couple was denied adoption due to religion, lawsuit says Evangelist radio host Dave Ramsey fired worker who wanted COVID precautions, suit says Greyhound accused of discriminating against Muslim bus driver.

2/1/2022,"One of the women on President Biden's short list to replace outgoing Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer once startled the court's justices with her aggressive position against the plaintiff in a religious liberty case. Leondra Kruger, now a justice on California's highest court, argued on behalf of the Obama administration in Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, which involved whether religious organizations had to abide by anti-discrimination laws when choosing religious leaders. 13 SENATE DEMOCRATS VOTED AGAINST BLACK FEMALE JUDGE NOMINATED BY TRUMP ""The position that Kruger staked out as a litigant in Hosanna-Tabor against the ministerial exception — one that even Justice Kagan described as ‘amazing' during oral argument — suggests that she could be hostile to religious liberty if she were appointed,"" Judicial Crisis Network president Carrie Severino told Fox News Digital in a Monday statement. ""Given that Hosanna-Tabor was unanimously decided, such a position would shift the Court's liberal wing even further to the left, which of course is the desire of the liberal dark money groups who spent $1.5 billion in 2020 to help elect President Biden and Senate Democrats,"" she continued. Kruger broadly argued against a doctrine known as the ""ministerial exception,"" which generally bars the government from intruding into how religious organizations choose their leaders. The ministerial exception is what protects religious groups' ""freedom to make employment decisions based on their beliefs, including their beliefs on marriage and human sexuality,"" for ministerial positions, notes the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group. The justice's ruling recognized that ""it is impermissible for the government to contradict a church’s determination of who can act as its ministers."" In his opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the Obama administration’s argument was ""hard to square with the text of the First Amendment itself, which gives special solicitude to the rights of religious organizations."" ""We cannot accept the remarkable view that the Religion Clauses have nothing to say about a religious organization’s freedom to select its own ministers,"" he opined. During oral arguments, Roberts pressed Kruger on whether there is ""a ministerial exception distinct from the right of association under the First Amendment."" ""We think that the ministerial exception is one that incorporates the right of association as well as the rights under the religion clauses,"" Kruger responded. ""Is there anything special about the fact that the people involved in this case are part of a religious organization?"" Roberts retorted. Kruger said her team thought the Court ""has elaborated in other cases involving similar claims to autonomy, noninterference"" but was interrupted by Roberts. ""Is that a ‘no?’ You say it’s similar to other cases. Expressive associations — a group of people who are interested in labor rights have expressive associations,"" Roberts asked. ""Is the issue we are talking about here in the view of the United States any different than any other group of people who get together for an expressive right?"" Kruger said her side believed ""the basic contours of the inquiry are not different"" before repeating her point about similar cases, eliciting a response from several justices. ""That’s extraordinary… We’re talking here about the Free Exercise Clause and about the Establishment Clause, and you say they have no special application to –,"" the late Justice Antonin Scalia said, with Kruger finishing his sentence. ""The contours — but the inquiry that the Court has set out as to expressive associations we think translate quite well to analyzing the claim that Petitioner has made here. And for this reason, we don’t think that the job duties of a particular religious employee in an organization are relevant to the inquiry…."" Kruger said. ""So, this is to go back to Justice Scalia’s question, because I too find that amazing, that you think that the Free — neither the Free Exercise Clause nor the Establishment Clause has anything to say about a church’s relationship with its own employees,"" Justice Elena Kagan said.",U.S./Fox News,"Leondra Kruger, potential Biden Supreme Court nominee, stunned justices with position on religious liberty",https://news.yahoo.com/leondra-kruger-potential-biden-supreme-192718027.html

2/1/2022,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — The family of a Kansas woman charged with joining the Islamic State group and leading an all-female battalion says they want nothing to do with her, a prosecutor said Monday. Allison Ekren, 42, made an initial appearance on Monday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Alexandria. The hearing lasted only minutes; she was ordered to remain in jail pending a detention hearing set for Thursday afternoon, and an attorney was appointed to represent her. At the end of the hearing, though, First Assistant U.S. Attorney Raj Parekh told the judge that he had been in contact with Ekren's parents and her adult children, and all had said they wanted no contact with her. The magistrate judge, Ivan Davis, said he had little ability to keep her from reaching out to her family from jail, but told Ekren he would take it into account at Thursday's hearing if she contacted her family against their wishes. Ekren, speaking in a soft-spoken voice and wearing an inmate jumpsuit and headscarf, said she understood the restriction. She also told the judge, in response to his question, that she preferred to be addressed as Ekren. The Justice Department used her full name, Allison Fluke-Ekren, when it announced charges against her Saturday. Prosecutors say Ekren wanted to recruit operatives to attack a college campus in the U.S. and discussed the idea of attacking a shopping mall. She told one witness that “she considered any attack that did not kill a large number of individuals to be a waste of resources,” according to an FBI affidavit. The affidavit also alleges Ekren became leader of an Islamic State unit called “Khatiba Nusaybah” in the Syrian city of Raqqa in late 2016. The all-female unit was trained in the use of AK-47 rifles, grenades and suicide belts. According to court papers, Ekren moved to Egypt in 2008 and traveled frequently between Egypt and the U.S. over the next three years. She has not been in the U.S. since 2011. Prosecutors believe she moved to Syria around 2012. Ekren's newly appointed attorney, Joseph King, declined comment after Monday's hearing.",U.S./Associated Press,Family wants no contact with woman facing terrorism charge,https://news.yahoo.com/family-wants-no-contact-woman-195449403.html
2/1/2022,"The F-15EX Eagle II recently fired an air-to-air missile over the Gulf of Mexico. The missile's release marked a major milestone for the jet, as it was the first time a weapon was fired from this aircraft. The Air Force plans to replace the aging F-15 fighters with the new Eagle II jets. The US Air force's newest fighter, the F-15EX Eagle II, recently achieved a significant milestone – it fired off a weapon for the first time. The fighter, which is assigned to the 40th Flight Test Squadron, let loose an AIM-120D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile in pursuit of a BQM-167 target drone while flying over the Gulf of Mexico on January 25. The missile release during the Combat Archer air-to-air weapons system evaluation program marked the first time a weapon has been fired from this type of fighter aircraft and comes after over six months of developmental and operational flight testing, the 96th Test Wing said in a statement on the shot. The shot was also the first live-fire shot for experimental test pilot Maj. Benjamin Naumann, who flew with Maj. Mark Smith. Naumann said the shot was ""another important step towards fielding the aircraft to combat units."" Colton Myers, a F-15EX test project manager with the Operational Flight Program Combined Test Force, said that the missile release ""was an end-to-end verification of the entire weapons system, which will pave the way for more complex missile shots in the future."" The Eagle II gets its name from the F-15 Eagle and the F-15E Strike Eagle that came before it. The F-15 Eagle is an exceptional fighter aircraft built for air dominance, but as of last April, when the F-15EX Eagle II was officially rolled out and given its name, 75% of the fleet was past its service life and 10% were grounded because of structural issues, the Air Force revealed. The Air Force initially ordered eight Eagle II jets and plans to eventually acquire at least 144 to replace the aging fleet of F-15C/Ds, the average age of which is over 40 years old. The Eagle II is a two-seat aircraft, but it can be flown by a single pilot. It features fly-by-wire controls, advanced avionics, and digital cockpit displays. It also has the capacity to carry up to 30,000 pounds of air-to-air missiles and air-to-ground munitions. Lieutenant General Mike Loh said at the plane's unveiling ceremony last April that the new jet's capabilities will provide ""significant"" improvements over legacy aircraft, like an ""upgrade in weapons capacity, including the ability to carry outsize weapons for these missions, and for standoff roles in the high-end fight supporting our geographic Combatant Commanders.""
