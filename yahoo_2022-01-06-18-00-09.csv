1/6/2022,"Convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been ordered by prosecutors to return a $1,400 COVID relief payment he received last summer along with other money he has received, according to a court filing Wednesday. The money should instead be used as restitution to his victims, the filing said. Tsarnaev has $3,885.06 in his inmate trust account, with the money received from the government, the Office of Federal Defenders of New York and from private citizens. He spent several thousand on his siblings for ""gifts"" ""support"" and ""books"" but has barely paid any of the more than $101 million owed to the victims or the $3,000 special assessment as part of his sentencing, the court filing said. SUPREME COURT OT HEAR ORAL ARGUMENTS IN DOJ APPEAL TO REINSTATE TSARNAEV DEATH SENTENCE The inmate, who was sentenced to death two years after the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, which left three people dead and hundreds hurt, has paid only $2,202.03 in restitution so far. The death sentence was overturned in 2020 after a court ruled that a trial judge erred by excluding some evidence. An appeal to reinstate his death sentence is currently before the U.S. Supreme Court. He is allowed to use money for clothes and books and other items that can help him in prison but the rest should go toward victim payments, prosecutors said. ""By Congressional mandate, the United States has a statutory duty to collect restitution owed to crime victims,"" prosecutors said in the document, citing a lien placed on Tsarnaev's property, including his trust account, after his conviction. ""The United States submits that the requested relief is reasonable and appropriate in this instance, especially in light of the Defendant prioritizing payments to his siblings over the victims of his crimes,"" the filing said. It wasn’t explained how Tsarnaev received a COVID relief payment. Authorities say Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, planted bombs near the marathon's finish line, resulting in deaths and injuries when the bombs exploded. The brother later died in a shootout with police during a manhunt.

1/6/2022,"Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday vowed to hold accountable anyone who was involved in the deadly U.S. Capitol riot “at any level.” John Dean, the one-time counsel to Richard Nixon who later flipped on the then-president over the Watergate scandal, saw that as a warning to former President Donald Trump and his allies. “Donald Trump and his co-conspirators should not sleep well!” Dean tweeted. ""... at any level..."" Attorney General Merrick Garland on who will be held responsible for attacks on democracy. Donald Trump and his co-conspirators should not sleep well! — John W. Dean (@JohnWDean) January 5, 2022 Garland, amid criticism the Department of Justice is yet to target organizers of the riot and has focused on the Trump supporters who entered the Capitol, promised “the actions we have taken thus far will not be our last.” “The Justice Department remains committed to holding all January six perpetrators at any level, accountable under law, whether they were present that day, or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” he said. “We will follow the facts wherever they lead.” More than 700 people have been charged over the attack, 300 of those with felonies, said Garland. “We build investigations by laying a foundation. We resolve more straightforward cases first because they provide the evidentiary foundation for more complex cases,” he explained. “Investigating the more overt crimes generates linkages to less overt ones. Overt actors and the evidence they provide can lead us to others who may also have been involved and that evidence can serve as a foundation for further investigative leads and techniques.” “Those involved must be held accountable. And there is no higher priority for us at the Department of Justice,” he added. Watch Garland’s comments here: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated. GOP Rep.
