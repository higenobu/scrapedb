2/10/2022,"A job applicant shared a mortifying flub on TikTok after discovering she had been recording herself complaining about the company in a video interview segment that could not be retaped. In the video, Chaylene Martinez, the job applicant in question, is seen on the phone with a male friend, discussing one of SkyWest Airlines’ video interview questions, unaware that she had already begun recording her only take. “The question is the stupidest, cheesiest question I’ve ever read in my life,” Martinez, who was applying to be a flight attendant with the regional airline, says on the call. “What is your impression of SkyWest company culture, and how does that resonate with you?” She continues to spitball ideas about the company’s mission statement, saying to her friend, “I can’t word this properly… and you have to record yourself saying it, so it’s so awkward.” Eventually, Martinez looks back at her computer screen to discover that she was recording her entire private phone call through the company’s interview portal and was not able to redo it. “I’m so sorry,” says a shocked Martinez. “I didn’t realize it was recording. I was practicing. So I was going to say, ‘Sorry.'” “Doing a video interview that you only get once chance to get right … accidentally started recording too early,” Martinez’s on-screen caption reads. The video has been viewed over 7 million times since posting on Jan. 27. The awkward but relatable interview moment sent TikTokers into a frenzy. “The ‘sorry’ when she knew it was just too far gone,” one user commented. “I work for SkyWest, and this made its way to the SkyWest [Facebook] page, and let me just tell you every comment is all of us saying, ‘PLEASE hire her,'” wrote a flight attendant named Abrienne, who seems to work for the company. “I think she should still get the job!” wrote another TikTok user. Martinez later shared a follow-up video where she expressed embarrassment that her viral video inadvertently let her current colleagues know she is searching for another job. In the comments, Martinez confirmed that SkyWest ghosted her after her botched interview. Worry not, Chaylene. When it comes to other jobs, there are plenty of planes in the sky. Er — fish in the sea, that is. Martinez did not immediately return In The Know’s request for comment.

2/10/2022,"By Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber BEIJING (Reuters) - Russian media reported on Wednesday that 15-year-old figure skater Kamila Valieva had tested positive for a banned drug, after the ceremony to present her and her team mates with their Olympic gold medals was postponed for unexplained legal reasons. Newspapers RBC and Kommersant named the drug as Trimetazidine, which is typically used to treat chest pain. The news broke late at night in Beijing, where Valieva was part of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) ensemble that won the figure skating team event on Monday ahead of the United States and Japan. Reuters attempted to reach the ROC chef de mission for comment but his phone was not answering. The ROC earlier declined to comment on reports that Valieva had returned a positive test. The teenager delivered one of the highlights of the Beijing Games so far when she landed the first quadruple jumps by a woman in Olympic competition. She was one of four ROC skaters who did not appear at their practice sessions on Wednesday. Figure skating is a prestige sport for Russia, in which it has an outstanding record at Olympic and world championships. Any move to penalise Valieva or strip the team of their medals would likely cause a national outcry. Prominent journalist Vasily Konov, deputy general producer at Russian sports channel Match-TV, said without citing sources that the sample in question had been taken two months ago. ""The drug trimetazidine does not help an athlete in any way. At all. It was found in one single sample in December. A minuscule amount. Nothing in her samples before or since,"" he wrote on social media. ""There is no doping in the conventional sense. No! This cardiac drug has no impact on ... performance. Now leave Kamila in peace."" Former Russian pairs skater Tatiana Volosozhar, who won two gold medals at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, showed solidarity with Valieva on social media, calling for the use of the Russian hashtag #Iwillneverbelieve to send the teenager support. Her post was ""liked"" on Instagram by Valieva herself. BANNED LIST Trimetazidine, or TMZ, works by increasing blood flow to the heart and limiting rapid swings in blood pressure. The drug is not approved for use in the United States. It has been on the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) list of prohibited substances since 2014. Dr. Sadiya Khan, a cardiologist and assistant professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said in theory such a drug might be used in a healthy person to enhance blood flow above and beyond normal levels. ""The idea behind it would be potentially if you enhance blood flow, you could improve somebody's ability to exercise longer or exercise more efficiently by allowing the heart to respond super-normally,"" Khan said in a telephone interview. But using any medication in a way for which it is not intended could have negative side effects, even if those risks are not known. ""I think it could be very dangerous,"" she said. The other caveat, she said, is that it is not clear that it offers any performance-enhancing benefit. ""There's a theroetical benefit,"" she said. ""There's no strong evidence that it does make a difference."" LEGAL ISSUE The case is further complicated by the fact that Valieva is only 15. According to WADA's world anti-doping code, athletes who commit doping violations should be publicly named, but this is not required if the person concerned is a minor under the age of 18. In that case, according to rule 14.3.7, any optional public disclosure ""shall be proportionate to the facts and circumstances of the case"". Earlier on Wednesday, the International Olympic Committee said a need for ""legal consultation"" had forced the postponement of the medal ceremony for the figure skating team event won by the Russians. ""You can bet your bottom dollar we are doing everything that this situation can be resolved as soon as possible. I cannot give you any more details but we will do our utmost,"" IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said. The IOC, International Skating Union and the international agency in charge of drugs testing during the Games all declined to comment on media reports that the delay was caused by a positive drug test. The Russian Sports Ministry said it was premature to comment on media reports about the reason for the postponement. Russia has acknowledged some shortcomings in its implementation of anti-doping rules but denies running a state-sponsored doping programme. Its athletes are competing at the Beijing Games without their flag and national anthem, because of sanctions against Russia for previous violations.

2/10/2022,"The post Dave Chappelle Helps Nix Affordable Housing Plan in Ohio Village appeared first on Consequence. On Monday (February 7th), the council for the village of Yellow Springs in Ohio decided not to move forward with the affordable housing component of a new development due in large part to the concerns of its most famous resident: Dave Chappelle. As reported by Dayton Daily News, the comedian spoke up during a meeting about the village’s plan with developer Oberer Homes to build duplexes and other affordable housing alongside single-family homes in a sprawling 53-acre area. Chappelle threatened to take his business interests off the table if he wasn’t heard, saying “I am not bluffing.” In December 2020, Chappelle bought a former fire station in Yellow Springs and received approval to transform the space into a restaurant called Firehouse Eatery and a comedy club called Live from YS. Watch Chappelle speak up during the meeting below. Other villagers expressed concern with traffic flow and water management, but more importantly, felt that they were not included in the process of creating the development plan. After the complaints from Chappelle and a number of other residents, the village council deadlocked at a 2-2 vote, meaning that the zoning reverted to 143 single-family homes. Had the plan passed, there would have been 52 duplexes and 24 townhomes, along with an additional 1.75 acres to be donated to the community for affordable housing to be built later. Although Chappelle was born in Washington, DC, he spent summers with his father in Yellow Springs after his parents separated. After exiting Chappelle’s Show, he bought a massive farm there, and in the summer of 2020, he hosted a series of socially-distanced, outdoor standup shows in the township’s Wirrig Pavilion. During the last few months of 2021, Chappelle came under fire for transphobic comments made during his stand-up special Closer. His involvement in nixing an affordable housing plan in his hometown certainly won’t do any favors for his reputation.
