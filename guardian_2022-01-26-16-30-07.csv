1/26/2022,"Gary Shteyngart’s contribution to the burgeoning genre of the lockdown novel is very, very Russian – in the best possible way. The premise is that a group of old friends are to spend a month in the country (well, several months) riding out New York’s pandemic in a little ad hoc colony in the Hudson valley. The cast is a collection of privileged, mournful “lishnii cheloveks” (as the “superfluous men” of 19th-century Russian literature were known) in late middle age, pottering and squabbling in rural exile, wondering what the world is coming to and regretting the past. The host at what comes to be called the “Dacha of Doom” is Sasha Senderovsky, a dishevelled Russian-Jewish-American author who, like Shteyngart, has had considerable success with a series of comic novels about the Russian-Jewish-American experience. Now, though, his career is on the slide and if he can’t get a troubled TV script across the line he faces losing the country estate (well, house with a few bungalows attached) that is his pride and joy. He doesn’t have an actual cherry orchard, but the reader very much gets the drift. Here’s something of a departure – or at least a mellowing – for Shteyngart; the antic international satire of Absurdistan or the science-fictional Super Sad True Love Story is muted, while on his stylistic mixing board the slider marked melancholy has been notched up to 11.  Sasha and his wife Masha and adopted daughter Nat (“Sasha, Masha, Natasha. They didn’t even try, these Russians”) are joined by his college friends Karen, Ed and Vinod. The former are distant cousins of Korean descent, the latter is a down-on-his-luck Gujarati American billed in the dramatis personae as a “former adjunct professor and short-order cook” recovering from lung cancer. Ed is from family wealth, single and – as an extraordinarily detailed and delicious-sounding recipe for veal tonnato indicates – a very good cook. Vinod nurtures a shy, unrequited, lifelong love for Karen. Karen is a wealthy tech-sis, over from the west coast, where she made a fortune with an app called Tröö Emotions that, supposedly, causes people to fall in love. The two wild cards in the group are Dee and a film star known only as The Actor (though, weirdly, we discover very late on that he’s called Joel). Dee is a former writing student of Sasha who has had a hit with a pugnacious essay collection about her poor white upbringing called The Grand Book of Self-Compromise and Surrender. She reveres Joan Didion, uses “y’all” judiciously, and likes to wear cowboy boots and a peasant blouse that “bring out a host of Pavlovian reactions in a wide cross-section of educated East Coast men”. The heroically vain and pretentious Actor – there ostensibly to work on that TV script with Sasha – exerts a power of his own: “Like a small damaged atomic reactor he could generate his own array of ‘feelings’, which he released into the air as background gamma. Everyone at the table except Senderovsky, everyone on the planet, in fact, wanted a dose.” On the first night we find them all on the porch, socially distanced, “seated in their jackets and sweaters at a healthy remove from one another, as if they were organised criminals or dignitaries at the League of Nations”. The effect of the pandemic on writers is drily acknowledged: “Stranded social novelists up and down the river dutifully photographed hard-to-identify flowers and took notes on the appearance of gathering storm fronts and menacing thunderheads. More than one could be found looking up at a slumbering owl or a sunburned meadow beseeching their higher power to help me make something out of all this stillness.” Meanwhile, the dismaying forces of Trumpian America seem to be circling just off stage – white supremacist stickers are posted at the train station, and there are menacing drivebys from pick-up trucks. Soon, Ed and the Actor are both in love with Dee; Masha and Karen are fantasising about the Actor; and K-pop-fan little Nat – who is bright and obsessive – is being semi-adopted by childless Karen. At night, “in accordance with the rules of Russian novels, each thought about another”. One MacGuffin is the manuscript of Vinod’s first novel, which Sasha doesn’t want to admit he’s still hiding in a shoebox in his attic; another is Karen’s app, which is blamed for the Actor chasing Dee. Chekhov’s gun? That would be, I don’t think it’s a spoiler to say, a man with one lung in a Covid epidemic. (The main fault of the book is Vinod’s overlong and slightly repetitious dream/hallucination scenes.) The story is framed by a series of references to Russian literature (near the end, the inhabitants of the colony even stage a production of Uncle Vanya). But this is, being Shteyngart, very far from a solemn tribute to his literary ancestors. Among other things, there’s a pop-cultural parallel as the group become addicted to a Big Brother-style Japanese reality TV show. The real Chekhovianism is the way that Shteyngart’s comic style – the book crackles with good one-liners – is so consistently and to such effect shot through with plangency. Here’s Karen on a country walk: “She stole a great big lungful of a budding forsythia, and then another, a city girl suddenly grateful. Easter would be coming soon, but her mother was still dead.” Or Karen in her bedroom: “There was a piece of paper resting on her side of the bed, the excerpt of a lesson Karen had been teaching Nat, spelling out in Hangul and English the most important of Korean phrases: ‘My head hurts, eyes hurt, mouth hurts, legs hurt, there is too little, there is too much, I don’t like it.’” A deftly equivocal note of sadness towards the end of the book seems to me to capture the tone particularly well: “They sat there between the ferns and the busy bike lane, passing around plates of food, surrounded by faces that looked like their own.” These characters, with their variously thwarted ambitions for love and fame, are wrangling with the realisation that they are ordinary, mortal, vulnerable, just like everyone else.

1/26/2022,"When word reached W Kamau Bell that Bill Cosby was home from prison, the United Shades of America host could have torn at his trademark salt-and-pepper afro. Bell was in Philadelphia, Cosby’s home town, wrapping up interviews for a documentary project on the legendary comedian when Pennsylvania’s highest court tossed out the 84-year-old’s 2018 aggravated indecent assault conviction. The surprise ruling, which came just two years into a decade-long sentence, didn’t just have Bell reconsidering the premise of his film; it left him wondering whether he even had a film at all. “It felt like we could have this conversation because the arc of Bill Cosby’s life is concluded,” Bell said to the Guardian. “So when he got out, it’s like if the premise is ‘now that Bill Cosby’s in prison, we can have this conversation,’ what does it mean now that he’s out of prison? Can we still have the conversation?”  This twist ending is the jumping-off point for We Need to Talk About Cosby – a four-part Showtime documentary series that premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last week. Cosby supporters are bracing for the worst. Music supervisor Vitaly Shenderovsky, leaning on the neat bass licks of the Living Colour frontman Vernon Reid, certainly does his part to strike an anxious tone. Even though uncomfortable conversations are stock-in-trade for Bell, who directs and narrates each hourlong episode, this project was particularly upsetting for him, too. “I consider myself to be a child of Cosby,” says the 48-year-old. “I cannot remember a time in my life when Bill Cosby wasn’t a part of the wallpaper of Black America. So then to find out what we find out, and what I believe about the assaults … I don’t know. Trying to reconcile that or learn something from that was very important to me.” Cosby was more than America’s Dad™. Until more than 60 women came forward and accused him of sexual impropriety, Cosby was a paragon of Black male virtue: athletic in his heyday, intellectually curious at his core and hilarious throughout – a singular voice in the zeitgeist before an unpolished Hannibal Buress rant struck him down from Olympus. Barry Jenkins, in his underrated indie drama Medicine for Melancholy, theorized that every Black man has a Cosby impersonation; a worn-out cassette tape of Bill Cosby: Himself, the comic’s peerless 1983 special, bespeaks my own feeble attempts. But they’re nowhere near as good as the much more effortless ones by Godfrey, the master impressionist and former studio audience warm-up act for Cosby’s shows. While his perspective provides We Need to Talk About Cosby with timely levity, sex therapist Sonalee Rashatwar girds it with emotional intelligence. The New Yorker’s Jelani Cobb, University of North Carolina sociologist Tressie McMillan Cottom, Cosby alum Doug E Doug, Gloria Allred and others fill in the remaining expert witness slots; tellingly, each begins with a deep sigh before grudgingly going about the task of weighing Cosby’s disparate halves. We Need to Talk About Cosby does well to remind viewers of the man’s resonant impacts as a game-changing standup comedian, blockbuster TV star and pro-Black philanthropist. A large chunk of the first episode is devoted to the story of Calvin Brown, the stuntman who opened a barricaded lane in Hollywood for Black performers when Cosby hired him as his double on the seminal 1965 TV drama I Spy. (Before that, white stuntmen would literally paint themselves black to mirror African American actors.) But then ex-Playmate Victoria Valentino pulls the rug out with another story alleging Cosby emotionally leveraged the death of her six-year-old son to drug and rape her in 1969. What the Showtime docuseries does more effectively than any newspaper or magazine article is sync up the accusations against Cosby with his career arc, making the case for his alleged sexual behavior as a disturbing entitlement that was in many ways typical of Hollywood playboys of his generation. In one Larry King Show clip, the host, a renowned playboy himself, can be seen laughing along to a protracted Cosby aside about Spanish fly; if that doesn’t grab you, consider: it was part of a promotional interview for Cosby’s 1991 autobiography, Childhood. As We Need to Talk About Cosby’s slates for release on Sunday the A&E network has already begun unfurling a 10-part docuseries called Secrets of Playboy that paints Hugh Hefner as the host with the most … drug-aided sexual assault parties in Hollywood. “I think it was bigger than Cosby,” Bell says. “Because if it was just him doing this without any sort of industry scaffolding, he can’t pull this off. When they built Hollywood back in the early days, they didn’t start with the human resources department. It’s a dream factory. And the result of making those dreams is living a hedonistic lifestyle. That’s how you get to hide in plain sight.” At one point in We Need to Talk About Cosby the comedian Chris Spencer speaks for all Cosby sympathizers when he recalls how easy it was for him to dismiss the consistency in the Cosby accusers’ stories because each could just watch the last’s big interview and adjust accordingly. But the docuseries hits back by showing the eerie parallels in the way Cosby’s accusers say they were groomed. Apparently, Cosby’s seductions weren’t limited to lavish trips, promises of showbiz breaks or opportunities to pal around with fellow A-listers; in some instances, he ingratiated himself with family members, making it that much more difficult for accusers’ loved ones to believe America’s Dad had been anything less than a gentleman Huxtable. In others, accusers say Cosby had a knack for blaming his roofie-ing on them and tarrying in their lives until they no longer believed the lie or could felt the urgency to go public with allegations. “We couldn’t even really tell some of these stories,” Bell says. “There’s times when [accusers] don’t hear from him for months or longer, and then suddenly he pops back up. So for someone like yourself or someone like me who’s not studying all these cases and just sort of reading the headlines – even if you think it’s wrong and you believe all the women, you can sort of file it as 60 one-night stands that turned into rape. And that’s bad. But it’s different than when you talk to these women and you find out that this went on over the course of years.” Still: there are some things in We Need to Talk About Cosby that, well, aren’t talked about. It glosses over the funnyman’s upbringing, which was a good deal rougher than his comedy made it seem (as Michael Eric Dyson keenly observed in his thorough Cosby biography). And at points the docuseries strains to capture the demon in his art, as if a room full of guild members didn’t write a massive chunk of his material. Worse, the doc skips quickly past the fact that Cosby was never found criminally responsible for any allegation – an uncomfortable conversation well worth having. Cosby only ended up in prison because of his testimony in a civil case was unsealed. That’s why Pennsylvania’s supreme court ultimately chose to vacate his conviction. Bell cites Ezra Edelman’s Oscar-winning OJ: Made in America and dream hampton’s influential Surviving R Kelly docuseries as inspirations. His film slots somewhere in the middle. It isn’t critical race theory or advocacy journalism, but one lifelong fan’s futile attempt to reckon with the unreckonable – how a childhood hero comes to be remembered as a monster. By the end of We Need to Talk About Cosby, you’re left sighing even more heavily than the experts were at the beginning – as much for what Cosby supposedly did as for the cultural legacy that’s definitely done and dusted.

1/26/2022,"Sue Gray’s report will be closely scrutinised by Conservative MPs awaiting the full facts before deciding whether to act against their beleaguered leader. Here are five things to look out for when it is published:  Boris Johnson has already admitted attending the 20 May 2020 garden drinks, but insisted he believed it was a “work event”. That explanation has been widely ridiculed by opposition MPs, who have pointed out the event was organised by a senior Johnson aide, who encouraged guests to “bring their own booze”, and held in the Downing Street garden. Will Gray lay out fresh evidence that makes Johnson’s claim seem even more implausible? In all of Johnson’s public statement on this, he said he believed “implicitly that this was a work event” – a careful use of words. What will Gray make of this? And will she confirm that there were other occasions on which he went to social gatherings that appear not to have complied with the rules at the time – including the birthday singsong revealed by ITV this week? MPs will be weighing up how starkly her findings conflict with Johnson’s assertion in the House of Commons that “all guidance was followed”. Several cabinet ministers have stressed the seriousness of breaking the ministerial code by misleading parliament – traditionally a resigning matter. Gray is expected to lay out details of a boozy work culture in Downing Street – which even included the purchase of a dedicated wine fridge. There is also focus on two parties held the night before Prince Philip’s funeral, reportedly involving a late-night trip to a local supermarket to fill a suitcase with wine bottles. In the weeks since the first stories emerged of a party in Downing Street, a steady stream of other “gatherings” have emerged, many of them in apparent contravention of the lockdown restrictions at the times. Gray may well have uncovered even more. So exactly how many parties were there? The Conservative chair, Oliver Dowden, suggested recently that the prime minister is the person to overhaul what he called, “the kind of culture that has allowed [the partying] to happen in the first place”. But will the facts laid out by Gray suggest that Johnson himself was an integral part of that culture, and must take some of the blame? The only person who has so far resigned over “partygate” is Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s former press secretary, who did not attend the Christmas bash she was caught on camera joking about. Martin Reynolds, Johnson’s principal private secretary, who invited more than 100 Downing Street staff to a garden party on 20 May 2020, seems unlikely to escape censure. It was his excruciating email, leaked to ITV News, that led to some Tory MPs deciding to call for Johnson to quit. He wrote: “Hi all, after what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening. Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze!” Johnson’s director of communications, Jack Doyle, is also widely expected to be singled out – but it is unclear how much wider Gray has cast her net. Rishi Sunak appears to have attended the birthday gathering for Johnson, though aides have said he was awaiting a meeting, but other ministers have so far largely escaped being implicated. Gray is looking into individual parties at the Department for Education and the Department for Work and Pensions; to what extent will she conclude that the problematic culture spread beyond No 10? Several sources, including Dominic Cummings, have suggested there have been social gatherings in the lavishly redecorated Downing Street flat during the pandemic – on the night of Cummings’ departure from government, for example, when witnesses report music blaring from upstairs. Any evidence Gray has uncovered of these get-togethers, would further undermine the idea that Downing Street’s party culture did not ultimately emanate from Johnson himself.",News/Politics,The Gray report: five key questions it could answer,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/26/the-gray-report-five-key-questions-it-could-answer

1/26/2022,"Since 1918, Gingerbread has been supporting, advising and campaigning with single parents to help them meet the needs of their families and achieve their goals. Today, there are 1.8 million single-parent families in the country.  Bárbara: I’m Spanish and I came here 21 years ago to study and got stuck in London. When my son Blaise was born, I was with my partner. But the relationship was never good. I raised my son on my own. All my energy was focused on my son, that he would receive what kids need: sports, friends, teaching, trying to make a normal life around him. As a single parent our work is not valued. I don’t get paid for my 10 years of hard – extremely hard – work that took my son to his place in one of the best schools in London. In 2017 I was homeless. I didn’t know what to do. When I contacted Gingerbread, I thought, ‘Oh, this is my thing.’ Single parents together to help each other. Vikas: I come from India and I’ve been living in London for 18 years. My daughter Kiara is 10. She has been spending equal time with each parent since 2019. It’s not necessarily the ideal co-parenting structure we have – most of the time we are probably parallel parenting. But in the end my daughter is getting a full package – she’s getting the best of what her mum and her dad can give. Being a single parent is not something bad. People have different kinds of families and this is our family setup. I think single dads are often underrepresented. The community does exist and we have our own struggles and challenges. Lana: My son Ruben is six years old. After he was born I was diagnosed with postpartum depression. Luckily, the health visitors helped me to get a place in a mother and baby unit, which was the best thing in the world. I felt safe reaching out to Gingerbread; it has been great for me as a starting point, particularly the social aspect. Other single parents are a massive source of information and emotional support. It really helped me just knowing I wasn’t alone. I think there’s a lot of focus on the negative things about being a single parent, which is fair enough because it’s hard work. But having Ruben in my life is the best thing that ever happened to me. Zemar: I’m a mum to two lovely girls, Dania and Yasmina. After my second divorce, I joined Gingerbread because I needed their support as a single parent. I’ve created lots of beautiful friendships from that group. I use my legal background to help other members. Being a single parent has taught me that you don’t need a partner to be happy. It’s much better and healthier to be a single parent than to stay in a toxic relationship. Being a single parent should be looked at as a gift because you’re given a second chance to lead the life that you want to lead, and to be a positive role model to your child. With the right support and mindset, you can thrive as a single parent. Jamie: I’ve been a single parent for about five and a half years. When you’re a single parent, you do have the opportunity to bond with a child in a way that you might not otherwise. When we are sick we have to care for each other. There’s no one else to do that. But also, we have adventures together. And we can jointly change our plans, you know, be a bit more free-spirited. I think it’s easy to slip into either being so consumed by your child’s specific needs and interests or becoming so wrapped up in your work that you’re expecting them to follow you around. The talent is keeping the household alive so you’re both integrated in each other’s lives in a balanced way. Rhiannon: I’m solo mum to two children. I elected to have kids on my own through donor conception. My daughter was born five years ago, my son in 2021. And now the family is complete. I had to go back to work when my son was four months, [working] two days a week. The first child was the real test; you can’t do everything, you have to let some balls fall. Luckily, in London there’s more solo parents who have made the decision to have a child through donor conception so there is naturally a little bit more of a community. It’s been really hard to get to the point of having a child, let alone bringing one up afterwards, but there’s a lot of happiness that comes with it. It’s worth the trial it took to get me there. Lucy: My family now is me, my eldest son who is 18, my son who has Down syndrome who is 16, and my daughter who is 13. My son with Down syndrome has special educational needs and difficult behaviour. It’s hard because he needs one-to-one care all the time and you always have to fight for provision of services. My other two children are very good, they’re very kind to him. Quite often when you’ve got disabled siblings, I think it makes the other children nicer and kinder. It’s helpful to be in the groups with the other parents who have similar issues. I bet if you did a study, you’d find there was a high divorce rate among families with disabled children. Ema: I’ve been a single parent since Haze was born. I was friends with his father, we were never in a relationship. I don’t get much support. But that’s not a bad thing. That’s how it works. I don’t have to consult anybody. Everything is on me. Everything that’s good that happens is great but anything that doesn’t work, that again is all on me. When you’re on your own, loneliness can get you, and then self-doubt. Gingerbread is a really good start to help you not be on your own. I look at it a bit differently to other people that come into Gingerbread because I’ve always been a single parent. I haven’t had that emotional disconnect of having a relationship that’s just broken down. I feel very blessed that it’s worked out how it has. Carly: I’m a single mum to Ezra, who’s three. I was in a relationship with someone and, unplanned, fell pregnant. I wanted to go ahead with it and he evidently didn’t. So I’ve now made the decision that it’s just us until he’s ready. The everyday challenges are the relentlessness of it. My son’s mixed-race. I’m a white woman. So I think about that a lot – how do I get that right? I’m proud of the relationship I’ve built with Ezra. He’s a really happy, thriving young boy. And I can say that was me, which is a really nice thing. Demi: My twin boys are Alex and Loukas and they are now three. And they’re gorgeous little things. It’s full on. They stopped napping when they turned two; I used to look forward to a break in the afternoon but for the last year they’ve both been awake for a good 12 hours. At the same time we were going through a court process and, unfortunately, my mother passed away as well. After we broke up, it was just me and the boys, me and the boys, me and the boys. By the time I put them to bed, I was so exhausted all I could do was sit on the sofa and stare at the TV. Finding a local Gingerbread support group has been a tremendous help. Tayyaba: I’m an NHS key worker. I feel like I was a single parent from day one because of domestic violence. There was love, but it was without respect. I don’t regret that I was with him because I’m blessed with a boy, but I was abused physically, emotionally and financially. I lived in five or six temporary accommodations because he always found me. Seven years back, I came to a permanent place and I found Gingerbread. I’m able to meet people, talk to them, and I’m able to help other single parents. I feel better when helping other people; it’s like I’m helping myself. The main thing is they are not alone. We are all in the same boat. I can see I’m good as a single parent and I feel proud. Thea: My son Moses is seven years old, and I’ve been a single parent for most of that time. When I became pregnant, his dad and I were just dating and I ended up going ahead with the pregnancy on my own. It was the best decision of my life and now his dad is involved as well. We were both on our own until last year, but during one of the lockdowns we teamed up to do the home schooling. We also started a relationship, and now we’re having another baby. Victoria: I’ve got six children aged from 23 down to nine. My eldest son is autistic. While I’ve been a single parent, we’ve built a family life, got through the pandemic and three of my children have gone off to university. I feel really proud, mostly because they’re incredible. But proud of myself as well, because it’s been really tough at times. I feel proud of my family and our life here. Single parents know that we have to look after our own wellbeing in order to be strong for our children. My children are fine and know that families come in all shapes and sizes. And although it can be exhausting often and lonely sometimes, I am very happy being a single parent.",Arts/Art and design,Single parent strength – a photo essay,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/26/single-parent-strength-a-photo-essay
1/26/2022,"No doubt I speak for every woman on Earth when I say this: thank you, Mars! When I was a little girl I felt as if I could never be my authentic self because of the way the green M&M mascot used to dress. Every time I saw her tottering around in advertisements wearing white go-go boots and fluttering her long eyelashes, a little part of me would die inside. Although young, I recognised something profound: women would only be free when multinationals allowed anthropomorphised chocolate to wear sensible shoes. At long last, that time has come. Last week, Mars Wrigley, the international purveyor of sugary goods, announced that it was revamping (or, rather, de-vamping) its six M&M characters to promote inclusivity. Most notably: the green one is switching out boots for trainers and the brown one is swapping stilettos for kitten heels. It is kind of questionable that they are still forcing the brown one into heels of any kind if you ask me. Nevertheless, it is still a massive step forward for feminism.  Alas, Fox News is not quite so enthusiastic about the fact that chocolate characters that nobody with more than one brain cell gives a damn about are updating their footwear. “M&Ms will not be satisfied until every last cartoon character is deeply unappealing and totally androgynous,” Fox host Tucker Carlson recently railed. “Until the moment you wouldn’t want to have a drink with any one of them. That’s the goal. When you’re totally turned off, we’ve achieved equity.” Yikes, ladies! We were supposed to keep that part of the 2022 feminist agenda secret. Who let Carlson in on the strategy? Still, since we are showing our hand here, let me warn conservatives that fem&minism is just the beginning of the corporate inclusivity revolution. We are not going to rest until Tony the Tiger comes out as non-binary. They’re brrrrrrrave!

1/26/2022,"Bereaved families in England and Wales face increased costs from Wednesday as probate fees rise by up to 76%. Applications for probate, which grants permission to deal with the estate of someone who has died, will now cost a flat rate of £273.  Previously the fee was £155 if a solicitor applied on behalf of a family and £215 for those who applied direct. Lawyers have condemned the price rise, which comes at a time when processing delays have left some families in legal limbo. Michael Culver, the chair of Solicitors for the Elderly, said: “Our members are still reporting an average wait time of six to nine weeks and many agree that the service is still in need of significant improvements.” The government claims that the time to process online applications fell to less than four weeks last spring, but the wait time for all applications averaged at 9.3 weeks in October according to figures from HM Courts and Tribunals Service. The fallout from the pandemic and the closure of regional register offices has meant that some applications have taken months to be granted, leaving families unable to sell their late relative’s home or pay off debts. One family contacted Guardian Money after waiting for 10 months. According to the Ministry of Justice, which governs the probate service, the fee increase will fund a new centralised online system which is replacing paper applications. It had proposed to increased the charge to up to £20,000 for the wealthiest estates, then reduced it to £6,000 before abandoning it in 2019 after an outcry. It will continue to waive fees for estates worth £5,000 or less. According to the Law Society, technical issues with the new system, administrative errors and poor communication have contributied to a backlog. It is calling for families to be offered reimbursements if their application is delayed. It also wants assurances that the fee increase will be used to improve the service. “We support the MoJ’s aim to make a simpler, more streamlined process for users of the probate service, and we understand funds are needed to help this change and development,’ said the Law Society president, I Stephanie Boyce. “We query why the UK government has decided to increase fees at this time, particularly as the probate service is still facing delays.” A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “These fees will fully fund our investment in a first-class digital probate service to ensure shorter waiting times, fewer user and administrative errors, and a better experience for families. “Every penny will go towards the cost of processing probate applications – something that is currently subsidised by taxpayers.”",Lifestyle/Money,Bereaved families in England and Wales face higher costs as probate fees rise,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/26/bereaved-families-in-england-and-wales-face-higher-costs-as-probate-fees-rise
1/26/2022,"I was a toddler when I entered the care system. By the time I left, at 18, I had been shunted between four foster homes and a residential care home, all across south-east London. I met my biological mum for the first time since entering care when I was about 10. I never met my dad. To the knowledge of my various social workers and foster parents, I had no siblings.  But, in my mid-20s, I received a message on social media that changed my life. A stranger about a decade older than me got in touch to tell me that he was my brother. Jeez. Eventually, we spoke on the phone and established that he was my half-brother – we had the same father. He had occasionally babysat me before I was fostered. He also told me that I had at least three other siblings. Perhaps most astounding was the fact that he lived in south Bermondsey – the same part of London as me. Did we ever pass each other in the street? Were we ever on the same bus, or in the same shop? While the revelation of the existence of a brother was mostly welcome, I can still remember the palpable shock and confusion I felt when I read his initial message. An unexpected note from a stranger on Facebook had collided with my already fractured identity, raising a wave of questions about who I was and where I came from. When he got in touch, I was making strides in rebuilding my life after care. I was a graduate and had recently started a career as a journalist at the BBC. I lived on my own terms. I had good friends and a sense of direction, but this message disrupted all of that. Still, I tried to hold it all inside. Despite the magnitude of him getting in touch, we never met in person. We messaged each other a bit for a few weeks and initially I scoured his Facebook profile, but we didn’t pursue a relationship. Years passed without any contact – until the first Covid lockdown. In April 2020, my partner gave birth to our first child. I was finally starting a family of my own. A month or so later, we went back to the hospital for a check-up. To our relief, all was well. As we left, I spotted a man outside the building. We locked eyes. Weirdly, perhaps, I recognised him instantly. He was the brother who had got in touch all those years ago. He looked exactly the same in person as he did in his profile picture. I called his name and, to my relief, he also recognised me. We stood there, outside the hospital, chatting. Time stood still. In that moment, it felt as if we had known each other our whole lives. There was a deep knowing. Nothing was awkward about it. If anything, it felt too normal. He said he was at the hospital visiting his sick mother. I introduced him to my baby, we took a photo together and even made plans to catch up properly in the near future. Since that encounter, though, we haven’t met. For ages after that meeting, I was consumed with questions about my past. Why did social workers and foster carers tell me I was an only child? How did no one with authority in my care experience know about my siblings? Do children’s services even care about, or prioritise learning about, the family histories of looked-after children? That encounter, and the revelation that I had other siblings, touched me deeply. To know that I had siblings as a looked-after child means I am able to take comfort in knowing that there are others who were affected by the decisions of my absent father. Although I don’t know, and may never know, these siblings on a personal level, they serve as a touch point to understanding my past and my sense of identity. Knowing they exist reassures me that I am a part of something bigger than myself. I now have a photo of my brother. A photo of my baby daughter’s uncle. At this stage of my life, knowing they are alive and well is more than enough for me.

1/26/2022,"Moreton-in-Marsh, Honeybourne, Evesham, Pershore … The names of the stations along the Cotswold Line railway are familiar as a nursery rhyme from childhood journeys. I grew up near Oxford, but it’s years since I last travelled west on this line and the distant hills have a blue, remembered air. The little River Evenlode meanders through sheep-dotted fields outside the train window before the wider Avon winds through plum and cherry trees. We cross the Severn among the spires and towers of Worcester and race under the Malverns to emerge near gnarled orchards, overgrown with mistletoe.  Herefordshire is a county for all seasons: once the leaves have fallen, there are glowing church windows, local jams and chutneys, original museums. There are wintry walks to enjoy, before the orchards blossom again, and mulled cider by log fires in half-timbered pubs. All Herefordshire buses are free for everyone at weekends until (it’s hoped) August 2022, with extra services on Sundays. It’s a scheme aimed at encouraging sustainable trips to local towns. I hop on a bus into Ledbury from the railway station, passing cobbled alleys and striking timber-framed houses. “A little town of ancient grace,” the Ledbury-born poet laureate John Masefield called his home town. In the 12th-century parish church there’s a stained-glass Good Shepherd, designed by Edward Burne-Jones and made in William Morris’s workshop. More unusually, an old painting of The Last Supper, now restored and hanging behind the altar, was discovered this spring to be from the school of Titian. I follow the Geopark Way up towards Frith Wood for views across misty hills. A path back down towards the station, past hedges of rosehips and crab apples, runs through an orchard with dozens of different varieties of apple. Each tree stands in a pool of green or crimson windfalls, soon to become Wilces’ craft cider. The farm also rents out bikes (from £12/half day). Back in town, the setting sun spills through old coaching inn archways along the western side of the High Street. Ledbury was a staging post on the road from Hereford to London. The newly refurbished Feathers Hotel, where I’m staying, is one of the oldest inns, kicking off the town’s fashion for black and white buildings (doubles from around £80, B&B, winter offer). I’m sleeping in a two-storey brick cottage off the courtyard, with a tall cherry tree outside and Masefield poems on the walls. Supper, in the Feathers’ restaurant, is a seasonal salad with spice-roasted chickpeas and smoked feta falafel (£15), followed by a citrus-y sugar-crisped lemon and pistachio cake (£7). Soon after breakfast next morning (full veggie with fresh spinach, field mushrooms and tomatoes), I’m heading for a vineyard three miles north of Ledbury. I had planned to catch bus 675 from Ledbury to Loxter and walk the last mile, but the landscape and weather are so inviting that I set off on foot again through boot-soaking dew. I step off a lane and over a footbridge, a couple of hours later, into a sloping field of vines near a timber-framed brick farmhouse. The Geopark Way runs right through Coddington Vineyard and Visit Herefordshire have recently published a five-mile Wine Walk which includes it. There is wine for sale here on Fridays and Saturdays from March and you can stay year-round in a brick cottage or a wood-walled lodge surrounded by vines. The harvest is over, and owner Peter Maiden tells me the volume of grapes in 2021 was astounding, making up for 2020’s frosted crop. The 10-mile walk from Ledbury to Great Malvern overflows with interesting sights. Round the corner, there’s more William Morris stained-glass in Coddington church. Next, I head for Luggs Mill orchard; the Colwall Orchard Group (COG) planted cherry trees here in 2017. I’m following the group’s heritage trail (£2) and soon reach the orchard-ringed allotments of the village garden, where COG have their HQ in an old apple-pressing hut. People are busy digging and harvesting among plots of pumpkins and raspberries, curly kale and marigolds. I buy a bottle of apple juice and chat to trustee Andy Ball about the visiting school parties who help with juicing and the group’s annual events: an Apple Day, a Mistletoe Fair, a January Wassail. A mile further on, I reach Old Court Nurseries with its National Collection of Michaelmas daisies: 430 different varieties are blooming in shades of lilac, violet or magenta across the densely-packed acre-and-a-half of the Picton Garden. The garden reopens on 3 February, entry £4, for snowdrop season, with heritage narcissi budding not far behind. Then it’s time for butternut soup and bread at Café H2O in the GeoCentre, another mile on foot (or five minutes on bus 675), with a side order of hilly panoramas from the picnic tables. From here, it’s a relatively easy mile to the top of Worcestershire Beacon. Swigging apple juice from the bottle, I spin to survey the 360-degree views, feeling like Maria von Trapp crossed with Edward Elgar. The Malvern hills were an inspiration to the composer, who wrote the Enigma Variations. The path down into Great Malvern is much steeper, and the 40-minute bus ride back to Ledbury, past views over the sunset hills, feels gratifyingly long. Olive trees and salvaged statues surround an inviting jumble of chairs and tables near a laden orchard as I hop off bus 476, on route to Hereford next morning, at the Nest farm shop and café. It’s a popular base for wintry walks, full of local crafts and produce: wine from nearby Sixteen Ridges vineyard, handmade Scotch eggs, and books of local hikes. The weather has turned colder and greyer so I relax inside on a re-upholstered cinema seat near the log burner with a big pot of tea; there are Herefordshire rarebits made with cider and deep slabs of quiche, with homemade coleslaw and apple chutney from the trees outside the window. The bus rolls on again, through fields of hops and blackcurrants, into Hereford. My first stop is the Cider Museum (£3 for kids, £5.50 for adults). It’s a 15-minute stroll from the centre or frequent buses 71 and 72 run to nearby Ryelands Street. If you arrive in Hereford by train, you can add a PlusBus ticket for £3.60, which is valid on buses around the city for the whole day. The all-year museum, in Bulmer’s creeper-covered former factory, is full of stone mills and beam presses, bowl goblets and lead crystal flutes. My favourite room is a gallery of watercolour paintings of apples with evocative names: Redstreak, Siberian crab, Strawberry Norman, golden russet. There’s a cider tasting at the end and the shop has bottles of cider brandy from the museum’s own King Offa distillery. Hereford cathedral glows, even on a dull day, with candles, up-lit Norman arches and chandeliers hung from gothic fan vaulting (free). Centuries of stained glass range from medieval fragments and slender lancets to Thomas Denny’s 2007 windows, celebrating the work of 17th-century Herefordshire poet and theologian, Thomas Traherne. “The world shall be a grand jewel of delight unto you,” wrote Traherne and these deeply-coloured windows gleam ruby, emerald and turquoise to conjure his visions of sun-gilded woods and streets whose stones are “precious as gold”. Nearby, the cathedral’s 13th-century calf-skin Mappa Mundi (map of the world) features fantastical satyrs and salamanders and there’s an ancient chained library (£6). The Mappa Mundi museum reopens on 24 January with an exhibition called All Things Bright, showcasing a shiny millennium of religious metalwork. I end up at The Barrels, with half an hour before the last bus, drinking Wye Valley Bitter in an outdoor area hung with dried hops. In my bag is a picnic for the train tomorrow: a local ribstone pippin apple, a small spelt-and-honey sourdough (baked by Peter Cooks) from Fodder delicatessen, and a wedge of tangy oak-smoked Little Hereford (made at nearby Monkland Dairy) from the Mousetrap cheese shop. Walking through the misty streets to Ledbury station next morning, there’s a spirit-raising smell of ripe fruit and wet grass. Masefield wrote in his poem The West Wind: “It’s a fine land, the west land, for hearts as tired as mine,Apple orchards blossom there, and the air’s like wine.”  Train travel was provided by GWR (advance tickets from London Paddington to Ledbury from £18.20).

1/26/2022,"“Buy now, pay later” giant Klarna is putting further pressure on banks and credit card firms by launching its first physical card in the UK. The card will allow customers to delay payments for up to 30 days when used at high street shops, having previously only offered buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) products online for UK customers. The Swedish company said it intends to add more of its payment options, including splitting purchases into three monthly payments, to the card over time.  Klarna confirmed it had built up a waitlist of 400,000 consumers in the UK, which it claimed showed “strong demand for a new approach to credit,” following a successful launch in Germany and Sweden. Klarna Card is part of the payment giant’s latest efforts to rival major credit card firms and banks that offer consumer loans, by giving customers the chance to delay payments at physical shops without incurring interest charges or late fees. “Consumers are rejecting credit products which charge double-digit interest rates while allowing repayments to be put off indefinitely,” Alex Marsh,head of Klarna’s UK operations, said. “For online purchases where credit makes sense, buy-now-pay-later has become the sustainable alternative with no interest and clear payment schedules. The launch of Klarna Card in the UK brings those benefits to the offline world, giving consumers the control and transparency of BNPL for all of their in-store purchases.” The firm – whose BNPL products are unregulated – has enjoyed explosive growth during the pandemic, particularly among the under-30s and those with tight finances. But BNPL products have also drawn criticism, with consumer body Which? warning earlier this month that stronger safeguards are needed to protect the millions of UK shoppers who do not realise they are taking on debt by delaying their payments. Klarna said customers will receive a personalised cap on their spending if they qualify for the card, which will be adjusted automatically after every purchase based on their financial track record. It is understood that for most customers, the cap will likely be worth hundreds, rather than thousands, of pounds. Borrowers will also have to go through credit checks to be eligible for the card.",Lifestyle/Money,"Klarna: ‘buy now, pay later’ firm to launch card in the UK",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/26/klarna-buy-now-pay-later-firm-to-launch-card-in-the-uk
1/26/2022,"Within the brutal machinations of US politics, Joe Manchin has been elevated to a status of supreme decision-maker, the man who could make or break Joe Biden’s presidency. Internationally, however, the Democratic senator’s new fame has been received with puzzlement and growing bitterness, as countries already ravaged by the climate crisis brace themselves for the US – history’s largest ever emitter of planet-heating gases – again failing to pass major climate legislation.  For six months, Manchin has refused to support a sweeping bill to lower emissions, stymieing its progress in an evenly split US Senate where Republicans uniformly oppose climate action. Failure to pass the Build Back Better Act risks wounding Biden politically but the ramifications reverberate far beyond Washington, particularly in developing countries increasingly at the mercy of disastrous climate change. “He’s a villain, he’s a threat to the globe,” said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, based in Bangladesh. “If you talk to the average citizen in Dhaka, they will know who Joe Manchin is. The level of knowledge of American politics here is absolutely amazing, we know about the filibuster and the Senate and so on. “What the Americans do or don’t do on climate will impact the world and it’s incredible that this one coal lobbyist is holding things up. It will cause very bad consequences for us in Bangladesh, unfortunately.” The often tortuous negotiations between Manchin, the White House and Democratic leaders appeared doomed on 19 December when the West Virginia senator said he could not support the $1.75tn bill, citing concerns over inflation and the national debt. The latest twist caused anguish to those who see their futures being decided by a previously obscure politician located thousands of miles away. “I’ve been following the situation closely,” said Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, a low-lying Pacific nation that risks being wiped out by rising sea levels. “We have to halve emissions in this decade and can’t do it without strong, immediate action by the US.” Stege said the Marshall Islands was already suffering the impacts of the climate crisis and if the US doesn’t slash its emissions “the outcomes for countries like mine are unthinkable.” Even America’s closest allies have looked on in dismay as a single lawmaker from Biden’s own party has stalled what would be the biggest – and arguably first – piece of climate legislation in the US’s plodding, and often rancorous, history of dealing with escalating global heating. “Biden has done a fair bit in very challenging circumstances [but] in Canada we look on with bewilderment because it’s such a different political context. It’s very bizarre,” said Catherine McKenna, who was environment minister in Justin Trudeau’s government that introduced carbon pricing in 2019. “Politics is hard but I don’t think anyone has given up. We just really hope they are able to get a deal.” McKenna said she was vilified by some Canadian provincial premiers who “fought to the death” against carbon pricing but that there was now broader support for climate action across the country, including within industry, than in the US. “It’s unfortunate that it’s just one person that is holding up something that’s so critically important,” she said of Manchin. “Joe Manchin is a problem, and I think he needs to be called out,” said Ed Davey, a British MP who was previously the UK’s secretary of state for energy and climate change. “It’s in the US interest, in the interest of West Virginia and elsewhere, to take advantage of green zero-carbon technology, which is the future.” Davey, who is now leader of the Liberal Democrats, warned that the US risks ceding leadership in clean energy to China if it doesn’t act. “People will end up paying higher prices, jobs will go and not be created, the security of America will be reduced, Beijing will be laughing,” he said, adding that Manchin was in effect “working on behalf of the Chinese government” by not supporting the transition away from fossil fuels. China used last year’s Cop26 climate talks in Scotland to “insidiously point out to every country that US just can’t implement”, said Rachel Kyte, an expert in international affairs at Tufts University and a climate adviser to the UN secretary general. Kyte said many governments believe Biden is well-meaning but cannot follow through on his commitments, a frustration compounded by a lack of American action on related areas, such as climate finance for poorer countries. “There’s almost a resentment that the US just can’t deliver,” she added. “There’s this sinking feeling about the politics of America. You can’t turn your back on the US because it’s still the biggest economy, but what are countries supposed to do?” Much of this angst is now being channeled towards Manchin. After more than a decade in national politics, the 74-year-old senator has suddenly garnered a level of infamy far beyond his fiefdom of West Virginia, where the centrist Democrat has served as governor and senator while reaping millions of dollars through his personal investments and campaign contributions from a coal industry that continues to loom large in his state. It’s a situation that has caused bafflement overseas. “Who is Manchin, the Dem senator from West Virginia who betrayed Biden?” La Repubblica in Italy has demanded. Clarín, a newspaper in Argentina, has called Manchin a “rebelde” and a “tycoon with ties to the mining structure of West Virginia, the other Virginia of the USA”. Helsingin Sanomat, a Danish newspaper, also noted Manchin’s links to the fossil fuel industry and lamented that he has “disagreed with the most ambitious climate action” put forward by the US. The negotiations with Manchin involve stakes far greater than any normal political maneuvering in Washington. The world is already being strafed by wildfires, heatwaves, floods and societal instability wrought by the climate crisis and rising temperatures are on track to breach limits set by governments in the Paris climate accords, a situation that would push some parts of the world beyond human livability. Salvaging this situation will be virtually impossible without swift action by the US, the world’s second largest carbon polluter and a major oil and gas exporter. Analysts say the half a trillion dollars of support for renewable energy and electric cars in the Build Back Better bill would give the US a decent chance of cutting its emissions in half this decade, which Biden and scientists say is imperative to avoid climate breakdown. But Manchin’s opposition has already ensured the removal of a key element of the bill, a plan to force utilities to phase in clean energy over time, and the prospect of him joining Republicans to block the overall package has seen him come under intense criticism within the US. Climate activists have confronted Manchin in Washington and kayaked to his yacht to remonstrate with him. Some fellow Democrats say he has “failed the American people”. Even the Sunday Gazette, the local paper of Charleston, West Virginia, has run a headline of ‘We need this so bad’, in reference to the bill. All this has been to little effect, although Manchin did say earlier this month there could still be agreement on “the climate thing”, offering some vague hope to activists while not quite quelling their anger. “Senator Manchin is a fossil-fueled sociopath on a Maserati joyride while he lets the world burn,” said Janet Redman, climate campaign director at Greenpeace USA. “At the end of the day, Manchin cares less about his constituents than he does about the fossil fuel industry.” The current, floundering attempt to pass climate legislation is a grimly familiar episode in a lengthy record of American inadequacy. Donald Trump donned a coal miner’s helmet on the campaign trail and removed the US from the Paris climate deal. Barack Obama failed to get cap-and-trade legislation past a recalcitrant Congress. George W Bush rejected the Kyoto climate accords. In 1993, a previous Democratic senator from West Virginia, Robert Byrd, blocked a Bill Clinton plan to tax carbon emissions. Manchin is, in some respects, a “fall guy” for a deeper American political dysfunction over the climate crisis, Kyte said. “If Republicans weren’t in the lock-grip of certain vested interests, if they had a policy on climate adaptation or green jobs for the future, Joe Manchin wouldn’t have the influence he has,” she said. “Joe Manchin has become the personification of a problem and removing him doesn’t solve it,” Kyte added. “It doesn’t give us a bipartisan agreement of the danger we are in. A political culture that allows you to enrich yourself and your family from industries you regulate and not declare a conflict of interest lies beyond Joe Manchin, it’s bigger than just him.” Even if American political inertia hasn’t changed, the world certainly has – the last seven years were the planet’s hottest on record, cataclysmic wildfires are now year-round events in the US west and deadly flooding swamps basements in New York, picturesque towns in Germany and subways in China. There is mounting fear that the world, including the US, does not have the time for yet another futile American effort to address the unraveling climate crisis. “Unfortunately, politicians getting fossil fuel money are standing in the way and sacrificing the rest of us once again,” said Vanessa Nakate, a climate justice activist from Uganda. Nakate pointed out that Africa was suffering from climate change even though it is responsible for just a small fraction of global emissions. “We are so reliant on the choices others make,” she said. “Our lives are literally in their hands.”",News/US news,‘He’s a villain’: Joe Manchin attracts global anger over climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/26/joe-manchin-climate-crisis-global-villain
1/26/2022,"The lives of LGBTQ+ people in Afghanistan have “dramatically worsened” under Taliban rule, according to a new survey, which highlights cases of violence, gang-rape and death threats since the group seized power last year. The report, by Human Rights Watch (HRW), recorded nearly 60 cases of targeted violence against LGBTQ+ people since August 2021, many of whom described how Taliban rule has destroyed their lives.  “Things were always rough,” said Heather Barr, associate director of the women’s rights division at HRW. “But people had found ways to survive and build community and support each other, and they had hope that things were gradually improving. On 15 August, all of that ended.” Homosexuality was banned under Ashraf Ghani, the ousted president of Afghanistan, and punishable with prison. However, the HRW report said that the Taliban “vowed to take a hard line against the rights of LGBT people” and cited sharia law. “We spoke with LGBT Afghans who have survived gang-rape, mob attacks, or have been hunted by their own family members who joined the Taliban, and they have no hope that state institutions will protect them,” said J Lester Feder, senior fellow for emergency research at OutRight Action International, who contributed to the report. “For those LGBT people who want to flee the country, there are few good options; most of Afghanistan’s neighbours also criminalise same-sex relations. It is difficult to overstate how devastating – and terrifying – the return of Taliban rule has been for LGBT Afghans.” Zeba Gul*, 16, described to the Guardian how her life had worsened in the last few months. “I like to wear makeup, I like dresses, and I love to dance. But my family didn’t allow all that,” the teenager told the Guardian. “They would lock me up with chains and beat me. They would shave my head, tear my clothes and swear at me, calling me ezaak [a derogatory term for homosexuals].” Gul described the horrors of growing up as a transperson in a deeply conservative country like Afghanistan. Before the Taliban came to her town in western Afghanistan, she was tormented as an object of shame by her family, but after 15 August, the risk to her life became grave. “After the Taliban came to power, my family threw me out of the house. It is the peak of winter and I sleep in the parks. I have been attacked. I have been raped. The Taliban held me for three days and beat me,” she said. “I have no one [to care for me].” Faraydoon Fakoori, at Paiwand 34, an organisation working to help gender minorities in Afghanistan, said: “Afghanistan has always been a conservative society, but after the arrival of the Taliban, the situation has worsened. We are seeing many cases of violence, harassment and even rape.” Gul said: “The return of the Taliban empowered vigilantes, homophobes, and a lot of people nurturing long-term feuds. On 14 August, your ex-wife’s angry brothers, your spurned ex, your prejudiced neighbour or uncle might have felt like they wished they could harm you, but it wasn’t worth going to prison for. On 16 August, it was open season, with no fear of punishment.” In 2021, a Taliban spokesperson told Germany’s Bild newspaper: “For homosexuals, there can only be two punishments: either stoning, or he must stand behind a wall that will fall down on him.” *Name has been changed  Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

1/26/2022,"Hello, I’m Warren Murray. Make up your own mind, but hear me out first.  Boris Johnson is braced for the most perilous 48 hours of his premiership, with Conservative MPs due to see Sue Gray’s report into Downing Street lockdown parties. The Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, has meanwhile announced that her officers are investigating the parties and “I don’t anticipate any difficulty in obtaining the evidence that it is … necessary, proportionate and appropriate for us to obtain in order to get to the right conclusions”. Those found to have breached regulations could be fined. Arch-critics of the prime minister are hopeful that Gray’s findings will be damaging enough to trigger what they believe will be the final trickle of letters needed to get to 54 and force a no confidence vote. A Conservative MP has caused mirth by claiming Johnson was “ambushed with a cake” at his birthday gathering in Downing Street during lockdown. Conor Burns told Channel 4 News on Tuesday evening that the gathering was “not a premeditated, organised party … He was, in a sense, ambushed with a cake.” Backup plan if Russia cuts gas – Natural gas supplies from around the world could be diverted to Europe if Vladimir Putin cuts the flow from Russia as part of an invasion of Ukraine. US officials said on Tuesday that they had been negotiating with global suppliers and were confident that Europe would not suffer from a sudden loss of energy for heating in the middle of winter. Joe Biden said on Tuesday if Russia attacked, it would be the “largest invasion since world war two” and would “change the world”. The US president said he would consider imposing personal sanctions on his Russian counterpart.

More Pegasus revelations – The mobile phones of a senior Human Rights Watch staff member are alleged to have been repeatedly hacked by a client of NSO Group at a time when she was investigating the August 2020 explosion that killed more than 200 people in Beirut. The alleged hacking of Lama Fakih, a US-Lebanese citizen and director of crisis and conflict at HRW, marks the latest example of how NSO’s powerful surveillance tool, Pegasus, has been used to target campaigners and journalists. On Tuesday, NSO’s chairman, Asher Levy, said he was stepping down but denied it had any connection to recent developments. ‘Ghost flights’ spew carbon – At least 100,000 “ghost flights” could happen across Europe this winter just so airlines can keep their EU take-off and landing rights, according to Greenpeace. It says the deserted, unnecessary or unprofitable flights could also generate up to 2.1 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. The Lufthansa CEO, Carsten Spohr, said his airline may have to fly 18,000 such flights to meet the rules, and called for exemptions. The European Commission denies causing the problem: “If airline companies decide to keep empty flights, this is a company decision, which is not the result of EU rules.” The Ryanair CEO, Michael O’Leary, said airlines like Lufthansa should sell unfilled seats at cheap prices and be forced to release unused airport slots.

There are also dozens of newly identified reptiles, frogs and newts, fish and 155 plant species, including the only known succulent bamboo species, found in Laos.

It’s another “continuing furore” edition of our front page roundup today. Here is the full version, whittled down follows. The Mirror’s headline is “Number’s up, PM” and it reports that “Sue Gray has pics of Johnson with wine bottles at No 10 parties as police launch criminal probe”. Our Guardian front page describes the “PM’s peril: report looms as police step in over parties”. The focus of the Telegraph’s front page is also the Gray report and the “mounting pressure” for Johnson to publish it in full. The Daily Express wants us to think the Scotland Yard probe has actually been welcomed by Johnson and says “Yes PM, we all want ‘line drawn under’ partygate’”. The Sun has “Cops probe partygate” and says “Ten Downing Street is now a crime scene”. The i newspaper leads with the Metropolitan police investigation and a photo of an anxious-looking PM. The Daily Mail rather incredibly argues we are “A nation that’s lost all sense of proportion”, suggesting partygate should be brushed aside because there are other bad things going on in the world. The Times plays it straight: “Johnson faces police interview over parties”. The Independent follows suits with: “Now police investigate Downing Street parties”. The Financial Times has “Johnson gears up for survival fight”, quoting one Tory MP as saying: “He believes he’ll get out of this. His optimism is more than skin deep.” The Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
