4/27/2022,"The Royal Shakespeare Company is to stage an adaptation of the celebrated Japanese animation feature film, My Neighbour Totoro, in a production it promises will be ambitious and spectacular. The 1988 film became a global success after Netflix acquired the rights to 21 movies from Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation giant, in 2020. The world premiere of the stage adaptation, directed by Phelim McDermott and featuring puppets created by Basil Twist, will have a limited run of 15 weeks at the Barbican from October until January. Erica Whyman, the RSC’s acting artistic director, said: “Adapting this deeply loved magical story for the stage is the next chapter in our longstanding commitment to making spectacular and accessible productions that see the world through the eyes of children.” She expected the show would attract “a wide range of theatre audiences as well as loyal fans of the original film”. My Neighbour Totoro tells the story of two young sisters, Satsuki and Mei, who move to the countryside with their father to be close to their mother who is in hospital. While adjusting to their new surroundings, they discover a fantasy world of woodland creatures and spirits, invisible to grownups. “It’s a captivating world you won’t want to come home from,” said the Guardian in its 2013 review. Studio Ghibli – the world’s second biggest animation studio after Disney – has produced numerous acclaimed films including Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke and Kiki’s Delivery Service. The RSC’s stage version will be adapted from the movie by Tom Morton-Smith, whose credits include Oppenheimer and Ravens. My Neighbour Totoro was a “very wholesome, beautiful world that washes over you”, he said. “These young girls are discovering nature for the first time, so there are long shots of a snail on a leaf or a fish in a stream or a frog jumping in a puddle. It doesn’t feel particularly propelled by a plot, it’s just a world you inhabit.” Capturing that atmosphere on stage was a challenge, said Morton-Smith. Music for the stage show – created by Joe Hisaishi, the film’s original composer – is “beautiful, and the songs are really evocative and atmospheric, and they do a lot of the work of transporting us”, said Morton-Smith. Hisaishi said the stage adaptation was a groundbreaking project. “In Japan, many people are passionate about theatre and musicals, but there are no original Japanese shows or musicals performed in the world. Totoro is a Japanese work famous throughout the world, and so this stage adaptation could have the potential to reach global audiences. “If the story is universal – as I believe it is – it will have a global reach even if it is performed by people from different cultural backgrounds speaking different languages.” The stage version of My Neighbour Totoro will be the RSC’s first opening “of this scale” since Les Miserables in 1985, said an RSC spokesperson. Les Mis has won multiple awards, as has the RSC’s production of Matilda the Musical, its adaptation of the popular Roald Dahl book.",Arts/Stage,RSC to stage adaptation of animated fantasy film My Neighbour Totoro ,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/27/rsc-to-stage-adaptation-of-animated-fantasy-film-my-neighbour-totoro
4/27/2022,"Leanne Greening has just enough money each week to put a roof over her head and pay her bills. Greening, who is a carer for her two autistic children, is one of a growing number of Australians grappling with the rapidly rising cost of living coupled with a rental crisis hitting regional and urban centres. “I often rely on charities, even just to buy clothes,” she says. “The cost of living has gone crazy … I don’t always manage to make ends meet. Basically I’m alive, and that’s it.” She doesn’t have a budget for food, petrol or emergencies beyond whatever’s left after rent for her transitional property on Melbourne’s outskirts is deducted from her Centrelink carer’s payment. Greening’s weekly shop used to cost about $100. Now, it has swelled beyond $200, despite buying in bulk and relying on specials. At the same time, her electricity bill has risen by a third, and her gas bill has risen by $100 a month, which she fears will spike further over winter. “If we have meat it’s mince and sausages because that’s all we can afford. We try not to put the heater on and things like that because it just makes the bills go higher,” she says. “And petrol has doubled. My oldest son says he’s working to pay his fuel bill.” New inflation figures released on Wednesday showed the largest annual rises since the introduction of GST. The consumer price index (CPI) hit 5.1% annually and increased by 2.1% compared to the last quarter in December 2021. The greatest increases were in fuel, which rose by 11% in the quarter, new dwellings (up by 5.7%) and tertiary education (up by 6.3%), in part due to continued supply shortages and flow on from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Prices for food and other grocery items also saw a significant rise, with vegetables up by 6.6% quarterly, non-durable household items like toilet paper up by 6.7% and beef up by 7.6%. Those struggling with rising costs say the government isn’t doing enough. This year’s federal budget offered one-off payments of $250 for pensioners and concession card holders and up to $420 for middle-income workers. It also halved the fuel excise for a limited six-month period – saving about $15 on the average price for a tank of petrol. But industry bodies have dismissed the cash splash as providing only modest relief to address sharp rises in the cost of living while overlooking those already on low income support payments. The Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) CEO, Cassandra Goldie, says the handouts were a “disappointing … temporary fix” to long-term challenges. Acoss has called on major parties to raise the “punishingly low” income support rate of $46 a day to at least $70 for jobseeker and other payments, and to provide additional support to single parents, people with a disability and private renters. If elected, Labor has committed to a $10bn social housing fund which would build 30,000 new social and affordable housing properties over the next five years. It would also introduce a national housing and homelessness plan. In his budget reply speech the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, flagged Labor would consider further support to ease cost of living pressures if necessary, once the temporary cut to fuel excise ends in September. But neither major party has agreed to raising the jobseeker rate in the next federal budget. Acoss is also pushing for greater investment in essential services and a wages boost for those in the lowest 40% bracket – predominantly women. Of approximately 2.4 million people relying on income support as their primary source of income – two-thirds are women. Goldie says soaring rent prices, coupled with a lack of social housing and available private rentals, are forcing more people into homelessness and financial hardship. “For anyone on a low income, the biggest cost is your housing,” she says. “You don’t get a more important protector of good mental health than having basic security … a place to live, and enough income to cover the essentials.” The cost of living is accelerating at an even higher rate in regional Australia – 4.1% in the 12 months to December 2021 compared to 3.1% in Sydney and 2.5% in Melbourne. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Rebecca Goldsmith is grappling with the prospect of homelessness after being given 30 days notice to vacate her property in the Victorian town of Swan Hill. A pregnant mother of three toddlers, she says prices have been rising since Covid hit. “The rental crisis is bullshit,” she says. “I can’t even get public housing as there’s none vacant. “A three bedroom in my area used to be around $250 a week. Now they are anywhere between $300 and $420.” Goldsmith has limited her driving due to fuel prices, and is worried about the expense of moving her items to a storage unit. She says she can’t understand why extra payments provided to receivers of income support throughout Covid were pulled while people were still struggling. “They stopped them while the cost of living increased,” she says. “Supermarket prices have gone up. I used to be able to do my shopping for like $250 a week. Now I’m spending close to $350, $400. It doesn’t make any sense. “I’m facing the prospect of living in a caravan.” For 70-year-old grandmother Kaye Thistleton, despite living on an aged pension , she’s been priced out of the Bega area in New South Wales and is downsizing to make ends meet. “I’m at the stage of my life where I’m starting to need more support, not less,” she says. “It’s horrific.” Thistleton has been searching for a rental property since being issued with a lease termination notice during lockdown last year. Her region has faced a severe housing crisis for years, exacerbated by bushfires and floods, and reaching a crisis point with the pandemic. Meanwhile, Thistelton’s daughter has been paying $600 a week for a motel room for her and her 13-year-old son after their rental property became infested with black mould. Returning from visiting them, Thistelton regularly bursts into tears. “I have no savings, my age pension is it, I can’t say ‘here’s $5,000 go and put a bond on a house,’” she says. Thistleton says she’s had to let go of certain things she once took for granted. “I’ve had to pull my belt in really hard … I live frugally anyway but now it’s a matter of standing at the supermarket shelves and working out which is the cheapest product to buy,” she says. “I’ve cancelled different services, I have the internet here but I’m thinking of cutting it back. I look around thinking ‘can I sell this, can I sell that’? “I barely drive any more with fuel prices going up. I get a $250 fuel voucher for 12 months … if I’m going to town, I’ve got to do everything I possibly can in one trip.” Thistelton’s biggest fear is for her grandson, who grapples with the uncertainty of homelessness. “He’s on this rollercoaster,” she says. “I just despair for him … we must be able to tuck our kids into a house with a roof every single night of their lives, and that’s not happening. “We’re out of sight, out of mind, like an iceberg. You see a tip but you can’t see what’s underneath the surface: old people, children, babies that are homeless.”",News/Australia news,"‘I’m alive, and that’s it’: rising cost of living puts pressure on people already struggling",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/27/im-alive-and-thats-it-rising-cost-of-living-puts-pressure-on-people-already-struggling
4/27/2022,"More than 6,500 reports of understaffing and unsafe conditions in Australia’s aged care sector, including hundreds of reports of resident injuries, will be handed to the regulator on Wednesday. The reports, from United Workers Union (UWU) whistleblower site Aged Care Watch, identified thousands of instances of aged care residents’ safety suffering due to unfilled shifts and understaffing. Some 2,300 reports named a “distressed resident”, while 1,900 named a resident left soiled for an “extended period” and 600 said a resident was injured due to lack of care. The findings will be delivered to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission on Wednesday. UWU aged care director Carolyn Smith said the findings, gathered from workers, family members and care residents, were only the “tip of the iceberg”. “These reports come from every state of Australia and show the inside story of the aged care crisis that continues to impact the care of aged care residents,” she said. “It’s a sad fact that even before Covid aged care was a shambles and now it’s even worse. “The accounts from inside aged care facilities are horrifying.” Aged care workers describe instances of incontinence pads unchanged for 16 hours, wounds left untreated and weight loss due to residents not being helped with their food. Some 2,900 reports named a “stressed staff member” due to understaffing, with almost 10,000 unfilled shifts and more than 800 personal accounts of unsafe incidents resulting from lack of care time. “These firsthand accounts from aged care workers provide extensive further evidence of the massive failure of the federal government in residential aged care,” Smith said. “The failures … also show why thousands of aged care workers feel they have no option but to go on strike and hold their employers accountable.” Aged care workers across Australia voted last week to take industrial action over acute staff shortages and continuing low rates of pay hitting the sector. Members at five aged care providers collectively employing 7,000 workers voted overwhelmingly in favour of the industrial action, likely to take place prior to the 21 May election. One aged care worker in the hospitality sector, based in Western Australia, said in the report they spent a large percentage of their shift running from the kitchen to answer cries for help from residents. “There might be two to three [carers] on one wing for up to 48 residents,” they said. “I have found residents on the floor and no one about to come help them.” Another aged care worker based in South Australia said they were suffering burnout, stress and anxiety due to the uncertainty of staffing. “Many hospitality shifts are unfilled, training is absolutely minimal for new staff, agency is regularly unavailable,” they said. “My colleague recently was hurt due to working above and beyond an acceptable workload to compensate. “My mental health has suffered terribly and I’m now at breaking point.” Both major parties have made major election pledges to better fund the sector including to uphold any pay rise awarded by the Fair Work Commission, which is currently hearing a claim to lift the pay of aged care workers 25% above the award. Labor has promised to spend $2.5bn on aged care including a 24-hour registered onsite nurse in every facility. In response to the aged care royal commission, the Coalition vowed to boost the number of home care packages and deliver aged care workers an $800 bonus.",News/Australia news,Thousands of shocking reports reveal extent of Australian aged care residents’ suffering due to understaffing,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/27/thousands-of-shocking-reports-reveal-extent-of-australian-aged-care-residents-suffering-due-to-understaffing
4/27/2022,"Russia will stop supplying gas to Poland and Bulgaria from Wednesday. Warsaw has refused to pay its supplier, Gazprom, in roubles and earlier announced that it was imposing sanctions on 50 entities and individuals including Russia’s biggest gas company. Bulgaria, which is almost completely reliant on Russian gas imports, said it had fulfilled all its contractual obligations with Gazprom and that the proposed new payment scheme was in breach of the arrangement. Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russia was “beginning the gas blackmail of Europe”. Russia’s defence ministry warned of an immediate “proportional response” if Britain continues its “direct provocation” of the Kyiv regime, after the UK armed forces minister, James Heappey, described Ukrainian strikes on Russian soil that hit supplies and disrupt logistics as “completely legitimate”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he believes Russia is trying to destabilise the situation in Moldova’s Transnistrian region after a series of explosions there, adding that Ukrainian armed forces were ready for a possible escalation by Russian troops in the temporarily occupied territory. “The goal is obvious – to destabilise the situation in the region, to threaten Moldova. They show that if Moldova supports Ukraine, there will be certain steps,” Zelenskiy said in his latest national address. Russia has refused to rule out Moldova’s breakaway region Transnistria being drawn into the Ukraine war Zelenskiy said the “free world has the right to self-defence” after predicting that Russia intends to not only seize the territory of Ukraine but to “dismember the entire centre and east of Europe” and “deal a global blow to democracy”. Britain’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is expected to call on allies of Ukraine to “ramp up” and “double down” on military production including of planes and tanks in a speech set to be delivered on Wednesday. Truss said the UK’s new approach “will be based on three areas: military strength, economic security and deeper global alliances”. Russia’s victory will have “terrible consequences across the globe”, Truss is expected to say. “We must be prepared for the long haul and double down on our support for Ukraine. Germany will authorise the delivery of 50 anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, the German defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, said. Lambrecht said the government has agreed to sign off the delivery of around 50 Gepard anti-aircraft weapons systems. Switzerland said it had blocked Germany from sending Swiss-made ammunition used in Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine. The United States vowed to move “heaven and earth” to help Ukraine win its battle against Russia’s invasion as it hosted defence talks in Germany with allies from 40 nations on Tuesday. The gathering is being led by the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, following his meeting with Zelenskiy on Sunday. Austin said the west was gearing up to help Ukraine for “the long haul” and would take steps to boost its rearmament. Australia will send six M777 howitzers and ammunition to Ukraine as part of a A$26.7m package in its response to “Russia’s brutal, unrelenting and illegal invasion” a statement from prime minister Scott Morrison and defence minster Peter Dutton said on Wednesday. Canada aims to send eight armoured vehicles “as quickly as possible”, minister of defence Anita Anand announced. The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, travelled to Moscow and, in a joint press conference with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, Guterres said the UN was “ready to fully mobilise its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol”. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereschuk, said there was “no point” in the UN if there was no real humanitarian corridor from Mariupol. Guterres also met Russian president Vladimir Putin who described the situation in the besieged city of Mariupol as “tragic” and “complicated”. Moscow and Kyiv were continuing talks online, Putin said. Russia has dismissed Ukraine’s proposal to stage peace talks in Mariupol. Lavrov said it was too early to talk about who would mediate in any negotiations, but he said Moscow was committed to a diplomatic solution via talks on Ukraine. The head of the UN’s atomic watchdog has condemned the Russian occupation of the Chernobyl nuclear plant, describing it as “very, very dangerous”. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director general, Rafael Grossi, is heading an expert mission thre to “deliver equipment, conduct radiological assessments and restore safeguards monitoring systems”. Zelenskiy said “no one in the world can feel safe” after Russia threatened Ukraine’s nuclear facilities and called for “global control” over Russia’s nuclear facilities and nuclear technology after meeting with director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi. “No other country in the world since 1986 has posed such a major threat to nuclear security, to Europe and the world” he said. British prime minister Boris Johnson said he does not expect Putin to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Johnson said Putin “has a lot of room for manoeuvre” and could back down.
