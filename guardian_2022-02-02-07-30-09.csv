2/2/2022,"Ange Postecoglou, the Celtic manager, has cautioned that the status of Aaron Ramsey does not guarantee the on-loan Juventus midfielder will succeed at Rangers. Ramsey was a surprise deadline day arrival at Ibrox and although he is not fit enough to face Celtic on Wednesday evening, there is excitement in Glasgow’s blue half that the former Arsenal player could have a defining say in the title race.  Rangers are two points clear of their oldest foes as they head to Celtic for the second Old Firm match of the campaign. Postecoglou, while insisting he is far more interested in his own personnel, pointed towards the lack of fanfare around the summer arrival of Kyogo Furuhashi – who has excelled at Celtic – when asked about Ramsey. “I don’t really get affected by what others do,” he said. “I’ve said it before: my focus is on what happens here. You can’t start worrying about what other clubs could potentially do or what players they bring in. “Ultimately all these things come down to performances. No one had heard of Kyogo but you can’t tell me he’s not had an impact. It’s more about the impact they have. When opposition sides bring in new players it’s about looking how they perform and how they fit in and us trying to counteract that. Are there no guarantees? Absolutely. And it’s not an easy league to do it in. It’s been proven before. But my perspective is on us.” The Rangers manager, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, said of the latest high-profile arrival in Scottish football: “To be able to bring in a player like Aaron was a very good opportunity for us. He will bring experience and quality to the squad. It is too soon for him to be involved [against Celtic] but I expect him to be in the squad really quickly.” Celtic could call upon their captain, Callum McGregor, despite the serious facial injury he suffered in a Scottish Cup tie at Alloa less than two weeks ago. “He will only play if he feels he is at his best,” Postecoglou said. “If he doesn’t think he can be at his best then he will wait until that time is right. I’m not doubting his courage or his intent to play, but he also wants to be at his best because he knows it is an important game and he wants to help in the right possible way.” Celtic have not beaten Rangers in the league since September 2019 and at all since December of the same year. After Rangers won the championship with 25 points to spare last season, the closeness of the teams thus far has led to rave reviews for Postecoglou. “These kinds of narratives work well but the reality is when you represent this football club, even if you’ve won the last nine, you are expected to win the 10th,” said the Australian. “It doesn’t matter if you’ve won or lost in previous encounters. What’s important is what you do in the next one. We have to go out there and play our football. We have been in good form and consistent for quite a while. We’ll bring that to this game and hopefully get the job done.”",Sport/Football,Ange Postecoglou says ‘no guarantees’ Aaron Ramsey will succeed at Rangers,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/01/ange-postecoglou-says-no-guarantees-aaron-ramsey-will-succeed-at-rangers
2/2/2022,"England’s plans for the Calcutta Cup collision in Edinburgh on Saturday have been dealt a heavy double blow with the captain, Courtney Lawes, and the lock Jonny Hill both confirmed absentees through injury. The head coach, Eddie Jones, will now have to find an alternative captain and fill two more sizeable holes in his already reshuffled team to face Scotland at Murrayfield. Neither Lawes nor Hill has been able to train fully this week because of concussion and a stress fracture of the leg respectively and Jones has now accepted he must look elsewhere. The absence of Lawes, who was replaced after taking a blow in the second half of Northampton’s game against Ulster this month, means the captaincy is now likely to pass to Sale’s Tom Curry or, conceivably, Exeter’s Luke Cowan-Dickie.  With Owen Farrell, Manu Tuilagi and Jonny May already sidelined before a significant game for both sides, it leaves Jones uncomfortably short of experience on the eve of the Six Nations championship. While Joe Marler is now back from his period of Covid isolation, either Bath’s Charlie Ewels or Northampton’s Nick Isiekwe is now likely to start in the second row with Leicester’s uncapped Ollie Chessum a potential bench candidate. Raffi Quirke, Joe Heyes, Luke Northmore, Alfie Barbeary, Adam Radwan, Orlando Bailey, Louis Lynagh have also been cut from the enlarged training squad, leaving Mark Atkinson and Harry Randall as likely matchday squad members for a game that will test England’s depth and resolve. “The two things that have been really spoken about are the resilience of the team and how the team rallies around each other in adversity,” the scrum coach Matt Proudfoot said. The weather is also set to be a sizeable factor, with heavy rain and gusty winds anticipated on Saturday. Proudfoot, a former Scottish international, is fully aware just how tricky the Murrayfield elements can be and says the visiting coaching staff “have been keeping a very close eye” on the Edinburgh forecast. “The nature of Murrayfield means the wind plays a massive factor,” he said. “You need experience of having played there and of how the wind swirls in the stadium. We are trying to replicate that for the players so they will be used to it when they get there.” Proudfoot also insists England do not have a leadership vacuum in the absence of so many familiar names and that Curry, Cowan-Dickie and Ellis Genge are all equipped to step up. “I think we are in a good position when it comes to leadership,” he said. “It is not led by one man, it is led by a group of people.” There is still a faint chance, however, that Harlequins’ Joe Marchant might feature, despite having been forced to train at home this week after testing positive for Covid last Friday. London Irish’s uncapped wing Ollie Hassell-Collins has also been retained along with Exeter’s Jack Nowell. Collectively England are clearly already braced for a thunderous encounter with Cowan-Dickie under no illusions – “Anything they do right or we do wrong you are going to know about it” – about the likely atmosphere. Jones’s team have also won just one of their past four matches with Scotland and Proudfoot says the intensity of training has visibly ramped up: “Yesterday’s training session was tough. The boys took it to each other because they know what’s coming this weekend.” England will at least go into the game feeling well fed, with the celebrity chef Tom Kerridge having been invited into camp to cook up a barbecue for them. It is the sizeable amount of Scottish beef awaiting them on Saturday, though, that will ultimately shape their campaign.",Sport/Sport,Blow for England as Lawes and Hill are ruled out of Scotland clash,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/01/blow-for-england-as-lawes-and-hill-are-ruled-out-of-scotland-clash
2/2/2022,"The final two hours of the Canberra Test will be replayed again and again. The dying hours of the fourth day, players on both teams losing their nerve and then finding it again. The way the match swung back and forth, from England can’t win it, to England can’t fail to win it, to the last passage where the upper hand changed by the over, by the delivery. Exhaustion, confusion, moments of supreme skill, experienced players having their poise desert them, inexperienced players forging on with the boldness of the young. In the breathless moment after it was done, no winner, two winners, and a point at which winning didn’t matter at all. Had Australia taken the 10th wicket with the final margin of 11 remaining, only two women’s Test wins would have been closer. Had England scored the 12 they needed, it would have been the first Test decided by one wicket. There has never been a match drawn in the fourth innings with so few runs between the teams. New Zealand in Auckland in 1957 and England in Hyderabad in 1995 are the only other teams to draw a match nine wickets down. None of those other close finishes reached millions of people on TV and online. For all of those reasons and others besides, the ending at Manuka Oval is special.  As those viewer numbers spiked on Australian free-to-air, and as interest peaked around the world, something very obvious dawned on some cricket administrators. If you train quality players, and give them a stage when a grand finale is possible, they can put on a show that people want to see. It is only a few years since Cricket Australia under James Sutherland’s reign – while visionary in expanding the Big Bash League for women – was suggesting that even women’s 50-over cricket should be retired, with all efforts to be put into the Twenty20 version. Test cricket was too hard. Since then the pendulum has begun to swing. India’s board suddenly returning to the format in 2021 provided an important push. A couple of other boards are starting to get interested. But a lack of equality is the status quo. Among the three current competitors, women’s matches are scheduled over four days, men’s matches over five. Women get one Test on occasional tours, men play series after series. Women have no long-form cricket in domestic calendars to help them prepare, men agonise over whether their extensive domestic competitions are good enough or long enough or useful enough. The reason as ever is money. Long matches cost more to stage than short ones. More ground rental, more staff hours, more security and permits and red tape. Long matches are a harder sell to broadcasters, who have to commit more resources and give over more airtime for ad revenue that may not exceed that for a short game. A Test here and there as a token inclusion is easier to smooth into the bottom line. But this is judged in an environment where the women’s game is set up to fail. Games without enough time to reach results, where a few hours of rain can extinguish the contest. Games played on used pitches to save the cost of fresh ones, even though liveliness for bowlers at lower pace is the most important ingredient. Games for players given no chance to hone their skills in the format, asked to show up and produce their best without knowing what it is. Games so infrequent, so rare, so precious, that players are stifled when it comes to taking risks, too worried about wasting a chance to seize a chance. In a sense, none of those arguments matter. What matters is that there is no justifiable argument for why women should be confined to a narrow version of the game when men across the cricket world are not. There is no justification for making the women’s game smaller, quieter, something that takes up less space. In a sport that reveres Test cricket as the pinnacle, the ultimate challenge, the form that ordains the greats, that pinnacle cannot be closed to half the population. Anyone should be able to attempt the ascent. With any luck, Canberra’s final flurry should create movement beyond that afternoon. Yes, the finish was brought about by the constraints of a four-day game and time lost to rain. But great finishes are far more likely if we give matches time to produce them. They can happen organically instead of relying on captains to create them. They are more likely the more opportunities they have to happen. The day after the match, a father wrote to me describing his son in the nets pretending to be Alana King. We can have new storylines, new moments, new heroes. The quality of the game is there waiting for us, if we’re only prepared to let it come to life.",Sport/Sport,Ashes Test’s final flurry states clear case to open up cricket’s pinnacle to women | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/02/ashes-tests-final-flurry-states-clear-case-to-open-up-crickets-pinnacle-to-women
2/2/2022,"Former Miami Dolphins coach Brian Flores is suing three NFL teams and the league itself, which he claims “is racially segregated and is managed much like a plantation”. Flores, who is Black, was surprisingly fired by the Dolphins last month despite leading the team to back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since 2003. The lawsuit, which was filed in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday, seeks unspecified damages from the league.  Flores also depicts a Dolphins team with a troubling culture. He alleges he was offered a $100,000 bonus for every game his team lost during the 2019 season in order to secure a higher position in the 2020 NFL draft. When the team won games towards the end of the season, Flores says he was told Dolphins owner Stephen Ross was “mad” that the victories were “compromising [Miami’s] draft position.” The suit also says Flores refused to recruit a “prominent quarterback” at the end of the 2019 season as it would have compromised the league’s tampering rules. He says afterwards he was “treated with disdain and held out as someone who was noncompliant and difficult to work with” and was subsequently cast as an “an angry Black man”. The NFL has long been criticised for a lack of diversity in its coaching ranks. There is currently only one Black head coach in the NFL – the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Mike Tomlin – despite more than two-thirds of its players being Black. The lawsuit also highlights the fact that only 12% of offensive coordinators are Black, 34% of defensive coordinators and 19% of general managers. The Denver Broncos and New York Giants, who recently hired white candidates with no head coaching experience, are also named in the lawsuit. It alleges that both teams met with Flores to fulfill the Rooney Rule, which states teams must interview at least one Black candidate for head coaching vacancies, but had no intention of employing him. Flores claims two Broncos executives, including Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway, turned up an hour late for the interview and “looked completely disheveled, and it was obvious they had been drinking heavily the night before”. Flores’s lawsuit claims the Giants interviewed him despite knowing they would already appoint an white candidate. As evidence Flores includes a text message from the New England Patriots’ Bill Belichick, widely considered one of the greatest head coaches in history. Flores worked as a linebackers coach at the Patriots before taking the Dolphins job. In a text to Flores, Belichick congratulated him on getting the New York Giants job. Belichick later texted: “Sorry – I fucked this up. I double checked and misread the text. I think they are naming Brian Daboll. I’m sorry about that.” Two days later Daboll was named the new Giants head coach. “God has gifted me with a special talent to coach the game of football, but the need for change is bigger than my personal goals,” Flores said in a press release. “In making the decision to file the class action complaint today, I understand that I may be risking coaching the game that I love and that has done so much for my family and me. My sincere hope is that by standing up against systemic racism in the NFL, others will join me to ensure that positive change is made for generations to come.” The lawsuit also alluded to the power balance of the NFL, in which white owners and coaches profit from a violent and physically damaging sport in which the majority of the players are Black. The only person of colour to outright own an NFL team is the Jacksonville Jaguars’ Shahid Khan, who is Pakistani-American. Kim Pegula, who is Asian American, is a part-owner of the Buffalo Bills. “In certain critical ways, the NFL is racially segregated and is managed much like a plantation,’’ the lawsuit said. “Its 32 owners – none of whom are Black – profit substantially from the labor of NFL players, 70% of whom are Black. The owners watch the games from atop NFL stadiums in their luxury boxes, while their majority-Black workforce put their bodies on the line every Sunday, taking vicious hits and suffering debilitating injuries to their bodies and their brains while the NFL and its owners reap billions of dollars.”",Sport/Sport,Former Dolphins coach Flores sues NFL saying league is run ‘like a plantation’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/01/brian-flores-sues-nfl-dolphins-broncos-giants-racism-black-head-coaches
2/2/2022,"Google’s parent company, Alphabet, ended 2021 on another high note, reporting better than expected results in a year when it nearly doubled profits despite growing regulatory scrutiny of its business. The company reported revenues of $75.3bn for the three months ending 31 December, up 32% compared to last year, and a profit of $20.6bn, comfortably beating analysts’ expectations. Alphabet’s shares rose close to 7% in after-hours trading.  Google, the latest of the US tech giants to report earnings in what has been a rocky reporting season for some of tech’s smaller players, once again showed how powerful it remains in search, video and online advertising. The company’s advertising revenues came in at $61.2bn for the quarter, up from $46.2bn the same time last year, as it continued to benefit from a pandemic-led boom in digital advertising. Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Alphabet and Google, said: “Our deep investment in AI technologies continues to drive extraordinary and helpful experiences for people and businesses, across our most important products.” Alphabet faces a flotilla of regulatory inquiries in the US and Europe over its dominance in digital advertising.
