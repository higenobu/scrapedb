1/23/2022,"The gen-Z demographic who use TikTok may be too young to remember a time before smartphones, but one of the most popular fashion trends on the app harks back to a bygone era. Opera gloves – as worn by screen stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn and Rita Hayworth – are taking off. Videos with the hashtag have had 275,000 views on TikTok. According to a study carried out by Clothes2Order, that represents a Google search increase of 84% in the second half of 2021.  The surging interest in a clothing item that would once have been worn to an elite cultural event, the opera, has been repurposed over the years and is now being sported by popular musicians and actors. Adele, Olivia Rodrigo and Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion have worn them in videos, while Julia Fox and Euphoria’s Sydney Sweeney have worn them to events. The red carpet at the Fashion Awards in December saw attenders get behind the trend – Demi Moore, Alexa Chung and Kristen McMenamy wore opera gloves. Beyoncé, meanwhile, has made them something of a signature. At the Grammys last year, she sported leather opera gloves with matching dress. Opera gloves are on the catwalk too – at brands ranging from Valentino to Marc Jacobs, Fendi and Richard Quinn. More accessible labels, often aimed at a younger demographic, are also selling them. Heaven by Marc Jacobs, typically a collection inspired by 1990s club kids, sells dresses with gloves. Kai Collective, a brand established in London in 2016 by fashion blogger Fisayo Longe, has its popular Gaia gloves for £45. And Miscreants, set up by 29-year-old Central Saint Martins graduate Lillie Hand in 2019, has designs using velvet, feathers and bows, worn by women ranging from singer Lizzo to Joan Collins. In 2022’s iteration of this look, gloves are paired with dresses, made in matching prints. When Hand launched Miscreants, the first design was the Cupid little black dress and matching gloves. “Since then, a lot of magazines would just request the gloves,” she says. “We built on that, did detachable bows and puffs and the feathers, and it’s just got a bit out of control.” Hand believes the popularity on the red carpet has had its impact on the trend: “They’re so fashionable at the moment. And obviously every time you see a red carpet then celebrities are mainly wearing gloves. I think they’re elegant, they’re classy.” It’s this classiness – a nod to the glamour of Hollywood’s golden age – which gives them a big tick. While gloves have been worn by women for hundreds of years, opera gloves were particularly fashionable in the 1950s. Not only were they worn to the opera, but also by movie stars, and debutantes at their coming out ball and a young Princess Margaret. “I have an affinity with 50s and 60s couture and gloves are so integral to this look,” says designer Richard Quinn. “They are so elegant … it’s an interesting way to extend and finish the silhouette.” Boxsets such as The Crown and Bridgerton have also probably had their part to play in these gloves becoming popular. “They are borderline costume,” says Hand. “Since I’ve started Miscreants, I’ve noticed everybody likes to dress up.” Hand is fond of dressing up – and praises opera gloves for their adaptability, a surefire plus point for a generation not known for its attention span. “They complete the outfit,” she says. “And if you want to dress down, you can just take them off, put them in your bag.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,In love with the glove: the TikTok generation falls for a classic look ,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/23/in-love-with-the-glove-the-tiktok-generation-falls-for-a-classic-look
1/23/2022,"Margaret (Sundance stalwart Rebecca Hall) has her life in careful order. Her sleek apartment, high-powered job, chic power suits, reliable fuck buddy – it’s all precisely crafted and, most importantly, controlled.  In the opening scene, she’s doling out advice on how to deal with a toxic boyfriend to an intern impressed by her wisdom and composure. She heads home to take care of her teenage daughter. But there are slight cracks. Her married paramour is a little too interested, her daughter a little too smothered. So when a sinister figure from her past crash-lands into her life, those cracks start to deepen and Margaret starts to unravel. The figure is David (a menacing Tim Roth), the very sight of whom makes Margaret panic. He is someone to be feared, although in writer-director Andrew Semans’ bumpy thriller, the hows and whys are initially kept in the shadows. We know she wants him gone and we know she wants her daughter to stay well away but it takes until around 35 minutes in for us to know why. Why is there a tooth in her daughter’s purse? Why is she dreaming of a charred baby? The grimy details are best left secret for maximum enjoyment of the film, but David was a lover, 22 years prior, when Margaret was still a teenager. He wielded an unusual, chilling power over her and now he’s back to see if she can still be kept under his spell. When it’s working, there’s something horribly effective about Resurrection, a horror-tinged thriller that tries doubling as a drama about the long-term effects of abuse. David was able to trap an 18-year-old Margaret in a sadistic relationship, making her do things she would have otherwise balked at, creating a fragile yet intoxicating delusion where real world rules had no place. Years later, having distanced herself from that trauma, Margaret is sucked back into that headspace, a horrifying return to a dangerous place, a nightmare she woke from now seeping into her adult life. Margaret hasn’t been able to fully process what really happened (she hasn’t told a single person about it) and with David trying to control her once again she’s a maelstrom of anger and untapped violence while, chillingly, still vulnerable to David’s unhinged charm. There’s something Haneke-like about the first half, far less opaque for sure but similarly chilly. There are also echoes of Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Killing of a Sacred Deer. Hall, as one would expect, sells the hell out of this, bristling with fury and gripped by a fear not just aimed at David but at herself and what she might be capable of doing. It’s yet another top-of-her-game turn (a scene of her uncontrollably crying alone is truly shattering) but like her last Sundance thriller, the supernatural mystery The Night House, Hall gives more then she gets in return, a performance in a league far too high for Semans’ jumbled script to reach. The plot falls apart faster than Hall’s character and post-reveal we’re lost in a repetitive spiral, Semans unable to build on a grim foundation. The intriguingly unpacked psychology of the first half unravels in overly simplistic terms, a character study falling apart as it transforms into a midnight movie. It has the feeling of a short film stretched beyond its limit, with all that early tension dissipating, and while there’s certainly something jolting about the gonzo violence in the finale, it’s otherwise ineffectual. Semans chooses to end on a surreal, ambiguous note, but it’s one that feels less daring and more down to a lack of better ideas. Hall yet again is supreme, the film, yet again, less so. Resurrection is showing at the Sundance film festival with a release date yet to be announced",Arts/Film,Resurrection review – Rebecca Hall rises above misfiring thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/22/resurrection-review-rebecca-hall-rises-above-misfiring-thriller
