1/28/2022,"A string of failings may have contributed to the death of a “deeply vulnerable” law student who took her own life while being treated in a psychiatric hospital in Bristol, an inquest jury has said. Zoë Wilson, 22, had informed staff she was hearing voices in her head telling her to kill herself and 30 minutes before she died was seen by a nurse through an observation hatch looking frightened and behaving oddly but nobody went into her room to check her.  Speaking after the jury’s conclusions, Wilson’s family said that Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS trust (AWP) should face criminal charges over the case. AWP said it accepted it had fallen short in its care of Wilson. The student was described by as a brilliant young woman, deeply loved by her family. In 2018 when she was in the final year of a law degree at Exeter University her mental health deteriorated, and she developed delusional behaviour with episodes of psychosis. She returned to the family home in Bristol and in June 2018 she was admitted to hospital but discharged three months later. Her condition deteriorated again and in April 2019 she was admitted to an acute facility at the psychiatric hospital Callington Road in Bristol, remaining there until 6 June 2019 when she was transferred to the Larch ward, which caters for lower risk patients. On 17 June 2019 she told staff she was hearing voices telling her to kill herself and handed over an item that she could have used to harm herself with. She was not moved to an acute ward and other items that she could have used were not removed. At 1am on 19 June she was observed standing beside her bathroom door looking frightened but staff did not go to her. Thirty minutes later she was checked again and had harmed herself. Emergency services were called but she was pronounced dead. Giving evidence to Avon coroner’s court, the nurse who saw Wilson at 1am said he had only worked in the unit a handful of times and had not met Wilson before that night. The jury concluded that steps taken to keep her safe that night had been inadequate and also criticised communication and information sharing. In a statement, her family, said: “Zoë was a wonderful, bright, and deeply vulnerable young woman. She was on a low-risk ward even when she told staff that voices in her head were telling her to kill herself.” They called for AWP to face a criminal prosecution by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). “We will continue to fight for justice in her name,” they said. “She will never be forgotten.” Tony Murphy of Bhatt Murphy solicitors, who represent the family, said: “The family now await the CQC’s investigation into the trust. Time is of the essence as the three-year anniversary of Zoë’s death approaches in June. “ Selen Cavcav, senior caseworker at the charity INQUEST, said: “Zoe’s escalating mental health crisis should have rung alarm bells for the clinicians and other staff who were in charge of care.” Dr Sarah Constantine, medical director at Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS trust said: “I would like to express my sincere condolences to the Wilson family. We accept the jury’s findings and recognise that in this instance we did not do everything that we could for Zoë.” + In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

1/28/2022,"Sue Gray may hold the fate of the prime minister in her hands – but the senior civil servant has been given extra time to help choose the next head of Ofcom, after the government once again extended the deadline to apply for the job. When not investigating who was dragging suitcases of booze into Downing Street for lockdown-busting parties, Gray is also leading the increasingly farcical interview process to find a new chair of the media regulator. This began almost two years ago, when the former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre was offered the job by Boris Johnson “over a rather sad bottle of wine” as part of a government bid to install right-leaning figures in key public roles.  According to Dacre, the prime minister verbally promised him the job regulating the UK’s broadcast news and social media websites. The only issue was that Dacre would need to go through the formalities of a vetting process before his appointment was rubber-stamped by ministers. Yet Dacre unexpectedly flunked the interview process, causing the government to abandon the recruitment process altogether and advertise the job again. This time ministers put the noted Whitehall fixer Gray in charge of the interview panel – along with two individuals with ties to the Conservative party. One individual with knowledge of the recruitment process suggested Gray had been put in charge to ensure that Dacre was approved at the second time of asking. Yet the former Daily Mail editor then blindsided the government in December by withdrawing his application without telling ministers. With other candidates put off applying for a job that they perceived to be a stitch-up, the government has now reopened applications yet again. The last time the £142,000 three-day-a-week job was advertised, only nine individuals applied. The delay means that Ofcom has been without a permanent chair since December 2020 at a crucial time in its history, as it prepares to regulate social media platforms. It is also having knock-on effects elsewhere in the media industry, with a backlog of Ofcom-approved appointments now building up at institutions such as Channel 4. Dacre was uncomfortable with scrutiny of his potential appointment to Ofcom, writing last year that the Guardian’s “hysterical obsession with little old me is not just unhinged, it’s psychotic”. He said he had decided to withdraw from the recruitment process because “the toxic hatred of Brexit that is so palpable among the people who really run this country meant I would not be able to do justice to myself, or Ofcom or the public it’s meant to serve”. The Conservative MP Julian Knight, who chairs the culture select committee, said recruitment process for the chair of Ofcom “would put a reality TV series to shame”. “In an unexpected twist to the plot, would-be candidates have been given an extra seven days to apply. Not content with the outcome of the initial round of interviews, the DCMS Department restarted the appointments process using specially employed headhunters to get a better field of candidates, only to see a favourite walk away. Now, that better field of candidates is not enough. The word shambles has begun to look like an understatement. “Anyone out there who’s still interested, there’s still time to apply – the new deadline is 23.59 next Wednesday.”",News/Media,Parties inquisitor Sue Gray also in charge of finding Ofcom chair,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/27/parties-inquisitor-sue-gray-also-in-charge-of-finding-ofcom-chair
1/28/2022,"An already weakened England Twenty20 team in Barbados will play the deciding double-header against West Indies this weekend without their captain, Eoin Morgan, who withdrew from Wednesday’s third match after reporting a thigh strain in the warm-up and has now been ruled out of the rest of the tour. Moeen Ali, who stepped in to lead the side during their 20-run defeat, will remain in the role as England attempt to overturn a 2-1 deficit in the final two games of the series. Morgan’s injury is described as “relatively minor” and is unlikely to have a long-term impact, with England’s white-ball side not scheduled to play between the conclusion of this tour and the three one-day internationals in the Netherlands in June.  Tom Banton, whose 39-ball 73 in a losing cause on Wednesday has underlined his status as one of the rising stars of the English game, has put his form down to his decision to spend the buildup to the series working with his coaches at Somerset rather than travelling to Australia for the Big Bash League. “That might have made the difference,” he said. “The way cricket is, there’s ups and downs and you’ve just got to ride that wave. I went to the IPL and Big Bash [at the end of 2019], and it was amazing. But then I didn’t really get time to be at home and work on my batting. I’ve got to be a bit more careful about what I do during the winter and plan out my year a bit better, just to make sure I’m getting work in back at Somerset, still ticking over with training.” At the end of 2020 Banton pulled out of the BBL, though more because of concerns over the impact of bubbles than to spend more time at Tauton. “After a time, it just takes its toll,” he said. “I want to be able to live my life and not be stuck in a hotel. I want to see my friends and be at home, see my family, as well as playing cricket. In the end it was too much for me. I pulled out of Big Bash because you had to [quarantine] in a hotel room for two weeks, and it’s just crazy to think that people would even do that.” Banton has turned down opportunities in the Pakistan Super League and in the Indian Premier League after this series in favour of returning to Somerset and working towards the domestic season. “I’ll be in England and I’ll be at home, I won’t be sat in a hotel the whole time and I’ll be able to go out and live a normal life,” he said. “At the end of last summer I went on a group holiday with the Somerset boys to Spain, which I probably haven’t been on in about five years, and I think things like that are just really important, to get away from cricket.” In many ways Banton is in an unenviable position as a white-ball opener and potential wicketkeeper labouring in the shadow of Jos Buttler, auditioning for a role that does not exist. “He’s probably the best in the world,” Banton said. “I’m quite good mates with Jos and it’s weird because I look up to him and now I get to play with him and it’s awesome. I definitely want to follow in his footsteps. Obviously the team is so strong and I’m not going to fit in the strongest team at the moment. I’m just trying my best to one day hopefully be able to cement my position. I’m not really thinking too much about the squad – it’s just good to be here.”",Sport/Sport,Eoin Morgan ruled out of England’s decisive final T20s in West Indies,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/27/tom-banton-blast-in-bridgetown-latest-evidence-burgeoning-talent-england-west-indies-t20
1/28/2022,"Boris Johnson: Where are we off to? Special adviser: Wales.  Johnson: Why? Special adviser: Why not? You haven’t been there for a while and the diary is empty now that the Sue Gray report has been delayed. Plus, it’s far enough away from London for you to be unable to make a statement to parliament today even if the report was to be delivered. Johnson: Makes sense. Maybe if I make myself scarce every day for the next week everyone will just forget about Sue Gray. Special adviser: I don’t think Sue Gray is going to forget about Sue Gray. Or the rest of the country. Plus, there’s a limit to how obstructive we can be seen to have been. So try not to think about the report today and use the time while we’re travelling to call Tory MPs to shore up support in case there’s a no confidence vote. Johnson: Is that Archie? Tory MP: No, it’s Andy. Johnson: Of course you are. Good to speak to you Sandy. It’s the Suspect here. I mean, the prime minister. I’m just calling to find out how you are … Tory MP: To be honest, I’ve had better months … Johnson: Me too. Tory MP: Look, I’ll admit when I first heard about all the parties inside No 10 I was a bit shocked. But now I’ve calmed down and had a bit of time to reflect, I can see you deserve to be cut a bit of slack … Johnson: That’s very good of you. I was working tremendously hard and it can be so easy to walk into one’s garden to find trestle tables full of food and dozens of people getting pissed and conclude you were still at a Covid test-and-trace briefing. Not to mention the shock of being ambushed by a cake in the cabinet room while my wife and the interior designer – among others – sang Happy Birthday. Tory MP: That must have been terrifying. As I said, I have no problem with you lying. We all knew you were a pathological liar when we elected you party leader so it would be totally unreasonable of us to expect you to change. The trouble is that my inbox has been full of constituents who don’t feel the same way. They are furious that you have obviously misled parliament and taken the country for granted. Johnson: I can assure you I have done nothing wrong and that I’m the innocent victim in all this … Tory MP: Yes, yes. Save all this for the police. I believe you. But what are you going to do to put things right? Johnson: What would you like me to do? Tory MP: Well, you could get rid of that smirk for a start. And then you could try being a bit more Conservative … Johnson: What could be more Conservative than having brought the government to a complete standstill with a “one rule for us and another rule for the little people” scandal? It’s a classic of the genre. Tory MP: Good point, well made. But maybe you could have another look at the national insurance increase in April? Johnson: We are the party of low taxes except when we are raising them. Can I just say that it is all Rishi Sunak’s fault. He gave me bad advice and is to blame for making me do it … Tory MP: What does that mean exactly? Johnson: I’m not entirely sure. I’m fully behind the rise until the moment when I find the whole party is about to dump me, at which point I will do a reverse ferret. Or maybe I won’t … Tory MP: I see. Moving on. What are you going to do about Brexit? Johnson: What would you like me to do? Tory MP: Could we try diverging further from the EU? Johnson: Even if it’s pointless and more expensive for British business? Tory MP: Especially if it’s pointless and more expensive for British business. We need a futile gesture to show that we have really taken back control. Johnson: OK, if you insist. It’s no skin off my nose if GDP tanks. Just so long as I’m still in a job. Tory MP: That’s more like it. Now what else have you got planned? Johnson: Well, in the short-term, I’m planning on going to Australia in the February recess … Tory MP: What for? Johnson: No reason, really. Just Liz Truss said the private jet was amazing. Tory MP: That’s just what voters need to see. You sunning yourself, while the rest of the country freezes its nuts off. Johnson: Must go. I’ve just reached Wales. Just remember you’re in line for a ministerial post at the next reshuffle. And that if you don’t support me then funding to your constituency will be cut. Goodbye. Lovely to chat. ITV: Could you explain why everyone in Whitehall seems to think you personally intervened to prioritise the rescue of animals over people from Afghanistan?

And surely no one else but you could have organised such a flight at such short notice. Harrison: You definitely did. Johnson: I didn’t. Just remember your place. Your job is – like everyone else who works for me – is to lose your job when required. Everything is about me. Harrison: You’re right. You definitely did nothing wrong.

1/28/2022,"A five-year-old boy who was fatally stabbed at his home in Coventry has been named as David-Mario Lazar. The boy, known to his family as Mario, was found with serious injuries at his home in the Earlsdon area of the city just before 6pm on Tuesday.  A 49-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of his murder has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act. She is known to the family and David-Mario was in her care at the time of the incident, police said. In a statement, his parents, Cristina and Dorinel, said he was “the most beautiful child in the world”. “He was a very happy boy. He was always smiling from when he woke up to when he went to sleep,” they said. “He had so much energy. He loved to dance and sing. He is all of our hearts, all our love and is everything to both of us.” Despite the best efforts of police officers and paramedics to save him, David-Mario was pronounced dead at the scene. A postmortem examination has confirmed he died from a stab wound. West Midlands police said the property on Poplar Road remains cordoned off while officers carry out a forensic examination. They are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. Supt Ronan Tyrer, from Coventry police, said: “Our investigation continues into the desperately sad death of David-Mario. Our specialist officers are supporting his parents and we cannot comprehend the grief they must feel. Our thoughts are with them. “David-Mario’s school has been informed and they are contacting parents and carers of their pupils.

1/28/2022,"Exeter Chiefs say they have received a “very positive” response to the decision to replace their Native American-themed branding with a new club logo from this summer. The club’s “visual identity” will now be based on a local Celtic chief inspired by the Dumnonii tribe, who were based in Devon, Cornwall and part of Somerset in the Iron Age. The change, as confirmed by the Guardian in November, follows criticism of the club’s existing branding and accusations of “cultural appropriation”. Now, in common with several north American professional sports teams, the club’s badge is being revised and will bear the helmeted image of a Celtic warrior, a nod to the heritage of the surrounding region.  According to the club, the rebrand reflects the Celtic helmets worn in and around 300 BC which were inspired by the La Tène art style popular in Britain at that time. The city of Exeter was previously known as Isca Dumnoniorum which translates as “Watertown of the Dumnonii”. The “Chiefs” moniker, however, is to remain unaltered. West Country rugby sides have long dubbed their first team “the Chiefs”, with Exeter having done so as far back as 1908. Discussions are ongoing regarding other associated branding, including the Wigwam Bar and the totem pole which stands in the reception area at Sandy Park, but the Guardian understands they are also poised to be replaced. Exeter’s current branding has been in existence since 1999 but the Chiefs’ chairman, Tony Rowe, said the club’s board had now decided it was time for a change which, he estimated, will cost in the region of £500,000. “We are excited to welcome in the next era of rugby within Exeter,” said Rowe. “As a rugby club we have been willing to listen, we have consulted far and wide, and now we are ready to invoke change. This is a new direction for our great club, but equally it’s an exciting vision that I’ve no doubt will propel us onwards and upwards over time.” Rowe had previously told the Guardian that he felt the club’s membership would resist any changes but Exeter did retire their regular mascot Big Chief in 2020 after accepting it could be viewed as disrespectful. Some are already comparing the facial features of the Celtic warrior to, variously, Jack Nowell, the 12th-century sultan Saladin and the TV presenter Rylan Clark but the pressure group Exeter Chiefs for Change has welcomed the switch. “Our faith in the club has been restored today and we are overwhelmed with excitement at the new identity that celebrates Devon’s own rich history and gives us even more reason to be proud of our club and our region,” said a spokesperson. “Indigenous peoples have long said they are not respected nor honoured by the Native imagery … so we’re relieved those concerns have been listened to and acted upon.” The social media platform TikTok, meanwhile, has signed a four-year deal to partner with the Six Nations. The women’s tournament, which has not previously had a title sponsor, will now be known as the TikTok Six Nations. To date there have been more than 5.1bn views of rugby content on TikTok.",Sport/Sport,Exeter Chiefs replace Native-American branding with new Celtic logo,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/27/exeter-chiefs-replace-native-american-branding-with-new-celtic-logo
1/28/2022,"British lawyers have cast doubt on the strength of Prince Andrew’s defence to Virginia’s Giuffre’s lawsuit and whether it can help him settle the case, thereby avoiding a “disastrous” court trial. In papers filed with the US district court on Wednesday, Andrew denied sexually abusing Giuffre when she was a minor and also sought to bar his accuser’s claim on grounds including the time elapsed since the alleged offences – despite a New York statute having extended the window for child victim claims – and her “wrongful conduct”.  Much of the document was made up of repetitive responses either denying allegations made by Giuffre in the complaint, or stating that Andrew “lacks sufficient information to admit or deny”. Nick Goldstone, head of dispute resolution at Ince Gordon Dadds LLP, said: “There are certain things where it is ludicrous for him to say he has insufficient information to admit or deny. Six months on, he has at least put forward a defence and that is interesting, but it does appear to be a boilerplate exercise, rather over-enthusiastically deployed.” Among the allegations from Giuffre’s complaint that Andrew said he could not admit or deny were that: Andrew and convicted sex-trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell have been photographed at numerous social events together. Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida in 2008 to the charge of procuring a minor for prostitution. Andrew had been on Epstein’s private plane and stayed at some of his homes. The infamous photograph depicts Andrew, Giuffre and Maxwell at Maxwell’s home. Andrew admitted in the disastrous 2019 Newsnight interview to having been on Epstein’s jet and having stayed at several of his properties, while Epstein’s conviction is a matter of public record. The prince’s court papers also raised eyebrows for their denial that Maxwell, whom Andrew met when she was at university, was a close friend. Richard Spafford, partner at Reed Smith, said: “It is possible to have met someone at university 40 years ago, but not be close friends with them later and that’s perfectly reasonable but I think it’s likely to be an issue in the case and it’s an issue on which there will be argument and discovery and I suspect that the plaintiff side won’t accept what Prince Andrew is saying.” The defences in the court papers contain no reference to previous claims made by Andrew that he cannot sweat (Giuffre had alleged that he got sweaty on a dancefloor with her in 2001) and that he visited a Pizza Express on the day of the claimed sexual encounter with Giuffre. Spafford said it was “interesting” they were not in the document, as might have been expected, and suggested that may mean they are not points his legal team mean to pursue. He described the document as a “standard approach” in that it contained forceful denials “but that’s frequently followed by an attempt to settle”. Mark Stephens, a partner at Howard Kennedy and expert in reputation management said: “My read of it is that he’s taking an aggressive position in litigation, is indicating that he’s prepared to go through with it to improve his leverage for settlement.” With the Queen’s platinum jubilee approaching next week, Stephens did not rule out an attempt at a speedy settlement but he said, following the prince’s filing, it was still clear that Giuffre’s lawyer, David Boies, “holds most of the cards”. Boies has said his client would be unlikely to be interested in a “purely financial settlement” but lawyers who spoke to the Guardian suggested it was imperative for Andrew to settle. Goldstone said of the filing by Andrew’s lawyers: “It’s a ‘[throw in everything but the] kitchen sink’ exercise which I think is designed probably to show the world that he’s ready for a fight, whilst, in my view, he clearly isn’t ready for a fight. He shouldn’t be volunteered to be cross-examined on this pleading because it’s a nightmare. It’s not a defence or a response document that would fill me with fear if I was acting for the claimant. There has to be a way out of this for Andrew that will avoid a jury trial because a jury trial is a complete disaster.”",News/UK news,Lawyers question strength of Prince Andrew’s response to lawsuit,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/27/lawyers-question-strength-of-prince-andrews-response-to-lawsuit
1/28/2022,"The west is planning to incentivise the Taliban to abide by their promise to allow girls to be educated by providing funding for teachers’ salaries only in provinces in which the pledge is met. The Taliban claimed this week the group would allow girls of secondary school age to be educated from March, the start of the next school term. Sceptical diplomats said they would need more than verbal assurances, with physical and budgetary evidence of preparations being required.  If no credible nationwide pledge was made or implemented, western diplomats said a plan to fund teachers’ salaries would go ahead only in those provinces where girls were allowed to attend school. Some provinces have been less repressive about the rights of women. The salary funds would come from the World Bank-administered Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), the single largest source of aid to Afghanistan before the Taliban took over in August. Worth £1.5bn, the fund has been frozen since then. Next month, the World Bank executive board is likely to discuss how more cash can be released from the fund, not just to help with humanitarian work but, for the first time since August, with the payment of key workers in health and education. As reports of dire humanitarian need mounted in December, £280m was released but it was mainly sent to the World Food Program and Unicef, and was not spent on salaries. Accused of letting Afghanistan fall apart, diplomats say there is a growing consensus that the west needs to go beyond conventional humanitarian aid and to fund teachers’ salaries, but only if girls are not being excluded from education. London and other capitals have been pushing for a larger tranche of ARTF funding to be released, but are waiting on a World Bank board paper, which will map out how cash could be released for salaries in education, health and agricultural production without reaching the Taliban. The west refuses to recognise the group, and the US has imposed sanctions on many of their leaders. The key proposal is for UN agencies, such as Unicef, or the International Red Cross to produce lists of frontline health and education workers so payments can be sent to their bank accounts directly. One source stressed the plan was for the medium term, adding that the Taliban were “slowly realising that this is the only way this will work”. The cash for key workers is only one aspect of how the humanitarian crisis is worsened by sanctions. On Thursday, the Norwegian Refugee Council became the latest aid agency to say it is nearly impossible to channel money into Afghanistan due to the state of the banks and fears among western financial institutions that transactions will fall foul of US Treasury sanctions. Before Christmas the UN security council passed a resolution aiming to protect bank transactions for humanitarian purposes from the sanctions regime. Since then the US Treasury has issued six general licences to allow such payments to go ahead, and is in discussion with Citibank, the main bank that handled Afghan transactions, to reassure its officials it will not be sanctioned if it returns to the market. The UK is also bringing the UN’s humanitarian exemption into UK sanctions law, and is providing £280m to Afghanistan this year. US officials are talking to the Afghan Central Bank to discuss how it can be made more independent and credible. Western officials say it is a misunderstanding to regard theACB’S £8bn in frozen reserves as a potential source of humanitarian funding since it is seed capital for the bank, and if handed back to the Taliban would amount to diplomatic recognition of the group. On Tuesday, the Asia Development Bank board released £405m, mainly for the Afghan agricultural sector.",News/World news,West plans to tie Afghan teacher aid to girls’ education pledge,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/27/west-plans-to-tie-afghan-teacher-aid-to-girls-education-pledge
1/28/2022,"Greece’s main opposition leader, Alexis Tsipras, has filed a motion of no confidence in the government, saying its bungled response to a winter blizzard this week showed it was no longer fit for office. Submitting the censure motion, the leftist former prime minister, said Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s administration was “the worst the country has known” since the collapse of military rule in 1974.  “Because we have the obligation to turn rage and despair into a force of political change, my conviction is that this government has to go as soon as possible,” he told MPs when he filed the motion on Thursday. “It has to go before it is too late – too late for society, the country and democracy.” Thousands of motorists were stranded in their cars as a snowstorm of rare intensity swept over Greece on Monday, and there were blackouts across Athens, forcing the army to evacuate trapped drivers as public anger mounted. Mitsotakis apologised for the state’s lack of preparedness, accepting “mistakes and shortcomings” in its handling of a weather event that had been forecast days earlier. Tsipras accused the centre-right government of also mismanaging other emergencies, singling out last summer’s wildfires and the coronavirus pandemic. This week’s blizzard, which led to almost the entire public sector being shut down, had “buried hopes” of it ever learning from its mistakes, he said. At more than 22,000 deaths from a population of 11 million, Greece has one of the highest Covid-19 fatality rates in the EU. Tsipras’s move means there will be three days of parliamentary debate. But analysts dismissed the possibility of Mitsotakis, who controls a majority in the 300-seat parliament, losing a vote scheduled for Sunday. The government, which has been in office since July 2019, said the motion offered an opportunity for it to outline its achievements on multiple fronts. “It is a tactical move by Tsipras at a time when he and his Syriza party are losing popularity because of a resurgent centre-left,” said Giorgos Kyrtsos, an MEP with the ruling New Democracy, referring to the reanimated Kinal party. Yet Kyrtsos, who has also been a vocal critic of the government’s policies, said it was clear that trust in Mitsotakis’s “new managerial style”, even among diehard supporters of the Harvard-trained technocrat, was starting to wane. “The perception of the government is beginning to change,” he said, expressing consternation over the “excessive control” it had attempted to exert over the media. “Nobody expects it to lose the vote, but the perception that it can solve problems was, I think, lost in the snow.”",News/World news,Greek government faces confidence vote after botched blizzard response,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/27/greek-government-faces-confidence-vote-after-botched-blizzard-response
1/28/2022,"A man has been jailed after admitting harassing England’s chief medical officer, Sir Chris Whitty, by filming him with a phone against his will. Footage of the incident last June, which was shared widely on social media, was shown at the trial of Jonathan Chew, 24, at Westminster magistrates court.  It showed Chew, alongside Lewis Hughes, jeering at Whitty and holding him. Hughes was given a suspended sentence last year. But the district judge Paul Goldspring handed Chew an eight-week sentence and ordered him to pay £1,058 in costs and compensation. Chew, from Chelmsford in Essex, whistled when the custodial sentence was read out. He was also reprimanded by the judge for vaping while the costs were ordered. “Are you smoking? You are not allowed to vape in court,” Goldspring said. Explaining the costs, the judge said: “I wouldn’t normally impose costs as well as an immediate custodial sentence but I do so because your contempt for these proceedings has been breathtaking.” Chew sang “West Ham till I die” as he was led away. For the defence, Rabah Kherbane argued in mitigation that Chew had learning difficulties, including ADHD and “delayed maturity”, and was autistic. Goldspring said those factors were not significant in sentencing. He said: “Your behaviour doesn’t give me any confidence that your remorse is genuine. I accept that you suffer from autism, learning disabilities and some other issues, including a lack of maturity. “I accept that initially, at least, your intention was not hostile, intimidatory or humiliation. I’m afraid it very quickly turned into all of those things.” He added: “You and Mr Hughes came across Professor, now Sir, Christopher Whitty, and it appears that you have a penchant for having your photograph, or selfie, to be taken with people who you consider to be celebrities. “You asked for a selfie and once you were told no, it was obvious even to you, with autism, that Prof Whitty was very uncomfortable, slightly intimidated, perhaps humiliated by you filming him. You persisted and you placed your hands on him.” The judge praised Whitty for the “great professionalism under a great deal of pressure” he had shown during the Covid pandemic. Addressing Chew, he said of Whitty: “He didn’t choose to be in the public. He is entitled to go about his daily life without the fear of someone like you. “I also sentence you on the basis that there should be a deterrent for targeting those who do not choose to be in public eye, from behaviour like this.” He added: “Your offending in my view very clearly crosses the custody threshold. You targeted him in the sense that you recognised him from the TV. “Secondly, although you did not upload the video, you were complicit by sharing; you added to the humiliation. In my view that was your intention.” The court heard that Chew had a long criminal record that included five offences against a person, and three public order offences. Goldspring said: “You were on licence at the time, and you have a significant and I would say appalling criminal record. And in particular, you have relevant convictions for public order offences.” Goldspring also chided Chew for obstructing police officers. He said: “You chose to give your brother’s name. Unfortunately, that wasn’t something you put right immediately or indeed ever. “Eventually you were caught up with because you and your mother gave an interview to the Sun newspaper. You persisted with your not guilty plea in relation to overwhelming evidence of obstruction all the way up until the day of trial.” Chew was given two weeks in prison for obstructing the course of justice, to run currently with his eight-week sentence. Hughes, 24, of Romford in east London, earlier pleaded guilty to a charge of assault by beating and was sentenced last July.

1/28/2022,"Record numbers of women are reaching the age of 30 child-free, new official figures have shown. More than half (50.1%) of women in England and Wales born in 1990 were without a child when they turned 30 in 2020, the first generation to do so, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).  That is almost three times higher than the lowest number of women ever to be child-free at 30 – 17.9% of those born in 1941. At the same time the average number of children women have by the time they reach 30 has fallen to its lowest-ever level (0.96). The latest ONS data on childbirth also show that, while two-child families remain the norm, growing numbers of women are never becoming mothers or having only one baby. The statistics confirm the major shift towards older motherhood that has taken place over recent years, that experts have linked to advances by women in the workplace, the cost of rearing children and people taking longer than before to establish significant relationships. “We continue to see a delay in childbearing, with women born in 1990 becoming the first cohort where half of the women remain childless by their 30th birthday”, said Amanda Sharfman of the ONS’s centre for ageing and demography. “Levels of childlessness by age 30 have been steadily rising since a low of 18% for women born in 1941. Lower levels of fertility in those currently in their 20s indicate that this trend is likely to continue,” she added. Among women who turned 45 last year almost one in five – 18% – were without children, a big rise compared with the 13% of their mothers’ generation who did not become a parent. The number of women having only one child has also risen sharply in that age group, from 13% among their mothers’ generation to 17% last year. Mothers who turned 45 last year – the ONS deems childbearing age to end the day before a women reaches 46 – had on average 1.92 children. That was the same number as those born a year earlier but was less than the 2.08 offspring that their mothers had. The most common age at which women born in 1975 gave birth was 31, nine years later than their mothers did at the age of 22. Average family size has fallen. While the commonest family unit remains those with two children, their number is falling. Among women in that age group 37% gave birth twice compared with the 44% of their mothers’ generation – women born in 1949 – who did so. Just over a quarter (27%) had three or more children while 17% had just one son or daughter. “The average number of children born to a woman has been below two for women born since the late 1950s,” added Sharfman. The lowest average was 1.89 children among women born in 1972 and 1973. The ONS believes that the average number of children is likely to stay at or above 1.92, based on current levels of cumulative fertility seen in women born in the mid-to-late 1970s. “While two-child families are still the most common, women who have recently completed their childbearing are more likely than their mothers’ generation to have only one child or none at all,” Sharfman added. Dr Jo Mountfield, a consultant obstetrician and vice-president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “Over the last few decades, there has been a general trend of women choosing to have babies later than women a generation ago, and a growing trend of women having fewer or no children. This is due to a range of social, professional and financial reasons. “Choosing when to have children is a personal decision that should be fully respected and supported, as should the decision to have no children. With the advances of technology and medicine, including access to contraception, fertility treatments and egg freezing, women have more control and options on how and when to have children.” However, young people should bear in mind that natural fertility starts to decline from the age of 35 and later pregnancy involves an increased risk of complications, including it taking longer to get pregnant, fertility problems and a higher risk of miscarriage, she added.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Record numbers of women reach 30 child-free in England and Wales,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/27/women-child-free-30-ons
1/28/2022,"The Democratic Unionist party has set 21 February as a fresh deadline for the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, to find a solution to the dispute over the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol. In her first visit to Northern Ireland, Truss, who inherited Brexit negotiations from Lord Frost at Christmas, met the DUP’s Paul Givan and Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill, first minister and deputy first minister respectively.  Givan said the government must take unilateral action if an agreed position cannot be reached with the EU by the fourth week of February. But Sinn Féin has said any attempt to trigger article 16 of the protocol would cause more uncertainty in Northern Ireland. Truss said she wants to strike a deal on the protocol that works for everyone in the region. “We are making progress. We’re having constructive talks. I want to make significant progress by February. That’s important but it’s important that we secure the support of all of the communities in Northern Ireland, including the unionist community.” Sources close to the foreign secretary said she was in “listening mode” and told party leaders of her “commitment to securing changes to the protocol that defend peace and stability, protect sovereignty of decision-making for all, and ensure free flow of GB-NI goods”. They added that she believed a deal could be done and she was looking for “durable, practical solutions”. Earlier this week Truss and the European Commission vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, said they hoped a deal could be done by the end of February before the electioneering for the May Stormont elections. Speaking after the meeting, Givan said there has to be progress made “imminently” in negotiations. He said: “Liz Truss has indicated that she is making progress with the European Union and obviously 21 February is a very significant date in terms of what progress will have been made or not made.” A meeting of the joint working committee on the withdrawal agreement takes place on that date. He added: “I pressed the foreign secretary about the need to take action in the absence of there being progress and an agreed outcome with the European Union. The foreign secretary indicated that the UK government does stand ready to take action, she mentioned the use of article 16, but she prefers to get an agreed position with the European Union.” He added: “I have emphasised the absolute critical nature of that progress being made, because the protocol is causing instability to these institutions, it is damaging our economy and this is having a real impact on Northern Ireland. “So, we need to see that progress, we need to see that imminently, and we also need to see action taken by the UK government if there isn’t an agreed outcome.” The meeting came a day after the DUP’s leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said he could not guarantee Givan would still be in position next week. It also came just hours after the SDLP criticised the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office for “playing politics” with the Northern Ireland protocol in an official video on the negotiations.

1/28/2022,"What do Melania Trump’s wide-brimmed white hat, a painting of her wearing the hat and an NFT of an animated version of the hat have in common? They were all put up for auction by the former first lady – and as of early Wednesday, failed to rake in the target price of a $250,000 opening bid.  Trump announced earlier this month that she would auction off the autographed hat, which she wore to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his wife during an official state visit in 2018. The auction also included a watercolor painting of herself wearing the hat and a non-fungible token, or NFT, of the painting. She insisted that all bids be made in Solana tokens, a cryptocurrency. When the auction concluded on Wednesday there were only five bids on the items, each around the minimum requirement of 1,800 Solana tokens. Although the minimum number of tokens was met, a steep dive in the crypto market over the last two weeks resulted in the final bid being approximately $170,000 – about $80,000 short of the opening bid threshold. “The auction winner will receive a personalized letter from Mrs. Trump, accompanying the hat and watercolor on paper and certifying authenticity. The NFT will be minted on the Solana Blockchain,” said a statement released earlier this month from the Office of Melania Trump. It said a “portion” of the proceeds derived from the auction would be given to provide people “who have been in the foster care community with access to computer science and technology education”. The auction collection, named “Head of State”, marks Trump’s second high-profile venture into NFTs and cryptocurrency.

1/28/2022,"John Harris rightly draws attention to the shocking levels of public distrust in politicians (Distrust, discord and disengagement will be the disgraceful legacy of Boris Johnson, 24 January), but there is another insidious and dangerous social effect about which little has been said: the impact on the young. As a teacher with more than 40 years’ experience, I know only too well that children and young people tend to be much more profoundly influenced by the things that they see adults in authority do as opposed to the things adults tell them to do. I have rarely seen a political story resonate so strongly with teenagers (even those with no interest in the news) as the scandal about lockdown parties. And while the rights and wrongs of the matter may be clear to them, many will learn the lesson that if you are in trouble, the right thing to do is to lie your way out of it, that if you are suspected of wrongdoing you should let others take the blame, and that it is acceptable to ask other people to do things that you are not prepared to do yourself.Kevin NaghtenLondon   Thank you, John Harris, for your article. A lifetime of intellectual, cultural and emotional attachment to democratic norms and values makes me an unlikely supporter of hereditary monarchy or of unelected legislators. So it is an uncomfortable experience to adjust that attachment and support. I am obliged to respect the Queen, for eschewing the offered privilege of relaxed rules for a funeral, and the House of Lords, for ejecting the authoritarian additions to the policing bill. Both have modelled resistance to the principles and behaviour of the democratically elected representatives forming the UK government.

1/28/2022,"The time warp of the cricket establishment was vividly exposed in Barney Ronay’s article (Tin-eared county chairmen show why English cricket is in trouble, 25 January), but the origins of these attitudes are much deeper. Excellence in cricket requires more investment than most other sports; one essential is a well-prepared pitch and level outfield, not least in order to ensure basic safety when coping with a hard cricket ball at speed. It also requires a coaching programme to develop the complex skills needed for young players to thrive. Alas, nowadays few state secondary schools have the financial capacity to devote to the expense required and very little formal cricket is played in state schools. This means that many interested youngsters, the potential expert cricketers of the future, have no chance to acquire the basic skills, and few come into the county teams’ academies.  A quick glance at the list of players currently on Yorkshire’s books shows that of the 27 educated in the UK, almost all came through public or direct grant schools. No doubt there would be the same proportion of skilled players coming through state schools into the county game, but they are absent through no fault of their own. The knock-on effect is that the elitist public school culture, which has produced the archaic attitudes of so many in the cabinet and of many Conservative MPs, is also embedded in the cricket establishment, as so clearly set out by Ronay. To change this requires a deliberate investment in the game in state schools to broaden the pool of players.Michael MeadowcroftLeeds  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The result was that in 2010 a joint constabulary and prison inspectorate report found great improvements, partly because of “an active body of independent custody visitors”. ICVs were introduced as a citizens’ oversight of police stations in the Scarman report.

The restoration of community engagement is urgently needed if custody practices of the sort suffered by Konstancja Duff are to be eradicated (Rights groups call for statutory inquiry into misogyny in the Met, 25 January).

1/28/2022,"The World Health Organization chief has backed the veteran rock star Neil Young in his dispute with the music streaming behemoth Spotify, thanking the musician for “standing up against misinformation and inaccuracies” around Covid vaccinations. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s director general, tweeted that “we all have a role to play to end this pandemic and infodemic” – in particular social media platforms.  Spotify has begun removing Young’s music from its platform after an ultimatum issued by the star earlier this week to the company. Referring to controversial podcasts by Joe Rogan hosted by Spotify, Young said: “They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.” Spotify swiftly made its choice, triggering an almighty storm over anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, cancel culture and the policing of social media. Many of Young’s fans and supporters of his stance called for a boycott of the streaming platform, and for other artists to follow his lead. “I stand with Neil Young” and “#CancelSpotify” became rallying calls on social media on Thursday. The actor and activist Mia Farrow tweeted: “Wow @Spotify you chose to keep creepy, dangerous liar Joe Rodan over the magnificent Neil Young ?” There was no immediate sign of other big names in the music industry siding with Young against Spotify – an indication perhaps of its market dominance. Between 2010 and 2020, Spotify’s share of the US music market rose from 7% to 83%. The controversy began with an open letter from Young to his manager and record label, posted earlier this week but since taken down. The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, hosted exclusively on Spotify and with an estimated audience of 11 million, had “tremendous influence”, the letter said. “Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines – potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them,” Young wrote. The streaming platform had a responsibility to “mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform.” He instructed his manager to “let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform. They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.” In a statement issued on Wednesday, Spotify responded by saying: “We regret Neil’s decision to remove his music from Spotify, but hope to welcome him back soon.” The company also said it had “detailed content policies in place and we’ve removed over 20,000 podcast episodes relating to Covid since the start of the pandemic”. Rogan signed a $100m deal in 2020 giving Spotify exclusive rights to his show, which features conversations with guests on a range of issues, including politics, comedy, conspiracies and cancel culture. It is Spotify’s most popular podcast and one of the biggest in the world. Three months ago, the company reported its revenue had grown 27% over the previous year, and it named the Joe Rogan Experience as a factor in the double digit growth in its podcast business. Last year, Rogan was criticised by the White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci for suggesting that young, healthy Americans did not need to be vaccinated against Covid. The comment was “incorrect”, said Fauci. In the past few weeks, hundreds of scientists and medical experts have signed an open letter to Spotify, saying that Rogan had “repeatedly spread misleading and false claims on his podcast, provoking distrust in science and medicine” and had “spread a number of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories”. They highlighted a three-hour episode of Rogan’s podcast, in which Robert Malone, a scientist and vaccine sceptic, claimed that “a third of the population” had “become hypnotised” through “mass formation psychosis” as if in Nazi Germany and “totally wrapped up in whatever Fauci in the mainstream media feeds them”. Despite Spotify’s claim that it has removed thousands of podcasts relating to Covid since the start of the pandemic, Rogan has repeatedly said the company has not policed his content. “Spotify has asked me to change nothing. They’ve never – they’ve been amazing. I’m very happy with them, I’m very happy,” he said last year. Young, 76, whose hits include Heart of Gold, Harvest Moon, Helpless and Keep on Rockin’ in the Free World, has a long if inconsistent political history. His album, Living With War, released in the aftermath of the Iraq war, called for the impeachment of President George W Bush. Donald Trump, he said, had “betrayed the people, exaggerated and amplified the truth to foment hatred” and that “social media … is crippling our belief system, turning us against one another.” Last year, he sold half of the rights to his song catalogue to Hipgnosis for an undisclosed amount, but believed to be nine figures. A clue to his views on viruses and vaccines may be found in his autobiography, Waging Heavy Peace, published in 2012. He recalls contracting polio as a five-year-old before a vaccine was widely available, quoting his brother, Bob: “It was obvious that his life was on the line.” Young wrote: “We had a quarantine sign on our house that said Poliomyelitis on it, and warned people about not entering or something to that effect. No one wanted to be near me for a while.” He has had other serious health issues during his life, including epilepsy and a brain aneurysm. A spokesperson for Young said it was not known whether the star would make any further comment on the issues concerning Spotify and Joe Rogan. “He’s very much his own person on things like this,” the spokesperson said. Spotify has been contacted for comment.",News/Technology,WHO chief backs Neil Young over Covid misinformation row with Spotify,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/27/who-chief-backs-neil-young-over-covid-misinformation-row-with-spotify-joe-rogan
