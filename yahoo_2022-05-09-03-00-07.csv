5/9/2022,"Mary Trump said Susan Sarandon is a ""complete idiot"" who ""thinks that she's some wise shaman."" Trump was criticizing recent comments by the actress suggesting its pointless to vote for the Democratic party. ""A vote for Republicans is a vote for fascism,"" Trump said. Former President Donald Trump's niece Mary Trump said that actress Susan Sarandon is a ""complete idiot"" for suggesting it's pointless to vote for the Democratic party. ""She's a complete idiot. She doesn't know what she's talking about, and if anybody can say with a straight face that the Democrats are the problem, I don't know what to tell them,"" Trump said while appearing on MeidasTouch Podcast on Thursday. ""She was pretty decent in a couple of movies a couple of decades ago, but politically she's a moron,"" said Trump. Sarandon, who has a long track record of left-wing activism, has become increasingly critical of the Democratic Party. In a recent tweet, the actress accused them of ""sitting on their hands for the last two years"" and ""scaring you into voting blue."" ""I cannot even tell you how much it enrages me,"" Trump said on the MeidasTouch Podcast. ""She's an idiot, but she thinks she's some wise shaman or something."" Trump said that the actress is a victim of the ""Dunning-Kruger effect"" – a cognitive bias in which people with low ability overestimate their capabilities. ""If we can just make it as simple as possible – a vote for Republicans is a vote for fascism,"" Trump said. Trump appeared on the podcast to discuss the US Supreme Court's leaked draft vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling protecting abortion rights. Sen. Mitch McConnell said on Saturday that a national abortion ban would be ""possible"" if Roe v. Wade is overturned. Trump said the only way to stop the anti-abortion momentum was to stop them from winning Congress in the mid-term elections in November. Mary Trump criticized the draft abortion opinion and noted that the Supreme Court has a majority of GOP-appointed justices. She also criticized the wave of restrictive abortion legislation proposed in several Republican-led states, some of which allow rapists' families and friends to sue a rape victim for having an abortion– such as in Tennessee and Idaho, ""These laws that are being passed, and now that the Supreme Court is federalizing, are not just pro-incest, they're pro-rapist… When your rapist has more rights than you do, that seems problematic to me,"" she said. Several Republican senators would not confirm if they support rape and incest exceptions to abortion bans, Insider previously reported.

5/9/2022,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — The Mexican government said Friday it has closed a limestone gravel quarry owned by a U.S. company, a move likely to add fuel to an ongoing trade dispute with the firm. The Environment Department said Friday it closed the quarry owned by Vulcan Materials near Playa del Carmen, on the Caribbean coast. Parts of the quarry have been excavated below the water table, and the department said the mining threatened water quality and subsoil conditions. But the timing of the move raised questions: Vulcan has been operating the quarry for around three decades, and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador had recently threatened the company. López Obrador wants the water-filled quarry to be used as a theme park to rival the nearby XCaret park. He also wants Vulcan to build a cruise ship dock at a freight terminal it operates on the coast. He has pressured the Alabama-based aggregates company to sell the property to the government, or open a water park itself. Vulcan issued a statement Thursday saying it “strongly believes that this action by the Mexican government is illegal."" “The Company has the necessary permits to operate and intends to vigorously pursue all lawful avenues available to it in order to protect its rights and resume normal operations,” it said. The company's property includes several adjoining sites; some have have already been quarried, and others haven't. In late 2018 the company filed for an arbitration panel under the old North American Free Trade Agreement, after Mexico refused to allow quarrying at some of the sites. The company said a decision is expected in the second half of 2022. The Environment Department said the company is seeking about $1.5 billion in damages. The Mexican government originally said a tentative agreement had been reached with Vulcan Materials, and the company said it was willing to open a water park and cruise ship facility. But it has no experience at doing either, and would really just like to continue mining gravel. López Obrador wants the gravel to use as ballast for another of his signature projects, the Maya Train, a 950-mile (1,500- kilometer) rail line that will run in a rough loop around the Yucatan Peninsula, connecting Caribbean coast resorts with archaeological sites inland. Controversially, and with no environmental studies, the president decided to cut down a swath of low jungle between Cancun and Tulum, near the quarries, to build the train line. He has raised the possibility that the future water park could be a stop on the train line. The project needs huge amounts of gravel ballast to spread between rail ties to stabilize them, and it also needs a seaport like the one Vulcan has to get rails, cars and other train-building materials into the jungle. López Obrador has often used pressure and threats in a bid to get private and foreign companies to shore up his infrastructure plans and projects — state-run ports, terminals and rail lines that could become white elephants unless the private sector boosts them with real traffic. Earlier this week, his administration announced it would force about 20% of the flights using Mexico City's International Airport to move to the Felipe Angeles terminal north of the city, — a project pushed by López Obrador that has struggled to attract flights and passengers because of its distance from the city. Moreover, it was inaugurated before rail and road links were completed, making it hard to get to. Passengers and airlines have avoided switching to the new airport, which currently handles only about six flights per day.",U.S./Associated Press,Mexico closes US gravel quarry that had been pressured,https://news.yahoo.com/mexico-closes-us-gravel-quarry-181843134.html
5/9/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Weapons maker Lockheed Martin Corp plans to nearly double production of Javelin missiles, the antitank weapon that has helped Ukraine fight Russia's invasion, Chief Executive Officer James Taiclet said in an interview on Sunday. The aim is to boost output to 4,000 per year from 2,100 per year currently, Taiclet said in an interview with CBS News. The increase will take as long as a couple of years, he said. U.S. President Joe Biden last week visited a Lockheed facility in Alabama that manufactures the weapons, which are made jointly by Lockheed and Raytheon Technologies, in an effort to press Congress to approve his proposed $33 billion assistance package for Ukraine. The United States has rushed $3.4 billion worth of weapons to Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, including Javelins as well as howitzers, anti-aircraft Stinger systems, ammunition and body armor. ""We can start turning up the heat now and ramping up production immediately,"" Taiclet said, noting the firm is anticipating increased demand for ""superior systems in large enough numbers"". ""We're planning for the long run and not just in the Javelin,"" he said, noting he expects to see increased demand beyond the Ukraine war due to threats from Russia and China.

5/9/2022,"Amazon fired a number of senior managers from its JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island on Thursday, only a month after workers voted to unionize. The New York Times reported that the company axed more than half a dozen senior-level workers on Thursday, many of who were involved in union organizing. A number of anonymous employees told the NYT that they believed the firings were retaliatory. JFK8 is the first and currently the only unionized Amazon warehouse in the US. In a statement to Engadget, Amazon said the workers were fired as a result of “management changes.” “Part of our culture at Amazon is to continually improve, and we believe it’s important to take time to review whether or not we’re doing the best we could be for our team. Over the last several weeks, we’ve spent time evaluating aspects of the operations and leadership at JFK8 and, as a result, have made some management changes.” Other Amazon workers have recently gotten the pink slip, allegedly due to their union involvement. Just a couple of weeks ago, four recently terminated Amazon employees filed charges with the NLRB, alleging that they were being punished for supporting a union. Last month the NLRB ordered Amazon to reinstate Gerald Bryson, a worker at the JFK8 facility who was fired due to what Amazon alleged was his violation of a company language policy. But the NLRB’s judge was not convinced by this argument, and accused Amazon of performing a “skewed investigation” of Bryson and retaliating against him for his union work. Just yesterday, Amazon Labor Union president Chris Smalls testified before the Senate Budget Committee and met with President Joe Biden. The Biden administration has expressed reserved support for unionization efforts by Amazon, Starbucks and other workers. In his testimony before the Senate, Smalls argued that the federal government should avoid awarding Amazon contracts due to its labor practices. “We cannot allow Amazon or any other employer to receive taxpayer money if they engage in illegal union-busting behavior and deny workers’ rights,” said Smalls.",Business/Engadget,Amazon fires senior managers from unionized Staten Island warehouse,https://news.yahoo.com/amazon-fires-senior-managers-from-unionized-staten-island-warehouse-193119240.html
5/9/2022,"CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) — A retired sheriff’s deputy posed as a guest at two Phoenix-area weddings to steal boxes of cards containing thousands of dollars, and is under investigation in a series of similar crimes, authorities said Friday. Landon Earl Rankin, 54, was arrested Wednesday in the thefts at private venues in April and was being held without bond, according to Chandler police and court and jail records. According to police, the two stolen boxes of wedding cards each contained between $3,000 and $6,000. Rankin was a deputy with the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office, joining the agency in 1994. He retired in 2015 but remained a reserve officer until 2017, office spokesperson Lauren Reimer said. Rankin was jailed on suspicion of two counts of burglary. He also was booked on several drug possession and drug paraphernalia offenses because he had amphetamine and fentanyl on him when he was arrested, police said. Court records didn’t list an attorney who could speak on his behalf. Surveillance video from one of the Chandler wedding venues showed Rankin grabbing the gift box, placing it in a bag, walking out the venue's rear door, running to his vehicle and driving away, police said in a probable-cause statement. When interviewed by police, Rankin said he attended the weddings to hear the wedding vows “because he was going through a divorce,"" the statement said. During their investigation of the two Chandler thefts, police learned of at least seven similar crimes in other Phoenix-area jurisdictions, said Sgt. Jason McClimans, a Chandler police spokesman. Rankin is now under investigation in those cases, and Chandler police have heard from “four or five"" additional newlywed couples regarding possible additional thefts, McClimans said.

5/9/2022,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — National park rangers in Alaska on Friday located the body of the year’s first registered climber on North America’s tallest peak. Because it’s so early in the climbing season, Matthias Rimml, a 35-year-old professional mountain guide from Tirol, Austria, was alone on the upper part of Denali, a 20,310-foot (6,190-meter) mountain about 240 miles (386 kilometers) north of Anchorage. The climbing season usually runs from May through mid-July. Other climbers and rangers are camped below the 14,000-foot (4,267-meter) level. Rimml hadn't been considered overdue compared to his planned return date and food and fuel supply, according to Denali National Park and Preserve officials. However, a friend who had been receiving periodic check-ins from Rimml contacted mountaineering rangers Tuesday after not receiving a call for days, officials said in a statement. Park officials said Rimml was already acclimated to the altitude because of recent climbs. He had planned to climb Denali “alpine style,” or traveling fast with light gear. His goal was to make the summit in five days even though he carried enough fuel and food to last 10 days. The average Denali expedition is 17 to 21 days for a round trip, with climbers making the summit on day 12 or 13, according to the National Park Service. Rimml began his climb April 27 from the Kahiltna Glacier base camp at 7,200 feet (2,194 meters), officials said. His last known call to his friend was on April 30, when he reported he was tired but not in distress. Rimml reported his location as just below Denali Pass, at 18,200 feet (5,547 meters) elevation on the West Buttress, the most popular route for Denali climbers. On Wednesday, a pilot and mountaineering ranger in a National Park Service helicopter looked for Rimml. Intermittent clouds didn’t allow a thorough search, but they did not see any signs of him. They saw his tent at 14,000 feet (4,267 meters) but didn’t observe any recent activity, the statement said. High winds and poor weather prevented the helicopter from landing at the campsite, but the helicopter returned Thursday when weather was better. Rangers confirmed Rimml hadn't returned to the tent. Clouds prevented the helicopter from flying above 17,200 feet (5,243 meters) on Thursday, but park spokesperson Maureen Gualtieri told The Associated Press a helicopter with two rangers aboard took off Friday morning from Talkeetna, the nearest community, to resume the search. Rimml’s body was spotted in the fall zone below Denali Pass during the aerial search, park officials said Friday evening in a statement. Rimml likely fell on the steep traverse between Denali Pass at 18,200 feet (5,547 meters) and the 17,200-foot (5,243-meter) plateau, a notoriously treacherous stretch of the West Buttress route, officials said. Thirteen climbers, including Rimml, have died in falls along that traverse, the majority occurring on the descent, the statement said. Recovery efforts will not be attempted until an national park ranger patrol is acclimated to the high altitude. Weather conditions on the mountain have been cold, which park officials say is normal this time of the year. Daytime highs have been around minus 25 degrees Fahrenheit (-3.89 degrees celsius) with winds at the two base camps registering up to 30 mph (48 kph). Five inches (13 centimeters) of new snow have fallen in the past week on the upper mountain. On the website for his guide business, Rimml said he always has been close to mountains and nature. He trained as a carpenter after receiving his high school diploma. In 2015, after he completed military service, Rimml switched to being a freelance ski instructor in Austria and outside Europe. He became a professional mountain guide in 2015, the fourth generation of his family to do so, his biography states. His specialty was long, technically difficult combined tours.",U.S./Associated Press,Rangers locate climber's body on Alaska's Denali,https://news.yahoo.com/rangers-conduct-aerial-search-climber-185446199.html
