2/7/2022,"The Cosby Show was more than just a hit sitcom. It was a sitcom for the whole family, achingly so. Cliff Huxtable wasn’t just a put-upon father of five or a deadpan granddad or an exasperated guardian. He was a sought-after obstetrician who brought even more kids into the show’s fictional world. The scenes of him in his office, consulting with expectant families, allaying the anxieties of pregnant moms, make an important point: for all of Dr Huxtable’s hopelessness at home, he was actually really good at his job, grounding his character while making the adults in the audience feel seen, too.  We Need to Talk About Cosby, the buzzy Showtime documentary series that debuted at the end of January, ahead of Black History Month, views these scenes more skeptically, through the eyes of actor and artist Lili Bernard. In one Cosby Show episode she plays an expectant mother in an office consultation with the good doctor. On its face her scene seems sweet, perfectly innocent. But Bernard describes her on-set experience as emotionally distressful, painting Cosby as a tyrant who bullied her into delivering her lines just so. Her story speaks to a familiar on-set imbalance, the big shot who clashes with the small fry. But the more chilling reveal is that America’s Dad also allegedly drugged and raped her at the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, in 1990, according to her 2021 lawsuit. Herein lies the difficulty of cancelling Cosby for those of us who still consider his work to be worthwhile. It’s one thing to cancel his live performances and pending TV projects; those directly enrich him. It’s another to stop listening to his albums –especially the early stuff, where Cosby shows an R Kelly-like tendency to tell on himself in his Spanish Fly material. But before more than 60 women accused Cosby of sexual assault, The Cosby Show was a television institution in the prime of its I Love Lucy syndication phase. Which is to say you couldn’t channel surf without landing on the episode where Theo pierces his ear or Rudy gets sick or Cliff gives birth to a hero sandwich. Netflix’s acquisition of the series in the late-aughts was not only the start of a strategy of gaining subscribers by gobbling up classic TV, but also echoed the show’s transformational impact in the 80s. In my interview with We Need to Talk About Cosby’s director, W Kamau Bell, he concedes that part of the show’s genius was offering up five different Huxtable children for the kids at home to connect with. Rudy, the baby daughter in the Huxtable brood, was the character who hooked me, who had me setting alarms for 7pm on Thursday nights. And for as inspirational as the show’s seamless fusion of jazz and Black art and Black love and Black prosperity were, my main takeaway was Dr. Huxtable got to work from home. That was #goals. Later years brought an appreciation for The Cosby Show as team effort, the product of years of collaboration between actors and writers and costumers and the like. Those syndication deals were great for Cosby, sure. But they also sustained workers who might’ve had difficulty moving on after the show, especially the Black collaborators. But as the allegations against Cosby snowballed, it was only a matter of time before the show was ripped from the air and from streaming, never to be easily conjured again and affecting more than just the guy whose name was in the title. When Geoffrey Owens, the actor who played Huxtable son-in-law Elvin, was outed as a Trader Joe’s employee in 2018, it spoke to the profundity of a Cosby problem that appears to have no bottom. We Need to Talk About Cosby visits with Cosby Show contributors across the call sheet, from the overworked writers who were too removed to notice anything fishy to the stage manager who negotiated the line of models outside Cosby’s dressing room. While the docuseries steers clear of rendering judgment on folks who were just trying to keep their jobs, it does look harshly on Cliff Huxtable’s character wrinkles that once seemed innocuous – his aphrodisiac barbecue sauce, his job as a doctor who saw women in his basement office. It assumes a room full of writers didn’t have a hand in developing those ideas, or that New York isn’t littered with brownstone doctors offices. Besides, all TV shows turn cringey as our sensibilities evolve. A faithful reboot of the Honeymooners, with Ralph Kramden constantly threatening his wife with physical abuse, would never fly today. The Cosby Show is so much more complicated. In the same way you can draw a line from Will and Grace to the legalization of gay marriage, you can trace a path from the Huxtable brownstone to the Obama White House; you’d be well challenged to tell the history of Black progress in America and on television without a glancing mention of the Huxtables. You could say The Cosby Show is the product of the man’s better angels. But it also ruined the careers and lives of some of the women who did and didn’t appear on the show. It’s a sad story, no doubt, but not unique to Hollywood productions. The key difference here is we know the score. And now that The Cosby Show is dead and buried along with America’s Dad, the kid in me can’t help but wonder if we will ever truly reckon with all that was lost.

2/7/2022,"England led Scotland 17-10 with less than 20 minutes to go on Saturday but Eddie Jones’s side proceeded to unravel and succumbed to an opening defeat on the first Six Nations weekend for the third year in a row. Here are five key incidents from the dramatic finale at Murrayfield.  Try as he might, Marcus Smith found prising open Scotland’s defence a difficult proposition in the first half. All that possession, all that territory but Steve Tandy has built a robust defensive unit at Scotland and England, perhaps lacking a bit in cohesion – not to mention a heavyweight ball‑carrier of Manu Tuilagi’s ilk – were clunky in attack. Smith then took matters into his own hands, pinned back his ears and scored a fine try to seize the lead for England on 52 minutes. He added another penalty 10 minutes later – taking his points tally to 17 – but was then replaced with Eddie Jones turning to the experience of George Ford to see the game out. The head coach bristled at questions over the decision afterwards – “it’s a 23-man squad” – but it is hard not to perceive it as a mistake given how England unravelled thereafter. “I think when he went off it must have been premeditated because he was going really well,” his Harlequins coach, Tabai Matson, said on Sunday. “His opportunity to close out the game would have been great for him but it must have been premeditated.” As much as the question is what was Luke Cowan-Dickie thinking, perhaps it is more relevant to ask what was England’s hooker doing wide on the left and trying to compete for Finn Russell’s crossfield kick? That it was he challenging Darcy Graham for the ball shows how ragged England were after a break from the excellent Duhan van der Merwe and two pinpoint kicks from Russell, who had his dander up by that stage. Ben O’Keeffe, the referee, made the right call in that there is little doubt that Cowan-Dickie, having appeared to jump too early, slapped the ball out of play. England were seven points up at that stage, which calls into question their game management in allowing Cowan-Dickie to be so exposed. Jones said: “I think we put ourselves in a difficult position because we had a 17-10 lead, we had the run of the game and we let them get into our half and gave them easy possession … we ended up having a hooker on the winger on their kick, which resulted in the try and 17-all.” At 17-17 and into the final 10 minutes it was always likely to be a mistake rather than a moment of magic that proved decisive. It is unclear whether Russell was mindful of the fact that England did not have a hooker on the pitch but his kick to give England a lineout deep in their own 22 was just what Scotland needed. Jones did not want to bring Jamie George on until there was a scrum because he preferred to keep three back‑rows on the field but that meant Joe Marler was required to take the lineout, which did not go five metres, handing Scotland a scrum from which they won the decisive penalty. “We do practise for those kind of situations,” said George, who was finally introduced for the scrum that followed Marler’s fluffed lineout. “Obviously the execution wasn’t quite right this time. It is very difficult for Joe coming into that situation, five metres from his own line. I don’t think he would have ever done that in an international game before.” England have pointed to how they created opportunities to win the match after going behind as a reason to be positive and on one hand it rings true. With three minutes to go Will Stuart won a penalty at the breakdown inside the Scotland half and towards the right touchline, with England trailing by three points. It was probably not in Ford’s range but it was for Elliot Daly, who began making his way over from the left when the penalty was awarded. It was a bold decision by Tom Curry, in his first match as captain, to go for the corner instead – had Daly landed the kick England would have pulled level and received the ball from the kick-off – and it did not look too clever when Ford found a pretty rank touch. Surely the left-footed Henry Slade, or Daly, would have been a better option. The error was compounded when Sam Skinner stole the ball at the lineout. George said: “I had nothing to do with it. We felt like we had the upper hand up front. Tom wanted us to go to the corner and at that point I’m all for it. But we couldn’t execute the lineout. We have got a great leadership group and great communicators. They have got full faith in the rest of the group and there’s a lot of experience in the rest of the group to help them. At the same time we are led by them and the direction they want to go.” Ever the diplomats, England refused to point the finger at O’Keeffe for not awarding a scrum penalty at the last. “Dominance” was the word used – multiple times – however. The scrum was reset four times but George revealed he was unable to get his message across properly to O’Keeffe and Ben Youngs was ultimately told to “use it”. What happened thereafter will be just as frustrating for England because yet again there did not exactly appear to be ice running through their veins as they sought the decisive blow. Youngs carried the ball down the left side of the scrum before passing to Daly, who was isolated, and Scotland made the turnover. “I felt like we had dominance,” said George. “I felt like the Scotland scrum were probably just trying to contain rather than to make it an even contest, but they got away with it. I was trying to have a conversation with [O’Keeffe]. There’s a lot of pressure on him in that situation but I would have loved the opportunity to be able to speak to him.”",Sport/Sport,From promise to despair: how England collapsed at Murrayfield | Gerard Meagher,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/07/from-promise-to-despair-how-england-collapsed-at-murrayfield
2/7/2022,"Ihave recently upgraded my living arrangements from a flat with an attic but no garden to a house with a garden but no attic. Unfortunately, in London my ideal set-up of a house with an attic and a garden costs around £28m, but moving to a place with no storage in the loft means I’m forced to confront a problem that has been nagging away at me for years – what to do with my old football programmes. Clearing the attic before the big move should be relatively easy. I have no sentimental attachment to the Nutribullet my brother-in-law bought me three years ago, I am quite content to throw the gigantic, mosaic-tiled mirror my partner was given by her best friend as a 30th birthday present into a disused canal and I can live without Christmas decorations. But throwing out hundreds of largely worthless football programmes from the matches I’ve attended since I was a child will prove more challenging. If I hadn’t got round to buying a programme for the Wales v Jamaica friendly Wales played against Jamaica at Ninian Park in March 1998 would I regret it? No, of course not.  Would I be angry at my younger self if I’d bought the programme on the night, checked that Merthyr-born defender Steve Jenkins did in fact weigh 78kg and then binned it as I left the ground, after the game had played out to an entertaining but goalless draw? No, and that is surely what normal people do with these things. But in 2022, with space in the new house limited and difficult decisions having to be made, can I throw it out? No, that’s out of the question, because holding on to that particular programme for this long makes it 24 years old, which means I am a de facto custodian of football history. It is a static problem, as at the beginning of this season my club Swansea City announced that matchday programmes would be digital only, conveniently accessible on your phone, free of charge. But that doesn’t solve the problem of what to do with the ones already in my possession. The ones from 2002-03, surely I’d want them, we were almost relegated from the Football League, what a memento of survival they provide! What about the ones from our Premier League years, which I initially only started collecting as I assumed our stay in England’s top flight would be fleeting? Well, once you start thinking like that you end up with 40 page keepsakes from games against Southampton you don’t even remember attending, unable to chuck them out in case Swansea never taste life in the top division again. And then of course there’s the programmes from games that happened before I was born – well the FA Cup semi-final against Preston at Villa Park in March 1964, that obviously goes in a frame, but the complete set of 1977-78 programmes that were bought for me at a car boot sale by a well-meaning friend’s mother? Well, they should be binned… but I’ve just noticed that each one has the advert: “Coal: A Big Industry With A Big Future” on the back page which makes them documents of social as well as football history, so yes – they’ll be going to the new house. Maybe my son can get rid of some of his Duplo or my daughter could reconsider her bike. When I first started going to football matches it was a treat, an enormous event, and buying a souvenir programme was a big part of the day. In the pre‑internet era they also served as reference guides, providing the final word in any argument: “You SEE? I TOLD YOU Mark Pembridge is the latest in a long line of South Walian footballers to be discovered by Luton scout Cyril Beech and that Dean Saunders is 5ft 8!” Programmes were mementoes from my first experiences of attending live sport, matches that would have been memorable no matter what happened on the pitch. But once you have attended hundreds of games and you are an adult with a car, a cork noticeboard in the kitchen and a mouthful of aggressive plaque, do the more recent ones pass the Marie Kondo test? Does looking at my programme for West Bromwich Albion v Swansea City from 2 February 2016 “spark joy?” Not really, although on opening a page at random, seeing the phrase “precious Premier League points are up for grabs in this battle between 14th and 15th” did cause my heart to race a little. What I’m actually doing by keeping them, is saving up joy for the future. 2016 still seems so recent, but as long as I hold onto it for long enough, Tony Pulis urging Baggies fans to “get behind the lads” will appear as quaint to me as the summary of referee Bo Karlsson, described in the programme for Wales v Germany in June 1991 as being “a bank clerk in real life”. I was performing at the Salford Lowry before Christmas, and a kind audience member added to my collection by leaving some 1960s Llanelli RFC programmes at the stage door. Unlike my father I’m not really a rugby man, and in recent years his memory has been blunted by Parkinson’s disease. As we looked through this treasure trove of lineups from Llanelli’s golden age, as well as some remarkably unimaginative adverts (“Do You Need Tyres? Visit Llanelli Tyres”), my father displayed an effortless, if unexpected capacity to recall every player who had turned out for his hometown club during his teenage years. The straightforward language of the “Llanelli Players On The Injury List” section sparked joy in us both (sample entry: “John Lugg: HAND STILL IN PLASTER”), but the sheer passage of time turned these initially unremarkable documents into something spellbinding. I can see why some clubs have moved this stuff online. Printed programmes already appear as antiquated as the typewriters they were once written on. But there are certain things you can’t do with an app.",Sport/Football,The end of an era: Football programmes – outdated or great pieces of history? | Elis James,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/07/the-end-of-an-era-football-programmes-outdated-or-great-pieces-of-history
2/7/2022,"Asingle streetlight glowed brightly in the darkening evening as I approached a small wooden door. As it grew closer, the silhouette of a familiar figure emerged. It wasn’t a man, but rather a faun, bowing down to shake my hand – and all at once I’d stepped into the pages of my favourite childhood books containing the fantastical world of Narnia. Yet this was no imagined place. It was, instead, a fittingly magical introduction to the lakeside (or, rather, loughside) village of Rostrevor, situated on the coast of Carlingford Lough in County Down.  I was standing outside the Rostrevor Inn (pre-beer, I should add), at dusk, where a wall mural of the aforementioned Mr Tumnus – created by author CS Lewis, who based his fictional world in the wardrobe on this village and surrounding area – greets visitors. It took me a little by surprise, as until that point I’d been following in the footsteps of another equally thrilling character – though one that most scholars agree actually did exist – that of Ireland’s charismatic patron saint. The St Patrick’s Way is a 132km (82 mile) walking route, first planned 10 years ago, then officially opened in 2015 by the late artist Alan Graham who was inspired by his experience walking the Camino de Santiago in Spain. The idea, wrote Graham, was to link key sites relating to Patrick bringing Christianity to Ireland and, by doing so, create a pilgrimage “of many colours, feelings and memories to cherish”. It runs between the city of Armagh (64km southwest of Belfast), AKA the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland (more on that later) and ends at Downpatrick, the place where the saint is purportedly buried. I arrived at Rostrevor at dusk at the end of day three of this six-day trail. Along for the ride was my 11-month-old son, who, I figured, would never be too young to learn about the joys of a long-distance walk. So far I’d discovered that Patrick had banished snakes from the country, raised 33 people from the dead and – perhaps the most plausibly – taught the concept of the Holy Trinity to the Pagans using the shamrock. All these events felt as if they could easily have been lifted from the oft-theorised Christian allegorical tale of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, so it seemed fitting that part of this walk now also ran in tandem with the story of Narnia itself. Up until this point the trail had largely followed an existing cycle route on quiet country roads. Highlights had included Navan Fort – the site of a Celtic temple from the year 95BC, which is now a grassy mound said to be the birthplace of kings and queens (which, it must be noted, felt very Cair Paravel to a Narnia aficionado), and the twin hilltop cathedrals of St Patrick in Armagh – the simple stone Anglican one said to be the site where he built his first stone church in 445 and the imposing double-spired, grey Catholic number, built 1,400 years later. Then there was the towpath along the Newry Canal from Scarva to Newry – AKA the oldest summit level canal in Great Britain and Ireland, which, since its retirement as a trade route, has become something of a wildlife corridor featuring otters, mink, an abundance of birds, 19 species of butterflies, damselflies and dragonflies; and the views from Carlingford Lough of the nearby Cooley Mountains. Despite enjoying walking through the landscapes and pre- and post-Christian sites, as we began day four, our pilgrim passports filling up nicely with stamps – from 10 different outdoor locations along the route – I was hungry to feel terrain beneath my feet that wasn’t tarmac. This day’s section would see me head up into Kilbroney Park – known fondly in mountain bike circles for its many trails. We entered the woodland. Almost immediately the distinct scent of damp pine trees filled my nose, and the soft squelch of a muddy footpath sucked at my boots. As we climbed higher on the path I stopped to admire oak, cedar, beech and sycamore specimens. Eventually the trees thinned and we emerged on to a faint, boot-beaten trail on the flanks of the lower Mourne Mountains. “I have seen landscapes, notably in the Mourne Mountains and southwards which under a particular light made me feel that at any moment a giant might raise his head over the next ridge,” wrote CS Lewis of these peaks. As we broached the saddle between Rocky Mountain and Tornamrock I was inclined to agree. Though I’d been to the top of the Mournes before, I’d never seen them from this angle. There wasn’t another soul around, the cloud shrouded the higher tops like a pilgrim’s cowl, but as we descended my son shrieked in delight as it began to evaporate to reveal the pronged summit of Hen Mountain ahead. I stopped to feed him, and, looking at his cosy waterproof all-in-one, marvelled at how difficult this passage would have been for St Patrick back in the days before Gore-Tex and pre-bookable accommodation. Speaking of which, as the St Patrick’s Way didn’t spawn naturally as a pilgrim route like its Spanish equivalent, which meanders through handily placed towns and villages, but rather as a desire to link sites using existing footpaths, logistics can be an issue. As such I’d pre-booked a taxi to pick us up at Spelga Pass, splitting up this fairly remote 38km section, so that we could overnight in nearby Newcastle, before returning to the trail the next morning to pick up where we left off. Fish and chips were the easiest pilgrim feast to grab on arrival at the seaside town and, followed by an early night, I awoke to the view of Northern Ireland’s highest point, Slieve Donard, just peeking out from the mist. I took it as a good sign as it’s said a hermit’s cell lingers in the cairn of this mountain as well as the remains of a small chapel that was frequented by Donart, one of Patrick’s disciple-cum-Pagan converts. That day was one of the best: we summited the deliciously named Butter Mountain, where we caught a glimpse of the taller peaks, before descending into Tollymore Forest Park, where the proliferation of giant redwoods, old stone bridges, rocky outcrops, grottos, caves and stepping stones made me feel as if I had, once more, returned to Narnia. We only met one other pilgrim on the entire walk – a local woman called Donna, from Armagh who, with her friend, had begun completing short sections of it during lockdown. “Of course I was raised a Catholic,” she explained as she leafed through her well-used pilgrim passport, “but that’s not why I’m doing it. For me it’s about discovering my own country. But the walk itself is very calming and somehow spiritual.” The final stretch on my last day was calming, as Donna had described: a walk along the beach, passing through Murlough Nature Reserve, on what’s also known as the Lecale Way (which colloquially was once called the St Patrick’s Way as it was believed he travelled along the coast). With sore legs from hours treading on sand, and the last leg on tarmac through quiet farm roads, I ended my exploration in the saint’s footsteps, fittingly, at the place where he ended his life’s journey. Here a stone is simply marked “Patrick”. When we approached the adjacent St Patrick Centre, which marks the official end of the pilgrimage, we were greeted by a familiar figure once more – but this time it was the larger-than-life image of the man I had been following. Inside, I proudly swapped our fully stamped passports for “Compostelas” (pilgrim’s certificates) and mused how this pilgrimage as mum and son had been something of a baptism of fire. Exhausted (me) but elated (definitely him), we sat down to watch a short film on the history of St Patrick’s arrival to Ireland, first as a slave and then as a missionary, and his work including the many miracles and the banishment of all snakes. As a non-Catholic, the legends sounded like a tumultuous romp that even Hollywood might back away from for being too far-fetched. Much like friends stared in disbelief when I said I’d completed a long-distance walk with a baby on my back. Yet, now that I’ve done it, a part of me believes that in the land that spawned fauns, a talking lion and a white witch, all inside a wardrobe, anything is possible.

2/7/2022,"Q In May 2018, I bought a property with a friend. His deposit was larger than mine although we split the mortgage equally. In the deed of trust that we signed we agreed a breakdown of ownership between us of 56% (him) and 44% (me) to reflect the uneven deposits.A year ago we had a bathroom renovation which I paid for with the agreement that we would change the percentage of ownership. Now that it’s complete we can’t work out a fair way to calculate what the new breakdown should be. Can you help?AB A I don’t think I can because I don’t think that paying for a bathroom renovation changes the ownership breakdown. If you had paid for an extension to be built or had a loft conversion done, it would make a difference. According to Andrew Boast, the co-founder of the house-moving experts SAM Conveyancing, “more living space, more value”. “Replacing a kitchen or bathroom,” says Boast, “doesn’t increase current market value” but it does improve saleability of a property and increases the chances that “full asking price is achieved”.  That is not to say that your contribution to the property should not be taken account of. However, in order to do that it may involve revoking (to use a technical term) your current fixed deed of trust and replacing it with a floating deed of trust, also known as a commensurate share deed. A floating deed, says Boast, “provides joint owners of property a more accurate way to assess the beneficial interest in a property – the money you individually own – at a specific point in time based on your contributions towards the property”.",Lifestyle/Money,I bought a property with a friend – how should we split ownership?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/07/i-bought-a-property-with-a-friend-how-should-we-split-ownership
2/7/2022,"When I was a student, there was a craze among a small group of my friends for a bestselling self-help book called Women Who Love Too Much by an American therapist whose name was Robin Norwood. We were all feminists, though at this point (it was the late 80s) the f-word was painfully unfashionable, and on our shelves was lots of seriously good – if then already slightly retro – theoretical stuff: Kate Millett, Janet Radcliffe Richards, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar. Also, of course, Our Bodies, Ourselves by the Boston Women’s Health Book Collective, in its millionth (or so) edition. But somewhat to our embarrassment, it was Norwood’s book whose spine was the most cracked. What can I say? At 19, and away from home for the first time, all we really wanted to know was how to stop wasting so much of our time and energy on horrible men.  The grandiloquently titled Sexual Revolution: Modern Fascism and the Feminist Fightback sounds more Kate Millett than Robin Norwood; it promises something serious-minded and galvanising, even if the word fascism does, in context, whiff just a little of Rick in The Young Ones. But as I read Laurie Penny’s “searing critique of male dominance”, it was Norwood of whom I thought. If the tone of this book is almost comically relentless – if Penny, whose pronouns are they/them, says something once, they say it 54 times – it’s also oddly reminiscent of a superannuated self-help manual, its assumptions seemingly based mostly on the experiences of its author and their friends, a focus group to whom every possible Bad Thing has happened at least once (so handy). Men? Oh, they’re in terrible distress; they’re forever emailing Penny to tell them just how toxic masculinity is. Women? Well, they’re in terrible distress too, only they’re fighting back. To sum up: “More women are asking if they might do something bigger with their lives than wear themselves out saving the world one man at a time.” For the reader, especially the reader who has never read a book or a newspaper, never watched any television or seen a film, Penny has all sorts of revelations. For instance: there are now more women in the “male workplace” than for centuries. Patriarchy, in case you don’t know, is a “power system based on male dominance” and consent “is not an object you can hold in your hand” (unlike some things Penny could – and does – mention). It should also be noted that there are currently a lot of authoritarians around: Bolsonaro, Johnson, Putin, Trump, Jacinda Ardern … No, not Ardern. Ha, I almost got you there, didn’t I? Actually, Penny doesn’t mention Ardern at all, nor even Angela Merkel. Anyway, moving on: things are grim because women are still judged far too much on their looks, ageism is very cruel, and male violence is just, like, everywhere. But don’t be disheartened. Penny has good news, too. Like them, we may eventually be able to overcome our addiction to “predators with pretty eyes and a vacancy for a secret side-piece”. We may even wind up loving ourselves instead of just waiting around “for a man” to find us lovable (for someone who identifies as gender-queer, and who therefore has some trouble with the word woman, which does not reflect her “lived experience”, Penny uses “man” with an abandon that is quite dizzying). Heterosexuality is – newsflash! – “in trouble”, but good sex is still possible, once you “stop looking to White supremacy and patriarchy to define its terms”. Penny herself enjoyed a fantastically sexy weekend in Berlin in 2018 – good clean (or not) fun of a kind no “pearl-clutching Promise Keeper or chatroom-addled crypto-fascist” is ever likely to experience. Most crucially of all, something is now – out in the world, I mean – fighting to break out, as if from a shell: something “wet and angry”, with “claws”. By this, I think Penny is referring to the ongoing activism that was stirred by #MeToo, but I suppose it is possible – I’m troubled by the word “wet” – that I’ve got this entirely wrong. Personally, my feminism is fiercer than it has been for decades. I don’t disagree that things are still appalling for women, and in some senses I believe they’re getting worse. But the reader waits in vain for Penny to offer solutions to the injustice she describes, for serious analysis of any kind. The best they can do is to suggest that affordable childcare might be of help. No shit, Sherlock. The chapter devoted to sex work is utterly enraging, and not only because Penny clearly knows so little about it (where are the interviews, the statistics, the thoughts of experts in this field?). Having painstakingly explained that many women enjoy sex – that they do not, contrary to the old myths, only endure it, the better to keep their men happy – Penny then accuses those women, feminists and others, who are critical of the sex industry of, yes, a sort of twisted envy, because why should some women get paid for what others have to do for free? I’m afraid I clutched my own pearls (inherited, I should say, from a grandmother who left school at 13) at this point. Having spent half of my life hoping for feminism’s revival – for it to be, if not fashionable, then proudly worn and meaningfully directed – it is lowering beyond words to see a serious publisher describe this ill-edited, ill-considered drivel as a manifesto for the cause. This isn’t feminism. This is a swizz.  Sexual Revolution: Modern Fascism and the Feminist Fightback by Laurie Penny is published by Bloomsbury (£20).

2/7/2022,"Moving the account you use for everyday spending is one of the easiest ways to make sure your money is being used in an environmentally friendly way.  It’s often hard, or impossible, to find out exactly what the big banks are investing people’s money in, or supporting in other ways. So if you want to be sure your cash isn’t going towards financing industries or projects harming our world, seek providers who are explicitly backing green projects. Arguably, the UK’s most ethical current account provider is Triodos Bank, based in Bristol and part of a group founded in the Netherlands. It says it only finances organisations making a positive impact for people and the planet. Its current account, operated online and via an app, comes with a contactless debit Mastercard and offers an overdraft of up to £2,000. But there’s a £3 monthly fee, and no high street branches, so it won’t suit everyone. Of the high street banks, the Co-operative is the only one that has expressly prohibited support for fossil fuels, says Ethical Consumer, an independent, not-for-profit organisation that reviews companies and products. The Co-operative Bank calls itself “the original ethical bank,” but is now majority-owned by a group of hedge funds and fund managers, which may trouble some. Then there are app-based banks such as Monzo and Starling, which may well be “cleaner” when it comes to what they invest in and lend to because they are newer, smaller, and don’t necessarily have financial interests around the globe, but aren’t as transparent as a bank such as Triodos. “If you particularly want to switch to an app-only bank, Starling appears marginally more engaged than the others on ethical issues,” says Ethical Consumer’s website. Another option is a building society because they are owned by members, not shareholders. The biggest, Nationwide runs a number of current accounts. Meanwhile, some credit unions offer current accounts. To find one near you, go to findyourcreditunion.co.uk Moving your bank account is now quick and easy – the industry’s current account switch service has taken away a lot of the hassle. A lot of the above also applies to savings accounts. The good news is, there’s much more choice. There are lots of building societies, including Ecology, which uses savings cash to fund environmentally friendly mortgages. It offers several accounts, including easy-access and regular-savings paying 0.1% and 0.8% respectively. Triodos Bank has a range of accounts including a junior cash Isa (for those saving for a child) currently paying 1.5%. Charity Bank lends to charities and social enterprises and has notice accounts paying up to 0.35%, and fixed-rate bonds paying up to 0.75%. Credit unions are another option. Don’t forget about National Savings and Investments (NS&I) – its mission includes “providing cost-effective financing for government and the public good”. As well premium bonds it has a choice of savings accounts. There are a huge number of green/ethical/sustainable funds. Which you decide to put your money into will, to a large extent, come down to personal taste and how much risk you’re willing to accept. “With more choice than ever, and performance stacking up well against traditional funds, there’s little reason not to choose a sustainable fund for your Isa or other investments,” says Lisa Stanley, the co-founder of ethical money website Good With Money. Her site’ “good investment review” lets you see which funds get the highest green rating. For financial advisers, check out The Path Financial, BlueSphere and Castlefield, among others. David Macdonald at The Path Financial says: “It’s important to get under the bonnet and really ask some of the hard questions to make sure a provider is as green as they appear to be.” If you are investing without an adviser, there are a growing number of apps, investment platforms and the like that offer ready-made green portfolios. Those that Stanley likes include Clim8 Invest, Circa5000 (formerly known as tickr), The Big Exchange (co-founded by The Big Issue), Wealthify’s ethical plans, and Moneybox’s socially responsible options. Meanwhile, Sugi helps you analyse the carbon impact of your current investments and offset your portfolio. There are also ethical investment platforms that allow people to invest directly in bonds or shares issued by charities and businesses. They include Ethex and Abundance. There’s an estimated £2.6tn invested in UK pensions, and a chunk of it funds industries such as fossil fuels and weapons. But there are things you can do to make your retirement fund more eco-friendly. Most workplace pension schemes automatically put members into a “default fund,” which may, or may not be, very (or at all) green. But many offer an ethical or sustainable fund option, and staff can opt to pay some, or all, contributions into that. If it’s not clear what the deal is, talk to the trustees of the scheme. The good news is that during the last couple of years, a number of big UK workplace pension schemes have taken action – for example, by setting net zero carbon emissions targets for their holdings. This will see them moving away from investments in polluting companies. Insurance can be tricky in environmental terms because there might be several companies involved in a policy. A comparison website can find youa provider, but the policy may be underwritten by a different company. Ethical Consumer says insurers with “better” climate change policies include Zurich, Axa and Aviva. The latter plans to be net zero by 2040. Stanley says: “On the smaller side, Naturesave offers home, travel and business insurance, donates 10% of its annual home and travel insurance income to charity, and plants a tree for each new policy issued.” Be aware that the Co-op sold its insurance underwriting business at the end of 2020. A growing number of financial firms are launching mortgages that incentivise buying or owning an energy-efficient home by offering borrowers more favourable terms than come as standard. That usually means either a slightly lower interest rate, or a cashback payment when the deal is taken out, or both. Some of these loans are restricted to people buying a new-build property. Lenders offering such deals include NatWest, Barclays, Nationwide and Leeds building society, with more coming on board all the time. Aside from the above deals, building societies are a better bet generally when it comes to mortgages due to the fact they lend mainly in the housing market rather than other more unethical sectors, says Ethical Consumer. Ecology building society specialises in home loans for properties and projects that have a positive environmental or social impact, such as certain self-build and renovation projects.",Lifestyle/Money,Green money: how your finances can help the planet,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/07/green-money-how-your-finances-can-help-the-planet
2/7/2022,"Donald Trump’s incendiary call at a Texas rally for his backers to ready massive protests against “radical, vicious, racist prosecutors” could constitute obstruction of justice or other crimes and backfire legally on Trump, say former federal prosecutors. Trump’s barbed attack was seen as carping against separate federal and state investigations into his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his real estate empire.  Trump’s rant that his followers should launch the “biggest protests” ever in three cities should prosecutors “do anything wrong or illegal” by criminally charging him for his efforts to overturn Joe Biden’s 2020 victory, or for business tax fraud, came at a 30 January rally in Texas where he repeated falsehoods that the election was rigged. Legal experts were astonished at Trump’s strong hints that if he runs and wins a second term in 2024, he would pardon many of those charged for attacking the Capitol on 6 January last year in hopes of thwarting Biden’s certification by Congress. Former Richard Nixon White House counsel John Dean attacked Trump’s talk of pardons for the rioters as the “stuff of dictators” and stressed that “failure to confront a tyrant only encourages bad behavior”. Taken together, veteran prosecutors say Trump’s comments seemed to reveal that the former president now feels more legal jeopardy from the three inquiries in Atlanta, Washington and New York, all of which have accelerated since the start of 2022. Trump’s anxiety was especially palpable when he urged supporters at the Texas rally to stage “the biggest protests we have ever had in Washington DC, in New York, in Atlanta and elsewhere,” should any charges be brought, a plea for help that could boomerang and create more legal problems for the former president. Dennis Aftergut, a former federal prosecutor who is of counsel to Lawyers Defending American Democracy, told the Guardian Trump “may have shot himself in the foot” with the comments. “Criminal intent can be hard to prove, but when a potential defendant says something easily seen as intimidating or threatening to those investigating the case it becomes easier,” Aftergut said. Aftergut added that having proclaimed “his support for the insurrectionists, Trump added evidence of his corrupt intent on January 6 should the DOJ prosecute him for aiding the seditious conspiracy, or for impeding an official proceeding of Congress”. Likewise, a former US attorney in Georgia, Michael Moore, said Trump’s comments could “potentially intimidate witnesses and members of a grand jury”, noting that it is a felony in Georgia to deter a witness from testifying before a grand jury. Trump “is essentially calling for vigilante justice against the justice system. He’s not interested in the pursuit of justice but blocking any investigations”, Moore added. Trump’s angry outburst came as three investigations by prosecutors that could lead to charges against Trump or top associates all seemed to gain steam last month. A special grand jury, for example, was approved in Atlanta focused on Trump’s call to Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger on 2 January last year, asking him to just “find” enough votes to block Joe Biden’s Georgia victory, a state Trump lost by more than 11,700 votes. Trump’s call for huge protests prompted the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, who is leading the criminal inquiry, to ask the FBI to do a threat assessment to protect her office and the grand jury that is slated to meet in May. Last month too a top justice official revealed that DOJ is investigating fake elector certifications declaring Trump the winner in several states he lost, a scheme reportedly pushed by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani by which vice-president Mike Pence could block Congress from certifying Biden’s win. To Trump’s chagrin, Pence rejected the plan. Further, the New York state attorney general last month stated in a court document that investigators had found evidence that Trump’s real estate business used “fraudulent or misleading” asset valuations to obtain loans and tax benefits, allegations Trump and his lawyers called politically motivated. Ex-prosecutors say that Trump’s Texas comments are dangerous and could legally boomerang as the prosecutors appear to have new momentum. “Our criminal laws seek to hold people accountable for their purposeful actions,” Paul Pelletier, a former acting chief of the fraud section at DOJ, said. “Trump’s history of inciting people to violence demonstrates that his recent remarks are likely to cause a disruption of the pending investigations against him and family members.” Pelletier added: “Should his conduct actually impede any of these investigations, federal and state obstruction statutes could easily compound Mr Trump’s criminal exposure.” Trump’s remarks resonated especially in Georgia, where former prosecutors say he may now face new legal problems. Former prosecutor Aftergut noted that Willis understood the threat when she quickly asked the FBI to provide protection at the courthouse, and he predicted that the immediate effect on the deputy DAs working on the case would be “to energize them in pursuing the case”. In a similar vein, ex-ambassador Norm Eisen and States United Democracy Center co-chair said Trump’s call for protests in Atlanta, New York and Washington if prosecutors there charge him “certainly sounds like a barely veiled call for violence. That’s particularly true when you combine it with his other statements at the Texas rally about how the last crowd of insurrectionists are being mistreated and did no wrong”. In addition, congresswoman Liz Cheney, the co-chair of the House panel investigating the 6 January Capitol assault by Trump followers, has stated that Trump’s talk of pardons and encouraging new protests suggests he would “do it all again if given the chance”. On another legal front, Aftergut pointed out that some Trump comments at the rally might help prosecutors at DOJ expand their inquiry. “Trump handed federal prosecutors another gift when he said that Mike Pence should have ‘overturned the election’.” Some veteran consultants say Trump’s latest attacks on prosecutors shows he is growing more nervous as investigations appear to be getting hotter. “Trump’s prosecutor attacks are wearing thin with the broad Republican electorate,” said Arizona Republican consultant Chuck Coughlin “He’s trying to whip up the base for his personal gain. This is another iteration of Trump’s attacks on the government.” From a broader perspective, Moore stressed that Trump’s multiple attacks on the legal system at the Texas rally represent “just another erosion of the norms of a civilized society by Trump. The truth has taken a backseat to Trumpism”.",News/US news,"Trump’s incendiary Texas speech may have deepened his legal troubles, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/07/donald-trump-incendiary-speech-texas-legal-troubles-experts
2/7/2022,"The first time Richard Epstein went to his local ice-skating rink in Santa Fe, New Mexico, he was handed a free pair of skates. They had been left behind by a discontented customer. “I do things out of my comfort zone, and good things happen,” he observes. This wisdom was borne out last December, when Epstein, now 78, skated in his first exhibition. His wife filmed his routine, which he performed with his coach, Teri Moellenberg, then his eldest daughter posted it on Twitter, along with a note that Epstein has stage four prostate cancer. Nearly 3 million people viewed it. Epstein is somewhat baffled by the response, describing himself as “just an old guy going around in circles”.  My father is 77 years old and has stage 4 prostate cancer. He decided to learn how to ice skate a few years ago, and just did this performance with his teacher.For anyone that thinks it’s too late to try something new… ❤️ pic.twitter.com/0SZ3FmbNGE Often, when he drives to the rink, as he does three times a week, he reminds himself that good things follow discomfort. He always feels “a little anxious … Am I going to stumble? There is a risk of failure that I have to get over and work through – a barrier,” he says, beyond which lies “the feeling of being well, having accomplished something, feeling a little proud of myself”. As a child, Epstein was “really terrible” at sports. He still feels embarrassed that he couldn’t throw a ball straight. “I’m an active person but one of the world’s worst athletes. I don’t have this ‘used to be good’ mentality,” he says. What he does have is a long personal and professional history of embracing mistakes, and uncertainty. At high school, Epstein was streamed in “the medium track”. (“Don’t expect too much from these kids!” he giggles.) However, when he studied physics in college, the world and his own place in it began to make sense. “It gelled – it’s who I was.” A research physicist with stints at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics, Epstein is now an unpaid research professor at the University of New Mexico. He has published 200 technical papers and worked for the past two decades on a refrigerator that can reach very low temperatures with no vibration. He hopes to reach “a major milestone” in this project in the next year. Somehow, he retains a “fading” sense of not fitting in. “I guess – to put things into some context professionally – I’m dyslexic. Totally poor memory,” he says. He has “mental scaffolding to compensate … It’s fun to find our individual approaches to make sense of the world.” He used to look back at his childhood self, and think that one day he would feel “relaxed and cool and comfortable in my own skin … I’m still waiting,” he says with a chuckle. Maybe ice-skating compensates for clumsiness in childhood? Epstein has also tried snowboarding, rock climbing and inline skating, all of which challenge balance. He insists he doesn’t mind falling, though these days he wears pads at the rink. Did the response to his exhibition video make him feel more connected? “It didn’t really make me feel: ‘Oh, I’m accepted now,’” he says. “I wasn’t really trying to relate to people – I was trying to relate to my daughters.” As a scientist, he has always committed to projects with uncertain futures, and worked fruitfully in that unmapped space. The word he comes up with to describe his scientific style (and perhaps he would say it applies to the rink too) is “bumbling”. “That’s my biggest skill,” he says, and, although this sounds modest, it does not speak of ineffectualness so much as a deep love of exploration uninhibited by fear of failure. Epstein enjoys how the ice “takes me out of my ordinary ways”. There’s “the wind blowing through my hair. It is a joy to glide and turn, to get on the inside edge of the skate – that feeling of a centrifugal force.” He is receiving treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia as well as prostate cancer, and, while he experiences no “unpleasant symptoms or side-effects”, the illnesses are “a strong reminder of mortality”. For now, he hopes the refrigerator “could be a big deal”, and that he manages to perfect his “three turn”, so called because the blade carves a 3 into the ice. “That would be, to me, a very significant step forward.” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",Lifestyle/Life and style,A new start after 60: ‘I’m one of the world’s worst athletes – but I learned to skate in my 70s’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/07/ice-skating-a-new-start-after-60
2/7/2022,"When Robson Scott, a live music fan from Newcastle, went to his first gig in 2011, he remembers paying around £30 for a standing ticket to see Katy Perry at Utilita arena. Ten years later, he says, “for arena gigs of that calibre you’d usually be paying over £65.” That’s a rise that far exceeds the UK’s rate of inflation during that time, which was 2.6% per year, on average, or the equivalent of £8.90. A scan of current ticket prices for artists who are at the superstar level that Perry was in 2011, when she’d had a string of No 1 hits and had released her most successful album Teenage Dream a year earlier, confirms Scott’s experience. Standing tickets for Billie Eilish’s 2022 tour are around £75 for UK arena dates, for example, while Robson recently paid £89 for a standing ticket to see Harry Styles at Emirates Old Trafford.  On top of the decade-long incremental rise, there is evidence of further price increases since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Weekend adult tickets for Green Man festival are up to £210 this year from £189 in 2019, while Latitude festival is charging £227, up from £202 in 2019. The world’s largest live music promoter, Live Nation, said in its latest quarterly financial results that strong demand enabled “improved pricing”, and that the average amphitheatre or major festival ticket price had seen double-digit growth from the last pre-pandemic year. What’s driving the increase? Greg Parmley, CEO of industry trade body LIVE, points to rising costs and shortages throughout the supply chain, which make putting on gigs and festivals more expensive than before. “From skilled crew right the way through to Portakabins and toilets, there are shortages across the UK that are driving up costs significantly. This is on top of the well-publicised wider inflationary pressures that are flowing through the economy,” he says. Music agent Natasha Gregory, who is working on the current Idles tour (tickets for which are priced between £30-40, depending on the venue), confirms what Parmley says: “Tour-related costs are through the roof at the moment.” According to Gregory, part of that is due to requiring extra staff for Covid-related checks and cleaning; tests and visas when travelling between markets (the latter due to Brexit); an increase in venue hire fees, and having to change plans or refund tickets as a result of the evolving Covid-19 situation. “Finally, no one has insurance for these shows, which is impossible to get against Covid,” she says. “If a tour has to be cancelled last minute, no one gets their money back. It’s a big risk for many bands, so you have to add more contingency costs.” Green Man festival owner Fiona Stewart says her costs have risen 34.5% since 2016 against a 20% rise in ticket prices. This year, “we’ve started to see real problems with sourcing goods and services,” she says, adding that Brexit has also exacerbated issues for festivals. “A lot of the big touring infrastructure, which Britain was a world leader in, has been completely decimated. Now, because you can only make two stops if you’re a British vehicle in any European country, all those companies are moving to Europe so everything we utilise to do with infrastructure has increased in price.” Stuart Galbraith, CEO of promoter Kilimanjaro Live, says that gig ticket prices are typically set by an artist, their agent and manager in collaboration with the promoter. Prices will take into account costs as well as supply and demand, so “if an artist chooses to go with a very high ticket price, that’s with their full knowledge,” he says. However, Adam Webb, campaign manager at FanFair Alliance, which was set up to challenge industrial-scale online ticket touting, says that demand can be distorted by the secondary ticketing market. In the US, so-called dynamic pricing is frequently used, which is where gig ticket prices change according to demand (much like flight and hotel prices). The problem with this, says Webb, is that prices are set according to what’s in the secondary ticketing market, too, which can include non-existent and speculative tickets being sold by touts for huge markups. This practice isn’t as rampant in the UK although Webb is starting to see it creep in – an example of which can be seen in the standing ticket prices for Coldplay’s forthcoming stadium shows, which have inflated from £85 face value to over £300 (and that’s for official tickets, not ones from secondary sites). Webb says: “As we’ve seen with numerous media reports [about] Viagogo in the UK, the big secondary websites appear to be rife with speculative listings. Consequently, using them as a benchmark for your pricing is problematic. Taking what might be a speculative listing and claiming it’s reflective of ‘demand’ or ‘market price’ is a distortion.” Aside from the effects of dynamic pricing, Kilimanjaro promoter Galbraith does expect to see a continued hike in average ticket prices over the coming years due to increasing costs. “They will increase by necessity,” he says. “We’ve just endured two years of begging the government for subsidy and we’ve done everything we can to keep everybody’s jobs and the industry going.” Suppliers offering equipment and services for live shows, including trucking, stages, security and toilets for outdoor events, he says, “are in a seller’s market and have to maximise their income for survival.” With the cost of living reaching its highest level in almost 30 years in December, when inflation jumped to 5.4%, while average wages have dropped, is there a risk of live music becoming elitist? “No, I don’t think there is,” says Galbraith. “There will always be hundreds of thousands of artists who want to maximise the number of people coming to see them for as little as possible. “You could accuse superstars of driving up their ticket prices, but that’s their choice, and I do think that, at a grassroots level, for many names who progress all the way up through theatres, arenas and stadiums, we will continue to see sensibly priced tickets.” Robson isn’t so sure: “Even with the inflated prices, I’m still going to go to gigs because music is what I live for. But working-class people are getting priced out of seeing the musicians they love.”",Arts/Music,‘Working class people are getting priced out’: cost-of-living crisis spreads to live music,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/07/how-live-music-joined-cost-of-living-crisis
2/7/2022,"Grief, says playwright Morgan Lloyd Malcolm, is an endurance test. “It feels impossible sometimes, but when you come through certain chunks of it, you feel really proud that you’re still standing.” Her new play, When the Long Trick’s Over, investigates various forms of endurance, and follows a swimmer from one side of the Channel to the other. Using the dual lens of grief and sport, she wanted to write her way towards understanding “what a human body is capable of”.  By setting the show almost entirely in water – occasional flashbacks take place on land – Lloyd Malcolm handed her team an impossible task. “You could get a massive water tank and try to tour that round the UK,” she says doubtfully, “but that’s not going to work. So how do you create the sense that you’re swimming?” The HighTide production, directed by Chinonyerem Odimba and starring Stacey Ghent and Shenagh Govan, is currently in rehearsal. They are experimenting with aerial work and digital projection to create an illusion of the depth and breadth of the water between Dover and Calais. Lloyd Malcolm has long been fascinated by Channel swimming. Several times, she has been tempted to try it herself. When she wrote the play, named after a line from John Masefield’s poem Sea Fever, she was in the midst of loss. “My dad had died the year before,” she explains over Zoom. “I was doing a lot of open-water swimming, and it was really helping.” Both she and her dad loved outdoor swimming, and at the time she was writing the play, she was considering doing a Channel swim in his memory. “There’s something about returning to water,” Lloyd Malcolm says slowly, trying to pin down why it’s such a comfort. “It’s womb-like, the sounds of it, the feeling of being held.” But cold-water swimming has something particular to it, something sharp. “You get in and it feels” she sucks in her breath, “really intense and hard. Then it feels really good, and it gives you a rush. Being outside and being under the sky.” She shakes her head: “It just really helps.” Lloyd Malcolm is best known for her speculative history play Emilia, which reimagines the life of 17th-century poet Emilia Bassano. Starting out at Shakespeare’s Globe, the Olivier award-winning show rocketed to the West End of London, winning rave reviews and avid fans. “There’s a pre-Emilia and a post-Emilia in the way my career has gone,” she says, clearly still a little bowled over by the response to the show. “I wasn’t struggling before, but things weren’t really getting anywhere.” When the Long Trick’s Over was one of those plays long stuck in development. “I was pregnant with my youngest,” she says, figuring out how long ago she wrote it. “She’s about to turn seven.” She has made tweaks to the text, but its core is still embedded in that immediate grief she felt eight years ago. While her proximity to the pain has shifted, it is still there. “I don’t think you ever really let go of grief,” she says. “It hits you again and again.” Another form of long-term pain is brought into the story with the swimmer’s sister, who suffers from periods that hurt to the point of being unbearable. It’s something Lloyd Malcolm’s own sister deals with. “We’ve not been able to work out what it is,” she says, “and it’s devastating. We’re still so behind on how women’s health is treated. There’s this idea that periods are just something we should suffer through, when it can be hugely debilitating.” And so the show became a story of two sisters, one of them struggling to hold on through the pain, one of them struggling to hold on to the other. Lloyd Malcolm is quick to stress that the show is fun, too. For research, she talked to many Channel swimmers, and learned that they often make obscure lists in their heads as they swim; since the 21-mile feat can take between 12 and 24 hours, they need mind games to break up the monotony. In the show, her swimmer starts by listing her favourite 90s songs, which subsequently make up the show’s playlist. It might be eight years late, but Lloyd Malcolm believes that this is the right time for the play to be staged. “It’s dealing with all the stuff we’ve been dealing with in the last couple of years,” she says. “We’ve been enduring something for so long, we’re all exhausted. Hopefully it’s a bit of a hug of a play.” Perhaps it’s time to finally take on the Channel, too. “Every so often I think I’ll do it one day.” Later this week, she’s talking to a group at Brockwell Lido in south London who are planning on swimming from Jersey to France. “I’m going to try to do that this summer. So, she says, slightly nervously. “I’m edging my way towards it.”  When the Long Trick’s Over is at the New Wolsey theatre, Ipswich, 11-15 February and livestreamed on 14-15 February.

2/7/2022,"The supply chain crisis over the last year has caused quite a splash for the book publishing industry – literally. In early January, a large shipping vessel coming from Taiwan was stalled in the mid-Atlantic, its arrival into the port of New York delayed by port congestion. Intemperate weather – huge waves and powerful ocean winds – knocked 60 containers overboard. Another 89 containers were damaged as the ship rolled in the waves.  Inside the containers were two highly anticipated cookbooks scheduled for release this spring: Turkey and the Wolf by the New Orleans chef Mason Hereford and Dinner in One by the New York Times columnist Melissa Clark. “The good news is that there were no critical injuries, as can happen in these situations. But the bad news is the books might be in a cargo container at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean,” Hereford wrote on Instagram, saying it was the “most hilariously 2022 thing to happen yet this year”. Both authors pushed back their books’ release dates to later in the year. The loss of the books to the stormy seas almost seems like too apt a metaphor for the strain and chaos the coronavirus pandemic has inflicted on the publishing industry as it struggles to cope with supply issues, paper shortages and a surge in demand. The effects of the crisis have been far-reaching: even Donald Trump has weighed in, lamenting to Fox News about delays in printing more copies of a photo book of his presidency, titled Our Journey Together, that is being printed by Donald Trump Jr’s publishing company. According to Trump, the book’s printer told him, “Well, we have one problem: We can’t get paper. We can’t get ink. We can’t get glue. We can’t get leather for the covers.” While these issues are new to Trump, the publishing industry has been experiencing difficulties in its supply chain for months, affecting the release dates and availability of new titles. Hachette UK’s chief executive, David Shelley, warned in December that supply chain problems were causing the “most extreme” challenges he had seen in his career. The strain on the book industry’s supply chain coincides with soaring demand for print books during the pandemic. Print book sales in the US were up 8.9% in 2021 compared with 2020, which was already up 8.2% compared with 2019. While increased sales is generally good for the industry, book printing capacity has diminished over the last decade. One large US printer closed in 2018, while two others have significantly downsized their book printing operations in recent years. “It’s been a long-term trend to see diminished capacity in printing,” said Brian O’Leary, executive director of the Book Industry Study Group, which has been analyzing the industry’s supply chain problems. “That loss of capacity has been an issue since 2018, well before the pandemic … but there has been continued consolidation and declining capacity.” Printers have not been able to keep up with the increased demand from publishers as investment in new printing machines is costly, and it is unclear whether demand for print books will continue to rise. Paper has also been harder to find, O’Leary said. Mills have cut back on producing paper for books and magazines, instead using pulp to make more cardboard, packing and other types of papers that are more lucrative. While buyers once had the upper hand in the paper market and could order as much paper as needed, paper mills now tell printers how much paper they can give them. The shortage of paper has, in some cases, visibly changed the size of books. Different grades of paper will determine the thickness of a book. One Twitter user in September posted a picture of two copies of Donna Tartt’s The Secret History, one significantly thinner than the second though both are the same price. TODAY on the frontlines of publishing's whacked out supply chain pic.twitter.com/me2jtAzsyd Some books, especially those that require a lot of color like cookbooks and art books, are typically printed in Asia, where the cost of printing is cheaper. But like many industries trying to ship goods across oceans, delays abound. Large ports on both coasts have been clogged for months, with dozens of ships floating offshore waiting to dock and unload their containers. Containers have piled up on docks, leaving a lack of space and a shortage of containers, as there has been a shortage of truck drivers. Warehouse storage has also been scarce because of labor shortages in warehouses and companies stockpiling products to meet demand. Book publishers expect that this slate of supply chain problems will continue this year. “We have to anticipate some continuing disruptions in 2022. We’re working hard to improve our ability to receive and ship our books faster and [keep] more reliable schedules,” Hachette Book Group’s CEO, Michael Pietsch, said in a company-wide email last year. The clogs in the supply chain have been especially tough for independent booksellers across the country, who have had to encourage customers to be patient with titles that are out of stock or have delayed releases because of the supply chain. “It’s made things a little bit more stressful just because things are always changing last-minute now. A lot of books have very long publishing timelines, and we’re just seeing a lot of books getting their publication dates pushed back,” said Colleen Callery, marketing and communications manager at Books Are Magic, an independent bookstore in Brooklyn. Some books have had their release dates pushed back several times, which leads to “domino effects”, affecting pre-order campaigns and events. Callery said that customers have been patient, and the bookstore’s sales have not been affected, in some part because of campaigns encouraging readers to shop at independent bookstores. In a statement to the Guardian, Allison Hill, CEO of the American Booksellers Association, said that many independent bookstores saw an increase in demand over the last few years. “2020 and 2021 were challenging years for so many businesses, and independent bookstores were no exception, struggling with significant increases in costs and uncertainty, but their recent sales have been encouraging,” Hill said. Independent booksellers have started to change the way they order books, Hill said, predicting what new titles will be popular, investing in titles they want to promote and reserving copies in case stock runs low. Booksellers have also been recommending more backlist titles – books that are not considered new releases – to customers, encouraging them to buy books they already have in stock.

2/7/2022,"New greenfield housing developments are locking residents into car dependency, making everyday journeys impossible without a vehicle, a new report has found. Meanwhile, pledges for walking, cycling and public transport are often left unfulfilled. The group Transport for New Homes (TfNH) visited 20 new housing developments in England, finding that while those on urban brownfield sites generally lived up to sustainable transport pledges, greenfield sites were often far from shops and amenities, without public transport, cycling links or even pavements, and the homes themselves were seemingly designed around car parking.  Surface transport is responsible for 22% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions, and the Climate Change Committee says reducing demand for car travel is key to meeting emission reduction targets. Campaigners say housing pledges in the “levelling up” white paper, launched last week, will do little to achieve this and that planning reform is urgently needed. The government aims to build 300,000 new homes a year to meet growing demand. The report, Building Car Dependency, which follows research from 2018, says greenfield housing “has become even more car-based” in recent years, adding hundreds of thousands of additional car journeys to our roads. Steve Chambers, a campaigner at TfNH, told the Guardian: “We have found places where you can’t do anything without getting into a car; you literally cannot do anything. There is nothing within walking distance, there’s nothing within safe cycling distance, and for work, for going to the shop; for everything you can imagine, you need to get in the car. “The impact of that is that houses are being designed around two and three parking spaces with tiny back gardens, no front gardens whatsoever, and that poor design obviously crowds out walking, cycling, and basically good homes.” “There isn’t even the most basic public transport in a lot of places. There isn’t even a bus route, which is clearly an issue.” The report did identify a few cases of greenfield developments with sustainable transport links, such as Hampton Park in Peterborough, Poundbury in Dorset and Derwenthorpe in York, but otherwise found “the internal road layout, the car access on to major roads with bigger junctions to take the traffic, the sheer quantity of residential car parking, all told the story”. During the pandemic, residents of such estates reported being unable to walk anywhere because the surrounding roads lacked footpaths. While car access was built first, TfNH say walkable elements such as a high street, a children’s centre or community facilities arrived after driving habits were formed. At Chapelford Urban Village, on a former RAF site north-west of Warrington, a new railway station finally opened in 2019, 15 years after the first homes were sold. “Quick wins” such as footpaths to nearby shops or park-and-rides failed to link up or led nowhere. In one case, shops adjacent to a retirement home were rendered inaccessible to less mobile residents by an ankle-high fence. Some front doors opened directly on to car parking spaces. In Cranbrook New Town, near Exeter, a road was too narrow for buses to reach a new bus stop. Exceptions were at brownfield sites like Bath Riverside and Trumpington Meadows in Cambridge, the former where “the public realm is shaped around walking” with car parking “limited and mostly out of sight”. Steve Gooding, chair of the steering group for Transport for New Homes, told the Guardian: “There’s no evidence coming through in the report that at scale we’re managing to deploy new housing in a way that really promotes the government’s parallel objectives of promoting active travel, public transport and alternatives to the private car. And unless we do that, then it shouldn’t surprise any of us that the car is going to be the default choice for the vast majority of trips that people make.” Among the report’s recommendations are that new housing is “recast around sustainable travel”, with compact, mixed-use developments such as European-style apartments above business premises. In addition, less parking per home would reduce sprawl and make use for pavements, green space and a network of Dutch-style cycle routes. Authors also want devolved powers for things like local rail and bus rapid transit systems, with funding diverted from road-building to provide walking and cycling links. Chambers added: “We’ve found everything from developers planning applications, through to the local plans of local authorities, right up to the National Planning Policy Framework have incredibly warm words about walking, cycling, public transport, and ‘creating vibrant walkable places’, and what we have shown through our visits and our documentary evidence, hundreds of photographs, it simply isn’t being delivered. “There’s no reason to believe that what’s presented in the levelling up white paper – which make no changes to the planning system, and crucially includes no new funding whatsoever – will have different outcomes.” Rosie Pearson, chair of the Community Planning Alliance, said: “Developers are building in the wrong place, with the wrong design and the wrong layout. This locks in car dependency from the outset, leading to persistent traffic jams, dangerous conditions for pedestrians and cyclists, and air pollution. It’s time for change.” A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “We welcome this report and agree that new development should be less dependent on cars. By 2030, we want half of all journeys in towns and cities to be walked or cycled and are investing £3bn into bus services. “National Planning Policy is clear that significant development should give priority to pedestrians, cyclists and public transport, and we will be updating guidance later this year to promote street design that favours walkways and cycle paths over motor traffic.”",News/Society,"New greenfield housing forcing people to use cars, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/07/new-greenfield-housing-forcing-people-to-use-cars-report-finds
2/7/2022,"We need to know if we have a realistic claim against Norwegian Airways, to which we paid £2,676 for flights to America which are no longer possible to take. In August 2019, having saved up for years, we bought flights to Florida for a once-in-a-lifetime family trip to Disneyland. Covid hit and the airline cancelled.  At the time, we were persuaded to take “points” rather than a cash refund, and told these could be used to rebook. In December 2020, we booked new Norwegian flights to Florida, paying a cash top-up. However, a month later Norwegian announced it would no longer be flying to the US, and the flight was cancelled. The points were returned to our rewards account, and the small cash sum refunded. Since then, I have been trying to get the airline to refund the cost of the original flights, but to no avail. When I agreed to take the points, it was on the understanding they would be used to buy new US flights. The points expire on 22 December this year. Can you offer us any hope? KD, by email In March 2020, when the airlines started cancelling flights, Guardian Money was strongly advising readers to hold out for cash refunds, often in the face of refusals by the airlines which were determined to offer vouchers instead. The biggest problem is that Norwegian Air UK – the bit of the company that sold you the original flight – has gone into liquidation, and is no longer flying to the US. Unusually, its parent firm, Norwegian Air Shuttle, is still honouring the rewards programme which, in effect, holds yours – and countless others’ – credit. It’s doing this to retain some goodwill. The company told me that when you agreed to take the points you, in effect, entered a new contract, and it is for this reason that it cannot give you a cash refund. Coby Benson, a flight lawyer at Bott and Co, describes the case as a “sad set of circumstances and a cautionary tale regarding accepting an airline’s vouchers”. As a result of the liquidation, he says, there is little prospect of a refund. He suggests contacting your credit card company, but you paid by debit card. I have come up with one possible solution, though. If you decide the points are worthless to you, there is nothing to stop you using them to book other people on Norwegian flights, and coming to a financial arrangement with them behind the scenes. Norwegian has confirmed the booker doesn’t have to fly. It must be worth a try. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

2/7/2022,"Garmin’s latest top-of-the-line Fenix 7 track-it-all adventure smartwatch introduces a number of new features, better GPS, longer battery life and improved tech – as well as a touchscreen to go with its buttons. Starting at £599 ($699.99/A$1,049), it can hit £1,000 or more if you pick the largest, most fancy version. But the new luxury device does give us a preview on what the firm’s cheaper sports watches may feature later in the year.  The Fenix 7 comes in a range of sizes, weights, materials and with an optional solar-charging system, all of which have full mapping. The new model looks like a refinement rather than a revolution away from previous Fenix designs. The 7S is the smallest, sleekest version with a 42mm case and 1.2in screen, although it is still obviously a sports watch. The standard 7 and supersized 7X are larger, chunkier beasts but are still light and comfortable to wear. The new touchscreen makes the Fenix feel slicker and more modern. You can tap and hold on widgets on the watch face to jump straight to things such as a graph of your heart rate, battery power settings or notifications, or swipe through menus, screens and maps. For daily smartwatch functions it works very well. But touchscreens are unreliable during activities, don’t work well in the wet nor with gloves. Garmin has kept its excellent five-button control system and disables touch when you start most activities, to prevent accidental pauses of runs or similar. Because of the smart way Garmin has integrated the touch system with buttons, everything can be controlled via either method or both at the same time. It is genuinely great The transflective colour LCD screen looks the same as its predecessor – clear and easy to read in direct sunlight, with a backlight for the night. But the power-efficient technology doesn’t look as slick as OLED screens. Screen: 1.2, 1.3 or 1.4in transflective MIP LCD Case size: 42, 47 or 51mm Case thickness: 14.1 to 14.9mm Band size: standard 20, 22 or 26mm quick release Weight: 42 to 68g body only Storage: 16 or 32GB Water resistance: 100 metres (10ATM) Sensors: GNSS (GPS, Glonass, Galileo, BeiDuo, QZSS), compass, thermometer, heart rate, pulse Ox Connectivity: Bluetooth, ANT+, wifi The watch can be used independently of a smartphone, unlike rivals, paired via Bluetooth to an Android or iPhone, or synced with a Mac or Windows PC using the Garmin Express app and included USB cable. But the watch has wifi to sync data straight to your Garmin account, download new apps, system and map updates, too. The Fenix 7 lasts for a very long time between charges. Connected to my phone for smart notifications, with full activity and health-tracking features active, including blood oxygen monitoring during sleep and three hours of running, the watch lasted over 15 days and nights. It should last up to 40 hours of running with GNSS or longer with some power-saving features turned on – long enough for practically any activity. Note the smaller 7S has shorter battery life or the larger 7X lasts longer, while solar models can add up to four days extra smartwatch use or eight hours of running, too, roughly double the Fenix 6 Pro solar. It takes more than 2.5 hours to fully charge the Fenix 7 via USB, hitting 50% in an hour. The Fenix 7 can track practically every activity under the sun, with well over 60 activities preloaded and more available from the Connect IQ store. They cover all the sport and adventure bases, including walking, hiking and running in its various forms, most things concerning a bike, swimming and various water sports, triathlons and other multisport events, skiing, climbing, strength and gym work. And even some ball sports. It has two meaningful improvements to Garmin’s best-in-class running tracking. The improved GNSS consistently gets a satellite lock faster outdoors and indoors, and produces much more accurate live pace estimations compared with its predecessor. The new real-time “stamina” measurement for running and bike-based activities is a live estimate of how much energy your body has left as a percentage, based on your fitness, sleep, activity, recovery and other factors the watch tracks during your day. Your potential energy goes down steadily as you run, while your current stamina shrinks faster when putting in more effort and recovers when taking it easier. If the bar hits zero it doesn’t mean you’re immediately going to shut down but it is likely you won’t have the energy for top performance. Combined, they allow you to better pace yourself, such as if you’ve started off too fast in a race or haven’t pushed it hard enough in training. It gives you instant information of how much you have left after each interval or whether you’ve got the energy for a proper sprint finish. Afterwards, you can see a chart of your stamina against distance, pace or the other metrics the watch records. The Fenix 7X has a light that acts as a torch or as a running light at night, flashing red as your arm swings back and white as it goes forward, making you more visible to cars. The sapphire solar models have an additional “multiband GPS” feature, which increases tracking accuracy around tall buildings or vegetation by locking on to the newer “L5” frequency band of GPS as well as the usual “L1” band. The watch has Garmin Pay for contactless payments but few banks are supported in the UK. The Fenix 7 is generally repairable. The battery is rated to last at least a few years of frequent charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% capacity. In lasting more than 15 days between charges, in theory, the battery would not need to be replaced for as long as 20 years. The watch does not contain any recycled materials. Garmin guarantees at least two years of security updates from release, but typically supports its devices far longer. Garmin offers trade-in schemes for some lines and complies with WEEE and other local electronics recycling laws. The Garmin Fenix 7 comes in a variety of sizes and models, starting at £599.99 ($699.99/A$1,049) for the standard 42 or 47mm models. Solar models cost from £689 ($799.99/A$1,199) and the top sapphire solar models cost from £779.99 ($899.99/A$1,499). The Fenix 7 is a powerhouse of a do-it-all, go-anywhere, track-anything adventure watch, that is very much the best in the market. It is an excellent follow-up to the Fenix 6 line that introduces meaningful upgrades, many of which are expected to flow down into Garmin’s numerous lines of less expensive, more focused products over the next year. The longer 15-day-plus battery life, faster performance, better GPS, a touchscreen and stamina metrics are great additions to the comprehensive tracking Garmin is known for. Most people will only use about 5% of what the watch is capable of but that 5% will be different for each person and each occasion. The Fenix 7 is an expensive, statement purchase. If you just run or cycle it will be overkill but if you have the cash, do lots of activities or just like the idea of being able to parachute into the middle of nowhere and still find your way home, this is the watch for you. Pros: tracks everything under the sun, very long battery life, optional solar charging, cross-platform phone notifications, Garmin Pay, full offline mapping, offline Spotify, Bluetooth, wifi, 100m water resistance, real buttons, accurate GPS/GNSS, choice of materials. Cons: expensive, big, limited Garmin Pay bank support, limited smartwatch features compared with Apple Watch/Galaxy Watch, no voice control, screen basic compared to OLED.
