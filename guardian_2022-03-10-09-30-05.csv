3/10/2022,"A drainage system wrongly built by Carillion and unchecked by Network Rail led to the Stonehaven train crash, investigators have found, when a Scotrail train hit debris washed by rain on to the railway track. Three people died on 12 August 2020 in the worst fatal event on the UK railways in 18 years, when the passenger train from Aberdeen to Glasgow derailed at Carmont, near Stonehaven, after heavy rainfall. Inspectors said the drainage system and earthworks, installed in 2011-12 by the contractor Carillion to stabilise the slope above the track, “had not been constructed in accordance with the original design and so were not able to safely accommodate the water flows” when almost a month’s rainfall, 51.5mm, fell in three hours. The changes made by Carillion, which went bust in 2018, were not noted by Network Rail, which did not inspect the upper parts of the drainage system after a handover in 2013. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch’s final report on the disaster also found that route controllers had “not been given the information, procedures or training needed” to effectively manage the situation, and that Network Rail had not fully implemented risk measures developed after previous events involving extreme weather. Despite a nearby landslip the same morning, and floods from the extreme rainfall, no speed restrictions were imposed and the train was travelling at 73mph when it hit the gravel washed from the drainage trench and came off the tracks, striking a bridge parapet. One of the four carriages overturned and another fell down a steep embankment and caught fire. The RAIB said the outcome would probably have been less severe for a more modern train with better “crashworthiness” than the 1970s-built HST model involved. The train drivers’ union Aslef called for moves to start immediately to take the HST train type out of service. The three people who died included two train staff: the driver, Brett McCullough, and the conductor, Donald Dinnie. One passenger, Christopher Stuchbury, died, and the other six people on the train were injured. The report said many more casualties could have arisen but for the low numbers travelling during the Covid-19 pandemic. The RAIB’s chief inspector, Simon French, said the tragedy highlighted “the risk of uncontrolled changes to railway infrastructure during construction” and was “a reminder how potentially dangerous Britain’s volatile weather can be”. French said the railway should “get even smarter about the way it counters this threat” and “urgent[ly] provide real-time decision-makers with the information, procedures and training they need”. He said shutting down the railway during bad weather would force potential passengers on to roads, which were “undoubtedly much more dangerous”. But the accident should not be dismissed as a one-off event, he added, and the industry “needs to think through the implications of severe weather on its infrastructure”. Andrew Haines, Network Rail’s chief executive, said the report showed there were “fundamental lessons to be learned by Network Rail and the wider industry”. “As well as expressing our deep sorrow and regret … we acknowledge it should not have taken this tragic accident to highlight those lessons,” Haines said. “We must do better.” He said they had invested tens of millions of pounds in improving rail’s resilience to weather, including inspecting similar locations and drainage systems across the country. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers’ union, said: “The failures identified in this report are so bad that we believe this must be a watershed moment in the way we ensure the safety of passengers and staff on our railway network.” ScotRail’s chief operating officer, Ian McConnell, said the report made for “very sober reading”, adding that while most of the RAIB’s recommendations related to other parties, “ScotRail will play its part fully in ensuring that safety lessons are learned … to do everything possible to reduce the risk of something like this ever happening again.” Solicitors acting for relatives of a victim and for injured passengers said the report showed “a catalogue of failures within Network Rail”. Neil Davidson, a partner at law firm Digby Brown, said: “The RAIB investigation clearly shows rail management had prior knowledge of several known risks – they were told to improve, yet still failed to act. This is the very definition of negligence.” The rail regulator, ORR, is conducting a separate investigation into the crash, with Police Scotland and the British Transport Police. It expects to hand over a final report to Scotland’s public prosecutor, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, in the coming months.",News/Business,"Wrongly built drainage system led to Stonehaven train crash, investigators find",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/10/wrongly-built-drainage-system-led-to-stonehaven-train-crash-investigators-find
3/10/2022,"Lenny Henry is to make his debut as a playwright with a drama about the injustice of the Windrush scandal. Henry will also star in the one-man show, August in England, which is to be staged at the Bush in west London in spring 2023 as part of the theatre’s 50th birthday celebrations. The play, he said, “is a story that needs to be told about the scandal, and the massive effect it had and continues to have on our community”. His character, August Henderson, is described as a charmer with the gift of the gab, who is “proud of the life he has built since landing in his beloved West Bromwich”. August’s father arrived in England from Jamaica in 1960, with young August and his mother joining him a couple of years later. Now, August runs a fruit-and-veg shop, has three children and is engaged to be married but he suddenly finds himself faced with deportation to a country of which he has no memory. “I’m excited to be presenting my first ever play at London’s home of new writing during its 50th year,” said Henry, who is of Caribbean origin and was born in Dudley, not far from West Bromwich. “I’ve long been a fan of the Bush and their programme which both reflects our modern world but importantly also discovers and develops new diverse talent for the industry.” August in England will be co-directed by Lynette Linton, the Bush’s artistic director, and Daniel Bailey, who has received acclaim for his current production at the theatre, Red Pitch, about gentrification, youth and sport. In 2017 the Guardian uncovered the Windrush scandal, in which thousands of legal residents in the UK who had arrived from the Caribbean between 1948 and 1971 were misclassified as illegal immigrants. This led to people losing access to benefits, being made homeless and facing detention or deportation. Many of the individuals affected had come to the UK from the Caribbean as children but lacked paperwork. Henry, who said he “felt the sting of this injustice sharply”, previously explored the scandal as executive producer and star of the 2019 TV monologues Soon Gone: A Windrush Chronicle, co-produced by the Young Vic theatre. With those short dramas, he said at the time, “we wanted to honour the pioneering generation, now in their twilight years” and “give voice to a marginalised community, currently being threatened with deportation from a motherland they thought had welcomed them with open arms”. When the Bush presented its first ever production in 1972 it was based above a pub of the same name in west London. It now has a vibrant, recently redeveloped home around the corner in Shepherd’s Bush. The actors and playwrights whose careers were boosted by the Bush include Alan Rickman, Cush Jumbo, Victoria Wood, James Graham and Arinzé Kene. Linton said the Bush would celebrate “half a century of doing what we do best: providing for and reflecting the community around us and commissioning plays which give voice to unheard and marginalised voices, often during difficult times”. The 50th birthday season will also include new plays by Waleed Akhtar, Matilda Feyiṣayọ Ibini, Will Jackson, Anoushka Lucas, Nikhil Parmar, Margaret Perry, Ambreen Razia and Beru Tessema.",Arts/Stage,Lenny Henry to make playwright debut with Windrush drama,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/10/lenny-henry-to-make-playwright-debut-with-windrush-drama
3/10/2022,"Two months after Elizabeth Holmes was found guilty of defrauding Theranos investors, her former business and romantic partner, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, began his own trial on Wednesday. The trial of Balwani, who served as the blood testing startup’s co-president, shares several parallels with Holmes’s. The businessman is accused of similar crimes, including wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud investors, and will appear in the same San Jose, California, courthouse where Holmes spent more than 12 weeks defending herself. Jury selection began on Wednesday, with opening arguments expected to start on Tuesday of next week. Balwani’s case marks the latest chapter in a cautionary tale that has inspired films, podcasts and a television show, and prompted a reckoning with the Silicon Valley hype machine. Both trials centered on the spectacular rise and fall of Theranos, the company Holmes founded after dropping out of Stanford at 19 years old that promised a revolutionary blood testing technology, attracting millions of dollars in investments. But in 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company fell short of this ambitious pledge, revealing that its tests were largely inaccurate and that it was running most labs on third-party machines with traditional blood drawing techniques. A jury convicted Holmes in early January of four counts related to wire fraud against investors, and remains free on bond pending her sentencing hearing on 26 September 2022, after Balwani’s trial concludes. Balwani, 56, is being charged separately for his own role in Theranos, where he served in varying capacities including co-president and a member of the board from 2009 to 2016. He has pleaded not guilty. While guilty verdict in the Holmes trial does not have any direct legal bearing on Balwani’s charges, experts say having a second opportunity to argue a Theranos case could give the prosecution an advantage. “It does permit prosecutors to better understand what worked in that trial and what didn’t,” said Michael Weinstein, a former Department of Justice trial attorney and current white collar defense attorney at law firm Cole Schotz. Balwani rose as a prominent figure during Holmes’s own fraud trial, where the founder testified extensively about their relationship. The pair met when he was 37 and she was an 18-year-old high school student. In her own trial she accused him of controlling behavior, which she argued ultimately led to her business decisions that resulted in the fraud charges. Prosecutors, however, sought to prove Holmes acted alone and had the final say in Theranos’s missteps. “She chose to be dishonest with investors and patients,” prosecutor Jeff Schenk said in his closing arguments. “That choice was not only callous, it was criminal.” The domestic violence defense was ultimately less prominent than initially anticipated, Weinstein said, raising the question of whether Balwani’s legal team will address the abuse allegations in court. He has previously denied the accusations. Balwani’s trial is almost certain to generate less spectacle than Holmes’s, which was marked by fervent media coverage and long lines of observers waiting for a coveted courtroom seat. But his case could still have wide-ranging impacts on Silicon Valley and investing-related regulations, said Weinstein, as federal prosecutors seek to prove the Holmes verdict was not a fluke. “It’s the legal equivalent of the famous Bat signal shining brightly into the sky but here, it’s the prosecution shining a light into Silicon Valley puffery, misleading public facing statements and false investor disclosures,” he said. “When and if those occur, government wants Silicon Valley to know there is a new sheriff in town in determining whether startups actions cross the line between enthusiasm or intentional fraud,” Weinstein added.",News/Technology,Sunny Balwani trial starts two months after Elizabeth Holmes’s guilty verdict,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/09/theranos-sunny-balwani-trial-begins-elizabeth-holmes
3/10/2022,"There was once a dream that was Paris. It lasted for just over an hour. At which point, enter the old world – and enter Karim Benzema, who had the night of his storied footballing life in this Champions League last-16 second leg. Under the lights of the Bernabéu Paris Saint-Germain produced one of the more extraordinary collapses of elite football’s modern history, a collapse made all the more abject by the divine well of talent in this Paris team, the gerrymandering certainties of Messi-dom, of that divine front three, bought to secure the crown of European club football in this, our year of Qatar 2022. And football can be bought. The glorious history of Real Madrid is testament to that. And yet, somehow, also, it can’t. This was, with all due apologies to the supporters of PSG in its own twisted way an oddly life-affirming humiliation. For 61 minutes Madrid had been stretched in every direction, tortured on the left flank by the brilliance of Kylian Mbappé. Madrid looked tired. They looked harried and flat. Those white shirts have a vital sense of self: occasionally beaten, but never out-flashed or out-glitzed, remaining always their own cold clean crisp square of light. But this felt like something else, a shifting of the hound beneath those regal feet. At which point something strange happened, one of those rare moments where time and space seem to stretch in weird directions. What does £350m of attacking talent get you? Not to mention limitless nation-state finances and the greatest club footballer of all time. Brittleness. Operatic collapse. A sense as Madrid pressed hard, of something glossy, callow and frail. Fast forward from 61 to 78 minutes and the birds above the Bernabéu were already flying backwards through the sky, as Benzema completed a 17-minute hat-trick with the most impudent of touches. The goal to make it 3-2 on aggregate came straight from kick-off with the scores only just levelled on the night. A single forward pass caused panic in that hilarious, high-kicking farce of a Parisian defence. Benzema nipped in front of his man to nudge the ball into the net with the kind of touch you might reel off in a game of lunchtime corridor football, turning away and bellowing back at the stands with something that felt as much like rage as joy or disbelief. There was time for PSG to lose their cool, for some hacks and kicks and lunges. But they were done by that stage: finished, toasted, flambéed. And if it was unavoidably comical, there was also something grotesque in the spectacle of collapse. For an hour this supernaturally talented team, gassed and juiced and pumped up beyond the limits of its domestic league, had romped around the Bernabéu like princelings. It was always impossible not to see something of old and new in this match-up, of ambition versus inheritance. And it seemed with 39 minutes gone that this tie was dead, that an unanswerable force was being applied. Some of the Madrid fans had cheered Mbappé when his name was announced. Yes, we recognise you. This is us. And he was a living nightmare for Real’s left side for long periods. This was pain, suffering, fear, a sense of pre-humiliation every time he went veering on to the ball. How do you mark that which cannot be marked? Mbappé was a ghost. And six minutes before half-time he was out there once again in his own huge lime green space, freed by a single pass from Neymar. The finish was beautiful, a feint followed by a ping hard and low into the corner. This is something to be treasured. Mbappé is 23 now, but also six years into his elite career. The natural speed and balance, the hard-honed super-shredded physique are at their peak. Plus every part of the craft is nailed, matured, fine-tuned, to the extent he can improvise and create, blow bubbles, a footballer reaching out into the far comers of his own supreme talent. It seemed for most of this game that would be the story, a thrilling footballer taking another significant step. Except, it wasn’t. Thank you, Paris. Because, frankly, this was a gift. Who saw it coming? Probably only Benzema, who just kept coming, pressing his shoulder to the wheel and producing two neat finishes to turn the game before that final moment of fantasy. Benzema has 30 goals in all now this season. He remains such a complete, brilliantly smart forward. But Madrid will surely sign Mbappé in the summer whatever happens from here. They’re a billion dollars in debt. What’s another 150 million? This is the brand, the future earnings, the strange white soul of this club. It was too much for Paris here, who gave us first brilliance, then finally that sense of something fragile; a brittleness that was both painful, and also oddly bracing by the end.",Sport/Football,"After Mbappé’s illumination, Paris again becomes the city of dying light",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/09/after-mbappes-illumination-paris-again-becomes-the-city-of-dying-light
3/10/2022,"On Tuesday night, a quiet street in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles had a rare celebrity visitor. P22, the city’s most famous mountain lion, was spotted around 7pm on Berkeley Circle, about three and a half miles south of his home in Griffith Park. The National Park Service later confirmed his presence through a radio collar. Residents shared photos from doorbell cameras and grainy pics from inside their homes. “Ultimately, it’s pretty awesome,” one resident told the LA Times. “The whole neighborhood’s excited.” The sighting marked a unique outing for the beloved lion, who is hardly spotted in public despite living in an urban park that’s visited by millions of people, and whose enigmatic and attractive nature have earned him the nickname “the Brad Pitt of mountain lions”. P22’s presence is also a potent reminder that these large cats live cheek-and-jowl with the megacity’s human inhabitants, though they generally keep to the coastal scrub brush chaparral of the mountains and rarely enter human developments. It’s not clear why P22 left his home range of Griffith Park, but it’s also not the first time: in January he appeared on the deck of a house in Beachwood Canyon, caught on video by a camera. He also hid under a house in Los Feliz in 2015 and mauled a sleeping koala at the LA zoo the following year. A study published by the National Park Service in September 2021 analyzed data from 29 GPS-collared adult and subadult mountain lions in the Santa Monica Mountains, Simi Hills, Santa Susana Mountains and nearby areas. They used 128,133 locations to estimate home range size and evaluate how they used the landscape, including investigating which parts of it mountain lions prefer to spend time in. Most of the creatures avoided human areas, or came close only at night. There were two exceptions in the study – P41, a male cat in the Verdugo Mountains area, and P22, who possessed the smallest home range ever recorded for an adult male: just nine square miles surrounded by freeways and residential areas in and around Griffith Park. These two males also ventured into residential areas far more than any other mountain lions, though the park service researchers note that even for them, 90% of their locations were in natural areas. “Interestingly, these two males exhibited strong differences in selection relative to time-of-day that appeared to be responses to human activity,” said John Benson, senior author and an assistant professor of vertebrate ecology at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, in a statement. “When we analyzed selection on an individual basis, we found that these two males altered their behavior towards avoidance of developed and landscaped areas during the day, but towards selection of those areas at night.” This February marks the 10th anniversary of P22 wandering into Griffith Park as a young lion and making it his home. He has plenty of deer to eat, no male competitors in his territory, but also no hope of finding a mate. “A city long bashed for being a concrete jungle full of smog proves the world wrong by making a home for a mountain lion,” Beth Pratt, California director for the National Wildlife Federation, recently told the Guardian, adding that she loved how the city had embraced an apex predator. “The LA area possesses a value of coexisting with wildlife that I celebrate – people share their Ring videos of P22 making an appearance in their back yard with excitement, not fear.”",News/US news,‘Pretty awesome’: celebrity mountain lion’s walkabout excites Los Angeles residents,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/09/mountain-lion-los-angeles-california-p22
