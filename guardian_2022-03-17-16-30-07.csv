3/17/2022,"There’s a civil war on in Sweden, and yet no one seems to know why. It’s gonna be a bad one, as imagined by the sporadically tense and consistently pointless Netflix thriller Black Crab, which sends the country into a state of dystopian devastation only five short years removed from the present. Brother has been pitted against brother, and yet the dividing lines between them remain hazy. At a glance, there’s no evident rift of class, race or ideology defining the sides in this conflict. No one mentions what they have got against those bastards in the opposition, or the way of life they’re willing to die to preserve. That doesn’t have to be a problem; many soldiers marching off to fight cannot articulate the big-picture geopolitical impetuses for doing so, and that’s just how the powers that be like it. But seeing as we are here to question the morality of military action, it would certainly help to understand what everyone is arguing about. In narrowing focus to the plight of speed skater Caroline Edh (Noomi Rapace), director Adam Berg and his co-writers (Jerker Virdborg, author of the source novel, and Pelle Rådström) give themselves enough room to wriggle out of the most difficult questions their premise poses. The mission she accepts, and her subsequent disillusionment with the cause upon completing it, illustrate the broad principle that war is no good while exempting the film from assuming a meaningful stance on the one at hand. That would require the creative team to commit to a partisanship outside of its vague, agreeable conclusion that peace is the only way, and they are more interested in the path there. Perilous and icy, it’s where all the most diverting moments take place in this against-the-elements tale of survival that goes off course in straining to be something more profound. A prologue joins Caroline and her young daughter as a traffic standstill stops their car in a tunnel, fellow motorists soon running past her from gunmen in balaclavas. They nab the kid and set the plot in motion, though it’s hard not to fixate on the distinctly uprising-ish flavor to the guerrilla warfare and concealed identities, both of which go unexpanded upon and unaddressed. Instead, we jump ahead to the thick of societal breakdown, as army functionaries pluck Caroline from a squalid train-car and drive a hard bargain: if she’ll transport a tactically vital mystery canister across a frozen archipelago, she’ll be reunited with her family. One in a unit of six reluctant mercenaries with indistinct personalities making them near-impossible to keep straight, she sets out on a nerve-racking trek in a faint echo of Sorcerer’s high-stakes commute. Thin ice has rules and terrors all its own, however, maximized through Berg’s suspense-forward direction. The team’s only chance to traverse the miles of unsteady ground is via skating, and if cracks should start to spiderweb beneath them, they must immediately distribute their weight by flopping down on their belly. In both cases, the unyielding anxiety that disaster could strike at any moment clashes with how clumsy this all looks to an outside observer. Sometimes amusing and sometimes alarming, at least this friction sets this suicide squad apart from their many forebears, whose cliches are embraced readily and often ineptly. (The obligatory scene in which the gang bonds over a fireside chat about what they’ll do when they are free comes way ahead of schedule, before we have had the time to care whether these characters live or die.) Curiosity eventually gets the better of the drafted soldiers, and they learn that their payload touted as an end to the war could very well be – because it’s a biological weapon. An “are we the baddies?” crisis of conscience follows, stuffed down by Caroline in single-minded pursuit of her child. The less-than-shocking revelation that awaits her at the base camp will change her mind, waking her up to the fact that people in positions of authority will not hesitate to screw over even those most allegiant to their orders. It’s a valid critique in general, but made in the context-free vacuum of this anonymous war, the sentiment loses its impact. The confused ethical mathematics of the foolhardy final act, under which Caroline can rationalize mass death as a complicated grey area whereas lying is the last straw, fritters away the pressure that’s mounted over her frostbitten schlep. A last-ditch effort to dispose of the viral bomb she regrets delivering attempts to maintain momentum, to little avail. The scramble through industrial corridors plays as bland and commonplace in contrast to the precision and novelty of the trembling segments on the water. Besides, by that juncture, we’re too preoccupied pondering what this is all for. A pacifist parable taking a brave stand against nothing, totally removed from the sociocultural landscape of today’s Sweden, it sounds out like one of Caroline’s screams into the howling Scandinavian wind – impassioned, futile, heard by no one.

3/17/2022,"In a bustling auction house in Coventry warring bidders are raising their hands. Suddenly a restless figure emerges, and tension breaks the sense of flow in the room. “I must have this one, Mr Trumbull,” he says, pointing at the picture on display. “You know how this works, Mr Ladislaw, it’s an auction,” reprimands the auctioneer. If those names sound familiar, that’s because these are much-loved characters from one of the UK’s most celebrated novels, Middlemarch by George Eliot. The auction house is in Coventry’s historic Drapers’ Hall, the characters are played by local people as well as professional actors, the townspeople are audience members, and the dramatic tension just witnessed is a key plot point. To commemorate the 150th anniversary of Eliot completing Middlemarch and Coventry’s designation as city of culture, five venues across the Midlands city will in April play host to an immersive theatre production, The Great Middlemarch Mystery, which reimagines the novel as a murder mystery. The audience start and end at the same points, but will create their own journey through the story as they move between locations such as the Green Dragon pub, an ornate Wetherspoon’s where they can order pints; Mrs Vincy’s elegant Georgian home; a bazaar where there’s knitting and gossiping to join in on; and a bank where they can withdraw Middlemarch currency. At the end, audience members will be invited to share their clues to the mystery. “There’s drama, fun, participation, narrative and love affairs across all the spaces. Whichever route you take, it will be impossible to know what’s happening everywhere. You’ll have an entirely different experience,” said director and lead writer Josephine Burton. Burton runs Dash Arts, which specialises in interdisciplinary, interactive productions, and said her work is about creating other worlds for audience members to discover, an artistic skill of which she considers Eliot to be a master. “The audience will step across the threshold to the performance space. They will be part of the world, they are complicit in the show.” Burton adapted the novel to work across five spaces and updated it to 1982, a period resembling the world in flux in the novel’s original setting between 1829 and 1832. Middlemarch grappled with industrialisation, the train network and the Victorian era, while in the 1980s factories were closing, the Falklands war was raging and Thatcherism was reshaping the political landscape. But the dialogue cleaves to the original, and many of the novel’s themes translate as easily to the present day as they do to the 1990s, including a scene that has parallels with the Covid-19 pandemic, in which one character is quarantined with a disease. Burton is especially interested in the questions Middlemarch raises about the role of community, and the dual meaning of provincialism in the book as both disparaging and empowering. “It’s the community that’s grappling with change, that exposes the problem and tried to mend it. It’s a real celebration of the community here.” Burton said that in the wake of Brexit she was especially drawn to the theme of the outsider in Eliot’s work, exemplified by Will Ladislaw’s Polish heritage. She feels the play looks at the tension between people in a community who bring about change, such as Ladislaw’s desire to hold those in power to account as a journalist, and those who are frightened and resistant. There are some small updates to tackle aspects of identity and community unexplored in Middlemarch, for example, Mrs Vincy is from Jamaica in an interracial marriage. Burton wanted to ensure that Coventry, which is Eliot’s birthplace and thought to be the inspiration for Middlemarch, played a key role. Many of the cast are local people, who have shared memories and photographs from the early 1980s, with the city’s thriving club scene and colourful fashions informing the production. This feeds into Burton’s collaborative approach to rehearsals, in which the cast workshop ideas and improvise an atmosphere she hopes will engage the audience. At a rehearsal for the auction scene, they exchange anecdotes, reflecting on everything from the speed of auctions and their poker-style mind games, to insights gleaned from Antiques Roadshow by Mr Trumbull, played by homeless local Steve Hands. “We want to make it fun, interactive, playful and collaborative,” said Burton.",Arts/Books,Immersive show turns Middlemarch into 1980s murder mystery,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/17/the-great-middlemarch-mystery-immersive-show-coventry-george-eliot
3/17/2022,"The American blockbuster stars David Harbour and Bill Pullman are to share the stage in London this summer for the world premiere of a family drama by Theresa Rebeck. Mad House, directed by Moritz von Stuelpnagel, presents a rancorous reunion in rural Pennsylvania for three siblings who gather at the bedside of their dying father and anticipate their share of inheritance. Harbour – whose screen credits include Suicide Squad, Hellboy and Stranger Things (as police chief Jim Hopper) – described Mad House as a “blistering new dark comedy” that he was excited to bring to London. “It features two of my favourite things: the abyss of madness that lies at the pit of every family as they stare blankly, incomprehensibly into the nature of our fleeting existence, and real estate.” The West End production begins previews on 14 June at the Ambassadors theatre, which is currently presenting a revival of Mike Bartlett’s comedy Cock by Marianne Elliott. Harbour has appeared in plays by Shakespeare, David Mamet and Tom Stoppard in the US. In 2005, he starred with Kathleen Turner in a Broadway production of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? by Edward Albee that transferred to London the following year. Pullman, whose US theatre credits also include Mamet and Albee plays, appeared in a 2019 production of Arthur Miller’s All My Sons at the Old Vic in London. His film credits include Trouble (2017), written and directed by Rebeck. Pullman and Harbour previously starred together in the film The Equalizer. Rebeck and von Stuelpnagel’s past collaborations include the 2018 Broadway production Bernhardt/Hamlet, starring Janet McTeer as the French actor Sarah Bernhardt as she takes on the role of Shakespeare’s tragic prince. Rebeck said of Mad House: “There are those projects when the stars simply align, and to see David and Bill together on stage is beyond my wildest dreams. I’m very much looking forward to being back in the rehearsal room with Moritz.”",Arts/Stage,David Harbour and Bill Pullman bring ‘blistering’ comedy Mad House to West End,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/17/david-harbour-and-bill-pullman-bring-blistering-comedy-mad-house-to-west-end
3/17/2022,"The summit of Catbells – a fell in the Lake District – is a distinctive bulge that paws at the sky, before slightly drooping to one side, like the tip of a Smurf’s hat, only less severe. It’s early February when my parents and I find ourselves walking in weather typical of the Cumbrian winter; it is, mostly, gusty and wet, so my waterproof trousers balloon in the wind like a double-pronged windsock. But there are brief moments of calm, such as on our way to Maiden Moor, another fell, when we turn to look back at Catbells’ summit and see the sun momentarily overcome the cloud, illuminating the scenery around us. A rainbow manifests, then quickly fades away. It is fleeting, but beautiful. It’s taken me over 20 years to reach this summit, thanks to a tantrum at the age of eight, some yards from the top, on my first attempt. At the time, I hated walking, and berated my parents whenever they dragged me out on to the fells at the weekend. Believing it to be the ultimate protest, I lay down on the ground, declaring I would not go any further. My family went on without me. They collected me on their way down. (My parents would like to stress that I was in sight at all times during my demonstration.) From the summit, I look back over the ridge we’ve just walked along, its grassy slopes laden with the brown fronds of dead bracken. Bassenthwaite, the Lake District’s only official lake by name, lounges in the distance. When I’m in London, where I now live, I often feel miserable in the bad weather. But here, I’m grinning in the rain. On my right lies Derwentwater, a three-mile-long expanse peppered with tiny islands, among fields, woodland and fells. “It’s just around the corner!” my mum used to tell me, whenever I asked – yet again – how far away the summit was. “Don’t you feel a sense of achievement?” she’d puff proudly at the top, and I’d glare at her as if this person innocently dressed in Berghaus and a woolly hat was responsible for all the world’s ills. Skulking in the Lakes was a theme of my upbringing in Cumbria. I thought walking was boring and uncool, preferring trips to the cinema with friends. When I moved to London, aged 18, I saw it as an escape. The countryside had been stifling and lonely, particularly as a teenager struggling with my sexuality. I didn’t miss it for years. Instead, I threw myself into London life: parties, new people, gay bars and, finally, things to do at the weekend. In my early 20s, something started to shift. I think, ultimately, it took leaving for me to realise the exceptional nature of the place I’d always taken for granted. That, and I grew up a bit. London is my favourite city, but its bad parts began to grate on me. It is polluted, and expensive, and you can cry on a bus and nobody will come to comfort you. Back in the capital after the holidays, I missed the clean air, friendliness and quiet. I began to thrive on the physical challenge of fell walking, relishing the peace that arrives after a hailstorm. I found joy in things that surprised me, like scaling a fell in thick mist only to stumble across a tarn unexpectedly, or hear a beck flowing somewhere nearby, just hidden from view. There were specific moments such as, a few years ago, when my family and I were descending Helvellyn in poor visibility and the clouds started to clear in front of us, smudging into the sunlight, like we were walking into an oil painting by Turner. A couple of years ago, I got hiking boots for my birthday and set out to bag the Wainwrights. That is, a challenge to climb 214 peaks in the Lake District, all but one above 1,000ft (305 metres), as meticulously described by the fell walker Alfred Wainwright in his handwritten pictorial guides. So far, I’ve done 52. Still, I used to hate those guides. When we reached a fell top, my dad would pull the book from his rucksack, reading aloud Wainwright’s reflections to my brothers and me – these range from heartfelt to cutting – adding his own terrible jokes or inserting us into the descriptions to check if we were still listening. Now, the Wainwrights are a love I share with my parents, who have completed them all. I even like it when dad reads out Wainwright from the top. Throughout the pandemic, walking in the Lakes has made things feel more normal. In that first summer, as restrictions eased, weekends were spent ticking off Wainwrights. It was a return to my childhood, only this time I liked it: the packed lunches, pub gardens and alfresco toilet breaks with views over Buttermere. There were the navigational woes: climbing every mound and touching every cairn on a ridge to make sure you reach the true summit. (There is nothing worse than climbing a fell, with all the physical exertion that entails, only to later find out you missed the summit by a few metres.) “The hills have a power to soothe and heal which is their very own,” said Wainwright. When I’m mired in anxiety or consumed with depression, fell walking can seem counterintuitive – especially if it’s raining. But I always feel better afterwards. If bad things happen in my life, or I feel it’s just stagnating, walking gives me a simple purpose: to get from one point to another, or back to the start again. More than once, it’s hauled me out of a rut. If nothing else, it is a distraction: heartbreak is harder to be sad about when you’re keeled over and exhausted on the steep slopes of Skiddaw. (As Wainwright said of another fell: “One can forget even a raging toothache on Haystacks.”) The Lakes have been my constant, through the best and worst times in my life. I’ve devoured cheese-and-pickle sandwiches on a sunny High Pike summit while completely in love. I’ve also sat, cradling my knees, looking over Windermere from Orrest Head, where Wainwright famously fell in love with the Lakes, on the anniversary of a friend’s death. As a landscape, it ranges from astoundingly beautiful to bleak, even dangerous. You can stroll under clear blue skies, casually admiring the Herdwick sheep, purple heather and scree, only to find yourself suddenly plunged into a thunderstorm. (If you do go fell walking, make sure you check the forecast and wear proper gear.) It is inspiring – a catalyst for conversations with family, friends and strangers. Perhaps most importantly, walking here is a huge privilege.There are no tantrums any more. Last month, I was sitting on top of Arnison Crag with my mum, eating satsumas and drinking tea from a flask in the winter drizzle. It is a small fell, not particularly impressive when pitted against the big guns of Scafell Pike or Blencathra. But it reminded me of how I’ve grown to love something in a way that continues to surprise me. With Ullswater stretched out below us, I felt calm, happy and brimming – like my mum always said – with a sense of achievement. Blencathra Blencathra, my favourite mountain for its fantastic views, is also known as Saddleback for the distinctive shape of its summit, a name my parents like to shout excitedly when they spot it from the A66 going towards Keswick. From this road, the peak looks magnificent, particularly when the top is dusted with snow. It actually has six summits, the highest being Hallsfell Top, with Wainwright recording more ascents up this fell than any other. These include Sharp Edge, overlooking Scales Tarn, a knife-edged ridge only to be attempted in good conditions and even then with care. The White Horse Inn at the base of Blencathra is worth a visit afterwards. Coledale HorseshoeOne of my happiest memories is doing this more than nine-mile route, bagging seven Wainwrights, on an unseasonably hot day with my parents in September 2020. Also known as the Coledale Round, it was a long slog, sweaty and draining, but it was a welcome holiday from the seemingly never-ending terrors of Covid-19 in which we were engulfed at the time. Once down, we had a great meal at the nearby Coledale Inn, sitting outside in the day’s last sunlight. Holme FellI did this fell on a sunny day with my mum a few years ago. It was a turning point for me as it was here that I fell in love with walking in the Lakes. We climbed it because, on her first attempt, mum accidentally didn’t reach the true summit on the southern end (she went to a second top instead, Ivy Crag, which somewhat misleadingly boasts a large cairn). It’s a dinky hill, just 317 metres in height, but despite its size, it commands impressive views over Coniston Water.

3/17/2022,"I am a widow of 71 living on my own and in poor health and have had no heating downstairs since early December. I have a British Gas HomeCare policy, but it seems incapable of fixing the problem. I have had two power flushes, a new radiator, new pump and a leak caused by a visiting technician. The last abortive visit left me in tears and my mental health is very frail.HF, Leeds British Gas has made and kept appointments to resolve the problem, although with some long gaps. You had to wait two weeks for the first power flush after technicians were unable to get your living room radiator working, and nearly three weeks after that for the radiator to be replaced in January. What’s concerning is that, despite 10 visits, the company couldn’t rectify the fault. It’s a remarkable coincidence that, the day after I contacted the press office, the problem was identified. A blocked pipe had prevented the system flowing. It was fixed the same day. British Gas tells me that it had to eliminate all possible causes, and had provided a fan heater to keep you going. It has offered you £250 as a goodwill payment for the delays. It says: “Our engineers attended each time the customer called, as we were determined to get this fixed.

3/17/2022,"Hello, I’m Warren Murray with the things that are making headlines this morning. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has touched down on British soil for the first time since she was detained in Iran six years ago. Wearing a blue dress and a yellow scarf, the colours of Ukraine, Zaghari-Ratcliffe stepped off a plane at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire in the early hours of this morning. Alongside 44-year-old Zaghari-Ratcliffe as she disembarked was fellow British-Iranian Anoosheh Ashoori, 67, who was also released from jail in Iran on Wednesday. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was seen hugging and carrying her seven-year-old daughter, Gabriella, inside the airport reception building where they were surrounded by other family members, including her husband, Richard, who campaigned for years for her release. Gabriella was heard asking “is that mummy?” as her mother disembarked the flight. Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori had been accused of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government and of spying respectively. As part of years-long negotiations, the UK is understood to have agreed to pay £393.8m owed to Iran since it cancelled an order of Chieftain tanks after the overthrow of the Shah in the revolution of 1979. A third British detainee, Morad Tahbaz, has been released from prison on furlough but remains in Iran. All three deny the charges. Liz Truss, the British foreign secretary, said on Thursday morning that the government would “continue to work intensively” for the freedom of Tahbaz. Iran is treating Tahbaz, 66, as an American citizen, even though he was born in Hammersmith, west London, and holds US, UK and Iranian citizenship. The Tahbaz family told the Guardian they felt “let down and betrayed by the British government … The British now just say he is an American problem.” ‘Weapons and sanctions’ – Volodymyr Zelenskiy has likened the “siege of Mariupol” to Leningrad while promising that “every Russian soldier who lays down his arms will get a chance to survive.” In a video address, the Ukrainian president said: “The Russian army is suffering losses that it did not see in Syria or Chechnya; that Soviet troops [didn’t have] in Afghanistan.” Joe Biden has called Vladimir Putin a “war criminal” as Ukrainian officials accused Russian forces of further atrocities in Mariupol, including an airstrike on a theatre where hundreds of displaced people were believed to have been sheltering and a strike on a swimming pool where pregnant women and young children had gathered. Zelenskiy’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba has said the “fierce resistance” of Ukrainian forces and citizens is forcing Russian negotiators into concessions, whether the Kremlin admits it or not. In a CNN interview, Kuleba discussed what was needed to strengthen Ukrainian negotiators’ hand: “Weapons and sanctions, and the rest will be done by Ukraine.” Keep up with developments at our live blog. Second job curbs dumped – Plans to cap MPs’ earnings from second jobs have been dropped, only months after the issue plunged the government into crisis, the Guardian can reveal. Boris Johnson pledged to clamp down after the Owen Paterson lobbying scandal and furore over Geoffrey Cox earning nearly £6m as a lawyer since joining parliament – voting by proxy on days he was doing paid work. Now, the government has told the Commons standards committee it no longer backs limits on hours or amount of work. The government said it would support reforms to restrict the type of outside work, but did not set out what these restrictions should be, other than banning “paid parliamentary advice, consultancy, or strategy services”. In contrast, the Committee for Standards in Public Life has suggested an “objective means of setting reasonable limits” on earnings by MPs from second jobs. ‘Denial of structural racism’ – Ministers will drop the term black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME), more closely scrutinise police stop and search, and draft a model history curriculum to teach Britain’s “complex” past in response to the Sewell report on racial disparities. Launched as a response to the Black Lives Matter protests, the report caused controversy when it was published last year for broadly rejecting the idea of institutional racism in the UK. In the government’s response, called Inclusive Britain, ministers acknowledge racism exists but stress the importance of other factors. Taiwo Owatemi, Labour’s shadow equalities minister, said the report still “agrees with the original report’s denial of structural racism. Boris Johnson’s Conservatives have once again failed to deliver meaningful action.” The report sets out a long list of policies, some new and others already in place. Pensioners mired in poverty – One in five pensioners – more than 2 million people – are living in relative poverty in the UK, according to the Centre for Ageing Better’s annual State of Ageing report, published today. It says inequalities within older generations are some of the most extreme in society: the wealth of the richest 20% doubled between 2002 and 2018, while that of the poorest 20% fell a third. In a YouGov poll, more than 80% of respondents said the government was failing to ensure a decent life for older people. Ministers meanwhile are under growing pressure to soften the impact of the cost of living crisis amid fresh warnings that millions of low-income households risk sliding into further debt, hunger and poverty. More than 50 charities are urging ministers to uprate all benefits in line with inflation, which is projected to be running at 7.25% by April, instead of the planned benefits increase of 3.1%. Spies in UK undisturbed – New laws to make it easier to expel Russian spies and other foreign agents need to be urgently speeded up in light of the Ukraine crisis, opposition parties have said, with the UK lagging behind other nations in tackling interference. Laws forcing foreign agents to sign a register were promised in last year’s Queen’s speech. The government fast-tracked its economic crime bill to help speed up sanctions against oligarchs this week, but the bill to deal with espionage has never been published, even in draft form. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, the US has expelled 12 Russian diplomats that it accuses of being spies; at the same time the UK has not expelled any diplomats or spies. People in Britain have been signing up in their thousands to offer a place in their homes to those seeking refuge from the war on Ukraine. Recent government policy sits at odds with this spirit of generosity, says Amelia Gentleman.

Jürgen Klopp promised Manchester City a “proper fight” for the title after ruthlessly efficient Liverpool pulled to within a point of the longstanding league leaders with a 2-0 win over Arsenal. In the Champions League, Chelsea survived a scare as Christian Pulisic and César Azpilicueta helped fend off Lille to progress to the last eight as the club’s off-field turbulence continues. Three late goals earned Villarreal a stunning 3-0 second-leg victory at Juventus to condemn the Serie A side to a last-16 exit for the third successive season. Manchester United are monitoring Thomas Tuchel’s situation at Chelsea as they intensify their search for a new manager and also have Sevilla’s Julen Lopetegui on their shortlist. Joe Root scored his 25th Test century but Dan Lawrence was out to the last ball of the first day of the second Test against West Indies as England reached 244 for three at stumps. Emma Hayes cautioned that Chelsea have the tougher run in after her side cut Arsenal’s lead at the top of the Women’s Super League to two points with a comfortable 3-0 defeat of Everton. None of the four tennis grand slam tournaments will feature extended final sets any more after it was announced that a 10-point tie-break will be enforced. And the RSPCA is prosecuting the West Ham defender Kurt Zouma and his brother Yoan under the Animal Welfare Act, the charity has said, after a video emerged last month of a cat being kicked. The Federal Reserve raised US interest rates for the first time since 2018 yesterday and promised another six hikes this year. Today it is the turn of the Bank of England’s policy committee who must decide whether tackling inflation with another rate increase is the priority, or whether raising UK borrowing costs for a third time in succession risks tipping us into recession. The pound could benefit from the latter scenario and is up slightly today at $1.316 and €1.193. The FTSE100 is down 0.6% in futures trade. With the war in Ukraine relegated to the second spot in most papers, the Times’ splash headline says: “Free at last, Nazanin will ‘learn to be happy again’” alongside a picture of her on the plane out of Iran. The same picture dominates the front page of the Guardian as well, under the headline “Zaghari-Ratcliffe released after six years in Iran jail”. The Mirror goes with a domestic angle: “Home … for a nice cuppa” after her husband said she was looking forward to one. The Telegraph says “‘Mummy really is coming home’” and the Daily Mail also likes the family line with the splash headline “Mummy’s home at last!”. The Express speaks to the picture of Zaghari-Ratcliffe with the headline “Smile that says: I’m free”. The i’s headline is almost the same while its main story is “Russia bombs theatre being used as shelter”. The Financial Times has “Zaghari-Ratcliffe released from Iran after UK pays $530m debt”. But it too leads on Ukraine with “Moscow and Kyiv explore neutrality plan in peace talks”. The Metro leads with “Nazanin jets home”.
