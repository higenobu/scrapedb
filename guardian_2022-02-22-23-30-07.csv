2/22/2022,"The National Portrait Gallery and BP have announced they will not extend their partnership beyond December 2022, when their contract comes to an end. “The gallery is hugely grateful to BP for its long-term support of the BP portrait award,” said Nicholas Cullinan, the director of the National Portrait Gallery. “Its funding for the award has fostered creativity, encouraged portrait painting for over 30 years and given a platform to artists from around the world, as well as providing inspiration and enjoyment for audiences across the UK.”  BP has sponsored the award for 30 years, but the partnership has been the subject of numerous protests as part of a protracted and high-profile campaign against big oil’s involvement in the arts. Notably, in 2019, five past winners of the Turner prize – Antony Gormley, Rachel Whiteread, Anish Kapoor, Gillian Wearing and Mark Wallinger – were among a group of almost 80 leading artists, including winners of the BP portrait award, who wrote to Cullinan calling on him to cut ties with BP. They said it was necessary to ensure the gallery remained a “forward-looking institution that’s on the right side of history”. The following year, BP was dropped from the judging panel of the £35,000 portrait award for the first time since 1997. Louise Kingham, a BP senior vice-president, said on Tuesday: “We are immensely proud of our role in championing British arts and culture for over 30 years, but the BP of today is a very different company from when we first started our partnership with the National Portrait Gallery. As we transition to become net zero by 2050 and help the world get there too, we must look at new ways to best use our talent, experience and resources.” The pressure group Culture Unstained said it believed the move was “clearly a vote of no confidence in BP’s business” by the gallery. Jess Worth, a co-director of the group, said: “The company spent 30 years painting a picture of itself as a responsible philanthropist but it is rapidly running out of places to clean up its toxic image. Even now it continues to invest millions in finding new sources of oil and gas, which will only push the world deeper into climate breakdown.” The campaign against fossil fuel corporations’ sponsorship of the arts has continued to escalate in recent years as concerns mount over the scale and severity of the climate crisis. When BP and Tate ended their 26-year sponsorship deal in 2017, the company blamed what it called an “extremely challenging business environment”. In 2019, the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company ended their sponsorship deals with Shell and BP respectively, after Mark Rylance resigned from the RSC in protest over their continued relationship, which he said allowed the oil company to “obscure the destructive reality of its activities”. A month later, National Galleries Scotland said it would sever its ties to BP over climate concerns. BP continues to sponsor the British Museum, now under the helm of its new chair, George Osborne. Last week, more than 300 archaeologists and historians wrote to the museum’s trustees calling on them to drop the company, while activists staged the latest in a string of protests by presenting fake “Stonehenge drilling plans” to visitors. The relationship between the British Museum and BP has drawn condemnation from the museum’s own staff and led in part to the resignation of one of its trustees, the novelist Ahdaf Soueif. Worth said: “The pressure is now on the British Museum, which is currently deciding whether to renew its own BP sponsorship deal, to get on the right side of history.”",Arts/Art and design,National Portrait Gallery and BP to cut ties after 30 years,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/22/national-portrait-gallery-and-bp-to-cut-ties-after-30-years
2/22/2022,"Why do some recipes specify self-raising flour and others plain flour and baking powder? Can I replace one with the other?Lily, Manchester “I’ve often wondered why people select self-raising flour,” says John Lister, founder of British miller Shipton Mill. His conclusion? A combination of convenience, tradition and classic recipes (hello, sponge cake) that call for it. “It’s a uniquely British thing,” agrees Edd Kimber, author of One Tin Bakes Easy. “We’re not the only country that uses the stuff, but we are the only country that seems to have such a unique relationship with it, which leads to questions such as Lily’s.”  Let’s back up, though, and get a quick refresher on what self-raising flour actually is. All-round baking guru Dan Lepard explains: “It’s a mixture of plain flour with bicarbonate of soda [sodium hydrogen carbonate], plus an acid powder [usually monocalcium phosphate in supermarket mixes].” And this is not an ingredient to stock up on, says Sarah Lemanski, founder of Nova Bakehouse in Leeds: “The raising agent in self-raising flour can deactivate over time, so its reliability and consistency can be a bit up and down.” And, as we’ve noted here before, baking is alchemy. “It’s good to know how much baking powder you’re putting into a recipe, and with self-raising flour you just don’t know,” says Guardian columnist Benjamina Ebuehi, whose new book, A Good Day To Bake, is released next month. “Some recipes get you to add baking powder for extra lift, anyway, so in my opinion it just starts getting faffy.” For this reason, Ebuehi doesn’t have much truck with the self-raising stuff at all: “I’m team plain flour with baking powder; it saves space – I don’t like having two flours at home – and you can use plain flour in everything.” Plus, adds Lemanski, who also prefers plain flour plus a raising agent, you then have ample opportunity to play around with different types of flour: “You would never see self-raising rye flour [in the shops], for example.” Of course, Lily could sub in plain flour (and a raising agent) for self-raising in her bakes, but, as Kimber points out, things can get a little tricky, because “no one really agrees on what the ratio of flour to baking powder is”. Lepard suggests either combining 250g plain flour, 10g cream of tartar and 5g bicarbonate of soda, then sifting “two to three times to mix evenly”, or simply 250g plain flour plus 15g baking powder (or about three teaspoons). Lemanski, meanwhile, adds a smidge less (“5% of the weight of flour should be baking powder”); Nigella Lawson on Nigella.com goes for 150g plain flour plus two teaspoons of baking powder; Ebuehi 150g plain flour plus one and a half teaspoons; while Kimber admits he “changes it all the time”, because what you make and what ingredients you use will play a part, too. “Sometimes, a recipe already contains an acidic ingredient, such as buttermilk or soured cream, so it needs only bicarb to rise,” Lepard explains. “Whereas a banana cake, where the fruit makes it very alkaline, often needs extra acidity, so additional baking powder can be helpful.” Essentially, like all of us from time to time, bakes might need an extra lift, so be prepared to experiment.

2/22/2022,"In a beige office void somewhere in California, ace but amoral telemarketer Kasey Miller (Lamorne Morris) works the phones, talking people into buying expensive cable TV packages they don’t really need. He’s smooth and considered a superstar salesman around the office – but lately he has mislaid his mojo and one day young rival Barry (Woody McClain) beats him by a single sale on the leaderboard. Determined to take back his crown, Kasey dawdles after quitting time even though he has a date with his ex-girlfriend Christine (Alisha Wainwright) that evening. Using a sneaky, internet-enabled sales technique to try to trick Asa (Jackie Earle Haley) into thinking he’s an old friend who just happens to be a telemarketer, Kasey thinks he’s made a sale – only to find out that Asa was not the hillbilly-accented fool he appeared to be on the phone and was on to him from the start. Then Asa shows up at Kasey’s workplace, armed and angry because of a personal tragedy that he believes was caused by a telemarketer’s phone call.  This comedy-drama appears initially to be a cheap bill of goods, but turns out to be more droll and insightful than it looks, and willing to go down some dark paths as it gets closer to the end. A debut feature for writer-director Khaled Ridgeway, it puts most of the pressure on its star to charm the audience while still being a sleazebag practised in the arts of the world’s most annoying profession. Luckily, Morris has the shtick down pat and sparks well with the fine supporting cast that includes not just Jackie Earle Haley but also another thrice-named Haley, former child star Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense), who, judging from this and the TV series What We Do in the Shadows, has turned into a wicked comic character actor.

2/22/2022,"Iwas once the only passenger on a four-hour “ghost flight” across Europe. I loved it – the exclusivity, the speed, even the meals. But that was 45 years ago, when flying was quite rare and seemed glamorous. The idea that air travel might one day threaten future generations seemed very far-fetched. But the facts change. Travel is now a global commodity, and aviation is the world’s fastest growing major source of climate breakdown emissions. Flying empty or near-empty planes around just to hold on to landing slots at airports now seems close to “ecocide” – an act of deliberate destruction of the environment. A staggering 15,000 ghost flights flew from UK airports between March 2020 and September 2021.  These flights are a symptom of an unregulated, highly protected industry encouraged to keep growing without responsibility. Before the pandemic, Britain had the third largest aviation sector in the world after the US and China. It has some of the most travelled people in the world, and its emissions from flying are the third highest per capita. The government subsidises the industry with huge tax breaks and handouts. And while the rest of UK industry has helped to reduce emissions by around 42% in the last 30 years, aviation has been allowed to double its own. In 2019, aviation accounted for 8% of all UK emissions, and it shows no sign of slowing soon. The global industry may be slowly improving its efficiency, by about 2% a year, but passenger growth still surges ahead. Globally, a staggering 38,000 large planes are now expected to be flying regularly within 10 years – and the UK government expects more than 230 million more passengers a year will be using UK airports by 2050. Never mind that the government’s climate adviser, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), say that passenger numbers should not grow more than 25% and that there should be no more net airport growth. Heathrow, Gatwick, Leeds-Bradford, Manston, Bristol, Luton and others are now planning to expand, in the teeth of local opposition. We are to be Runway Britain. But while airlines give the impression of being for everyone, they are largely used by the few. Aside from the air and noise pollution close to airports, which disproportionately affects low-income groups, just 1% of people take 20% of all English international flights and 10% take more than half. There is a limit on how much carbon we can emit without catastrophic climate consequences; the more the aviation industry is allowed to grow, the more all other sectors of the economy will have to cut back. To its credit, Britain also has a legal duty to cut its emissions to reach net zero by 2050, one of the most ambitious decarbonisation plans in the world. This means a 78% cut on 1990 figures by 2035, and 100% by 2050. The government is relying mostly on techno-fixes and imagines a heat pump for every house, electric cars on every drive, better quality housing, mass tree planting and farming reform – but above all, it expects the market to magically deliver the necessary cuts. It is obviously make-believe, and groups including Friends of the Earth and Client Earth are now taking ministers to court, saying the strategy is too theoretical and is not properly backed up with policies, money or commitment. Besides, they say, unlike cars or houses, there is no techno-fix for aviation. The industry knows this, and talks up emission-trading, switching to renewable fuels, carbon capture and storage, and even one day building lighter electric or green hydrogen planes. But few of these nascent technologies are likely to be working at any significant scale in the next 20 crucial years, by which time we must have slashed emissions heavily to avoid more catastrophic storms, flooding, droughts and heatwaves. Meanwhile, the public is fobbed off with talk of airlines paying others to make extra emissions cuts, and being on the brink of breakthroughs. The bitter truth is that UK aviation, as it exists today, and tackling the climate crisis are incompatible, something recognised by the CCC. It warns that, left unchecked, the linked aviation, tourism and airport industries will blow UK climate targets away. We need to reduce emissions from air travel fast – and that can only mean fewer flights. That will require proper interventions, such as a tax on frequent flights, the removal of tax breaks on aviation fuel, and the adoption of the “polluter pays” principle. Any money raised could help provide better public transport, cheaper rail fares and alternatives to flying, The timing for action is good. Two years of travel restrictions and rising awareness of the climate crisis may have convinced many of us that Zoom is here to stay, Britain is beautiful, trains to France and beyond are good, and the days of shopping trips to New York, weekend skiing in Italy and second holidays in Thailand are over. It might also have convinced the industry that the best way to start addressing its impact on climate change is by banning all ghost flights.

2/22/2022,"We’re nearly two hours into our conversation when Morgan Khan starts to cry. I have just mentioned that for decades now, the UK charts have been filled with the children of Street Sounds, the dance music compilation series he began 40 years ago. “It’s true,” he says, when he has composed himself. “I’m balding, with a pot belly and a small dick. That’s me being objective. But what you said is true.” Without ever writing a song, without ever fronting a group, Khan changed the face of British music. He was one of the first cheerleaders for Britfunk, the first to bring electro and hip-hop to the UK, and one of the pioneers of house. Every root of the dance music that has blossomed in mainstream pop grew in the UK thanks to Khan transplanting it from the US.  How far ahead of the curve was he? He licensed the first rap smash, Sugarhill Gang’s Rapper’s Delight, to release in the UK. He was the first person to bring Dr Dre over, as part of the World Class Wreckin’ Cru, to play Khan’s 1986 UK Fresh show. When Mory Kanté’s Yeke Yeke became the first African hit to break in Europe in 1987, Khan had released it on Street Sounds New Africa two years earlier. In 1982, Khan – then 23 – launched Street Sounds, a compilation series that democratised the dance music underground. Suddenly, tracks that had been available only on import in specialist shops, bought by DJs and serious clubbers, were available to all. For the price of one import 12-inch, you could get 12 tracks on an album. Street Sounds had its own section in the high street music chain Our Price; I vividly recall the albums being loaned around by kids at my school in Slough. “What was being released in the UK was palatable, watered-down soul,” Khan says of the early 1980s. “It wasn’t street. Everything that was happening in the clubs was on import, and that was the idea that sparked it. Buying imports was costing me half my weekly salary. I thought: these records are never going to see the light of day in Europe. Why don’t I go to the US – to the labels, producers and artists – and let me license them for Europe? “Actually, 90% of them didn’t even know where Europe was. They just wanted to sell in the tristate area [New York, New Jersey, Connecticut] and California. For them, getting an advance for a territory they would never sell to anyway … bonus! No one had approached them before. The majors hadn’t caught on to Black music, street music – they jumped on later. When they saw what we were doing, it became harder for me, because they would hand out million-pound cheques. But before that they didn’t realise the sales potential.” Khan was born in Hong Kong to Anglo-Indian parents. His father was an airline pilot who later lost his job for diamond smuggling, and his family came to the UK when he was nine. He entered the music business – not his parents’ dream for him – in the late 70s, first as a DJ. “They loved my energy,” he tells me. “I’d put on a record, leave the booth and come out and dance with the crowd, then run back in.” Next he was a post boy at the Pye label – at one point, without a home, he spent several months living in their offices – before working in their promotions department on disco releases. “The treatment of dance music was the epitome of racism,” he says. “There was a racist attitude to Black music: it wasn’t ‘serious’ music.” The N-word, he says, was used offhandedly around the industry. “It was just standard vocabulary. It was inbred into the system that you could talk like that, act like that, be like that.” But it was Pye that first sent Khan to New York, where he did the deal with Joe Robinson of Sugar Hill Records to release Rapper’s Delight in the UK. “After the deal was done, Robinson handed me a bundle of notes and said, ‘Khan, buy some fucking clothes. You’re representing me now.’ That night a gift arrived at my hotel room.” He pauses for effect. “She was beautiful.” He pauses again. “All we did was watch TV and eat cheesecake. I was 21.” From Pye, he set up his own imprint, R&B Records, which introduced the pioneering funk band Imagination. He left that because he felt his backers weren’t paying him enough, and with the support of Maurice Oberstein, who ran the UK arm of CBS, he set up Street Sounds for US tracks and Street Wave for his own artists. “He took that music into the suburbs and the small towns, so it was everywhere,” says the DJ Greg Wilson, who adds that Khan was “priming people” for the late 80s rave scene. “A lot of those people had come out of listening to the Street Sounds Electro compilations. Electro was raw – it really swept everything away that went before and began a new world for dance and pop.” It was, Khan and Wilson agree, dance music’s punk moment: nothing would be the same again. Khan’s A&R process for the compilations was simple. First, he would go to clubs: “You’ll see the records that, within a bar, had people not just dancing but getting down.” Second, he would go to New York. “I was flying to New York most Fridays and coming back on Mondays. I was collecting the quarter-inch master tape. There were no mobile phones. There was no digital file. I would go see some labels, fly back again. Cut the record on a Monday, have a test pressing by Wednesday because we were doing such volume. We’d be in production for Friday.” Promotion was from the ground up. “I used the pirates and the club DJs. All these little pirate stations around the UK were starting to play Black music; the legal stations wouldn’t touch it. Each month, 3,000 vinyls went out, maybe more. If the top DJ in a town plays it, other DJs hear it and buy it and play it – you get it to the kingpin in each area, and they are effectively your promotions department.” The first Street Sounds compilation sold around 10,000 copies, Khan says, but they soon started flying off the shelves, aided by the switch to text- and graphic-based designs for the Electro series, designed by John Carver and reminiscent of Neville Brody’s work for The Face, which gave the records a sleek modernity that the first covers – with graffiti-style writing – didn’t have. Suddenly, new names were being talked about in schools around the UK: Newcleus, Rammellzee, Cybotron, Run DMC. By the sixth Electro compilation in 1984 the direction of travel was clear: it featured both sides of the Roxanne wars between the Real Roxanne and Roxanne Shante, as well as Whodini and Doug E Fresh (credited as Dougy Fresh). Hip-hop was the new thing, and Khan was already on top of it. He was soon overreaching, though. His plans to make his organisation the British Motown (“Detroit comes to West Acton!” as one ad campaign enthusiastically put it) foundered on the fact that while the Street Sounds albums were selling – the series racked up 57 chart entries in five years – he was less successful hitting the singles chart with artists he signed directly to Street Wave. The UK Fresh festival at Wembley Arena in 1986 – by a huge distance, the biggest hip-hop show in the UK to that point, and for several years after – was a hit, but his Street Scene magazine, centred on Black music, emptied the coffers. Still he persisted, and in a remarkable comeback he set up a new label, Westside, in 1987, and won the licenses to release the Chicago house labels Trax and DJ International in the UK, only to be gazumped by those with deeper pockets. “We had done the hard work and then the artists started signing major deals. What chance did I have? Pete Tong was flying off to Chicago with a blank chequebook: how do you compete?” Street Sounds still exists – it’s an internet radio station – and Khan wants to get back to releasing compilations of the most exciting underground dance music from around the world again, maybe four a year. He’s angry that others are celebrated for bringing hip-hop and house to the UK mainstream: “People credit Paul Oakenfold and Pete Tong and it fucks me off. People have tried to change the history and it hurts me.” Wilson thinks that’s because the collapse of Street Scene left others out of pocket and resentful of Khan for their losses, and because a new generation came to dance music in the late 1980s and simply assumed Ibiza in 1987 was the year zero, with no appreciation of what had come before. “There’s nothing about him in the books, even though he’s a central figure in the history of British dance culture,” Wilson says. “He was young, he was brave, and he was prepared to put his reputation on the line.” He’s older now, but Morgan Khan remains indefatigable, and convinced talent will surface through the dross – and that he will find it next. “I’m appalled by bedroom DJs who put out these shit beats and everyone thinks they can make music,” he says, before smiling. “But the next Prince is out there.” Sugarhill Gang – Rapper’s Delight (1979) “Credited for introducing hip-hip to the mainstream, even though it was preceded by the Fatback Band’s King Tim III (Personality Jock) by a few months. Sylvia Robinson, the producer, wanted to capture on vinyl the phenomenon of rappers performing live at block parties in the Bronx – its significance still can not be overestimated.” Imagination – Body Talk (1981) “My first own label release, on R&B Records. Imagination dared to be different with their signature sound and overtly camp stage persona; groups like Imagination proved that Britfunk and soul could take on the Americans, and laid the foundations for the next generation of groups like Soul II Soul.” Hashim ‎– Al-Naafiysh (The Soul) (1983) “A new tour de force would soon empower the music of the street, and Al-Naafiysh (The Soul) epitomised this new music: electro, the driving force behind the emergence of B-boy culture, breakdancing, graffiti and the boom box.” Cheryl Lynn – Encore (1983) “CBS UK had decided not to release this track as a single, despite the pedigree of the artist, and that the song was written and produced by the highly successful Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. They said they did not see it as a hit, or [an] artist worth promoting – you can deduce why. I persuaded them to license me the track and through our very capable street promotions network, we took Encore into the Top 75. I then received a call: it was suggested by certain powers to halt the chart progress so as not to further embarrass CBS UK to their American bosses.” Rose Royce – Magic Touch (1984) “Rose Royce had substantial hits in the 70s with lead singer Gwen Dickey, including Car Wash and Wishing on a Star. Unfortunately, Gwen leaving the band coincided with a change in the style of music being played in clubs. Magic Touch did nothing in the US, whereas in the UK, Street Wave had a huge record – the track has become a staple anthem at soul weekenders ever since.” Joe Smooth – Promised Land (1987) “House music was born in Chicago, and Promised Land was the quintessence of the genre at its birth. The soulful vocals of Anthony Thomas over the straight four-to-the-floor bass drum became the template for pop music today.” Humanoid – Stakker Humanoid (1988) “The fact we produced, recorded and mixed this track at our studios in Ealing always gives me a sense of pride – we created one of the biggest records of the acid genre, and opened the door to the acid-jazz movement.”",Arts/Music,"‘What chance did I have against Pete Tong?’ Morgan Khan, the unsung hero who made the UK dance",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/22/morgan-khan-street-sounds-compilations-unsung-hero-made-uk-dance
2/22/2022,"As soon as Vladimir Putin ordered his forces to enter eastern Ukraine under the guise of “peacekeeping”, there was pressure on the west to fulfil its promises to punish Moscow with tough sanctions, amid fears the incursion is a precursor to a more sweeping invasion. The US initially responded with limited sanctions targeting investment and trade related to the Russia-controlled territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, while on Tuesday Boris Johnson announced what he called the “first barrage of UK economic sanctions against Russia”.  The prime minister told the Commons that the measures, imposed on five Russian banks – Rossiya, IS Bank, General Bank, Promsvyazbank and the Black Sea Bank – and three high net-worth individuals including Putin’s friend Gennady Timchenko, were just the “first tranche” and promised more. So who might be next? Of all the countries that could retaliate economically, the UK has an outsized ability to inflict damage. There is thought to be more Russian gold in London than in any other city in the world. Not only in the Chelsea mansions that house the families of oligarchs, which have earned the capital the “Moscow-on-Thames” nickname, but on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Since the 1990s, companies whose shares are traded in Moscow have turned to London to raise money through what are known as secondary listings. They range from state-backed oil and gas producers Rosneft and Gazprom, to state-run banks VTB and Sberbank, to independent mining companies such as Nornickel that have no state ownership. In total, 31 Russian companies are listed on the LSE, with a combined market value of £468bn, according to the data company S&P Global. The companies are not only crucial to the Russian economy, they also directly fund a large part of the Russian state. London-listed Russian oil, gas and mining companies paid their government £39bn in taxes in 2020, according to a Guardian analysis of payments to government disclosures. That revenue is hugely important to the Putin regime: Russia spent £41.7bn on its military in 2019, 11.4% of government spending, according to the World Bank’s latest figures. A statutory instrument laid before parliament earlier this month gave the UK government the power to impose sanctions on those “carrying on business of economic significance to the government of Russia” as well as companies supportive of the Russian government, and sectors of strategic significance, including energy, mining and financial services. While not every Russian-linked company will be a target for sanctions, the reality is most of the London-listed companies potentially fall within the definition of having economic or strategic significance to the Russian government. And in the US a draft sanctions bill explicitly names 12 Russian banks as potential targets for sanctions and would also give powers to hit companies in the oil and gas and mining sectors. No companies or individuals have yet been designated, but the new legislation now allows for the speedy designation of a very broad range of individuals and entities. Under the most extreme scenario, companies operating in the UK, US or EU – including most of the world’s major financial institutions – could be forbidden from any transactions with sanctioned entities. That could mean the indefinite suspension of their shares, and an inability to issue new debt or shares in London. The most obvious companies of economic significance to the Russian government, based on tax take, are Rosneft, Gazprom and Lukoil, who together paid 3.2tn roubles (£31bn) in tax and other payments to the Russian government in 2020. All three are primarily listed on the Moscow Exchange, but have secondary listings in London. Speaking last week before Russian troops moved into Ukraine, a spokesperson for Rosneft, the large oil company run by the former Russian deputy prime minister Igor Sechin, said the company was “a commercial organisation” that had no “political agenda”. The spokesperson highlighted a list of major institutional shareholders ranging from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock in the US to British asset managers such as Schroders and abrdn, and said it made “a notable contribution to the sustainability of the UK energy market”. Gazprom, Norsnickel and Sberbank did not comment. Lukoil and VTB did not respond to requests for comment. Some companies with primary London listings also operate in sectors deemed by the UK government as strategically significant to Russia. The FTSE 100 steelmaker Evraz is incorporated in London but has significant operations in Russia. The company is 29% owned by Roman Abramovich, the Russian owner of Chelsea football club. Lawyers for Abramovich, speaking last week before Russia declared that it recognised the independence of the two self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine, disputed that he or Evraz fitted the criteria for potential designation for sanctions. They added: “It would be ludicrous to suggest that our client has any responsibility or influence over the behaviour of the Russian state.” The London-based aluminium miner En+ Group(£1.1bn), which raised $1.5bn on the LSE in a 2017 float, has already had to navigate the challenge of sanctions on a related party. It is part-owned by Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch on the US sanctions list since 2018. En+ managed to escape US sanctions by reducing Deripaska’s ownership to 45% and appointing other directors in a plan devised by Greg Barker, a former UK energy minister and Conservative peer who is the company’s chair. The company is still thought to make monthly reports to US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. En+ declined to comment. However, Deripaska has taken legal action to challenge US sanctions. He has denied any wrongdoing and said US allegations against him were based on “false rumour and innuendo”. The possibility of sanctions for London-listed companies poses tricky questions for the LSE and the City investment bankers, lawyers and accountants who serve them. Russian companies are likely to account for only a small portion of the LSE’s fee income, but it has in the past enthusiastically welcomed Russian money – even going so far as mounting a roadshow to Moscow in 2011 to drum up custom. That mood has changed along with the geopolitics since the Crimea annexation, but Russian companies have still raised an average of $1.8bn a year on the LSE between the 2014 Crimea invasion and 2021, or £14bn in total, according to data from Dealogic. Sanctioned companies can, depending on the details, be suspended from trading and removed from the LSE’s stock market indices – although there is little in the rules on what would happen if suspensions were to last years. The London Stock Exchange Group declined to comment.",News/Business,Russian sanctions: who has been hit and who might be next?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/russian-sanctions-who-has-been-hit-and-who-might-be-next
2/22/2022,"West Midlands police have asked a judge to exclude reporters from a hearing in which they will attempt to force a journalist and former MP who exposed the Birmingham Six’s wrongful conviction to reveal his source material. The force have applied for an order under the Terrorism Act 2000 compelling Chris Mullin to hand over material, including notebooks, from his 1985-86 investigation into the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings, which killed 21 people and injured more than 200.  The Birmingham Six were jailed for life in 1975 but their convictions were quashed in 1991, five years after the publication of Mullin’s book Error of Judgement: the Truth About the Birmingham Bombings. In 2018, West Midlands police announced a decision to reinvestigate the case. Officers believe Mullin has interviews that could confirm the identity of a surviving member of the IRA gang now thought to be behind the pub bombings. Relatives of victims of the bombings have criticised the former MP for refusing to disclose the names of living suspects. Journalists are professionally bound to maintain the confidentiality of sources and Mullin is refusing to disclose the requested material on the basis that it would represent a fundamental breach of this principle. The National Union of Journalists is supporting his case. West Midlands police confirmed on Tuesday that they had made submissions asking for Friday’s hearing at the Old Bailey to be held in private. They cited the need to protect the privacy of a suspect whose name may be mentioned in court who has not been charged, in line with the decision in the recent Bloomberg case at the supreme court which protects such suspects. News organisations including the Guardian, Daily Mail and Times plan to challenge the attempt to have the public, including journalists, excluded from the entirety of the hearing. The Guardian understands that Mullin wishes for the hearing to be held in public. Many reporters have risked jail for contempt of court in the past rather than reveal sources. In a significant 1996 case, the European court of human rights backed a journalist from the Engineer magazine, Bill Goodwin, after a court in Britain tried to force him to reveal a source. However, in some decisions since the Goodwin case, judges have ruled that the need for disclosure outweighed the public interest in a journalist being entitled to protect their sources.",News/UK news,Police move to ban reporters from Birmingham Six journalist hearing,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/22/birmingham-six-journalist-hearing-reporters-ban
2/22/2022,"The BBC is losing two of its leading broadcasters as the Newsnight presenter, Emily Maitlis, and outgoing North America editor, Jon Sopel, announced they are leaving the corporation to join the media group Global. The pair will front a new podcast for Global Player, host a radio show together on LBC and provide commentary and analysis for the station’s website.  Maitlis has served as the lead presenter on Newsnight, while Sopel was the broadcaster’s North America editor. The two also host the BBC’s popular Americast podcast, about US politics. Maitlis said: “We are just so delighted to be launching this brand new podcast – which will build on everything we’ve achieved with Americast over the last few years – and it will find new audiences and a new home with Global. I couldn’t be more excited.” She tweeted: “It’s an amazing opportunity to do something we all love and we are so thrilled Global is giving us the opportunity to be big and ambitious with this project.” She added: “Nevertheless, it will be a wrench to leave the BBC after 20 phenomenal years. I am so grateful for the opportunities I’ve had there. More than anything I’m grateful to have worked with the most incredible people, many of whom are dear friends. I owe my BBC colleague everything.” Sopel said: “I’m delighted to be joining Global with my great friend and colleague, Emily Maitlis. We’ve been blown away by the reception for Americast, and are so excited that Global has given us the opportunity to build on this success by creating this innovative news podcast. This is an unmissable opportunity.” He tweeted: “Some work news: @maitlis and I are going to launch a brand, spanking new podcast with @global. We’re excited to be working with them on this innovative project. Opportunities like this just don’t come along very often. But am sad to leave the BBC, which has been home for so long. “Of course, it will be a wrench to leave the BBC after nearly four decades, and have loved my time there – particularly the last seven years as North America editor. I leave with nothing but good feelings towards the corporation and wish all the best to my colleagues and friends there.” The two will be working with Dino Sofos, the founder and CEO of the audio production company Persephonica, and the former head of BBC news podcasts and creator of Brexitcast, Newscast and Americast. He tweeted: “Can’t wait to be reunited with these broadcasting legends as exec producer on this milestone moment for podcasting.”",News/Media,Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel leaving BBC to front new podcast ,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/22/emily-maitlis-and-jon-sopel-leaving-bbc-to-front-new-podcast-lbc
2/22/2022,"Two weeks ago, Electronic Arts opted not to launch a same-sex marriage story in Russia for its hit life-simulation video game The Sims 4. At a glance, this is a simple story – a game publisher refusing to compromise its art in order to comply with Russia’s controversial “homosexual propaganda” law. Yet to Russian LGBTQ+ gamers, EA’s blog post wasn’t a show of solidarity – it was a betrayal. Since 2013, it’s been illegal in Russia to “promote” homosexuality to minors. This means that any LGBTQ+ content must carry an adults-only rating. It’s a law that EA knows all too well, as back in 2014, The Sims 4’s same-sex relationships saw it slapped with an 18+ rating in Russia.  Despite its disproportionate age-gating – the game’s a PEGI 12+ in the UK – The Sims 4 became massively popular in Russia. Over the last seven years, it has amassed legions of dedicated Russian fans and streamers, including a huge LGBTQ+ following. Now, that community felt abandoned. Despite putting out pre-release trailers for the My Wedding Stories expansion in the region, on the day before launch, EA suddenly announced that it wouldn’t be available in Russia. “We have made the decision to forgo the release of ‘My Wedding Stories’ where our storytelling would be subject to changes, because of federal laws,” read a blogpost attributed to The Sims developers. “The ability to tell stories – any story – is at the core of what we do at The Sims. Holding back [characters] Cam and Dom’s story meant compromising the values we live by. We are committed to the freedom to be who you are, to love who you love and tell the stories you want to tell.” To Russian Simmers, the move felt baffling. They swiftly rallied to create the hashtag #weddingsforrussia and a Change.org petition with more than 10,000 signatures. Because The Sims 4 already had an adult-only rating in the region, the Russian Sims community strongly believed that releasing the downloadable content (DLC) wouldn’t break any laws. For Russians in the already marginalised LGBTQ+ community, seeing EA pull a game that publicly endorses same-sex marriage felt like a kick in the teeth. “Our Twitter riot is due to the fact that The Sims team, by limiting the sale of new content, is ready to discriminate against the Russian-speaking audience.” Said Russian YouTuber, JPluiy. “We are part of this community, and we are offended by what is happening at the moment. Nobody forbids [EA] to do anything. [EA] themselves turn away from the Russian queer community, which is already sitting without any rights, up to its ears in hate.” It’s a sentiment echoed by another leading Russian Sims YouTuber HoboGivi. “I was first shocked, and then furious!” says HoboGivi, who has been covering the game for eight years. “I rushed to tell my subscribers and it started a real riot. In Russia there is a law on the promotion of homosexuality, yes, but it only applies to people under the age of 18. Since The Sims 4 game is already rated 18+ in our country, EA can easily release new DLC in our country.” “It makes me feel isolated from the rest of the world, not supported by Simmers, or the LGBTQ community from other countries. It’s like everybody matters except us,” says lifelong Sims fan and proud queer gamer, Daria Sachsen. “I’m quite sure that the 18+ rating gives [EA the] opportunity to release the expansion. Our government wouldn’t be bothered right now by a single game pack after years of publishing The Sims here – there are bigger problems for them at the present time.” To Daria and many others in the Russian LGBTQ+ community, games such as The Sims offer a welcome refuge from real life’s challenges. “The Sims is one of the most popular games among our LGTBQ community,” she explains. “Everybody loves games where you can be yourself, free from the boundaries of our reality and where you can love like your heart wants to.” In 2020, Putin proposed a Russian constitutional amendment forbidding same-sex marriages, which was signed into law in 2021. This is possibly the legislation EA feared its expansion would be in breach of. Yet in the eyes of HoboGivi, even this is incorrect. “Since 2021, our country has had a constitutional amendment stating that marriage is a union between a man and a woman, but it does not affect the media space and only applies to living people and real marriage ceremonies.” After a week’s worth of relentless pressure from fans, EA finally reconsidered its stance. In a new blogpost on 16 February, EA announced that it had decided to release the expansion in Russia after all: “We’ve reassessed our options and realised we can do more than we initially believed, and we will now release The Sims 4 My Wedding Stories Game Pack to our community in Russia, unaltered and unchanged.” This is undoubtedly a victory for The Sims and the wider Russian LGBTQ+ community, vindicating the legions of fans who believed that there was no legal ground for EA’s initial stance. The question is, with no pressure on EA from the Kremlin, why did EA initially decide not to release the expansion in the region? “EA did what the players asked it to do, and that’s commendable!”, says Hobogivi. “I just hope that next time we will not have to go to such lengths to get content in our country.” This isn’t the first time EA and Russia have publicly clashed over the controversial law. In 2016, Fifa 17 drew the ire of Russian MPs by distributing free in-game rainbow-coloured uniforms, during a campaign to combat homophobia. Other games have been removed from sale in Russia. Square Enix’s first game with a trans lead, Tell Me Why, was quietly delisted from Russia’s Steam store in 2020. It is unknown whether this was advised by the Russian government, or a risk aversion strategy from Square Enix, or Steam itself. The #weddingsforrussia movement is not only a big win for an often overlooked gaming community, but also one that shows the world that for a new generation of online Russians, Putin’s laws – and the west’s assumptions – simply aren’t representative of its populace. “The Russian LGBT community is huge!” HoboGivi tells me, “Our country is changing, and the people in it are changing their attitudes towards LGBT people. Just recently, we started doing drag shows, and everyone is excited about it. We are not the people you see on American TV shows.”",Arts/Games,Gay weddings for Russia: How The Sims became a battleground for the LGBTQ+ community,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/22/gay-weddings-for-russia-how-the-sims-became-a-battleground-for-the-lgbtq-community
2/22/2022,"The largest number of British manufacturers plan to raise prices in the next three months than at any point since 1976, according to a business survey that underscores the inflationary pressures hitting the UK economy. With energy prices rocketing and wages on an upward path, the CBI said four-fifths of firms expect to increase the cost of manufactured goods in the next three months.  Not since the oil shocks of the mid-1970s has such a broad swathe of the manufacturing sector found itself needing to increase prices, pushing a net balance to +77% of firms that say prices will need to rise, up from +66% in January, according to the business lobby group. Order books remained strong in February as the global demand for manufactured goods remained healthy. By some measures the global demand for goods has increased 20% on pre-pandemic levels during the pandemic, putting upward pressure on the cost of raw materials and the price of energy on international markets. The survey showed a net balance of +20% of factories reporting rising orders, down from +24% in January. While this was the weakest reading for four months, the CBI said it was still well above the survey’s long-run average. The CBI deputy chief economist, Anna Leach, said: “Manufacturers will be buoyed up by strong order books and output growth, but amid ongoing cost pressures, almost four in five firms expect to increase prices in the next three months.” She urged Sunak to use his spring budget statement, due next month, to increase investment incentives to help manufacturers. The official annual rate of consumer price inflation rose to 5.5% in January, the highest since March 1992, while the retail prices index, which is used as the benchmark in most pay negotiations, jumped to 7.8%. The Bank of England this month predicted that inflation will peak at about 7.25% in April, when household energy bills are due to rise by more than half. Speaking at the National Farmers’ Union conference on Tuesday, the Bank deputy governor, Sir Dave Ramsden, predicted modest rises in borrowing costs to combat inflationary pressures buffeting the UK economy, but said the longer-term path of interest rates was difficult to predict because of uncertainties including the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The Bank raised interest rates to 0.5% this month from 0.25%, but Ramsden was part of a minority who warned that the Bank needed to act more quickly. Along with three other members of the monetary policy committee he voted for a bigger increase to 0.75%, which would have been the first half-point rise since the Bank was granted independence in 1997. Investors are pricing in another rate hike at the next scheduled meeting of the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) on 17 March. “Some further modest tightening in monetary policy is likely to be appropriate in the coming months,” Ramsden said. “The word ‘modest’ is significant here though – I do not envisage bank rate rising to anything like its pre-2007 level of 5% or above, let alone to the kind of levels we used to see before the MPC was formed in 1997,” he added. However, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has already triggered a raft of sanctions that could increase energy prices further, including a block by the German government on Russia’s Nordstream 2 gas pipeline to Europe’s largest economy Financial markets currently price inrates rising to nearly 2% by the end of this year – well above the levels which the Bank’s forecasts published on 3 February suggested would be needed to get inflation back to its 2% target by early 2024. “New shocks can arise – we did not foresee the recent rise in energy prices, and as we meet today the crisis in Ukraine is intensifying – and so we should remain humble about the possibility that things might turn out differently,” Ramsden said. “[This] makes it particularly difficult to make predictions about where monetary policy might be headed in the medium term,” he added.",News/Business,"UK manufacturing price pressures highest since 1976, says CBI",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/uk-manufacturing-price-cbi-bank-of-england-dave-ramsden-interest-rates
2/22/2022,"Menna Fitzpatrick and Millie Knight are to lead the biggest British Winter Paralympic team in nearly 30 years, as the final places for Beijing were confirmed on Tuesday. Fitzpatrick, who won four medals in Pyeongchang four years ago, including one gold, to become Britain’s most decorated winter para-athlete, will be joined by double-silver medallist Knight in the Alpine ski team.  ParalympicsGB finalised their numbers for the Games that begin on 4 March by adding Alpine, Nordic skiing and snowboard athletes to five wheelchair curlers already selected. It brought the total number of athletes to 25, the biggest group since Lillehammer in 1994. Fitzpatrick and Knight will be joined in the visually impaired class of alpine skiing by debutant Neil Simpson, as well as their guides. In the sitting class there will be three athletes competing at their first Games, Shona Brownlee, Alex Slegg and Dan Sheen. James Whitley will compete at his third games in the standing class. “It’s a huge honour to be selected to represent ParalympicsGB again, and I can’t wait to get out there and get started,” Fitzpatrick said. “The last two years have been disrupted due to injury and the pandemic and, with uncertainty about whether the Games would go ahead, let alone the qualification process, to have a seat on that plane is amazing. I’m super excited to travel to China as part of such an incredible team of athletes representing Great Britain.” The Nordic skiing team will be five strong, a sign of increased strength after Scott Meenagh became the first British athlete to compete in the class for 20 years in Pyeongchang. Meenagh returns for Beijing alongside fellow British forces veteran Steve Arnold and Callum Deboys in the biathlon and cross-country events. Steve Thomas will appear in a sixth Paralympic Games, having competed in sailing and ice hockey previously, racing cross-country. Hope Gordon, meanwhile, is set to become Britain’s first ever female Nordic Paralympian, by competing in the cross country. She has already represented Britain in para-canoeing. Finally, James Barnes-Miller and Owen Pick lead the snowboard team along with debutants Ollie Hill and Andy MacLeod. The ParalympicsGB chef de mission, Phil Smith, said: “We are looking forward to using Beijing to build on the success of the past two Paralympic Winter Games and further enhance our reputation as an emerging winter sport nation.”",Sport/Sport,Fitzpatrick and Knight lead biggest GB Winter Paralympic team since 1994,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/22/fitzpatrick-and-knight-lead-biggest-gb-winter-paralympic-team-since-1994
