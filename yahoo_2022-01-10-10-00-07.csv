New York is experiencing a huge surge of Covid cases linked to the Omicron variant, placing strain on hospitals and public health resources. The city has posted high rates of vaccination. Earlier, in an interview on Fox News Sunday, the director of the CDC, Rochelle Walensky, was asked about the severity of the Omicron variant compared to the Delta variant. Walensky said: “We are starting to see data from other countries that indicate on a person-by-person basis it may not be. However, given the volume of cases that we’re seeing with Omicron we very well may see death rates rise dramatically.” According to Johns Hopkins University, more than 837,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US. Around two-thirds of the eligible population is considered fully vaccinated but resistance to public health measures stoked by conservative politicians and media has dogged the federal response. Walensky also emphasised the importance of vaccination and booster shots, saying: “We have seen with the Omicron variant that prior infection protects you less well than it had … with prior variants. “Right now, I think the most important thing to do is to protect Americans. We do that by getting them vaccinated and getting them boosted.”",Health/The Guardian,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez announces positive Covid test,https://news.yahoo.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-announces-positive-233421838.html
1/10/2022,"By Tom Balmforth MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia said on Sunday it would not make any concessions under U.S. pressure at talks this week on the Ukraine crisis and its demands for Western security guarantees, and that there was a risk they might end quickly. Talks are due in Geneva, Brussels and Vienna but the state-owned RIA news agency quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying it was entirely possible that diplomacy could end abruptly after a single meeting. ""I can't rule out anything, this is an entirely possible scenario and the Americans... should have no illusions about this,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Naturally, we will not make any concessions under pressure and in the course of threats that are constantly being formed by the Western participants of the upcoming talks."" Interfax news agency quoted Ryabkov, who will lead the Russian delegation in Geneva, as saying Moscow was not optimistic going into the talks. His comments signalled an uncompromising line from Moscow at the tensest point in U.S.-Russian relations since the Cold War. Tens of thousands of Russian are troops are gathered within reach of the border with Ukraine in preparation for what Washington and Kyiv say could be a new invasion, eight years after Russia seized the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine. Russia denies invasion plans and says it is responding to what it calls aggressive and provocative behaviour from the NATO military alliance and Ukraine, its former Soviet neighbour which has tilted towards the West and aspires to join NATO. Last month Russia presented a sweeping set of demands including for a bar on further NATO expansion and an end to the alliance's activity in central and eastern European countries that joined it after 1997. The United States and NATO have said large parts of the Russian proposals are a non-starter. A senior Biden administration official on Saturday said the United States was not willing to discuss limits on U.S. troop deployments or the U.S. force posture in NATO countries in the region. It was ready, however, to talk about the possibility of each side restricting military exercises and missile deployments in the region. Russia's foreign ministry said the team led by Ryabkov had arrived in Geneva, where the formal talks are due on Monday. Russia is also due to hold negotiations with NATO in Brussels on Wednesday and at the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna on Thursday.
