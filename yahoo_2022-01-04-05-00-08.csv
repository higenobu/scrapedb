1/4/2022,"Jeffrey Epstein paid Virginia Roberts Giuffre $500,000 to settle her 2009 lawsuit, according to newly unsealed court documents. The settlement was unsealed as part of Giuffre’s civil suit against Prince Andrew, in which she is seeking unspecified damages, claiming that Andrew raped her three times when she was 17, and that she had been trafficked to him by Epstein and his accomplice, convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. A source close to Giuffre exclusively told The Daily Beast that her side is “pleased” the settlement has now been made public, especially given the relatively small amount of money paid out to Giuffre. Andrew’s side has previously claimed she was paid “millions of dollars” in various lawsuits. Ghislaine Maxwell Found Guilty For Aiding Epstein’s Teen Sex Ring The source said that Andrew’s lawyers’ claims in their legal briefs about the impact of the settlement on Andrew were “simply not accurate,” adding, “It was all a red herring. We are pleased it is out, it stops the public dissembling that people have been doing.” However, Andrew’s side is likely to argue that because Virgina Giuffre’s complaint against Epstein mentioned “royalty,” the settlement resulting from that complaint therefore applies to “royalty.” A key section of the agreement said that Giuffre agreed to “forever discharge...any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant” from future legal action. The unsealed court document also states that the agreement will “remise, release, acquit, satisfy, and forever discharge” defendants in any state or federal lawsuits filed by Giuffre and applies “from the beginning of the world to the day of this release.” “The release never mentions royalty and he could not have been a potential defendant there,” the Giuffre source added about the agreement. Giuffre’s civil suit faces a critical challenge Tuesday, when Andrew’s legal team, led by Andrew B. Brettler, will seek to have her motion dismissed, relying in part on the 2009 agreement with Epstein, which Brettler has long argued released Andrew from all legal jeopardy in connection with Giuffre. Both sides have access to the Epstein agreement, and it formed a significant part of Andrew’s initial legal brief, filed on Oct. 29. The brief says: “To avoid being dragged into future legal disputes, Epstein negotiated for [a] broad release, insisting that it cover any and all persons who Giuffre identified as potential targets of future lawsuits, regardless of the merit—or lack thereof—to any such claims.” The paperwork added: “Because Prince Andrew is a senior member of the British royal family, he falls into one of the expressly identified categories of persons, ie, royalty, released from liability under the release agreement, along with politicians, academicians, businessmen, and others allegedly associated with Epstein. “As a third-party beneficiary of the release agreement, Prince Andrew is entitled to enforce the general release contained therein.” David Boies, Virginia Giuffre’s lawyer, has previously said that the Epstein settlement is “irrelevant” to Andrew’s case. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told The Daily Beast on Monday that the expansive nature of the settlement could cause legal complications for both sides. “Guiffre’s settlement agreement is one of the broadest I have ever seen,” Rahmani said. “As a plaintiff’s attorney, I never release unknown parties or entities, especially for a mere $500,000 for sexual abuse. The language gives Prince Andrew another strong legal defense to Guiffre’s claims, in addition to the jurisdiction and other defenses his lawyers have raised.” But Rahmani added that just because the prince “may prevail on a legal grounds, does not mean he is exonerated or factually innocent of wrongdoing.” “It’s not your typical release, and I would never agree to language like this for a client unless it’s an offer she can’t refuse, which this was not,” he said. “At best, Guiffre will get a default judgment against Prince Andrew because the court can’t compel his attendance in the United States. Unless Maxwell cooperates with prosecutors, and they can independently verify the information she provides, I don’t think the Prince will receive criminal justice.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

1/4/2022,"A chat on CNN’s “New Day” Monday revolved around Republicans and their “sexual frustrations,” ultimately ending with conservative commentator Mary Katherine Ham joking that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has taken up the fight for “the plight of the super hot.”  To understand how this segment came about, turn to Ocasio-Cortez’s Twitter. She responded this weekend to right-wing criticism of her New Year’s vacation to Florida by writing, “If Republicans are mad they can’t date me they can just say that instead of projecting their sexual frustrations onto my boyfriend’s feet. Ya creepy weirdos. It’s starting to get old ignoring the very obvious, strange, and deranged sexual frustrations that underpin the Republican fixation on me, women,& LGBT+ people in general. These people clearly need therapy, won’t do it, and use politics as their outlet instead. It’s really weird.” Former Trump campaign advisor Steve Cortes had originally tweeted a photo of the Democratic representative and her boyfriend dining outdoors, observing, “1. If Leftists like AOC actually thought mandates and masking worked, they wouldn’t be frolicking in free FL. 2. Her guy is showing his gross pale male feet in public (not at a pool/beach) with hideous sandals.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Republican caucus in Congress accept the harassment of members of Congress, particularly women of color. She made the remarks in a press conference announcing a resolution to strip Rep. Lauren Boebert of her committee assignments after the Colorado Republican made anti-Muslim comments against Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. The picture Cortes shared even included a circle around the boyfriend’s foot.  Now, back to CNN.  Though Ocasio-Cortez’s tweet racked up 19,000 retweets and 175,000 likes compared to Cortes’ 3,000 and 9,000, respectively, Ham was not among those who were amused by the defense. “First of all, I woke up like this,” she joked on CNN’s “New Day.” “So I think you have the authority on people being sexually frustrated by my mere existence. It happens all the time. I’m glad to be able to discuss this important issue with you. The plight of the super hot in America has long been ignored and AOC has started a national conversation about this.” She maintained her sarcasm as she continued, even slipping in a quote from “Zoolander” before making her more serious point. “I’m goofing on this because it’s goofy, but to question the motives of every questioner you come across, I don’t think, behooves her,” Ham said.

1/4/2022,"Mercedes-Benz unveiled the Vision EQXX, an electric concept car with 620-plus miles of range. It's exceptionally efficient thanks to an aerodynamic design and lightweight materials. The EQXX previews things Mercedes may incorporate into future electric cars. Mercedes-Benz took the wraps off of a striking electric concept car on Monday. Meet the Vision EQXX. You probably won't be able to buy a Merc exactly like the Vision EQXX anytime soon. But some of the advancements Mercedes developed here could make their way into your future electric Benz. If range anxiety is the fear of running out of energy in an electric car, Mercedes wants the EQXX to be something like a chill pill. Mercedes built the EQXX to be its most efficient car ever, one that demonstrates that range anxiety will soon be a thing of the past. The Vision EQXX should deliver at least 620 miles of driving range on a full battery, Mercedes claims. That beats the rangiest electric car you can buy today (the $170,000 Lucid Air) by 100 miles. If Mercedes' claims are true, the EQXX would beat the longest-range Tesla by more than 200 miles. But Mercedes didn't just give the EQXX a gigantic battery pack and call it a day. It engineered the EQXX to deliver more range using less energy. Mercedes gave the EQXX a teardrop shape that lets it slip through the air even better than the EQS, the company's electric flagship. Mercedes says the EQXX is more aerodynamic than a football. The EQXX also gets special tires that cut down on rolling resistance... ...and lightweight magnesium wheels. Mercedes made it a point to cut weight wherever possible. It chopped out excess material and used 3D-printed parts. As a result, the EQXX weighs around 3,800 pounds, about a ton less than Mercedes' EQS sedan. The company also developed a new battery pack and drivetrain for optimal efficiency. Since the EQXX is geared more toward long road trips than track days, it makes relatively little power — just 200 horses. Solar panels integrated into the EQXX's roof can add up to 25 kilometers (around 15 miles) of range under ideal weather conditions. It wouldn't be a Benz if it didn't have a comfy, luxurious cabin. And the EQXX has that in spades. But the EQXX's interior, just like the rest of the car, is all about efficiency. Mercedes filled the cabin with sustainable materials that it says lower the car's overall carbon footprint. The door pulls are made from a vegan silk-like material. The EQXX also sports vegan leathers made from mushrooms and cacti. Some surfaces are made from recycled plastic bottles. The Vision EQXX also offers a sneak peek at the future of Mercedes' in-car screens. The concept has a single massive display that stretches 47.5 inches across the dashboard. We already knew Mercedes is getting serious about electric cars. The impressive EQXX concept is yet another sign that the company's battery-powered future is looking bright.

1/4/2022,"The U.S. is currently experiencing an all-time high in COVID-19 cases and Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade has identified the real culprit: Testing. In the morning show’s first broadcast of the new year, Kilmeade echoed former president Donald Trump by declaring that there is just “too much testing” going on. “There’s way too much testing!” he exclaimed, adding, nonsensically, “There’s testing to do testing, testing to go back to school, testing to go back to work, we can’t afford it!” Meanwhile, the CDC has been under fire over the past couple of weeks for not requiring infected individuals to provide a negative COVID test before returning to work after just a five-day quarantine. Kilmeade went on to complain that everywhere he goes he has to look at “people in pup tents waiting in the cold, waiting in long lines, waiting for a test they more than likely don’t need.” But instead of calling on the Biden administration to improve its testing infrastructure, the host seemed to be suggesting that almost all of the COVID testing happening right now is unnecessary. Fox News Host Advises Viewers Against Boosters as COVID Rages “You said you were going to kill the virus, not the economy, you did both!” Kilmeade added, inadvertently giving President Biden credit for ending the pandemic. “Congratulations! Every single step of the way, you have let the American people down.” When he was finally done, Kilmeade received a “Bravo!” from his co-host Pete Hegseth, who added, “There’s nothing I could add to that at all, well said summing it up.” But then, because he couldn’t help himself, he went after Biden for putting too much stock in science. The “too much testing” talking point continued later in the day when Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo called for a massive scaling back in his state’s testing apparatus even as cases continue to hit record highs there. As Omicron surges, Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo says the state is working to ""unwind"" the COVID ""testing psychology"" that the federal government has prioritized. pic.twitter.com/cju0o1uVJm — The Recount (@therecount) January 3, 2022 “We need to unwind this testing—sort of planning and living one’s life around testing. Without it, we’re going to be sort of stuck in the same cycle,” Ladapo said during a press conference with Governor Ron DeSantis. “So it’s really time for people to be living, to make the decisions they want regarding vaccination, to enjoy the fact that many people have natural immunity. And to unwind this preoccupation with only COVID as determining the boundaries and constraints and possibilities of life. And we’re going to start that in Florida.” As physician Ashish K. Jha put it on Twitter, “This is completely backwards,” adding, “In fact, with ubiquitous testing, we can keep infections low and safely get back to our lives.” Brian Kilmeade Snipes at Steve Doocy for ‘Recommending’ Vaccines Read more at The Daily Beast.

1/4/2022,"Colorado investigators believe a wildfire that devastated communities ahead of the new year could have stemmed from a shed fire on land occupied by members of fundamentalist Christian sect the Twelve Tribes. “The fire originated somewhere in that neighbourhood,” Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said Sunday at a news conference. “There was a viral video that was posted of a shed on fire.” He added that investigators did not know whether or not “that shed started the fire or whether it was secondary”, and that finding the cause of the fire was “complicated and it’s under snow”. “We will sort it out,” he told reporters. “It’s an active, open deal and the outcome of that investigation is vital, there is so much at stake. So we are going to be careful.” A resident of the neighbourhood meanwhile told The Denver Post that he thought he witnessed the beginning of the blaze next-door to him on Thursday. Mike Zoltowski said he asked three people sheltering from strong winds at a property owned by the Twelve Tribes about a small fire in a field. The individuals told him that “One of our dwellings caught on fire”, it was reported. “I don’t want to speculate,” he said on Sunday. “It’s still under investigation, but there is no possible way the fire started from any other place”. The religious sect reportedly denied wrongdoing, despite other accounts of illegal burnings on the same property not far from Boulder. The Twelve Tribes, started in the 1970s in Tennessee, is a fundamentalist sect which believes in a return to first-century Christianity and believes all other denominations are fallen. According to a 2018 article in the Southern Poverty Law Center’s magazine, the “Christian fundamentalist cult born in the American South in the 1970s, is little-known to much of the country, and on first impression its communes and hippie-vibed restaurants and cafes can seem quaint and bucolic. “But beneath the surface lies a tangle of doctrine that teaches its followers that slavery was “a marvelous opportunity” for black people, who are deemed by the Bible to be servants of whites, and that homosexuals deserve no less than death.” The group has previously been investigated for flouting child labour laws and has butted heads repeatedly with authorities in Germany for its insistence on homeschooling. Authorities have meanwhile confirmed that almost 1,000 homes burned in suburbs between Denver and Boulder, and that more than 6,000 acres were scorched. Two people were still missing on Monday, the same day a Disaster Assistance centre opened in Boulder County “to help people who lost homes in or were displaced by the fire with a range of services including property loss and filing claims for assistance, financial and food assistance, mental health supports, transportation, and more,” a press release announced. Crews continued working to restore power and gas, with more than 18,000 space heaters distributed to residents as of Sunday. Also Sunday, FEMA Director Deanne Criswell - a firefighter who spent much of her life and career in Colorado - toured the devastated regions with Colorado Governor Jared Polis, who declared a state of emergency Thursday. “We’re bringing our federal teams together to work side-by-side with the state, the county and the city officials that have been impacted to develop what that housing strategy is going to be, both the immediate needs to put people into safe places as well as what the long-term housing needs might be as we work together to rebuild these communities,” Ms Criswell said. CU Boulder, after a combination of Omicron and the fires, has announced the spring semester at the university remote as the region struggled to figure out logistics. Displaced families of elementary and high school students were attempting to figure out what to do, as well. Gov. Jared Polis told her rebuilding will be a tough decision for a lot of people. “Some people will settle elsewhere, but those who want to stay in the same school will have to find somewhere nearby.” Superior Mayor Clint Folsom, who has been living in a hotel since his family lost three of their four houses, told CBS that he had “teared up at times at the extent of loss.”",U.S./The Independent,"Shed fire on land of ‘cult’ eyed as cause of devastating Colorado blazes that destroyed 1,000 homes",https://news.yahoo.com/shed-fire-eyed-cause-devastating-163646024.html
1/4/2022,"COVID cases are skyrocketing nationwide, to unprecedented levels—and whether or not this new Omicron strain is less severe, you don't want COVID. So how can you stay safe? And where is Omicron going to strike next? Former head of the FDA Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who sits on the board of Pfizer, appeared on Face the Nation yesterday. Read on for five life-saving pieces of advice—and to ensure your health and the health of others, don't miss these Sure Signs You've Already Had COVID.   Although cases are skyrocketing, and hospitalizations are rising, they are not rising in kind. That said, some areas will be hit hard by illness. ""This does appear to be a milder strain of coronavirus,"" said Dr. Gottlieb. ""And we also have a lot of immunity in the population. I think places that have been hard hit early, like the Mid-Atlantic, the Northeast, New England, Florida, parts of the Pacific Northwest, are maybe two weeks away from peaking, but the rest of the country probably faces a hard month ahead of us,"" he said. ""I don't think you're gonna start to see a national peak until we get into February, because there's parts of the country that really haven't been hard hit by Omicron yet. And the virus will spread around in the country.""   Omicron ""appears to be more of an upper airway disease and a lower airway disease,"" said Dr. Gottlieb. ""That's good for most Americans. The one group that that may be a problem for is very young kids, very young children, toddlers who have trouble with upper airway infections and you're seeing more group-like infections and bronchiolitis in New York City, among children. So that will be a challenge for young kids and we are seeing rising hospitalizations among that pediatric segment."" RELATED: 8 Tips You Must Follow to Avoid COVID, Say Doctors    ""Cloth masks aren't going to provide a lot of protection,"" said Dr. Gottlieb. ""That's the bottom line. This is an airborne illness. We now understand that. And a cloth mask is not gonna protect you from a virus that spreads through airborne transmission. It could protect better through droplet transmission, something like the flu, but not something like this coronavirus.     ""We have to recognize this has not been a benign disease in young children,"" he added. ""There's a perception that young children haven't been hit hard to date from coronavirus. That's just not true. We've recorded more than 600 pediatric deaths from COVID over the last two years. To put that in perspective, we have one death from flu and the pediatric population last year. ….So over a period of time when we've done a very good job protecting children, generally from respiratory infections, we've recorded more than 600 deaths from COVID against three deaths from flu. So this is affecting children and particularly young children. This new strain could have a predilection again for the upper airway, which could be a bigger challenge in young kids because of the way that it binds to, um, the airway cells in terms of going back to school. I think the prerogative clearly is to try to get schools reopened. We shouldn't be doing preemptive school closures in my opinion, but there will be situations where we have reactive school closures when there are large outbreaks."" RELATED: Here's How You Can Catch COVID Even If You're Vaccinated    ""I think certainly the February timeframe is appropriate in terms to when we're gonna pass through this Omicron wave across the United States,"" said Dr. Gottlieb. ""Now this is a big country. This will affect different parts of the country at different points in time. But if the UK is any guide, London's already peaking. If South Africa is any guide, this is about a two month epidemic wave from start to finish. And so parts of the country that were affected earlier, like New York. probably are gonna start peak in the next two weeks, other parts within the next four weeks. So I think certainly by the end of February, we will be through this.""    Follow the public health fundamentals and help end this pandemic, no matter where you live—get vaccinated or boosted ASAP; if you live in an area with low vaccination rates, wear an N95 face mask, don't travel, social distance, avoid large crowds, don't go indoors with people you're not sheltering with (especially in bars), practice good hand hygiene, and to protect your life and the lives of others, don't visit any of these 35 Places You're Most Likely to Catch COVID.","Health/Eat This, Not That!",Virus Expert Says Omicron Will Strike These States Next,https://news.yahoo.com/virus-expert-says-omicron-strike-173010229.html
1/4/2022,"Marjorie Taylor Greene, the right-wing congresswoman famous for her support of conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, Covid-19, and other issues, has been temporarily suspended from Facebook hours after being banned permanently from Twitter. The congresswoman confirmed her suspension in a Telegram post, calling the company’s decision “beyond censorship of speech”. Her suspension appeared to result from the same post that got her a final, fifth strike from Twitter which led to her account’s deactivation: A post claiming that vaccine injury and death reports gathered by a reporting service operated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proved that the government was ignoring large numbers of deaths resulting from the Covid-19 vaccine. In reality, the data used by the congresswoman in her post contained anecdotal reports unverified by the FDA; clinical trials have shown the vaccine can have mild side effects, and a handful of serious side effects that are much rarer. Ms Greene originally posted a message on both platforms pointing to a large number of reports of injury or death among Covid-19 vaccine recipients as evidence that the federal government was ignoring “extremely high amounts of Covid vaccine deaths”. The data, though anecdotal and not verified by any government agency, has nevertheless become a favourite among anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists attempting to assert that the jabs are more dangerous than doctors and federal public health experts say. The congresswoman’s Twitter post was far from her first spreading misinformation related to Covid-19, and she received at least two temporary suspensions last year for the same issue. She was also penalised by the company in January of 2021 for spreading false claims about the 2020 election. “We permanently suspended the account you referenced (@mtgreenee) for repeated violations of our Covid-19 misinformation policy. We’ve been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy,” a Twitter spokesperson told The Independent on Sunday. Ms Greene retains access to Twitter through the account for her congressional office, @RepMTG, which is largely operated by staff. The account banned on Sunday was a personal Twitter account operated by Ms Greene herself. Twitter could end up taking similar steps by issuing strikes and eventually banning Ms Greene’s congressional Twitter account if she were to continue her spread of misinformation via that account. The congresswoman responded to news of her ban on Telegram yesterday as well; the platform is quickly becoming a favourite of right-wing Americans. “[Rep] Maxine Waters can go to the streets and threaten violence on Twitter, [Vice President] Kamala [Harris] and [Rep] Ilhan [Omar] can bail out Black Lives Matter terrorists on Twitter, CNN and the rest of the Democrat Propaganda Media can spread Russia collusion lies, and just yesterday the Chief spokesman for terrorist IRGC can tweet mourning Soleimani, but I get suspended for tweeting VAERS statistics,” she said on Sunday. The comments of Ms Greene and other anti-vaccine Republicans has led to a deep divide in the Trump-controlled GOP, wherein former President Donald Trump and other party leaders have encouraged supporters to take the jabs while more right-wing members of the House have spread a variety of falsehoods about the shots in an attempt to cast doubt on their safety and efficacy. Just a few days before Ms Greene’s Twitter ban, a Twitter account run by Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee engaged in a similar attempt to trash the vaccines championed by Mr Trump as part of his “Operation Warp Speed” initiative. The divide over vaccine acceptance has now become one of the most significant schisms in the GOP at both the statewide and national level as some Republican governors such as Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and Larry Hogan of Maryland have wholeheartedly embraced the shots while others, such as Florida’s Ron DeSantis, continue to resist the idea of even promoting their effectiveness against Covid-19.",Politics/The Independent,Marjorie Taylor Greene suspended from Facebook hours after Twitter ban,https://news.yahoo.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-suspended-facebook-183925286.html

1/4/2022,"Ghislaine Maxwell's brother told The Sunday Times that the British socialite will not cooperate with investigators. Maxwell was convicted on five of six charges for helping Jeffrey Epstein run a decades-long sex trafficking ring. Legal experts told Insider that Maxwell's only options for a lighter sentence are to appeal or cooperate. Ghislaine Maxwell will not reveal information about others involved with helping disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein run his decades-long sex-trafficking network, her brother told The Sunday Times. Maxwell, a longtime employee and girlfriend of Epstein's, was convicted on five of six charges on December 29. Maxwell was found guilty on three conspiracy counts, one separate sex-trafficking count, and a count for transporting a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity. She now faces up to 65 years in prison for those charges, and still faces a second trial for charges related to lying under oath in a deposition. Legal experts previously told Insider that Maxwell's only options after her conviction are to fight her case on appeal, or start cooperating with investigators to receive a lighter sentence. The names of several high-profile people, including Prince Andrew, appeared in evidence during Maxwell's trial. Her brother, Ian Maxwell, told The Sunday Times that Ghislaine Maxwell maintains her innocence and has no plans to pursue a plea deal with prosecutors. ""Prosecution confirmed no plea bargain offers were made or received"" before the trial, Ian Maxwell told the newspaper. ""I expect that position to be maintained."" Ghislaine Maxwell is currently incarcerated in solitary confinement at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. US District Judge Alison Nathan has not set a sentencing date in the case. Ian Maxwell told The Sunday Times that his sister is ""understandably subdued,"" but ""strong in spirit"" about her imprisonment, and will be appealing her conviction. Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on child sex-trafficking charges. Ian Maxwell told the newspaper that his sister ""is not now, nor has ever been, a suicide risk."" ""She knows there are many people, including her family of course, who love and support her and who believe in her innocence,"" Maxwell said. Ghislaine Maxwell has been the central figure in the investigation into Epstein's sex-trafficking operation since his death. Neama Rahmani, a formal US attorney and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, previously told Insider that prosecutors would need to be ""really sensitive"" about giving Maxwell a break in exchange for cooperation because Epstein was still awaiting trial on serious charges at the time of his death. ""You don't want to give Maxwell a free pass, because she was instrumental to the abuse,"" Rahmani told Insider.

1/4/2022,"Sen. Manchin tanked passage of Biden's agenda last year, largely due to the enhanced child tax credit. Axios reported Manchin is open to resuming negotiations if the CTC is cut or gets a lower income caps. Manchin has remained adamant the CTC should be limited and has also proposed work requirements. While Democratic lawmakers were disappointed to end 2021 without passing President Joe Biden's sweeping climate and social-spending package, many of them remained confident they would get it done in the new year. However, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin — the centrist Democrat holding out on the package — doesn't appear to be easing up on his demands. Axios reported on Sunday that Manchin is open to revisiting negotiations on the Build Back Better agenda if the White House removes the monthly child tax credit payments from the package completely, or significantly lowers the income cap for eligible families, citing people familiar with the matter. This is a demand Manchin has long held. The expanded child tax credit would have allowed parents who earn below a certain income to receive monthly payments of $300 per child under 6 and $250 for children between 6 and 18 for another year, but the last payment went out in December and has yet to be renewed due to Manchin's resistance. ""Do you believe people making $200,000 and $400,000 should still get the child tax credit the same as someone making $50,000, $60,000, or $70,000 that really needs it?"" Manchin previously said. As Insider previously reported, the $200,000 and $400,000 levels are where the child tax credit phases out faster for individual or joint tax filers, and households making more than those levels each year already aren't able to receive the full credit. As Insider's Joseph Zeballos-Roig reported, Manchin's objections to the monthly payments extend beyond an income cap — he also wanted to institute work requirements to receive the federal benefit and has raised concerns parents would spend the payments on drugs. It's unclear when, or if, Biden's agenda will make it to his desk for signature, but given Democrats need 50 votes to pass the economic package, Manchin's support is crucial. The Washington Post reported that prior to sinking negotiations before Christmas, Manchin made a $1.8 trillion pitch to the White House that excluded the enhanced child tax credit, reflecting his firm stance the monthly payments need to be altered or removed altogether. Still, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told his Democratic colleagues last month that despite Manchin's resistance, he will bring Build Back Better to a vote early this year to deliver on Democrats' promises. Schumer wrote in a letter that ""nearly all of us were disappointed by the decision to delay floor consideration of the Build Back Better Act because Senator Manchin could not come to an agreement with the president. However, neither that delay, nor other recent pronouncements, will deter us from continuing to find a way forward."" ""We simply cannot give up,"" he added.

1/4/2022,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz on Monday took the wraps off its battery-powered VISION EQXX prototype which it says will have a range of more than 1,000 kilometres (km) per charge, taking a big stride in its electric vehicle (EV) ambitions. Daimler, soon to be rebranded Mercedes-Benz, announced plans in 2021 to invest more than 40 billion euros ($45 billion) by 2030 to take on Tesla in an all-electric car market, including building eight battery plants. From 2025, all its new vehicle platforms will only make EVs, it has said. The VISION EQXX, dubbed the most-efficient Mercedes-Benz ever built, will have energy consumption of less than 10 kilowatt hours (kWh) per 100 km, said Daimler. Tesla's Model S 60 currently consumes 18.1 kWh over the same distance, data on its website shows. ""The Mercedes-Benz VISION EQXX is how we imagine the future of electric cars,"" Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Kaellenius said. Daimler will test-drive the prototype before the middle of the year on various types of terrain, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Markus Schaefer told journalists on Monday. Some components of the prototype would be available in Mercedes-Benz vehicles within two to three years, Schaefer said. However, the CTO declined to specify when the 1,000 km-range battery would be market-ready. ""We will likely be the first to show a 1,000 km-range car in real life, with such a small battery,"" Schaefer said. When such a vehicle would go on sale is a ""market decision"" to be determined once the carmaker had established how much range customers expected and what they would be willing to pay, he said. The prototype, built within 18 months, ""puts an end to range anxiety,"" Mercedes-Benz said, referring to one of the key obstacles for why EVs have not been in higher demand. This required developing a new battery pack, which the company says would fit into a compact vehicle and whose energy density - measuring how much power batteries can hold compared to their size - stands at close to 400 watt hours per litre.

1/4/2022,"The Trump family was supposed to turn over records and testimony to the New York Attorney General surrounding the Trump family’s alleged tax dodging. Predictably, they didn’t. So now, investigators are turning up the heat on former President Donald Trump himself, Don Jr., and Ivanka. The three Trump family members are being added as “respondents” in an ongoing legal fight with New York Attorney General Leticia James, according to a document filed in New York state court Monday morning. In the court filing, the AG’s office said it recently issued subpoenas for the former president and two of his adult kids “for testimony and documents ‘in connection with an investigation into the valuation of properties,’” but that “a dispute has arisen.” Now the state’s top prosecutor wants to force them to cooperate. Prosecutors Pit Trump Org Dynasties Against Each Other The law enforcement agency did not provide comment. Neither did the office of the former president. Since James took office in January 2019, she has been making good on campaign promises to subject the family business, the Trump Organization, to scrutiny for its wildly different real estate valuations. Documents show the family persistently tried to reduce their tax bill by claiming advantageous valuations for several properties, like an opulent forested estate and a golf course north of New York City. According to court records, the AG’s investigators have also been probing potential bank fraud. Investigators are focusing on the former president and his kids, because Donald Trump led the firm with a tight grip until he entered the White House in 2017, when his children assumed more control. In September, the state judge overseeing the case unsealed a court order that gave Trump and his top lieutenants an ultimatum: comply with subpoenas or pay for a third party to do it for you. Monday’s court filing now shows the degree to which Trump and his kids have resisted personally subjecting themselves to examination. Inside the Trump Org Money Man’s Interview With Investigators Tensions flared last month when Trump personally sued the AG in federal court, using the lawsuit to smear the civil investigation as a political prosecution. Unbeknownst to the public, the AG’s office in December had been sending subpoenas to the former president, Don Jr., and Ivanka seeking to have them sit down for sworn depositions, according to a source familiar with the matter. The Trump family is expected to soon file a document in court to block the subpoenas, according to the filing, which was also signed by two lawyers representing the Trumps. Ronald P. Fischetti is an attorney hired to represent the former president, and Alan S. Futerfas is a lawyer at the Trump Organization. A different Trump family member tried to put up resistance in the past—and it didn’t pan out. Trump’s third son, Eric Trump, fought off a subpoena until he eventually buckled and sat down for a deposition on Oct. 5, 2020. This civil investigation is separate from the joint criminal investigation into tax fraud that’s being run as a joint operation between the AG and the Manhattan District Attorney. That other case resulted in an indictment against the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. His trial is set for later this year. Read more at The Daily Beast.
