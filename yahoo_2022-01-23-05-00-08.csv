1/23/2022,"A woman in Pennsylvania has experts flummoxed by the animal she discovered outside of her home. Christina Eyth rescued the animal earlier this week near her home in Fairfield Township after finding paw prints outside of her door. Eyth followed the tracks, assuming they had belonged to her neighbor's dog after they had gotten loose. The tracks ended up leading her to directly an unidentified animal, which Eyth said was exhibiting ""scared behavior."" “I peeked outside the door and that’s whenever I noticed the animal on my left hand side and it was so scared and so cold and shivering,” Eyth recalled in an interview with NBC News. ""... All I could think about is 'This animal needs help.'"" Rescuing the animal was one thing: Eyth was able to lure the animal into her basement and out of the cold. Since then, though, the animal has been a mystery. Eyth said that first, she thought the creature might be a coyote or a dog. After calling Wildlife Works, a local rescue, and transferring the creature to their facility for care, there have only been more questions. Morgan Barron, a certified wildlife rehabilitator at Wildlife Works, had trouble identifying what this animal could be and told NBC News she couldn’t “definitively say what it is.” “But to err on the side of caution since they can carry rabies and since it might be a coyote, we can keep it here, get genetic testing done, and then kind of go from there,"" Barron explained. Barron said that since the animal's behavior is on the timid side and it isn't exhibiting signs of aggression, she believes that the animal may be a dog. In the meantime, the animal is currently being treated for mange and is being kept in isolation. Related:",U.S./TODAY,A Pennsylvania woman rescued a ‘scared’ animal.

1/23/2022,"Brian Laundrie sent texts between his and his fiancé's phones to trick police into thinking she was alive, per the FBI. Gabby Petito's body was discovered at a Wyoming campsite in September. Laundrie's remains were found in a Florida reserve in October, along with his backpack and notebook. After Gabby Petito's death last year — and amid a nationwide search for the missing vlogger — her fiancé, Brian Laundrie sent several text messages between their two cell phones to trick law enforcement into believing Petito was still alive, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced on Friday. Petito's disappearance in early September prompted a massive manhunt for the missing YouTuber after Laundrie returned home from a cross-country road trip the two had taken together without Petito. The 22-year-old's body was discovered at a Wyoming campsite on September 19. She died of ""blunt-force injuries to the head and neck, with manual strangulation,"" a coroner ruled. Laundrie, 23, disappeared about two weeks after he returned to his parents' home in Florida without his fiancée. His skeletal remains were discovered on October 20 in Florida's vast Carlton Reserve. A coroner ruled that he died by suicide from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Investigators found Laundrie's backpack, notebook, and a revolver near his remains, the FBI said. In the notebook, Laundrie claimed responsibility for Petito's death, according to investigators. In a final investigative update on Friday, the FBI said investigators identified multiple text messages between Laundrie and Petito's phones sent after Petito died. ""The timing and content of these messages are indicative of Mr. Laundrie attempting to deceive law enforcement by giving the impression that Ms. Petito was still alive,"" investigators wrote. Petito's mother, Nichole Schmidt, previously told authorities that the last text she received from her daughter's phone on August 27 was ""odd"" and left her feeling ""concerned."" The text read: ""Can you help Stan, I just keep getting his voicemails and missed calls."" According to a September search warrant, Stan is the name of Petito's grandfather, but Schmidt told authorities that her daughter never called him ""Stan."" The message left Schmidt concerned at the time that something had happened to her daughter, the warrant said. The FBI also believes that Laundrie used Petito's debit card without authorization while driving from Wyoming back to Florida. The FBI opened an investigation into Petito's disappearance on September 12, one day after her family reported her missing. ""The investigation did not identify any other individuals other than Brian Laundrie directly involved in the tragic death of Gabby Petito,"" FBI Denver Division Special Agent in Charge Michael Schneider said, adding that, ""the FBI's primary focus throughout the investigation was to bring justice to Gabby and her family."" Schneider said, ""all logical investigative steps"" in the case have now been concluded.

1/23/2022,"A New Jersey woman was browsing furniture on Walmart's website and adding items to her cart, but had not yet purchased any of them. So when package after package started arriving at her door, she was so confused. Madhu Kumar said she asked her husband and two older children if they had bought the items, but they said it wasn't them. That left Kumar's almost 2-year-old son Ayaansh Kumar as the lone culprit, NBC New York reports. Ayaansh, who is most likely still learning how to count, was playing on his mother's phone when he ordered the items totaling almost $2,000. ""It is really hard to believe that he has done this, but that’s what happened,"" his father, Pramod Kumar, told the news station. The family has been receiving packages to their Monmouth Junction home for the past week. The items include accent chairs and flower stands Madhu Kumar was eyeing. “He’s so little, he’s so cute, we were laughing that he ordered all this stuff,” she said. Walmart didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday. The family said they plan on keeping some of the packages and returning the others to Walmart so they can get a refund. Pramod Kumar said the family has learned a valuable lesson — lock their cellphones. ""Moving forward, we will put tough passcodes or face recognition so when he picks up the phone he finds it in locked condition,” he told the station.",U.S./NBC News,"Toddler clears out mom's online shopping cart, orders $2K worth of items from Walmart",https://news.yahoo.com/toddler-clears-moms-online-shopping-173033179.html
