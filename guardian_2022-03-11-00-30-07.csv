3/11/2022,"This is not really a song recital, for all that there’s a singer and a pianist on its cover. “Small pieces of opera in a few minutes” is how the soprano Asmik Grigorian describes each of the Rachmaninov romances on this, her debut recital recording, and in these performances with Lukas Geniušas that’s exactly how they come across: 19 self-contained scenes that drip with drama. Perhaps you would expect no less from such a stage animal as Grigorian, but it’s still gratifying to find that her powers of expression are as fierce in front of the microphone as they are on the stage. Her tone at its fullest, all velvet-wrapped steel, gleams with enough edge to cut through anything a full-throttle Rachmaninov piano part can throw at it, and Geniušas does not give the impression of holding back; in Spring Waters, setting words by the Romantic poet Fyodor Tyutchev, there’s a thrilling few moments as the surging piano torrents briefly threaten to overwhelm the voice. Quieter passages bring hints of vulnerability and a more convincing tenderness than most singers of Grigorian’s power can summon without the voice losing its poise. Rachmaninov is a composer in whose work Geniušas has shone especially brilliantly as a soloist; here, as a duet partner, he’s just soloistic enough, with an attentive ear for the detail of what Grigorian wants to achieve with the shape of a phrase. The opening song, from which the disc takes its title, is a prime example: Geniušas urges Grigorian on as the music surges upwards, then calibrates his support note for note as the urgency ebbs and the melody descends. That is the longest song here and, written in 1912, the latest. The programme, in a sequence chosen by the performers, ranges from some of the Op 4 songs Rachmaninov wrote as a student to his Op 34. Some last barely 90 seconds, but here they still seem like a scene rather than merely a song – a panoramic view, not a snapshot. Grigorian and Genušias will make you wonder why you don’t hear them more often. Is from another brilliantly balanced partnership. Alina Ibragimova’s crisp violin playing strikes sparks off Cédric Tiberghien’s serene piano as they turn their attention to Mendelssohn’s violin sonatas – the one he published and those he left in manuscript. The latter an ambitious mature work and a winning first try from the composer when an 11-year-old prodigy.",Arts/Music,Dissonance: Rachmaninov Songs review – fierce expressionism dripping with drama,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/10/dissonance-rachmaninov-songs-review-asmik-grigorian-lukas-geniusas
3/11/2022,"British soldiers who travel to Ukraine to fight can expect to be court-martialled, Boris Johnson has said, adding that civilians should also avoid going there to fight. Asked about reports that a 19-year-old from Warrington with no military experience had travelled to the country to join efforts against the Russian invasion, the prime minister said that while he could comprehend why people wanted to help, they should remain in the UK. “I think that everybody seeing what’s happening in Ukraine will understand those feelings,” he told reporters during a visit to the Cammell Laird shipyard in Merseyside. “I think many people, many people in our armed forces, will sympathise because I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a clear distinction in international affairs between right and wrong and good and evil in what President Putin is doing to people in Ukraine. “But we have very clear laws in this country. You shouldn’t go to Ukraine, and I’m afraid people going from our armed services, as the chief of the defence staff made clear the other day, will face court martial.” His comments are in notable contrast to those by Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, who said at the end of last month that she would back Britons going to Ukraine to join the fight against the Russians. Truss faced criticism for her comments, which ran counter to advice on her department’s own website, which says that those who travel “to fight, or to assist others engaged in the conflict” could be prosecuted on their return to the UK. A small number of serving British personnel are believed to have gone absent without leave to join the resistance against the Russian invasion, while veterans and Britons without combat experience have also travelled to Ukraine. Ministry of Defence chiefs have banned all service personnel from travelling to Ukraine “until further notice” and warned they will face prosecution if they do. Speaking earlier on Thursday, the armed forces minister, James Heappey, said: “It is illegal for British service personnel to, first of all, go absent without leave in the first place, but to go absent without leave in order to fight in a foreign war is simply unacceptable, and frankly risks the United Kingdom being wrongly claimed by Russia to be a belligerent in this.” At the weekend the UK’s chief of the defence staff, Adm Sir Tony Radakin, said people should not “rush to … the sound of gunfire”, and should offer support in other ways.",News/UK news,"British troops who leave to fight in Ukraine will face court martial, says PM",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/10/british-troops-awol-ukraine-russia-invasion-court-martial-boris-johnson
3/11/2022,"Marks & Spencer’s chief executive Steve Rowe is stepping down in May after nearly 40 years at the business he joined straight from school. Rowe, who has spent six years overseeing the beginnings of a turnaround in the retailer’s fortunes after years in the doldrums, is to be replaced by the boss of its food business, Stuart Machin. Katie Bickerstaffe, who oversees M&S’s clothing and home division and was also a contender for the top job, will now sit on the board as co-chief executive, tasked with a focus on uniting the retailer’s online and high street operations. Eoin Tonge, the finance director, will now oversee strategy in an increased role. The new team takes charge after a positive turn for the 138-year-old chain, which had its best-ever Christmas on food and claimed its highest market share in full-price clothing since 2013 as shoppers emerging from last year’s lockdowns sought it out. M&S did not reveal whether Rowe, who joined M&S at 15, would receive a payoff but said he would step down as chief executive after the company’s annual results announcement on 25 May and cease full-time employment after the annual shareholder meeting on 5 July. He will then remain as an adviser for up to 12 months. Archie Norman, the chair of M&S, said: “The appointments we are making today bring together a very strong leadership team to take the business into the next stage of its transformation.” He added: “Steve has been a magnificent servant of M&S, putting his heart and soul into the job. Coming from the shop floor to lead the business, he epitomises our values and has lived and breathed M&S for so many years. “He is living proof of the opportunities M&S provides for great people to succeed. The M&S he took over was in parlous shape and throughout my tenure he has been fearless in grasping the nettles and facing into the challenges and has delivered massive progress. “As we move into the next growth phase, he leaves a very strong team to take the business forward.

3/11/2022,"One of the most renowned diamond dealers in the Netherlands has been convicted of fraud and money laundering after staging an armed robbery of €4.1m (£3.4m) diamonds from one of his stores as part of an insurance scam. Mischa van Gelder, 55, told a court in Amsterdam that he now found his plot “incomprehensible” but that he had been motivated by financial difficulties when he hatched it with three other men in 2016. “I wasn’t like that, I’m not like that. I did something terrible,” he told the court. “I was in a panic.” Van Gelder, whose family company, Van Gelder Diamonds, has sold to private individuals and traded in wholesale diamonds since 1904, pretended to police that he had been forced at gunpoint to open his vault during a raid. But in reality Van Gelder had organised the whole thing. He had let the men into his vault, where he was voluntarily tied up and locked in. He was released after calling his daughter. Van Gelder had agreed that his three accomplices could keep the diamonds from the vault while he would seek to claim back their value through his insurers. Before Van Gelder was arrested, his insurer paid out €3.5m (£2.9m). After his arrest, one of the three men he had hired to stage the raid, named in court as Danny S, sought to blackmail him with recordings of their arrangement. Van Gelder, who has already served 76 days in prison, was given a partially suspended prison sentence of six months and a maximum community service order of 240 hours. “The suspect went very far and scared a lot of people,” the judge said. “He made the people around him believe that an armed robbery had taken place. As a result, the police had to conduct an unnecessary large-scale investigation.” Danny S was sentenced to a 90-day suspended prison term and 200 hours of community service for fraud. The two other men involved are yet to be caught. Van Gelder has paid back the money scammed from his insurer. The diamonds are still missing. At the time of Van Gelder’s arrest, his father, Jack, then 76, issued an apology and said he would take over the business. He said: “We are all shocked and deeply moved by these developments. I have personally taken charge of our family business again and have taken the necessary measures to ensure continuity. On behalf of the company I would like to apologise to the police, the public prosecution service, the insurer, customers, suppliers – everyone who has been misled by Mischa’s actions.”",News/World news,Dutch diamond dealer found guilty over staged €4.1m armed robbery,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/dutch-diamond-dealer-mischa-van-gelder-guilty-staged-armed-robbery
3/11/2022,"India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata party has claimed victory in four significant state elections, in a sign of the sweeping power of Hindu nationalist politics across the country. In a crucial win, the BJP defied historical precedent and retained power in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous and politically significant state with over 180 million voters. Early results on Thursday showed the party had won at least 266 out of 403 seats, giving it a clear majority. It was the first win for an incumbent party in the state in more than three decades, and ensures that the chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu monk known for his hardline views, will be the first in the state’s history to remain in power for a second consecutive term. It secures Adityanath’s status as one of the most powerful figures in the BJP and potential successor to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as well as offering a ringing endorsement for the hardline Hindu nationalist agenda that Adityanath has enacted over the past five years. During his tenure, Adityanath, who dresses in saffron robes and led his own “Hindu army”, had often used communal rhetoric seen as targeting Muslims during his time as chief minister. He had banned the slaughter of cows, an animal which is holy to Hindus, and brought in an anti-conversion law against “love jihad”, a disproven conspiracy theory that Muslims are forcing Hindu women into marriage in order to convert them to Islam. Journalists and activists were also routinely harassed and charged, and the Uttar Pradesh police stand accused of routinely murdering Muslims and Dalits under Adityanath’s watch. Utter Pradesh was one of the states hit hardest by the brutal second Covid-19 wave that engulfed India, with corpses filling up the Ganges river as hospitals and burial grounds become overwhelmed, and the state has one of the highest unemployment rates in India. But Adityanath’s win has been credited to his development agenda and perceived crackdown on crime, as well as the popularity of Hindu nationalist politics in India, which are shifting the country away from its secular roots towards becoming a Hindu nation. Holding on to the bellwether state had been seen as essential for the BJP as it builds up towards the national elections in 2024. Early results showed that the BJP, which has ruled India’s central government since 2014, led by Modi, also held on to power in the states of Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur. In the Uttar Pradesh capital, Lucknow, BJP workers rode bulldozers to the party offices in celebration of their crushing win. In a victory speech in the city, Adityanath told crowds: “Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, today the BJP won a majority in Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur. The voters have blessed Modi’s policies of development and good governance.” The assembly results have been portrayed as a final nail in the coffin for India’s once formidable National Congress Party, the country’s oldest political party and main national opposition for the BJP. On Thursday, it became evident that Congress had lost seats in Goa and Manipur and failed to win back its former stronghold of Punjab, one of the few states where it had still held power. In Uttar Pradesh, it won just a single seat. “The revolution marches on” was the headline following the result on an editorial in the Indian express newspaper, which called the results “sobering” and added: “It sends a plain and simple message … the BJP simply has no competition.” Instead, in a victory that could be transformative for India’s future political landscape, it was the Aam Admi Party (AAP), a relatively new party which is in power in Delhi but previously had limited presence outside the capital, that claimed a landslide win in Punjab, with the comedian turned politician Bhagwant Mann to become chief minister. The Punjab win could set AAP up as a national contender in the 2024 general elections, as various regional parties jostle to fill the opposition vacuum left by a weakened Congress. Congress leaders issued sombre statements following the results. “This is a challenging moment for the Congress party and Punjab most certainly has been a disappointment,” said a party spokesperson, Aadil Singh Boparai. Rahul Gandhi, the de facto Congress leader, said in a tweet that the party “humbly accept people’s verdict. We’ll learn from this.” Former government minister Ashwani Kumar, who recently quit the Congress party, said it was a “moment of reckoning”. “One thing is clear,” he said. “The Gandhi leadership no longer delivers for the Congress.”",News/World news,BJP claims election victory in four states including Uttar Pradesh,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/bjp-claims-victory-four-state-elections-uttar-pradesh-yogi-adityanath
3/11/2022,"The face-to-face meeting between Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, was largely a depressing rehearsal of two conflicting narratives, but perhaps most revealing for what it showed about Russia’s siege mentality and consummate ability to relabel objective truths as western lies. The meeting was also notable for the Ukrainians starting to develop an argument that they are prepared for an alternative to Nato membership, so long as the country is given security and economic guarantees underwritten by the west and Russia. Kuleba stressed in an interview with the Turkish public broadcaster TRT that Ukraine was not willing to give up the possibility of Nato membership yet, but could see these guarantees as either an alternative or a staging post to Nato. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, admitted he had gone colder on Nato in recent weeks given its refusal to use its collective strength to help his country. Lavrov said these remarks “showed there were some signs that the Ukrainian President Zelenskiy is starting to understand our approach”, but it is hard to envisage what credible security guarantees Moscow could give any western government – early on at his press conference, Lavrov said “Russia has no plans to attack other countries, we have not even attacked Ukraine”. He later justified the attack on Mariupol’s maternity hospital by saying Russia had warned at the UN days earlier that the hospital had been taken over by Azov battalion, a right-wing, neo-Nazi militia battalion initially formed after the invasion of Crimea in 2014. “All the mothers that were about to give birth were chased out of there,” he claimed. “It is not the first time we see pathetic outcries concerning so-called atrocities perpetrated by the Russian military. Unfortunately the other side is never looked at.” He then became irritated when western journalists, who he regards as state propagandists, tried to point out there were pictures of children killed at the hospital. “Oh, this is the third time I’ve had to speak on the maternity and children hospital,” he said. “And you’re just not listening. And nobody will say that three days ago at the security council of the United Nations we explained what happened with that ward.” Lavrov showed a surprising desire to speed up the decoupling of the Russian economy from the west. He said Vladimir Putin was taking care of the Russian economy, and that measures would be taken to ensure “no Uncle Sams” destroyed it. “This should have been done long ago, ” he said, in an implicit admission of the failure to prepare for the inevitable western economic sanctions of the past fortnight. “This time I assure you we will come out of this crisis with a healthier mentality and consciousness since we will not have illusions that the west can be a reliable partner,” he said. Private property and the presumption of innocence had both been violated, he said. “We will not cultivate the illusions that the west, when it talks about its values, or belief in this. We will overcome adversity, and we will do everything to no longer depend on the west in any strategic sectors of our life that are of decisive importance for our people.” As to the prospects of further talks, Lavrov did not rule out a meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy at some point – but only if it was not talks for their own sake. He said the talks happening in Belarus were the primary diplomatic track. Kuleba, for his part, said it felt like Lavrov had not come to negotiate on the issues he had raised, such as a 24-hour ceasefire, saying the true decision-makers were elsewhere. In reality, he said, he had only gone to Turkey in deference to the request made by his friend Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, the Turkish foreign minister. Çavuşoğlu described the summit, his brainchild, as “an important beginning”, referencing the discussions about future security guarantees for Ukraine, and perhaps something exists to develop. But it was noticeable that Lavrov was happiest acting as a propagandist rather than a negotiator, discussing various Russian conspiracy theories, such as Ukraine’s plans to build a new Nazi state, the banning of the Russian language and Orthodox Church, the secret presence of US military biological weapon sites inside Ukraine, and the equally secret plans Russia had unearthed showing Ukraine had planned to invade Russia. Whether Lavrov, decades into this job, any longer really believes any of this hermetically sealed Russian account of the world is hard to tell, but it makes for an unforgiving interlocutor.",News/World news,Sergei Lavrov prefers propaganda over reality in Ukraine talks,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/sergei-lavrov-russia-foreign-minister-propaganda-in-ukraine-talks
3/11/2022,"Waiting times for cancer care in England are the longest on record, the latest figures have revealed, forcing tens of thousands of patients every month to wait longer than they should to see a specialist or start treatment. The NHS’s performance against seven of its nine cancer waiting times targets has fallen to its worst ever level, prompting concern about patients having their diagnosis or treatment delayed. The worsening of fast access to cancer care was revealed in NHS England’s latest monthly batch of data showing how quickly hospitals are providing key services, including surgery and A&E care against targets that are supposedly patient rights enshrined in the NHS constitution. The figures also showed that the number of people waiting for operations such as hip and knee replacements and cataract removals has risen again to just over 6.1 million – yet another new record high. Almost 24,000 have been waiting for more than two years. For example, while 93% of people who GPs suspect may have cancer should be seen by a specialist within two weeks of their urgent referral, in January just 75% were – the lowest proportion ever. While 152,093 of the 202,816 people GPs referred to hospital were seen within two weeks, another 50,723 – one in four – were not. Similarly, although 96% of people with confirmed cancer should start treatment within 31 days of doctors deciding to treat them, just 89.6% did so. That means that 2,644 of the 25,524 patients had to wait longer than a month to start receiving chemotherapy, have radiotherapy or undergo surgery. And an even smaller proportion of people with cancer who should start treatment within 62 days of being referred by a GP did so in January. While the target is 85%, hospitals only managed to treat 61.8% of them in that time, which meant that 5,161 people had their care delayed. “It is deeply troubling to see these figures now at yet another worst-ever record, as we know that any delay to diagnosis and treatment causes huge amounts of anxiety and distress for people living with cancer”, said Eve Byrne, the director of advocacy at Macmillan Cancer Support. While the figures cover a period in which the Omicron variant of Covid-19 was putting hospitals under pressure, performance across the nine different waiting times was worse than a year earlier when they were grappling with the Delta variant, which left more people seriously ill than Omicron. Both Macmillan and Cancer Research UK pinpointed longstanding shortages of staff in the NHS cancer workforce as a key reason for the sharp decline in performance. “More people than ever before are facing unacceptably long waits for vital cancer tests and treatment,” said Michelle Mitchell, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK. “Winter pressures and Omicron combined have only added weight to a historically overburdened NHS, but staff shortages were holding down efforts to improve cancer survival well before this.” Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, who was treated last year for kidney cancer, said: “I know from experience the importance of an early cancer diagnosis and quick treatment. Too many cancer patients are left waiting for unacceptable lengths of time, with the insecurity of not knowing. “The Conservatives use the pandemic as an excuse, but that doesn’t explain why cancer patients have been waiting longer every year since 2010.” Over the last 12 months a total of 424,382 people with suspected cancer have not seen a specialist within two weeks, 19,861 of those diagnosed with the disease did not start treatment within 31 days and 50,049 had to wait longer than the supposed maximum 62 days. The performance data also showed that: Just 73.3% of people who attended A&E in January were treated within four hours – the joint lowest ever figure – even though the target is 95%. Ambulances are taking longer to respond to 999 calls, both for emergency and also urgent calls. More than a third of young people needing treatment for potentially life-threatening eating disorders are waiting more than 12 weeks. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, stressed that “despite ongoing pressures our hardworking NHS staff delivered 280,000 more tests and checks for patients in January compared to the same time last year, and almost 1.24 million started consultant-led treatment, as more people continue to come forward for care who may have been reluctant to seek help during the pandemic.” ",News/Society,NHS waiting times for cancer care in England now longest on record,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/10/nhs-waiting-times-for-cancer-care-in-england-now-longest-on-record
3/11/2022,"Hello, and Happy Thursday, It’s no secret that the US supreme court has been hostile to voting rights recently. But two recent decisions, I think, highlight why what the court is doing is both alarming and inconsistent. On Monday evening, the court gave Democrats two major victories, blocking Republican attempts to impose unfair congressional maps in North Carolina and Pennsylvania. In both states the respective state supreme courts had redrawn them to be fairer – decisions which the US supreme court upheld. Yet even though legal experts expected this outcome, a dissenting opinion from three of the court’s conservative justices set off loud alarm bells for me. The dissent was authored by Justice Samuel Alito (and joined by Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch in the North Carolina case). The three justices wrote that they would have blocked the state supreme court maps from going into effect. They pointed to a provision in the US constitution, the elections clause, that explicitly gives state legislatures the authority to set the “time, manner, and place” of federal elections. That provision, they said, likely means that state supreme courts can’t impose a new map, even if the one the legislature adopts violates a state’s constitution. “If the language of the Elections Clause is taken seriously, there must be some limit on the authority of state courts to countermand actions taken by state legislatures when they are prescribing rules for the conduct of federal elections,” Alito wrote. Alito’s dissent embraces an idea called the “independent state legislature doctrine”. Increasingly popular among conservative litigants, it argues that state courts cannot second-guess election rules – whether it be a gerrymandered map or a new voter ID law – passed by a legislature. It would give state legislatures enormous power over elections. The theory largely fell into disuse in the early 20th century, according to a paper by Michael Morley, a law professor at Florida State University. The supreme court has also repeatedly rejected the idea over the last century. But in a handful of cases during the 2020 election, Alito, Kavanaugh, Gorsuch and Thomas all expressed interest in the idea. The focus on this idea is also notable because it is directly at odds with what Alito and other conservative justices have said recently. Reading Alito’s dissent, I couldn’t help but think of a majority opinion that he, Thomas, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh signed onto in 2019. In that case, called Rucho v Common Cause, they were part of a majority that said federal courts could not do anything to stop partisan gerrymandering. But, Roberts wrote, state laws and state courts could continue to police it. It was a clear instruction to litigants that they should take their cases about partisan gerrymandering to state courts, which is exactly what they did in North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Now, Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch – and maybe Kavanaugh – seem to be backing away from that position. It’s not the only area of voting rights law where the supreme court has pulled a kind of bait-and-switch recently. In 2013, when a majority of the court, including Roberts, Alito and Thomas, gutted the the heart of the Voting Rights Act, designed to prevent voting discrimination, it pointed to another provision of the law, section 2, as a tool litigants could continue to use. But recently, the court has been slowly chipping away at section 2, too, making it harder to challenge laws under it and stepping in to overrule lower courts that have relied on it to block discriminatory maps. Taken together, the cases show how the supreme court is slowly attacking laws that are supposed to prevent Americans against voting discrimination. One other piece of Alito’s dissent deserves attention because it is, I would argue, hypocritical. In two short paragraphs, Alito explained why he didn’t think it would be a big deal for a court to step in and order North Carolina to adopt new congressional districts after candidates had begun filing for office ahead of the state’s 17 May primary. The public interest favored such a reset, he said, to ensure that districts were constitutional. All candidates would have to do, he said, was file a new form indicating they were running in the districts the legislature, not the state supreme court, had adopted. “That would not have been greatly disruptive,” he wrote. But last month, Alito took the opposite approach when he agreed with an opinion by Kavanaugh saying it would be too disruptive to impose new, non-discriminatory maps for Alabama’s 24 May primary – a week later than the one in North Carolina. Kavanaugh wrote: “Running elections statewide is extraordinarily complicated and difficult. Those elections require enormous advance preparations by state and local officials, and pose significant logistical challenges.” That argument prompted a furious response from Justice Elena Kagan, who said discrimination in Alabama should not get a free pass merely because elections were on the horizon. “Alabama is not entitled to keep violating Black Alabamians’ voting rights just because the court’s order came down in the first month of an election year,” she said. The opposing conclusions Alito reached in both cases underscores the immense discretion he is wielding on the bench to evaluate these claims. In North Carolina, when the legislature’s constitutional rights were at issue, it warranted the supreme court’s intervention. In Alabama, when Black Americans’ voting rights were at issue, he believed the court’s intervention was not needed. Also worth watching… A Colorado election clerk was indicted on charges she helped allow unaurthorized access to voting equipment. Florida Republicans are on the verge of creating a new office to investigate election crimes. The top election official in Texas’s largest county announced she would resign after the county experienced significant voting problems in the state’s primary. Newly released records in Wisconsin provide insight into a widely criticized review of the 2020 election.",News/US news,Why dissent by conservative justices in voting rights cases is alarming,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/10/us-supreme-court-dissent-voting-rights
3/11/2022,"The former England and Arsenal forward Kelly Smith expressed her delight at the number of girls taking part in the biggest football session in schools across the country on Wednesday, with numbers topping 90,000. “It’s huge, 90,000, that just blows my mind,” said the 43-year-old, who was England’s record goalscorer until Ellen White passed her tally of 46 in November 2021. “I’ve seen an appetite and a hunger from these girls to want to play football. That is really, really pleasing for me because when I first started playing I was the only one in the whole school. Now, you see a whole team coming out, prepared and ready, wanting to learn and want to have fun with it. It’s great to see the numbers going up in every school that I go into.” Currently, only 63% of schools offer girls’ football in PE and only 40% offer extra-curricular football to girls. The Let Girls Play campaign, launched by the FA and Barclays, hosted sessions in 1,450 primary and secondary schools as part of an attempt to get 75% of schools offering football for girls in PE lessons and 90% offering extracurricular access to the game by 2024. “I was a little bit upset with the current figures,” said Smith, who joined the session at Oakington Primary School, which had 200 girls taking part. “I want all schools across the country offering access to football, if the boys have it why shouldn’t the girls have it? Eventually we don’t want to be having days like this, we want just equal access across all schools for girls.” Smith, who retired from playing in 2017, is still a well-known figure, remembered for her prowess on the pitch and for using that legacy to continue to support the growth of the game. “As a young girl I dreamt of being a professional footballer, but I had to leave England to do that,” said Smith. “I’m so happy that now we have a full professional league in this country. I just went out and expressed myself, I had fun, I wanted to be the best player that I could be and if people watched me and value me, I love that. “I like integrating with all the girls, being an inspiration and saying: ‘You know what, if you work hard, if you get your head down, if you listen to your coaches, then anything is possible, the world is your oyster. You’ve got a football session at school in PE or in an after-school club, you’ve got clubs that I can play for and you can be scouted by England.’ There’s a pathway now.

3/11/2022,"Of all the trophy assets owned by Russia-linked billionaires in the UK, one has always stood out: Chelsea football club. On Thursday, ownership of the London club was officially frozen after the designation of Roman Abramovich for UK sanctions. Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, lawyers for Abramovich had strenuously insisted that he did not fit the criteria for sanctions, but the UK has now become the first of the Nato allies to impose sanctions on him. Of all the people alleged by the UK government to have links to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, Abramovich had perhaps the closest affiliation with the UK. However, an MP last week claimed in the Commons that he was starting a fire sale of UK properties, as well as seeking to offload Chelsea for as much as £4bn. As well as Chelsea, Abramovich owns a stake in the steel company Evraz and Norilsk Nickel, also known as Nornickel, both of which had shares listed on the London Stock Exchange that are now suspended. The UK government cited Forbes’ estimate of his net worth at £9.4bn, and said he was “one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin”. His UK property reportedly includes a 15-bedroom mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens in central London that was bought for £90m in 2009, and a Chelsea penthouse overlooking the River Thames bought in 2018 for a reported £22m. Yet he also has assets that are beyond the reach of British officials. Château de la Croë, a sprawling villa on France’s Mediterranean coast once owned by British royals, is thought to be worth €100m. Abramovich owns one of the world’s biggest superyachts, the 140m Solaris, which can reportedly host 36 guests. Its value has been estimated at $600m by the website SuperYachtFan. The yacht left Barcelona on Tuesday, and was sailing off the south coast of Sicily on Thursday morning, according to the ship-tracking website Marine Traffic. A spokesperson for Abramovich previously told Reuters: “We never comment on the movements of the yacht or any other vehicles or vessels.” The billionaire has also been linked to an older but even larger yacht, the 162m Eclipse. For faster travel, Abramovich is also thought to own a private jet. Forbes Russia last year reported that Abramovich had spent $350m on a new Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. The 787 is more usually used by airlines as a twin-aisle passenger jet to carry up to 300 people, but Forbes said that Abramovich’s version was reduced to about 30 passengers travelling in luxury, along with 20 staff. The plane linked to Abramovich flew from Moscow to Dubai and back again on 4 March, according to FlightRadar24, a tracking website. The sanctions mean Abramovich will be unable to sell any shares in Evraz, a steel company incorporated in London but with mostly Russian assets. Its share price slumped by as much as 13% on Thursday morning after the announcement of sanctions, before financial regulators ordered trading to be suspended to await clarification on sanctions. Abramovich’s stake was worth £1.4bn at the end of 2021, but had slumped to £320m on Wednesday evening. The London Stock Exchange suspended trading in Norilsk Nickel on Thursday last week, along with 26 other companies with strong links to Russia. A further eight firms were suspended the next day for having similar ties. Abramovich was approached for comment. Evraz was also approached for comment.",News/World news,London mansions to superyachts: what are Roman Abramovich’s assets?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/london-mansions-superyacht-chelsea-fc-roman-abramovich-assets
3/11/2022,"Pharrell Williams’s career has thrown up several curveballs – a homage to XTC’s Andy Partridge on the Despicable Me 3 soundtrack, a Metallica remix that sounds like 90s hardcore rave – but this might be the most intriguing: Pharrell, Kanye West and Lupe Fiasco rhyming over The Eraser by Thom Yorke. Alas, the supergroup idea didn’t last long: a fascinating what if? A lost classic from Kelis’s second album, which wasn’t released in the US: guest rap from Pusha T, slapping beats, reedy organ, great hook (“Make my record skip, make my record skip”) fantastic chorus. It was repurposed – with Nas replacing Pusha T – for the Neptunes’ Clones album, but the original still wins. Pharrell’s only contribution to the uncompromisingly dark Juggernaut was a guest spot, rapping over the distorted beats and dive-bombing bass, but it was enough to spark rumours of a collaborative Tyler/Williams album. The rumours were untrue, but you can’t really blame people for wanting one: Juggernaut is that good. The main lyrical preoccupations of NERD’s debut album are evident in the song titles – Lapdance, Rock Star, Am I High? – but Run to the Sun is something else: slick funk that sounds like a love song, but turns out to be a regret-filled paean to Williams’s ailing grandmother. Heartbreaking and danceable. A bold attempt to apply the WTF? factor of the Neptunes’ golden age productions to a huge pop star in the era of algorithms: jittery, glitchy beats, a distorted snatch of dialogue from a rightwing protest against Obamacare, a killer rap from Nicki Minaj. Williams has been dismissive of his flop debut solo album In My Mind (“I wrote those songs out of ego … there was no purpose”) and while it’s certainly no classic, it does contain one gem in Angel: infused with the spirit of old soul records, led by a rolling piano, blessed with a gorgeous melody. The eighth highest-selling single in UK history, Happy is hopelessly, perhaps irrevocably, overplayed: plenty of listeners would doubtless be delighted never to hear it again. But behind the familiarity lurks a fantastic pop song, its lyrical straightforwardness balanced by beautifully nuanced production that evokes 60s soul without sounding like an imitation. Even on an album that featured productions from Dr Dre, André 3000, Dallas Austin and Jam and Lewis, the Neptunes’ work stood out: battering-ram drums, dive-bombing sub-bass, raw-sounding brass samples, an incongruously sweet acoustic guitar. In the Neptunes’ pre-fame days, Williams wrote psychedelic sci-fi rhymes: a Virginia Beach friend remembered lyrics about “space coasters” and laser guns. There’s an echo of that early weirdness here: “I got a colourful aura,” he offers, “like I got neon guts.” And the beat is terrific: spacey synths over a super-stoned rhythm track. You could easily opt for Busta Rhymes’ other great Neptunes production, Pass the Courvoisier Part 2, but Light Your Ass on Fire’s cocky minimalism is what makes it: beyond the opening nod to Kraftwerk’s Trans-Europe Express, there’s nothing but a drumbeat, clearly designed to sound incredible at immense volume. Williams had 90s chart success as a protege of Teddy Riley, but Superthug was the track that announced the arrival of the Neptunes as an utterly distinctive, disruptive voice in hip-hop, pushing a ferocious beat and a nagging, cyclical keyboard line to the forefront of the mix. Head-turning 24 years ago, it still sounds amazing. Why NERD chose to re-record their debut album with a rock band is an enduring mystery. The original Europe-only electronic version is vastly superior, as demonstrated by Lapdance: the first take is stripped-down, ultra-catchy electronic funk that highlights Williams’s cool falsetto; the re-recording is a lumpy mess that sounds uncomfortably like nu-metal. Chuck Brown’s early go-go hit Bustin’ Loose is an old school hip-hop sampling staple used by everyone from Eric B And Rakim to LL Cool J, but no one ever deployed it quite as successfully as on Nelly’s multi-platinum, Grammy-winning summer of 2002 anthem, a highlight of the Neptunes’ Midas-touch years. “I came here with my dick in my hand!” bellows Mystikal, which rather makes it sound as if he’s trying to start a party in an STD clinic. But in fairness, Shake Ya Ass – its backing track derived from James Brown’s Soul Power, Pharrell’s smooth chorus – could probably start a party anywhere. Both a fantastic single and a missed opportunity: what if Michael Jackson hadn’t been so ill-advised as to turn down the Neptunes songs that wound up on Justin Timberlake’s debut album in favour of the appalling gloop he dished up on 2001’s Invincible? His loss was the former boyband member’s credibility-boosting gain. NERD’s second album Fly or Die was a mess: an album that couldn’t work out what it wanted to be. But it also contained the greatest example of their attempt to fuse rock and 21st century funk: wracked with frustrated lust, driven by frantic acoustic guitar, She Wants to Move is propulsive, preposterous and perfect. Along with Happy and the best-forgotten Blurred Lines, Get Lucky made Pharrell into pop’s dominant force in 2013. It also ensured Get Lucky’s wearying, ongoing ominipresence, but it got played to death for a reason, or rather two: its elegant update of disco and Pharrell’s seemingly effortless melody and vocal, both allegedly made up on the spot. It is less celebrated than the Neptunes’ gamechanging 00s beats, but the backing Williams devised for Burgundy is immense: the stumbling, lurching rhythm sounds unsteady on its feet; a chopped-up orchestral sample (from 80s Britfunkers Beggar and Co) blares out; voices shout, synths chaotically undulate. Queasy, head-spinning brilliance. Even when the world’s biggest stars came calling for their beats, the Neptunes always seemed to hold back something special for local Virginia Beach duo the Clipse. You could pick virtually anything off their stunning second album, Hell Hath No Fury, but Mr Me Too’s weird cocktail of slinkiness and menace is particularly awesome. The globe-swallowing success of opener Crazy in Love inevitably overshadowed the rest of Beyoncé’s debut album – unfairly so in the case of her brilliant debut solo single Work It Out, a knotty tapestry of funk samples paired with a vocal that could have been recorded in Alabama’s Fame Studios in the late 60s. Even by the Neptunes’ platinum-plated early 00s standards, Drop It Like It’s Hot was huge: the most popular rap song of the decade according to Billboard. It was also a thrillingly audacious way to achieve huge crossover success, its backing almost entirely made up of white noise and the sound of tongues clicking. ODB’s life was spiralling out of control by the time of his second album, recorded piecemeal between jail sentences. But its single was an unalloyed triumph, framing his increasingly unhinged rapping (actually one of the album’s more coherent ODB vocals) with a skeletal funk bassline, lo-fi synth lines and a chorus that introduced Kelis to the world. There is something incredibly cheering about the Neptunes’ refusal to tone down their production style even when employed by a star as huge as Britney Spears: the brilliance of the Prince-influenced I’m a Slave 4 U lies in the tension between its pop melody and the off-key electronics in the background. Where that other classic Snoop/Williams collaboration, Drop It Like It’s Hot, is minimal and darkly funky, Beautiful is its polar opposite: busy and, in its own, very Snoop-esque way, lovestruck: the simple, Williams-sung chorus is just perfect, despite his later protestations that his vocal is “flat as fuck”. The highlight of Ocean’s second album Channel Orange set his jaded drawing of Ladera Heights’ moneyed denizens to a deceptively complex Williams backing, filled with subtle details: beneath the retro-soul electric piano and bass and thick harmonies lurk echoing voices, strange vocal loops and a fantastic horn arrangement. Amid the dazzling pyrotechnic displays of the Neptunes’ productions, the funk guitar-driven Frontin’ minted a line in Williams solo tracks that rested less on jaw-dropping sonics than straightforwardly great songwriting rooted in R&B’s past, particularly the work of Curtis Mayfield, who he sounds remarkably like here. Williams is famous for his “four-count starts” – there’s a 13-hour Spotify playlist dedicated to tracks featuring his trademark intros – but on I Just Wanna Love You, the Neptunes stuck the same stammering effect into every fourth bar of the guitar sample to ultra-catchy effect. Also features one of Williams’s best falsetto hooks: “I’m a hustler bay-by!” Before it became an important track – adopted as a Black Lives Matter protest anthem – Alright was already an incredible one. Williams set Lamar’s optimism in the face of crushing adversity to a disorientating patchwork of jazz brass, luxurious harmony vocals and snapping drums: he also took care of the chorus, subsequently adapted into a chant of defiance. “The world is about to feel something they never felt before,” crows Williams on Grindin’, and he has a point. So minimal that the sudden appearance of a hi-hat pattern feels like an event, Grindin’ features a rhythm track that sounds like car doors slamming, an eerie drip of electronics as a hook – and that’s it. It’s bold, cocky and supremely powerful. It’s a close-run thing, but Milkshake represents the high-water mark of the Neptunes’ ability to turn risky, exploratory music into chart gold. It tears up the pop production rulebook: the rhythm is provided entirely by a single Egyptian darbuka drum, the synths fizz and blare at odds with Kelis’ vocal, the whole thing is borderline atonal, and it’s flat-out one of the weirdest-sounding records ever to make the Top 5. But it works perfectly as a single: it’s both impossibly hooky and an irresistible invitation to dance; it conjures up a humid, sexy atmosphere without succumbing to a solitary cliche.
