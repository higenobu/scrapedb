4/19/2022,"Coverage of Ukraine from Russia's Channel One is often at odds with reporting from the ground. Last month, a segment producer interrupted a live broadcast to call out the station for airing propaganda. Back at the start of this year, if you turned on Russia's Channel One, you might find a Russian-language version of Sesame Street, Russian reality shows and Brazilian telenovelas, or even shows imported from the US, like Boardwalk Empire. Now, the channel broadcasts blanket coverage of what broadcasters call Russia's ""Special Military Operation"" in Ukraine. While Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which began Feb 24, has garnered huge attention across the globe, Channel One's updates have offered a flattering take on the news that's often at odds with reporting from the ground. Russian media relentlessly covers the war, but only in sanitized and distorted ways that adhere to the Kremlin's official positions. Watching Channel One, the country's most popular state-run station, is like looking at an alternate reality. On March 25, Russian TV quoted the official Kremlin number of dead Russian soldiers at 1,351, with 3,825 wounded. Around the same time, NATO put the number of Russian military deaths in Ukraine at between 7,000 and 15,000. Instead of coffins and funerals, Channel One shows a row of eight soldiers in hospital gowns in Moscow receiving medals for bravery. Most are missing limbs below the knee. Channel One airs a segment saying Satanists working for a private military contractor made up of former American special forces soldiers are operating in Ukraine and worshipping the devil. Text crawling across the bottom of the screen shows that the Russian Defense Ministry says tactical aircraft have destroyed 83 military targets in Ukraine. Videos on social media platforms from Twitter to Telegram show airport landing strips filled with Russian military vehicles on fire. Clips of tanks and helicopters blown to smithereens in Ukrainian streets and farmers fields are everywhere. Ukraine's intelligence agency posts what it claims are tapped phone calls of Russian forces talking to relatives about the number of soldiers dying around them. None of this is mentioned in Russia's mainstream media. The only break in Channel One's carefully scheduled programming was when state television editor and segment producer Maria Ovsyannikova interrupted a live broadcast in mid-March to denounce the war and call out the station for airing propaganda. Ovsyannikova held up a handwritten poster with the words ""they are lying to you here"" written in Russian and managed to stay on screen for around 5 seconds, while host Ekaterina Andreeva continued reading from a teleprompter with only a slight adjustment in her delivery. Andreeva, a fixture on Russian broadcasts since 1997 who has read the news on Channel One's evening broadcast since Putin took control of the Kremlin in 2000, posted a livestream to her personal social media accounts a day later defending Channel One. ""I will never agree with what that woman wrote about how we are lying. We check every fact. Our correspondents are out in all the hot spots, and video material confirms everything there that is happening,"" Andreeva said in a video clip posted on Telegram. The next day, Channel One broadcast and repeatedly covered President Vladimir Putin's speech to the nation where he baselessly claimed that Ukraine was committing genocide against Russians and wanted to build nuclear weapons. Putin told viewers that Ukraine has biowarfare labs intent on spreading deadly diseases, a piece of propaganda that has also circulated among far-right and QAnon conspiracy movements in the United States. In between the constant broadcast of Special Military Operation news and Putin's blistering addresses, Channel One broke to a panel show called 'Bol'shaya Igra' —'The Great Game'. A Russian lawmaker hosts the show, together with up to a half dozen panelists who stand around a video map showing the invasion of Ukraine. Each panelist offers their expertise and analysis, often in increasingly loud and angry voices. Sometimes they pound a hand on the table for emphasis. They denounce traitors, whip up threats and claim that the US and Ukraine are training migratory birds to infect Russians with bioweapons that will cause victims to lose their Slavic identity and grow to dislike traditional dishes. This is what state television in Russia is broadcasting around the clock, every day, and it doesn't show any sign of stopping.

4/19/2022,"BERLIN (AP) — Germany's employers and unions have joined together in opposing an immediate European Union ban on natural gas imports from Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, saying such a move would lead to factory shutdowns and the loss of jobs in the bloc's largest economy. “A rapid gas embargo would lead to loss of production, shutdowns, a further de-industrialization and the long-term loss of work positions in Germany,” said Rainer Dulger, chairman of the BDA employer's group, and Reiner Hoffmann, chairman of the DGB trade union confederation, in a joint statement Monday on Germany's dpa news agency. The statement comes as European leaders are discussing possible new energy sanctions against Russian oil, following a decision April 7 to ban Russian coal imports beginning in August. Ukraine's leaders say revenues from Russia's energy exports are financing Moscow's destructive war on Ukraine and must be ended. That won't be easy to do. The EU's 27 nations get around 40% of their natural gas from Russia and around 25% of their oil. Natural gas would be the most difficult do without, energy analysts say, since most of it comes by pipeline from Russia and supplies of liquefied gas, which can be ordered by ship, are limited amid strong demand worldwide. Germany, a major manufacturing hub and an importer of Russian gas, has so far resisted an immediate shutoff and said it plans to instead phase out Russian oil by the end of the year and most Russian gas imports by mid-2024. The EU's executive commission has outlined steps to cut the consumption of Russian gas by two-thirds by year's end through using more pipeline gas from Norway and Azerbaijan, importing more liqueifed gas, accelerating the deployment of wind and solar projects and intensifying conservation efforts. German Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck said in an interview with the Funke media group that “an immediate gas embargo would endanger social peace in Germany.” Despite widespread economic sanctions against Russian banks and individuals, the EU continues to send around $850 million per day to Russia for oil and gas, even as EU governments condemn the war in Ukraine. Gas-intensive companies include producers of glass, metals, ceramics and chemicals. Industry officials say natural gas would be difficult or impossible to replace in the short run. Analysts say Russian crude oil would be easier to replace than gas but that a boycott would still lead to higher energy prices that would hit consumers who are already facing record EU inflation of 7.5%. ___ Follow all AP stories on the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.",World/Associated Press,"German bosses, unions jointly oppose boycott of Russian gas",https://news.yahoo.com/german-bosses-unions-jointly-oppose-144157457.html
4/19/2022,"Russia may be on the cusp of its first default on its foreign debt since the Bolsheviks ousted Czar Nicholas II a century ago. On April 14, 2022, Moody’s Investors Service warned the country’s decision to make payments on dollar-issued debt in rubles would constitute a default because it violates the terms of the contract. A 30-day grace period allows Russia until May 4 to convert the payments to dollars to avoid default. A default is one of the clearest signals that the sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries are having their intended effect on the Russian economy. But will it have any impact on Russia’s ability to wage war in Ukraine? We asked Michael Allen and Matthew DiGiuseppe, both experts on political economy and conflict, to explain the consequences of default and what it would mean for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war. The Russian government has a total of US$40 billion worth of debt in dollars and euros, half of which is owned by foreign investors. Russia had an April 4 deadline to pay about $650 million in interest and principle to the holders of two bonds issued in dollars. Russia has plenty of cash – it collects the equivalent of over $1 billion a day from its oil and gas deliveries alone – but has limited access to dollars because of sanctions imposed by the U.S. The Biden administration had been allowing Russia to use some of the foreign reserves it had previously frozen to make debt payments. The U.S. changed course on April 5, when it blocked Russia from using dollar reserves held at American banks to make the debt payments. That gave Russia little choice but to try to make the payments in rubles, whose value has been very volatile since the invasion. If Russia doesn’t switch the payments to dollars by May 4, the government will be in default on its foreign obligations for the first time since 1918, when the Bolshevik revolutionaries took over Russia and refused to pay the country’s international creditors. Russia also defaulted in 1998 but only on its domestic debt. When a country defaults on a foreign loan, international investors typically become unwilling or unable to lend more money to it. Or they demand much higher interest rates. Whether because of higher interest costs or an inability to borrow, this forces a country to cut spending. Less government spending reduces economic activity, increases unemployment and slows growth. While some of these effects, like weaker economic growth, are often short-lived, other consequences can haunt a country for years. Trade with other countries remains below normal for an average of 15 years after a default, while full exclusion from capital markets typically lasts just over eight years. For example, when Argentina defaulted in 2001, the peso plunged, the economy shrank and inflation soared. Riots over food broke out all over the country, leading to the president’s resignation. Although Argentina’s economy had recovered by 2007, the country remained unable to borrow from foreign investors, which led to default again in 2014. What does this mean for Russia? The country was already locked out of international borrowing markets because of sanctions. A government official recently said Russia would also avoid borrowing domestically, because a default would lead to “cosmic” interest rates. But its significant revenue from sometimes-discounted sales of oil and gas may help offset the need for borrowing in the short term, especially if it can continue to find willing buyers like India and China. On April 14, 2022, Putin acknowledged sanctions were disrupting exports and raising costs. The Russian government has been trying hard to avoid default. Until April 5, it was using its precious dollars to stay current on its bond payments. And before its invasion it had built up a significant reserve of foreign currency, in large part to allow it to continue to pay back debt borrowed in dollars and euros even amid sanctions. Russia has even threatened to take legal action if sanctions force it into default. As it odd as it may sound, Russia is likely worried about its reputation – at least among bond investors. A default by a sovereign borrower establishes a bad reputation that can take years to rehabilitate, as Argentina’s experience shows. And the long-term impact could be worse for Russia. The reason Russia is in this bind is because it chose to invade Ukraine, despite repeated warnings that doing so would result in severe economic and financial sanctions. So creditors might wonder if Russia will always prioritize its foreign policy interests over the interests of creditors and raise borrowing costs permanently. If so, they may find it difficult to borrow for years to come. Another risk is that a default may enable creditors to seize Russia’s overseas assets as a form of repayment. International sanctions have already enabled countries to seize or freeze Russian assets, which could be used to pay off outstanding debts. One count suggests that 50% of creditors in recent sovereign debt cases have attempted to seize assets as an alternative to payment. As long as there has been debt, governments have waged wars with other people’s money. In fact, debt has become so vital as a source of power that countries rarely fight without it. Around 88% of wars from 1823 through 2003 have been at least partly financed with funds borrowed from banks and other investors. This reality even bleeds into fantasy worlds, like “Game of Thrones,” in which financing from the Iron Bank of Braavos is vital to financing the wars of Westeros. Our own research has shown that countries that have defaulted on their debts or have poor credit ratings find it difficult to build military capacity and, consequently, are more reluctant to take up arms against other nations. Related work has found that countries with lower borrowing costs tend to win wars – though this effect is stronger for democracies. One reason is that borrowing allows countries to overcome the guns-versus-butter trade-off: More money spent on the military means less for its citizens’ welfare, which can hurt a government’s ability to stay in power. Foreign loans can help overcome this problem, but losing access to credit forces a government to choose. In the short term, however, a default is not likely to alter the outcome of Russia’s war – or force Putin to make any unpopular trade-offs – especially if Russia is able to achieve its new and more limited military objectives in the eastern Donbas region quickly. This will change the longer the war goes on. The war was expected to last only a few days, but a stronger-than-expected Ukrainian defense has pushed the conflict into its eighth week. Early estimates found that a prolonged war could end up costing Russia over $20 billion a day, including both direct and indirect expenses, like loss of economic output.

Roman statesman Cicero wrote: “Nervos belli, infinitam pecuniam,” which loosely translates as “Successful war-waging capacity requires unlimited cash.” And that means borrowed money. Wars usually end quickly without it. This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts. It was written by: Michael A.

4/19/2022,"(Reuters) -Two British fighters captured in Ukraine by Russian forces appeared on Russian state TV on Monday and asked to be exchanged for a Ukrainian ally of President Vladimir Putin who is being held by the Ukrainian authorities. It was unclear how freely the two men - Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin - were able to talk. Both spoke separately after being prompted by an unidentified man. The footage was broadcast on the Rossiya 24 state TV channel. The two men asked British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to exchange them for pro-Russian politician Viktor Medvedchuk. Medvedchuk was shown asking to be swapped too in a video released around the same time on Monday by Ukraine's SBU intelligence service via social media. Medvedchuk, in his appeal to Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy, asked to be exchanged for the ""defenders of Mariupol and its citizens who are there today and have no opportunity for a safe exit through a humanitarian corridor."" Medvedchuk is the leader of Ukraine's Opposition Platform - For Life party and an ally of Putin who spent years advocating closer ties between Russia and Ukraine. Both Pinner and Aslin fought on the Ukrainian side in Mariupol, which is now almost entirely under Russian control apart from the sprawling Azovstal steelworks where some Ukrainian fighters remained holed up. The unidentified man shown on Russian state TV was seen showing the two Britons a video on his mobile phone of Medvedchuk's wife, Oksana, making an appeal over the weekend for her husband to be swapped for the two British nationals. APPEALS TO BORIS JOHNSON Three days after Russia moved its forces into Ukraine on Feb. 24, Ukraine said Medvedchuk had escaped from house arrest. He had been confined to his home in May 2021 and charged with high treason and later with aiding terrorism. The pro-Russian figure, who says Putin is godfather to his daughter, has denied wrongdoing and alleged that he is the victim of politically-motivated repression. He was captured by Ukraine last week. ""I understand the situation,"" Pinner, who was wearing a blue hooded top and looked tired and nervous, said after being shown the video. ""I'd like to appeal to the (British) government to send me back home, I'd like to see my wife again,"" he said. Pinner made a direct appeal to Johnson which he said was on behalf of himself and Aslin. ""We look to exchange myself and Aiden Aslin for Mr Medvedchuk. Obviously I would really appreciate your help in this matter,"" he said, saying he spoke a little Russian and had been treated well. The unidentified man was then shown speaking to Aslin, who was sat on a chair wearing a T-shirt bearing the emblem of Ukraine's far-right Azov battalion. ""I think that Boris (Johnson) needs to listen to what Oksana (Medvedchuk's wife) has said,"" said Aslin, who looked nervous. ""If Boris Johnson really does care like he says he does about British citizens then he would help pressure Zelenskiy to do the right thing and return Viktor to his family and return us to our families."" The British Foreign Office had no immediate comment on the footage but released a statement made by the Pinner family. ""Our family is currently working with the Foreign Office along with the family of Aiden Aslin who is also being held by the Russian Army to ensure their rights as Prisoners Of War are upheld according to the Geneva Convention,"" the statement said. Russia has said it will keep a close eye on Medvedchuk's fate and last week told Ukraine ""to watch out"" after Kyiv captured him and released photographs of him in handcuffs.
