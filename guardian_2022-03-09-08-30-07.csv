3/9/2022,"Russian planes that stray into British airspace could be detained by the British government, the transport secretary announced on Tuesday. Grant Shapps said he had made it a criminal offence for any Russian aircraft to enter UK airspace, as the government scrambles to sanction Russia for its brutal war on Ukraine. He tweeted: “I have made it a criminal offence for ANY Russian aircraft to enter UK airspace and now HMG can detain these jets. “We will suffocate [Vladimir] Putin’s cronies’ ability to continue living as normal while thousands of innocent people die.” He also published a letter, sent to all UK airports and airfields, outlining the new measures, including giving air traffic control powers to “issue directions to a pilot or operator of a Russian aircraft not to enter UK airspace, or to leave it by a certain route”. It read: “The aviation sector is fundamental to connectivity and international trade and we must play our part in restricting Russia’s economic interests and holding the Russian government to account. “In these circumstances the Department for Transport does not consider it appropriate for Russian aircraft to enter UK airspace or land at UK airports.” Most European nations, including the UK, closed airspace to Russian aircraft last week in response to the invasion of Ukraine. The closures have left Russian airlines facing an almost complete blockade from flying west over Europe after they were barred from the airspace of nearly 30 countries. Airlines from many of those countries, including the UK, now face higher fuel costs and longer journey times on flights to Asia and beyond after Russia retaliated by banning their carriers from its airspace.",News/UK news,Russian planes that enter UK airspace could be detained by government,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/08/russian-planes-that-enter-uk-airspace-could-be-detained-by-government
3/9/2022,"Jürgen Klopp insisted Liverpool deserved to progress to the Champions League quarter-finals despite the defeat in the second leg of their tie with Internazionale but called on his side to avoid a repeat of the performance that consigned them to a first home defeat in over a year and yielded a nervous evening for everyone present at Anfield. Lautaro Martínez’s second-half strike breathed life into the tie after Liverpool’s 2-0 win in Milan three weeks ago, but within seconds of the Argentinian’s long-range effort Alexis Sánchez was shown a second yellow card for a tackle on Fabinho to hand the momentum back to Klopp’s side. Liverpool had enough chances of their own to kill the tie long before Martínez’s goal, with Mohamed Salah striking the post twice, Joël Matip heading the ball against the crossbar and a remarkable last-ditch clearance from Arturo Vidal denying Luis Díaz in the final moments. But Klopp said that while he felt his side did enough over the two legs, the performance at Anfield acts as a warning for the challenges which lie ahead. “These things can happen, but you have to make sure you don’t do it again and be better next time,” he said. “We could have played better, but not too much better because the opponent was really good. The art of football is to lose the right games. If there was any game we could have afforded to lose it was tonight, because the main target of this competition is to get through. But it’s not that I’m sat here over the moon.” Klopp said: “It’s fair we’re through against a really strong opponent and now, let’s carry on. Over the two legs we deserved to go through, but we had some problems tonight, and one of those was the quality of the opposition.” Klopp described some of Liverpool’s missed chances as slapstick, adding his frustration about aspects of their performance, particularly in the first half. “I didn’t like our counterpress, we lost the ball in strange moments and then you have to chase the situation,” he said. Klopp insisted there could be no complaints with Sánchez’s dismissal, saying the Chilean was fortunate not to have been sent off for a challenge on Thiago in the first half. “He was quite lucky he didn’t get a different colour for that foul,” he said. “Passion is good, but if it leads to those things, it doesn’t help.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp tells Liverpool to learn from Internazionale defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/08/jurgen-klopp-tells-liverpool-to-learn-from-internazionale-defeat
3/9/2022,"Jonny Bairstow saluted the return of England’s travelling supporters and reiterated his passion for Test cricket after a sublime unbeaten century delivered a telling fightback in Antigua. The Yorkshireman walked off the field at stumps on day one of the first Test against West Indies with 109 not out from 216 balls against his name and England 286 for six following a rocky start to their Caribbean tour. Joe Root’s tourists had slumped to 48 for four in the morning session but in front of 5,000 supporters – the first overseas horde for an England Test match since the start of the pandemic – Bairstow’s second century of the winter provided a foothold. “It feels amazing,” said Bairstow, who after a watchful start bludgeoned 17 fours for his eighth Test century and put on a crucial stand of 99 with Ben Foakes for the sixth wicket. “I’m very passionate about playing for England and very passionate about playing Test cricket. I’m absolutely delighted, it’s been a good start to the year and hopefully that continues. “ To score a century in any Test is amazing but here with the travelling fans who haven’t been able to come for a few years – what an occasion.” Bairstow did not start the failed Ashes campaign and with more than 70 caps to his name at the time, many wondered if England would move on from the 32-year-old. Instead his century in Sydney, another last week in England’s tour game and this latest performance has hinted at a career now rejuvenated. In the absence of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, and with Jos Buttler similarly dropped, Bairstow’s name has also been more heavily referenced on tour as a senior player in the squad. It is a backing the right-hander admitted to relishing as he beamed at the close of play. He said: “Yeah, I’m really enjoying it. To give Alex Lees his cap on debut is so special having known him so well. It has a good feeling around the place at the moment. It won’t all happen right away but if we put the right things in place in order to help people perform to the best of their abilities, that’s very important.” England’s horror morning with the bat brought memories of Australia flooding back but Bairstow stressed the mood in the dressing room felt different and put the early clatter of wickets down to a pitch that started off tacky due to moisture. The slow surface at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium has occasional variable bounce but looks to be rewarding the harder ball in the main, with the morning session on day two now key to England setting up a convincing first innings total. Jason Holder, fresh from immaculate figures of two for 15 from 16 overs, echoed this appraisal and the former West Indies captain gave a typically magnanimous answer when asked about Bairstow’s performance. Holder said: “It was an excellent innings. He allowed the ball to come to him early on and then he put us under pressure when we were too wide or too straight. That’s the sign of a good player. “If I’m being critical, we leaked too many boundaries. That’s something we need to look at. We need to make the second new ball count, get Jonny early and put more pressure on the rest, we’ll be in the game.”",Sport/Sport,‘It feels amazing’: Jonny Bairstow salutes travelling support after century,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/08/jonny-bairstow-salutes-support-after-first-test-century-england-west-indies
3/9/2022,"ACalifornia man who shot and killed his three daughters, a chaperone who was supervising a visit with the girls and then himself last month was armed with a ghost gun, law enforcement officials revealed. David Mora Rojas was visiting his daughters Samarah Mora Gutierrez, nine, Samantha Mora Gutierrez, 10, and Samia Mora Gutierrez, 13, at a Sacramento church on 28 February when he opened fire. Nathaniel Kong, 59, an employee of the church who was supervising Mora Rojas’s time with the children, was also killed. Mora Rojas, 39, was banned from owning any guns and ammunition due to a domestic violence restraining order filed by the girls’ mother. But he was still able to get a ghost gun, a firearm without a serial number, usually bought online and assembled in someone’s home. Mora Rojas used a homemade semi-automatic rifle-style weapon and an extended magazine with 30 rounds. He used 17. “It’s horrifying but not surprising,” said David Pucino, deputy chief counsel for the Giffords Law Center, of the use of a ghost gun in the Sacramento church shooting. Do-it-yourself firearm kits – once a niche hobby among gun enthusiasts – have been around since the 90s. But they grew into an evening news staple in the 2010s. In California, homemade guns were used in a 2013 mass shooting in Santa Monica, a 2014 bank robbery in Stockton and a shooting spree in rural Tehama county that killed six in 2017. In 2019, a 16-year-old killed two students and injured three others before killing himself with a ghost gun at a school in Santa Clarita. The next year, as protests over police violence filled city streets, Steven Carrillo used a homemade machine gun to shoot two security guards at a federal building in Oakland and a sheriff’s deputy in an ambush in Santa Cruz. Law enforcement agencies have said they mainly recoverd ghost guns during large police raids and in underground trafficking operations. But in recent years they have also increasingly been found in the trunk of vehicles and in the hands of individuals and during gun buybacks. Violence preventionists say ghost guns have also become popular in lower-income Black and Latino communities where gun violence tends to be concentrated. Ghost guns are no’t subject to some of the laws regulating firearms purchases, especially in a state with strict weapons laws like California. In October, California added ghost guns to the prohibited list of firearms for people with a domestic order against them. California law requires anyone who buys a firearm to pass a background check and, if they assemble one themselves, they also must apply for a serial number. But when it comes to homemade guns, that process is usually only followed by gun hobbyists. Without a serial number or unique manufacturer markings, the guns are nearly impossible to trace through traditional means. These days, ghost guns are easier to get than other trafficked weapons, advocates and police have said. “Ghost guns are a really attractive way for traffickers to source guns quickly,” Pucino continued. “And California’s laws about homemade firearms don’t actually inhibit someone from getting one.” Amid their high profile proliferation – 65% of the ghost guns seized nationwide in 2020 were found in California – local and state officials have attempted to prevent ghost guns from entering city streets with lawsuits and bans. Prosecutors and attorneys have filed lawsuits against popular ghost gun manufacturers over alleged illegal business practices and negligence that led to shootings like that of Mia Tretta at Saugus high school in 2019. Localities including San Diego, San Francisco and Oakland have also levied city-wide bans that make it illegal for any resident to possess or buy an unserialized gun. In January, state assembly member Mike Gipson, of southern California, introduced a bill that would ban ghost guns statewide, and later that month he joined Senator Dianne Feinstein in calling on the nation’s mayors to enact similar prohibitions. And in July, an amendment to a California ammunition law will require people to pass a background check before buying a gun kit and mandates ghost gun retailers submit purchase records to the state’s department of justice. The amendment, also authored by Gipson, passed in 2019, and is set to be implemented three years earlier than originally planned due to concerns over the use of ghost guns. But violence prevention advocates say the efforts are only a bandage until the federal government creates policies that would regulate ghost guns and the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) closes the legal loophole that has allowed ghost gun makers to evade federal gun guidelines like background checks and serial numbers. “Ghost gun companies have been resistant to any regulations and it’s clear that they see their business model existing because of the legal loopholes they can exploit,” Pucino said. “They don’t want to compete with the gun manufacturers that have to follow regulations. “[States and local governments] are using the tools at their disposal but the federal government needs to step in,” he added. “The longer ATF delays, more ghost guns will be available and they will be used in more shootings.” During a recent firearm trade show the ATF’s acting director told attendees that a long-awaited rule that would require a background check before someone buys untraceable gun parts would not be ready in July, according to the New York Times. This most recent high-profile mass shooting has intensified calls for gun control, increased protections for domestic violence survivors and their children. “Time and time again, we see these high power weapons on our streets that land in the hands of those who continue to kill our babies,” assembly member Gipson said in a statement after the Sacramento shooting. “This is exactly what keeps me up at night! We are not safe. Our babies aren’t safe. Even when we go to the extent of getting a restraining order and following every step possible to protect them.”",News/US news,A father used a ghost gun to kill his three daughters.

3/9/2022,"Sixteen years since his last novel, The Road, Cormac McCarthy’s long awaited follow-up has finally been confirmed – with not one, but two new novels to be published one month apart later this year. The Passenger, out in October, and Stella Maris, out in November, follow siblings Bobby and Alicia Western, “who are tormented by the legacy of their father, a physicist who helped develop the atom bomb”, reported the New York Times on Tuesday. Regarded as one of the greatest living US writers, 88-year-old McCarthy has not published a novel since The Road in 2006. The post-apocalyptic survival story won the Pulitzer prize and became a bestseller. It’s an unusually long gap for the novelist, who has published 10 novels since 1965. The Passenger has been highly anticipated since 2009, when a Texas university acquired McCarthy’s archive, including notes for an unfinished novel with that working title; however, the notes were restricted until publication. The acquisition revealed that McCarthy was then working on three novels – but there had been no update in the decade since. On Tuesday evening, US publisher Knopf revealed McCarthy had the two books coming in 2022. McCarthy had delivered a full draft of one of the novels to his editors eight years ago, kept secret at the publishing house. The Passenger, published on 25 October, opens as Bobby, a salvage diver working on the Gulf Coast in 1980, explores the wreckage of a sunken jet. He discovers that the black box, the pilot’s bag and one of the dead passengers are all missing. The 400-page novel has “the pace and twists of a thriller” as Bobby is drawn into the mystery of the crash. Stella Maris marks the first time McCarthy has focused on a female protagonist. The 200-page novel, out on 22 November, follows Bobby’s sister Alicia, “a math prodigy whose intellect frightens people and whose hallucinations appear as characters, with their own distinct voices”. “I was planning on writing about a woman for 50 years,” McCarthy told the Wall Street Journal in a 2009 interview. “I will never be competent enough to do so, but at some point you have to try.” McCarthy’s editor at Knopf, Jenny Jackson, told the New York Times: “It’s a format for Cormac to allow Alicia to explore her obsessions, which from what I can tell happen to be Cormac’s obsessions. It’s a book of ideas.” When the manuscripts were completed, Knopf considered publishing the books as one volume, both on the same day or a year apart, but settled on a one-month gap. “Here we have not one but two novels by pretty much America’s greatest living novelist,” Knopf publisher Reagan Arthur said. “How do we publish in a way that gives readers time to experience each one but also gives readers the satisfaction of experiencing the conversation between the two novels?” The two novels mark a departure for McCarthy, who has set most of his works in the American south and southwest, exploring humanity’s capacity for good and evil in austere tales of great violence and depravity. The New York Times reported that McCarthy has been fascinated with mathematics and theoretical physics for years, having surrounded himself with experts in both fields at the Santa Fe Institute, a research institute where he has worked for decades. McCarthy, who rarely gives interviews and declined to speak for the announcement, is not unaware of the anticipation. Asked by Oprah Winfrey in 2007 if he cared that he had millions of readers, he said: “In all honesty I have to say I really don’t. You would like for the people who appreciate the book to read it, but, as far as many, many people reading it, so what?”",Arts/Books,"Cormac McCarthy: two new novels coming in 2022, 16 years after The Road",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/09/cormac-mccarthy-two-new-novels-coming-in-2022-16-years-after-the-road
3/9/2022,"It’s such a fertile premise, so resonant with the times that you wonder why we aren’t besieged with dramas, documentaries and podcasts set in and around the mid-17th century – time of civil war, plague and an equally poisonous outbreak of misogyny that gave England literal witch-hunts. But no matter. It’s a time and a set of subjects that’s just as ripe for comedy – as black and bitter, you might expect, as a suspicious old crone’s brew – and here comes one with as distinguished a cast and pedigree as you could hope. The Witchfinder (BBC Two) is written by Neil and Rob Gibbons, who gave us the glorious return of Steve Coogan as his most famous character, in the pitch-perfect daytime television spoof This Time with Alan Partridge (Coogan is listed as a script consultant on the new show) and it stars – well, everyone you’d want it to, really. It features Tim Key (Partridge’s hapless sidekick Simon, known as Sidekick Simon, in This Time and who has long deserved the upgrade to main role that he gets here, even if he does seem to be exactly half Coogan and half Ricky Gervais in content and delivery), Daisy May Cooper (from the impeccable This Country), comedy stalwart Jessica Hynes, Daniel Rigby (an unforgettable Eric Morecambe in 2011 and great in everything since) and various other familiar faces that let you know you should be in for a good time. Alas, that time never really arrives. Key plays failing Norfolk witchfinder Gideon Bannister – we first meet him trying on a new witchfinding hat, hoping it will change his fortunes – and Hynes his spirit-bolstering companion Old Myers. Rigby plays his more successful and bumptious rival Hebble and Cooper plays Thomasine Gooch, an unmarried woman who is inevitably accused of witchcraft. She points out that there are many other unmarried women around. “There’s something not right about the way you’re unmarried,” comes the unanswerable answer. If the programme featured more of this kind of thing – satirical evocations of another time and its insane contradictions (especially in light of how many we find ourselves in the middle of today) – it might work. There is plenty of scope, if you know your period well enough, to do a Blackadder and fill the script with clever, acute jokes (was Puritan ideology ever as well captured as in: “I sit on Nathaniel. Two spikes would be an extravagance!”?) that put some meat on daft bones. It has occasional fine flourishes, but for the most part The Witchfinder unfortunately seems as if it was put together by people who remember a GCSE plague project, have read the Wikipedia entry for 17th-century witchfinder Matthew Hopkins and hoped that would be enough. There aren’t too many jokes of the more straightforward kind, either. The actors bring as much as they can to the parts, without ever hamming it up, but lines such as “Scripture, scruples, scrutiny – the three Scr’s” are never going to raise much more than a smile even with the most generous-hearted viewers. The story is thin. The Witchfinder General’s right-hand man, John Stearne, visits Gideon’s village and is murdered, allowing Gideon to set off for his next meeting in the hope of taking his place and finally moving up the ranks (“I would love three dead kids – proper witchcraft.”) He takes the accused Thomasine with him to provide material for a trial once he gets there. Cooper’s Thomasine is essentially the pathologically obdurate Kerry from This Country with intelligence, which makes her an absolutely formidable force and far-from-ideal companion for Gideon as they set off on a thwarted journey across the Civil War-stricken countryside towards their destination. She ponders his pay structure, which grants him more for a guilty verdict than a finding of innocence: “Wonder if that’s the best way of doing it?” But she, like Hynes (who I don’t think is given a single punchline – her every scene seems to end before anyone was moved to find one), is woefully underused. Whether this is just part and parcel of a programme whose every aspect is underbaked and doesn’t seem to know how to make best use of most of its gifts, or some manifestation of the enduring boys’-club nature of comedy writing and commissions, I don’t know. Only two episodes of the six were available for review, so maybe it tightens up, adds more jokes, Blackadderish moments – some darkness in the mould of Julia Davis’s sitcom Hunderby would be equally welcome – and thickens the plot to reward the goodwill viewers bring to projects with such pedigrees. I hope so. At the moment, it’s a comedy with so much wasted potential it makes me sad.",Arts/Television & radio,The Witchfinder review – a comedy with so much wasted potential it makes you sad,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/08/the-witchfinder-review-a-comedy-with-so-much-wasted-potential-it-makes-you-sad
3/9/2022,"Measures to protect people from internet scams will now be included in proposed online safety laws, the government has said. Under a previous draft of the online safety bill, platforms which host user-generated content would have a “duty of care” to protect users from fraud by other users. However, with this new change, the bill will require online platforms to protect them not just from user-generated scams, but also from pre-paid fraudulent adverts appearing on their services. These will include unlicensed financial promotions, or fraudsters impersonating legitimate businesses, as well as ads for fake companies. The change will affect the largest and most influential social media companies and search engines including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Google. According to the bill, such platforms and search engines will need to put in place “proportionate systems and processes to prevent the publication and/or hosting of fraudulent advertising on their service and remove it when they are made aware of it”. An example of these fake ads includes posts seen on Google and Facebook which impersonated and used the image of Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, in attempts to defraud users. News of the changes to the bill coincides with the government’s launch of a public consultation on its online advertising programme, which will look at current regulations and assess whether they are being adequately funded. The results of the public consultation could mean that influencers who fail to declare social media posts to be ads when they are paid to promote products could be subject to stronger penalties. Commenting on the changes made to the bill, Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, said: “We want to protect people from online scams and have heard the calls to strengthen our new internet safety laws. “These changes to the upcoming online safety bill will help stop fraudsters conning people out of their hard-earned cash using fake online adverts.” Lewis said: “I am thankful the government has listened to me and the huge numbers of other campaigners – across banks, insurers, consumer groups, charities, police and regulators – who’ve been desperate to ensure scam adverts are covered by the online safety bill. “We are amidst an epidemic of scam adverts. Scams don’t just destroy people’s finances – they hit their self-esteem, mental health and even leave some considering taking their own lives.“The government now accepting the principle that scam adverts need to be included, and that firms who are paid to publish adverts need to be responsible for them, is a crucial first step. Until now, only user-generated scams were covered – which risked pushing more scam ads, incentivising criminals to shift strategy.” The online safety bill is currently being subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by a joint committee of MPs and peers.",Lifestyle/Money,Internet scams to be included in UK online safety bill,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/08/internet-scams-now-included-in-uk-online-safety-bill
