4/17/2022,"Craig Taylor felt a mix of thrill and dread when he sat down beside the leader of the most deadly gang operating in Ireland and the UK and began secretly filming. Notoriously observant and adept in evaluating if he was being watched or followed, Christopher Kinahan Sr was one of the most-wanted criminal figures in the world, founder of a cartel ranked alongside the Italian mafia and the brutal Los Zetas in Mexico. Remarkably, on that occasion, Kinahan didn’t appear to notice the plain-clothes officer from the UK’s National Crime Agency. And Taylor acquired fresh intelligence in the attempt to dismantle the Kinahan cartel, which has generated more than £850m in proceeds from drugs, firearms and extortion. Last Tuesday, the NCA’s intelligence on Kinahan was among the evidence used by US officials to announce financial sanctions against the Kinahan organised crime group (KOCG), along with a $5m reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Christopher Kinahan Sr and other senior members. Currently, the 65-year-old is living at an opulent address in Dubai, close to the Palm Jumeirah development where his son, Daniel, is said to oversee criminal transactions. Daniel has also used his wealth to become one of the most influential figures in boxing, with links to individuals such as world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury. With investigations under way, the Observer has interviewed three veteran frontline NCA officers tasked with collating information on a transnational crime syndicate known to have murdered at least 12 people, mainly their rivals. On condition of anonymity, the operatives reveal the challenges and dangers attached to getting close to the Kinahan cartel. Not only are Kinahan members highly attuned to identifying police who may be tracking them, but police face the genuine risk of corruption within law enforcement with individuals on its payroll and others vulnerable to bribes. The officers, some of whom have tracked the rise of the Kinahan group for 15 years, say the cartel uses high-level counter-surveillance techniques, which NCA sources believe are “highly likely” to have been passed down from IRA operatives and honed during the Troubles. On at least two occasions, NCA officers tracking Kinahan activity have been approached and intimidated by cartel members. It is well established that the cartel has amassed significant lethal weaponry. In 2017, in a village outside Dublin, gardaí found bespoke “murder kits” linked to the group: loaded revolvers and ammunition for members to deploy at a moment’s notice. NCA officer Taylor (not his real name) has been tracking the cartel since 2006. He said: “Colleagues have been approached by some very, very undesirable people, some in the company of convicted armed robbers, others with affiliations to political groups,... and have been challenged. It’s very intimidating. These people are saying: ‘We know who you are.’ “It’s not a good place to be, it’s very uncomfortable but we work under the risk of compromise. With the Kinahans there have been compromises. It hasn’t compromised the investigation but it’s compromised them [the officers] as an individual, which at the time put them in a very difficult position.” Incidents where police investigating the group have been placed at risk include one occasion where colleagues had to rescue an officer. “During an investigation peripheral to the Kinahans they were chased down the road with a knife. Another was chased in a car,” said an NCA operative. Investigators also reveal how the Kinahan cartel has invested some of its wealth to employ specialist advisers who train members in the latest “tradecraft” techniques to help evade detection. Similarly, technology such as sophisticated tracking devices is regularly employed by the criminals to follow consignments of drugs and guns – and possibly targets. Matt Horne, deputy director of investigations at the NCA, said the adoption of counter-surveillance measures by Kinahan members was two-fold. “You need to be able to find out where your opponents are, when they might be vulnerable. But if you understand how to do surveillance, you learn how to spot surveillance. “That makes it quite awkward for us. When some of the tricks of the trade are known it makes it harder to put people under surveillance,” added Horne, who is directing the NCA operation against the Kinahan crime group. Last month, he celebrated the jailing of Thomas “Bomber” Kavanagh, who ran the UK arm of the Kinahan’s criminal empire. The 54-year-old, who lived in a fortified mansion with bulletproof windows in Tamworth, Staffordshire, was imprisoned for orchestrating multimillion-pound drug shipments. Although the NCA has been investigating the Kinahan organisation since 2006, it took a full decade for the extent of its capacity for violence to become fully evident. More precisely, it was only after gunmen armed with AK-47s stormed a boxing weigh-in at a Dublin hotel on 5 February 2016. During the guerrilla-style assault, Kinahan gang member David Byrne was killed and another high-ranking member was shot in the leg. Yet the attack’s principal target – Daniel Kinahan – had left moments before the gunmen, some disguised as elite gardaí, and one dressed as a woman, arrived. Kinahan swore revenge against the rival Dublin-based Hutch gang, which was responsible. Since the brazen attack, 18 people have been murdered as a result of the feud, most of them by the Kinahan cartel. In addition, officers have linked the Kinahan syndicate to a further 23 attempted murders. Gardaí have also intervened on 46 occasions following “threat to life” intelligence, often involving hitmen. NCA officers have prevented another eight “threat to life” incidents involving the cartel in the UK. The Kinahans’ alertness to police surveillance techniques has also heightened the danger to investigating officers in other ways, with sources saying a constant fear is being mistaken for rival gangsters. “When Kinahan members are doing anti- and counter-surveillance for rival gangs, and we are out and about, they might not recognise us,” said an NCA officer. “They don’t necessarily know the good guys from the bad – and that can put us in a difficult position.” Compounding policing difficulties are the steps that the Kinahan leadership take to ensure they are far removed from criminality. Not only are criminal proceeds distributed among a labyrinthine network of shell companies, and communications are encrypted, but figures like Christopher and Daniel Kinahan have relocated from Dublin to Dubai, which has no extradition agreement with Ireland or the UK. “You won’t catch them running out of a car with five kilos of cocaine, that’s for sure. They’re far removed from that level of criminality: the cartel structure is extremely hierarchical,” said an NCA investigator. This, says Horne, may have helped convince senior Kinahan figures that they were “untouchable”, which is why Daniel Kinahan has felt sufficiently emboldened to become one of the most influential figures in boxing, with individuals like Fury publicly praising him. For police, however, getting close to the founder of the Kinahan cartel offers a constant challenge. “Most assignments have provided various levels of bum twitching. Still, I’ve managed to get up close to the main man [Christopher Kinahan Sr], who fortunately didn’t pay any attention to me because I was filming. But I was quite nervous,” said Taylor, who is not permitted to share further details of the encounter for security reasons. There are plenty of reasons to be cautious. In a European context, the violence of the Kinahan cartel is striking: its feud with the Hutch gang is one of the continent’s bloodiest. “The key difference is the high level of violence they use. That really marks them out, along with the lengths they go to to make sure that vendettas are followed through,” said one of the NCA officers. Horne describes the Kinahans as a “high threat, high harm” organisation that plays a significant role in the supply of drugs to Europe. Yet despite the cartel’s ruthlessness in eliminating rivals, the NCA has never found any intelligence indicating that the Kinahans have intended to target police. Danger, though, does come from the ranks of police themselves, with NCA sources admitting that the cartel has both exploited and benefited from high-level corruption. “We’ve always been acutely aware of the risk of this group in particular. Operational security is paramount due to their wealth and how they seek to protect themselves,” said a source. However, Horne points out that the fact that international sanctions were announced – measures that required complex coordination with global partners – and the Kinahan cartel were apparently oblivious, is a positive sign. “They had no indication this was coming,” said Horne. Preparations to remove the senior levels of the Kinahan cartel from international banking systems have been under way for years, with the NCA and international law enforcement partners raising the issue of sanctions with US officials in September 2019. Further sanctions may yet follow, with police investigating the group on a number of fronts. At the same time, pressure is growing on the UAE authorities to act against Kinahan, though the NCA stresses that it has an “excellent relationship” with the Gulf state. “It’s not finished by any stretch, not until we fully dismantle this cartel,” said Taylor.",News/World news,Catching the Kinahans: the officers risking their lives to jail Ireland’s most violent gang leaders,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/16/kinahans-officers-risking-lives-to-jail-ireland-most-violent-gang-leaders

With her family and favoured musicians in support, it’s a celebratory affair, mixing new material and old favourites. The title track, for example, is a 1992 collaboration with the late US pianist George Duke, a piece of jazz-funk given a more Brazilian flavour this time around, with trademark vocals that shift from lyrics to wordless exaltation – Purim’s daughter Diana is on hand to carry on the torch in convincing style. From further back, when Purim first crossed from Brazilian to international fame, is 500 Miles High, originally recorded with Chick Corea’s group in 1974 and here presented pretty much intact. A greater transformation is worked on This Is Me, an intricate workout penned by percussionist (and husband) Airto Moreira, its lyrics re-worked by Diana. She has made waves of her own in recent years, and nabs a couple more writing credits – let’s keep it in the family – but the other standouts are Zahuroo by Claudia Villela, a supercharged samba, and Dois + Dois = Tres, an unexpectedly bluesy outing on which guitarist José Neto shines.

4/17/2022,"Since powdered rhino horn has (rightly) been banned, only two aphrodisiacs remain: political power and great wealth. Of these, the second is the more interesting, partly because most humans, especially journalists, seem to be affected by it. It’s what leads them to assume that if someone is fabulously rich, then she or he must be very smart. That’s why the super-rich are invariably surrounded by fawning sycophants – and also why they eventually come to believe that they themselves are geniuses. Which brings us neatly to Peter Thiel, Silicon Valley’s leading contrarian. With a net worth of perhaps $5bn (£3.9bn), he is undoubtedly rich, though not in the Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos or even Bill Gates league. But since he is the only public intellectual that the tech industry has produced, there is a widespread belief that he must also be a deep thinker, which is why organisations ask him to give “keynote” speeches. The function of such addresses is to give an elevated tone to what are otherwise sordid proceedings, which explains why Thiel was invited to address the 2022 bitcoin conference in Miami, which was billed as “a four-day pilgrimage for those seeking greater freedom and individual sovereignty”. Given that the attendees at this shindig were likely subscribers to the view that he is a genius, it was an easy gig for the great man. Think of it as Narendra Modi addressing the annual conference of the Bharatiya Janata party and you’ll get the general idea. Thiel was there to tell the attendees that they were the Lord’s anointed. Bitcoin is the new gold that one day should take its place alongside the precious metal as the world’s store of value, replacing equities (ie company shares), which, at $115tn are currently much bigger than gold ($12tn). This will happen when the value of a single bitcoin (currently about £30,000) will increase by at least a hundredfold, making a single coin worth £3m. But it will only happen if a sinister cabal of old-world reactionaries – the “finance gerontocracy” of the veteran investor Warren Buffett, Jamie Dimon (head of JP Morgan Chase) and Larry Fink (chief executive of BlackRock) – is defeated. Stirring stuff, eh? The strange thing is that this call to arms was delivered in such a shambling manner. Here is a literal transcription of the relevant passage, starting 14 minutes into Thiel’s speech: “Why has it [bitcoin] not yet converged with gold for, um, or even with the equity markets more broadly, and what what is going to, you know, what is it going to take for this for this to happen? And, ah, I know that sort of the ways we oftentimes talk about, um, businesses or technologies, you know, how great the technology is, how great the code is, how great the math is, you know, how how it’s sort of innovative, but I want to sort of suggest that we should maybe think of, we should think of, we should think of it at least in one dimension as sort of a political question and it’s a movement and it’s a political question whether this movement is going to, um, succeed or whether, um, whether the enemies of the movement are going to succeed in stopping us and so I want to maybe end with, um, you know, an enemies list.” Thiel’s rhetorical deficiencies make him an unlikely leader of a political movement. But the aphrodisiacal effect of his wealth meant that his speech was widely reported. Yet the strange thing is that his record as an investor seems patchy, to say the least. He made his first pile from PayPal, which was a shrewd bet. He was the first big investor in Facebook, sure, but then he tried to persuade Mark Zuckerberg to sell it to Yahoo for $1bn in 2006 and then sold much of his holding after the company’s IPO in 2012. He foresaw the banking catastrophe of 2008, but failed to sell out beforehand. And, according to his biographer, much of his wealth comes from his skill at finding clever ways to limit his tax exposure: his investments in Facebook, Palantir and some others were made through a vehicle known as a Roth IRA that was originally intended for “ordinary” people – ie middle-class taxpayers. As David Runciman put it in his book review of Max Chafkin’s The Contrarian: Peter Thiel and Silicon Valley’s Pursuit of Power: “Thiel is not a genius investor. He is, like almost everyone else, a nervous investor, prone to panic and regret. He’s just another hedgie chasing his tail.” But if Thiel isn’t a genius, or even a latterday Cicero, he’s nevertheless dangerous. In an essay published in 2009 he famously said that he no longer believed that freedom and democracy are compatible. And he’s using his money to try to change the balance of power in the deadlocked US Senate in the next round of congressional elections by giving two $10m donations to the Super Pacs that are backing two of his proteges, JD Vance and Arizona Republican Blake Masters. In that sense, Thiel looks less like a tech genius and more like the Koch Brothers – Charles and his late sibling, David – who have done more to reshape Republican politics than anyone other than Donald J Trump. And that’s a good reason for taking him seriously, whatever happens to bitcoin.

4/17/2022,"From behind the counter in a bakery in Kasımpaşa, a working-class Istanbul neighbourhood, Mustafa Kafadar can see the orange, white and blue banners of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party (AKP) as they blow in the spring breeze. Kafadar has been wrenched out of retirement by Turkey’s economic crisis – his pension is no longer enough to cover his basic expenses. Now he works shifts in the bakery, where he describes living from payday to payday while he sweeps crumbs off a tray. “Everything’s very expensive. After I buy my essentials and pay my bills, there’s nothing left,” he says. Asked who is responsible, he chuckles darkly. “You know who makes inflation high,” he says cryptically, reluctant to voice his opinion of Erdoğan’s economic policies directly. “Not me, not you, not someone on the street – but who?” Kafadar has requested that his name be changed for his safety. Turkey is weathering an unprecedented financial crisis. After the lira lost half its value last year alone, the country is now struggling with rocketing inflation, officially 61.14%. Kafadar arranges rows of delicate breakfast pastries – fluffy round açma filled with olives or chocolate, börek and glossy poğaça buns – as customers arrive. He tells me they sometimes fly into a rage with him about prices. Jars of pink and white sugared almonds and an entire counter of elegant layer cakes, decorated with fruit and chocolate, sit untouched, now a little too pricey for most. “Sugar and wheat prices have gone up. A kilogram bag of flour was 110 lira [£6.15] back in January; now it’s 220 lira,” he says. Pointing at some of the cheapest buns, he adds: “We couldn’t make the prices of the poğaças any higher, as people can’t afford it.” When Turkey’s official inflation rate broke 50% in February, it represented both a two-decade high and a huge political problem for the government. The finance minister, Nureddin Nebati, insisted earlier this month that the surge was “temporary”, while Erdoğan recently vowed to protect Turks against inflation. “As the Turkish economy is getting ready to become one of the world’s top 10 economies, we have said that we will not waste this opportunity with careless and thoughtless steps,” he said. “We will get out of this situation in a way that will not crush our citizens with inflation.” Spiralling inflation is tied to the government’s efforts to radically overhaul the Turkish economy, keeping interest rates low in the belief that this will stimulate it and increase production – against the advice of most experts. There have also been frequent changes in key personnel at the central bank – Turkey has now had four central bank chiefs in three years. “Yes, everyone is experiencing inflation worldwide, but Turkey is experiencing it at almost four or five times the rate of others,” says Alp Erinç Yeldan, an economist at Istanbul’s Kadir Has University. “This is after a series of policy mistakes and ambitious expansionary projects, including following an economic policy that evades the rules of gravity.” The inflation rate has become a political issue in itself: In January, Erdoğan fired the head of TÜİK, the country’s official statistics agency, angry that official inflation data for last year showed a record high. The independent economic research group Enag, which monitors Turkey’s inflation rate using the same metrics as the government, calculates real inflation was 142.63% in March. “One hundred and forty-two per cent is hyperinflation, no doubt about it.” says Yeldan. Since rising prices began to bite last September, Enag’s calculations of real inflation have consistently been double the official rate, he adds. Turkey’s financial crisis has been further compounded by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has driven up global food prices, particularly for wheat. The lira’s slide against the dollar was already affecting Turkey’s ability to import wheat, but the loss of Ukrainian supplies has left it scrambling to find alternatives, including dipping into its own reserves. ‘I paid a 1,000 lira electricity bill in February, just for these two machines,” says Mehmet Aslan, pointing at two refrigerators holding cured meat, cheese and plump yellow rounds of butter from the town of Rize, where his family comes from (as does Erdoğan’s). Last Ramadan, Aslan says his shop was bringing in 6,000-7,000 lira a day in sales; this year he’s lucky if it breaks 1,500 lira. “People are making up prices,” he adds, pointing to a large jar of honey. “I could just make that 400 lira [£21] and no one would say anything. I could even make it 500.” Still, Aslan is reluctant to blame the government for the current state of affairs. “Inflation is now out of control of the government,” he says. “I’m not happy with prices. I blame the population – it’s beyond Erdoğan’s control and everyone’s trying to bring him down.” Turkey’s efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the war in Ukraine – catapulting Erdoğan back on to the world stage as a statesman rather than an aspiring autocrat – has helped deflect some of the criticism. His personal approval rating rose in March to 43.3%, while the AKP’s share of the vote increased by 3%, according to polling organisation Metropoll. Yet polls have also shown that more than half – 53.6% – of Turkish citizens were only just managing to meet basic needs last May, while a quarter said they couldn’t cover their essential costs. Earlier this year, delivery and supermarket workers staged prolonged strikes to demand wage increases in line with inflation. Energy costs in Turkey began to rise at the beginning of this year, but, as with the price of wheat, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sent them soaring. Turkey imports about a third of its gas from Russia. The state-owned pipeline operator Botas said this month that the price of gas for electricity generation would rise by almost 45%, with a 50% rise in prices for industry and 35% for households. As prices rose, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the leader of the opposition Republican People’s party (CHP), declared on camera that he would not pay his own electricity bill until Erdoğan brought prices down. AKP officials labelled this “a provocation”. Ordinary Turks remain “preoccupied with the economy”, says Ekrem Cunedioğlu, an economist with the opposition İyi party. It is hoping to persuade the Turkish public that it can fix the economy as elections, which are due by or before 2023, start to loom. “What we see from the data is rising deep poverty, meaning income not meeting basic needs. Inflation might reduce next year but deepening poverty will prove tougher to solve.” Pınar Duru, who runs a boutique bakery in Istanbul’s wealthy Cihangir neighbourhood, says she has started baking bread only to order and opening her shop at reduced times in order to save energy costs. “From October on, inflation began hitting hard,” she says. “I make brioche, and the price of everything, eggs, flour, sugar, butter … suddenly increased. It’s still doing so, on a daily basis – one day I check the price of eggs, and the next day it’s different.” Turkey’s efforts to find a solution in Ukraine, and potentially bring down food prices in the process, bring little solace, Duru adds. “It brings me no comfort or distraction – I live with the prices in my regular life, and my friends do too. Yes we talk about the war, but right now all we talk about is inflation,” she says. Prices are changing on a daily basis and everyone is scared for their future, she adds. “Unless I see the dollar go down, I’m not going to feel comfortable or secure.”",News/Business,Turkey’s war with inflation: ‘Prices change daily and everyone is scared’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/16/turkeys-war-with-inflation-prices-change-daily-and-everyone-is-scared
4/17/2022,"Average wage growth in Britain is not keeping pace with inflation, leaving workers facing the biggest annual fall in living standards since records began in the 1950s. Some employers, however, are ramping up bonuses in an attempt to lure new recruits and retain existing staff, as record job vacancies intensify the battle for talent and companies work to support staff hit by dwindling spending power. Figures from the Office for National Statistics last week showed the value of bonuses paid across the economy jumped by almost a quarter in the year to February, the highest level of one-off awards relative to basic wages since 2013. While the biggest payouts went to bankers and accountants in the City of London after a boom year for the finance industry, the data also reveals a marked rise in retail, construction and hospitality bonuses. In some sectors, employers are finding creative ways to attract and retain staff. Alongside a bumper 34% rise in finance bonuses, the ONS figures show payouts up by 20% in construction and by 19% in wholesale retail, hotels and restaurants. “Bonuses are a lot higher this year than last,” said Tony Wilson of the Institute for Employment Studies thinktank. “Across the economy it’s adding about a percentage point to pay growth right now. It’s being dragged up by large bonuses in finance, but there are proportionate big increases in other industries too.” Britain’s cost-of-living crisis hit its fourth month in February as average earnings growth, including bonuses, of 5.4% failed to keep pace with a 6.2% increase in the consumer price index. Inflation rose further in March, to 7%, and for those who didn’t get a bonus, things were far worse, with average pay up just 4%. Workers in the public sector are falling furthest behind, because one-off payouts are rare for NHS staff, council workers, teachers and police. In real terms, average weekly pay in the public sector is falling at the fastest rate in 20 years. Economists say there are two primary reasons why bosses could be considering paying bonuses. First, with record job vacancies and an unexpected fall in unemployment after the end of furlough, workers have more bargaining power. Several firms – including Starbucks, Domino’s Pizza and Holiday Inn – are using one-off joining bonuses to attract recruits: these can be more eyecatching than headline pay rates. Second, employers may believe the inflation shock is likely to fade next year. Paying one-off bonuses avoids permanently higher wage bills, at a time when firms are unsure about how profitable they might be in future. “The thing about wages is they are sticky. They go up but don’t go down very quickly,” said Jonathan Boys, a labour market economist at the Chartered Institute of Professional Development. “If you want sustained wage growth, it has to be because we’re better at doing stuff, we’re more productive. That’s the long-term gain.” Faced with soaring demand for international travel after lockdown, British Airways is offering £1,000 welcome bonuses – two years after it attempted to sack thousands of staff at the height of the pandemic. Sharon Graham, general secretary of the Unite union, which represents BA workers, said the “sign-on bribes” would do little to solve recruitment and retention problems if they still came with low base pay and lousy conditions. “It’s really very simple – to attract workers, employers have to offer pay and conditions that match, if not better, what’s on offer elsewhere,” she said. “That’s what Unite is fighting for – decent wages on decent conditions. So far, our collective bargaining strength has won a huge number of wage deals well above inflation.” Some employers are trying more creative retention techniques. According to jobs website Indeed, the number of vacancies offering perks such as wellbeing programmes – including mental health support – has risen by 1,719% compared with before the pandemic. Employers are also offering gym memberships, subsidised travel and financial advice. Last year, employers including Amazon, Ocado and Tesco offered signing-on bonuses worth thousands of pounds before the Christmas rush. Figures from Indeed show signing-on bonuses rising particularly sharply in social care, a sector where employers might struggle to pay a permanently higher wage bill. However, union leaders have warned that bonuses, which do not usually count towards a worker’s pension, typically fail to make up for lower pay, following a decade of stagnating average wage growth and a squeeze on UK living standards.",News/Business,How to attract staff as inflation soars?
