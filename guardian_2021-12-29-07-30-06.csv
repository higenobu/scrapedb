12/29/2021,"Thomas Tuchel has said he will not stop standing up for his Chelsea players after conceding he has “zero per cent” understanding as to why the Premier League is set to muddle through a chaotic winter with only three substitutes and suggested “everybody is refusing” to consider a return to five permitted changes. Before Chelsea host Brighton on Wednesday, Tuchel questioned that logic and said players require protection from the league. The Chelsea manager reiterated he has no problem with the congested schedule but said he is baffled at the reluctance to reintroduce five substitutes, which were permitted at the height of the pandemic. “I absolutely cannot understand, zero per cent, why we are the only league who plays through winter and we are the only league with three substitutes in a period of heavy, heavy Covid threat and situations,” Tuchel said.  “It makes absolutely no sense. It is the [current] situation and that is worrying. The schedule is not the problem. We love the schedule. Five changes were invented [permitted] in the UK when corona first started. Now we are in the middle of it, I get the feeling that everybody is refusing it or refusing to think about it. “For me, it is only logical to do this because Covid affects everybody and you simply need more possibilities to protect the players and share the minutes. This is my opinion and I will not stop standing up for it.” Tuchel revealed on Boxing Day that three of his squad who are fully vaccinated, as well as unvaccinated players, have contracted Covid. The German said Ruben Loftus-Cheek is injured but among the players who have tested positive. Romelu Lukaku and Callum Hudson-Odoi exceeded the game-time recommended by medical staff and physios in victory at Aston Villa but N’Golo Kanté was withdrawn after a recurrence of a knee injury, prompting Tuchel to give the example of being one positive test away from a midfield crisis. “If you just speak about central midfield, Let’s assume that maybe N’Golo is out, maybe Ruben is still out; so one [positive] test in central midfield is enough for everything to collapse again because then Kova [Mateo Kovačić] will again play 90 minutes from where? Out of nothing,” the manager said. “You risk injuries – that is what we are doing at the moment. I cannot say more and I cannot see how we are out of Covid threat at the moment.” Brighton travel to Stamford Bridge with a spring in their step following a first league win in 12 matches against Brentford and Tuchel admitted he is a fan of Graham Potter’s side. “I like them a lot,” he said. “I think it is a great club and a great coach. It is a great approach, how they play the game. When you switch on the TV and watch them, you clearly see an idea of how they want to play. They are a tough side to beat. “I know they [have] struggled a bit with the results but I think they deserve in general a bit more than they have.. They create much more than they have actually on points.”",Sport/Football,Tuchel says substitutions not schedule is main Premier League problem,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/28/tuchel-says-substitutions-not-schedule-is-main-premier-league-problem
12/29/2021,"For the second time in 72 hours, Manchester City could enjoy the result in a Leicester game. The side with most to celebrate, however, were Leicester themselves. In adversity, short of players or time to prepare, fielding a makeshift defence, fresh from a hammering, they contrived to inflict just Liverpool’s second league defeat since March. City could be 12 points clear before Liverpool play again and Jürgen Klopp could rue the rarity of a spurned penalty by Mohamed Salah and an egregious miss by Sadio Mané. For Brendan Rodgers, however, there was vindication the moment Ademola Lookman, the substitute he only introduced two minutes earlier, struck. It required an outstanding performance from Kasper Schmeichel, but Leicester secured the finest result of their decidedly mixed campaign.  Rodgers had deemed the schedule “ridiculous” but was still able to make five changes. Some of the culprits in the 6-3 thrashing at Manchester City were demoted, the pack reshuffled and a diamond midfield selected. Even with Youri Tielemans rested, he still named five players who are central midfielders by trade. Wilfred Ndidi, deemed unfit to feature at Manchester City, lined up in defence, Jannik Vestergaard dropped even as Leicester’s three best centre-backs were all sidelined. Ndidi and Daniel Amartey were instead charged with stopping Liverpool and Rodgers’ faith in the defensive midfielder to do a defender’s job seemed misplaced when Leicester, who conceded two penalties at the Etihad on Sunday, gave away a third in as many days. A clumsy Ndidi kept stretching until he tripped Salah. The Egyptian had not missed a Premier League penalty since 2017, but he passed up a hat-trick of opportunities to put Liverpool ahead. Schmeichel parried the penalty back to Salah, whose header looped on to the bar. That also rebounded to him but he couldn’t connect cleanly. While that put Schmeichel in a select band with Huddersfield’s Jonas Lössl, the only other goalkeeper to save a Salah penalty in the Premier League, he had little time to bask in the achievement. He denied the Egyptian again, arguably with a finer save, when he tipped a rising effort over. Before that, he had to react smartly to prevent Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s cross from creeping in when Jordan Henderson had attempted to apply a finishing touch. Liverpool had assumed the initiative, but Leicester possessed a counterattacking threat. Unsurprisingly, it revolved around Jamie Vardy. The scorer of two first-half goals against Liverpool in last week’s Carabao Cup tie could have repeated the feat. His first opportunity was snuffed out in unflustered fashion by Virgil van Dijk. Joël Matip then had to produce a last-ditch intervention to block a Vardy shot. The veteran turned provider on a third swift break, darting past Kostas Tsimikas and sliding in James Maddison. Trent Alexander-Arnold retreated to hack his shot off the line. Nevertheless, Leicester, 4-0 down at half-time on Sunday, could savour the sensation of parity at the break here. The scoreline was a sign Leicester had become better organised. As Rodgers sought to congest the centre of the pitch, it meant the space was on the flanks. Tsimikas was able to advance unopposed a couple of times, though Liverpool missed the dynamism the suspended Andy Robertson would have offered and there were times when his understudy struggled to provide the final ball. If Liverpool looked more reliant on the right-sided trio of Alexander-Arnold, Henderson and Salah to provide a threat, it also reflected the drop in Mané’s form. The Senegalese had a glorious chance to score a first goal in nine games but spurned it. Sent clear by Diogo Jota, he angled his run to evade Timothy Castagne but blazed his shot over the bar. The importance of the miss was soon apparent. Rodgers made a double change, summoning Lookman and Tielemans. The former Everton winger Lookman scored on Sunday and did so again here, collecting the ball on the halfway line, exchanging passes with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and racing forward to beat Alisson. Klopp brought on Roberto Firmino, putting all four of his main forwards on the pitch at the same time. Leicester concentrated still more on defence, leaving Vardy alone in attack as Marc Albrighton was introduced to make it a back five while Liverpool set up camp in their territory. They scarcely troubled Leicester in the 20 minutes after Lookman struck as they looked disjointed. Then Salah hooked a volley wide of Schmeichel’s goal. Jota came closer with a header from Alexander-Arnold’s corner. Van Dijk drilled a low effort that Schmeichel repelled at his near post. The pressure felt unrelenting but Leicester were defiant as they held on. They deserved to.",Sport/Football,Ademola Lookman steals in to give depleted Leicester win over Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/28/leicester-liverpool-premier-league-match-report
12/29/2021,"Valentina Orellana-Peralta, 14, came to Los Angeles from her native Chile earlier this year. She dreamed of becoming an American citizen and an engineer, and looked forward to seeing LeBron James play basketball in person. But her life was cut short two days before Christmas, when a Los Angeles police officer opened fire at a man inside a department store, and in the process fatally shot the young girl.  Orellana-Peralta’s shellshocked parents, and their attorneys, including civil rights lawyer Benjamin Crump, gathered outside the LAPD headquarters in downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday morning to share stories of their “sweet angel” who died before she could open her Christmas gifts. “It is like my whole heart has been ripped out of my body,” said Juan Pablo Orellana Larenas, Valentina’s father, who spoke in Spanish, with his lawyers translating. He arrived from Chile over the weekend after his daughter was killed. He held in his hand a skateboard, still in its plastic wrapping, that arrived for Valentina on Christmas Eve, the day after she died. He said he would deliver the board and other Christmas gifts to her grave. When he spoke to his daughter the day before she was killed, she told her father how excited she was to pass her physics and math exams and how she hoped the two of them could go to a Lakers game in the new year when he arrived to LA. Valentina’s father showing a skateboard that arrived for his daughter on December 24, the day after she died. He says he will now leave the skateboard at her grave. pic.twitter.com/5ZlFZFgrjX The parents’ cries for justice, in front of a dozens of cameras outside LAPD, came one day after the department released body-camera footage and surveillance video of the incident last Thursday in which an officer shot and killed Valentina in a Burlington Coat Factory store in North Hollywood while firing at another person. Valentina had been shopping for a Christmas dress with her mother when the officer fatally shot her. Police said the officer’s bullet bounced off the floor and into the store dressing room, and the LA coroner ruled the death a homicide, saying the girl was hit in the chest. Valentina died on the scene. The man shot by the officer was Daniel Elena Lopez, who had assaulted several customers with a bike lock, and was also pronounced dead at the store. The officer is on paid leave, according to LAPD, who have not identified him. The police video showed that Elena Lopez, 24, was standing away from the officer, at the opposite end of a store aisle, and appeared to be turning away when the officer fired three bullets in rapid succession. The distraught parents, who could barely get through their remarks at a packed press conference, said that Valentina came to LA with her mother roughly six months ago and had excelled at her high school, High Tech Los Angeles in Van Nuys, despite English being her second language. She was interested in building robots and dreamed of going to college and having a career in engineering or technology “to make the world a better place”, said Crump, the attorney who has represented the family of George Floyd and other high-profile victims of police violence. “Her most important dream was to become an American citizen. They came to America from Chile to get away from violence and to have a better life.” The girl’s aunt told the LA Times earlier this week that she grew up in Macul, a working-class neighborhood in Santiago, the capital of Chile. At the news conference, Valentina’s mother, Soledad Peralta, described a horrifying scene at the Burlington store. They were Christmas shopping, and Valentina was trying on dresses when they heard a commotion and screams in the store. Valentina locked the door of the dressing room, her mother said in a statement translated by her lawyers: “Valentina and I hugged each other … and started praying, praying for peace, praying for safety, praying for everybody.” The gunshot that hit Valentina felt like an “explosion” that knocked them both to the floor. She didn’t initially realize her daughter had been shot, and Valentina quickly went limp, she said. “She died in my arms and there was nothing I could do … She didn’t wake up,” she said. “As I lay screaming for help, the police did not come to help me or my daughter. But I kept screaming. When the police finally came, they took me out of the dressing room, and left my daughter laying there. I wanted them to help her. But they just left her laying there alone.” LAPD declined to answer questions on Tuesday about whether officers or paramedics provided any medical aid to Valentina. “She was full of joy and she had big dreams for her future. She had a lot of life to live,” Soledad Peralta said. “Valentina meant the world to us, to our family, to her friends and to her schoolmates. And now our sweet angel has left forever. Please give us strength, Valentina, to make justice for you.” The parents want Valentina to be remembered as a student who dreamed of becoming an American citizen, who excelled in school in LA despite English being her second language, who dreamed of being an engineer, going to college, and going to a Lakers game with her father. pic.twitter.com/Tkb4PISq4b Juan Pablo Orellana Larenas said when he spoke to his daughter on the phone the day before she died, the two said they would celebrate her achievements in school when he arrived to LA: “She wanted to be here in the United States because this is the land of opportunity.” The father said he hadn’t slept since he learned a police officer killed his daughter last week. The parents were surrounded by supporters and activists protesting LAPD, some calling for the officer to face charges, and others calling for LAPD to be defunded. Crump and the other attorneys said they were urging the department to be transparent and to preserve records, and said their investigation was ongoing. The videos released on Monday fueled further national outrage. Despite police’s initial claims that officers had been responding to an “assault with a deadly weapon” and a “possible shooting in progress”, Elena Lopez did not have a gun, and the video shows his hands were visible the moment he was shot. An officer’s body camera footage showed that as soon as the officer made it to the store aisle where Elena Lopez was standing and saw the man for the first time, he immediately fired, without appearing to issue any commands. LAPD killings have sharply increased this year – the department has fatally shot 18 people in 2021, compared with seven in 2020, according to the LA Times. The California attorney general is investigating the killing, and LAPD said its investigation into the Burlington killings was ongoing and have declined to answer questions.",News/US news,"‘She had big dreams’: parents of Valentina Orellana-Peralta, teen killed by LAPD, speak out",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/28/valentina-orellana-peralta-teen-killed-lapd-burlington
