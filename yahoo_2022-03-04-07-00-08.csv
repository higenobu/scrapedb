3/4/2022,"As the United States increasingly goes after some of the Kremlin’s business tentacles, the latest person arrested for violating U.S. sanctions against Russia is less notable for his ties to Vladimir Putin than his old ties to Sean Hannity—he is a former Fox News producer who left to launch a Russian propaganda network. The Department of Justice on Thursday revealed that Jack Hanick was quietly arrested in London on Feb. 3 for dodging U.S. sanctions by helping a sanctioned Russian oligarch, Konstantin Malofeyev, start his right-wing Tsargrad TV. The DOJ simultaneously unsealed a grand jury indictment against him, accusing Hanick of knowingly engaging in business dealings with Malofeyev, who had been formally sanctioned by the U.S. government for his role in financing Russia-backed soldiers in eastern Ukraine who have violently tried to break off from the democratic country since 2014. Sean Hannity’s Ukraine War ‘Plans’ Are Even Dumber Than You Think The indictment also accuses Hanick of lying to FBI agents about his travels to Greece and Bulgaria to expand the TV network in 2015 and 2016, when he was interviewed by American investigators last year in New York City. Federal agents assert that many of the damning details about Hanick’s Kremlin adventures were laid out in an unpublished memoir he kept in his email account, which was searched by the feds with a court-approved search warrant. Malofeyev was sanctioned in December 2014 by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control for financing separatists in the Donbas region in southeastern Ukraine. Russia-aligned fighters there operated with the not-so-secret help of that country's military and used that government’s weapons when they shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, killing 283 passengers and 15 crewmembers. Malofeyev (also spelled in the West as Malofeev) started an Orthodox Christian network called Tsargrad TV. In 2020, he launched a similarly named right-wing political group in Russia with an imperialist bent that would—much like the National Rifle Association does in the United States—pressure politicians to toe the conservative line. I’m a Former Russian TV Anchor. Fox News Mimics State TV. According to The Warsaw Institute, a Polish-based geopolitical think tank, “Tsargrad” would test political candidates’ adherence to “traditional family, religious, and cultural values of the Russian people.” The Financial Times in 2015 analyzed how Malofeyev launched his “conservative yet modern spin on global news” in an attempt to mimic the rise of Fox News. Then, in 2018, the online news site Salon called out Hanick for joining the Russian operation, noting that he had previously served as Hannity’s director at Fox News. Hanick got his start at Fox News when it first launched in 1996. Fifteen years later, in 2011, he left. Three years later, he joined forces with Malofeyev’s Russian propaganda operation. The Justice Department now wants to extradite him from the United Kingdom to New York City. Damian Williams, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, issued a statement noting that sanctions “prohibit United States citizens from working for or doing business with Malofeyev but as alleged, Hanick violated those sanctions by working directly for Malofeyev on multiple television projects over the course of several years.” Williams noted the indictment underscores his office’s “commitment to the enforcement of laws intended to hamstring those who would use their wealth to undermine fundamental democratic processes. This Office will continue to be a leader in the Justice Department’s work to hold accountable actors who would support flagrant and unjustified acts of war.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/4/2022,"Ukrainian civilians blocked the road to Europe's largest nuclear power plant as Russians advanced. Drone footage shared by the mayor of Enerhodar shows hundreds of people and a barricaded road. An official from Ukraine's interior ministry pleaded with Russia to avoid shelling near the site. Ukrainian civilians blocked the road in a huge crowd to deny the Russian military access to Europe's largest nuclear power plant. Drone footage shared Wednesday by the mayor of Enerhodar, Dmitro Orlov, showed hundreds of people on a long stretch of road, some behind barricades of sandbags and tires, and some waving Ukrainian flags. Enerhodar is home to Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. It is in the southeast of the country, where Russian forces have made their most successful advances. The International Atomic Energy Agency said Wednesday that Russia claimed in a March 1 letter to be in control of the region around the plant. Earlier that day, Ukrainian officials had said that the facilities themselves remained in Ukrainian hands, the IAEA said. According to Orlov's Telegram posts, local civilians created a barricade on the route to their city, and the plant. ""This is how Enerhodar — its civilians — women and men, defend their city,"" Orlov wrote Wednesday. The scene is one of many striking examples of unarmed Ukrainians standing up to Russian advances across the country. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, reposted an image from the video on Thursday. After the confrontation, Russian soldiers and representatives of the plant met on Wednesday for negotiations, Orlov said. After that, he asked residents of the city to return home, but early on Thursday asked them to be ready to block the road again, saying that a column of military vehicles was again approaching. —Mia Jankowicz (@miajankowicz) March 3, 2022 Concerns for Ukraine's nuclear properties were heightened on February 25 when Russian forces captured Chernobyl, the infamous site of nuclear disaster. After the capture, Ukrainian officials said that radiation levels from the site were increasing. Nuclear experts later told Insider's Aria Bendix that the danger is low as the site had already been largely decontaminated. Enerhodar, however, is an active plant. Anton Geraschenko, an advisor to Ukraine's Interior Ministry, framed the risk in a Facebook post Wednesday as putting Europe ""on the brink of a NUCLEAR DISASTER!"" On February 26, an official from Ukraine's interior ministry told Reuters that Russian forces had aimed rockets at the site. Speaking of potential shelling, Geraschenko wrote in his post: ""They will not be able to penetrate the concrete shell of the reactor, but they will surely damage transformers, turbines and other equipment necessary for the safety of the nuclear power plant. ""An accident may occur as at the Chernobyl NPP [nuclear power plant] or Fukushima NPP.""

3/4/2022,"After searching more than 2,500 miles of the bottom of Lake Superior, the Atlanta — a 172-foot schooner-barge that sank during a terrible storm — has been found, preserved in the icy water just as it was when it went down more than 130 years ago. Even the gold letters of the ship's nameplate are still visible. ""It is truly ornate and still beautiful,"" Bruce Lynn, executive director of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society, said. ""It is rare that we find a shipwreck that so clearly announces what it is and the nameboard of the Atlanta really stands out."" The discovery, which the society announced this week, solves another mystery of what happened to hundreds of vessels swallowed by the lake and offers historians a window into the past. The shipwreck is sitting 650 feet below Lake Superior's surface, about 35 miles away from Deer Park in Luce County in the Upper Peninsula. In that depth, which is beyond what a human diver and sunlight can reach, the water is in the low to mid-30s, a temperature that preserves shipwrecks. It gives you a sense of what it was like to travel on the Great Lakes during dangerous conditions, before the Coast Guard and modern technology to predict the weather, communicate with others and navigate. And society spokesman Corey Adkins said the discovery may also give descendants of the crew that didn't survive some peace. ""Many people out there think the Edmund Fitzgerald is the only shipwreck on the lakes,"" he said. ""While that's an important shipwreck on the lake — 29 men lost their lives on it — five people lost their lives on the Atlanta."" More: Mariners' Church in Detroit to hold annual service for Edmund Fitzgerald shipwreck More: 3 shipwrecks discovered in Lake Superior near Grand Marais after more than 100 years ""Their stories,"" he added, ""don't deserve, for lack of a better term, to get washed away."" There are more than 6,000 Great Lakes shipwrecks, which have taken the lives of 30,000 mariners, according to the society. Of those, there are about 550 wrecks — most of which are undiscovered — in Lake Superior. The society also has a shipwreck museum at Whitefish Point. To find the shipwreck, more than 2,500 miles of Lake Superior were mapped by the society last summer with Marine Sonic Technology using side-scan sonar, a sonar system for detecting and imaging objects on the seafloor. Multiple sonar sensors — called a transducer array — send and receive acoustic pulses that help map the lake floor and detect objects. In this case, it detected the Atlanta. Records show the ship sank on May 4, 1891. Its home port was Port Huron, and it was bound with a load of coal in tow of the steamer Wilhelm when both vessels got caught in a northwest gale. In the storm, the towline winch snapped. The crew took to the lifeboat. They pulled at the oars for hours and eventually came within site of the Crisp Point Life-Saving Station. But, while attempting to land, the boat overturned — twice — and only two men made it safely to the beach. The survivors said all three masts broke off during the storm, and video from a remote operated vehicle confirmed that account. All three masts broke off flush with the deck and the hull is starting to split. ""It was tough out there for them,"" Adkins said. ""It anyone is seeing this, reading this, and you are one of the family members — a great- and great-great grandchild of the crew — contact us.""
