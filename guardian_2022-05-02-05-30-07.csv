5/2/2022,"Midway through the first half of an utterly forgettable London derby, Nuno Tavares picked up the ball near the halfway line and set off on an adventure. Suddenly, it seemed something special was happening. A brief surge of energy went round the ground. Then Tavares ran out of steam, realised that he had no idea what to do next and basically let the ball run away from his feet. Still, on he went, Arsenal’s second-choice left-back a blur of yellow as he continued to run in a straight line, his momentum taking him all the way into West Ham’s area and giving him an excellent view of Lukasz Fabianski booting the ball away. At which point it became clear that a gaping hole had appeared on the Arsenal left. Nothing came from it but it was a problem for Mikel Arteta’s team. West Ham were repeatedly finding space down that flank, repeatedly running through the same passing sequences to send Vladimir Coufal away, and it was not much of a surprise that Tavares was caught out eventually, the Portuguese’s positioning all over the place when Jarrod Bowen cancelled out Arsenal’s lead on the stroke of half-time. At least it made little difference to the final outcome. This was not a memorable display from Arsenal, who played in a daze at times and occasionally seemed intent on handing the initiative to Tottenham in the race to finish fourth, but it was enough for Arteta. “In England you say win ugly,” Arsenal’s manager said. “But I am extremely happy to see a team win ugly.” Arteta had a point. There is a hardier feel to this version of Arsenal: goals from set-pieces, more sturdiness, an unashamed willingness to run down the clock. Whisper it, but are they growing up? Is Arteta actually José Mourinho in disguise? Is he soon to be found hiding in a laundry basket on a big Champions League night at the Emirates? There is certainly something about Arsenal that rubs opponents up the wrong way. Towards the end, as Arsenal protected their 2-1 lead at an increasingly irate London Stadium, West Ham seemed to snap. Arsenal had made it bitty. Eddie Nketiah, who had a lively game up front, had suddenly transformed into Diego Costa and was doing his very best to get a rise out of Aaron Cresswell. Equally there were moments to remind Arteta that Arsenal are not the finished article. The lack of urgency was a concern given that West Ham’s focus was on their Europa League semi-final against Eintracht Frankfurt. The game drifted and it was a long time before Arsenal managed to create anything against a defence made up of three full-backs and an underpowered Kurt Zouma. Perhaps it is an inevitability of Arsenal’s youth; their most exciting forwards, Nketiah, Bukayo Saka, Martin Ødegaard, Gabriel Martinelli and Emile Smith Rowe, are young and are going to have the odd off day. Yet Arsenal cannot afford to be inconsistent now. They have to be more assertive in the final third and, at the other end, they need to stop teams targeting Tavares, who always seems to be no more than a second away from doing something utterly disastrous in defence. With Kieran Tierney out for the season, Tavares is a worry for Arteta. When Tottenham watch this game they will know where to attack Arsenal in next week’s pivotal north London derby. Antonio Conte’s instructions to Dejan Kulusevski will be simple: get the ball to Harry Kane, wait for him to turn and be ready to run when the striker knocks a pass into space down the right flank. It is an obvious point of weakness in Arsenal’s set-up; the one area where they have not lost their maverick tendencies. Everybody knows that Tavares is vulnerable. He was hooked during the first half against Nottingham Forest in January, substituted early against Crystal Palace last month and was very fortunate only to give away one penalty against Manchester United last weekend, while against West Ham he spent large portions of the game simply knocking easy passes straight out of play, needlessly putting his team under pressure. This is a player who is not comfortable with his defensive duties. So it proved when West Ham cancelled out Rob Holding’s headed goal. Declan Rice switched play, Tavares was too far infield and Coufal knocked the ball down to Bowen, whose deflected shot beat Aaron Ramsdale. It must be a concern for Arteta, particularly as the excellent Takehiro Tomiyasu limped off on his first start since January. Tomiyasu is the opposite of Tavares: steady, imposing, dependable. The Japanese right‑back kept Saïd Benrahma quiet throughout and losing him for the run-in would be a huge blow. All the same Arsenal still found a way here, taking advantage of West Ham’s lack of height through set-piece goals from Holding and Gabriel Magalhães. And to give him his due Tavares was still surging at the end, winning a crucial header in his area before starting a counterattack. In many ways he was the most entertaining player on the pitch. Arteta, though, could have done with more calm.",Sport/Football,Arsenal happy to win ugly but they must stop teams targeting Tavares | Jacob Steinberg,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/01/arsenal-happy-to-win-ugly-but-they-must-stop-teams-targeting-tavares
5/2/2022,"Jacob Zuma has been accused of systematic and “unlawful” efforts to give business allies control of billions of dollars worth of state assets, by the judge charged with investigating wrongdoing during the former president’s years in power in South Africa. Raymond Zondo, who was appointed in 2018 to lead an inquiry into allegations of systematic corruption under Zuma’s rule, handed his latest report to the current president, Cyril Ramaphosa, on Friday. The 1,000-page document accuses businessmen brothers Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta of being the beneficiaries of Zuma’s efforts to fire competent officials, intervene in management decisions, appoint compliant ministers and influence the award of contracts worth huge sums. Zondo said that the Guptas, who came to South Africa from India in the 1990s and built a sprawling commercial empire, had identified Zuma as someone “whose character was such that [the Guptas] could use him against the people of South Africa, his own country and his own government to advance their own business interests”. Zuma won power in 2009. A populist who was expected to reconnect the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party to increasingly disillusioned voters, he was forced out nine years later amid growing public anger at economic failures and a series of graft scandals. He is on medical parole while serving a 15-month prison sentence after his conviction last year of contempt of court for defying a constitutional court order to testify before Zondo’s inquiry. Zuma was jailed for contempt in July last year, a move which set off days of rioting in the KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces in which shops, warehouses and factories were looted and many burned. More than 300 people died in the unrest, the worst in South Africa since the end of the repressive, racist apartheid regime in 1994. ANC officials loyal to Ramaphosa described the violence as “political sabotage” and a potential attempt at a coup d’etat. After three months behind bars, the 79-year-old politician was released on medical parole for an undisclosed health condition. A subsequent court judgment ruled the medical parole was invalid, but his lawyers are appealing that judgment. Zuma and the Gupta brothers, who left South Africa after Zuma’s fall from power and are believed to be in Dubai, deny wrongdoing. They have previously said the allegations against them are politically motivated. The commission has interviewed hundreds of witnesses, viewed tens of thousands of files and obtained phone records among other evidence. The latest report also found that ministers and other officials knew of alleged efforts to steal vast sums from Eskom, the state power utility. Other scandals involve the national airline, which no longer flies, and a series of other state-owned companies. The charges of wrongdoing related to Eskom are particularly sensitive in South Africa, and will cause new problems for the ANC party, in power for 28 years. Chronic lack of maintenance, underinvestment and management failures have left Eskom unable to supply sufficient power to South Africa, resulting in frequent nationwide power cuts that have cut economic growth and hampered recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. In the report, Zondo asked why the ANC government had not acted to prevent the alleged corruption. “Were they aware of everything but lacked the courage to stop President Zuma and his friends, the Guptas, in what they were doing? Were they looking the other way?” the judge wrote. “The ANC and the ANC government should be ashamed that this happened under their watch.” Ramaphosa was deputy president from 2014 but the report will harm his enemies and rivals within the ANC more than it damages his own reputation. Analysts say the former union leader and business tycoon has a good chance of winning a second term at polls in 2024. A separate corruption trial of Zuma has been postponed again on Monday pending the outcome of the former leader’s appeal to get the state prosecutor removed from his case. The delay is the latest of many as it has been nearly 17 years since Zuma was first charged with corruption, fraud and money laundering related to South Africa’s controversial 1999 arms deal. He is charged alongside French arms manufacturer Thales, which is accused of paying bribes to Zuma through his former financial adviser Schabir Shaik, who was convicted on corruption charges in 2005. South Africa’s National Prosecuting Authority has accused Zuma of delaying tactics to prevent the start of the trial. While Zuma has publicly said he wants his day in court, he has over the years launched numerous legal actions that have delayed the start of the trial.",News/World news,"Jacob Zuma sought to hand state assets to allies, finds corruption report",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/01/jacob-zuma-sought-to-hand-state-assets-to-business-allies-finds-corruption-report
