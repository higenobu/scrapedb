2/21/2022,"Acontradiction sits at the heart of the British education system, and most particularly the English one. This has been the case since most secondary schools in England switched from a selective system to a comprehensive one in the 1960s. The contradiction is that the mixed-ability principle was never extended to higher education, which continues to be highly stratified. Entry to a handful of elite institutions remains the ultimate prize. As schools policy sought to create a less divided society, in which people from different backgrounds were expected to mix, universities (and the policymakers overseeing them) have clung to hierarchies. Admissions data over decades has shown these to be social as well as intellectual, with the more affluent claiming a disproportionate share of places. The development of a new cadre of super-selective state sixth forms, which the government has promised to accelerate as part of its levelling up strategy, is designed to address this. Comprehensives struggle to compete with the hothouse conditions of independent and grammar schools, some of which have links to Oxbridge dating back centuries. A few academically elite sixth forms have had striking successes.  If the aim is to boost the chances of a handful of underprivileged teenagers getting their hands on one of these golden tickets, teaching them in a highly competitive environment might seem to make sense. The problem is that the purpose of post-16 education is much broader than this. We need a system that benefits society overall, including by putting more resources behind improved vocational options, as advocated by the three-year-old Augar review. The worrying signs are that the trend towards increased selection at 16 will magnify the damaging tendency to concentrate too much on a few, while ignoring the rest. While around 85% of 17-year-olds in England are in full-time education, fewer than half of 16- to 18-year-olds do A-levels. The further education sector is currently battling to save BTecs, whose replacement with T-levels has been delayed. Of course, competition is part of life, which young people must learn to cope with. The brightest sixth-formers in poor areas have every right to aim high. But increased selection brings defeats as well as successes. And there are good reasons to defer painful experiences of rejection (the impact of failing the 11-plus was one reason why comprehensives replaced grammars in the first place). This is all the more pressing given extremely worrying evidence about young people’s declining mental health. Education, and particularly skills and training, is crucial to any inequality-reducing strategy. Age 16 (when most pupils sit GCSEs) is a crucial staging post. But there is no evidence that dividing students up at this point results in higher attainment. Strong results posted by selective sixth forms may simply show that they have successfully creamed off the most capable and determined members of a cohort. The levelling up agenda promised by the Tories should have led them straight to colleges, which were particularly hard-hit by austerity, and also to the underresourced careers service. But instead of investing in local institutions, developing their links with employers and improving their offer to older learners, ministers have held out the promise of a few more ladders to top universities, at the same time as reducing access to higher education overall. Elite sixth forms are a gimmick, not an answer to the question of how to level up.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on selective sixth forms: elitism for teenagers | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/20/the-guardian-view-on-selective-sixth-forms-elitism-for-teenagers
2/21/2022,"The Home Office is investigating allegations of racist WhatsApp messages sent by immigration staff, as the contracting firm Mitie admitted that they received complaints two years ago but failed to “escalate them”. The messages by workers for Mitie, revealed by the Sunday Mirror, include derogatory references to Chinese people and the mocking of the Syrian refugee crisis.  Mitie told the newspaper: “As soon as we were made aware we commenced an investigation, which is ongoing. We have suspended those about whom complaints have been made, pending the investigation outcome.” However, Mitie later told the Guardian: “It has been brought to our attention that an allegation was previously raised but was not escalated in line with internal procedures. This is not acceptable and we are sharing details of our whistleblowing policy with all colleagues and reminding our mangers of their responsibilities to take any such allegations with the utmost seriousness.” The offensive messages were posted by Mitie staff who were members of a 120-strong WhatsApp group called “escorts meet and greet” set up in mid-2019. The group has recently been closed down. Mitie has a contract with the Home Office to do escorting and deportation work, which is thought to be worth tens of millions each year. It is understood that eight members of staff have been suspended after the WhatsApp revelations. One remark posted in the group was a comment next to a photo of a Chinese restaurant with a closed sign shortly after the first Covid lockdown in March 2020. A Mitie worker had written underneath the photo: “Closed due to slanty eyed cunts”, a reference to reports that Covid originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan. A whistleblower first raised concerns about this racist post on the WhatsApp group almost two years ago, soon after it was posted. Another photo shared on the group showed migrants in a dinghy with the caption “Where Gary Lineker’s house?” – a reference to the Match of the Day star housing a refugee. In a reference to Syrian refugees arriving by sea, a member wrote: “They can only stay if they swim all the way,” with another replying: “What, you mean from Syria?” However, part of the post also states that Syrian refugees should be allowed to stay in the UK if they are desperate enough to take such extreme measures. The shadow immigration minister, Stephen Kinnock, described the reports of racism as “sickening” and called on Mitie to launch an immediate investigation. “The Home Office must review this contract without delay as well as its own procedures and strategy,” he said. One Mitie worker said: “Things are the worst they’ve ever been with bullying and racism. People are too scared to speak out for fear of facing further bullying or being sacked.” This is not the first time Mitie has been accused of racism. A south London employment tribunal in a judgment published in June 2021 said that it was “deeply concerned” about Mitie workers having used the racist term “cotton pickers” to describe their black colleagues. However, the claim brought by a Mitie worker of Pakistani heritage, Muqaddas Zaib, based on race and disability discrimination, was rejected. Two witnesses who claimed that the term was used by some staff were found to be “credible and honest” by the tribunal. It is a derogatory reference to black enslaved people in the southern US. One of these witnesses, a black detention custody officer manager called Denise Heslop, told the court that another member of staff said to her: “You’re nothing but a cotton picker.” The Guardian has seen another Islamophobic post from a Mitie worker on a Facebook group. It was posted before Mitie took over the Home Office escorting contract but concern was raised about the post last year. In another case, Janika Frimpong spoke to the Mirror about a recording in which colleagues are heard making racist comments such as: “Black people have a smell about them.” Frimpong, who was working as a Mitie receptionist at another company, said she unintentionally left her phone recording as she left her desk at work – only to later find it had recorded an exchange between two fellow workers. Mitie sources said that an investigation into the incident had now concluded and appropriate action had been taken in line with its disciplinary policies. A Home Office spokesperson said the department’s professional standards unit was investigating the WhatsApp messages. “The Home Office is investigating the allegations relating to Mitie staff’s behaviour and conduct. Mitie will update the immigration minister next week on the steps being taken to ensure the highest standards are always met and that individuals in their care are treated with dignity and respect.” Karen Doyle from the Movement for Justice called for Mitie to be stripped of its Home Office contract: “The racism in these organisations is institutional, systemic and starts at the top. Mitie can’t be allowed to get away with a cover-up, sack a few escorts and then return to business as usual. Mitie must go.” The Mitie spokesperson said: “There is no place for racism, bullying or discrimination in our business and we encourage our colleagues to raise any concerns via our whistleblowing procedures so that we can take appropriate action. We know it can take courage to challenge unacceptable behaviour, and this is something we encourage all of our colleagues to do.",News/UK news,Home Office immigration contractor failed to investigate racist staff messages,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/20/home-office-immigration-contractor-failed-to-investigate-racist-staff-messages
2/21/2022,"Indications that Britain and the US are secretly preparing to arm resistance fighters in Ukraine in the event of an invasion should raise red flags, and not just of the Russian variety. The effectiveness and wisdom of intervening in other people’s conflicts by proxy, however vital the principle and however seemingly justified the cause, are open to serious question, as much of cold war-era history suggests.Mere mention of the word “resistance” conjures up, in some British minds at least, images of gallant bicyclists in berets, night-time airstrips lit by torches, and furtive wireless operators valiantly plotting to thwart the “Boche”. The recent film Munich: the Edge of War, in which “good” Germans conspire against “bad” ones, is a reminder that things are usually more complicated. Resistance has many faces.Tentative plans under discussion in Washington and London to supply weapons and other military equipment to Ukrainians who object to Kremlin-enforced regime change presuppose that Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, will launch the long-anticipated invasion and succeed in overthrowing Kyiv’s elected government. Neither eventuality is a given. Putin may continue indefinitely to mess with western heads. An invasion could be repelled.Yet since Joe Biden, the US president, and Boris Johnson, his little trumpet boy, seem convinced the worst will happen – the “biggest war in Europe since 1945”, in the British prime minister’s melodramatic words – it’s only logical to assume the secret talks about post-invasion strategies acquired a new urgency. Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, reportedly briefed Congress last week on plans to deliver additional lethal aid to Ukrainians.In truth, it’s not even a big secret. “In discussions with allies, senior Biden officials have made clear that the CIA (covertly) and the Pentagon (overtly) would both seek to help any Ukrainian insurgency,” the New York Times reported last month. Asked recently whether Britain would arm resistance fighters, Johnson replied: “It’s possible, I don’t want to rule this out.”Most public opinion undoubtedly sympathises with the Ukrainian citizens contemplating the destruction of their country’s independence and democracy at the point of a gun. Understandably, many people’s gut instinct would be to resist by all means possible. All the same, officially encouraging what could quickly turn into an extremely violent, long-running, possibly unwinnable struggle requires careful, calm consideration.It’s easy to agitate for a fight when someone else is doing the fighting and when it’s happening a long way away. There’s a moral issue here: if you yourself decline to bloody your hands, should you really be egging on others to do so? If that does not give pause, then think about the practical implications.By helping Ukrainian guerrillas or freedom fighters or people’s militias (the terminology alone is problematic) to kill Russian soldiers, the US and Britain would, in effect, be waging a proxy war against Russia. Russia would know this. Would it passively accept it? Or would it return fire in similarly unpleasant, asymmetrical and hybrid ways? Of course it would. Has Johnson thought about that?  Then again, western powers are pretty hopeless at fighting proxy wars via resistance groups. Think of Ronald Reagan’s disastrous Contra war in Nicaragua in the 1980s. Think of the Cuban Bay of Pigs, or how Iraq’s Shias and Kurds were urged to revolt in 1991 by George HW Bush and subsequently betrayed. Saddam Hussein slaughtered them by the thousand. Western politicians, prating about principle then as now, utterly failed them.Resistance groups can be hard to control. They travel unexpected paths. The most notorious example is Afghanistan, where some US-armed mujahideen groups fighting the post-1979 Soviet occupation went on to create the Taliban, who turned on their creators like Mary Shelley’s monster. Perhaps Johnson, unlike the former Texas congressman Charlie Wilson, who was behind the US covert mission, knows what he’s doing. Or is he, in familiar style, already making promises to Ukrainians he cannot and will not keep?Proxy wars often do more harm than good, and western powers are not their only proponents. Consider the misery inflicted upon Yemen’s desperate people by the proxy fight between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia. History is littered with examples of countries where liberators, in overthrowing oppression, became oppressors. Look at Iran, look at Angola.The contrary argument, of course, is that each case is different. Ukraine is different. And so it is, at present. But a western-backed insurgency there could easily morph into civil war, spread to the neighbouring Baltic republics and elsewhere, and become in time a head-on, undisguised, unlimited confrontation with Russia. It’s easy to see Johnson starting such a fight. Knowing him as we do, it’s hard to see him finishing it. Ukraine needs all the support it can get at this moment of enormous, looming trauma. But the best way to help – if it is generally agreed that is the right thing to do – is not to start a potentially endless dirty war of assassinations, bombings, midnight terror, disappearances, bottomless abuses, broken families and broken hearts.If Johnson and Biden truly want to make a difference – and ensure Putin backs off – they should assume the risk themselves, by offering full Nato membership to Ukraine’s government while it still has one. Don’t send out young Ukrainians to fight and die for democracy and freedom while you sit at home, declaring how terrible it all is.Stand up for what you say you believe, or pipe down.

2/21/2022,"At the end of a Winter Olympics like no other, moments before a furious barrage of fireworks tattooed the Beijing skyline, the president of the International Olympic Committee gave an extraordinarily upbeat assessment of these Games. “The Olympic spirit could only shine so brightly, because the Chinese people set the stage in such an excellent way – and in a safe way,” Thomas Bach said. “The Olympic Villages were outstanding. The venues – magnificent. The organisation – extraordinary. On behalf of the best winter sport athletes of the world, I say: Thank you, our Chinese friends!”  It had been, Bach added, a “truly exceptional” Winter Games. Exceptional? Yes. But in myriad ways: good and bad. However if there is a lasting requiem to these Games, it was soundtracked by Kirill Richter’s enchanting melody In Memoriam, the music to which the 15-year-old skater Kamila Valieva leaped and spun and performed the first quad in Olympic history during the team event. It was the Russian’s calling card to the world. Another came less than 48 hours later when she failed a drugs test for the banned heart medication TMZ. What followed was one of the most extraordinary – and desperate weeks – in Olympic history. By turns Valieva was vilified, hounded, supported, temporarily reprieved by the court of arbitration for sport, and then – with the eyes of the world on boring down on her in the individual event – her world finally fell apart. She fell twice. Departed the ice in tears. And then another twist of the knife as her coach Eteri Tutberidze lashed out at her. As a spectacle it was compelling, appalling and utterly sad. Not since Ben Johnson tested positive at the Seoul Games in 1988 has a drugs scandal so discombobulated our sensibilities; so shocked the world. This, after all, is a 15-year-old. She could never have acquired banned drugs by herself. Essentially it was cold abuse by a different name. Another tragedy: Valieva, who is widely regarded as the greatest female skater the world has seen, will probably never compete in a Winter Olympics again. Valieva wasn’t the only extraordinary story that night. The runner-up, Alexandra Trusova, performed five quads but still lost to another Russian Anna Shcherbakova. “I hate skating. I hate it. I hate this sport,” she shouted afterwards. “I will never go out on the ice again!” It made Tonya and Nancy look tame. It was the story of these Games, and then some. However Valieva’s drug case may not be settled for months, and there was huge sympathy for the US and Japan teams that came second behind the Russian Olympic Committee in the team skating. They never got to enjoy their moment on the podium in Beijing. However chatting to Max Cobb, the president and chief executive of US biathlon, reminded me over the weekend that this is not new. “Over the last three decades since I have been a part of every Olympic Winter Games, as a coach, organiser or official,” he said. “Sadly, I have witnessed more than my fair share of doping scandals and what I can say with 100% certainty is that the athletes who were cheated were the last ones the system served. “The victims were the biggest losers. Their moments of glory were stolen from them only to have scant recognition which in far too many instances came years later.” Of course there were incredible sporting moments, too. For 16 years Lindsey Jacobellis was known as the snowboarder who was miles clear of the Turin 2006 Olympics board cross final – until she fell on the penultimate jump while showing off by taking a celebratory grab of her board. At the ripe old age of 36, Jacobellis redeemed herself by winning two snowboard cross golds. There was the tragedy and bravery of Mikaela Shiffrin, who came into these Games hunting five medals but left with none – and yet still found time to speak powerfully about her loss to the media. The US figure skater Nathan Chen was extraordinary as he won Olympic gold. Norway biathlete Johannes Thingnes Boe won four gold medals as his country dominated the medal table again. But these Games will linger in the memory for other reasons, too – in particular the extraordinary closed-loop system, which meant that athletes, officials and journalists were not allowed any interaction with mainline China. Incredibly everyone at the Games also had to go daily PCR tests, and lived under the threat of being placed into a special isolation facility if they had a positive. As the speed skater Claudia Pechstein put it, when asked what her main target was for Beijing: “To be negative for Covid!” She was far from alone. But such a policy, while immensely suffocating, worked. On Sunday, Juan Antonio Samaranch, chair of the IOC Coordination Commission, said the system had worked “100%” – with 1.8 million Covid-19 tests conducted during the Games-time period with just 437 positive tests reported. And, ultimately, China will be delighted with how these Games went. After all, these were an Olympics that began under a series of shadows: with spiky questions over human rights, particularly in the western Xinjiang region – where more than a million Uyghurs are in re-education camps – and the fate of the tennis player Peng Shuai. But while these issues bubbled under, particularly when China chose the cross-country skier Dinigeer Yilamujiang to light the flame, and when the Beijing spokesman Yan Jiarong claimed that “so-called forced labour” in the region was “lies” – they never dominated the discourse. China also ended these Games third in the medal table with 27 medals including nine gold medals. They would have certainly taken that beforehand. Notably at the closing ceremony their two biggest stars, the 18-year-olds Su Yiming and Eileen Gu, walked into the stadium together for the parade. As they did so, Xi Jinping applauded in approval. And, if you looked closely, you could even detect a smile.",Sport/Sport,"A Winter Olympics that was farcical, disturbing and often exceptional",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/20/a-winter-olympics-that-was-farcical-disturbing-and-often-exceptional
2/21/2022,"With the Queen approaching her 96th birthday in April, there was always going to be concern about her contracting Covid, but the monarch has tested positive against a radically different backdrop from when the virus arrived in the UK. In addition to the protection afforded by her vaccinations – and she is understood to have had a booster – she could also be given antiviral drugs approved by UK authorities as recently as December.  While engaging in “light duties”, she will be cared for at Windsor Castle by the medical household – staff who are part of the royal household. At the forefront of decisions about her care will be the Queen’s physician, Sir Huw Thomas, who is a consultant at St Mary’s hospital in London and professor of gastrointestinal genetics at Imperial College London, as well as the head of the medical household. He may choose to prescribe one or more antivirals designed to protect the most vulnerable, a decision that potentially might have to be made within days. Despite the press and public being told that the Queen is suffering from “mild, cold-like symptoms”, experts stress that nearly all severe Covid infections can begin with mild symptoms. Prof Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert at the University of East Anglia, said that with anyone in their mid-90s, even if triple-vaccinated, there would be concerns that they could gradually deteriorate. “You would, I think, almost certainly be considering giving antiviral drugs, of which there are a number around at the moment.” Drugs that could be considered include Ronapreve, which was approved in August last year, and which contains types of proteins called monoclonal antibodies. It has been shown to reduce the risk of hospital admission or death by 70% in those with mild to moderate Covid-19. Other options are two drugs approved in the UK in the last part of last year: Molnupiravir, which clinical trials suggest reduces the risk of hospital admission or death by 30%; and Pfizer’s Paxlovid, which has been shown to be around 90% effective in preventing the need for hospital admission. There are three other drugs – Sotovimab, Remdesivir and Dexamethasone – though Hunter said that the first two would need to be given within three days for them to have the best impact. The Queen has been known for her strong constitution and infrequent ill health and as recently as June 2020 was pictured riding a Fell pony at Windsor while isolating. On Wednesday, the sovereign, standing holding a walking stick, remarked during an in-person audience: “Well, as you can see, I can’t move.” Buckingham Palace declined to comment, but the Queen was understood to have been feeling slightly stiff, rather than having injured herself or being unwell. She missed the Remembrance Sunday event at the Cenotaph on 14 November last year due to a sprained back. Before that, she attended a busy reception for business leaders at Windsor Castle on 19 October. But the next day she cancelled a trip to Northern Ireland on medical advice and was admitted to hospital for a night to undergo preliminary tests. She then spent more than three months only carrying out light duties on doctors’ orders. That hospital stay was her first in eight years. In 2013, she was treated at the private clinic for a bout of gastroenteritis, and she also stayed for one night. Nevertheless, as Age UK has noted, age is not the only characteristic that influences individual risk from Covid, which should be considered alongside other characteristics that influence risk, including sex, ethnicity, and some pre-existing medical conditions. The charity also pointed out that, during the last few months of last year, older people had remained less likely than other age groups to have coronavirus. While reiterating that there was evidence that the protection afforded by vaccines waned over time, the charity also said that protection against serious illness remained very high for at least five months, and urged the elderly to get a booster. Buckingham Palace has declined to say when the Queen received a booster, or indeed confirm if she has had one. The monarch herself expressed enthusiasm in public last year for vaccinations as she encouraged people to “think about other people rather than themselves” and get the Covid-19 jab, in a video call with health officials leading the deployment of the vaccine across the UK. “Once you’ve had the vaccine, you have a feeling of … you know, you’re protected, which is I think very important,” she said.",News/UK news,Covid antivirals an option for the Queen under care of medical household,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/20/queen-covid-antivirals-care-medical-household
2/21/2022,"The Manchester United manager, Ralf Rangnick, condemned the unsavoury scenes which led to Anthony Elanga being struck by a missile from the Leeds United stand during Sunday’s fiery contest at Elland Road, with the hosts launching an investigation into the incident. Elanga was hit by an object from the crowd in the aftermath of Fred’s goal which made it 3-2 in the visitors’ favour. Thankfully, the 19-year-old was unhurt and recovered to score United’s fourth in stoppage time and secure a vital three points on an afternoon when Rangnick’s side had earlier squandered a 2-0 half-time lead thanks to two second-half goals in two minutes from Rodrigo and Raphinha.  “As far as I know there is some investigation going on from Leeds United,” Rangnick said afterwards. “In the end, Anthony looked well and he was happy about scoring. Obviously things like that should not happen.” The incident cast a shadow over a fiercely-contested game, with no shortage of talking points throughout. Rangnick praised his side for the maturity they showed in responding to being pulled back level and eventually go on and win the game. “It was a very intense game and if you were a neutral, you could say it was entertaining,” he said. “There were only few moments when nothing happened. “At half-time we were fully aware they’d have a go at us and play with more aggression. Rodrigo didn’t intend to play the ball where he did but within two minutes, it’s 2-2. We showed maturity and showed unity on the pitch and in the end, we deserved to win.” The victory moves United four points clear of fifth-placed West Ham after the Hammers’ draw with Newcastle on Saturday, while Leeds remain firmly entrenched in the relegation battle. They remain five points clear of the bottom three but are now only the second side to concede 50 Premier League goals this season. They lost Robin Koch to a head injury during the first half, but only after the game had already been stopped due to an earlier collision which left Koch bloodied and needing treatment. When he was replaced, Leeds did not use a concussion substitute but Marcelo Bielsa appeared to suggest his withdrawal was not due to concerns over concussion. “He had a cut in his head and what excludes him is the cut. If the cut is the most significant thing than the knock he received, I acted in accordance to that.”",Sport/Football,Rangnick speaks out after Manchester United’s Elanga struck by missile,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/20/rangnick-speaks-out-after-manchester-uniteds-elanga-struck-by-missile
2/21/2022,"There may have been some raised eyebrows at the unusual England starting XI to play Spain but a gutsy and focused performance against a team laden with Barcelona’s Champions League winners earned a 0-0 draw and demonstrated there is serious depth to England’s squad looking ahead to this summer’s Euros. In front of an impressive crowd of 14,284, with rail replacement buses disrupting travel to Carrow Road and the rain lashing down, Lauren Hemp went closest for the Lionesses, smacking an effort against the post shortly after the restart on the second day of Arnold Clark Cup fixtures.  Wiegman had promised we would see “some changes” to the starting XI to face the Catalan-heavy Spain and she delivered, with nine changes to the side that put in one of the best first-half performances the Lionesses have produced in years in their 1-1 draw with Canada on Thursday. Only Rachel Daly and Alex Greenwood remained, with the former shifted from right-back to left-back as backup options for Demi Stokes on the left are explored. The successful double pivot partnership of Keira Walsh and Leah Williamson was relegated to the bench, with Manchester City’s Georgia Stanway instead operating as a single pivot in front of Greenwood and fellow centre-back Jess Carter. The England manager had said she wanted to “do a little more research” on the double pivot and try it again, but added: “We want to see other things too this week. We want to try out different players in positions and see how they connect to each other, so it’s absolutely something that we want to see again but we’ll try out some other things too.” “In football things are dynamic,” she said. “When you take a picture in a certain moment it’s two pivots, and when you take a picture of a certain other moment it might be one pivot, so we’re trying things out with other players too.” Spain had made five changes, but the heartbeat of the side, the Ballon d’Or and Fifa Best winner and Uefa player of the year, Alexia Putellas, remained with fellow Barcelona midfielders Aitana Bonmatí and Patri Guijarro. Despite the tricky trio helping Spain to dominate possession in the first half with 66% of the ball, the England triumvirate of Stanway, the Arsenal midfielder Jordan Nobbs and team veteran Jill Scott, impressed as the visiting team were limited to one shot on target. Keeping Spain at bay is no mean feat – they had scored 97 goals in their previous 17 games prior to this encounter in Norwich – but the unorthodox backline sitting in front of the debutant Hannah Hampton, whose distribution throughout was top-notch, stood firm. It is rare that you are left wondering what has to be done to Scott, a physical presence herself, for a foul to be given, but Spain were aggressive in the middle, conceding eight fouls to England’s three in the opening 45 minutes. There was an urgency and intensity to England’s play that kept them in the game but the Spaniards looked patient, happy to wait out the pressure and wait for the opening. The arrival of the direct, Norwich-produced winger Lauren Hemp in the second half almost immediately caught the visiting side off-guard though, as she shifted the ball on to her left foot 30 seconds after coming on before cracking the ball off the left-hand post with Misa Rodríguez beaten. Wiegman had given us a heads-up on the change that would come around the hour mark. With Spain in the ascendancy but Lucia García shooting poorly wide from 10 yards out in their best attempt, the excellent Stanway was shifted forward and Walsh and Williamson came on in favour of Scott and Nobbs as England attempted to maintain their intensity and solidity. England created a handful of chances during a late burst of possession late on, but they lacked an end product. At the other end, Hampton did well to stop a blistering late shot from the substitute and player of the match Athenea del Castillo.",Sport/Football,Lauren Hemp comes closest for England in absorbing goalless draw with Spain,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/20/lauren-hemp-comes-closest-for-england-in-absorbing-goalless-draw-with-spain
2/21/2022,"Martin Kettle’s thoughtful article on the future of the monarchy (16 February) ended with the phrase “a story about the kind of country we choose to be”. Am I unduly pessimistic in thinking we have very little choice? The norms of our society are set primarily by huge international technology companies and their relationship with advertising and social discourse. Our politics is conducted under systems and conventions that are no longer fit for purpose, where the House of Lords seems more representative of democracy and justice than either the Commons or the government. Not even supporters of Brexit can have chosen to bring the country to its present sorry state. And there is nothing we (the people) can do, until the powers allow us another vote. Yes, the monarchy needs changing (or for some, abolishing), but the whole structure is in desperate need of reform. The status of the monarchy, the power and structure of the executive, the powers of legislation and scrutiny of parliament, the methods of election and appointment, justice and accountability – all these and no doubt other matters need to be examined publicly and forensically in citizens’ assemblies. Then “we” can choose, and it is to be hoped that our political establishment will listen and put through parliament the bulk of our wishes, regardless of the vested interests against them.Hugh LeggeNorthampton   It is unfortunate that Simon Jenkins (Whisper it, but the time is right for the Queen to abdicate, 14 February) does not stay with his thought that the head of state being chosen by birth and religion is inherently absurd. It is also inherently undemocratic. Tom Nairn, in his work The Enchanted Glass, proposes that the “constitutional monarchy” is “both the apex and essence of the British state, the symbol of its backwardness”. It is simply not the case that the monarchy’s role is powerless and “emphatically detached from political partisanship”. The powers are real, even if not usually exercised. The recent revelations of the process of Queen’s consent further undermine the notion of being free from partisanship and independent of the political process. The removal of the crown from the constitution and an elected second house are minimum requirements for a modern and mature democracy.Nigel FlorenceMevagissey, Cornwall  It is refreshing to see Polly Toynbee argue clearly for the end of our feudal and anachronistic monarchy (Clearly Britain loses more than it gains from the monarchy. Let us be brave and end it, 17 February). The Queen is rightly admired for her lifelong service, even by many of us who advocate for a republican Britain. This is the time to do it with minimum fuss and rancour, almost a celebration of Her Majesty as Polly shrewdly recommends, before moving on to becoming a modern European state. There is no guarantee that the Queen’s successors will be like her. Electing our head of state would allow all the safeguards that Polly mentions to come into effect. Most importantly, it will pull the rug away from class-based entitlement that has bred a nation of inequality. And let’s have some meaningful honours – drop the “empire” as if it were alive and well, and something that citizens who serve their country and society should be made “members” of.Christopher TannerLlandovery, Carmarthenshire  Polly Toynbee is right. The future of the monarchy is worthy of a full-blown inquiry.

2/21/2022,"At 97, getting to sleep can be a complicated affair (Letters, 16 February). I greet my first God, Jehovah, with a little prayer, then say “hello” to Allah followed by my Hindu friend, and finally turn to Buddha before counting to 100, doing relaxation exercises. Turning from my right to left side, I start all over again. Somehow, I must sleep because I wake up in the early hours to relieve myself. And bingo, returning to bed I think back to the good days when I was 20. Getting up to shower is an effort that is manageable between 8am and 10am. And the day begins.Gabriel AitmanNorthwood, London   When I have trouble getting to sleep, or actually more often getting back to sleep after having had to go to the loo at around 3am, I have tried to develop a strategy (counting anything has never worked for me) whereby I have to use all the letters in the alphabet for lists in a particular category. Capital cities, English football clubs (I do ignore X and Z, but thank you QPR). The single-word names of pop groups (ie Abba) work, but not the Beatles. However, here’s the thing about the Beatles. I’ve tried to recall A-Z Beatles songs (here I use every word in the title) repeatedly over the years. There is no V. Maybe Lennon and McCartney knew and kept a song back? I have had to watch every second of the eight hours of Get Back through the night for clues – a hard day’s night indeed.

2/21/2022,"Sir Tim Smit’s intemperate denunciation of Cornish people as “tossers” for looking back to the good old days helps to highlight a number of things about contemporary Cornwall (Eden Project co-founder under fire for rant about Cornish people, 16 February). First, we should understand why many look back to a time before tourism and mass immigration made affording a decent home, or a home at all, beyond the reach of many Cornish people. The Cornish are now a minority in Cornwall, and are more likely to experience unemployment, low wages and poor health than non-Cornish residents.  Second, Smit’s remarks are not just offensive, they are possibly racist insofar as the Cornish are a recognised ethnic minority, a protected characteristic. Perhaps Mr Smit should look a little further into what Cornish people are doing to develop their economy, culture and language, and be supportive rather than abusive.Prof Malcolm WilliamsCardiff University  Surely Cornish folk need to lighten up a little about Tim Smit’s words.

2/21/2022,"Ukrainian officials have accused international monitors working in the conflict zone in the country’s east of succumbing to pro-Russian bias, after the mission was depleted when the US, British and Canadian governments withdrew their citizens. The mission, run by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), is made up of hundreds of unarmed monitors, often former diplomats from OSCE member states. Their armoured vehicles crisscross the territory on both sides of the lines to report ceasefire violations.  As Moscow looks ready to exploit the tense situation in the conflict zone to provide a pretext for the further invasion of Ukraine, the work of the monitors is more important than ever. However, just when they are most needed, their ability to work has been hampered by the decision by several countries to evacuate, due to the risk of a Russian invasion. “We have asked for France and Germany to increase the number of monitors they have in place, and we want the OSCE to return to working according to its mandate,” said the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereschuk, speaking on Saturday in Stanytsia Luhanska, a town in Ukrainian-controlled territory right on the frontline. Russia insists Ukraine is planning an offensive in the east. Ukraine and western countries believe Russian claims of escalation are merely a smokescreen to give it a pretext to launch a military assault. “It’s very important for everyone to understand that it’s the Russian Federation that’s behind this. Ukraine has no offensive plans,” said Vereschuk, after a visit to a kindergarten in Stanytsia Luhanska that was shelled on Thursday. Impact marks suggest the kindergarten was hit from the south, where the Russia-backed separatists have positions, but Russian media have suggested the incident could have been a setup. Although journalists were given access to the scene on Thursday and again on Saturday, in their daily report the OSCE said its staff were not permitted to approach closer than 50 metres to the school and were thus “unable to determine the weapons used or the direction of fire”. “This did not happen,” said Vereschuk. “Unfortunately, we are able to state that the OSCE special monitoring mission was not completely objective about the situation with the kindergarten.” Serhiy Haidai, the Kyiv-appointed governor of Luhansk region, went further, suggesting the departure of British, American and Canadian monitors had led to a pro-Russian bias. “Those who are left are representatives of Russia and the former Soviet countries, and they can look at things very one-sidedly. They don’t go where they know they will find proof of shelling of civilian buildings, but they are very happy to look at our military installations, and this creates a big question for us,” he told the Guardian in Stanytsia Luhanska. The mission’s 680 monitors come from more than 40 countries, and the withdrawn American, British, Canadian and Dutch delegations represent 57, 40, 28 and seven people respectively, according to a January OSCE report. The OSCE mission has long come under suspicion on both sides of the lines, though impediments to work on the separatist side have usually been more frequent and greater. “The Ukrainians were always suspicious of the Russian and Belarusian monitors, while the separatists were suspicious of Americans and Poles,” said Nikolaus von Twickel, a Berlin-based analyst who previously worked for the mission. Sources inside the OSCE mission dismissed Ukrainian claims of bias. “The idea that a change in personnel would influence the report … this just isn’t how it works. There are so many layers of checks,” said one source inside the mission, who spoke on condition of anonymity. However, there is great unease at the decision by some countries to withdraw monitors. In a video call with about 450 staff last Monday, the head of the monitoring mission, Yaşar Halit Çevik, said evacuated staff with office jobs would not be able to work remotely, according to one source who was on the call. Çevik also said that if monitors from countries that had not ordered evacuations were worried about the situation, they could take annual leave. Many staff have done so, further depleting the mission. One member of the mission described the OSCE plans for evacuation if there is a Russian escalation as “shaky at best, and still in progress”, which was a factor that led many to opt to take leave. However, among the monitors stationed in the most dangerous parts of eastern Ukraine there is a feeling that the US, British and Canadian withdrawal is an overreaction. “There is a strong opinion among colleagues that it’s a bad idea,” said one monitor, from a country that has not evacuated its citizens. “There are colleagues who served in Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq. People knew they were signing up to be sent into a war zone. And now, when the mission is more important than ever before, they are being pulled out.”",News/World news,Ukraine claims Russian bias among frontline monitors after western pull-out,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/20/ukraine-claims-russian-bias-among-frontline-monitors-after-western-pull-out
