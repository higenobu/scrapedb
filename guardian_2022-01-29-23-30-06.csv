1/29/2022,"Sergio Mattarella could be reelected as Italy’s president, ending days of a farcical parliamentary voting process that has exposed deep divisions within the country’s governing coalition. Mattarella has been asked by leaders of the ruling parties to stay on as head of state after they failed to reach agreement on a candidate who could secure broad support from the 1,009 parliamentarians and regional representatives electing the president.  The 80-year-old, who is due to end his seven-year mandate on 3 February, has repeatedly said he does not want a new term. However, he might have to succumb to the pressure, especially given that Mario Draghi, the Italian prime minister, reportedly told him on Saturday that he needs to remain in post “for the good and stability of the country”. Mattarella consistently racked up a high number of votes from parliamentarians during the first six rounds of voting and secured 387 in the seventh round on Saturday morning. Now with the explicit endorsement of the political parties and Draghi, Mattarella is expected to secure the 505 votes required to win in a second round of voting later on Saturday. “Italians do not deserve any more days of confusion,” Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League party, said. Salvini’s endorsement of Mattarella came hours after he strongly backed a woman for president. “Let’s reconfirm President Mattarella … and Draghi, and immediately get back to work this afternoon. The problems of the Italians won’t wait,” he added. Draghi, who has been widely credited with restoring political stability in Italy and, at least until now, keeping his broad coalition in line, was tipped as the frontrunner for president, but the ruling parties were reluctant to endorse him over fears his promotion would trigger early elections. Matteo Renzi, who leads the small centrist party, Italia Viva, said maintaining Mattarella as president and Draghi as prime minister was “the only way to leave Italy safe from the outlandish madness and lack of political direction”. Giuseppe Conte, leader of the Five Star Movement, the largest party in parliament, said: “The Mattarella option has found wide acceptance.” Both Mattarella and Draghi are popular among Italians. But the perception of the “status quo” in the ruling majority prevailing is “superficial reading”, especially after a week of political drama that reflected a “lack of leadership, trust and courage”, said Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of the London-based research company, Teneo. “The whole political system failed the presidential election test,” added Piccoli. “The ruling coalition emerges weaker and deeply divided.” Francesco Galietti, the founder of Policy Sonar, a Rome-based political consultancy, said: “What is clear to me is that things are no longer the same. Trust within the ruling majority, and vis à vis Draghi, is undermined. Sadly enough, infighting will continue and possibly escalate.”",News/World news,‘For the stability of Italy’: Sergio Mattarella could be reelected president,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/for-the-stability-of-italy-sergio-mattarella-could-be-reelected-president
1/29/2022,"The cameras follow her every move, close to 100 lenses all expertly trained almost singularly on the star of this show. Court-side, the photo pit is full to the brim, its occupants either sat on chairs or crouched on their haunches, each with their assigned sliver of space through which to document their protagonist. Ash Barty stands at the baseline, steals a quick glance up and over the net towards her waiting adversary, then bounces and tosses the ball. Most photographers capturing what they see work for different publications but the process is always the same: bodies lean slightly forward and eyes lock on to viewfinders. Then, they are still.  Barty serves and sets about wearing down Danielle Collins. With each chase and pivot the cameras shift, just a little but in perfect unison. She nails a winner and they stand down with a prompt pull back of the head and shake of the leg, releasing the tension until the next point. This process occurs again and again for an hour and a half. They are documenting history, shooting an Australian icon-in-waiting, and no moment can be missed. The pressure is on – and they are not the only ones inside Rod Laver Arena feeling it. Such occasions have come and gone more than once over the past 44 years. Barty herself has tried and failed. Never before, though, has she made it to the final. Now she is here, having steamrolled every opponent in her path. Everyone in the country says she is unstoppable, and she might even know she is. But the stadium lights feel even brighter than usual and the thought of her losing feels darker. Everyone, basically, is a little bit twitchy. Quite what Barty herself is thinking remains one of the great tennis mysteries. Even carrying this mighty load she reveals no emotion. Stony-faced, the 25-year-old saves an uncharacteristically shaky service game with a forehand down the line. Her shots are coming easily, freely. Her backhand slices skim so low the net feels the wind on its neck. She is up 3-2 and has a break point. Collins double faults. When Barty takes the first set the crowd cheers as if she has won the match. And surely she will; all tournament she has dealt only in eviscerations and so far this has all the ingredients of another. Barty wins the opening set to a stadium-wide standing ovation. Russell Crowe nods in approval from the front row. The Barty Vegemite T-shirt crew are out in force. Australian flags are plentiful. Between them are Aboriginal flags, a nod to the player’s heritage and the importance of this one, single opportunity. Cathy Freeman is here and knows this, almost 22 years after she managed a similarly beautiful achievement. It is Collins to serve first but the cameras point again towards a bending Barty, swivelling her racket between her hands, waiting to receive. Something is stirring in the American, a ball-striker of the highest calibre in her first major final, battling not only the world’s best player but also everybody else present. She is not on her turf but will claim it if she has to. She has Barty on the ropes in her opening service game. The local favourite is down 15-40 and needs some encouragement. The crowd give it to her. She thanks them with an ace. But then the cameras follow her back to the furthest corner, where Collins has sent her scurrying and from where she stretches for a speculative lob that practically invites the inevitable smash. Collins has her break, and then a 4-1 advantage. She flexes a biceps. If the crowd won’t pump her up she’ll do it herself. The 28-year-old is used to fighting, to overcoming illness and injury and all the pain that comes with it. Something is awry in the home camp. Is this the Australian Open curse the statisticians keep talking about? Can all these strangers in their seats do enough on their own to help exercise these demons? If only Evonne Goolagong Cawley was here. Collins needs only serve out this set and the nation will surely endure a 45th year without a trophy. An ambulance siren sounds on the street outside, a reminder that there are more important things happening in the world. But right now the world begins and ends inside Melbourne Park, and when Collins faults a voice cries from the gallery: “Oh yeeeaaaaah.” Unsavoury though it is, it sparks something in the real Barty, who re-emerges from wherever she has been. A winner whizzes down the line. Then another and another, and she has two breaks of her own. This had three sets written all over it. What is this sorcery? How is she up 5-1 up in a tie-break that was not going to happen? At the change of ends the big screen captures her walking past the trophy. The cameras would have caught that too. Still not a hint of emotion. Until there is, and Barty storms into the middle of the court and lets out every inch of the scarcely conceivable pressure so many Australian players have heaved about on this surface for too long. Mouth wide open, almost shaking. Everyone is shaking. Goosebumps appear on skin. A sea of mobile phones rise. Barty races over to the former player Casey Dellacqua, a good friend. She is sitting next to the photo pit, perfect for a close-up to put on the pages of every newspaper and history book. But the photographers did not know what was still to come. Not even Barty knew, until she saw the face of Goolagong Cawley stride out from her hiding place in the bowels of the arena and up on to the stage to present her with her trophy. Tennis and Indigenous royalty, all in one. “Hell of a surprise,” Barty says. “I do not quite know how Craig [Tiley] kept that secret. I am really glad I did not know, I think I would have been under the pump, feeling it.” For a short period she was, but this flawed final was also flawless.",Sport/Sport,Ash Barty’s sorcery helps her to survive life under the Australian lens | Emma Kemp,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/29/ash-barty-australian-open-tennis-44-years-of-history
1/29/2022," Help! I am writing from beleaguered New York City which, on top of dealing with giant rats, a nasty nor’easter, and the surreal “swagger’”of a Bitcoin-obsessed mayor, is also battling a Palinvasion. Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, has spent the past week running around the city eating at multiple fancy restaurants despite the fact that she has tested positive for Covid-19. Palin, who isn’t vaccinated and has said “it’ll be over my dead both that I’ll have to get a shot,” has now become something of a public health hazard: New Yorkers are being told to go get themselves tested if they’ve been anywhere near her. Palin, it should be said, didn’t just come to New York for the food. She’s in the city because she’s suing the New York Times for defamation. The trial was supposed to start on Monday but because of the whole being-infected-with-a-highly-contagious-virus thing it’s been pushed back until 3 February. When it gets going I’m afraid you’re going be hearing a lot more about Palin. This case, to put it in highly technical legal jargon, is kind of a big deal and has massive implications for press freedom in the US. Some quick background: in 2017 the Times published a piece that incorrectly linked an advert put out by Palin’s political action committee with a 2011 mass shooting in Arizona in which six people died and 14 were wounded – including Gabrielle Giffords, then a Democratic member of Congress. The Times was very much in the wrong here, which it quickly admitted in a correction. That wasn’t enough for Palin, who is seeking damages. (It’s not clear exactly how much, but court papers estimate $421,000 in damage to her reputation.) It’s highly unlikely that Palin will win. Thanks to a 58-year-old landmark decision called New York Times v Sullivan there is a high bar for defamation when it comes to public figures: you have to prove an outlet operated with “actual malice”. However if the case ever ends up in the supreme court there’s a not-insignificant chance that Times v Sullivan could be overruled. Two conservative supreme court judges, Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have already made it clear that they are keen to rethink the decision and make it easier to sue the media. This would be a dream come true for people like Donald Trump who, while he was running for president, said he wanted to open up libel laws so he could sue people who wrote nasty stories about him. The media should obviously be held accountable for mistakes in their reporting. However creating an environment in which news outlets are afraid to report on powerful people because they’re worried about being sued is obviously not a good thing for democracy. And Palin doesn’t need to win the actual court case against the Times to score a victory against the media and undermine press freedom. As first amendment attorney Ted Boutrous told CNN: “This lawsuit has always seemed to me to be part of a disturbing trend in recent years of high-profile political figures misusing libel suits as political stunts intended to chill speech on matters of public concern – exactly what the first amendment forbids.” Long story short here is that you should not underestimate the harm Palin is capable of causing. Palin is often treated as a figure of fun by the media; she’s caricatured as a ditzy naif. But that image of her isn’t entirely accurate. You know that famous quote that’s attributed to her? The one where she said she could see Russia from her house? One survey found that almost seven in 10 Americans think she actually said that. She didn’t. Tina Fey did in a Saturday Night Live skit. What Palin actually said was that you can actually see Russia from an island in Alaska: this is perfectly accurate. I’m not trying to defend Palin’s honour here or make her out to be some kind of rocket scientist or master political strategist. What I’m saying is that she’s not the simplistic caricature she is often portrayed to be. And while she may be in the news for running around New York with Covid, it’s worth remembering the enormous part she has played in spreading another sort of virus in America: rightwing populism. As Barack Obama has noted there is a “straight line” from Palin being announced as the vice-presidential nominee in 2008 to Trumpism. Laugh at Palin all you want but there’s nothing funny about the role she has played in shaping the divided and angry United States that exists today. This distressing story is a reminder of how safe abortions help save lives. Outlawing abortion isn’t ‘pro-life’, it’s simply anti-women. The death of Agnieszka T has ignited protests across Poland against the draconian abortion restrictions that were introduced a year ago. A fascinating story about a woman who pioneered techniques still widely used by hackers today. The fact you’ve probably never heard of her, and she’s now able to live a quiet life collecting coins, is testament to how good she was at her craft. She was never caught. Gotta hope the success of this profile on her doesn’t suddenly blow her life up. Who would have thought that ensuring babies have enough to eat might be good for them? Can’t wait for the pro-life crowd to get behind this! Yes, that’s what it’s really called. Florida wants to ban teachers from talking about things like sexuality and gender identity in school classrooms. A report from the Trevor Project found that LGBTQ+ youth who learned about LGBTQ+ people or issues in school had 23% lower odds of reporting a suicide attempt in the last year. Things in American schools are very normal and not terrifying at all. “We ask that you send a full photo in a bathing suit or similar,” the advert for the €500-a-month receptionist job read. Other requirements for the role? Be a woman under 30. The Italian labour ministry is now investigating. It would appear that nothing is sacred anymore.

1/29/2022,"In 2012, Singaporean teenager Nat Ćmiel felt withdrawn and isolated from society. Perhaps a byproduct of growing up with the internet as second nature, they became fascinated by digital intimacy rather than relationships with their real-life peers. This would lead to an EP, self-titled with Ćmiel’s artist name, yeule, after the character from beloved gaming series Final Fantasy. Over the past 10 years, yeule has been building on the eerie, exploratory electronic pop realised on that first EP, with their debut LP, Serotonin II, brimming with a yearning for human connection. Now 24 and based in London, yeule is releasing their second album, the boldly constructed Glitch Princess (the title presumably a nod to the jarring, sparking sound design present in their music).  Yeule self-describes as a cyborg, and in their sonic universe tracks judder to life machine-like, vocals, synths and textures arriving distorted from the ether, sometimes crackling and fuzzy like there’s a bad connection. It’s no coincidence that Danny L Harle, alumnus of PC Music, one the most boundary-breaking labels in recent history, is alongside yeule on production duties. Breathy, experimental music that’s unafraid to play with pitch and expectation, with delicate, disarmingly intimate lyrics embodying the pleasure and discomfort of digital life (“I like touching myself, and I like being far away from my own body”), file this under the spookier end of cyber pop. In yeule’s beguiling music, the future is now. Glitch Princess is released on 4 February on Bayonet Records",Arts/Music,One to watch: yeule,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/29/one-to-watch-yeule-glitch-princess
