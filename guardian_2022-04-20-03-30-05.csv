4/20/2022,"Marcus Smith has been told he cannot dwell on Harlequins’ agonising European exit if he and the club wish to retain their domestic Premiership crown this season. Quins are due to host the league leaders Leicester this weekend and their senior coach Tabai Matson is urging the England fly-half to shake off last weekend’s disappointment as swiftly as possible. Matson has revealed his players were so gutted about their one-point aggregate defeat against Montpellier that afternoon training this week was replaced by a light-hearted game of cricket to bolster morale. Smith was as disappointed as anyone having missed a crucial late conversion but his coaches have challenged him to bounce back immediately. “If you’re as successful a goal-kicker and game leader as him you just can’t dwell on things for too long,” Matson said. “You have to be good at bouncing back and we did have that conversation. He moves on really quickly which is an important trait for someone in his position and with the lot of responsibility we give him.” Quins are confident, though, that the 23-year-old will ultimately be the better for the experience. “I don’t think anyone who’s become world class has had an easy ride,” said Matson. “Exits like this are things to learn from. “You forget he’s played more than 100 games of Premiership rugby and all the other accolades he’s got. All those experiences are really important and what you want him to do is learn from them, whether that’s for a big Test match for England or for us in the playoffs in a couple of months, hopefully.” Matson, meanwhile, is not a great fan of the current European structure which has seen Montpellier advance to the last eight despite winning only two games in this season’s tournament. “Ultimately we won five games and they won two. It’s not sour grapes, they were better than us over the last two games so they deserved to go through. “But it does make the first part of pool play farcical if they can get two cracks at it. A team that comes first in the league plays the team that comes eighth and there’s really no advantage other than that you get to play at home in the second leg. That’s not really an advantage.” Dean Richards is set to switch to a less prominent role at Newcastle at the end of the season after 10 years as the Falcons’ director of rugby and previous stints in charge at Harlequins and Leicester. “I’ve been doing it for 25 years or so and it’s been a long haul, to be honest,” said Richards. “At the same time I’m still keen as mustard, and still enjoy the sport and the match days more than anything. If I’ve got anything to announce, I’ll tell you one day.”",Sport/Sport, Harlequins urge Marcus Smith to ‘bounce back’ from European agony,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/harlequins-urge-marcus-smith-to-bounce-back-from-european-agony
4/20/2022,"Russia has deployed up to 20,000 mercenaries from Syria, Libya and elsewhere in its new offensive in Ukraine’s Donbas region, sent into battle with no heavy equipment or armoured vehicles, according to a European official. The official said the estimates of mercenary involvement on the ground in eastern Ukraine range from 10,000 to 20,000 and that it was hard to break down that figure between Syrians, Libyans and other fighters recruited by the Russian mercenary company, the Wagner Group. “What I can tell you is that we did see some transfer from these areas, Syria and Libya, to the eastern Donbas region, and these guys are mainly used as a mass against the Ukrainian resistance,” the official said. “It’s infantry. They don’t have any heavy equipment or vehicles.” Syrian ex-soldiers have been offered monthly salaries of between $600 and $3,000, depending on rank and experience, to fight in Ukraine. Wagner is reported to have moved most of its soldiers who had been fighting in Libya to Ukraine, and last month Ukrainian military intelligence claim that Russia had made a deal with the Moscow-backed Libyan warlord, Khalifa Haftar, to send Libyan fighters. The mercenaries are being thrown into the Russian attempt to capture as much as possible of eastern Ukraine, in what western defence officials have described as a rush to have some sort of victory that Vladimir Putin can announce at the 9 May military parade in Moscow commemorating the second world war. The Kremlin is seen as having four objectives in this second phase of its war in Ukraine, the European official said: capturing the Donbas, securing a land bridge to Crimea in which the besieged city of Mariupol is key, seizing Kherson oblast to secure the supply of freshwater to Crimea, and to capture additional territory that could be used as a buffer or a bargaining chip in negotiations. Russia is still thought to have three-quarters of the armed force it began the war with in February, 76 battalion tactical groups, about 60,000 troops in all. Western officials say the Russian army faces many of the same limitations that led to its defeat in the battle for Kyiv and the north. It has logistical challenges even though the supply lines to the Donbas are shorter, and much will depend on the condition of the roads and railways. “You need to keep in mind that the Russian army is very dependent on railroads and the train network has been targeted many times by the resistance,” the European official said. Furthermore, morale in the Russian ranks is low and getting lower, the official said. “They don’t like this war because they don’t like the idea of killing people who speak Russian. They have lost many comrades in the north and they have lost the navy cruiser Moskva.” Third, the Russians still do not have guaranteed air superiority so cannot provide permanent close air support to their troops on the ground, the official said. Russian commanders are seeking to crush the last stand by Ukrainian marines in Mariupol to free up troops to push north with the aim of cutting off Ukrainian forces fighting in the Donbas, a senior US defence official told reporters on Tuesday. The official said, however, there was no inevitability about that happening, pointing out that the Ukrainian military was being replenished on a daily basis with new weaponry. US howitzers will arrive in Ukraine “very, very soon” the US official said, adding that seven planeloads of equipment, part of the $800m tranche approved last week, will begin arriving in the next 24 hours.",News/World news,"Russia pitches up to 20,000 mercenaries into battle for Ukraine’s Donbas region",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/russia-deployed-20000-mercenaries-ukraine-donbas-region
4/20/2022,"One of the UK’s biggest police forces has historically failed children and was “borderline incompetent” in the way it previously dealt with organised grooming gangs, its current chief constable has said. Stephen Watson, head of Greater Manchester police, last week apologised in person to three women who were victims of gangs in Rochdale more than 10 years ago. It came with “substantial” damages and after a long, attritional campaign to get the force to admit failures. On Tuesday Watson, speaking to BBC Radio Manchester, said: “The bottom line is we’ve failed children in the past, we simply did, there’s no beating around the bush. “I don’t think people did it out of a sense of badness, I don’t think people did it because they were incompetent. But I think organisationally we were borderline incompetent in the sense that we just didn’t do things then that we absolutely do now.” The Rochdale case prompted a national debate. Concerns about the grooming and sex trafficking of predominately white working-class girls by predominately Asian men began to be raised in the early 2000s but it was not until 2012 that anyone was brought to justice. Two of the three women who last week received apologies were repeatedly treated as criminals, rather than being seen as victims in need of protection. One still has a criminal conviction that she will have to disclose when applying for certain jobs. Watson said the force “parked” an element of professional curiosity. He said when he was a young police officer there were things done then that would not be done now. If a missing child was found with an adult, the focus was on recovering the child, whereas now the adult would, “as night follows day”, be locked up. He also said child sexual exploitation sometimes results in “very unfortunate behaviours” from victims. “It messes up young people.” In the past “people didn’t see past the behaviour, as opposed to questioning, ‘why on earth is this youngster finding themselves in this position, in this situation?’ And that’s what I mean by a professional curiosity,” he said. Watson was appointed in 2021 to lead a force that was widely seen as having lost its way. It was placed in special measures in 2020 after inspectors expressed “serious cause for concern” when the force failed to record a fifth of all reported crimes. The apology only came after what Kate Ellis, a solicitor with the Centre for Women’s Justice, described as a protracted battle. “It really felt for a long time that it was a war of attrition,” she said. Proceedings on behalf of the Rochdale women against the Crown Prosecution Service are ongoing.",News/UK news,"Greater Manchester police ‘failed children in the past’, says chief constable",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/19/rochdale-greater-manchester-police-failed-children-in-the-past-says-chief-constable
4/20/2022,"A vote will be held later this week on whether a special parliamentary investigation should be launched into Boris Johnson’s Partygate denials. Separate from the Whitehall and police inquiries, this would specifically look at if the prime minister purposely misled parliament. Opposition parties have called for a special body known as the privileges committee to look into if Johnson deliberately misled MPs. The prime minister made repeated denials to the Commons that any rules were broken in Downing Street – but Scotland Yard has now put paid to that, and confirmed that parties which breached lockdown laws did take place in No 10 and other parts of Whitehall. Given that the ministerial code carries the unambiguous direction that any breaches should result in a resignation, Labour wants the matter to be scrutinised instead of being brushed under the carpet. Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, has said Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, can table a motion on Wednesday for debate – with a vote on Thursday – about referring the matter to the committee. This cross-party group of seven MPs has a Conservative majority, but is chaired by Labour’s Chris Bryant. It is not convened very often, but is meant to look at possible breaches of privilege or contempt of parliament. MPs on the committee would have to look into an incredibly tricky subject – trying to ascertain whether Johnson deliberately misled parliament. This is a charge many opposition MPs admit would be difficult to prove. But to uncover the truth the committee could call for papers, summon witnesses and – if necessary – recommend a sanction such as suspension or expulsion. The sanction would still have to be accepted or rejected by the Commons, so with its large majority the government should expect to comfortably kill off anything that arises. The short answer is probably not. Partly because many Tory MPs seem to have accepted Johnson’s apology, but also because the Conservative whips’ office may effectively treat it as a confidence vote. This means they could tell any backbenchers that the price for voting with the opposition is being kicked out of the parliamentary party – effectively ending their political career. On Tuesday, when Johnson was quizzed in the Commons if that was the case by the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, he dodged the question. There are some who feel it is an important constitutional principle that ministers should not be allowed to mislead parliament, so do not want Johnson to get off lightly for fear of setting a precedent. But there are other, more political, motivations at play. There are a large number of Conservative MPs whose backing of Johnson has been far from full-throated, instead choosing to keep quiet, waiting for the Met investigation to conclude and Sue Gray’s report to be published. They will be forced to nail their colours to the mast and vote to let Johnson evade further scrutiny if they decide to oppose a privileges committee investigation. Much wrangling was done over the wording of the motion – the final version of which is yet to be seen – to try to make it as tempting as possible for Tory MPs to back. An initial attempt to have a vote on whether Johnson should be found in contempt of parliament has been abandoned, in favour of a move that is ostensibly more innocuous. It can also be presented as increasing transparency around what has been a very murky issue. Johnson will escape having to defend himself, given he will be on a trip to India. But Labour and the Liberal Democrats are already priming digital adverts to roll out in the run-up to the local elections. They think this could reopen barely healed wounds, allowing them to send the message that Tory MPs are voting to spare their own – Johnson could be saved from further investigation in a manner akin to Owen Paterson.",News/Politics,Partygate: how would a parliamentary investigation work? ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/19/partygate-how-would-a-parliamentary-investigation-work
4/20/2022,"Tyson Fury chose to avoid discussing the troubling news story that continues to reverberate as he met the media in person for the first time since the US Treasury announced last week that it had imposed sanctions against a leading figure involved in boxing. Daniel Kinahan, who has been subject for years to allegations that he leads a notorious drug cartel, has advised and acted on behalf of many fighters, including Fury. The US authorities have offered a $5m reward for further information which could lead to the exiled Irishman being arrested and then brought to trial to answer numerous serious criminal allegations. An American state spokesman also warned that anyone in boxing who is still involved with Kinahan needs to cut all ties with him or risk being implicated in his activities. Kinahan has no criminal convictions and has always denied any wrongdoing. Fury, speaking to the Guardian, stressed that he was not willing to discuss any business but his own and that he was “just a boxer” who was not qualified to comment on the US government stance. Later, when meeting a small group of national newspaper journalists, including the Guardian, Fury repeated: “It’s none of my business. I keep my own business to myself, that’s it.” When it was pointed out that his American promoter Bob Arum had admitted over the weekend that he had paid Kinahan more than $4m for four fights featuring Fury between 2019 and 2021, the world heavyweight champion said: “That’s Bob Arum’s personal business. He can spend it all on gummy bears if he wants to. What someone does with their money is out of my control.” Fury and his British promoter, Frank Warren, were at Wembley to publicise the title fight this Saturday between Fury and Dillian Whyte. Warren said: “Let me make a couple of things very clear – one, Daniel Kinahan has nothing to do with this show and, two, as Tyson said, he was unaware of any payments made by Top Rank to Daniel Kinahan.” Warren and Fury were asked if they felt concern about the implications for their sport and the veteran British promoter said: “I am concerned, but I’m also concerned about some of the misinformation that’s going around. We’re not stupid people. All of us understand what has happened from the US Treasury. It’s been going on now for three years and we all know what we have to do and we will not be breaking the law. We’ve never broken the law.” Fury joked: “I had a speeding ticket once.” Warren then said: “Is it a bad image for boxing? We sold 94,000 tickets in two days. Are we going to do good business on pay-per-view? Yes we are. We are very conscious about what we have to do as the guardians of the sport but we are not policemen. It’s only last week that [allegations surrounding Kinahan have] come to something.” Asked if the Kinahan saga, which holds such serious implications for boxing, has been distracting, Fury shook his head. “Not really, it’s got nowt to do with me, has it? If I say there’s a war going on in Ukraine and people ask me about that, it’s got nowt to do with me. I keep my business to myself. I’ve got my own troubles to look after with six kids and a wife nagging me to death for not being at home to help with the kids. I’ve got a lot more to think about than other people’s business. I’ve got a man who wants to punch my face in [on Saturday] and I’ve got to deal with that. Anything else is out of my control.” When pressed to admit that it is a significant story, Fury said: “I don’t really take any notice of the media. I know what the media can do and I was the victim of a witch-hunt in 2015 and 2016 [when he was suffering from mental health issues and retired for a year from boxing].” Earlier on Tuesday, it was confirmed that Bob Yalen had resigned as chief executive of MTK Global. The American is said to have made his decision amid mounting pressure as scrutiny of Kinahan became a public priority of the US government. MTK was founded under the name of MGM by Kinahan and the former boxer Matthew Macklin in 2012. The company has tried to protest that it is no longer associated with him but various MTK boxers, including Fury, have posted photographs of themselves with Kinahan on social media. There was no MTK logo on Fury’s tracksuit at Wembley and he said: “This was made for me to wear today and these are all my sponsors. That’s it. I have never been sponsored by MTK ever.” Reminded that he has worn the MTK logo before, his previously jocular mood became sharper. “That was from 2017 until 2020. Three years and that was it. Done. End of. Any more probing questions that you can think of to trip me up? Because you can’t. There is nothing that I have to hide. Is there any more?” Asked about the photograph taken of him and Kinahan smiling together in Dubai in February, Fury said: “A picture doesn’t mean I am a criminal. There could be a criminal in this building now. It doesn’t mean I am involved in his criminal activity does it?” Whyte, meanwhile, was notably absent from the open workout. “I am very disappointed he is not here today,” Warren said. “Apparently he is stuck on a plane or whatever it is. He will certainly be here tomorrow [at the press conference on Wednesday].” Fury added, with a big smile. “I’m sure he will because if he doesn’t show up, there’ll be murders. There’ll be trouble. [Dillian] you’d better show your ass.”",Sport/Sport,Tyson Fury refuses to address Daniel Kinahan sanctions story ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/tyson-fury-refuses-to-address-daniel-kinahan-sanctions-story
4/20/2022,"Russia is preparing to take legal action to challenge the freeze on its $600bn (£462bn) foreign currency war chest put in place by western governments after the invasion of Ukraine, the head of the country’s central bank has said. Elvira Nabiullina said plans were being made to launch lawsuits after governments including the US, UK and EU froze the Russian central bank’s foreign currency reserves held within their jurisdictions. “This freezing of gold and foreign exchange reserves was unprecedented, so we are going to work on legal claims, and we are getting ready to put them forward,” Nabiullina was quoted as saying by the Kremlin-backed Tass news agency. “This block on the gold and foreign exchange reserves of such a large country is unprecedented on a global scale.” Viewed as the toughest economic sanction imposed on the country after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, the asset freeze is designed to prevent Russia from softening the blow to its financial system and wider economy from a range of other economic penalties. Russia had built up more than $600bn worth of foreign currency reserves held in dollars, gold and other currencies, with about half believed to be frozen by the restrictions imposed on its central bank. Built up over several years under a so-called “fortress Russia” strategy following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, the sanctions make it harder for the central bank to intervene in currency markets to defend the value of the rouble. Nabiullina did not detail when or where a legal challenge could be made. Her comments follow a similar threat made by Russia’s finance minister, Anton Siluanov, who said earlier this month that the Kremlin would sue if the west tried to force it to default on its sovereign debt. In one example of such a legal case involving central bank reserves, the UK supreme court ruled in December against a Venezuelan appeal to allow access to almost $2bn of gold it held at the Bank of England. The rouble crashed in value by more than 40% after western governments first imposed sweeping economic sanctions, although it has recovered to pre-invasion levels over recent weeks. Without access to half of its foreign currency reserves, the Russian central bank imposed tight capital controls and raised interest rates in an attempt to bolster the currency. Nabiullina appeared to suggest the sanctions were having an impact, saying there would be “no need for such draconian measures” if it had access to its $600bn war chest. “We have introduced these currency regulations. I know that many enterprises also complained a lot in terms of foreign economic activity, when it was difficult to pay. But it was a forced measure. If we had these gold and foreign exchange reserves in possession, and had this part not been frozen, there would have been no need for such draconian measures on the movement of capital,” she said. The central bank governor was added on Tuesday by the Canadian government to a list of sanctioned individuals alongside 13 other Russians including Putin’s two adult daughters. Marking the first time she has been personally singled out by a western government, the Canadian government said it was doing so to hold the Russian president “and his associates accountable for their complicity in the Russian regime’s invasion of Ukraine”.",News/Business,Russia ‘preparing legal action’ to unfreeze $600bn foreign currency reserves,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/russia-preparing-legal-action-to-unfreeze-600bn-foreign-currency-reserves
4/20/2022,"Boris Johnson does not care about parliamentary customs or decency or the truth. If he did then he would have gone long ago. By breaking the lockdown rules he had made, the prime minister breached the ministerial code – which expresses the country’s constitutional conventions – on two counts. First, despite his denial, Mr Johnson has “knowingly misled parliament”. This is a resigning matter because parliament could not do its job to scrutinise the government without truthful ministerial responses to MPs’ questions. Mr Johnson’s claim of ignorance of his government’s policy on the biggest issue of the day is risible. He may face many more fines. It seems fanciful to go on claiming that such gatherings, lubricated by alcohol, were impossible to distinguish from the business of the state. Not only has Mr Johnson lied; his mealy-mouthed apology reveals him to be man who wears his mendacity lightly. This is dangerous for democracy. A prime minister whose words are not believed is not capable of leading. What happens if Covid rates are judged in the near future to require masks to be worn in crowded areas? Mr Johnson has lost the trust of voters, and it is unlikely that the public would want to hear any message about restrictions that he was bearing. The second violation of the ministerial code is perhaps even more serious. Mr Johnson is the first serving British prime minister to be punished for breaking the law when the ministerial code expects him to follow it. Unfortunately, it is Mr Johnson who has to decide the sanction he ought to face. There is no sign that he is prepared to do the right thing and resign. His career has been marked by a belief that the rules are for other people. A government that imposes laws it does not follow itself has no legitimacy in the eyes of the public. In response to Mr Johnson’s drift – or gallop – towards an authoritarian administration, Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, suggested that MPs vote later this week on whether to refer the prime minister to the parliamentary privileges committee to investigate whether he misled MPs. This allows for all parliamentarians to put on record their view of the prime minister’s evasions. Mr Johnson’s argument that this is a partisan act because the privileges committee is presided over by an opposition MP evaporates when one discovers that this is a requirement of parliamentary rules. In the UK, lawmakers can dismiss the executive if not satisfied with its performance. Strong party discipline can prevent this – but unpopular leaders are dethroned. Fealty may explain why some Conservatives have argued that Mr Johnson’s fine is no more serious than a speeding ticket, even when they know the fine that the prime minister paid was for breaking rules regarding his key life-saving Covid policy. Mr Johnson disregards constitutional standards for short-term and politically self-interested reasons. A diminished prime minister who has few fixed opinions might be seen as useful to MPs who yearn to reassert themselves. However, the result will be policymaking marked by chaos rather than purpose. Many Tories fear making life harder for council candidates in May’s local elections. But the longer he is in office, the more the organising principle of Mr Johnson’s Tory party will be loyalty. Not devotion to a vision or a legislative platform, but to just one man and his many shortcomings. Conservative MPs should realise that this is dangerous to them, their party and the country, and turf Mr Johnson from office.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson’s apology: time to vote PM from office | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/19/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-apology-time-to-vote-the-pm-from-office
4/20/2022,"Rishi Sunak’s first attempt to “take the sting out” of rising household energy bills was a bits-and-pieces £9bn support package that seemed to rest on the idea that the crisis would go away soon. The giveaway in the thinking was the £200 per household “rebate” that represented about half the headline figure. It wasn’t a rebate in a true sense – it was just a means to shove a portion of customers’ bill into later years, when, the chancellor was presumably calculating, wholesale prices would be lower. The plan sounded hopeful when unveiled in February but now reads as naive and politically unfeasible. Latest projections suggest October’s price cap will rise by another £600 per household on average – that’s on top of the £694 increase that kicked in at the start of this month. And a key point, as a battalion of energy bosses told MPs on the business and energy select committee on Tuesday, is that the new tariff will apply during the winter months of peak consumption. That matters to anybody who pays for their energy via a prepayment meter, which typically tends to be lower-income households. At the moment, the hit from April’s higher tariff has been slightly softened by lower consumption levels. Come October, higher prices will coincide with a rise in demand. Further fiddles with “rebates”, or even a further widening of the £150 a year warm homes discount scheme, aren’t going to cut it. Even today’s position is generating a surge in bad debts and calls from concerned customers, all the chief executives reported. Here was Keith Anderson of Scottish Power: “It has got to a stage now where the size and scale of it is beyond what I can deal with, beyond what I think this industry can deal with. I think it needs a massive shift, a significant shift in the government policy and approach towards this.” His suggested shift was a £1,000 a year discount for households in fuel poverty or on prepay meters via what he called a “deficit fund”. If 8m households will soon be in fuel poverty (defined as those spending at least 10% of their net income on energy), as some forecasts suggest, that’s a commitment to find £8bn a year – in real money, rather than artful deferrals and suchlike – as long as the crisis lasts. The chancellor may take fright at such sums, but they sound like a hard-headed appraisal of the problem. Barring a miracle in the wholesale gas market, the real price shock has yet to arrive. Alternatives to Anderson’s idea are available, but it’s time for Sunak to get serious about designing a support scheme that can last longer than a summer. Crucially, it also needs to be announced ahead of time to reassure consumers. Allowing events to drift until October would be inexcusable. Hayden Wood, the co-founder and chief executive of Bulb, at least had the sense to sound sheepish before the same MPs. Apologies for his firm’s failure came thick and fast. Quite right too: Bulb was the biggest collapse within the retail energy sector and the company is being propped up in special administration via taxpayer support that, at the Office for Budget Responsibility’s last estimate, will reach £2.2bn. In the circumstances, the revelation that Wood is still being paid his £250,000 a year salary is extraordinary. Yes, the administrators may want him to hang around but, come on, it’s been five months since Bulb’s corporate lights went out and a buyer isn’t yet in sight. An invitation to Wood to cut his salary (massively) is in order. There’s little doubt that private equity firm TDR Capital and the Issa brothers enjoyed good timing when they financed last year’s £6.8bn leveraged buyout of Asda. Morrisons, the yardstick for comparison, was subsequently sold at a higher multiple of earnings. Even so, one should take TDR’s claim of a near-20 times return on its thin equity slice with a pinch of salt. Yes, the marketing documents seen by the FT probably offer valuation support of a sort. The nose-bleed level of financial gearing made the deal a work of supreme financial engineering and a few post-acquisition disposals will have eased the debt metrics slightly. Yet the tricky part is turning a paper profit into a real one. Morrisons is already warning of lower profits and Tesco is making aggressive noises on prices. TDR’s pathway to getting out of Asda currently looks long and uncertain.",News/Business,Time for Rishi Sunak to get serious about helping with energy bills | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/19/time-rishi-sunak-get-serious-helping-energy-bills
4/20/2022,"Russia’s war on Ukraine has entered a new phase with the launch of its punishing offensive on the eastern Donbas region yesterday. But this next stage, the result of its utter failure to quickly capture Kyiv and overthrow the government as Vladimir Putin planned, is set to be as brutal and dangerous. Almost 5 million Ukrainians have now fled their country. Yet on Friday and Saturday, for the first time since Mr Putin’s troops invaded on 24 February, more people crossed into Ukraine from Poland than left that way. Some of those will have been aid workers; many were Ukrainians who hoped that the withdrawal of Russian forces from central areas of the country late last month allowed at least a temporary return to their homes or a brief reunion with husbands, fathers and sons. It might superficially appear that the war is entering a no less vicious but at least more predictable phase with its concentration in the Donbas. After eight years of war there, claiming over 14,000 lives, its people now face a relentless barrage of missiles as Moscow attacks along a 300-mile front. Around 70% are estimated to have left the region already, and some local officials have urged all civilians to evacuate. Russian forces had seized the city of Kreminna within hours. In the south, they were attempting to crush the last resistance in Mariupol, aiming to create a land bridge between annexed Crimea and the east. At least 1,000 civilians, including children and the elderly, were reportedly sheltering in the Azovstal steelworks as the Russian military advanced on the last Ukrainian troops holding out in underground passages there. US officials have said they believe Mr Putin wants something to celebrate on Victory Day, 9 May, when Nazi Germany’s defeat in the second world war is marked with a vast military parade in Red Square. Military analysts suggest that Russia’s troops could gain the advantage in more conventional warfare on largely open, flat terrain. The shorter supply lines should help them overcome the logistics problems they encountered earlier, while the Russian air force will have easier, less risky bombing runs. They are also aided by Ukrainian separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk self-styled republics. Set against this are claims of low morale among Mr Putin’s troops, who face Ukraine’s most experienced forces, spirits raised by their country’s initial success in repelling Russia. The flow of arms from western countries, while still well short of Kyiv’s aspirations, is steadily increasing in scope as well as quantity. Above all, Ukrainians have every reason to fight. They have seen that Russian “liberation” may leave little more than ruins. They assume Mr Putin’s aim remains the subjugation of the whole of their country, with victory in the east not a suitable, face-saving exit from an unexpectedly bruising conflict but a staging post along the road to complete domination. Yet they are painfully aware that Russian failures can come at a high cost too: the brutality seen in Bucha and elsewhere; the threat of non-conventional weapons. With families, homes and communities shattered by the earlier attacks or the shadow of conflict, the best that Ukrainians outside the east can expect for now is a temporary respite. Meanwhile, it is not only Ukrainians who are chilled by the prospect of further escalation. Fifty-five days after this war began, its end appears no clearer or closer.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on war in Ukraine: a new but no less brutal phase | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/19/the-guardian-view-on-war-in-ukraine-a-new-but-no-less-brutal-phase
4/20/2022,"Top leaders in the Oath Keepers militia group indicted on seditious conspiracy charges over the Capitol attack had contacts with the Proud Boys and a figure in the Stop the Steal movement and may also have been in touch with the Republican congressman Ronny Jackson, newly released text messages show. The texts – which indicate the apparent ease with which Oath Keepers messaged Proud Boys – could strengthen a theory being explored by the House January 6 committee and the US justice department: that the Capitol attack included a coordinated assault. Oath Keepers text messages released in a court filing on Monday night showed members of the group were in direct communication with the Proud Boys leader Enqrique Tarrio in the days before the Capitol attack. In an exchange on 4 January 2021, the Oath Keepers Florida chapter leader, Kelly Meggs, indicates an attempt to call Tarrio after learning of his arrest. “I just called him no answer,” Meggs texted a group chat. “But he will [call if] he’s out.” That close relationship is certain to be of interest to the House committee as it zeroes in on whether the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys coordinated an attack on the Capitol in an attempt to stop certification of Joe Biden’s election win over Donald Trump. As the Guardian first reported, the committee has amassed deep evidence of connections between the far-right groups which could play a role in establishing whether Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy as part of his attempt to hold on to power. The newly released text messages also show a new link between the Oath Keepers and an unnamed figure from the Stop the Steal movement, which has ties to the pro-Trump operative Roger Stone and to Ali Alexander, a prominent Trump ally and activist. On the evening of 1 January, Stewart Rhodes, the national leader of the Oath Keepers, texted to say he was adding an unidentified person affiliated with Stop the Steal to the group chat, to help them prepare for January 6. The name was redacted in the released texts but Rhodes described an “event producer for Stop the Steal. He requested I add him here. He can sort out who is doing what in the creative chaos that will be Jan 5/6. “He’s a good egg.” It was not clear whether Rhodes misattributed an affiliation to Stop the Steal, given the January 6 rally at the Ellipse was a Save America event. Neither Alexander nor Stone appeared to message the group chat or were otherwise involved. The Oath Keepers text messages also show a connection to Ronny Jackson that allowed one of its members to learn that the Texas congressman – Trump’s former White House doctor – needed protection as the Capitol attack unfolded. The potential connection between the Oath Keepers and a Republican member of Congress could mark a new investigatory direction for the committee and the justice department: whether Jackson or others might have had advance knowledge of the Oath Keepers’ plans. In the exchange on January 6, an unidentified Oath Keeper texts the group chat that “Ronnie Jackson (TX) office inside Capitol – he needs OK help. Anyone inside?” The same Oath Keeper provides an update less than 10 minutes later: “Dr Ronnie Jackson – on the move. Needs protection. If anyone inside cover him. He has critical data to protect.” Rhodes quickly responds: “Give him my cell.” In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson said Jackson “is frequently talked about by people he does not know. He does not know nor has he ever spoken to the people in question”. Asked if Jackson was never in contact with the Oath Keepers, the spokesperson did not answer. The House committee has not given any indication that Republican members of Congress were connected to a potential conspiracy overseen by Trump that would connect his plan to have then-vice president Mike Pence overturn the election with the Capitol attack. The Oath Keepers texts were included in a motion for release from pre-trial detention by Ed Vallejo, one of 11 group members facing charges of seditious conspiracy. On January 6, prosecutors say, Vallejo was at a Comfort Inn in Virginia with a cache of weapons, meant to act as a quick reaction force. The messages show the Oath Keepers discussed providing security for prominent Trump allies including Stone, Alexander, Alex Jones, Lin Wood and Mike Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser. One week before January 6, Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers, mentioned requests to provide security for Bianca Garcia, president of the group Latinos for Trump, for which Tarrio, the Proud Boys leader, was also chief of staff. The next day, Meggs, the Florida Oath Keepers leader who would ultimately lead Stone’s security detail, boasted that he had spoken to Stone the night before. Jessica Watkins, another member of the Oath Keepers, said she was also in touch with Stone. “Roger Stone just asked for security,” Watkins texted the group chat on 1 January, to which Meggs responded: “Who reached out to you? I [spoke] to him Wednesday.” Meggs – using the alias “OK Gator 1” – added: “I just texted him.” Though the Oath Keepers discussed providing security for other Trump allies, the extent of their voluntary services remains unclear. Alexander said in a recent statement that the Oath Keepers did not perform security duties for him on January 6.",News/US news,"Oath Keepers and Proud Boys were in touch before US Capitol attack, texts reveal",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/19/oath-keepers-proud-boys-capitol-attack-texts
4/20/2022,"The owner of nightclubs including Pryzm and Atik plans to open at least 10 more bars this year,after attendance at the group’s 48 UK outlets recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Club owner Rekom also pointed to evidence that Brits are spending more on drinks in nightclubs and bars than they did in March 2020 – and turning up earlier on a night out – with young people trying to catch up on more than two years of pandemic restrictions. “I’m cautiously optimistic,” said Peter Marks, chief executive of Rekom. He will open the UK’s second Heidi’s Bier Bar in Birmingham next month to be followed by its first Proud Mary bar in Swansea, both tried-and-tested concepts of the group’s Scandinavian owners. “We haven’t experienced the consumer price squeeze yet but most of our guests are under 25 and they are not the people paying the electric bill, filling the car or paying the mortgage. We have found our business to be fairly recession proof as it is low ticket and high volume business.” Copenhagen-based Rekom expanded into the UK in 2020, buying 42 of the former Deltic Group’s UK clubs and bars out of administration in January 2021, leaving 10 destined for closure. The group has now built back to 48 UK outlets, taking back some of its former sites and adding new ones. Marks said many of Rekom’s clients were turning up an hour earlier than usual, having not previously had a chance to experience a nightclub as they came of age during the pandemic. Its research found people were spending almost the same as they did pre-pandemic on a night out – £68.03 compared to £68.68 – and going out just as often. They are spending £19.56 each on drinking in clubs and bars, up from £19.25 in March 2019, and slightly more on drinks before they head out, £11.42 compared to £11.31. The amount spent on food, however, has dropped by about 3% to £15.70. Just over 60% of 18 to 24-year-olds said they were more enthusiastic about going out to clubs and festivals because of missing out during the pandemic and almost half of 25- to 34-year-olds said the same. Rekom’s optimistic outlook comes as new evidence suggests the total number of licensed venues in the UK has shrunk by 8% since March 2020 with 9,200 fewer sites. Independent operators took the brunt of the hit, with 8.7% closing, according to the latest research by consultancy CGA and advisory firm AlixPartners, while 4.8% of chains or managed pubs closed. Karl Chessell, CGA’s director for hospitality operators and food for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said consumer demand and investor confidence remained strong with a “stream of new entrants” offsetting closures in recent months. “There is a lot of turmoil going on,” he said. “Heavy inflationary pressures and staffing and supply issues are making conditions extremely difficult, and we can expect to see a steady flow of both closures and new openings as the year goes on.”",News/Business,Pryzm owner to open 10 new bars in the UK as nightlife recovers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/pryzm-owner-to-open-10-new-bars-in-the-uk-as-nightlife-recovers
4/20/2022,"Robert Eggers’ new movie, The Northman, arrives in Australian cinemas this week. In order to get prepped for this bloody tale of Viking vengeance, check out his unsettling horror debut The Witch: a folk horror movie that does not rely on gore to terrify the audience, but instead gradually worms its way under your skin in order to slowly unnerve you. It’s not the plunge from the top of the rollercoaster but a slow drive down a dark, country lane. Set in 1630, a Puritan settler family are banished from their New England village following a heated religious argument in the colony. Isolated theologically and physically, patriarch William (Ralph Ineson) moves to the edge of a vast, dense forest with his family: wife Katherine (Kate Dickie) and their children Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), twins Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson), and infant Samuel. But nature is unforgiving and the family’s crops fail. Suddenly, while under Thomasin’s care, baby Samuel disappears, stolen by a witch who dwells within the forest. This tangled woodland is the demarcation line between the God-fearing Puritans and the ancient, primal terror living within it. Witchcraft was an accepted reality of the 17th century: William and his family live in accordance with their strict religious convictions and if God exists, so too must the Devil. When events start to unravel, we believe it because they believe it. But it is not solely the witch’s actions that cause family bonds to deteriorate. Existing tensions are strained by the failing harvest and, as Thomasin was responsible for Sam when he was taken, it is not long before fingers are pointed her way. There is also an interesting level of ambiguity to the tale – is this all the result of simple bad luck, or does each family member hold any level of responsibility for what befalls them? Eggers’ meticulous attention to detail goes a long a way to making The Witch work. Costumes were made from 17th century patterns, the houses constructed faithfully in the thatched style of the time. Even the dialogue is cribbed from genuine diary entries and documents from the period. While the characters’ manner of speaking may take a little getting used to at first, the payoff is an immersive and authentic experience. With the Pilgrims having only recently arrived in North America, Eggers cast British actors in the movie. Ineson’s imposing height and gravelly accent lend William important gravitas, and Dickie convincingly spirals in the face of disaster upon disaster. But most notably, this is Taylor-Joy’s first film, and Thomasin is the most complex character of all. As the eldest child, she spends most of her time trying to corral her boisterous younger siblings and getting blamed for everything. She has little in the way of options for her future. In many ways, she is the black sheep of the family. Mark Korven’s twisted score uses abrasive strings, sinister drones and weird vocalisations to fray your nerves; even seemingly innocuous events are made malevolent with these off-kilter undertones. And Jarin Blaschke’s atmospheric cinematography contrasts the chaos of nature against the neat order of the austere farmland. Ultimately, The Witch works so well because it values atmosphere, slowly cultivating a pervasive sense of dread over sleazier, cheap thrills. This is not a film that will be forgotten as soon as the credits roll, for The Witch prefers to crawl inside your head and stay there.",Arts/Film,The Witch: Robert Eggers’ folk horror debut worms its way under your skin,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/20/the-witch-robert-eggers-folk-horror-debut-worms-its-way-under-your-skin
4/20/2022,"The number of deaths from Covid-19 in Australia this year to date has reached more than double the deaths from 2020 and 2021 combined. According to federal health department data as of 18 April, 6,786 people have died of Covid-19 in Australia since the beginning of the pandemic. Of these deaths, 4,547 occurred in 2022 – more than double the 2,239 deaths recorded over the first two years of the pandemic. Prof Adrian Esterman, a biostatistician at the University of South Australia, said the figures were unsurprising given the high transmission of Covid in recent months. He criticised a relaxation of policies on face masks and social distancing, which he said was sending the message to the general public that the pandemic was over. “Unfortunately, the virus doesn’t know that. We’re still seeing thousands of people being infected; we’re seeing many, many people ending up in hospital,” he said. “Yes, it’s no longer an absolute acute emergency like it was, because we have a large percentage of our population vaccinated and we’ve got better treatments. But the fact of the matter is it’s still there. We could still get another variant coming along tomorrow, which is worse than Delta.” Though the Omicron variant results in less severe disease on an individual level compared to Delta, its high transmissibility had led to vast numbers of infections, Esterman said. “If even only a small percentage of those get severely ill, end up in hospital or die, they’re still big numbers and that’s what we’re seeing. It’s not only hospitalisation and deaths – it’s long Covid [too].” Hassan Vally, an associate professor of epidemiology at Deakin University, said despite the death figures, the implications of getting infected were not the same as two years ago. “The relationship we have to the Sars-CoV-2 virus is very different now to how it was in March 2020,” he said. “When we give people immunity, we change the risk calculus; this was the main reason for vaccinating the community. We wanted to reduce the risk, even if people get infected, of going on to develop severe disease and die. “We’re moving away from the emergency response phase in terms of responding to Covid-19 and we’re transitioning to the disease control phase, which involves implementing more sustainable measures to control transmission. “We should be focusing more on interventions that are sustainable – that is, ones that we can maintain as we get back to living our lives normally. The most important of these are being vaccinated and wearing masks in high-risk environments.” Vally said that due to the inaccuracy of reported case numbers, which likely only captured a fraction of all infections, death figures were currently “the most robust indicator of how we’re tracking”. The figures come as the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, suggested the peak of the state’s latest Omicron wave had passed. Andrews told reporters in Wangaratta on Tuesday: “The seven day average is very pleasingly coming down, so that says to me … that the peak has come and gone. We just have to wait and see though that those few days of data turn into the trend that we hope that it is.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Andrews said the health minister was set to “make some positive announcements” regarding Covid measures after case numbers began to decline. Last week, Andrews flagged the vaccinated economy, QR codes and isolation requirements for close contacts of Covid-19 cases could be scrapped after the latest outbreak peaked. “We’ll get down to very, very few rules very soon and that’s not a credit to anybody other than every single Victorian who’s got a first dose or a second dose and the 66% of people who’ve got a third dose [of a Covid-19 vaccine],” he said on Tuesday. Esterman said he expected case numbers to drop very slowly or even plateau. “One of the reasons is that we’ve seen a very poor uptake of the third dose, the booster dose … we know that two doses won’t protect you against infection,” he said. “That third dose is critical. We need to get that up to nearly 100%,” he said, adding that people over 65 should get their fourth Covid jab as soon as possible.",News/Australia news,Australia’s Covid death toll in 2022 more than double that of previous two years,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/20/australias-covid-death-toll-in-2022-more-than-double-that-of-previous-two-years
4/20/2022,"The NRL could be on the verge of an American Dream, a season opener with the potential to make rugby league relevant in the United States. The competition has reportedly revived discussions about staging a historic premiership game between Manly and South Sydney in Los Angeles to open the 2023 campaign. Clubs will be banking on the Hollywood pull power of Rabbitohs owner Russell Crowe and Sea Eagles supporter Hugh Jackman three years after plans in 2019 fell through. But it is not the first time Australian sports have tried to gain exposure and relevance in the lucrative US market. Well, sort of. It was an exhibition match following the already-completed 1987 series, in Long Beach, California. Three weeks after Queensland retained the shield, New South Wales beat them 30-18 at Veterans Memorial Stadium. While the result did not count towards the series, it is included in the player appearance and records calculations. In terms of publicity, though, it barely made a squeak, with the crowd figure contested but reported to be around 12,000. To date it is the only Origin game taken to the US. The NRL’s Magic Round, which features all eight games at the same venue, started in 2019 and has been played in Brisbane every year since. However it is seen by the game’s administrators as a concept easily transferred abroad, with a view to replicating the festival-like atmosphere of the UK Super League’s Magic Round, with Los Angeles and even Las Vegas floated as prospective venues. In 2019 the NRL’s then chief executive Todd Greenberg signposted bold plans, calling Magic Round “a product that lends itself to emerging markets”. “We’d absolutely look at taking it overseas,” he told the Sydney Morning Herald. Australian rules has long attempted to promote the game outside of its heartlands, as far back as the first and second world wars , during which Australian troops organised exhibition and scratch matches in Europe and Asia. Some years later, in 1960, Melbourne and Geelong tried to crack the American market by playing the first exhibition matches in major US cities in Honolulu and San Francisco respectively. The games events drew little attention and were attended by only 1,500 and 3,500 spectators. In 1987, Perth magnate Errol Marron hatched an audacious plan to base a VFL expansion club in Los Angeles – named the Los Angeles Crocodiles to piggyback on the huge international popularity of Crocodile Dundee and Paul Hogan. The radical proposal – an attempt to save the floundering competition – involved the teams playing four blocks of three games in Australia with eight teams making the trip to LA every season, and included the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Despite sponsors and airlines having pledged support and ESPN approached as a broadcaster, VFL chairman Ross Oakley announced the league had rejected the bid. Still, the VFL scheduled more exhibition games in 1988 (Collingwood v Geelong, Miami), 1989 (Essendon v Hawthorn, Miami) and 1990 (Melbourne v West Coast, Portland). The latter, directly after the VFL was rebranded as the AFL, generated the most interest. Early in 2020 reports emerged that the Bombers and Greater Western Sydney Giants were planning to play a game for premiership points on the west coast of America. But talks had not progressed past the preliminary stage when the pandemic struck and they were put on ice. Both clubs were reportedly still eager to make it happen though it is unclear when. If a match does come to fruition it will make the US the third nation beyond Australia to host a game, following Sydney Swans and St Kilda in New Zealand in 2013 and Port Adelaide Power v Gold Coast Suns in China in 2017.",Sport/Sport,American dream: when Australian sport tries to crack the US market,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/american-dream-when-australian-sport-tries-to-crack-the-us-market
4/20/2022,"A resources company says it will “pursue all avenues” to overturn the Queensland government’s decision to reject its coal exploration licence in an area of prime farmland near a marine breeding ground for the southern Great Barrier Reef. The move from Fox Resources has sparked calls for the federal candidates for two central Queensland seats – including the resources minister, Keith Pitt – to “put an end” to mining development licence MDL3040 by joining widespread opposition to the coking coal proposal north of Bundaberg. Farmers, environmentalists and community advocates are also calling on the state government to kill off the prospect of mining exploration on prime agricultural and environmentally sensitive land across the state. Earlier this month Queensland’s resources minister, Scott Stewart, refused Fox Resources’ proposal for a mineral development licence between Avondale and Moore Park Beach on the grounds of ​​public interest, citing “significant adverse community sentiment” and the “potential negative environmental, agricultural and social impacts in the Bundaberg region.” The chair of Fox Resources, Terry Streeter, indicated the company planned to launch a judicial review on the call that the proposal was not in the public interest. “Fox does not agree or accept this decision, and will pursue all avenues to have the decision reversed,” Streeter said in a statement to shareholders. The statement, released the day after the government’s announcement, questioned the timing of Stewart’s call and foreshadowed grounds for a judicial challenge. “In making the decision, the minister has not identified any scientific or technical reasons for concern with the activities proposed under MDLA 3040,” it read. At a state and local level, opposition to Fox Resources’ plans to develop a coking coalmine is broad and bipartisan. The state Liberal National party MP for Burnett, Stephen Bennett, has been a longstanding and vocal opponent of the application. He welcomed the state’s Labor government’s rejection of it, though questioned why it had taken so long. He called on the government to go further and “kill off” the prospect of mining exploration in agriculturally productive and environmentally sensitive areas across the state. A year ago, Bundaberg council voted unanimously to oppose any potential mining activity in the high-value agricultural land north of the city. The then mayor and former LNP state minister, Jack Dempsey, has since announced his candidacy as an independent for the seat of Hinkler, which includes Bundaberg. Dempsey has seized on opposition to coal as one of the central issues in his campaign to unseat Pitt, the federal resources minister. MDL3040 falls within the adjoining seat of Flynn, but many of its impacts will be felt in Bundaberg, where the economy is built upon crops like macadamias, vegetables and sugar cane grown in surrounding areas, including Avondale. Although state and local representatives have vied to outdo one another by talking tough on Fox Resource’s mining development proposal, federal candidates in Hinkler and Flynn are refusing to weigh into the matter. Pitt declined to comment, other than to say it was a state issue. The LNP candidate for Flynn, Colin Boyce, did not respond to questions from the Guardian Australia, nor did his Labor opponent, Matt Burnett. Dempsey said the “fence-sitting” from his direct opponent was the “missing link in showing united community opposition to ripping up farmland for coal”. “Farmers, the tourism industry, environmentalists, residents, state MPs and councillors are all against it,” he said. “Mr Pitt needs to tell Fox Resources they are not welcome in this region.” Alan Corbett, a spokesperson for Moore Park Beach Action Group who has been lobbying against the mining exploration proposal, backed Dempsey’s call for federal candidates to outline their positions on the proposal. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Corbett said both major party candidates in Flynn, who are strong advocates of the mining sector, had indicated that they did not support the prospect of mining in the food bowl north of Bundaberg in private conversations but needed to go further. “I think if they came out publicly, that would well and truly put an end to this,” he said. Judy Plath, a Farnsfield cane farmer and campaigner against mining on farmland, said she was grateful to Bennett, the LNP’s MP for Burnett, for “standing strong with the community”, but said the party “more broadly” needed to have a “long and hard look at who their supporters are”. “I believe any mining activity that threatens our precious water supplies and ability to grow food for our nation should be of major concern to the National party,” she said. “We need to see stronger leadership when it comes to prioritising food production over mining.” Corbett and Plath also called on state Labor to ban mining exploration in areas of agricultural and environmental significance. Ellie Smith, a spokesperson for the pressure group Lock the Gate, said the organisation was calling on the state government to do a thorough review into its Regional Planning Interests Act 2014, which was supposed to protect prime agricultural land but “has never worked”. She said mining exploration should not be allowed in areas of environmental and cultural significance, close to established communities and in prime agricultural land, and that the Avondale area “ticked all those boxes”. And though the MDL3040 application was currently a matter for the state government, it was a one upon which federal candidates should “make their position known”. Fox Resources was contacted for comment.",News/Australia news,Miner will ‘pursue all avenues’ to overturn rejection of coal exploration licence in Queensland,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/20/miner-will-pursue-all-avenues-to-overturn-rejection-of-coal-exploration-licence-in-queensland
4/20/2022,"Advocacy groups say sex workers in Queensland are being forced into dangerous situations due to “outdated” legislation that allows accommodation providers to discriminate against them. Under the state’s Anti-Discrimination Act (1991), landlords and accommodation providers can lawfully evict sex workers, refuse them housing or treat them “unfavourably” in any way in connection to accommodation, including by requiring them to pay higher rents or room fees. This discrimination can occur if a person “reasonably believes” a person is using or intends to use the accommodation for sex work. Respect Inc and DecrimQLD’s campaign manager, Janelle Fawkes, said the accommodation amendment has contributed to systemic vilification and exploitation of sex workers since it was introduced in 2012. She said sex workers have reported being evicted in the middle of the night, charged more for housing and billed random costs that have not been previously agreed upon. “We think there’s a direct relationship between housing instability for sex workers and the exemption in the Anti Discrimination Act,” said Fawkes. “Discrimination [of sex workers] is excessive. It’s very frequent and has a broad range of impacts.” A survey of 204 sex workers in the state by DecrimQLD showed 72.5% have experienced discrimination when it comes to accommodation, banking, policing, sexual harassment and healthcare. Of the sex workers who experienced discrimination in the same survey, only 9% reported it. This came after Victoria passed legislation decriminalising sex work earlier this year, which will make Queensland the only Australian jurisdiction that allows accommodation providers to discriminate against sex workers. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Advocates have expressed hope that this will change, with the Queensland Human Rights Commission undertaking a review of the state’s anti-discrimination laws. The review has received a number of submissions from sex workers. In one, a Brisbane sex worker says her landlord refused to extend her lease because she was working from home. “Even though all my rent and bills were up to date, I was forced to move home rather than be considered to stay,” she said. “I have seen friends and colleagues thrown out of accommodation just because a hotel receptionist took a dislike to them and used sex work as a reason for eviction.” A submission by Respect Inc and DecrimQld also quoted several sex workers, with one saying: “The manager of the body corporate threatened to tell the neighbours if I didn’t provide sex for free.” “I was denied rentals by hundreds of agents, I couldn’t possibly report them all,” another sex worker said. But state’s anti-discrimination laws don’t just target sex workers when it comes to accommodation. Another amendment of the act that has sparked outrage allows for the discrimination of sex workers, transgender, gender diverse and intersex people in work settings involving children. Fawkes called for these both of these amendments to be repealed. “There is no evidence to demonstrate either sex workers or someone based on their gender places children at risk,” Fawkes said. “[These] pieces of legislation are extremely outdated. They always would have been extremely poor policy but in 2022 they stand out as being particularly horrific.” Sex workers have reported being frequent targets of discrimination, with stigma affecting all aspects of their lives. To address this discrimination, Fawkes also wants the attribution of “lawful sexual activity” in the state’s anti-discrimination laws to be replaced with an attribute that covers all sex workers. Lawful sexual activity in Queensland refers to sex work in licensed brothels or those who work as sole operators visiting clients or working out of their own homes. As a result, Fawkes said many aspects of sex work were not “lawful” in Queensland. This includes practising basic safety strategies such as checking up on a colleague before and after a booking, or employing a receptionist. “The attribute ‘lawful sexual activity’ has proven to be extremely ineffective in providing anti-discrimination coverage for sex workers in Queensland,” Fawkes said. “A lot of sex workers experience discrimination. But if you want to report discrimination, the attribute has to be correct.” The Queensland Law Reform Commission is currently considering how to decriminalise sex work in the state, with its report due in November.",News/Australia news,"‘Forced to move home’: discrimination of Queensland sex workers needs to end, say advocates",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/20/forced-to-move-home-discrimination-of-queensland-sex-workers-needs-to-end-say-advocates
4/20/2022,"If you’ve watched TV at all over the past five decades, you will have spent time with Belinda Giblin. The soapie star has acted in classics such as Sons and Daughters, The Sullivans and Heartbreak High. In Home and Away, she has played not one but two different roles – first Cynthia Ross in the early 90s, then Martha Stewart, the long-presumed-dead wife of Alf, from 2018. Giblin grew up in Tamworth in the 1950s and began acting in the 70s after a year at the National Institute of Dramatic Art (Nida). She is still working today, currently preparing to star in the Griffin Theatre production Ghosting the Party, which runs from 6 May to 4 June in Sydney. It’s a pitch-black comedy in which Giblin plays an 87-year-old who decides her time has come, forcing three generations of family to face brutal questions about mortality. Ever since she was a teenager, Giblin has been a faithful keeper of journals. She now has six decades’ worth – a collection she would rush to save in a fire. Here, the actor tells us why those “jottings” are such a vital tool for self-reflection, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. I would be devastated if I couldn’t save the journals, diaries and jottings I have kept for the last 60 years, going back to my high school days. They are a record of my life, and range from family activities and musings about my life growing up in Tamworth to my time at school, university (in the period of the Vietnam war, moratorium marches and hippiedom!) and eventually Nida. There are volumes and volumes of my life as an actor – 50 years’ worth – first in radio drama, and then theatre, television and film. I also have musings about my experience of marriage and childbirth, my children and grandchildren, many trips overseas, my time as a corporate trainer and speech writer, and my experience with breast cancer, over 12 years ago now (all good – the trick is to catch it early). I occasionally look over them all and impress myself with what an optimistic and self-determining person I am. My handbag, of course! I could spend a week away and not need a suitcase. It’s amazing how much I can fit in there. My wallet, cards, keys, phone, four pairs of glasses, tissues, umbrella, toothbrush, toothpaste, a selection of masks, tablets, a myriad of pens and pencils, a tape measure, hair clips, lipstick, perfume, a cut-out SMH cryptic crossword, a comb, a scarf, dozens of business cards, prescriptions, theatre tickets, a magnet, addresses of people I can no longer remember, a mini screwdriver for broken glasses, several packets of Fisherman’s Friend and the script I am currently working on. I have kept a large dress-up box of costumes, all of which were made by my darling mother for the various ballet concerts I performed between the ages of five and 17. My son and daughter spent their childhood dressing up in them and now my grandchildren have discovered them – they come in handy for school dress-up days. Sadly, a beloved goblin costume seems to have disappeared. My husband and I did a massive house declutter after Christmas and threw half our possessions into a skip, along with, I suspect, this goblin outfit. I know it’s just a “thing”, but I’ve kept it for over 60 years, goddammit, and it drove my mother to tears making it!",Lifestyle/Life and style,Three things with Belinda Giblin: ‘What I most regret losing?

4/20/2022,"Labor appears to have lost ground in the opening week of the federal election campaign according to the latest Guardian Essential poll, but a majority of respondents still think Anthony Albanese will be Australia’s next prime minister. The latest survey of 1,020 respondents shows Labor’s standing in the two-party preferred “plus” measure is down three points in a fortnight, and there has been a two point increase in the number of undecided voters. But 55% of respondents believe Labor will win on 21 May. Voting intention figures, calculated by Guardian Essential, now express the head-to-head metric of the major party contest as two-party preferred “plus”, rather than the standard two-party preferred measure. This change in methodology, adopted after the 2019 election, highlights the proportion of undecided voters in any survey, providing accuracy on the limits of any prediction. In the latest survey, the Coalition’s primary vote is 37%, Labor 35%, the Greens 9%, One Nation 3%, independents and others 5% and United Australia party 4%. On the two-party preferred “plus” measure, Labor is on 47% (down three points in a fortnight), the Coalition on 46% (up one point) with 7% of respondents undecided (up two points). In the poll taken a fortnight ago, the Coalition’s primary vote was 37%, Labor 36%, the Greens 10%, independents and others were on 5%, the United Australia party 3% and Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party 4%. On the two-party preferred “plus” measure Labor was on 50% (up from 48%), the Coalition on 45% (up from 44%), with 5% of respondents undecided (down from 7%). Morrison is campaigning on the risks of a change of government in an uncertain environment while Albanese is telling voters he represents safe change. In responses to questions that test the salience of that messaging, just under half (48%) of respondents believe it is time for Morrison to go, while 34% say the Coalition deserves another turn. But 46% of respondents also believe Australia is currently going in the right direction, with 37% saying we are on the wrong track. Morrison’s approval with voters in the Guardian Essential sample has remained steady over the past fortnight, although the prime minister is still in negative territory. More voters disapprove of the prime minister (48%) than approve of him (44%), with 8% undecided. Albanese has taken more of a hit, with the Labor leader’s approval (41%) down two points in the fortnight. This is a negative movement inside the poll’s margin of error, which is plus or minus three points. But disapproval of the Labor leader has increased from 36% to 41%, which is a five point negative movement. A larger percentage of voters also remain undecided about the Labor leader (17% compared with Morrison’s 8%) although the trend suggests more voters are coming off the fence about Albanese (23% were undecided about him back in January). This latest data also suggests there is a gender gap when it comes to approval of the two leaders. Just over half of men in the sample (51%) approve or strongly approve of the job the prime minister is doing compared with 38% of female respondents. When it comes to Albanese, men also lead women when it comes to approval of his performance (45% to 38%) but women are significantly more likely to be undecided about the Labor leader (23% of women do not have a view, compared with 11% of male respondents). Morrison leads Albanese on the poll’s better prime minister metric 40% to 36%, with 24% of respondents still on the fence at the end of the second week of the campaign. Half of Guardian Essential respondents say they have been paying attention to developments on the hustings – although 15% of respondents report they are paying no attention at all. The latest survey suggests more voters trust Labor than the Coalition to manage the components of the caring economy – Medicare, childcare, aged care and the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Conversely, more voters think interest rates, debt and unemployment would be higher under a Labor government. But more voters also believe a Labor government would deliver higher wages and more significant cost of living relief. Both Morrison and Albanese have battled cross-currents in the opening sorties of the campaign. The Labor leader stumbled early, forgetting the unemployment rate and the official cash rate, while the prime minister has battled rolling controversy about his captain’s pick in the seat of Warringah, Katherine Deves, and a backlash about his refusal to revive a federal integrity commission in the next parliament unless Labor backs the Coalition’s model.",News/Australia news,Guardian Essential poll: Labor loses ground in first week of campaign but remains ahead of Coalition,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/20/guardian-essential-poll-labor-loses-ground-in-first-week-of-campaign-but-remains-ahead-of-coalition
4/20/2022,"The Australian Christian Lobby is targeting moderate Liberals who crossed the floor to strengthen protections in Scott Morrison’s religious discrimination package, distributing leaflets in their electorates showing a mocked-up image of MPs driving a wrecking ball into religious schools. Guardian Australia has seen new leaflets attacking Liberals Trent Zimmerman, who is in a fight to retain his seat of North Sydney; Dave Sharma, who is battling to hold the eastern suburbs seat of Wentworth; and Bridget Archer, who holds the most marginal Coalition seat in the country – Bass, in Tasmania. As well as the mocked-up image, the leaflets state the MPs “voted against protecting people of faith from discrimination” when the package was before the parliament in February. It also says the MPs “voted to remove laws that protect the values of faith-based schools”. The leaflets ask voters to consider whether these “attacks on Christianity and other faiths accord with your values”. Some constituents in these electorates are also reporting having been targeted by automated phone “push” polling highlighting the incumbents’ votes on the religious discrimination proposal. Back in February, five moderates – Archer, Zimmerman, Katie Allen, Fiona Martin and Dave Sharma – crossed the floor in an attempt to add protections for LGBTQ+ students to the Sex Discrimination Act. The eruption during the high-stakes parliamentary deliberation over religious discrimination followed the Morrison government revealing it would protect gay students from expulsion – but not other forms of discrimination – without protecting trans students at the same time. On Tuesday night Zimmerman told Guardian Australia he was disappointed but not surprised the ACL would target him electorally in this way. He said he was certain a majority of his constituents backed his stand. “As the son of a faith-based school principal I have a deep understanding of the role of faith-based schools,” Zimmerman said. “But I also have no regrets about standing up for gay students and teachers when I crossed the floor.” Archer said: “I stand by my decision to ensure Tasmania’s gold standard anti-discrimination laws remain intact.” “I have had further friendly and constructive discussions with Christian schools in northern Tasmania regarding my decision and I would welcome any discussion with the Australian Christian Lobby should they wish to reach out to me.” Sharma said: “The ACL attacks on me are misleading. I support the ability of faith-based schools to retain their faith-based character. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “But what I do not support is the ability of faith-based schools to discriminate against teachers and students solely on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity, as Citipointe Christian College sought to do, for instance. “Having consulted closely with faith leaders in Wentworth throughout this process, as well as the LGBTQI+ community, I am confident that this position represents that of the vast majority of the seat of Wentworth – a seat that overwhelmingly voted in favour of marriage equality,” Sharma said. He said if the ACL wanted to run a campaign against him “for staying true to my values and those of my community – good luck to them”. “The ACL’s doctrinaire views are not only wildly out of step with mainstream Australia, they are also at odds with the very Christian community they purport to represent,” he said. The fresh fracas over the leaflets comes as the prime minister is continuing to resist calls to dump the controversial Liberal candidate in Warringah, Katherine Deves. Deves’ candidacy is intensifying pressure on Liberal moderates facing off against teal independents in metropolitan seats. Guardian Australia reported on Monday that Zimmerman had contacted the prime minister’s office seeking her disendorsement. Christian lobby groups have used the election campaign to press both major parties to recommit to the unamended religious discrimination bill. In February Labor helped pass the religious discrimination bill in the lower house but, along with the five Liberal MPs who crossed the floor, added amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act to protect LGBTQ+ students. To prevent a second boil over from conservatives, Scott Morrison pulled the bill. Asked on the hustings last week if he would commit to reintroduce and pass the bill in the next term, the prime minister said his “views about protecting people against religious discrimination are well known and my credibility on those issues are not challenged or under question”.",News/Australia news,Australian Christian Lobby targets Liberal MPs who voted against religious discrimination laws,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/20/australian-christian-lobby-targets-liberal-mps-who-voted-against-religious-discrimination-laws
4/20/2022,"Aged care providers say the sector’s staffing crisis is so acute that services cannot be delivered to people relying on home care in some areas. The federal government last year pledged $6.5bn to fund an extra 80,000 home care packages to alleviate the huge unmet demand from Australia’s ageing population, after the royal commission warned of “unacceptable” delays. The new packages, largely welcomed by the sector, are being progressively released over two years to mid-2023. But the actual delivery of services approved and funded by the government is being compromised by ongoing staffing shortages. Aged and Community Services Australia, an industry peak group, says it has received anecdotal reports that staff shortages in home care are now so severe that services simply cannot be provided to some people entitled to care in their own home. “Aged care was already suffering a serious workforce shortage and low wages prior to the pandemic. Attracting home care and other aged care workers has become even more difficult through the pressures of the past two years,” Acsa’s chief executive, Paul Sadler, said. That accords with comments from the largest home care provider, myHomecare Group, who told Guardian Australia that the sector’s “abysmal” turnover and staffing shortages were compromising less urgent services to home care recipients. The latest government data shows that, despite the new funding, the total number of home care providers has actually decreased in the past year, down 1.8%, or 17 providers. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The data also shows 68,429 people had been approved for a home care package but are still waiting for that package to be provided at the level they were approved for. That is a reduced, but still significant, number of people who are in need that are not receiving adequate home care services. ADA Australia, a Queensland-based advocacy service for older Australians, said it was receiving complaints about delays to the rollout of new home care packages and about the difficulty in attracting and retaining staff for providers. Chief executive Geoff Rowe said earning a living wage in home care was a much more complex proposal, given the nature of the work, which required multiple blocks of a small number of hours of care. “Potentially in some areas, it’s not as big a problem as others, but once you step out of large metropolitan areas, it becomes more and more complex,” he told the Guardian. “That said, we are also hearing that within metropolitan areas that people are experiencing that same difficulty in recruiting and retaining staff.” Ian Yates, head of the Council on the Ageing, said last week that, while the delivery of the government’s promised 80,000 packages was on schedule, the ability to actually deliver servicesvaried across different regions. “It’s patchy … Several months ago we were getting a lot of reports out of Queensland, that people couldn’t find a provider, and regional areas is a challenge at the best of times,” he said. Whichever party wins the next election must prioritise “the creation and training of an Australian workforce via real wage increases and training to assist people into aged care,” Sadler said. “Recent analysis from Australian Aged Care Collaboration shows too many in the aged care workforce are on the brink of the poverty line, with wages for aged care workers having failed to keep up with the cost of living.” A spokesperson for Richard Colbeck, the aged care minister, said the workforce had grown by 15,000 since the start of November and “continues to increase”. The government provided $338.5m to expand, train and upskill the aged care workforce in the last budget. “While Labor has offered nothing on home care – the Morrison Government is investing in aged care workforce initiatives that attract and retain a diverse range of workers with the right skills, knowledge and attributes to work and pursue a career in aged care,” a spokesperson said. “Initiatives include place-based approaches targeting local workers and national projects.” The spokesperson also said the decrease of providers overall, reflected in the latest data on home care, was due to the strategic acquisition of providers under the umbrella of larger organisations. “Importantly, [the] latest quarterly Home Care Program (HCP) data reveals the number of providers delivering care and services has actually increased from 820 (31 December 2020) to 844 (31 December 2021),” the spokesperson said. Sadler said the industry would be working on a home care workforce recruitment, training and retention program with the federal government. “A credible workforce plan from government also needs to ensure people remain working in home care have an ongoing commitment to fair pay and conditions, training and skills development and opportunity for career progression,” he said. Meanwhile, in residential care, workers across five providers have voted to take industrial action, raising the prospect of strikes during the election campaign. The United Workers Union said on Tuesday that the providers collectively employed 7,000 workers who had voted overwhelmingly to take industrial action. Three more ballots are due in the next week. “They are sick of propping up a broken system,” UWU aged care director Carolyn Smith said. “They are sick of their hard work not quite making up for the chronic understaffing in the system, so they are physically and emotionally exhausted by never really giving the quality of care that they know the people they are looking after deserve.”",News/Australia news,Home care packages delayed as staff shortages ravage aged care sector,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/20/home-care-packages-delayed-as-staff-shortages-ravage-aged-care-sector
4/20/2022,"The boss of collapsed company Bulb Energy has been criticised for continuing to draw a £250,000 salary, funded by UK taxpayers. Once the seventh-biggest energy supplier, Bulb was effectively nationalised in November 2021 after collapsing amid the surge in global energy prices. That left the taxpayer with a potential bill of up to £3bn, making it the biggest state bailout since the collapse of the Royal Bank of Scotland in 2008. Speaking at a hearing before MPs, the chief executive and co-founder Hayden Wood apologised for the “way things turned out with Bulb”. Bulb was placed into a rare “special administration”, giving it access to government funds to keep it supplying gas and electricity to its 1.7 million household customers. Wood, who had provided management consultancy to the energy sector before he co-founded Bulb Energy, said: “My salary now in the last year is £250,000 a year.” He added that the administrators for “both Bulb and Simple [Bulb’s parent company] asked me to stay on to help. The reason I stayed on was because we wanted to support customers [and] have a smooth transition into special administration. “The things we are doing within the company is to try and minimise costs for consumers, minimise costs for taxpayers, and hopefully effect a sale of the company out of special administration to again reduce costs for government.” However, the Labour MP Andy McDonald, a member of the business select committee, asked whether it was “morally justifiable” for taxpayers to be paying his £250,000 salary. Wood responded: “I think everything we are doing right now is to try and complete a sale of the company so that we can minimise the cost to taxpayers and minimise the disruption to consumers.” But McDonald said it was “staggering” that he was continuing to get paid “the same salary that you were pre-collapse”. Wood said he had put “all his personal savings since 2015” into the company, which he founded in that same year with Amit Gudka. He said it had been an “extremely challenging time” for the energy market. Charlotte Nichols, a Labour MP and committee member, quoted the former chief executive of Ofgem, Dermot Nolan, who said “for Bulb to blame anybody but themselves for its collapse is not reasonable”. Wood said: “I completely agree. We at Bulb should take responsibility for how the business failed.” He added: “Lessons will need to be learned and I hope that is what we can do.” McDonald told the Guardian: “It is staggering that the chief executive of Bulb Energy continues to receive a salary of £250,000 a year at the taxpayers’ expense. “There is no justification for Hayden Wood drawing such an enormous salary, particularly given the disastrous mismanagement of the company, which has led to the government bringing the company into public ownership, and is set to cost of the taxpayer as much as £3bn. “The secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy must step in and put an end to this outrageous case of corporate welfare.” A BEIS spokesperson said: “Bulb’s administrators have agreed to keep Mr Wood temporarily in place to ensure a smooth handover and sales process. “Mr Wood is paid for this work under his employment contract with Simple Energy, the parent company of Bulb, in a separate administration process over which the government has no influence. “The special administrator of Bulb remains legally obligated to keep costs of the administration process as low as possible. The government will seek to recoup costs at a later date, ensuring that we get maximum value for money for taxpayers.”",News/Business,"Boss of collapsed Bulb Energy criticised for £250,000 salary funded by taxpayers",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/boss-of-collapsed-company-bulb-energy-criticised-for-250000-salary
4/20/2022,"A theatre show that promised to reimagine sex education by discussing the issue in a frank and open manner with audience members as young as five years old has been cancelled after “violent threats” were made against its organisers. The Family Sex Show was due to tour this spring but was pulled from venues after what its creators called a series of “violent and illegal threats and abuse” were directed at the company and venues by “a small group of people with extremist views”. The show had been in development by Josie Dale-Jones since 2017 and promised to confront subjects including boundaries, gender, relationships and masturbation in a production aimed at families that included some nudity. After the show was announced and news of its content began circulating online, a petition was started, which claimed the production was “wholly inappropriate and is a blatant attempt to sexualise children and break down their natural boundaries”. ThisEgg, the company behind the production, said in a statement that audiences were given information about the content before booking, so could make an “informed decision” about the show. An online comment piece for The Critic magazine claimed The Family Sex Show could lead to inappropriate conversations between children and adults about sex and “is creating a gap, nay, a canyon, for predators to enter”. The Guardian understands threatening and abusive calls and communications were sent to the venues hosting the show and ThisEgg, which led on 14 April to the cancellation of the performances. The show had been due to visit the Tobacco Factory in Bristol and the Norfolk & Norwich festival in May, but just an invite-only date in Bath remains, “ahead of subsequent public performances in the future”. Made in collaboration with Outspoken Sex Ed and the School of Sexuality Education, the production would have offered free family workshops before the performances, which included sex educators available to answer questions. There was also a spin-off podcast. The company added it would have offered “safe and positive learning to children, young people and guardians about rights, bodies, sex and relationships, advised by safeguarding and educational specialists”. Its statement said: “We believe that what has happened is reflective of structural and societal attitudes towards relationships and sex education as well as art, culture and who is allowed to create and what we are allowed to engage with in the UK.” In an interview with the Guardian in early March, Dale-Jones discussed the possibility of a backlash. “We know we will get people who don’t want it to happen,” she said. “There aren’t many of them, but they shout loudly. The main thing is looking after the company, the venues, their staff and the audiences.” ThisEgg said its creative team would continue to work on the showso it was “ready for a time it might be able to meet a public”. It also apologised to those who had bought tickets and said it wanted to respond to “the events of the last few weeks”. “Removing work that celebrates freedom of expression from stages cannot be the answer,” it added.",Arts/Stage,Sex education theatre show for children cancelled after ‘violent threats’,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/19/sex-education-theatre-show-children-cancelled-violent-threats
4/20/2022,"The death of the twin son of Cristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez during childbirth, which they announced on Monday, has been met with worldwide sympathy. But experts say there is still very little public perception of the devastating impact of stillbirth, neonatal death, miscarriage and medical termination on parents, as well as their families and friends. What most parents who have lost a baby want and need is to hear their baby’s name spoken. However, the loss of a baby is so rarely discussed in society today that it is virtually taboo, say bereavement councillors, leaving parents alienated instead of supported. “While parents’ lives are irrevocably changed by the loss of their newborn, even those inside the bereaved family can end up saying the wrong thing,” said Jen Coates, director of the bereavement support charity Sands. “Anything that begins with ‘At least’ is usually incredibly unhelpful and hurtful. This can be a particular issue with twin loss where one twin dies and another lives. There is no ‘At least’: their baby died and that’s devastating.” Nicky Rygielski, a trustee of Sophia Pregnancy Loss Support, agreed. “When a baby dies at any stage of gestation, their parents’ lives are irrevocably changed. Their longed-for baby will never be ‘replaced’ regardless of how many children they may go on to have in the future. If you are supporting a bereaved parent, don’t be afraid to talk about their loss. Help them to find a new normal, which includes their lost little one.”​ If, as in Ronaldo and Rodríguez’s case, there is a surviving twin, that makes for a particularly difficult grieving, said Sharon Darke, a bereavement support coordinator at Twins Trust, who lost her twin boys 22 years ago. “You’ve got the joy of the twin who is alive and doing well alongside the absolute devastation of the twin who died,” she said. “How do you cope with those parallels?”. In 2020, there were 2,231 stillbirths and 733 deaths of babies born at 24 weeks in England and Wales, a rate of 2.7 deaths for every 1,000 live births that has stayed stable since 2016. “The loss of a baby is a unique experience but differs from the normal grief felt when we lose a close friend or relative,” said Amy Jackson, a co-founder of the Lily Mae Foundation, named after the daughter she lost in 2010 as a newborn. “We don’t grieve a life that has passed where that individual has fulfilled so much. We grieve a lifetime of a missed opportunity and memories that we planned to make with our baby.” When Jackson left hospital after the birth and death of Lily Mae, she left “with nothing but a broken heart and our small, but precious memories”. Her charity now helps parents create a memory box to store precious items. “As a parent you want to protect your child; when you lose a child, you want and need to protect their memory,” she said. “By providing parents with a starting point and ideas we will hopefully make the hard task of memory making that bit easier and give them something beautiful to look back on and remember their child by.” Ben Moorhouse, a co-founder of the Kallipateira Moorhouse Foundation who lost his newborn daughter at birth, said that while his “shock will last a lifetime with hourly grief”, the pain can be overlooked. “It is the highest form of devastation and heartbreak you can experience,” he said. “But as a dad I was treated very differently to my wife. I was expected to be strong. Even now people think I’m OK when I’m not: dads are too often forgotten about.” Grandparents and siblings, too, can be forgotten: “Grandparents are not only grieving the death of a grandchild but also their child’s pain at losing a baby,” said Coates, adding: “Younger siblings will ‘puddle jump’ in and out of grief because they can’t sustain those sad feelings and may need to focus on other things for a while.”",News/Society,‘Just devastating’: the rarely discussed virtual taboo of losing a baby,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/19/just-devastating-the-rarely-discussed-virtual-taboo-of-losing-a-baby-cristiano-ronaldo-georgina-rodriguez
