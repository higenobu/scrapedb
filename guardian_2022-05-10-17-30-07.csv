5/10/2022,"The One Nation candidate preferenced by the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, in his regional New South Wales electorate is a salesman from inner-city Brisbane. Joyce has directed preferences in his ultra-safe New England seat to One Nation, telling a candidate’s forum on Monday night that the far-right party had changed. “The party of 10, 15 years ago is not the party of today,” he said at the forum. “Things change. Mollify.” Almost nothing is known about One Nation’s candidate in the seat, Richard Thomas. He did not respond to the invitation to attend the candidate forum and didn’t provide a photo for its promotional material. He is also not listed as a candidate on the party’s website. Held in the regional NSW town of Tamworth, the forum would have been quite a drive for Thomas. The Guardian has confirmed that he lives in West End, a trendy inner-city suburb on the Brisbane River, which is about seven hours’ drive away from the electorate from New England. A spokesperson for One Nation said that Thomas lived in Queensland, but was unable to provide any biographical details, other than that he worked in “sales”. There is no requirement for candidates to live in the division that they are contesting. The Guardian had previously revealed One Nation has a series of candidates in the federal election who live thousands of kilometres from the seats they are running in. After it committed to running candidates in all 151 electorates before the election, the party was still scrambling to find candidates just hours before nominations closed last month. It told one prospective candidate to leave the electorate he was running in “blank” on his form, saying the party didn’t “require you to do anything or campaign at all”. The party’s candidates include a husband and wife running in separate seats in NSW and Victoria, and a resident of regional Queensland running in the inner-west Sydney seat of Grayndler.

During Monday night’s forum, Joyce declined to say whether he had spoken to Thomas before directing his preferences to the candidate. He explained the decision to preference One Nation by saying: “If I see … those decisions about a party’s platform are less likely to cause damage to my nation, then they are further up [the preferences].” The Guardian has attempted to contact Joyce.",News/Australia news,Barnaby Joyce directs New England preferences to One Nation candidate living in Brisbane,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/barnaby-joyce-directs-new-england-preferences-to-one-nation-candidate-living-in-brisbane
5/10/2022,"The policing minister, Kit Malthouse, has said if Keir Starmer were to resign over an alleged breach of lockdown rules it does not automatically mean the prime minister should do the same. In a statement on Monday, the Labour leader said he would do the “right thing” if he was issued with a fixed-penalty notice in relation to a gathering in Labour offices in Durham in April last year. The move has been viewed as a huge gamble, with Starmer placing his future in the hands of Durham police after it was announced last week officers would reopen an investigation into the event at which he drank beer and ate a takeaway curry. However, Labour sources have said they are confident they can prove it was a work event and that those present were taking a break to eat while working late on preparations for the Hartlepool byelection. The Guardian revealed Labour has compiled time-stamped logs of WhatsApp chats, documents and video edits – which it will provide to Durham police for their investigation. Asked on LBC if Johnson should follow suit if the Labour leader was issued with a penalty and does resign, Malthouse, a longtime ally of Boris Johnson, said: “Not necessarily, no.” He told LBC: “Obviously in any situation where, you know, the rules were moving around, there were misunderstandings or mistakes were made, and apologies are made and they are accepted, then people of all walks of life should be able to keep their jobs. But Keir Starmer has to speak for himself and set his own standards.” Starmer’s critics have suggested he is attempting to put pressure on Durham police as the force would not want to be seen as in effect ending his tenure as Labour leader. Malthouse told Sky News the police force would meet “high standards” regardless of any alleged pressure. “Durham police will operate professionally to the high standards we expect of them irrespective of what the external goings-on are around this case,” he said. “We need to leave them the space and time to do their job.” Lord Ken Macdonald – a former director of public prosecutions like Starmer – has said the suggestion Durham police would be pressured in their investigation was “wide of the mark”. The crossbench peer told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “My experience of working with the police in very sensitive cases under full glare of public and press interest was that, very quickly, you find your focus taking over and, in a sense, a sort of bloody-mindedness creeps in: ‘this is my case and I’ll decide it, thank you very much, without any help from you’.” In his statement on Mondah, Starmer said repeatedly no rules had been broken as he sought to contrast his actions with those of Johnson, who has refused to quit after being issued with a fixed-penalty notice by the Metropolitan police over a gathering in No 10 in June 2020 to mark his 56th birthday. But having called called for Johnson to go for breaking the law, many at Westminster believed Starmer would have no choice but to fall on his sword if he was found to have done so himself. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, who was also present at the Durham event, has said she too would stand down if she is issued with a penalty notice.",News/Politics,"PM should not have to copy any Starmer resignation, says minister",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/boris-johnson-should-not-have-to-copy-any-keir-starmer-resignation-says-minister
5/10/2022,"Valzhyna Mort was born in Minsk, Belarus, moved to the US in 2005 and now teaches at Cornell University. She speaks three languages: English, Belarusian and Russian and wrote Music for the Dead and Resurrected in Belarusian and English versions. She recently claimed in an interview not to be at home in any of her languages, but reading the English poems, I find this hard to believe. I read her exceptional collection with the excitement you feel on encountering a poised new voice. The opening pieces each contain the words “Self-Portrait” in their titles but this collection is more about what happens when the self goes missing, buried beneath the Minsk snow that falls in poem after poem, muffled by a regime in which it is not safe to speak. The opening prose poem begins: “I grew up in a microregion of apartment blocks on the south-western edge of the capital city in a provincial Soviet republic…” The sentence continues at length, enjoying its own bulk, and the second begins: “A long sentence, yes, but so was my apartment building, stretching for two bus stops, twelve entrances long and eleven floors high.” Her humour proves a wild and winning card in the pack. She goes on to describe, deadpan, the grim view from the family apartment on to the state dental clinic below and blood on the snow (an image that takes in more than dental trauma). She declares: “Minsk has four distinct seasons; each is its own country.” But in her poetry, it seems that winter never ends. She describes streets “with the names of national murderers”. She alludes to the mass executions in Belarus, in the 1930s, under Stalin. The word “history” is unstable whenever it appears. How to situate herself against a past that never officially happened? An Attempt at Genealogy opens: “Where am I from?” The question is repeated (repetition is her forte). But writing about self-erasure is not the same as being erased – it is a form of resistance. Many words and images come back to haunt her – and us. Blood on snow, speechlessly open mouths, bones… this sometimes seems an ossuary of a collection. In another splendid prose poem, Baba Bronya, we are introduced to an aunt who turns out, entertainingly, to have been living, without Mort’s knowledge, in their second bedroom. She is, understandably, freaked out to find this “total stranger inside our apartment”. Meanwhile, her grandmother appears in a starring role, never afraid of narrating her past. Whenever Mort complains of her lot, her grandmother trumps her: “When I beg for privacy, you ask: ‘Did I tell you about the day the Bolsheviks came to take the roof off our farmhouse?’” It was her grandmother who visited music upon her – she was “drafted” into playing the accordion. Like humour, music – or the idea of music – is important in the poems because it rises above restrictions, has a diplomatic immunity. She had no talent for it, she maintains. Mort’s tendency towards charming self-disparagement is ever-present – it is in the breezily sad Poet’s Biography, the superb To Antigone, a Dispatch and Genesis. She sympathises with Antigone’s sister, Ismene, and, in Genesis, with Cain – the compromised ones. She shows how compromise operates within a despotic regime: art, literature and biblical texts are repurposed in the Belarusian context. In Self-Portrait with Madonna on Pravda Avenue, she has an acute take on Raphael’s painting: “In this starched light, on Madonna’s chest / the child already looked crucified, / the nailhead of the nipple next to his little fist” – a contaminated nativity in a collection of brilliance. I picked your book from Sandeep’s shelf;the poet’s biography read: “lives and teaches.”Though the book was fairly recent, it was no longer true. I almost met you once – an almost meeting I remember clearlybecause of my embarrassment:I was having loud sex in a hotel roomwhile you stood knocking at the door wanting to give me your book. Now the trains stand frozen in a winter storm,and I pity the trainsas if they were shivering butterflies,a whole herd of them, the last of their kind,stuck in the snow England has never seen.

5/10/2022,"The thirst for gold has long been a force of evil in cinema, and the latest action piece from stuntman turned director Jesse V Johnson falls under its glittering spell, interweaving vicious greed with the wreckages of war. Set during the second world war, Hell Hath No Fury revolves around a coveted sack of stolen Nazi gold, its location known only to SS general Von Bruckner (Daniel Bernhardt) and his French lover Marie (Nina Bergman). As the war rapidly marches towards its conclusion, the once radiant Marie is punished by her compatriots for consorting with the enemy. With her hair chopped off and a swastika marked on her forehead in red lipstick, Marie cuts a Joan of Arc-like figure; it will soon be revealed that her relationship with Von Bruckner is not what it seems. Rescued from her ordeal by a ragtag group of American soldiers, Marie finds the price of freedom dangling by a thread, as she is ordered to lead her saviours to the buried treasure. By ingeniously setting much of the ensuing violence in Marie’s family cemetery, the film lends an earthy grittiness to its small-scale spectacle. Here, the air smells of death, as bullets whiz over graves while blood and dirt fuse into one grimy whole. Johnson’s skill for visual rhythm falters somewhat during the larger set pieces, but Bergman’s fierce, commanding presence proves to be the emotional anchor that elevates the grindhouse flavour to a bleak parable on the destructive power of greed. The decision to portray American soldiers not as heroes but rather as fallible, predatory beings is also an interesting subversion that suggests, when one is faced with the basest of desires, righteous ideology carries little weight.  Hell Hath No Fury is available on digital platforms on 16 May.",Arts/Film,Hell Hath No Fury review – cleverly choreographed violence in a search for Nazi loot ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/10/hell-hath-no-fury-review-cleverly-choreographed-violence-in-a-search-for-nazi-loot
5/10/2022,"The podcaster Deborah James has told followers on social media she does not know “how long I’ve got left” after being moved to hospice at home care to treat her terminal bowel cancer. The presenter of the BBC podcast You, Me And The Big C said the last six months had been “heartbreaking” to go through, but that she had been surrounded by “so much love” and had “no regrets”. James was diagnosed with the condition in 2016 and since then has kept her nearly 300,000 Instagram followers up to date with her treatments, progress and diagnosis. On 14 December 2021, she marked five years since her diagnosis, writing on Instagram: “I’m fully aware I shouldn’t be alive to write this today.” But in a new post on Monday, she said: “The message I never wanted to write. We have tried everything, but my body simply isn’t playing ball. “My active care has stopped and I am now moved to hospice at home care, with my incredible family all around me and the focus is on making sure I’m not in pain and spending time with them. “Nobody knows how long I’ve got left but I’m not able to walk, I’m sleeping most of the days, and most things I took for granted are pipe dreams.” She added that she had left “no stone unturned” in search of treatment, but that even a “magic new breakthrough” would not make a difference. The former deputy headteacher announced in her post that she was setting up the Bowelbabe Fund, and shared links to charities including Cancer Research UK, Bowel Cancer UK and the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity. Her JustGiving page had raised close to £850,000 by Tuesday morning. She wrote: “All I ask, if you ever read a column, followed my Instagram, listened to the podcast or saw me dressed as a poo for no reason, please buy me a drink to see me out this world, by donating the cost to @bowelbabefund which will enable us to raise funds for further lifesaving research into cancer. To give more Deborahs more time!” She added: “Right now for me it’s all about taking it a day at a time, step by step and being grateful for another sunrise. My whole family are around me and we will dance through this together, sunbathing and laughing (I’ll cry!!) at every possible moment! “You are all incredible, thank you for playing your part in my journey.

5/10/2022,"British Gas is to beef up its customer services team to deal with the sharp rise in the number of distressed customers who are struggling to cope with soaring bills, as its owner, Centrica, predicted annual profits will hit the top end of expectations. The company is to recruit another 500 people to field calls from the growing number of people who are facing higher energy bills at a time when the wider cost of living is outpacing wage growth, piling pressure on household budgets. A spokesperson for Centrica said demand for customer services had been “phenomenal” over the past year. “We’re taking on extra employees to manage that demand,” they said. “Customers are very concerned about rising energy costs and we want to help them as much as we can.” The average household dual fuel tariff jumped to just under £2,000 a year on 1 April, when the UK’s energy regulator raised the price cap by 54% to reflect sky-high wholesale gas prices. Bills are poised to rise further at the next energy price cap review in October. Centrica said in a trading statement on Tuesday that it expected 2022 operating profits to come at the top end of City forecasts, which range from £739m to £1.4bn. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been heavily criticised for not doing enough to help low-income households, and calls for a windfall tax on energy producers such as BP and Shell have intensified after they made billions in profits on the back of higher oil and gas prices. Centrica has also beefed up the British Gas energy support fund, set up in December, which has tripled in value since then to £6m. It provides grants of up to £750 to help vulnerable customers pay their energy bills. The fund has paid out £1.9m to 3,600 customers so far, equating to an average grant of £534. A further £1.6m of grants is pending. Centrica is will create a further 1,000 engineering apprenticeships after 500 were set up last year, with the goal of taking on 3,500 over the next decade. It said supply chain disruption, with global delays of shipments of some parts, and higher inflation was affecting the British Gas services arm. However, its British nuclear and gas production business is performing strongly, and it has secured more supplies of gas from Norway and renewable energy – mainly wind and solar – from across Europe and within the UK.",News/Business,British Gas to hire 500 staff to help people who face soaring bills,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/10/british-gas-staff-soaring-bills-centrica-energy-profits
