Does he mean real dogs or is that code for MI5 operatives in the field? Queries later. National emergency now. Uber-quiffed maverick espionage hero in improbably well-tailored suit vaults barriers, shoves civilians who get in his way, pins down suspect on the asphalt while bystanders, counterintuitively, don’t film the scene for their Instagram. Is that an apple in the suspect’s carry-on – or explosives? The former. Damn! MI5 has got the wrong man. “You said Asian male. Blue shirt. White T,” complains our hero, River Cartwright, played by Jack Lowden, to his co-working nemesis, “Spider” Webb, played by Freddie Fox. “No, I said ‘White shirt blue T’,” says Spider who, because he has slicked-back, oleaginous hair and wears braces, clearly can’t be trusted.

On the platform, the new suspect stands smiling even though he is now in our hero’s crosshairs. Detonates device? Check. Screen dissolves to white? Check. Three-figure death toll? You’d think. Scott Thomas’s lips? Incredibly pursed. And so it begins. Another spy drama, like the recent Ipcress File but more now and, disappointingly, featuring no leopardskin pillbox hats. Slow Horses (Apple TV+) is adapted from Mick Herron’s sardonic spy franchise about disgraced spooks banished to a dump called Slough House (think: Sandra Oh’s office in series one of Killing Eve) for drunkenness, lechery, sociopathy and incompetence. We’ve all worked in that office, am I right? “Another day dawns,” says Gary Oldman as head of Slough House’s loser brigade, “on MI fucking useless.” Oldman plays Jackson Lamb, a washed-up case who farts himself awake on his office sofa each morning before tackling the leading business of the day: another hangover. On the plus side, he must save on alarm clocks. Have you ever farted yourself awake? Try it. You’ll never need caffeine again. I’m not saying Scott Thomas and Oldman could have phoned their performances as jaded spies in from their respective poolsides, or that the storyline could have been sketched on a spreadsheet, printed out and left in a dead drop in Regent’s Park for the director, but deja vu is my primary experience of Slow Horses. Scott Thomas’s eyebrows, the rest of her lemon-sucking froideur and Oldman’s world-weary shtick ought to be modules at Rada, if they aren’t already. At least when Oldman played George Smiley 11 years ago in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, he was dapper even in his world weariness, whereas here he has holes in socks and what looks like last night’s dinner on his tie. I imagine Putin’s FSB lickspittles will see this tale of their British equivalents’ incompetence as funnier than Johnny English. But MI5 may well have the last laugh: after all, it’s possible that British TV and cinema is part of a vast misdirection industry that represents our spies as blundering boobs or self-involved martini shakers obsessed with intercontinental legovers. In reality, our spies could be saving Blighty from Johnny Foreigner 24/7. Of course they could. It turns out that the Stansted incident was a training exercise that our maverick rookie hero failed miserably. As a result, River (his mum was a hippy) has been banished to Slough House to be tormented by Oldman’s old farts, while shuffling towards pensionable age like his sad colleagues in their unacceptable knitwear. But, of course, that’s not what happens. Instead, River stumbles across a thumb drive belonging to a sleazy blowhard hack (modelled, most likely, on me) containing loony rightwing conspiracy theories. Our hero connects this find to the recent kidnapping of a Leeds University student by the Sons of Albion, who are not, sadly, West Brom fans, but white-pride morons striving to keep Britain British by, without any irony, emulating Islamic State videos. These plums now threaten to behead the student, ostensibly for an offensive standup comedy routine (which puts Chris Rock’s punishment slap into chastening context). Only our hero, possibly with Sid, the glamorous spy with whom I’ll bet he has a snog during episode three, can redeem his career and British espionage’s reputation. Mood? Tense. Genre? Hokum. Script?

This thriller, shot in a striking range of colour palettes, features Robin Williams in arguably his best performance. He plays Sy, a technician at a photo kiosk who prints snaps for the public, including Connie Nielsen’s Nina. Loner Sy idolises Nina’s seemingly perfect family – he stalks them by making furtive copies of her prints – so when he discovers a dark secret about them his vicarious pleasure is shattered.

4/1/2022,"One month after Ranelle Rose Bennett disappeared, agents from the Bureau of Indian Affairs Office of Justice Services’ newly created missing and murdered unit (MMU) arrived at her house on the Navajo Reservation. Her mother, Rose Yazzie, had initially reported the 33-year-old missing to Navajo Nation police after Bennett hadn’t shown up to her daughter’s 10th birthday party in June 2021 but said it took over a week for an officer to even file a missing report. So, when the federal agents appeared, she said she remembers feeling hopeful that this could be the turning point for finally finding her daughter. They searched the house, she recalls, removing some things for evidence, and then promised to be in touch. For three long months she waited. In October, with still no updates, Yazzie called one of the agents. She said he told her he was waiting on the Navajo Nation police before he could move forward with the investigation. Frustrated, Yazzie called the Navajo Nation police, but she said they told her they were waiting on the MMU to get back to them. The Navajo Nation Police did not respond to requests for comment for this article. “They could have found something by now, instead of just back and forth,” she said. “They’re probably not even doing anything.” One year after the US Department of the Interior announced it was launching a new investigative unit to prioritize the crisis of missing and murdered Native Americans, at least nine Indigenous families have watched jurisdictional issues and miscommunication hamper efforts by the unit to investigate their relatives’ cases, or been met with months of silence when requesting an investigation or even a 10-minute phone call with agents, records and interviews show. Announced by Deb Haaland, the first Indigenous cabinet secretary in US history, the unit was expected to investigate missing and murdered cases, building on the work by Operation Lady Justice, a presidential taskforce launched in 2019 that was criticized by some as being vague and uninformed. The unit was also designed to boost overall collaboration with such agencies as the FBI forensic laboratory and the US Marshals missing child unit. In a statement last year, Haaland, an enrolled member of the Pueblo of Laguna, said the MMU “will provide the resources and leadership to prioritize these cases and coordinate resources to hold people accountable, keep our communities safe, and provide closure for families”. In 2021, the National Crime Information Center listed over 9,500 Indigenous people as missing, with 1,554 of those cases still active by the end of the year. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that homicide was the third leading cause of death for Native females ages one to 19 years old, and the sixth for those ages 20 to 44. But at the time of publication, the MMU website featured 11 cases, only one of which was a homicide victim. Darlene Gomez, an attorney who represents the Bennett family along with a number of other Indigenous families with a missing or murdered relative, said none have received help from the unit. She said she has reached out to the unit for help on three cases. “Those people are angry,” she said. “If you ask them, they’ll tell you if they could give this unit an F, they would give them an F,” she said. “Other people you talk to, other families that have cases in the media, they don’t even know about this unit.” She explained that she doesn’t blame the individual investigators, but rather the policies and procedures put in place by politicians with little understanding of the jurisdictional issues at play. “There’s nothing in statute [that] says they shall exist or shall take over these cases,” she said. “You’re just depending on that sovereign nation to work with you together to implement these policies that the BIA murdered missing unit has implemented on paper.” She added: “It looks good on paper. It was good-willed. It was a great idea but the reality of it, they didn’t realize the true reality.” --- Braven Glenn, a Crow citizen, had just turned 17 years old when he died following a high-speed chase with the Crow tribal police force in November 2020, according to Mary Kathryn Nagle, a lawyer representing the family. The Montana state medical examiner ruled his death an accident, stating that it was the result of Glenn colliding with a train after “attempting to evade police”. But the family said it hadn’t received any details about why he was chased onto a train track, as the police force shut down just after Glenn’s death. Glenn’s brother, Gavin Old Bull, said he traveled to the scene the morning after the crash and noticed two additional tire tracks intertwined with his brother’s vehicle. “To me, it felt like they pushed him off the road and tried to stop him and pushed him on to the tracks … Because right before it goes on the [train] tracks, their tracks stop and they back out and leave,” he said. Witnesses to the aftermath of the crash have since come forward to say there were no ambulances on scene and that Glenn was crying out for help as law enforcement officers stood by. The Guardian made several attempts to contact the Crow tribe for comment. Nagle sent a letter to the MMU on 6 December 2021 requesting that they investigate Glenn’s death. In an email shared with the Guardian, an agent from the unit responded one month later, saying they had decided to refer the case to the FBI in Billings, Montana, since “Color of Law/Civil Rights investigations fall under the jurisdiction of the FBI. That would include deaths caused by law enforcement action.” But when Nagle followed up with the FBI, she said an agent told her they did not have a case on Glenn and did not receive a case file from the MMU. The FBI declined to comment, saying they “cannot confirm nor deny the existence of investigations.” “I thought that’s what they were here for,” said Blossom Old Bull, Glenn’s mother. “I thought that’s why they developed this, was for them to listen to us. And it’s like we’re still being ignored.” Nagle, who specializes in federal Indian law and appellate litigation, has contacted the MMU about five additional cases that she said haven’t received a thorough investigation by the associated law enforcement agency. But after dozens of emails, she said the MMU had yet to agree to formally investigate any of them. “Our assumption was if we go to people who care deeply about this issue they’ll do something about it,” she said. “That hasn’t been the case so far, but we’re still hopeful, I guess.” The impact the unit has had over its inaugural year is difficult to pinpoint. When asked how many cases the agency has solved or to detail the work that has been done or to respond to the issues families have described facing with the unit, The Guardian received no response. However, it’s clear it has made a difference for Vangie Randall-Shorty, whose 23-year-old son Zachariah Shorty was shot to death in July 2020 on the Navajo reservation. For months, she said she had felt like the investigation, handled by the FBI and Navajo Nation, was stalled. Then, in February, she approached an MMU unit chief, during a missing and murdered Indigenous women’s walk at the New Mexico state capitol. She said a week later he had assigned an agent. Days later she was talking with the agent and in early March he traveled out to her home and spent hours asking her about her son. “Having the missing and murdered unit take the time to reach out, I’m grateful, I’m thankful,” she said. “It makes me feel like, not only myself, but Zachariah, makes me feel like, you know, he was somebody and they understand that part of it.” But, she said, the agent told her that it was not a guarantee that the MMU will be able to assist with the case, as it was up to the FBI and Navajo Nation. The status of her son’s case is unclear, and as of publication had yet to be featured on the unit’s website. --- For nine long months, Keith Gourneau, a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, has waited for a meeting with the MMU. In 2001, his oldest son, Clint James Gourneau was 17 years old when he died after Keith Gourneau said he and his cousin were pushed down an elevator shaft in an abandoned building in North Dakota on land that is now trust property of the Turtle Mountain Tribe. Dustin Delonais, his cousin who was 15 years old at the time, survived the fall and told the Guardian he still remembers being chased to the third floor of the abandoned building by three men and finding a shoe print on the back of his shirt when he woke up. And yet, Keith Gourneau and Delonais said the incident had never been investigated. Seventeen years later, Gourneau found his younger son, Kyle Delonais, a 27-year-old college student and father of two, outside his home on the Turtle Mountain Reservation in a parked car, shot in the head. Gourneau said he remembered that despite Delonais lying all the way back in his seat, the gun was inexplicably resting on his lap. His death was ruled a suicide, according to an autopsy. The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians did not respond to requests for comment. Nagle, who represents Gourneau’s family, said she and her colleagues first contacted the MMU, requesting they look into Keith’s sons’ cases in late June 2021. She received emails in July saying they would be in touch, and then despite following up again on 5 January, said she hadn’t heard anything since. “I want justice, that’s all, then I can live with it,” said Gourneau. “But other than that, I cannot live with this. It’s tearing me apart inside.” The problem, according to Abigail Echo-Hawk, enrolled citizen of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, is the lack of transparency on the criteria used when determining which cases the MMU will investigate as well as not enough cross-collaboration and resources. “They’re doing the best they can with what they have,” she said. “Is it enough? No. Do I wish they could do more? 100%. But they’re actually trying.” Last April, Haaland said during a hearing on Joe Biden’s 2022interior department budget request that the missing and murdered unit would have a $6m budget, $5m more than Operation Lady Justice. “I feel like with the added budget and the leadership of the justice services, that we’ll be able to make some inroads and really make a difference for communities across the country,” she said. Bennett is one of the cases that, on the surface, the unit seems to be focusing its resources on. Her case was assigned to an agent, and her image has been featured on the unit’s website. Yet nine months after her disappearance, the same issues her mother initially faced appear to still be keeping the MMU’s case from moving forward. In emails shared with the Guardian by Gomez, the attorney representing her family, in late January the Navajo chief of police, Daryl Noon, confirmed that the case was referred to the MMU and that the unit had conducted an investigation but had yet to share its findings. However, two months later, when Gomez spoke with a regional agent, she said he told her they were waiting for the go-ahead from the tribe’s president. Yazzie, Bennett’s mother, said she had lost all hope that the unit will step in. “I don’t know where to turn or where to look or even who to ask about her again.”",News/US news,‘People are angry’: US families feel let down by Indigenous missing unit,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/01/mmu-missing-and-murdered-unit-indigenous-native-american
4/1/2022,"Post- is technically a duet between New York pianist David Friend and soundtrack composer Jerome Begin, but it actually sounds like a solo piano being sonically reflected through a series of wobbly fairground mirrors. Friend plays precise, metrical, minimalist solos, while Begin uses electronics to process these solos in real time – often amplifying and enhancing each note’s natural higher harmonics. On the eight-minute Rolling, a series of unresolved, ambiguous chords are played as rippling arpeggios, but the resonant, high-end harmonics produced by each note seem to develop a life of their own as the piece goes on, shimmering like wind chimes and wreathed in echo. Like Thunder is a piece of incredibly fast minimalism where every piano note is put through more and more electronic effects as the track goes on, resembling a filtered disco version of Steve Reich’s Piano Phase, until the piano noises mutate into a barrage of chirrups and chimes. Cluster and Dissolve is a slow, minor-key waltz, so heavily distorted that it sounds like it’s being played on a sinking ghost ship; while Gated Memories resembles one of Keith Jarrett’s Köln Concert improvisations, accompanied by the burble of amplified harmonics. An accompanying essay by Friend claims that this is an album of “queer music” – one that is about “disrupting binaries” and breaking down “highly gendered” classifications in classical music – although, to these ears, it invokes lots of stereotypically masculine sonic archetypes. The opening track, These Patterns, is a classic piece of additive minimalism, where a simple Lydian scale keeps increasing in length, but it’s played with the speed and intensity of thrash metal. Another piece of disorientating minimalism, Quick, has similarly violent overtones – like Philip Glass on PCP. This is weirdly brutal music that is miles from the polite, effete and blankly asexual world of the American minimalists, and is all the better for it. In a similar vein is Kernschmelze III: Concerto for Improvised Cello (Caliban Records), where virtuoso cellist Kate Shortt seems to be battling against a barrage of found sounds, ambient drones and grinding industrial effects being deployed by veteran poet (and Crass drummer) Penny Rimbaud. Five Minutes For Earth (Azica Records) features harpist Yolanda Kondonassis playing 15 solos by contemporary composers, lurching from the plangent and the spooky to the nouveau romantic and the dreamily hypnotic. Object/Animal (Sideband Records) sees Chicago’s Ensemble Dal Niente playing commissions by three composers – a piece of horror-movie orchestrations by Tortoise’s Jeff Parker; a collage of disorientating drones, beats and discordant voicings from Turkish composer Murat Çolak; and a haunting vocal-led work by LJ White.",Arts/Music,David Friend & Jerome Begin: Post- review – weirdly brutal American minimalism,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/01/david-friend-jerome-begin-post--review-weirdly-brutal-american-minimalism
4/1/2022,"The federal Liberal party’s ability to appoint candidates for key NSW seats including two ministers and a sitting MP hangs in the balance, with the state’s court of appeal reserving its decision in a long-running preselection dispute. Sydney businessman Matthew Camenzuli, a member of the Liberal state executive, is seeking to overturn the preselections of the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, in Mitchell, the environment minister, Sussan Ley, in Farrer, and North Sydney MP, Trent Zimmerman. They were re-endorsed as candidates in their seats in March by a three-person committee appointed by the federal branch. The committee comprised Morrison, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, and former federal president of the party Chris McDiven with the intervention denying local party members a say. The court on Friday declined to make an immediate ruling even though the prime minister could call the election as soon as this weekend. A ruling is expected next week – probably on Monday – and it could force the Liberal party to hold rank and file preselections in at least eight winnable NSW seats on the eve of the election. The election must be held by Saturday 21 May with 14 May mooted as a possible polling day. The writs dissolving parliament must be issued 33 days before polling day by the governor general and nominations to stand as a candidate close 10 days after the writs are issued. If the federal party wins the court of appeal case it will be free to parachute candidates into seats. But it is also likely the losing camp will attempt to appeal to the high court – plunging the Liberals into further unwanted legal drama. The latest chapter in the Liberal party’s crisis over preselections played out before the NSW court of appeal on Friday after the high court remitted it to the NSW courts. Camenzuli is seeking a declaration that the committee was acting beyond its powers and that only members of branches are empowered by the NSW constitution to choose candidates. He also wants injunctions to restrain the committee from handpicking candidates for a further five seats. The NSW Liberals introduced the so-called Warringah rules in 2018 which require candidates to be chosen by branch plebiscites – with 25% of votes reserved for the party machine. Championed by former prime minister Tony Abbott, the rules were meant to introduce more democracy and curtail the power of factional leaders. But internal manoeuvring has prevented preselection votes from occurring, plunging the NSW division into crisis and prompting the federal intervention. Counsel for Camenzuli, Scott Robertson SC, said the Liberal party was structured very much as a federation with the key administrative unit being the branches. The state divisions had the primary responsibility for the management and control of the party on a day-to-day basis while the federal division had the power to intervene in the affairs of the state divisions in limited circumstances, he told the court of appeal on Friday. This included insolvency, non-compliance with the federal constitution, or if there were actions that, in the opinion of the federal division, “substantially prejudice the ability of the party to effectively contest or win a federal election”. The federal executive relied on the last ground when it appointed the committee to take over the NSW branch. But Robertson said this power was limited “to intervening in management”, and they could not take on powers that were not powers of management. “The federal executive was entitled to say: ‘You have hit the wall here, and we are taking over management.’ They could have held the review committees, booked the halls and held the preselections,” he said. But it could not take on powers given to rank and file members to select candidates, the barrister said. But counsel for Morrison and the other members of the committee, Guy Reynolds SC, said the rules allowing the federal executive to intervene “only really operated in an emergency” and it was clearly designed to let “it cut right through any problems”. Preselections are one of those issues that can be complex for large political parties, he said. The federal division was given some shared responsibility for federal preselections – it has the power to revoke a preselection in limited circumstances – and for making a federal election campaign run smoothly, so the Liberal party clearly envisaged a sharing of responsibilities, Reynolds said. The constitutions of political parties were not drafted with the precision of a statute and so had to be interpreted with an eye to workability, he said. A threshold issue before the court is whether it can involve itself in a dispute within a voluntary unincorporated association like a political party. In a 1934 high court case, Cameron v Hogan, the ex-premier of Victoria failed in an attempt to have his expulsion from the Labor party declared null and void. At that time the courts were disinclined to intervene in “club cases”. But Robertson said on Friday times had moved on. “This is a matter that arises under federal law because the federal Electoral Act gives the Australian electoral commission the power to list candidates endorsed by political parties on the ballot paper,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Candidates were given the status of being a party-endorsed candidate under the Electoral Act, and this valuable official recognition meant a court could judge the matter. “It would be a surprising result if the court said this is a matter arising under federal law, but we do not have the power to deal with it,” Robertson said. But Reynolds said the cases were similar and Cameron v Hogan was binding. “There is a lot of jurisprudential meat on the bones of this judgment,” he said. A more recent case brought by ALP member Diana Asmar against the federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, over intervention in Labor preselections in Victoria was resolved by the high court this week when it refused to accept an appeal. The Victorian court of appeal considered it did have power to deal with that case despite it involving an internal party dispute.",News/Australia news,NSW appeal court to decide fate of federal intervention in Liberal preselection stoush,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/nsw-appeal-court-to-decide-fate-of-federal-intervention-in-liberal-preselection-stoush
4/1/2022,"Pizza Express waiting staff have won back a bigger slice of their tips after a year-long campaign against a change that handed more to kitchen staff. The restaurant workers were forced to take action after their share of tips and service charges paid on credit and debit cards was cut from 70% to 50% last year at a time when pay was already under pressure from social-distancing measures that limited the number of diners. A shift to cashless payments during the coronavirus pandemic had also knocked back tips for staff. After a campaign by workers backed by the Unite union, from this May, waiting staff will again receive 70% of tips made on credit cards, a change worth about £2,000 extra a year. Kitchen workers will get 30%. Waiting staff say they should receive a bigger share of tips and the service charge as they tend to receive lower hourly pay and fewer guaranteed hours than those in the kitchen and do not have an opportunity to receive a bonus. One member of the waiting staff, who said it was a struggle to survive on the basic legal minimum wage they received, said that some colleagues had cried with happiness at the planned increase in the share of tips after months of financial struggle. “The original decision was insane,” the worker said. “The change came in so suddenly that reasonably predictable earnings every month suddenly disappeared. Stuff had to be put on hold.” Another said the change was a relief as they had already been forced to take on extra shifts to make ends meet and their energy bill had just risen by £100 a month and their council tax bill had also gone up. “This is going to be a distinct improvement,” the worker said. Unite’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “This decision is long overdue and a welcome change. Pizza Express waiters have been fighting this ill-thought-out, unpopular and unfair tipping policy for over a year and have faced massive internal pressure from the company to stay silent and accept it. “This victory sends a clear message throughout the hospitality sector that Unite will challenge and overturn unfair tipping policies.” Card tips at Pizza Express, and many other restaurants, are managed via a “tronc” in which a committee of staff members decide on how they are allocated. However, unions and staff argue that the committees can be influenced by the restaurants who pay the fees of its head, usually an external consultant called a troncmaster. After the campaign, a majority of the eight members of the committee, half of which are kitchen staff, voted to hand back 70% of tips to waiting staff. A spokesperson for Pizza Express said: “The tipping policy is entirely employee-led.” They said the latest change had been made after a “planned review”. They added: “100% of all tips continue to go to our restaurant teams and cash tips go directly to the server. Pizza Express pays the card fees to ensure 100% of tips go to the restaurant team.” The change to tipping policy comes as hospitality businesses struggle to cope with rising costs because of rising energy and food prices as well as heavy competition for a dwindling pool of qualified workers caused by Brexit and the pandemic. Chefs are in particularly high demand. The latest controversy over tips at Pizza Express comes six years after the company was forced to reverse a policy of taking an 8% “administration fee” from tips paid by card. The government has promised to introduce legislation to ban restaurants from taking customer tips and service charge payments from workers. However, the legislation has yet to being introduced more than five years after a ban was first proposed.",News/Business,Pizza Express waiting staff win back bigger slice of tips,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/01/pizza-express-waiting-staff-win-back-bigger-slice-of-tips
4/1/2022,"Dublin four-piece Pillow Queens make guitar music that is unconcerned with attracting attention. There are no memorable choruses, no outlandish lyrics, no experimental sounds. This is atmospheric indie, determined to cultivate a vibe rather than relay a particular message or advertise an individual personality. On their second album, Leave the Light On, that vibe is mainly brooding unease, sometimes explosive frustration, frequently steeped in a sense of hard-won wisdom and bittersweet catharsis. The nature of the lyrics – abstract, impressionistic imagery that strives to make sense on an emotional level rather than a literal one – means it’s difficult to be more specific than that, although themes do sometimes emerge. The main preoccupations are oppression – both female (Well Kept Wife) and financial (No Good Woman) – and romantic dysfunction: either a wild desperation to deeply connect (a forlorn lover wants to “feel every pulse to the shake in your leg” on the alternately rumbling and soaring Be By Your Side), or a realisation that connection has, inevitably, soured. Sonically, the album evokes the work of Americana-influenced alt-rock musicians such as Angel Olsen, Sharon Van Etten and even the Killers – a sound that is both epically transcendent and comfortingly gritty. Pillow Queens add a few more extended shredding sessions to the template, but they largely stick within the bounds of this classy, serious style. It’s not one that gives the group a particularly distinctive flavour, but it is at least able to contain all the feelings of confusion, fury, outsized desire and whatever else the listener wants to extrapolate from this evocative if slightly nebulous record.",Arts/Music,"Pillow Queens: Leave the Light On review – brooding, atmospheric indie",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/01/pillow-queens-leave-the-light-on-review-royal-mountain-records
4/1/2022,"A former SAS soldier who testified that Ben Roberts-Smith ordered him to stage a mock execution of a comrade during a training drill has defended himself in court against accusations he was a liar and fantasist who was trying to justify his own failures as a soldier. Roberts-Smith’s lawyers accused the former soldier, known as Person 10, of fabricating evidence out of malice against Roberts-Smith, and feelings of inadequacy about his own performance on missions in Afghanistan. Person 10 was subpoenaed to give evidence in court by three newspapers defending a defamation action brought by Roberts-Smith, his former comrade and Victoria Cross recipient. Roberts-Smith alleges the newspapers’ reports portrayed him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. Person 10 has told the court Roberts-Smith ordered him to mock execute a comrade acting as an Afghan prisoner – handcuffed and on his knees – during a pre-deployment training exercise. “Shoot him,” Roberts-Smith allegedly told Person 10 twice, who responded by saying “bang-bang”. Roberts-Smith then allegedly said to Person 10: “That’s how it’s going to be on the day.” Arthur Moses SC, acting for Roberts-Smith, suggested to Person 10 his testimony was false. “This story … is a fantasy that you’ve concocted … in order to besmirch the reputation of Mr Roberts-Smith … you feel you had to come here to back it up … or you’d be exposed as a liar and a fantasist,” Moses said. “Incorrect,” Person 10 replied. In his evidence to the court last year, Roberts-Smith denied the mock execution ever took place, describing it as a “ludicrous scenario”. “It’s just a stupid thing for someone to have said.” The soldier who was allegedly mock executed is set to be called as a witness for Roberts-Smith later in this trial. Over two days in the witness box, Person 10 also testified to a failed mission in the Chora Valley, during which he said he accidentally fired in the direction of a woman and child, and other Australian soldiers. Back at the Australian barracks after the mission was over, Roberts-Smith punched Person 10 in the face in front of other soldiers, the court heard. Roberts-Smith conceded, in his evidence last year, he punched Person 10, and said he reported his actions to senior command. On Friday, Moses argued Person 10 was lying in his evidence because he was embarrassed about his performance as an SAS soldier and refused to take responsibility for it. Person 10 had an alcohol problem during his time in the regiment, lacked maturity and tactical skills, Moses said, referencing performance reports and an incident in Kabul when he was drunk and stole a female US intelligence officer’s phone and took photos of his penis with it. “You’ve never come to grips with the fact that you are a failed SASR soldier.” “I have Mr Moses, I’ve moved on,” Person 10 replied.

After the Chora Valley mission, Person 10 was removed from Roberts-Smith’s patrol, and assigned to a different patrol, but he said his performance as a soldier deteriorated. “I noticed I was withdrawing a lot from my teammates. Essentially [I] started getting into depression, anxiety. I couldn’t think clearly, I couldn’t sleep.” Person 10 said he held no grudge against Roberts-Smith. “I hold nothing against Mr Roberts-Smith,” he said. “I don’t want to be here [in court], I’m compelled to be here. I’m answering these questions honestly.” The trial, before Justice Anthony Besanko, continues on Monday.",News/Australia news,Witness in Ben Roberts-Smith defamation trial denies he is a ‘liar and a fantasist’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/witness-in-ben-roberts-smith-defamation-trial-denies-he-is-a-liar-and-a-fantasist
