3/13/2022,"I know it may be hard to convince you, but let me try: Don’t kill the next spider you see in your home. Why? Because spiders are an important part of nature and our indoor ecosystem – as well as being fellow organisms in their own right. People like to think of their dwellings as safely insulated from the outside world, but many types of spiders can be found inside. Some are accidentally trapped, while others are short-term visitors. Some species even enjoy the great indoors, where they happily live out their lives and make more spiders. These arachnids are usually secretive, and almost all you meet are neither aggressive nor dangerous. And they may be providing services like eating pests – some even eat other spiders. My colleagues and I conducted a visual survey of 50 North Carolina homes to inventory just which arthropods live under our roofs. Every single house we visited was home to spiders. The most common species we encountered were cobweb spiders and cellar spiders. Both build webs where they lie in wait for prey to get caught. Cellar spiders sometimes leave their webs to hunt other spiders on their turf, mimicking prey to catch their cousins for dinner. Although they are generalist predators, apt to eat anything they can catch, spiders regularly capture nuisance pests and even disease-carrying insects – for example, mosquitoes. There’s even a species of jumping spider that prefers to eat blood-filled mosquitoes in African homes. So killing a spider doesn’t just cost the arachnid its life, it may take an important predator out of your home. It’s natural to fear spiders. They have lots of legs and almost all are venomous – though the majority of species have venom too weak to cause issues in humans, if their fangs can pierce our skin at all. Even entomologists themselves can fall prey to arachnophobia. I know a few spider researchers who overcame their fear by observing and working with these fascinating creatures. If they can do it, so can you! Spiders are not out to get you and actually prefer to avoid humans; we are much more dangerous to them than vice versa. Bites from spiders are extremely rare. Although there are a few medically important species like widow spiders and recluses, even their bites are uncommon and rarely cause serious issues.

It’ll find somewhere else to go, and both parties will be happier with the outcome. But if you can stomach it, it’s OK to have spiders in your home. In fact, it’s normal. And frankly, even if you don’t see them, they’ll still be there. So consider a live-and-let-live approach to the next spider you encounter.

3/13/2022,"Far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) split opinion among her critics with a new campaign ad on Friday. Namely, they couldn’t agree on what was the most bonkers bit in the clip she shared on Facebook. Watch the video here: Responding to the Republican Accountability Project’s call to name “the most ridiculous part,” some Twitter users suggested it was Greene’s opening fire on concepts such as gun control and socialism. Others highlighted its sycophantic praise of former President Donald Trump. Fans of the rock band Linkin Park, meanwhile, asked if the members of the group knew if Fleurie, Jung Youth and Tommee Profitt’s reworked version of their hit song “In The End” was being used in the spot. A pro-Trump video featuring the same cover was removed from Twitter in 2020 after being retweeted by the then-president. At the time, Jung Youth slammed its use as “propaganda.” Linkin Park’s late frontman, Chester Bennington, was no fan of Trump. Representatives for the group did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/13/2022,"Yahoo Finance's Rick Newman evaluates whether or not the 'Putin price hike' on gas prices is actually real. BRAD SMITH: Yahoo Finance's Rick Newman standing by. And Rick, the White House attempting to answer for rising gas prices in a new way. So what's the latest here? RICK NEWMAN: The buzz phrase people are going to start hearing is Putin price hikes, the Putin price hike. So it's now Vladimir Putin's fault that oil and gas prices are going as high as they are. Biden started talking about this, this week. And you can kind of see the concerted effort, the talking points coming out of the White House, Biden's economic advisors, other people talking about what's happening in the economy. And Biden was very blunt. Earlier this week, he went to Texas, and somebody said, what can you do about rising gas prices? And he said not much right now. It's Russia's fault. So if you look at it, it's true that the price hikes we've seen, let's say, during the last three weeks clearly related to the big spike in oil prices that happened after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. But of course, we saw a lot of inflation in oil and gas prices and in other types of energy before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, before markets had priced that in. So as with many things that politicians say, Biden is partly correct, but partly not right on this one. BRAD SMITH: And so Rick, while we have you, this comes at a time where we've been monitoring extremely closely over the course of this crisis where the president's approval rating has been and where this attempt by the White House to kind of reposition the story, where that will either help them out or be more detrimental in their future. RICK NEWMAN: Well, his approval rating has ticked up a couple of points. It bottomed out at about 41%. That is very low, and I don't think it's at all surprising. You can point to a low unemployment rate and other things that are going right, but it's just that when you look at inflation that is now almost 8%, 7.9%, and possibly going higher, that's just-- I mean, that's just reflects badly on the president, whether it's his fault or not. So Biden has gotten good marks for his handling of the crisis in Ukraine so far, the sanctions that he's put on Russia. He's walked a middle road by making sure US troops do not get involved and keeping US and NATO forces out of Ukraine for now. And people seem to think he's doing about the right thing, but the danger for Biden is if this becomes a prolonged stalemate in Ukraine, and we have sort of permanently higher gas prices with no end to this conflict in sight, people are going to lose patience and tolerance. In fact, I think Biden's maybe got a couple of weeks before his approval rating goes back down unless gas prices turn around and come back. BRAD SMITH: Of course, this all happens during a midterm election year. And so right now, the White House in a tough position of having to decide where and how additional oil would be pumped or having partners around the world that could help unveil some more supply to meet demand and lower some of those prices in the near term, while at the same time, trying to unveil strategies for the long-term and a shift towards clean energy. And so how does that square up going into this midterm election year, especially for Democrats? RICK NEWMAN: It's a real problem for Biden because the-- his long-term answer, which is more renewable energy to get down costs for American consumers, that is not going to happen this year. And it's not going to happen next year. I mean, it is true that as more-- as solar energy and wind and renewables do come online, they do get cheaper. But we just-- there's no way we can make that pivot fast enough to make a difference in the terms of the things that Americans care about right now, which is gas prices that are over $4.20 a barrel. So I think the good news for Biden, I mean, people do need to remember-- the US president doesn't control the oil spigots in the United States. The president cannot decide that the United States is going to produce more oil. This is not Saudi Arabia or Russia. This is all in the private sector. But I think the good news for Biden is that the higher prices go, the more of a profit motive there is for private sector drillers to actually turn on some of these idled rigs and get more oil coming because they can cash in and make money on it. So we are seeing that. The rig count is up. We are going to get more supply coming in the United States. But Biden is right when he says Putin is the one who's causing this most recent spike, and Putin is the one who has the most power to end it. I don't think he will.",Business/Yahoo Finance Video,Bidenomics: Is the ‘Putin price hike’ real?,https://news.yahoo.com/bidenomics-putin-price-hike-real-210026293.html
3/13/2022,"BANGKOK (AP) — Thousands of Russian tourists are stranded in Thailand's beach resorts because of the war in Ukraine, many unable to pay their bills or return home because of sanctions and canceled flights. The crisis in Europe also put a crimp in recovery plans for the Southeast Asian nation’s tourism industry, which has hosted more visitors from Russia than any of its neighbors before the pandemic hit. There are about 6,500 Russian tourists stuck in Phuket, Surat Thani, Krabi and Pattaya, four provinces that are popular seaside resort destinations, in addition to 1,000 Ukrainians, Yuthasak Supasorn, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, told The Associated Press on Friday. Some 17,599 Russians accounted for the largest bloc of arrivals in February, representing 8.6% of a total of 203,970, according to the Public Health Ministry. After the Feb. 24 Russian invasion of Ukraine, their numbers drastically declined. Yuthasak said the Russians face two main problems: cancellations of their flights home by airlines that have stopped flying to Russia, and suspension of financial services, particularly by credit card companies that have joined sanctions against Moscow. There are also some who prefer to delay their return. “There are some airlines that still fly to Russia, but travelers have to transit in another country. We are trying to coordinate and search the flights for them,"" Yuthasak said. While almost all direct flights from Russia have been suspended, connections are still available through major carriers based in the Middle East. He said efforts are also being made to find alternative methods of payments for Russian tourists. Siwaporn Boonruang, a volunteer translator for Russians stranded in Krabi, said some cannot pay their bills because they can no longer use Visa or Mastercard credit cards. Many have cash and those with UnionPay credit cards, which are issued by a Chinese financial services company, can still use them, but payment by cryptocurrency is not allowed, she said. Many hotels have helped by offering discounted rates, she added. Thailand's government has offered 30-day visa extensions without payment, and is trying to find low-cost alternative accommodation for people forced to stay for an extended period. The problems associated with the war in Ukraine have compounded Thailand's hopes for economic recovery. Officials hope to see the threat from the COVID-19 pandemic ebbing by July, even though daily cases are currently at record highs, driven by the omicron variant of the coronavirus. Thai authorities later this year expect to drop most quarantine and testing regulations that have been in place to fight the spread of the virus, which would make entry easier for foreign travelers. Thailand may have to lower its targets for tourist arrivals and revenues this year because of the knock-on effects of rising oil prices and inflation on global travel, Yuthasak was quoted saying by the Bangkok Post newspaper. “Tourism is still a key engine to revive our economy, even though revenue was stymied by negative factors,” he said. According to the report, Thailand had projected gaining a total of 1.28 trillion baht ($38.4 billion) in revenue this year from foreign and domestic tourists.",World/Associated Press,"Cashless and flightless, Russian tourists stuck in Thailand",https://news.yahoo.com/cashless-flightless-russian-tourists-stuck-131909054.html
