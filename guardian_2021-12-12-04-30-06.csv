12/12/2021,"There was confusion on Saturday about which age groups in England are now eligible to book a booster jab with the NHS, after an apparent glitch allowed younger people to book before they were expected to qualify. People aged 30 and over in England were expected to be able to book a Covid-19 booster from Monday as long as it has been three months since their second vaccine dose, but many 30-somethings reported on social media on Saturday that they had been able to book their appointments already.  “NHS website will now let you book a booster jab if you’re over 30. Just booked mine!” one Twitter user wrote. Another user tweeted: “I’ve managed to book a booster jab for Monday 20th through NHS site! Seems they are accepting under-40 bookings even though the page says otherwise!” However, those under 30 appeared to still be unable to secure an appointment for a booster dose via the NHS website. Cristian, a 26-year-old from London, tried booking a slot on Saturday via the NHS website but was told he was “not currently able to book through this service”. However, on Thursday he had been invited by his GP practice to book his booster jab. “I felt really weird when I received the text because it came completely out of the blue, especially after hearing from the government that my age group was probably not going to be eligible for a booster jab until at least January,” Cristian said. “I’m happy that local authorities are moving quicker than I thought, but I did question whether the text was a scam because I did not hear anything about a speedier rollout, and I’m afraid some people might not book theirs if they believe the text not to be real.” Some GPs had started offering booster vaccines to patients under 40 against official NHS guidance. Health secretary Sajid Javid urged people on Twitter on Saturday afternoon to “come forward and get boosted”. “We are turbocharging our booster programme,” Javid wrote. New data from @UKHSA shows boosters could offer up to 75% protection against infection from Omicron.We are turbocharging our booster programme. Come forward and #GetBoosted when you’re eligible to keep yourself and your loved ones safe this winter.https://t.co/1FnxPHSAfK One Twitter user responded to air his frustration and apparent confusion: “We have a [23-year-old], over 5 months since 2nd jab, living at home with CEV [clinically extremely vulnerable] parent. NHS website says eligible for booster. Tried booking and told not eligible. Rang 119, same answer. So much for your turbocharging of the booster programme.” The NHS website still said on Saturday evening that “the NHS is working on plans to offer a booster dose to everyone aged 18 to 39 years old”, and that people should note that this service is not yet available to book via their portal. “Please wait to be contacted by the NHS,” a disclaimer on the website added.",News/UK news,Confusion over booster eligibility in England as people in 30s book Covid jabs,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/11/confusion-over-booster-eligibility-in-england-as-people-in-30s-book-covid-jabs
12/12/2021,"“Aren’t we all having fun? What about you in the back row? Yes, we are all having fun. As much fun as a Downing Street Christmas party!” So runs a gag in the pantomime entertaining families in Greenwich, south London, this month. And if the government across the river in Westminster were hoping that seasonal festivities might distract from accusations of rule-breaking in No 10 last Christmas, then the nation’s pantomime performers look set to disappoint them.  In fact, no sooner have the wounds inflicted by Ant and Dec, who made an on-air jibe about cheese and wine and secret Santas last week, stopped smarting, than panto dames such as Andrew Pollard, the man behind Greenwich Theatre’s show, take up the satirical theme. “It is just so ripe for it really,” Pollard told the Observer. “And it is the joy of pantomime that you can throw topical things into the script when you want to.” Pollard, a veteran of the scene, who is playing the eponymous Queen of Hearts in the production as well as directing his own script, added that, in line with pantomime tradition, his team usually steer away from being “overly political”. But he admits the line about the Downing Street party often wins one of the biggest audience reactions of the evening. At the Lyric Hammersmith, Boris Johnson himself appears to be taking to the boards. The character of the emperor in the theatre’s production of Aladdin is dressed in a blond shock-wig, an ill-fitting blue suit and clown shoes, and is also played by a woman. Yet is quite recognisably a representation of Britain’s current leader. Much of the action in the show takes place in what is clearly a version of the expensively constructed Downing Street media room. And many other pantomimes across the country are joining in. In Glasgow, where Elaine C Smith stars in Cinderella at the King’s Theatre, the script is stuffed with references to fictional festive gatherings and hypocrisy in high places. On Tuesday, Ant and Dec entertained viewers of ITV’s I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! by making fun of the idea of illicit celebrations. They continued in the next episode, chiding contestants for “trying to get away with things”. The presenting pair occasionally also explicitly address the prime minister, looking directly into the camera to say hello. Whether all this seasonal merry-making will really mark a change in voter attitudes is harder to predict. It may signal the moment when some of the controversies raging among parliamentary commentators and political analysts begin to bite. On the other hand, when Matt Lucas impersonated Johnson’s announcements on last year’s opening episode of The Great British Bake Off on Channel 4, it was initially heralded as a very bad day for the Conservative party. Fifteen months on, the same regime remains in power.",Arts/Stage,Dame blame game: now the joke’s on Boris Johnson as panto stars mock No 10 ‘party’,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/dec/11/boris-johnson-downing-street-parties-pantos-piercing-political-hypocrisy
12/12/2021,"In early 2020, the academic, artist and artistic director Brook Andrew travelled to the small town of Collarenebri in north-west New South Wales to show the local Kamilaroi community some shocking footage he’d found that he wanted to feature as part of the 2020 Sydney Biennale. Shot in 1949, it showed wealthy Adelaide collector and businessman Harry Balfour supervising a team of timber workers as they felled dozens of trees.  The trees – some possibly as old as 800 years – were covered in detailed carvings and sacred to the Kamilaroi First Nations people. Using circular saws to separate the large carved sections from the trunks, they were loaded on to trucks, transported by rail and stacked on to ships for distribution around the globe. The carved trees of the Banarway Bora had played a central role in Aboriginal knowledge systems for centuries yet only a handful remained on country in Collarenebri, 75km north-east of Walgett. More than 50 had been removed in the 1940s and are now housed in public museums and private collections around the world. Most of the town’s 650 residents gathered to watch the footage. “People were crying, others were shocked. Only a few people knew about the existence of these trees,” Andrew recalls. “There were a lot of people who were pretty upset.” Now, in a bid to bring the trees home, students at Collarenebri Central School have become global advocates, presenting a short but moving documentary called Gaaguuwiya Dhawunga (Bring Back Home), which premiered at an international conference at the Ethnography Museum of Geneva late last month and has since been posted on YouTube. Somewhat paradoxically, two of the carved trees have been traced to the collection of the Geneva museum. Another tree has been located in the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford University, while the Melbourne Museum was already known to be in possession of two. The community wants them back. Andrew, a descendent of the Wiradjuri people of central NSW, uncovered the 1949 footage in 2019 while conducting research with fellow Monash University academic Brian Martin into artefacts made from south-eastern Australian trees. The project has so far uncovered tens of thousands of artefacts spread across more than 200 Australian and overseas museums, with more than 30,000 objects tracked down in British institutions alone. Kamilaroi elder Ros McGregor has been bringing First Nations cultural knowledge to the students of Collarenebri for the past 15 years, including knowledge about the trees of the Banarway Bora that are still on country. Four years ago McGregor and Sydney artists Sam Newstead and Liz O’Reilly supervised the students in creating a mural celebrating the trees that was painted on the exterior of the school’s community hall. McGregor explains the return of the trees is vital to the healing and teaching of local Kamilaroi culture. “The carved trees have a spirit that is past, present and future,” she says. “The return of the others will give us connection to our own knowledge system and an opportunity to continue learning lessons from the very first Bora. “We can never go back to the times and way of life we had when the trees were carved, but the images and patterns on the trees speak directly to us as Kamilaroi people.” McGregor says the brutality of the footage Andrew showed was deeply disturbing. “The size of that saw … what they were doing to our living trees that our people took so long to create. There is a lot of healing still to be done.” The Kamilaroi people and Monash University are now in advanced negotiations with Museums Victoria to have the trees repatriated. A museum spokesperson said in a statement: “Museums Victoria’s First Peoples strategy is committed to bringing collections to Country, giving self-determination for material in our care to First Peoples and building ethical and reciprocal partnerships between Museums Victoria and communities. “Museums Victoria are committed to repatriating the carved trees to the traditional owners and working with the community which these trees are from.” Brian Martin, who is a descendant of the Muruwari, Bundjalung and Kamilaroi peoples from northern NSW and southern Queensland and the Monash University Art Design & Architecture’s associate dean Indigenous, says the tone of the negotiations between the museum and the people of Collarenebri was what decolonising was all about. “It’s about this idea that taking them was a violent act but we don’t react in a violent way by just demanding them back,” he says. “Of course it’s very important to get them back. But we also want to do it through a healing process, and do it in a way that is beneficial for us, but beneficial for the institution as well.”",Arts/Culture,‘The carved trees have a spirit’: Kamilaroi fight to repatriate sacred 800-year-old trunks,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/dec/12/the-carved-trees-have-a-spirit-kamilaroi-fight-to-repatriate-sacred-800-year-old-trunks
12/12/2021,"Pre-Covid, when international travel was still common, many Kiwi travellers received a similar question wherever they happened to be around the globe: Jacinda Ardern, is she the real deal? The New Zealand prime minister’s devotion to a new breed of politics, one rooted in “kindness”, “compassion” and “cooperation” often seemed too saccharine to be true, especially at a time when a series of notorious bullies were voted into positions of power around the globe.  I usually answered this question brusquely, with a combination of facts and personal anecdotes from my interviews with the PM. I was interested, but not that interested, more enthralled by the dramatic twists and turns of foreign lands, where politics seemed Shakespearean compared with the warm, cosy bath of New Zealand’s Labour coalition government, now in its second term and astoundingly popular. A record number of babies in the house, cradled by the speaker as their mothers and fathers delivered important speeches? Cute, nice, a sweet Friday news story. Freezes on politicians’ pay during Covid? Feel-good, sure. An indication of a truly new breed of politician, and a truly new way of governing? I wasn’t convinced. Earlier this year, I shifted back to my native land of Australia, and settled in the Kimberley, still the country of cowboys and red rocks I remembered from my childhood. Immediately, the absolute dysfunction of the state-federal relationship struck me, as did the absurdity of mini prime ministers individually vying for votes and cash and sway. I asked around and read around, but could find no one who could explain to me why the state system worked or should continue as a mode of governance. Instead of the national unity so desperately needed in the midst of a global pandemic, personal fiefdoms ruled. Even a national speed limit couldn’t be agreed upon. As the year wore on, punctuated by a bungled vaccine rollout and a prime minister who was tone-deaf to the mounting cries of millions of fed-up Australian women, the drama of Australian politics began to seem far less entertaining and far more concerning than when I had observed it from afar. While sledging is a national disgrace when it happens on the cricket pitch, in Canberra it’s par for the course, so bad now that even growling like a dog at your “opponent” can occur. And “opponent” is mostly how Australian politicians seem to view each other – shrill, power-hungry egos vying for domination, while transformative legislative change languishes, such as the recent climate change embarrassment at Cop26. Leaving the temperate bath that is New Zealand politics made me realise how conducive that bath was to getting things done. There is a genuine level of cooperation and – don’t be shocked here – politeness that courses through government house in Wellington and extends to how the governing party and the opposition treat each other. Sure, there is some sledging, but it is more of the quick-barb style, rather than the truly, disturbingly nasty. “I’ve never particularly done things differently depending on who the person is and that’s probably a good thing, given there’s been five,” said a cheeky Ardern last week, poking fun at the opposition’s five leaders during her time as prime minister. One, Todd Muller, experienced a mental breakdown during his tenure. Politicians on every side of the house expressed genuine empathy and concern for his welfare, and his painful experience became an opportunity, eventually, for further mental health awareness and discussion, rather than cannon fodder or public shaming. New Zealand is much too small for true divisiveness among its leaders, much as people in small towns are to some degree forced to get along, decade after decade, despite their often myriad differences. Much of the credit goes to Ardern, who has created a working environment that rewards focus and dedication. Indeed, despite her robust sense of humour, Ardern is a deeply serious politician, one who joined the Labour party aged 17, motivated by a desire to “end child poverty”. The politicians Ardern chooses to promote are so thoroughly earnest and scandal-free (think Grant Robertson and Nanaia Mahuta) that the culture has become one of genuine public service. She even makes her ministers carpool in a minivan to events, scrapping the isolation and pomp of ministerial cars. This is a small gesture but it communicates volumes about her values and style of governing. Politics is far from perfect in New Zealand, and like in Australia, there have been internal sex scandals, disappointing housing reforms and complaints from the media about fair access. But the general atmosphere is one of a sincere interest in improving the lives of New Zealanders. This makes sense, because politicians in New Zealand remain, well, New Zealanders. Most aren’t personally wealthy or drawn from the corporate ranks (the new leader of the opposition National party, Christopher Luxon, is an exception) and most remain strongly embedded within their communities and family life. There is a Wellington bubble, but it’s far more humble and down to earth than its Canberra equivalent. Last week, a Green party MP cycled herself to the hospital to give birth – for the second time. Last month the prime minister was interrupted doing a Facebook live event by her daughter Neve, sneaking out of bed while her mother was trying to address the nation. These glimpses of humanity aren’t orchestrated set pieces, they happen spontaneously and on a regular basis in the course of New Zealand’s politicians living ordinary human lives. I can’t be sure but I’d put some money on Ardern’s daughter being sent to her local state primary school when it’s time. Anything else would grate against her mum’s entrenched value system, and display a schism between personal and political beliefs that in four years of leadership has so far failed to emerge. In this climate, world-leading legislation has been enacted in New Zealand, including a new law to protect pill testing, legalised assisted dying, a record increase in funding to women’s refuge and domestic violence services, moves to tackle climate change and a world-leading tobacco reform (aiming to make the country smoke-free by 2025). In Australia power often seems a goal in and of itself. It is a goal that then stymies genuine legislative reform or collaboration, much to the detriment of all Australians, who can only be feeling confused and disappointed by the year that’s been, so marked by animosity and empty showmanship. In the New Zealand model there is something to learn. Sure, the beehive lacks the fireworks of Canberra and sometimes a bit of sparkle. The finance minister is mostly interested in surpluses (and rugby) and the foreign minister’s style of diplomacy is disarmingly gentle. The climate change minister is a greenie from way back. But in the hands of these – to quote the words of Ardern – “nerds” a backbone and steadiness to political life has developed, allowing nascent transformative change to begin. And oh so needed in the current global environment, a deep and reassuring sense of calm.",Opinion/Opinion,Fractious Australia has much to learn from the kindness and purpose of New Zealand politics | Eleanor de Jong,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/12/fractious-australia-has-much-to-learn-from-the-kindness-and-purpose-of-new-zealand-politics
12/12/2021,"Salmon is consistently one of the most popular kinds of seafood in Australia, but the Tasmanian farmed salmon industry has attracted significant criticism for its continued expansion and alleged environmental impact. In the past, environmental experts on review panels that oversaw industry expansion have quit in protest, telling a Tasmanian parliamentary inquiry that the panels were not truly independent and were obligated to approve expansions. One of those experts also said the planned doubling of salmon production in the coming decade had no basis in sound science.  In April, Richard Flanagan released Toxic, a book detailing the environmental devastation he says is occurring as a consequence of salmon aquaculture, and the state government’s role in allowing it. In late October, it was announced that Brazilian meat-processing giant JBS had received approval for a $500m takeover deal of Tasmanian farmer Huon. The announcement came after months of efforts from environmentalists opposing the bid. JBS in Brazil, which owns JBS Australia, has made headlines in the past for alleged links to illegal deforestation, while its major corporate shareholder J&F has paid hefty fines for bribery in Brazil and the US. The owners of J&F, Jose and Wesley Batista, have also served jail time in Brazil while awaiting trial on charges of alleged insider trading. The case is yet to be resolved. JBS Australia has not been implicated in any wrongdoing. The JBS Australia chief executive, Brent Eastwood, said: “JBS is committed to Huon, its employees, the local Tasmanian community and the broader principles of environmental sustainability, animal welfare, safety and social responsibility.” “The industry has been accused of being allowed to regulate itself, more or less,” says Adrian Meder, sustainable seafood program manager at the Australian Marine Conservation Society. “[It] has been allowed to push the environment too far and expand too fast to be able to cope with the impacts of farming.” According to Australia’s GoodFish guide to sustainable seafood, waste such as fish faeces and excess feed from open-sea cages washes into the surrounding water, introducing polluting nutrients. Low oxygen levels in the water – believed to be linked to salmon production – combined with higher water temperatures are also exacerbating the number of salmon dying from disease or asphyxiation. Salmon farming has been described as “the battery-hen farming of the sea”, Meder says. “They’ve very much chosen to maximise production at the expense of being careful environmentally. And that’s led to millions of fish deaths through disease, and dead zones created in world heritage areas.” Meder also warns that the industry and government’s planned salmon farming expansion in Tasmania’s Storm Bay, if fully realised, will mean putting the equivalent of all of Victoria and Tasmania’s ocean sewage outfalls into a single bay. The industry rejects such claims. The Tasmanian Salmon Growers Association told the Guardian in October that the industry “practises adaptive management practices, which in effect means that it can adapt to changing circumstances, such as water temperature and oxygen levels”. “It monitors pens on a 24/7 basis for fish health and water quality, and environmental monitoring is also undertaken by independent, third-party scientists and researchers.” For salmon lovers hoping to reduce the environmental impact of their food, there is some very good news: king salmon, farmed in New Zealand, is a perfect alternative. While king salmon is a different fish species, you wouldn’t know it; it can be used anywhere you would normally use Tasmanian-farmed salmon, including raw applications such as sashimi and ceviche. “We have a green-listed alternative that is actually a salmon, and also a very highly regarded product for its quality,” Meder says. “It’s the same sort of thing, simply farmed more responsibly.” According to Meder, the impact of salmon farming in New Zealand is kept under tighter government control. “That industry hasn’t been empowered and enabled by government to do whatever the hell it wants to, which is largely the situation in Tasmania,” he says. New Zealand’s seas are also colder and better suited to the physiology of salmon, meaning fish require less feed and grow more efficiently. Darren Robertson, chef and co-owner of Three Blue Ducks, says: “When sourcing salmon for the restaurant, we always use king salmon from New Zealand.” Robertson also endorses the Goodfish guide, calling it a “great resource”. His decision to source only New Zealand-farmed king salmon for Three Blue Ducks is based on its green-list status in the guide. Robertson and Meder are both also enthusiastic advocates for broadening one’s tastes and eating a variety of seafood. “This is the way we used to eat seafood,” Meder says. “Just like we’ve really narrowed our taste down to very few types of animal proteins ... we’re going the same way in seafood. It’s quite a recent thing and it means putting a lot of pressure on relatively fewer species.” The oiliness that is prized in salmon can be found in a number of other, more sustainable fish. Meder recommends sardines as a “super affordable” option that have grown in popularity in recent years, as well as bonito and mackerel. “There are so many amazing sustainable options to enjoy when it comes to seafood.,” Robertson says. “We’re big fans of barramundi, mussels, Murray cod, oysters, Spanish mackerel, freshwater crayfish, river trout, spanner crab – to be honest, the list is huge. “Cooking with a variety of seafood is a lot more exciting for us, our chefs and our customers, and is super achievable for the home cook too.” However, if you’re browsing the Goodfish guide and come across the Australian salmon, a wild-caught green-listed fish, don’t let the name fool you – it’s actually a kind of sea perch. Shannon Martinez, owner and chef at Melbourne’s Smith & Daughters and Smith & Deli, says there are a few options when it comes to plant-based alternatives to salmon. At her deli, Martinez uses watermelon to create a vegan smoked salmon. “[It’s] a smoked salmon or lox for a bagel, and at Christmas time we serve it with blinis and vegan caviar. It’s compressed and it’s roasted really slowly for a really long time, which basically takes the liquid out of it, which firms up the texture; then we smoke it and then it’s marinated.” Of course, even after the roasting step, “watermelon tastes like watermelon”, so to build the meaty umami and “oceany” taste of smoked salmon, she uses both dried and liquid kombu – kelp rich in savoury flavour – as well as dried mushroom powders and liquid smoke. Finally, plant-based omega-3 oils are added to simulate the rich fattiness of salmon. For a more approachable at-home option, Martinez also speaks enthusiastically about products made from konjac, the root of a plant, which is already used to make “zero-calorie” noodle substitutes found in supermarkets. Seafood substitutes made from konjac include squid, prawns and sashimi, the latter of which manages to look strikingly close to real sashimi. “It’s the perfect vegan replacement for seafood because it has quite a rubbery, bouncy texture,” she says, adding that konjac-based seafood substitutes can usually be found in the frozen section of Asian grocers. “It has a really neutral taste so you do need to flavour them. It’s like using any sort of starch – it doesn’t really taste like anything.”",News/Australia news,‘Battery-hen farming of the sea’: sustainable alternatives to eating salmon,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/12/battery-hen-farming-of-the-sea-sustainable-alternatives-to-eating-salmon
12/12/2021,"It was January 2010 and three South Australians were traveling across the windy, jagged coastline on the Great Ocean Road, taking the long way to Melbourne. To break up the 13-hour trip, they stopped at James Erskine’s family farm, where Tom Shobbrook and Anton van Klopper – or “Wildman” as some called him – pulled their rifles and a speargun out of the back of the Land Rover.  The next day, they headed out to Melbourne with the bounty they’d gathered at James’s farm: several wild rabbits and goats and a cooler full of spear-gunned octopus and abalone. It was all piled atop a puncheon of their experimental wine in the back of the car. A sizeable group awaited the oddball winemakers at Gertrude Street Enoteca, an Italian-focused Fitzroy wine bar and an institution for hospitality professionals and wine lovers – and, sadly, a casualty of the pandemic. It was summer, and Melbourne’s wine lovers were ready for a party. Word had been getting around about the blond, wispy-haired Wildman and the gentle-toned, glasses-wearing Tom and their strange wine projects. Tom had lived in Tuscany for several years and returned to produce wine from a family vineyard of mostly Shiraz out in the Barossa. Since 2007, Wildman was producing limited amounts of coveted wine, including Pinot and Chardonnay, from growers around the Adelaide Hills. Tom and Wildman met at a wedding and became fast friends, bonding over their unusual approach to wine, which back then they didn’t have a name for. The lanky, ever-smiling James was transitioning out of a career as an award-winning sommelier. He’d trained at the pedigreed Magill Estate, then made a name for himself while helming the list of fine-dining restaurant Auge in Adelaide. Around the country, it was a shock that a sommelier from little old Adelaide, whose dining scene was seen as laughable compared to that of Sydney or Melbourne, was winning awards. But James was intelligent, eloquent, and passionate about his work. As he was becoming increasingly known, he met Wildman. He visited Wildman’s newly purchased farm in Basket Range in the Adelaide Hills, where he was making wine using rudimentary machinery in a few ramshackle sheds, and James was smitten by the romance of it all. He enlisted Wildman to custom-make some wines for Auge. As word got around Australia of James’s affiliation with experimental winemakers, he received verbal insults from the older wine establishment. But he persisted, and not long before this journey to Melbourne, he started making his own wine. He was gaining experience at a winery in the Hills and planning his first vintage – Wildman had offered space in his shed. These three, along with another South Australian winemaker, Kerri Thompson, were in Melbourne to release wine they had made without any commercial yeasts or acids, and low amounts of sulfites. The wines were also unfiltered. It was all very novel and provocative. When they arrived at the venue, Tom had a goat carcass, wrapped in a bedsheet, over his shoulder, and James bore the cooler of fresh seafood. Chef Brigitte Hafner got to work breaking it all down. The South Australians went around the bar pouring their cloudy wines, made ​​without any stabilisers or acidifiers and with zero filtration. Not everyone there was a fan. A few weeks later an article about the tasting came out in The Age, titled Natural Selection Theory in a cheeky nod to Darwin. It praised Kerri’s rieslings but decried Wildman and Tom’s wines as dirty and flawed. Kerri soon went her own way, but the other three continued forging their bond and pushing the limits of wine. And now they had a name for their experiments. After the event in Melbourne, the three men drove straight to Sydney, sleeping on the side of the road in rolled-out swags. There, they caught up with their friend, the charismatic musician and wine industry professional Sam Hughes. Tom and Wildman first met Sam two years earlier, on a sales trip to Sydney. Sam was the shop manager of a Vaucluse bottle shop, and upon trying the South Australians’ unconventional wines, he was enamoured. Wildman and Tom, who both had young children at home and zero outside investment in their fledging wineries, were traveling on a budget. When they told Sam they planned to sleep in a park that night, he invited them over for dinner and to stay the night, and a connection was cemented. The group often drank bottles together at Paddington wine bar 10 William St, another early supporter of Tom and Wildman’s vintages. The more they tasted, the more the quartet wanted to break the rules. Natural Selection Theory, as they began calling their group, was dismantling what many in the Australian wine industry aspired to: it was irreverent and playful, uninterested in Robert Parker scores or coveted awards. But soon, this scrappy and handmade approach began attracting plenty of press, and critical acclaim. In part, it was the charisma these three winemakers, along with Sam, radiated, each in different ways. Together, they drove around Australia with demijohns full of sulfite-free wine, which they called Voice of the People, and one-litre egg-shaped vessels filled with another experiment, which tested out the notion that wines respond to outside stimuli such as emotions and speech. They even recorded a Natural Selection Theory album, with each of them playing an instrument or doing vocals, and pressed a few hundred vinyl records. There was a “hot pants” tour, where the men donned – you guessed it – extremely short shorts while presenting their wines. The point wasn’t to make money; it was to show that wine didn’t have to be snobbish or conceited. It could be uncanny and unpredictable, and the life of the party. This is a work of memoir.

12/12/2021,"On 15 December 2014, inside a repurposed shipping container in the Atlanta Botanical Garden in the USA, Mark Mandica heard an unfamiliar animal call. It was a reddish-brown frog about the size of a peach, called Toughie. He had lived silently for nine years since arriving from Panama – where the highly infectious chytrid fungus disease had arrived, leaving swathes of dead frogs in its wake.  He was believed to be the last Rabbs’ fringe-limbed tree frog in the world. “I was always extremely curious what the call sounded like … it was a loud call that sounded like a barking dog,” Mandica says. “Then it struck me that this frog was still vital and sounded very strong, and was singing out for a mate that would never come.” When Toughie’s heart stopped on 26 September 2016, the species died out. The next morning, across the country in San Diego, amphibian expert Natalie Calatayud was presented with Toughie’s testicles. This strange gift was part of a plan to use “biobanking” for conservation. The idea of freezing biological material is not new, having been used in medical research and livestock breeding programs for decades. But by using liquid nitrogen to lower animal tissues to -196C, where almost all processes of life within a cell halt, scientists hope to buy more time for assisted reproduction to help a captive colony, to investigate a devastating disease, or preserve DNA for cloning. Toughie now exists as 16 vials of precious mush, awaiting a time when technology – and potentially an unknown surviving mate – allows for the revival of the lost species. Unlike the Rabbs’ tree frog, most species disappear years before humans realise, along with any chance to preserve their genetic material. A group of scientists in Australia, in the grip of one of the world’s worst extinction crises, is hoping that some of our own endangered species can avoid this fate. They are calling for a national operation to freeze our native wildlife before that chance is lost. Australia was the first country to attempt a truly national biobank: the Animal Gene Storage and Resource Centre of Australia (now the Australian Frozen Zoo) was created in 1995. But funding and donations dried up, says its current director, reproductive expert Peter Temple-Smith. It could never fulfil its potential. The “zoo” exists as a two-metre-tall cryotank that’s been shuffled around Monash University, reliant on volunteer staff formally employed in other roles. Meanwhile, co-founder and former director Ian Gunn says biobanking for conservation has been gaining popularity overseas. “Other countries have moved ahead, and Australia has completely lagged behind.” Alongside the original, and languishing Frozen Zoo, there are now scattered facilities that cryo-preserve animal samples in pockets across the country at some zoos, universities, and museums. In March, five conservationists met with then threatened species commissioner Sally Box arguing that these must become a coordinated network – with standardised operating procedures for the technical work, dependable funding to ensure the facilities can be maintained, and one database to log every existing sample so they can be fully utilised in research. Even with their wish to create a national strategy for proactively “banking” priority species, it will be too late for some: the government itself predicts 280 animals and plants will be extinct by 2039. For these animals, their suspended cells may be the species’ last hope. Reproductive biologist Rebecca Hobbs, of the Taronga CryoDiversity Bank in New South Wales, did not attend the meeting with Box, but says national operating procedures for collecting, storing, and using samples would be crucial. Biobanking, she stresses, must work with, not replace, habitat protection and captive breeding. In captive breeding programs, variety is literally the spice of life: as the number of animals dwindles so does the genetic diversity of the group. Eventually, inbreeding leads to fertility and other health issues and the group is doomed – unless new genes are introduced. This is where advocates say biobanking is useful: in the US, researchers have reversed the black-footed ferret population out of an inbreeding spiral using frozen sperm from the “founding ferrets”, and even cloned a ferret from skin frozen in the 1980s. Banking species in the threatened-to-near-threatened categories may be most cost-effective, Hobbs says. “You may get more bang for your buck if you apply it to species that haven’t declined so much that the genetic variability has declined too dramatically for it to work.” Now back in Australia, Calatayud says current conservation strategies aren’t working, nor being done at the necessary scale. “The need for captive populations to maintain threatened species is growing at an alarming rate, disproportionate to the funding available and the logistical availability of space and staff. With biobanking, you could manage a smaller captive population by inserting new genetics whenever you needed to.” She says that biobanking domesticated species has been long accepted. Australia also has a national network to bank seeds of native plants. “Farmers everywhere bank their bull semen … and no one bats an eyelid. But in the context of wildlife, suddenly people think you’re selling some pipe dream.” Deciding which species get banked will be gruelling. Some won’t make it. “It’s a huge judgment call, it’s unfair, but it’s a case of, ‘who do I bank to save this ecosystem’? Who do we save for the greater good, because we can’t save everybody,” Calatayud says. Conservation biologist Simon Clulow, of the University of Canberra and Newcastle University, says that amphibians and reptiles are the “most imperiled vertebrate classes on Earth” but have had the least attention when it comes to biobanking. “It really wasn’t until the start of this century that we and one or two other labs around the world started to really look at developing sperm freezing and IVF techniques in frogs … for reptiles, we’re about 20 years behind that.” Despite not knowing how to successfully freeze – or bring back – every species, he’s confident the remaining hurdles will be solved given the pace at which the technologies are evolving. Some years ago Clulow and his father, John, helped produce live embryos of the extinct gastric brooding frog from tissue samples frozen decades ago. “We should absolutely be doing it, right now … You can’t go back in time once a species has disappeared.” John Clulow, who attended the Canberra meeting with Box, feels cautiously optimistic that momentum is building toward a national bank. An ecologist with expertise in reproductive technologies, he and colleagues at the University of Newcastle recently received federal funding to collect sperm from frogs in bushfire-affected areas, for use in captive breeding programs at Taronga. He says some conservationists worry that habitat protection will lag if the species in it have been preserved. “The other thing is, philosophically, conservationists are often about preserving animals within habitats, whereas this is a technological approach and that’s not as culturally embraced.” Reproductive biologist Steve Johnston says it’s too late to be hands-off. “With the koalas in south-east Queensland, we’re down to the point where if you just leave them alone, they’re just going to die,” says Johnston, of the University of Queensland. “Even with all the funding and publicity that they get, they’re still struggling.” Less charismatic species, like reptiles and amphibians, tend to attract less funding and interest. Johnston is a pioneer of the technique for successfully extracting sperm from the largest reptile alive. Lacking funding for specific facilities, he worked with Koorana Crocodile Farm. “If we could develop [the method] in the saltwater crocodile, we could apply it to other species.” His work involved enticing a 4.5m croc up to a fence with a dead chicken, putting a noose around its snout, sedating it, and hoisting the croc – a predator that has remained unchanged for 65 million years – into the air with a crane. Once it was laid across the back of two flat-tray utes, Johnston could crawl underneath to extract the penis from the slit at the junction of its legs and tail, and “milk” the sperm. The technique is now being used by different groups. “It’s somewhat invasive … but works well without causing any trauma to the animal.” The group has not heard from the commissioner’s office since their March meeting. Box left the role in October and a spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment did not answer whether acting commissioner Fiona Fraser was briefed about the proposal. They say the Threatened Species Strategy 2021-31, which includes one mention of biobanking, “recognises the importance of being prepared.” Mark Mandica is also preparing. He has mixed feelings about reviving extinct species; the need to remove them from the wild for their survival, he says, is “profoundly dark”. But to hear a Rabbs’ tree frog call again would fill his heart. “Sometimes, I think about how maybe there’s a remote population of them out there, gliding from tree to tree, that just haven’t been found yet.” Lydia Hales received support from the Science Journalists Association of Australia for this story.",News/Environment,‘We can’t save everybody’: could biobanking offer Australian animals a last hope against extinction?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/12/we-cant-save-everybody-could-biobanking-offer-australian-animals-a-last-hope-against-extinction
12/12/2021,"If anything can be guaranteed in the Western Australian seat of Pearce, it is that whoever replaces Christian Porter, it will not be a man. The urban fringe division that hugs the coast north of Perth has belonged to the Liberals for 33 years, with Porter holding Pearce for nearly a decade before his dramatic fall from grace.  But Labor has hopes of overturning the 7.5% margin from the 2019 election, with the help of favourable boundary changes, and poll watchers say it can only be a woman to step into Porter’s shoes after this year’s revelations about the toxic culture in federal parliament. The Labor candidate is the Wanneroo mayor, Tracey Roberts. The likely Liberal candidates include a former navy officer, Miquela Riley – who lost the race for Fremantle in the state election – and Roberts’ fellow Wanneroo councillor Linda Aitken. Roberts, Riley and Aitken all declined to speak on the record about the campaign. But even though the odds are that a woman will win the race, there is one man who could have a crucial, albeit indirect, influence – Mark McGowan. Some observers predict that the popularity of the WA premier could tip the balance in Pearce, even though it is well outside Perth’s traditional Labor heartland. In March, McGowan led WA Labor to one of the biggest election landslides in the nation’s history. William Bowe, of the Poll Bludger blog, says his money is on Labor in Pearce, with the latest Newspoll showing a 9% swing to the opposition across the state. “Will McGowan play a role in the federal election? That’s the million-dollar question. He is certainly playing a role in the polls,” Bowe says. “McGowan has definitely improved Labor’s brand in WA, and also Labor is coming off a very low base there. They haven’t done well in a federal election here in a very long time. “Labour can pick up a lot of ground in WA off the back of an improved image for the party.” The seat of Pearce covers a fast-growing belt of new coastal subdivisions on the northern outskirts of Perth, home to British and African migrants and young mortgaged-up families who have to commute for up to an hour to reach the city. Further to the east is a thriving agriculture region. A lack of rail connections, a shortage of healthcare facilities and the risk of bushfire will be key issues in the campaign. The general manager of the Wanneroo business association, Lauren Bell, says border restrictions and a lack of backpackers have left some businesses struggling to find workers. “There are a lot of businesses that are doing really well, but they cannot get tradies and services to fill jobs that they have ready to go,” she says. “Some people are just not getting a single applicant for jobs.” A significant boundary change in August deprived Pearce of all its territory outside the Perth metropolitan area. Once a mix of urban and rural, it has lost its Liberal-leaning regional component, leaving it as a “tradies’ electorate” with half of the voters new to the area. “It has the highest percentage of the workforce of any electorate in Australia employed in construction,” Bowe says. “The Liberal party would be worried that these new young families are going to flip en masse – and if they do, they are in big trouble in Pearce.” Porter won the seat with a 3.5% swing in 2019, but announced this month he would not stand again. Earlier this year he confirmed he was the subject of a historical rape allegation against an unnamed minister published by the ABC. Porter strenuously denied the allegation and settled a defamation case against the ABC after it published a statement indicating it did not intend to suggest Porter had committed the alleged offence. In September, Porter left the front bench after declaring he had received anonymous donations from a trust to help with his legal fees in the case, but insisted his declaration complied with the relevant rules. Before his decision to quit, internal party polling suggested Labor was ahead in the seat. Dr Yvonne Haigh, a public policy expert at Murdoch University, says it is crucial for the Liberals to preselect a woman, but that was no guarantee of winning. “There have been rallies in Perth with women demanding change and saying this is not good enough and [the Liberals] can’t ignore that. They know they have a problem around having enough female representatives to run for seats, even though they find it impossible to say ‘we need to adopt quotas’,” she says. Women make up 31% of the 151-member House of Representatives, and 53% of the 76-strong Senate, but the Liberals score worse than Labor for representation. On Sunday the federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told the ABC’s Insiders program the Liberals needed to do more to recruit female candidates. Martin Drum, a senior lecturer in politics at the University of Notre Dame, says with no sitting member and the Liberals beginning the preselection process late, Roberts would start favourite. “There’s no third-party candidate that has a realistic chance of winning,” Drum says. Pearce is a “very different ball game” at this election thanks to McGowan’s popularity, he says. “We have seen at state level that northern metropolitan area swung fairly vigorously at different times, depending on the election. “Mark McGowan did extremely well in that area at the state election.” The Greens and One Nation will also stand, but any independent campaign is unlikely. “It’s not a politically engaged electorate,” Bowe says. “Independents can emerge in seats like Wentworth and Kooyong, but they don’t tend to emerge in seats like this. “This is a two-horse race.”",News/Australia news,The battle for Pearce: who will replace Christian Porter in the Perth electorate?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/12/the-battle-for-pearce-who-will-replace-christian-porter-in-the-perth-electorate
12/12/2021,"Christopher Luxon’s shelves are empty. The solid frames that surround him are devoid of books, the broad expanse of his desk is largely uncluttered by papers, the old oak in and outboxes not yet packed with memos. The New Zealand opposition leader’s office still shouts of being recently and unceremoniously vacated, and its new occupant hasn’t yet made a mark. “I just literally moved into the office in the last three or four days,” Luxon says, circling to the window for a portrait. It’s been a rapid ascension for the MP, catapulted from the pokier reaches of the opposition floors – “the smallest office in the building,” he says – to the polished-wood expanses of leader’s office. “I’m going to get rid of all this horrible wooden furniture,” he says, glancing around. “I don’t like the stuffiness of it, to be brutally honest with you.”  Luxon’s redecorating task extends far beyond these walls. He has promised to revamp the National party, which has spent 18 months troubled by bleak polling, internal strife and leadership woes. In his first speech as leader, he vowed to rescue the party from the doldrums. “We are the reset,” he announced from behind the podium. “National is back.” That comeback may be a tough one. Luxon was shunted into the top job ahead of schedule by the implosion of former leader Judith Collins – an iron-willed, experienced political player whose leadership collapsed very publicly last month, when she was dumped by the party after an ill-fated attempt to demote a political rival on the basis of what she alleged were inappropriate comments from 2017. Luxon, a former chief executive of Air New Zealand who has been in politics for just one year, was heralded as a promising hope for New Zealand’s centre right when he entered parliament. He now takes the helm much earlier than he or his supporters may have wished, transitioning in an unprecedentedly short timeframe from newly minted New Zealand MP to major party leader. As well as uniting a fractious caucus – including three ex-leaders with varying degrees of personal ambition – he’s tasked with going head to head with prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who won a majority victory at the last election, and has seen off four opposition leaders so far. In the face of this, Luxon is relentlessly chipper, and unfailingly on-message. “If you look at our history over the last four years, there’s been a lot of dysfunction, I guess, is the simplest way to describe it,” he says of the party. “What’s been exciting about this week is that we came together as a team, we had a seamless leadership transition, and we ended up going forward as one unified team.” He does not blink at the phrase “seamless leadership transition”. So far, commentators on the right have been cautiously pleased with his performance – no major flubs marking his early days, nothing to pull the rug from beneath hopes that he could prove a viable foil to Ardern. Luxon pitches his lack of experience in parliament as a strength. “That’s what this reset has been about,” he says. “To leave the baggage in the past, to turn the page and to go forward.” Instead, he is leaning heavily on his experience in the corporate world, which he says will help him achieve ‘results’ where other politicians bluster. A lack of results is one of his primary lines of attack on Ardern whom he says leads a government of “spin and PR,” rather than action. “The prime minister is a very effective communicator, but actually the country needs a lot more than that right now,” he says. “ People actually want to see outcomes and results.” It’s a criticism that has been levelled at the Ardern administration from the left as well as the right – on some key, long-brewing issues, the government has struggled for traction. Declaration of a climate emergency has not resulted in a drop in New Zealand’s emissions; on the housing affordability crisis, a slew of reforms have not stopped Auckland prices increasing by an average $113,000 over the past three months; on mental health, a $1.9bn investment largely failed to flow through to essential services. The country’s Covid response has produced some of the best public health results in the world, but is now entering its most difficult and uncertain stages. “I think the New Zealand public are … looking for someone to speak up on some of the frustrations at the moment – so far, he’s been able to articulate that message quite well,” says Brigitte Morton, a ministerial adviser in the last National government. “I think he’s going to be quite a worthy opponent for Ardern.” What remains to be seen is whether Luxon has clear alternatives to offer. “He’s coming in with an optimistic, if unfilled-in, vision,” says Ben Thomas, a political commentator and former National government staffer and press secretary. “What there isn’t a lot of is detail,” Thomas says, “in particular, the things that will later become relevant – like his individual policy positions.” In these early interviews, Luxon’s style can sometimes resemble his office shelves. The essential architecture of a political leader is there – a backstory, a ready grin, vision statements, a fondness for the phrase “fundamentally” – but the shelves are sometimes unstocked, especially with particulars. On home territory, discussing New Zealand’s need to increase productivity and improve infrastructure – he is comfortable. Elsewhere, his statements can turn vague. On foreign policy, he will not be drawn on New Zealand’s standing in the Five Eyes security network; the specifics on whether New Zealand should risk angering China, its largest trade partner in joining the US-led diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics. On the subject of his evangelical faith – a relatively unusual designation in New Zealand political leadership – and how it could inform his approach to conscience votes like abortion, euthanasia and legalisation of cannabis, he again deploys broader brushstrokes. “I want to be the prime minister of New Zealand, who just happens to have faith – not actually be the faith prime minister of New Zealand,” he says. “I have a personal faith, I haven’t been to a church for five years. It’s fundamentally something personal to me, it gives me purpose, it gives me meaning, it puts me in a context of something bigger than myself. And I think that’s a good thing.” He does note that he has no plans to relitigate abortion reform, which he says was “settled” by the last parliament. On housing, like his political peers, he is unwilling to say whether house prices should drop – although even a 30% drop in prices would only return Auckland to the heady days of March 2020. “It’s a difficult one to answer, that question, in terms of should house prices fall – we definitely want to see house prices become more affordable for everybody,” he says. “There may be a period of time where house prices do go backwards, frankly, but over the long run, we want to see slow, stable, steady growth, not strong double digit growth.” Luxon himself owns seven properties, one of the largest and most valuable property portfolios in parliament. He says that does not put him out of touch with the New Zealanders that don’t own a home. In the coming months, the new leader’s challenge will be to fill in the gaps in his vision. “People will expect big things from him quickly – so time is not on his side,” says Shane Te Pou, a political commentator and former Labour party activist. Then again, he says. “The National party needed a change. Certainly they’re much better off than they were two weeks ago.” Thomas says for now, the broad brush strokes are likely all Luxon needs: he has the quiet weeks of New Zealand’s summer to do the strategic work of fleshing out a policy vision for the party, and learning to articulate it. “The challenge for him will be being able to react instinctively and fleet-footedly in essentially a 24/7 media environment now, where politicians are expected to be across and have opinions on a great deal of subjects,” Thomas says. For someone shifting from relatively low-profile portfolios to spokesperson for the party, that could prove tricky. “His biggest challenge will be the unity of caucus,” Morton says. And Luxon says this will be his first focus. “I’ve seen lots of political parties have a very charismatic leader and a very poor team and they do very poorly,” he says. “[I’m] doing a lot of things for the first time, because I am new to politics. But it has underscored to me the value of teamwork and the belief fundamentally that politics is a team sport.” Among the party faithful, Thomas says, Luxon’s ascendance has had “a galvanizing effect” – even if it hasn’t reached the heights provoked by Ardern’s emergence from her struggling party ahead of the 2017 election. “Rather than pure excitement, the emotional response has been leavened with relief.”",News/World news,‘An unfilled-in vision’: can Christopher Luxon lead New Zealand’s National party back to power?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/an-unfilled-in-vision-can-christopher-luxon-lead-new-zealands-national-party-back-to-power
12/12/2021,"No one admits to being a “neoliberal”. You cannot vote for the Neoliberal party or join a neoliberal club. Like 21st-century fascism and religious fundamentalism, neoliberalism is a movement without declared adherents. If you call opponents “fascist” or a “fundamentalist”, however, at least your audience knows you are condemning them. A “neoliberal” though? Most people won’t know what you are talking about, but will guess that it doesn’t sound such a bad thing to be. The exceptions will be the minority immersed in leftwing thought. They alone are primed to shudder at the sound of the word.  Insults that only the initiated comprehend are closer to a secret code than an open argument. Like the changes in approved terms for disadvantage – don’t say “able-bodied”, say “non-disabled” – the effect, if not the intention, is to belittle ordinary people and make them feel they are gauche or worse for not keeping up with the latest linguistic fashions. Given that losing is the standard experience of the centre-left, throwing out language that excludes the majority of the population strikes me as an overdue necessity. The more so when a new collection of essays by modern historians suggests that supposed insiders may not understand what neoliberalism means either. The Neoliberal Age? Britain since the 1970s is well worth reading and not only because the generous publishers allow you to download it free. Although most of the contributors agree that the rise to power of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher represented a break with the past, they contest everything else. Were they really preceded by a social democratic golden age? (The movements to empower women, ethnic minorities and gays and lesbians did not think so.) Were changes we explain by looking at political decisions the result of shifts in ideology or the shift from manufacturing to service economies that affected every developed nation, regardless of who was in power? The doctrines of Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek are meant to be distinct from traditional apologetics for unrestrained capitalism. Nineteenth-century economic liberals wanted a minimal state. But the neoliberals of the 20th century wanted to empower the state to create and uphold markets and competition. As history, this is tediously sentimental. The British state presided over the world’s first capitalist economy. It used its empire as a captive market and went to war with China to allow the free trade in drugs to flourish. You can call it many things but it was not a minimal state. In the 1960s, during the supposed Trente Glorieuses of the social democratic age, the Bank of England and the Foreign Office enabled the creation of tax havens that allowed plutocrats, corporations and criminals to hoard their money with disastrous and enduring consequences for humanity. I could go on, but the cliquey language remains my main concern: not just for what it conceals, but for what it unwittingly reveals. Like so much insider jargon, neoliberal is a pathetically weak term. To take an everyday example: since Thatcher’s government privatised the water industry in 1989, managers and shareholders have exploited their monopoly power to take almost £60bn in profit. In 2020, the companies spent 3.1m hours dumping sewage into rivers. So great has been their failure to reinvest even a small portion of the money they take, south-east England may soon face water shortages. I accept that no mid-20th-century government would have contemplated handing over water companies to negligent profiteers. But to call today’s politicians and regulatory authorities, who sit back while monopolists cover the countryside in excrement, “neoliberals” is to let them off lightly. Russians would never use such a mild term of the men Vladimir Putin has let loose. They capture the banditry of crony capitalism by talking of robbers, looters and frauds. I can’t speak for academia, but in politics I know that the cry “neoliberal” is a certain sign that I am in the presence of the far left. It must maintain there is no difference between Tony Blair’s Labour government and any government Keir Starmer may lead, and the Tories. I once believed that, but the brutality of David Cameron’s actual Conservative government made me think again. So, too, did the arguments for apathy or despair behind apparently radical sloganising. Only moderate centre-left parties have won elections in western countries and their victories are rare enough. If you insist that they are as much a part of a neoliberal conspiracy as the right, then there is no point in fighting to remove the right from power. As seriously, a belief in neoliberal hegemony ducks the question whether it makes sense to think of today’s right as neoliberal. I can see the idea’s appeal. Boris Johnson and his wife are openly for sale. Whether they want new wallpaper or home-delivered dinners, their first instinct is to sponge off rich donors, who may well entertain the hope that their favours will be returned. None of his personal corruptions, however, can hide the truth that Johnson is a nationalist, who appeals to deep chauvinist sentiments rather than class interests. No economic liberal, neo or otherwise, would pull the UK out of the world’s richest single market. Conservatives fooled themselves that Brexit would bring a deregulated society. But we should pay more attention to the world as it is than to the fantasies of the delusional and see that, instead of a Singapore-on-Thames, they have undermined exporters and brought tax to its highest level since the 1960s, an era the Thatcher revolution supposedly finished off. Far from being a spur to entrepreneurial dynamism, the Conservative party is the party of the people who have stopped working, rather than the party of businesses and their workers. Johnson and ministers stroke the prejudices of his core pensioner vote and put their economic interests first. I cannot imagine the ghost of Friedman applauding a government that raises taxes on employers and employees to protect the property of wealthy retirees. You won’t beat them with obscurantist labels voters don’t understand and you may well not understand either. You won’t beat them until you understand them and when you do you will realise that whatever else they are they are not neoliberals.

12/12/2021,"Eight refugees – held by Australia’s offshore immigration regime for more than eight years – have landed in Vancouver and Toronto, sponsored by community groups in Canada and Australia to begin new lives on the other side of the world. The eight flew out of the Papua New Guinea capital Port Moresby on Thursday, joining another former Manus detainee who arrived in Canada a week ago.  Abdo had been medevaced from PNG to Australia before being accepted for resettlement in Canada. “I have mixed feelings about starting this new life in Canada,” Abdo says. “It was hard leaving my friends in Australia. I wish I could have stayed. “Thank you for all [the] people that made it possible for me to become a permanent resident of Canada, I am looking forward to a bright new future. To all my Aussie friends, come [for a] visit.” The nine have been accepted for resettlement under Canada’s Private Sponsorship of Refugees scheme, which allows community groups to privately sponsor refugees to resettle in Canada, in addition to the government’s own humanitarian resettlement quotas. The scheme, which has been running for more than 40 years, has allowed more than 300,000 refugees to restart their lives in Canada. Six of the eight refugees who landed in Canada on Saturday (Australian time) were resettled through Operation #NotForgotten, a community sponsorship partnership between the Refugee Council of Australia, the Vancouver-based migrant and refugee settlement service Mosaic, and volunteer network Ads Up Canada. The other two have been sponsored by community volunteers supported by Ads Up Canada. The eight left PNG just three weeks ahead of Australia formally ending its eight-year offshore immigration regime in PNG. More than 100 people remain held there by Australia. Abdo – the Guardian is choosing only to publish his first name – was incarcerated on Manus Island, medevaced to Australia suffering acute medical issues, and then granted a temporary visa to live in the Australian community while awaiting resettlement. He landed in Vancouver on 6 December. Those resettled are the first of an expected steady stream of Canadian resettlements from within Australia’s offshore immigration system. Another four refugees currently held by Australia will arrive in Canada over the next month. Travel arrangements for a further three newly approved applicants is currently being arranged. The Refugee Council chief executive, Paul Power, says the resettlement of refugees from within Australia’s onshore and offshore immigration detention systems is the result of “ordinary people in Australia and Canada working together to find a solution for refugees who needed the opportunity to get on with the rest of their lives after years of mistreatment by the Australian government”. “These eight people sought sanctuary in Australia after escaping oppression in their homelands, as was confirmed when their refugee status was assessed,” he says. “Instead of being helped by Australia, they were put into detention under appalling conditions and have spent years not knowing what the future held for them and their families.” Australians have donated more than $3.8m to Operation #NotForgotten through the Refugee Council. Mosaic and Ads Up Canada have lodged sponsorship applications with the Canadian government and organised volunteer groups to support refugees after arrival. Since November 2019, applications for 156 refugees – in PNG, Australia and Nauru – and 125 separated family members have been lodged through Operation #NotForgotten. “Australians concerned about the mistreatment of the refugees sent to PNG and Nauru are very grateful to the people and government of Canada for providing a welcome and a new home for people who need the opportunity to live in freedom and start again,” Power said. Iris Challoner, the manager of Mosaic’s private sponsorship program, says the private sponsorship program is transformative, both for refugees beginning lives in new countries and the communities they are welcomed into. “Our team is privileged and honoured to have gotten to know so many Australians that are a force for better and take a stand for human rights. Ordinary Australians have made this unique collaboration possible; they saw suffering and found solutions where they could. This is what makes Operation #NotForgotten unique: it is a true collaboration of civic society across continents.” The Australian government has, for several years, speculated about implementing a scheme based on Canada’s model, which has been resettling refugees since 1979. In Canada, private sponsors, which are often community, humanitarian or faith groups, commit to providing income support for refugees for the first year after arrival. Currently, it costs the equivalent of A$21,500 to sponsor a single refugee, or A$36,500 for a family of five. Other countries have adopted the model. In October, the US, after decades of only government-sponsored resettlement, announced a Sponsor Circle Program for Afghans, specifically to assist with the resettlement of more than 50,000 Afghans currently being housed in military bases across the US, some of those who made it onto flights out of Kabul as the country fell to the Taliban. Ireland, the UK and New Zealand have committed to or established similar schemes. Australia’s Community Support Program was launched in 2017 as a pilot program, set at 1,000 places to be drawn from within Australia’s humanitarian migration program. Crucially, it was not additional to the government’s resettlement programs – every place sponsored by a community group would subtract one from the government number. Australia’s pilot – as the government’s own reviews have conceded – is riven with systemic flaws. The Australian program is: small, limited to just 1,000 places a year; expensive, more than three times the cost of comparable schemes overseas, costing about $100,000 to sponsor a family of five, with an application fee alone of $19,000; restrictive – available only to refugees between 18 and 50 who have functional English and a job offer in Australia or skills that make them “job ready”, and critically, not additional: any refugee sponsored by the community subtracts by one from the government’s resettlement commitment. The Department of Home Affairs’ own review of its existing Community Support Program this year found it was structurally flawed, and ineffective in resettling significant numbers of refugees.

The findings, presented to the government in May, said “community organisations generally report being unwilling to engage in (and bear high financial costs for) sponsorship without it generating places in addition to the current humanitarian intake”. In a speech last year, Larkins said international evidence demonstrated “governments alone can’t make the difference”. “In Canada, you can directly see the importance of community in creating economic participation for refugees through their community sponsorship model,” she said. “Seventy per cent of privately sponsored refugees in Canada declared employment earnings within their first year of arrival compared to 40% of government assisted refugees.” Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, has previously said he was a “strong supporter of the community support program”. A spokesperson for the home affairs department said the government was “currently considering the findings of the review and anticipates being able to offer a further update soon”. “The government looks forward to ensuring Australia’s Community Support Program becomes a genuine, successful partnership between community, business and the government, to provide beneficial outcomes to our refugee and humanitarian arrivals in Australia.” Challoner says the nature of Canada’s private sponsorship program “sets people up for success”. “Sponsors commit to 12 months of sponsorship support. As a result, privately sponsored refugees arrive with a built-in social support system. They have a safe and clean place to live, and a team of people who become family, supporting all aspects of their settlement experience. “Done right, private refugee sponsorship can change attitudes across the world about refugees, re-unify families that are separated … It enables ordinary citizens to truly make a difference … to be the change they want to see.”",News/Australia news,‘A bright new future’: how Australians are helping Canada’s private sponsors give refugees a fresh start,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/12/a-bright-new-future-how-australians-are-helping-canadas-private-sponsors-give-refugees-a-fresh-start

Initially boarding with a family, she got a job and struck out with a friend, only to discover that the rental market wanted nothing to do with her.  “Every real estate agent we applied to said: ‘You are asylum seekers, you don’t have a permanent residency, you don’t have the documents that we are asking for,’” Mariah tells Guardian Australia. “And above all, we don’t have anyone to reference or stand as witness for us.” The pair were only able to secure a rental property by responding to an ad on Facebook Marketplace – a granny flat more than 25km west of the Sydney CBD, for $700 a fortnight. Even that was fraught. “Because it was between me and the family, it was difficult – they knew we were not permanent residents,” Mariah says. “So every three months they ask for documents like your visa – ‘is your visa expired?’ So we are under pressure.” Mariah’s experience is not unique. Asylum seekers routinely experience housing insecurity, homelessness, chronic financial insecurity and the constantly looming threat of eviction from formal and informal tenancies, according to a new report from Jesuit Refugee Services and the University of Western Sydney. The study, A Place to Call Home, involved conducting in-depth interviews with a small group of asylum seekers accessing support services in western Sydney, followed by a broader survey. There is very little data about asylum seekers’ experience of homelessness in Australia. Most of the existing research relates to those who have already had refugee status granted, says Elizabeth Conroy, senior research fellow at the Translational Health Research Institute and co-author of the report. “We knew it was an issue. Services were telling us that trying to find housing for people was problematic,” she says. “And it was certainly something that came up a lot among my clients when I was volunteering as a trauma counsellor at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre.” The restrictive conditions of bridging visas mean many asylum seekers are not eligible to access public or community housing, or federally funded income support. The drawn out nature of the refugee status determination process means that even those who are in the “fast track” category routinely wait years for their claim to be settled. In the meantime, real estate agents invariably knock back their rental applications because they are not permanent residents, even when they have money in their bank account, are employed in ongoing work and otherwise make a good impression. Many have no choice but to seek off-the-books, informal or ad hoc subletting arrangements, in which permanent residents or Australian citizens agree to secure the lease in their own name, with the asylum seeker paying rent to the lessee. These situations are routinely disempowering, with asylum seekers compromising privacy and personal safety concerns for a roof over their heads, the report found. Women often find themselves in particularly coercive situations, with the threat of violence or their housing insecurity used as a lever to induce them into relationships they do not want. Mariah had to leave the granny flat in western Sydney when her flatmate moved states. She alone couldn’t keep up with the rent. She found another house via a subletting arrangement, but then Covid hit. Mariah’s visa gave her the right to work but not to access jobseeker or any other commonwealth income support schemes. Her landlord refused to reduce the rent, and she was forced to vacate again. What followed was three months of severe hardship and very little employment. “I was squatting with friends, sleeping wherever the night met me,” Mariah says. “It was very, very difficult for me at that time.” Joseph* had a similar experience. When Covid came, he was working casually in the hospitality sector and living in an off-the-lease arrangement in an apartment with a housemate. His job evaporated with the lockdowns, and consequently so did his accommodation. A charity provided him a bed in some emergency accommodation – a small apartment that already housed five other men. Social distancing there was impossible. “People seeking asylum are going through two different pandemics,” Joseph says. “Housing and homelessness, and Covid-19 itself.” Mariah and Joseph are both concerned about coercive sexual relationships they have seen develop in the asylum seeker community as a consequence of people’s experience of housing insecurity. It is even harder for those with children, particularly single mothers, they say. Many asylum seekers are unable to access childcare support payments, but without childcare they are unable to work, which leaves them and their families extremely vulnerable. “Asylum seekers are constrained in their ability to generate an income and live independently, and at the same time, they’re excluded from support,” Conroy says. “You can’t take away rights without providing support. You can’t create dependency and then not even provide the support to respond to that.” The report calls for income support to be extended to asylum seekers who cannot work or who are unable to find work, as well as access to social housing and other government housing support services. In the meantime, the toll on the asylum seeker community is heavy. “Mental health is something that is buckling in the African community, especially people that are seeking asylum,” Joseph says. “Housing and homelessness is one of the underlying factors of that. “Asylum seekers have a valid visa to live and stay in Australia. Services that help them live a dignified life should be made applicable to them.” * Guardian Australia has used pseudonyms in this story for safety reasons",News/Australia news,‘I was squatting’: why asylum seekers so often struggle to find secure housing,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/12/i-was-squatting-why-asylum-seekers-so-often-struggle-to-find-secure-housing
12/12/2021,"Andrew Yeo doesn’t know what’s happened to tens of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency belonging to hundreds of clients of the collapsed exchange ACX, but he aims to find out. In mid-October the veteran insolvency practitioner was appointed administrator of Blockchain Global, the company that used to run ACX, and since then he’s been getting a crash course in all things crypto from the tech experts at the firm where he’s a partner, Pitcher Partners.  “There’s always stuff that’s different – you have that on every job,” he says. “Its always about finding out what’s different about this industry and how you can use it.” A cryptocurrency exchange is digital marketplace that enables customers to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies. It makes money through set fees or by taking a percentage of transactions. No mainstream banks in Australia allow customers to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, although the Commonwealth bank has a pilot in the works, so exchanges are currently the only means to do this. To get to the bottom of what has happened to the cash and coins held in the accounts of ACX customers, Yeo will need to cut through a jungle of claims and counter-claims that have been playing out in court since last year. “It’s clear that there’s a number of channels of investigation which we may have available and determining which ones are best to follow first is not a simple task,” he says. There’s plenty at stake. Since Yeo’s appointment, creditors, including ACX clients and Blockchain Global’s directors and management, have come forward with claims they are owed close to $50m. ACX is not the only Australian exchange to run into trouble in what is – for now – a completely unregulated industry. Last week, the smaller exchange Mycryptowallet also fell into administration, reportedly owing clients hundreds of thousands of dollars. Globally, exchanges have proven vulnerable to failure and theft; Japanese operation Mt Gox collapsed in 2014 after someone stole 850,000 bitcoins from it and in 2016 hackers stole almost 120,000 bitcoins from the British Virgin Islands group Bitfinex, which managed to survive and still exists today. It’s not suggested that ACX’s assets have been stolen. This week, the Morrison government announced plans to regulate exchanges – some time in the future. In a speech on Thursday to the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the government would consult on establishing a licensing system for digital currency exchanges, together with regulation of businesses that hold custody of crypto on behalf of customers. The consultation process is due to be finished by the middle of next year, after an election that must be held by 21 May 2022. Experts say licensing exchanges is a good idea, but it needs to be backed up by enforcement. “With regulation comes a halo, businesses can say they’ve got a stamp of approval, and represent that people should have trust and confidence in them,” says the chief executive of the Consumer Action Law Centre, Gerard Brody. “The regulatory regime itself has got to be robust. It’s no good having a licence given to a business if the standards it’s got to meet under that licence result in consumer detriment.” Pamela Hanrahan, a professor of commercial law and regulation at the University of New South Wales, says licensing creates a “moral hazard”. “It does carry some kind of colour to it that people are properly regulated, but that’s true of every form of occupational licensing, from hairdressing to whatever,” she says. She points to failures such as the financial planning scandals that rocked the banking industry in the mid-2010s, and the 2009 Trio Capital failure, which deprived retirement savers of $176m and was the biggest superannuation collapse in Australian history, as examples of where licensing regimes have failed to safeguard consumers. “You do have to enforce it properly,” she says. Victims of ACX’s collapse certainly feel they’ve been neglected by regulators including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. In a lawsuit filed in the Victorian supreme court, 94 of them claim Blockchain Global, as operator of the exchange, owes them $13m worth of tokens including bitcoin, ethereum and ripple, as well as cash held in their ACX accounts. “The biggest thing I’m angry about is that we’re not getting any help from Asic,” one ACX client says. “These companies are registered with Asic but … we have to sue the company.” Not all of ACX’s clients are participating in the lawsuit and all up there are estimated to be more than 200 who claim to have lost access to crypto and cash held at the exchange. On Thursday afternoon, judge Richard Attiwill stayed the proceeding against Blockchain Global due to Yeo’s appointment as administrator. However, he allowed it to continue against the other defendants in the case, including Blockchain Global chief executive, Allan Guo, and the company’s chief financial officer, Samuel Lee. Guo and Lee did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia and they are yet to file defences in the matter. Meanwhile, in another dispute also before the Victorian supreme court, Blockchain Global and Guo are fighting a former company employee, Jin Chen, over control of 117 bitcoins. Chen claims that he is owed the crypto for work developing software to run the ACX exchange, but the company and Guo say Chen has failed to comply with a deal that was supposed to end the stoush, because he did not make the source code of the software accessible. Chen denies this. On Thursday afternoon Attiwill also stayed Chen’s claim against the company in light of the appointment of the administrator, but allowed the contest between Chen and Guo to go ahead. The issues are less clear at the smaller Mycryptowallet, which is in the hands of liquidator Terry van der Velde of SV Partners. SV Partners says little information is available because the appointment is “at very early stages” but van der Velde aims to sell the business. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Hanrahan says the collapses make government regulation of exchanges an urgent need. “They need to act reasonably quickly,” she says – but not so quickly that the laws fail in the same way as ones covering financial services have. “It’s one thing to announce it, but you know, they’re going to have to deliver it and hopefully not make quite the mess of it that they’ve made of chapter seven of the Corporations Act [which regulates financial services],” she says. In the meantime, people who buy and sell crypto should realise that “they don’t have any inherent worth”. She believes cryptocurrencies are worse investments than the tulip bulbs that changed hands for fortunes during the tulipmania that gripped the Dutch in the 17th century, an episode in history that’s regarded as a classic example of a speculative bubble. “At least if you bought a tulip bulb you can plant it and grow a tulip,” she says. “These things don’t do anything.”",News/Technology,The search is on for $50m in lost cryptocurrency after two Australian exchanges collapse,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/12/the-search-is-on-for-50m-in-lost-cryptocurrency-after-two-australian-exchanges-collapse
12/12/2021,"The likelihood of users dying from drugs such as heroin has increased 55% since the Conservative party came to power in 2010, according to research that suggests the government’s new drug strategy will merely begin to restore some of the support it dismantled in the first place. A University College London (UCL) and University of Bristol study, published on Saturday, indicates that the high-profile strategy will start to repair some of the damage caused by Tory cuts to drug treatment services since 2010, a decade during which thousands died from an overdose. The 10-year strategy was unveiled last week by prime minister Boris Johnson, promising local authorities in England £780m for the drug treatment system.  It follows an ongoing rise in drug deaths in England and Wales to their highest level since records began in 1993, with 4,561 people dying last year. In a study to be published in the Lancet Public Health medical journal, researchers attempted to definitively answer why drug deaths had risen over the last decade. Their findings dispel one of the most common explanations: that as the population of opioid users ages, the chances of them dying increases. Instead, the study argues that “disinvestment” in drug treatment services was a potential key factor, noting that a government-sponsored review last year concluded services were struggling to meet the basic needs of users. The report says: “The increasing number of fatal drug poisonings over the past 10 years in the population is not explained by population ageing. “Community drug treatment services are sometimes the only point of contact between people who use illicit opioids and health services, and cuts in funding have meant that these now provide a narrow range of services with little scope for holistic care.” Dan Lewer, research fellow at UCL’s department of epidemiology and public health, said a reduction in the availability of treatments such as methadone for drug addiction was a prime factor. He said: “I would argue that, based on the big protective benefit of those services like methadone, and the big increased risk of death when people leave that treatment, that it’s the prime candidate for that increased risk.” Lewer said the government’s 2012 Health Act, which transferred much public health work from the NHS to councils – whose budgets were cut by a third – meant crucial drug support and treatments were badly weakened. In 2012, there were 2,597 drug poisoning deaths registered, more than 40% fewer than the latest figures. Lewer added that while the potential to mend some of the harm inflicted over the last decade was “absolutely crucial”, some of the strategy’s language was unhelpful, such as its frequent references to “drug misuse”. He said: “The language is stigmatising and talks about addicts, criminals, and punishment. That’s not helpful and pushes people further to the margins of society. It’s in everyone’s interest to support this group and invest in needle exchanges, good quality treatment, and services that actually help.” The strategy has also drawn criticism for being presented by politicians, including the prime minister, as part of a crackdown on middle-class drug users. Experts and the police say the issue cannot be defined or targeted along class boundaries. The study also found that heroin users are much less likely to engage with health services, which meant they are twice as likely to die from chronic health problems such as cancer and heart disease than from an overdose. Compared with people of the same age in the general population, those who use heroin are three times more likely to die due to cancer, and four times more likely to die from heart disease, with homelessness, poverty and mental health problems being a factor. Lewer added that the study’s statistical analysis only went up to 2018 because data becomes less reliable after that year, although researchers said there was no indication the chances of dying from a drugs overdoses have since reduced. Promoting the strategy last Monday, the health secretary Sajid Javid said that more than half of people dependent on opiate and crack cocaine were not engaged in treatment and needed to be addressed.
