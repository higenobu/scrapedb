5/14/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gavin Newsom said Friday that his state has a record $97.5 billion operating surplus, as high tax rates on its wealthiest residents mean he has more cash to fund liberal priorities such as education and health care.

Of that windfall, lawmakers can tap $49.2 billion for any purpose. That figure surpasses the staggering $38 billion that they had at their disposal during the previous budget season, then considered the biggest. The surplus is “simply without precedent,” Newsom, a first-term Democrat up for re-election this year, said as he unveiled a $227.4 billion budget for the next fiscal year beginning in July. While billionaires such as Elon Musk have derided California’s high taxes as they decamped to low-tax states such as Texas, the progressive tax system rakes in more revenue when income rises for its wealthiest residents. That group has reaped the benefits of rising stock prices and stable employment even as many lower-income workers lost their jobs in the pandemic. For capital gains realizations alone, California expects to collect a record $291 billion for 2021, budget documents show. “It’s a sign of how well a number of people are doing in this economy,” Newsom said. “I’m proud of California’s progressive tax system and we’re the beneficiaries of that.” This lopsided tax structure, in which the top 1% of earners pay nearly half of personal income-tax collections, also means revenue could plummet severely in an economic downturn. Indeed, capital gains as a share of the personal income collections are at levels last seen shortly before the dot-com bust. Newsom said he is “deeply mindful” of prospects of a slowdown. More than 90% of the surplus would go to one-time spending items, he said. Reserves, including constitutionally mandated deposits, total $37.1 billion. Newsom also proposes paying off $3.5 billion of bonds early -- an idea pitched by Wall Street -- and using cash instead of selling debt to finance some capital projects. Newsom’s spending plan also allocates billions of dollars to providing checks to residents to offset rising costs, subsidizing health care and fortifying the state’s energy grid and responses to climate change. In what Newsom called the biggest inflation package in the country, the state would send $400 refunds to personal car and truck owners, with a maximum of $800 for up to two cars. Legislators have proposed broader taxpayer relief based on income. Asked about the potential of his surplus spending causing inflation to spike even more, Newsom said he didn’t think there would be a “significant impact.” The governor said offsetting costs for residents is “wise and noble, and it’s something I think that should be celebrated and not criticized.” While Democrats have a supermajority in both legislative chambers, their priorities have at times diverged from Newsom’s. Lawmakers last month declined to act on the governor’s request to delay an annual inflation-indexed fuel tax increase set for June, saying they saw “pitfalls” in the temporary move. Some of Newsom’s proposals are “encouraging,” said Senate President pro Tempore Toni Atkins and Senator Nancy Skinner, chair of the budget committee, in a joint statement. “Others, as happens every year, will require more discussion and negotiation.” Lawmakers have to approve a budget by June 15 or forgo pay. Newsom’s spending plans include: $11.5 billion to every eligible registered vehicle owner, capped at two $400 checks per individual $2.7 billion for emergency rental assistance $2 billion for affordable housing production $1.4 billion for overdue utility bills $933 million for hospital and nursing home staff $750 million for free public transit $125 million to bolster access to reproductive health services (Updates budget proposals in ninth paragraph) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Mexico’s Hottest Resort Towns Struggle With Covid Travel Boom What Happened When a Wall Street Investment Giant Moved to Nashville Starbucks Baristas Are Unionizing, and Even Howard Schultz Can’t Make Them Stop Crypto’s Fall, in Three Charts The Investing Party May Be Over, But Markets Might Make Sense Again ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•3 hours ago,"California Sees Record $97.5 Billion Surplus, Driven by the Rich",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-governor-sees-record-97-171620021.html
5/14/2022,"According to Wells Fargo, the rest of 2022 looks good for the price of gold. Thanks to hot inflation, geopolitical uncertainty and a crashing stock market, the banking giant sees gold as the next big opportunity for investors — particularly in relation to bitcoin. ""On the store-of-value front, bitcoin has been getting much of the attention lately, but we think gold may be the next play,” Wells Fargo’s head of real asset strategy John LaForge says. “Gold's price chart appears to be slowly grinding higher, while bitcoin's price has been stuck in a wide $30K to $69K range for the past 12 months.” Wells Fargo believes that bitcoin has gold beat in ease of use, storage, and verifiability, but gold’s physical nature and universal recognition still make it a popular safe-haven asset. ""The bottom line is that we still like gold and are maintaining our 2022 year-end target price range of $2,000-$2,100 per ounce.” Here are three gold stocks to play that bullish gold outlook. Barrick Gold is a $37 billion sector-leading gold company. It operates mines in 18 countries across the world with a focus on high-margin, long-life assets. Barrick’s Q1 results reflect that asset quality, as well as the company’s success in driving profitability and shareholder value. During the quarter, free cash flow clocked in at $393 million. On the strength of those results, Barrick doubled its quarterly dividend. The stock currently offers a dividend yield of 1.9%. Gold Fields is a South African gold producer with a market cap of $12 billion. The company has total annual gold-equivalent production of 2.2 million ounces and gold-equivalent mineral reserves of 52.1 million ounces. Gold Fields’ operating efficiency is high and while the stock’s price multiples are low — a nice combination for prospective investors. In 2021, the company achieved a return on equity of 20% and generated adjusted free cash flow of $463 million. This performance is tied to the high quality of the company’s asset base, as well as solid execution by management. Meanwhile, the stock looks relatively inexpensive. Currently, it sports a P/E of 12 and offers a dividend yield of 2.8%. Gold companies often operate in politically unstable regions of the world. This political risk can outweigh any “safe-haven” benefits gained from investing in gold. If you don’t want to take on this added uncertainty, consider Agnico-Eagle Mines. Agnico is a Canadian senior gold company with a market cap of $23 billion. It boasts operations in relatively stable countries including Canada, Finland and Mexico. In 2021, the company posted record annual gold production, record annual operating cash flow of $1.3 billion record mineral reserves. Agnico also extended its impressive dividends-paid streak to 38 consecutive years. Currently, the stock offers a dividend yield of 3.0%.
