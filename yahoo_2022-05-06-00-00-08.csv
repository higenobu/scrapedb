5/6/2022,"Another parent is coming forward with a claim that her child had his hair pulled out at a metro day care. This is the second incident involving a the La Petite Day Care. Juley Cetoute showed Channel 2′s Larry Spruill the photos of her son’s scalp. The pictures revealed a large bald spot in his head. She said braids used to be there. “You can see the red hair follicles where they have been removed,” Cetoute said. Cetoute said she saw the bald spot in her 1-year-old son’s head when she picked up from the La Petite Academy on Indian Trail Road in Norcross on Mar. 24. “I noticed that his scalp, his hair has been pulled from his scalp. He had braids coming from the middle of his hair down to his ears,” Cetoute said. The mother told Spruill that she questioned the school numerous times about what happened. “One minute the school teachers said that he did it to himself, but when I asked for the incident report, the incident report states they don’t know what happened,” Cetoute said. Spruill reported about another incident where a 1-year-old girl’s hair was pulled out after she got stuck in a cubby at a La Petite location in Tyrone.

If something happens to a child specifically at a location, it’s their right to know what happened. I want this La Petite to be held accountable,” Cetoute said. The Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning is investigating the academy in Norcross for lack of supervision of a child. “I definitely have hope this time there will be more transparency with what’s happening,” Cetoute said. Channel 2 Action News reached out to La Petite Academy about this incident at the Norcross location. They released a statement, saying: “We strive to ensure that every child in our care has a great experience with us each day. Our policies and procedures are designed to make certain we’re providing a safe and nurturing learning environment in keeping with state regulatory guidelines.

5/6/2022,"ATLANTA (AP) — Tuesday's debate among Georgia Republican Senate candidates was predictably defined by the man who wasn't there — Herschel Walker. If the race wasn't dominated by Walker's football celebrity and Donald Trump endorsement, Gary Black, Latham Saddler, Kelvin King, Josh Clark and Jon McColumn might all be more viable candidates for the Republican nomination. But instead, each continued to try to scratch out a case for GOP voters to turn away from Walker and consider them in the May 24 primary as an alternative to take on Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock in November. “This is our fifth debate or forum he hasn’t showed up,"" said Saddler, a Navy veteran and former bank executive. “We need a leader or fighter that’s going to show up to defeat Raphael Warnock in November. Raphael Warnock is a very smooth operator, we got to see him in action this last election cycle.” The Atlanta Press Club, which sponsored the debate televised on Georgia Public Broadcasting, set out an empty podium for Walker, with the other candidates taking turns dunking on his absence. They aim to drag Walker into a runoff, hoping the frontrunner will not be able to float above the fray in a one-on-one matchup. Black, Georgia's elected agriculture commissioner, has made the sharpest attacks on Walker, saying Tuesday he's unelectable in November because of questions about his past including “domestic violence, stalking women, threatened shootouts with police, business deals that have gone sour.” Officers responding to a 2001 report that Walker was armed and scaring his estranged wife at a suburban Dallas home later noted that Walker “talked about having a shoot-out with police,” according to a police report revealed by the AP in February. In a protective order sought by his then-ex-wife in 2005, Walker was accused of repeatedly threatening her life. He's also faced questions about whether he's lied about graduating from the University of Georgia, about being the valedictorian at his high school and about whether he has inflated his business record. Walker has been open about his long struggle with mental illness and acknowledged violent urges. His campaign has dismissed the report of a shoot out and blamed the media for highlighting it. “Herschel Walker will not win in November, so selecting someone who can win, who has a record that can defeat Raphael Warnock should be the No. 1 priority,” Black said. Walker has dismissed calls to debate, telling a radio station on April 20 that his opponents were jealous. “Because right now Herschel’s going to win that seat,” Walker told WDUN-AM. “They can’t win it, so they’re going to the old politics where people are tired of that."" Walker spokesperson Mallory Blount posted on social media Tuesday night that Walker was meeting with voters in Burke County, near Augusta. “Hope y’all have fun obsessing over Herschel Walker at the debate!” she wrote on Twitter. At times, the candidates Tuesday had a standard Republican debate, all saying they would welcome a potential U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade and declaring they want a total ban on abortion. “I want to ask those people who are for abortion, I want to ask you this question, what did the baby do wrong to deserve to be killed?"" said McColumn, a retired brigadier general. Several candidates promised to cut federal spending as a way of combating inflation. Questioned about health care, Clark proclaimed his opposition to former President Barack Obama's health care reform, with the former state representative saying he wanted to promote patient choice. Saddler defended himself against charges from Clark that he's a former Democrat and a “global elitist,"" promoting his experience working in the White House during the Trump administration. King, a contractor and Air Force veteran, touted himself as the most well-rounded, while Clark noted he was the only candidate with legislative experience, saying he would “be the tie-breaking vote that could serve the citizens of Georgia from Day One.” Multiple candidates expressed varying degrees of skepticism that the 2020 election in Georgia was fairly won by President Joe Biden over Trump. Some repeated Trump's lies that the vote was stolen, despite the moderator pointing out that Trump's own attorney general said there was no significant evidence of fraud. But in the end, the focus came back to the empty podium, and the man who wasn't there. Saddler suggested that Walker, if he couldn't handle a Republican primary debate where candidates agreed on most things, wouldn't be up to bigger challenges. “I think a simple question for Herschel Walker is, what do you think the United States Senate does?” Saddler said. “It’s the deliberative body of Congress. It’s what you do as a United States Senator, you get up there and you debate ideas.... And Herschel Walker can’t get up here.”",Politics/Associated Press,Georgia GOP Senate debate focuses on Herschel Walker absence,https://news.yahoo.com/georgia-gop-senate-debate-focuses-012523262.html
