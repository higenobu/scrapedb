5/13/2022,"Tesco’s chief executive took home £4.75m in pay last year after being awarded the highest annual bonus by the supermarket since 2016 as pre-tax profits more than doubled as pandemic restrictions eased. Ken Murphy’s package included a £3.21m bonus while the finance director, Imran Nawaz, earned a £1.24m bonus – taking his total to £5.4m for the year including a £3.5m “golden hello” relating to bonuses he lost out on leaving his former employer, Tate & Lyle. Murphy, who joined the UK’s biggest supermarket chain in October 2020, could earn up to £10.7m this year, if he meets certain performance targets. Details of the payouts come as families struggle to cope with the rising cost of living, including hefty food inflation. The Tesco chairman, John Allan, said earlier this week that the UK was facing “real food poverty for the first time in a generation”. Allan said some of the supermarket’s customers were now asking staff to stop putting their groceries through the till once they had reached a certain total, leaving some items behind, as they ration food spending. He argued there was as an “overwhelming case” for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help those suffering the most from the cost of living crisis. Steve Golsby, the head of Tesco’s remuneration committee, said it was satisfied that the bonus pay outs were “appropriate and reflect performance over the respective performance periods. “We achieved this strong performance against a backdrop of significant change in the retail sector. Customers are faced with an increasing range of choices as to where, how and when to shop, with the Covid-19 pandemic accelerating a number of profound shifts in consumer behaviours. Our executive directors have successfully navigated this period of uncertainty as demonstrated in their performance this year,” he said. Andrew Speke at the High Pay Centre said the big executive payouts would not be well received by Tesco staff and customers. He said: “One of Britain’s best known companies awarding its top dog such a large pay package amid the cost of living crisis will not go down well with Tesco’s workers or its customers. Tesco should be spending this money on raising the pay of its workers to protect their living standards from rising inflation and keeping its food prices as low as possible, to ensure its loyal customers can still afford to shop there as food prices rocket across the board.” Murphy’s and Nawaz’s pay is dwarfed by a total of £10.5m paid out to Tesco’s former finance director Alan Stewart in the past year, including £8.58m from cashing in share awards related to historic performance by the business that matured on his exit on top of £1.95m in pay. Former chief executive Dave Lewis also continues to benefit from his time at Tesco with £1.89m from a deferred bonus and share award paid out last summer. Murphy will now be able to receive a bonus even if Tesco does not reach its profit ambitions after a change in the company’s rules. However his full payout will be subject to cutting food waste, increasing diversity and reducing the retailer’s carbon footprint for the first time. Tesco doubled pre-tax profits to more than £2bn last year but has warned on profits for this year as it faces a battle to “keep the cost of the weekly shop in check”. Last month Tesco said it would pay out about £50m in a “thank you” bonus to workers in stores, warehouses and customer contact centres and it recently promised to invest £200m to increase its rate of pay for shopfloor staff by 5.8% to a minimum £10.10 from 24 July. However, the supermarket has been criticised for taking away the right to additional sick pay for those with Covid from this month. Several chief executives of companies who were hit hard during the pandemic have been awarded bonuses for 2021. Whitbread, the owner of the Premier Inn hotels chain, this week reported that chief executive Alison Brittain’s pay had doubled year on year to £2.2m for 2021, including a £1m bonus. The 2021 bonus was paid despite shares in the company barely rising in value during the course of 2021. Whitbread’s share price remained more than a third below its pre-pandemic levels on Friday. Brittain also gave up a £729,000 bonus that had been deferred from 2020 to avoid a backlash after Whitbread accepted hundreds of millions of pounds of government aid through furlough payments and business rates relief.",News/Business,Tesco chief pockets £4.75m as shoppers face soaring prices,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/13/tesco-chief-soaring-prices-ken-murphy-profits
5/13/2022,"Standing seven storeys tall in Mayfair’s Hanover Square – a short walk from Savile Row, Oxford Street and Michelin-starred restaurants – there is little mistaking Vogue House for what it is: the home of the fashion bible’s British edition. However, a six-hour drive away, a pub in the Cornish countryside has become a site for concern for bosses at the fashion giant. Despite it standing for hundreds of years, the landlords have been asked to rename it. The Star Inn at Vogue, named for the hamlet in which it is situated, has received a message from the magazine’s owner asking for the change because a link between the two businesses “is likely to be inferred”. In a cease-and-desist letter delivered to the couple, Condé Nast’s chief operating officer, Sabine Vandenbroucke, argued the company is the proprietor of the Vogue mark, not only for the magazine first published in 1916, but “other goods and services offered to the public by our company”. At first, the pub’s landlords, Rachel and Mark Graham, were surprised. But it did not take long for their shock to dissolve to humour. “If someone had obviously taken the time to look us up, it wouldn’t have taken five minutes to say: ‘Oh, there’s a place called Vogue,’” said Rachel, 49, who is not a reader of the magazine. The letter, dated 1 March, said: “We are concerned that the name which you are using is going to cause problems because as far as the general public is concerned a connection between your business and ours is likely to be inferred.” The Star Inn has been in the small village of Vogue, near St Day, for hundreds of years, Mark wrote in his reply – in which he responded to the request with a “categorical no”. The letter was “hilariously funny”, he wrote. He believes it was sent in confusion after the couple changed their trading status to a limited company. He added: “I presume that at the time when you chose the name Vogue in the capitalised version you didn’t seek permission from the villagers of the real Vogue. I also presume that Madonna did not seek your permission to use the word Vogue (again the capitalised version) for her 1990s song of the same name.” The couple, who have run the pub for 17 years, replied to the letter within the seven-day timeframe demanded of them but are yet to receive a response. “We’re just a village community pub,” she added in an interview with the Guardian. “We do what we can to support the community.” The pub, nicknamed “the Vogue” by locals, is adorned with maps of the local area circa 1800, has remained largely unchanged – aside from a few upgrades and additions. Some regulars had been up in arms, Rachel said, and wanted to go to the local council with the desire to take the case further. “We’re not really interested in fighting” said Rachel. “We’re just pointing out the obvious that they should have looked it up themselves. It wouldn’t have taken much.” “Mistakes are made,” she added. “Some are just a bit funnier than others.” The pair bought the pub after going out for a bike ride and found it closed for the afternoon. They were disappointed to not be able to stop and have a pint. If they had the pub, they thought at the time, it would have been open. Not long after, an ad popped up in the local paper and they bought it. Condé Nast has been approached for comment.",News/UK news,‘Hilarious’: Cornish pub will not change name despite letter from Vogue owner,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/13/star-inn-vogue-cornish-pub-will-not-change-name-despite-letter-from-conde-nast
5/13/2022,"Hours after he stepped off stage with his political future in the balance, Keir Starmer decompressed with some of his closest friends and advisers for beers and prosecco in the garden of his former chief of staff, Jenny Chapman. “He looked better than he had in ages,” one said. “Sometimes you just have to let go.” The get-together was the old guard: Chapman and her husband, the MP Nick Smith; the former Labour MPs Gloria De Piero and Heidi Alexander; his former communications chief Ben Nunn; and campaign director Morgan McSweeney, one of the few of the original gang who is still at the heart of the Labour leader’s operation. Since he won the leadership, Starmer’s team has been almost completely overhauled after internal clashes and slow electoral progress. Many now say there is major improvement – shown in a professionalised local elections campaign – but the fallout from the Beergate scandal has been traumatising for some of the current team. “I think the new operation have had an easy ride so far,” a close ally of Starmer said. “There has been a honeymoon period of progress in the polls, the Tories in the doldrums. This is the first real test and frankly it’s not been good enough.” The new investigation by Durham police was a body blow after local elections results that were at the top end of expectations, despite a lukewarm write-up. In detailed internal and external analysis since the results, a far more positive picture has emerged than in the immediate aftermath. In a granular analysis, the Oxford professor Stephen Fisher found not only had Labour radically improved its electoral performance in London, but actually bounced back even further in communities that voted leave. Any celebration was impossible. Last Friday, Starmer had made up his mind to pledge to resign if fined, a decision that sources said blindsided some of those who he confided in, including his chief of staff Sam White and his director of strategy Deborah Mattinson. Most were shattered by the elections, sources admitted. By the end of the weekend, the Labour leader told his team they had not been able to give him “one single reason” why he shouldn’t make that promise. He had already sought guidance externally from his former advisers, frustrated with the impasse. Tensions exploded at the morning meeting on Monday – with recriminations between aides over why the party had not prepared more of a fightback against the tabloid campaign. “It’s not easy to tell your boss, ’Yes I think you should offer to resign,’” one official said. “But the job’s not meant to be easy.” Although the operation is running more smoothly since the chaotic botched reshuffle that split the team last year, there is tension between the “big brains” who want to plot a detailed strategic advance and those who have a more natural political instinct for opportunism, such as McSweeney and the MPs in charge of campaign strategy, Conor McGinn and Shabana Mahmood. They are also the group that has been the loudest arguing for giving no quarter to the party’s left – which make some shadow cabinet ministers uneasy – although Starmer takes very little convincing to be hardline. Frontbenchers have been privately urging the Labour leader to take more risks, shut down opponents’ attack lines quickly and focus relentlessly on the cost of living. “If this moment of courage ends up just being a one-off then we’ll be back to square one,” a senior shadow minister said. “His foot’s in the door now, so assuming that he doesn’t get an FPN [fixed penalty notice] then he has to keep going, double down on the strong leadership narrative, and keep convincing people that he has what it takes.” His defenders reject the caricature of him as a cautious lawyer and say he often edits his PMQs briefings to be more brutal. “Keir has got way more of a killer instinct than he is given credit for,” one senior aide said. The coming summer campaign is regarded by many as one of the most important periods for Labour to capitalise on its polling advantage and an opportunity for airtime to be used to emphasise some key new policies. New selections for both target and safe seats left by departing MPs will ramp up. In a 51-page report on the party’s future, Tony Blair urged Starmer to make a virtue of the selections, highlighting a high calibre of candidate backed by the leadership, though that is likely to reignite tensions with local parties wary of stitched-up selections. The former leader also urged Starmer to draw a line under “woke” issues within the party – another source of internal anguish. But the extensive polling in the report suggested a significant opportunity for Labour to recapture many new voters who voted Conservative by large margins in 2019 despite not being strong leave voters. Those were defined in two groups: aspirational working class voters who voted leave but by a slim margin; and professionals worried about issues such as tax and economic competence – the majority of whom voted remain. Both groups voted Conservative by large margins in 2019 but Blair said they represent Labour’s strongest opportunities to gain more votes. Blair also urged Starmer to be radical in laying out a political programme. The party has succeeded in putting across plans for a windfall tax – which look increasingly likely to be pinched by the Tories. But when it comes to the next manifesto, Labour-leaning policy wonks who have held discussions with Starmer’s advisers warn that they are still a very long way away from having the bold ideas they will need. The next few weeks are likely to bring another key advance, with a predicted victory in the Wakefield byelection. That timing is also likely to coincide closely with the verdict of Durham police, who have the Labour leader’s fate in their hands.",News/Politics,Now he’s got ‘a foot in the door’ can Keir Starmer keep going?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/13/now-hes-got-a-foot-in-the-door-can-keir-starmer-keep-going

5/13/2022,"When P&O sacked 800 of its workers with the intention of replacing them with agency staff, including foreign workers allegedly paid less than minimum wage, it sparked an outcry. As businesses become more global, shouldn’t workers’ rights, too? I asked Jason Hickel, economic anthropologist and visiting senior fellow at LSE, if it’s time for a global minimum wage. Am I right in thinking that when people discuss the global minimum wage, they’re not saying everyone on the planet should be paid the same?That’s correct. Some people propose setting it at 50% of each country’s median income. Others, and this is my preferred option, propose that it should be pegged to decent living standards in each country. So whatever is required to access good housing, healthcare, education, water, electricity, internet and so on. Right, because if you don’t peg it to living standards you get what we have in the UK: one in six working households in poverty. Could a global minimum wage lift the floor for Britons, too?Yes, it would eliminate working poverty in rich countries as well as poorer countries. It may also help reduce excess material consumption in the global north, because without extreme labour exploitation consumer goods would be closer to their true cost. Shifting purchasing power from rich to poor, while guaranteeing decent living standards – that’s a gain for workers and ecology. But hang on, if there were still differences country to country, the P&O situation could happen again.It’s conceivable. But under this arrangement, there would be much less variation in minimum wages. Most ordinary people would agree that people should be paid enough to live with dignity, right? And yet that isn’t the reality for the majority of people on this planet – and it’s happening in wealthy countries such as the UK and US, too. So I’d expect the popularity of this measure to be quite strong. How would this be enforced?It could be an agreement managed by an international institution – for example, the International Labour Organisation in Geneva. Hmm, after Brexit, an organisation in Switzerland calling the shots might not play well in the UK.The point should always be democratic consensus rather than strong-arming. As far as the ILO goes, the main problem is it represents not only the interest of labour but also the interest of states and businesses, so it’s a tripartite. To me, this is a weakness of the institution as a defender of workers’ rights. I’d like to see workers having a stronger voice. But it could be managed simply by international agreements, similar to those we have around emissions or the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I’ve spoken to people in the ILO who said they have the capacity to manage such a system. It depends on nations’ political will. Has it been taken up by a political party?Not yet. It’s only been floating around as an idea for about the past 10 years. Ooh, I love a big idea! Isn’t that why so many people are upset with politicians – no big ideas! Hey Jason, maybe this could be it…Well, I would agree with that.

5/13/2022,"Leinster have been heralded as the best team in Europe by the Toulouse head coach, Ugo Mola, before Saturday’s European Champions Cup semi-final clash in Dublin. Toulouse, the defending champions, return to the Aviva Stadium, having last week edged past Munster in a place-kicking shootout following their 24-24 draw at the same venue. The match is a repeat of the 2019 semi-final, also played at the Aviva Stadium, with Leinster running out 30-12 winners. Toulouse have won the tournament five times but Leinster are the favourites to add to their four titles, having ruthlessly dispatched Leicester in the previous round. Leinster are unchanged from that match while Mola has tweaked his side with Cyril Baille and Anthony Jelonch coming into the pack and Juan Cruz Mallía selected on the right wing. “We play a team that totally masters the European games,” said Mola. “Three years ago, they took us out [in] the semi-finals. We learned a lot that day, and three years later we are no longer the same [team]. But neither [are] they. “Leinster remains in my eyes a reference of European rugby, with this ability to provoke things, to have a structured, inspired and inspiring rugby. I remain convinced that they are the best team in Europe, for a very long time, in their rugby.

5/13/2022,"Nearly 60 years after her death, the entertainment industry’s attempts to resurrect Marilyn Monroe continue apace. Earlier this week, Andy Warhol’s 1964 silk-screen portrait of the actor was sold at auction for $195m – the highest sum ever paid for a work of 20th-century art. The previous week, Kim Kardashian turned up to the Met Gala in New York in the $4.8m crystal-covered nude silk gown Monroe wore to serenade John F Kennedy at his 45th birthday party. It was deemed a less-than-successful tribute. While Warhol’s immortalisation of the actor in blue-and-pink pop art helped seal her image for the next half century, a reality TV star donning a dead woman’s frock in quasi-emulation went down less well. Details of the extreme diet Kardashian undertook to squeeze into the gown sat ill at ease with Monroe’s mystique. The revelation that she required a white stole because she couldn’t manage the zipper further undid the effect. On Thursday, the International Council of Museums weighed in, sternly noting that “historic garments should not be worn by anybody, public or private figures.” While the dress was the property of a private collector – Ripley’s Believe it or Not! – its heritage, they continued, “must be understood as belonging to humanity” and the artefact “kept preserved for future generations”. That an outfit worn by an actor to sing Happy Birthday should be afforded the reverence of the magna carta is testiment to the seriousness, as well as the fever, with which Monroe is still held in the cultural imagination. It’s not just Hollywood that claims her as a person of key historical importance. A decade ago, a black-and-white shot of Monroe was chosen as the poster for the 2012 Cannes film festival, which described her as “an eternal icon whose grace, mystery and power of seduction remain resolutely contemporary … the Festival is a temple of glamour and Marilyn is its perfect incarnation.” This year’s Cannes begins on Tuesday, and many people had anticipated Monroe would again be the de facto star. Festival director Thierry Frémaux had ”loved” Blonde, a new biopic of the star, and wanted it to play on the Croisette. Its director, Andrew Dominik, was thrilled to accept. Yet Netflix, the company behind the film, were not so enamoured. Longstanding wranglings between the festival and the streaming giant have meant Frémaux’s team now impose strict conditions on films that play in competition: they must open in French cinemas and not be seen online for a further 18 months. Netflix baulked and offered an eight-month theatres-only compromise, which Frémaux reportedly rejected. An out-of-competition spot was not sufficiently tempting for Netflix, whose awards ambitions are yet to be wholly sated by the successes of films such as Roma, Marriage Story and The Power of the Dog. It now seems likely Blonde will premiere instead at the Venice film festival in late August – where comparable titles such as Pablo Larraín’s Princess Diana biopic Spencer and Jackie, his take on JFK’s widow, first screened. Yet advance word on the film suggests that it may be cut from rather less rarefied cloth. While Larraín’s films were experimental in style and unflinching in their depiction of the women’s inner struggles, they remained essentially reverential. Dominik’s film is reportedly brutal – and revolutionary. “There’s something in it to offend everyone,” the director said this week in response to the decision of the US ratings board to award it an NC-17 certification – which dramatically limits its commercial prospects. Dominik, whose previous work includes Australian crime film Chopper and a Jesse James western starring Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck, remained bullish in his defence of his film. “It’s a demanding movie,” he said. “If the audience doesn’t like it, that’s the fucking audience’s problem. It’s not running for public office. “I want to go and see the NC-17 version of the Marilyn Monroe story.” Though rumours of a scene featuring bloody menstrual cunnilingus are still to be confirmed, a rape is included. Joyce Carol Oates, on whose 2010 book it is based, praised a rough cut of the film, calling it “startling, brilliant, very disturbing and perhaps most surprisingly an utterly ‘feminist’ interpretation … not sure that any male director has ever achieved anything [like] this.” The film, which follows Monroe from her troubled childhood through to her death from a barbiturates overdose aged 36, has been a passion project for Dominik since the publication of Oates’ book 12 years ago. Knives Out actor Ana de Armas stars in the title role – taking over from Jessica Chastain, who took over from Naomi Watts. Dominik has credited the #MeToo movement with enabling him to make a film sufficiently “critical of American sacred cows”. Before then, he said, “nobody was interested in that sort of shit – what it’s like to be an unloved girl, or what it’s like to go through the Hollywood meat-grinder”. Other early viewers of the film have also been impressed. Jamie Lee Curtis, who co-starred with de Armas in Knives Out and whose father, Tony Curtis, features as a character in the film, said: “I dropped to the floor. I couldn’t believe it. Ana was completely gone. She was Marilyn.” The version of Monroe with which Blonde confronts audiences is likely to be challenging as well as familiar. How great an appetite there is for a radically demythologised take on this most totemic of sex symbols remains to be seen.",Arts/Film,Blonde: will a shocking new film shatter the myth of Marilyn Monroe?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/13/marilyn-monroe-abiding-obsession-biopic-blonde
5/13/2022,"In 2010, I competed in the Eurovision song contest as Alyosha, representing Ukraine. My song, Sweet People, was about war, ego and finding the political will to save our planet. It feels more relevant now than ever. Since the conflict broke out, I see the world differently and Eurovision has taken on new meaning. It’s not just a night of frivolity any more, and fans aren’t just music fans – their support means so much more this year. I’ve been living in New Jersey with my three children and mother-in-law since we fled Kyiv in March. In the blur of the evacuation, I forget exactly when we arrived but my life here is a world away from what my husband, parents, brothers and their families are still experiencing in Ukraine. They are doing everything they can to fight for freedom back home, and I’m doing my best to play my part here: attending charity events and trying to raise money and awareness any way I can, while I take care of my kids. Being a busy working mother continues even in these abnormal circumstances. Eurovision this year is just another way to spread the message that freedom for Ukraine is freedom for all of us. As a singer, I’ve always found that music speaks to people’s hearts and souls in a way that politicians can’t. To see this year’s act, Kalush Orchestra, on the world stage flying the flag for Ukraine will be a very powerful moment. The group have said they “represent every Ukrainian”, which comforts me. They will stand for all of us when the lights go up. Their song, Stefania, has become an anthem back home. The track was originally written about frontman Oleh Psiuk’s mother, but it has since taken on new meaning for many. The group have been granted special permission to travel to Turin for the contest, but will return to Ukraine after competing “to provide [their] contribution”. That’s typical of the Ukrainian resolve and fighting spirit in the face of huge adversity. I hope viewers will see that. War might begin in specific countries, but this war affects the whole world. Three months into the conflict, Europe has got complacent. Bombs and destruction have become the new normal. But what Ukrainians are facing is not normal. I can’t even fathom the atrocities I’m hearing about. Children as young as mine are losing their lives – and for what? What is happening is evil. It goes against everything it means to be human. I hate Russian soldiers for that, but their lives are sacred too. I don’t want to see human lives sacrificed for a war they don’t understand. In that way, I think it was right for Eurovision to ban Russia from participating this year. Putin’s war is not compatible with the values of a contest that champions international cooperation and inclusion. Russia must continue to be excluded from international events until it backs down. So as Kalush Orchestra take the stage, I hope the world will hear our rallying cry. We need Europe to be with us in more than just words – thoughts and prayers can get us only so far. If people truly want to help, they need to dig into their pockets, inform themselves, and mobilise. We desperately need money for weapons and medicines, but also for nappies and clothes. We can’t win this fight alone. Eurovision has always been a political contest, so in that sense winning isn’t really important. It’s the reach this night gives us that is more valuable. It’s also a vital way of facilitating meetings between allies, and making friends. Most artists sing in English so we can all understand their messages. I hope to hear other countries pledging their support publicly. War is bad for our souls. Every day I wonder if today might be the day I get to go home – I miss Ukraine. My bags are packed by the door and I’m ready to go. If I didn’t have children, I would have stayed. I love my country, my culture and my history, and I feel a strong pull to be there. Eurovision at least will be a moment of pride, of normality and good music – a night to know Ukraine isn’t forgotten in the hearts of many. Support may be just tiny drops in the sea, but lots of little drops make an ocean.

5/13/2022,"A group of MPs has accused the government of lacking the “will or care” to create a fairer and more equal society, after it rejected calls to force companies to reveal the pay gap between white employees and others. On Friday the government stated its intention to instead accept the recommendation of its controversial report on racial disparity, which was widely condemned by MPs, unions and equality campaigners as “divisive” and a missed opportunity for systematic change when it was published in March 2021. In February, the cross-party women and equalities committee called for legislation to introduce mandatory reporting for companies with more than 250 employees, a requirement that has existed for the gender pay gap since 2017. It argued that mandatory reporting would help address pay disparities between employees from different ethnic backgrounds. The government has backtracked on the issue of ethnicity reporting. In 2018 the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy launched a consultation that stated: “The government believes it is time to move to mandatory ethnicity pay reporting.” The consultation closed in January 2019, but the government is yet to publish a response. The minister Paul Scully promised in January that the government would respond “in due course” – a commitment reiterated on Friday. The government said it would not make companies report their ethnicity pay gap, arguing the move would have “significant statistical and data issues” – instead saying it would give guidance to employers reporting their ethnicity pay gaps voluntarily. The guidance includes advice on reporting the distinction between different ethnic groups and advice for employers in regions with statistically low numbers of people from ethnic minorities. Caroline Nokes, the Conservative chair of the women and equalities committee, said systems and structures were already in place for mandatory reporting, and added that the government had already stated it would address the stated difficulties around reporting in its guidance. “Introducing mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting for larger businesses would set the ball rolling, reducing inequalities between different ethnic groups,” she said. “The government’s nonsensical response – which claims that gathering the necessary data would be too difficult, and then promptly outlines how this could easily be addressed – is disappointing. It makes clear that what is lacking in this administration is not resource or knowhow, but the will or care to foster a fairer and more equal society.” In its response to the MPs, the government said it was accepting the recommendation made by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities that ethnicity pay gaps should continue to be reported on a voluntary basis. Its response stated that the government did not want to “impose new reporting burdens on businesses”, adding: “Ethnicity pay gap reporting is just one type of tool to assist employers in creating a fairer workplace. It may not be the most appropriate tool for every type of employer seeking to ensure fairness in the workplace.”",News/World news,MPs attack ministers’ ‘nonsensical’ refusal to make firms reveal race pay gap,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/13/mps-attack-ministers-nonsensical-refusal-to-make-firms-reveal-race-pay-gap
5/13/2022,"The glimpse of a possible Picasso in the home of Imelda Marcos seen during a visit by her son, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, after his election win has set off a flurry of speculation in the Philippines, where the family that once plundered billions is set to return to power. Marcos Jr, the son and namesake of the late dictator, won a landslide victory in Monday’s presidential election, an outcome that has appalled those who survived his father’s regime. Images released by the family showed Marcos Jr visiting the home of his mother, Imelda, who had displayed Picasso’s Femme Couche VI (Reclining Woman VI), or a replica, above the sofa. NEW: On September 30, 2014, the government seized a Picasso Reclining Women VI from the Marcoses' San Juan home. What's it doing there in Imelda Marcos' home in recent photos? Will thread, and show court documents. https://t.co/nN4ySIK6Iq It is unclear if the painting, one of eight targeted for seizure by anti-corruption authorities in 2014, is genuine, but the unexpected appearance of the nude in blues and greens reclining on an orange and yellow bed has added to fears the family will use its now-increased power to brazenly further stifle efforts to recover ill-gotten wealth. Marcos Sr presided over rife human rights abuses during his 20-year rule, including the arrest, torture and killings of his opponent, and used his power to plunder as much as $10bn until he was deposed in 1986. The family squirrelled away the funds in overseas bank accounts and real estate, while Imelda, the dynasty’s matriarch, splashed out on an infamous shoe collection, jewellery, artworks and designer clothes. The family and its backers have since rebranded the Marcos name, with disinformation about Marcos Sr’s rule spread widely online. Ruben Carranza, a former commissioner for the presidential commission on good government (PCGG), which was set up to investigate and recover ill-gotten wealth, said it was unclear if the painting was a genuine Picasso. “Mrs Marcos has had a habit of buying fake paintings, as well as lending fake paintings for display,” Carranza said. But he added: “The fact that she’s now displaying it just shows not just the duplicity of Mrs Marcos – but that she has to display the duplicity and the extravagance that she thinks she’s displaying for Filipinos to see … That says something even worse.” He added: “It shows this really, absolutely uncaring attitude for Filipinos. They’ve not only now been led to believe that [the Marcoses] have gold. Now, they’re leading them to believe, again, that they have so much wealth that they can just display it whenever they please,” said Carranza. For years, there has been speculation online that the Marcoses have huge sums of gold, which was given to Marcos Sr by a wealthy family as payment for acting as their lawyer. According to the story, the gold would be shared with the people if the family regained power. Marcos Jr has either downplayed or denied the abuses that occurred in the Phlippines under his father. As president, he would have the power to appoint the commissioners of the PCGG, granting him huge influence over the body that was set up to recover the family’s wealth. The PCGG has reportedly retrieved about $5bn, while a further $2.4bn was bogged down in litigation, and more remains missing, according to recent reports. The Picasso was supposed to have been seized by the government in 2014, but a former commissioner on good government, Andres Bautista, told the Rappler news site co-founded by the Nobel peace prize winner Maria Ressa that he believed the item was a fake. “Personally I know that what we seized was a fake. It was a tarpaulin so it’s still with them,” he told the site. The Marcos family continues to face dozens of court cases over their plundered wealth. Imelda is appealing against a 2018 criminal conviction on seven corruption charges. Marcos Jr’s spokesperson, Vic Rodriguez, did not respond when asked during a press conference to clarify whether the artwork on display in the Marcos home was genuine.",News/World news,‘Lost’ Picasso spotted in Imelda Marcos’s home after son’s election win,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/13/lost-picasso-spotted-in-imelda-marcos-home-after-son-bongbong-election-win
5/13/2022,"Antonio Conte can smile about it now but nobody was smiling then. Least of all him. The Tottenham manager is preparing for Sunday’s Premier League game at home to Burnley, when everything will be on the line for him and his players in terms of a Champions League finish. Spurs know that they have to win in order to maintain the pressure on fourth-placed Arsenal, who go to Newcastle on Monday night. But it is impossible to consider Burnley without remembering Turf Moor and what took place on that miserable night towards the end of February. Hard on the heels of the stunning 3-2 win at Manchester City, Conte and Spurs had travelled with optimism, the feeling pronounced that a corner had been turned. When it all came crashing down in a lacklustre 1-0 defeat, it was the prompt for Conte’s definitive Spurs meltdown. As he burned with anger, saying that he could not go on this way and questioning whether he would be able to improve the situation, he looked like a man who had passed the point of no return. It was possible to think that he was about to quit, although the Spurs hierarchy were confident he would calm down. They know that the wild mood swings are a part of him, even in victory, when he can go over the top in the other direction. What of the players, who had been savaged by implication? The January transfer window had closed, the summer was a long way away and Conte surely risked alienating some or all of those he would have to work with for the remainder of the season. Had he gone too far with the helplessness and resignation? There were several hard-to-answer questions. What was indisputable was that Conte had gathered his chips and shoved them all in. On one level, it was him leveraging his future involvement with the team, the suggestion there that the players would regret it if he left. On another, it was Conte showing how much it meant, how much it has to mean; the need to go through all manner of internal agonies to find the solutions. He will always do this, living and breathing the job. The players must do the same. Above all, though, it was a challenge to their professional pride. The results have been eye-catching – eight wins and two draws in the 12 league matches that have followed; the latest the 3-0 home thumping of Arsenal in Thursday’s high-stakes derby. To continue the poker analogy, it feels as though Conte has caught his card on the river. But really he has played the shrewdest of hands, taking control with a devastating mix of bluff and aggression. “I understand very well that I took a risk [after Burnley] because a lot of people didn’t understand,” Conte said. “I read that it only took two months for Tottenham to make Conte crazy! I remember very well that I was the crazy [one]. “Sometimes coaches have a strategy and it is the stick or the carrot. At the time, all the environment needed the stick. Myself, I was the first person and I hit myself. And then the others. Because before saying something wrong about the players or the situation, the first to take the blame has to be the manager. At the time, I thought it was right to go strong to try to change the situation. “No one thought then that with two games to go, Totttenham could fight for the Champions League. Instead, we are there now and from that step we improved a lot. There are moments when everyone has to take responsibility. The manager is the first, then the players, the club and all the employees of Tottenham. Because we win and we lose together.” Spurs closed to within one point of Arsenal with the derby win and, if the momentum is with them, they have to hope it has turned against Arsenal; that their rivals will slip up at Newcastle or at home to Everton on the final day. Spurs finish with a trip to Norwich. It was interesting to see the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, take a different approach after his team’s defeat at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. They had been well beaten but he insisted – publicly at least – that the responsibility did not lie with them, rather the referee, Paul Tierney, who awarded Spurs a 22nd-minute penalty for 1-0 and sent off Rob Holding shortly after. Arteta appeared determined to protect his players from self-doubt at any cost, even if it meant him looking petulant. Tierney’s decisions had been correct. For Conte, it has been a process of mutual understanding at Spurs and the signs have come to look positive. He has generated tremendous buy-in from the fans, who chorused his name towards the end of the derby and were delighted when he acknowledged it with applause. The players, meanwhile, have greater clarity. “It was important for me to know my players much better and them to know me much better and understand sometimes when I’m angry, why I’m angry,” Conte said. “The defeat against Burnley made me very angry. But now they are improving in many aspects – not only on the pitch but mentally they are becoming strong. “I go totally with my heart, mind and head. I’m a passionate person. To see me afterwards sometimes on TV, it’s not simple to see me in this way. I go totally into the club where I work and, in this way, I’m able to give everything and, also, to receive everything from my players, my club and the fans. If I’m the first person to give 200%, then for sure I can ask for this [in return].”",Sport/Football,Spurs reaping reward after Antonio Conte’s night of high-stakes poker | David Hytner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/13/spurs-reaping-reward-after-antonio-contes-night-of-high-stakes-poker
5/13/2022,"Wealthy people are “blowing the bloody doors off” on extravagant holidays costing as much as £100,000 to celebrate the easing of coronavirus travel restrictions with extended families. Sally Donaldson, a store manager of high-end travel agent Kuoni, said she was recently left trembling when a couple with two children spent more than £50,000 on a trip to the Caribbean island of Antigua. “It’s an awful lot of money. Astonishing really,” Donaldson said. “We’re delighted to help the customers, but when you see that sort of money spent on a holiday you do start to shake a little … It’s more than how many years salary for most people? It makes you wonder what these people do, but everyone works hard and we all deserve a holiday.” Donaldson, who manages Kuoni’s branch inside the John Lewis department store on London’s Oxford Street, said that after being forced to curtail their travel plans during Covid, customers had spare cash and were now ready to spend big. She and her colleagues have sold some other bespoke trips for more than £100,000. “People haven’t travelled for two years because of the pandemic, and are really keen to get going again and are not questioning the price,” she said. “I’d say more than 80% mention the pandemic as their reason for wanting to get away, spend time with family they hadn’t been able to over the lockdowns. “These aren’t your ordinary European breaks,” she said. “These are special trip-of-a-lifetime adventures.” The trend for booking very expensive holidays as the pandemic eases – dubbed “gratifications” by industry leaders – has been noted in research by the travel agency body ABTA. “After over two years of severely restricted travel people are desperate to head off overseas and many are booking the holiday of a lifetime,” Sean Tipton of ABTA said. “Many of these trips will be funded by savings made throughout the pandemic when opportunities to go out to restaurants, bars, cinema, the theatre and other leisure activities were massively curtailed and consequently many saw their savings increase.” It comes as most Britons face the biggest squeeze on their incomes since at least 1990, with the Bank of England warning that people face a ­triple whammy of inflation surging to 10%, energy bills hitting nearly £3,000 a year, and rising interest rates. Tom Barber, the founder of the London-based travel agency Original Travel, said many customers have “spent the lockdowns flipping through coffee table travel books and making lists of places they want to go to. Now they can finally put the lists into action. “After years of taking travel for granted and then losing our right to roam, guilt-free ‘gratifications’ are all about casting off the shackles of lockdowns and quarantines to embrace travel and all its pleasures once more,” he said. “No more waiting for ‘one day’ – now is the time to treat yourself and visit that place you’ve always wanted to visit, enjoy the experiences you’ve always wanted to try and generally take the holiday you’ve always wanted to take. “People are telling us that they are absolutely going to blow the bloody doors off [on the spending on holidays] this year.” Barber said the average spend per booking has increased to about £21,000 up from £14,000 in 2018-19. He said about 8% to 10% of all trips cost more than £50,000 compared with 2% before the pandemic. Going on holiday abroad is currently illegal.You risk the lives of your family and friends.Stay at Home.Save Lives. As well as costing more, holidays are also increasing in length. Barber said a quarter of all trips booked through his agency are now for 15 days or more, compared with about a tenth of trips before the pandemic. “Many people are going on months-long sabbaticals,” he said. “They’re realising that taking the kids out of school for one academic term isn’t that bad a thing as long as they do something educational. “Two years ago the government told us all that going on holiday was illegal, now people are never going to take travel for granted again.” Barber said popular “bucket list” trips customers had booked recently included a seven-week diving holiday to Indonesia and the Pacific island of Palau, a five -week family sabbatical road trip across the US, and a tour of Michelin-starred restaurants in Spain. Other top destinations have included viewing the northern lights in Norway, the mountain gorillas in Rwanda and Uganda, and voyages to Antartica. “We have all been dreaming, planning and anticipating 2022’s holidays for nearly two years, so it’s no surprise that the types of holidays we’re booking now are more ‘decadent’ in one way or other, with people wanting to treat themselves after such a long period of abstinence. “Decadence means different things to different people; for some, it’s about luxury, for others it’s about hedonism, richness of experiences or being completely off the grid.” Barber said three-generation trips – which he dubs 3G – are also proving popular as families make the most of time together. “Now we really know how important family is, and if the grandparents have made it through the pandemic being together is all the more important.” Barber said finding a location that works for all three generations can be difficult, and trips need to take place in the school holidays so it can be very expensive. “Often it will be large private hire properties, like a safari lodge in Kenya or a beachside villa,” he said. “More often than not its the grandparents who are paying – dangling the trip as way to get everyone together.”",News/Business,Well-off Britons splash out on trips of a lifetime as Covid restrictions ease,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/13/well-off-britons-splash-out-on-trips-of-a-lifetime-as-covid-restrictions-ease
