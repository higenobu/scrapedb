4/23/2022,"An era comes to be defined by its major innovations and, sometimes, just a simple company name does the trick: the Ford Motor Company more than a century ago, or Virgin in the 1980s. They are the business ideas that sum up a moment of progress. Of course, somewhat less prophetically, there were also the shorter-lived promise offered by DeLorean or Myspace. Until last week, all of us were enjoying “the Netflix boom”, mainly because of what the streaming giant represented, rather than for what it actually was. Netflix stood for easy access to culture, for family sharing, and for turning our backs on the shallow commerce of ad breaks. And it quickly became rather an emotional consumer relationship, especially during the dark lockdowns imposed during the pandemic. In isolation, the homebound took solace in The Crown, Stranger Things, Bridgerton, Money Heist, Lupin, Call My Agent! or Squid Game. In fact for 10 years now in the UK, these box-set shows have fed a national conversation that occasionally also intersected with the chatter around the rest of the world. So when Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings admitted last week that 200,000 subscribers had walked away in the first quarter of the year, with more likely to follow, fans of the service were forced to reassess. As a result of the losses, the company’s share price dropped more than 35% last Wednesday, sliding nearly 8% further the next day. Then billionaire investor Bill Ackman decided to sell his Netflix shares, despite incurring a vast loss, because things were suddenly looking so scary. For many inside the industry, the alarm call from Netflix was the sign they had been waiting for that, after a vertiginous climb, “peak subscription” had finally been reached. After all, hadn’t music lovers already noticed how complicated their love affair with Spotify had become? The freedom to enjoy their favourite tunes was, it turned out, actually a threat to the livelihoods of the musicians that made them. Among those who claim to have seen the writing on the wall well before the Netflix announcement are two Swedish entrepreneurs who are banking on a return to a simpler deal. Måns Ulvestam and Karl Rosander, the founders of Acast, the podcast platform, have now created a new ebook and audiobook platform – for which customers will only pay what they want, when they want it, on any device. Called Sesamy, the Swedes believe the public has seen through the premise of a subscription. In their view, it is not just belt-tightening that has caused Netflix members to leave the fold. “We are seeing the end of the something now that began with the paywall,” said Ulvestam. “It is not sustainable because it does not work for customers or for creatives any more.” Like the gyms that rely on users forgetting about their monthly membership payments, the subscription model, according to Sesamy’s creators, verge on being a deception. “We think all these content subscriptions, with their ‘easy on-boarding’ and very tricky cancellation, are almost a fraud,” said Rosander. But surely Netflix, a place where so many British viewers still go to enjoy their evenings, cannot be facing disaster? After all, even a show with bad reviews such as Anatomy of a Scandal is drawing a lot of viewers, while this weekend the new teen drama Heartstopper has been greeted with critical bouquets and hailed by some as the most important British TV show since It’s a Sin. Much of the rush to weep over Netflix’s imaginary open grave has been partly motivated by the way the success of the company, which had attracted new subscribers steadily for more than a decade, has been held up as an example to public service broadcasters such as Channel 4 and the BBC. When the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, said earlier this month that she wanted Channel 4 to be free to compete with Netflix, many programme-makers were quick to point out that the global streamer she so admired had had great difficulty establishing a viable business model. And Netflix itself has never liked this rivalry. The company line is that Britain’s public service channels are its “creative partners”. To substantiate this, it points to investment in hundreds of hours of content, including popular shows such as The Serpent, Giri/Haji, and Dracula. A show such as The End of the F**king World, first seen exclusively on Channel 4 and then shown by Netflix, reaped renewed popularity when it returned to C4 for a second series. For those other Netflix sceptics, the cinephiles, news of the drop in subscriptions bore the sweet scent of revenge. Film fans are still smarting at the way the streamer challenged the financial balance of cinema’s theatrical distribution model. Once Netflix started to make its own feature-length products, the Cannes film festival tried to take a stand against it by banning films that had not been given a release in French cinemas. Organisers warned of an existential threat to the big-screen experience. But now Netflix has become a prominent part of the film ecology, with The Irishman seducing director Martin Scorsese into the streaming world and both The Power of the Dog and Don’t Look Up winning Oscar nominations last month. Like many a good film hero, Netflix had more humble origins. Long before it dominated the entertainment scene, it was an unassuming DVD delivery service, just as Virgin started out as a record label and Amazon once only wanted to sell books. But in 2012, the same year Netflix launched in Britain, it began to produce its own content, among them the compelling Washington political drama House of Cards. Ten years on, the company has 221.64 million subscribers in more than 190 countries. Any documentary about Netflix’s fortunes, however, could not yet chart a dramatic downward path. For a start, a chunk of its financial instability can be put down to the shutting down of its Russian service following the invasion of Ukraine, and to the fact that most of those in the west who want to join Netflix already have. British Netflix subscription levels are holding up comparatively well, yet every form of media service is having to think quickly about what subscription overload will mean. And this pondering has become more urgent with the news that the Competition and Markets Authority in Britain is now set to make “subscription traps” illegal. So perhaps this is all a category error? That’s what some analysts argue, anyway. We have wrongly assumed that Netflix is a tech innovator simply because its extraordinary expansion prompted many media empires to copy it, including Disney, Warner Brothers, NBC and Paramount, to say nothing of Amazon and Apple. But Netflix is not really founded on tech: it is just an entertainment provider that became a production studio – and that is always a very precarious business. As the screenwriter William Goldman famously put it, in showbiz “nobody knows anything”. It simply is not possible for hit to follow hit, even if you spend $55bn on television shows and movies, as Netflix did between 2018 and 2021. In reaction to the subscriptions slump, Hastings and his team have suggested they will be holding back on their spending, opening their minds to running adverts “in a year or two”, and pushing harder on quality by somehow “taking it up a notch”. (These three key strategies, of course, are also shared by many of the old-style content providers.) One Twitter wit, Jake Menez (@Jake Menez), met the news that Netflix was now considering launching a cheaper service supported by adverts with the line: “That’s pretty neat. I’d probably give it a snappy name like ‘television’ or maybe ‘cable.’” For the average household, the company’s change in attitude to the cosy sharing of passwords will come as a bigger shock. Six years ago Hastings said “we love people sharing Netflix”. Now, with an estimated 100 million people using each other’s accounts, the chief executive is not so relaxed. The truth is that neither consumer markets nor quality entertainment are endlessly expandable. If we all want a supply of good films and television, we have to ensure that it is priced fairly and that the artists are being paid well. Otherwise, as Rosander drily points out, TV culture is in danger of reverting to a Renaissance situation, where only the wealthy can afford the good stuff: “That is why all the paintings back then were of the duke’s wife.”",News/Media,House of cards?

4/23/2022,"Jacob Rees-Mogg has been called “condescending” after leaving notes deemed to be passive-aggressive on civil servants’ desks in an effort to stop them working from home. As part of his campaign to push workers back into offices, the cabinet minister has toured Whitehall buildings and published a league table of government departments based on how many staff are present. It has now emerged he also distributed printed cards, which have been left on empty desks in the Cabinet Office department where he is based. The notes, complete with an official government crest, said: “Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon. With every good wish, Rt Hon Jacob Rees-Mogg MP.” The Conservative MP is the minister of state for Brexit opportunities and government efficiency, a new role created for him. The job gives him a seat at the cabinet table and puts him in charge of civil service reform but leaves him without a department to lead. Last week Rees-Mogg wrote to fellow cabinet ministers demanding they issue a “clear message to civil servants in your department to ensure a rapid return to the office”. Pro-government newspapers such as the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph have also been pushing staff to return to their workplaces following two years when many office workers stayed at home owing to the pandemic. Although Rees-Mogg’s messages were distributed to civil servants last week, they only became public after a photograph of one note was posted on Twitter by podcast producer Dino Sofos. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union, which represents civil servants, said the notes were “the most crass, condescending act I’ve seen from a minister”. He has said there was no rationale for Rees-Mogg’s fixation on forcing people to start commuting again: “Ministers’ obsession with ending flexible working and micromanaging the civil service increasingly just looks vindictive.” Penman said the government was “sounding like luddites, while the rest of the economy is embracing hybrid working”. Many civil service staff already share desks while flexible working had been relatively common before the pandemic. Rees-Mogg has argued that pushing civil servants back into the office would help realise the “benefits of face-to-face, collaborative working and the wider benefits for the economy”. There is some evidence that working from home has caused problems for the functioning of government during the pandemic. Raphael Marshall, the whistleblower who laid bare the government’s mishandling of last August’s Afghan crisis, said in evidence to parliament that staff shortages at the Foreign Office “were exacerbated by some staff working from home, which hampered communication”.",News/Politics,‘Condescending’: Jacob Rees-Mogg leaves notes for WFH civil servants,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/23/condescending-jacob-rees-mogg-leaves-notes-for-wfh-civil-servants
4/23/2022,"Sometimes cinema is at its most potent and engrossing when it’s stripped down to the essentials. Playground, the accomplished, uncomfortably powerful first feature from the Belgian writer-director Laura Wandel, is a lean 72 minutes in length, with no score and a lithe, instinctive, handheld camera that rarely leaves the face of seven-year-old Nora (Maya Vanderbeque, superb). It is piercingly insightful without ever labouring the point. The film Nora’s well-meaning attempt to intervene when she sees her older brother Abel (Günter Duret) targeted, exploring the way that bullying spreads like a stain through a primary and middle school community; how the taint of victimhood can override the bonds of friendship and family; and how doing the right thing can backfire catastrophically. Playground’s French title, Un monde, translates as “a world”, and the school is just that: the squat, blocky buildings and treacherous strip of asphalt are a hostile and inescapable environment. There is no respite – either for the audience or for the kids who find themselves outcasts in the semi-feral pack dynamic of childhood. Frédéric Noirhomme’s camera is virtually a character in the story. It hovers at children’s eye level, nervy in an unforgiving bluish, bruised colour palette, only occasionally allowing an adult to slip fully into focus. A sympathetic teacher (Laura Verlinden) is one; Nora and Abel’s father and, we assume, main carer (Karim Leklou) is another. But equally impressive is the sound: with the camera locked on Nora’s tearful saucer eyes, much of the tension is created, vividly, outside the frame. It’s a remarkable achievement.",Arts/Film,Playground review – a remarkable child’s-eye view of bullying ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/23/playground-review-bullying-laura-wandel
4/23/2022,"Lynette Linton was born in east London in 1990 and started writing and directing for the stage after joining the National Youth Theatre in her early 20s. Her three produced plays include Step and Hashtag Lightie and she won rave reviews for directing Lynn Nottage’s Sweat at the Donmar in 2018. The following year, aged just 28, she became the artistic director of the Bush theatre in west London. Linton’s production of House of Ife, the first show in the Bush’s 50th birthday season, opens on 29 April. She has also directed an adaptation of Kit de Waal’s novel My Name Is Leon, airing on BBC One later this year. In September, she will make her National Theatre directing debut with Pearl Cleage’s Blues for an Alabama Sky. Untidy Soul by Samm Henshaw I’m a bit obsessed with this album by the London artist Samm Henshaw. I saw him at the Shepherd’s Bush Apollo recently and he was just brilliant on stage. He sings beautiful R&B love songs, mixing together old-school and new-school. They’re the songs that I play to get me up in the morning. He’s really big in the US, but he should be much bigger over here, so I’m shouting him out. If you’re into Frank Ocean, you’d be into Samm Henshaw. I can’t stop listening to him. Bridgerton (Netflix) I binge-watched Bridgerton recently and it was really lovely. It’s such a great form of escapism. It’s set in Regency-era London, when there were so many rules in the society to do with courting, and that’s what makes it so romantic and sexy, because people can’t get together so easily. It’s great to see hard-working actors such as Jonathan Bailey and Adjoa Andoh getting proper recognition and it’s nice to be able to just sit and watch a love story unfold. Honey & Spice by Bolu BabalolaI really enjoy Babalola’s writing. She’s an incredible writer of fiction, with a real Twitter presence. She writes stories about love, particularly black love. Her debut collection, Love in Colour, adapted different myths from around the world. Now she’s publishing her first novel, Honey & Spice [5 July] and they’re describing it as “the romcom of the decade”. I’ve got a bit of an obsession about love at the minute so I’m really excited to delve into this. We need more love in our lives. Toyin’s Kitchen, Shepherd’s Bush, London W12 This is a brilliant Nigerian food stall in Shepherd’s Bush market, which is right next to the Bush theatre. Everybody who works at the Bush is always going there for lunch – I go at least twice a week. The owner, Toyin, is incredible. She does stews and curries and you get jollof rice and plantain and salad in massive portions. For me, it’s all about the coconut prawn curry. It’s very, very good. If you’re ever in Shepherd’s Bush, you should go. Dead Ass with Khadeen and Devale Ellis Khadeen and Devale Ellis are an African American married couple based in Brooklyn. They became Instagram-famous and now they do a podcast with relationship advice and what it’s like being parents in their mid-30s. I followed them for a long time before they blew up and now they’ve got four young boys. They’re really cool and down to earth. I like turning them on sometimes and listening to them banter with each other. They talk about how to raise a family, but also how to keep intimacy in a relationship when you’ve been together for so long. #couplegoals is probably the best way to describe this. Does the Shoe Fit? I’m really enjoying a lot of what YouTubers Chunkz and Yung Filly are doing at the minute. They have a channel with [shoe shop chain] Footasylum, which includes a dating show called Does the Shoe Fit?, among other stuff. The dating show is young and fresh and really funny. In each episode, they’re joined by guests such as the rapper Konan and Jack Fowler from Love Island and each of them goes on a speed date with the same woman, while the other three watch and comment. It’s unbelievably hilarious. BOYS at the Barbican This is a show exploring masculinity through movement. I’m a theatre director, but text is my anchor. What they’ve managed to do with BOYS is kind of the opposite: using physicality and movement to show fragility and vulnerability in men, specifically men of colour. It’s such a beautiful show.",Arts/Culture,On my radar: Lynette Linton’s cultural highlights,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/23/on-my-radar-lynette-linton-cultural-highlights
4/23/2022,"The memorial service for the Observer’s beloved columnist Katharine Whitehorn, organised by her sons Bernard and Jake, and held at St James’s church, Piccadilly in London last Monday, was completely marvellous and I feel certain that she would have loved every moment of it (Katharine died in January 2021, at the age of 92). Not only was the Revd Dr Mariam Ifode-Blease’s sermon reflexively feminist; her leopard-print spectacles spoke joyfully to Katharine’s first job at the paper (she joined the Observer in 1960) when, as its new fashion editor, she decided that it was her solemn duty to get the British woman out of her “limp cardigans” once and for all. When Bernard asked me to speak at the service, I responded by bursting into tears – I owe her such a lot, not least because from the moment I first read her as a little girl, I never wanted to be anything other than a journalist – and on the day, I was as nervous as hell. But in the end, of course, she did all the work for me. Quote Katharine once and everyone will laugh; quote her half-a-dozen times and you can spend the rest of the afternoon basking in her reflected glory. The biggest hoots came when I recalled how she put hats into three categories: offensive, defensive and shrapnel. The latter, in case you’re wondering, are the kind of “frilly bits” that might have landed almost by accident on the heads of random wedding guests. Last Thursday, my long-standing fascination with far-off St Kilda took me to a London theatre I’ve never visited before – the tiny Finborough, in Earl’s Court – to see a revival of Sue Glover’s 1988 play, The Straw Chair. It was a good production: Rori Hawthorn, who plays Isabel, a naive young woman newly married to an Edinburgh missionary, is destined to be a star. But I’m afraid that my deepest interest lay throughout in what this piece, based on the true story of Lady Grange, exiled to the islands by a cruel husband, inadvertently reveals about life there in the middle of the 18th century. Can it be true that, just as there are no trees on St Kilda, there were then also no chairs? Was it really the case that even the islanders’ breakfast porridge was taken with the fishy-tasting flesh of the seabirds (gannets, fulmars, puffins) on which they largely subsisted? A discussion of rotten eggs – early on, an islander insists that the more addled an egg, the better it tastes – distracted me so much that for a time I lost track of the plot entirely. At Easter, a miracle. Thanks to the kindest friends a person could ever have, I spent the weekend on a Caribbean beach, where I indulged once again a now well-established holiday tradition. It goes like this: the hotter and happier it is wherever I am, the more damp and miserable it must be in the novel I’m reading. On this score, Elizabeth Taylor’s The Sleeping Beauty exceeded all expectations by being set almost entirely in a postwar boarding house in an out-of-season south coast resort called – wait for it – Seething. Everyone in it is sad and thwarted, sleeps alone in their chilly bedroom and considers an hour in a milk bar whose windows are weeping condensation as no more than they are due by way of enjoyment – and yes, each page increased exponentially my own pleasure every time I lifted my eyes to the wide, turquoise sea.

4/23/2022,"The game was in the balance, Manchester United pushing hard and threatening an equaliser for 2-2, Arsenal on their heels. Then, in an isolated raid forward by the home team, Granit Xhaka brought his left foot down like a sledgehammer and everything changed. Bruno Fernandes had just missed a penalty for United. Now he was caught in possession on the edge of his own area by Mohamed Elneny, and when the ball was worked to Xhaka 25 yards out he had only one thing on his mind. The connection was impossibly sweet and the shot screamed past David de Gea. It had been a pretty fraught afternoon for Arsenal, with Mikel Arteta’s team riding their luck. But now United were broken and it would be Arsenal’s top four hopes that were boosted. United, by contrast, are surely out of the race. After all of the criticism in the wake of the 4-0 humbling at Liverpool last Tuesday, after all of the home truths from the interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, including the one about the squad needing open heart surgery, this was an improved United performance, at least at one end of the pitch. United created a huge number of openings with Diogo Dalot, the right-back, twice hitting the woodwork. The returning Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored their goal, had another one narrowly ruled out for offside. Their frustration was total, encapsulated by Fernandes: he was fortunate to escape with only a yellow card on 77 minutes after he left his studs in on Nuno Tavares, who opened the scoring early on with his first Arsenal goal. Arsenal had been the firm favourites to seal their first Champions League qualification since 2016 but it felt as if their young team had been gripped by nerves. And yet Xhaka would bend the narrative to the force of his will. The celebrations at full time reflected the scale of the result. For United, the misery goes on. Rangnick had been forced into a defensive change after the bomb threat to Harry Maguire’s house, which is not a sentence that anybody could have imagined reading but is somehow reflective of the fury and chaos around United. In came the fit-again Raphaël Varane in a back four and he was promptly at fault for the breakthrough goal. He was not the only one. Xhaka was given the space to waft over a cross from the left and first Varane and then Alex Telles missed their attempted clearances in slapstick fashion. The excellent Bukayo Saka shaped a shot for the far corner which was tipped out by De Gea at full stretch, but the United defence remained on their heels, particularly Dalot, and Tavares was able to tap home. Rangnick had welcomed back Ronaldo after the tragic death of his twin baby boy in childbirth and it was a lovely moment on seven minutes when the home crowd showed their support for him with a round of applause, as the Liverpool fans had also done at Anfield. United responded well to Tavares’s goal but defensively they remained an accident waiting to happen. Their last line was all over the place, and soon let Eddie Nketiah in for a one-on-one chance. For the umpteenth time De Gea saved his team but he would be beaten again moments later. What a strange goal it was, Saka nudging an Emile Smith Rowe flick through for Nketiah and being bodychecked by Victor Lindelöf in the process after the United centre-half was caught on the wrong side. Nketiah finished but VAR called him back for offside. The technology then got to work on the Lindelöf challenge. Penalty. Saka converted calmly. It would have been easy for United to feel sorry for themselves because they had created a host of opportunities to equalise for 1-1. Anthony Elanga, who had the pace to beat Tavares, twice ran through but he could not finish; Scott McTominay wasted a headed chance; Fernandes could not unload a chip after Aaron Ramsdale had surrendered possession; Ronaldo’s touch let him down on a high ball; and Dalot rattled the crossbar from 25 yards. The first half was wild. Arsenal were equally loose at the back, putting their fans through agonies as they tried and sometimes failed to play out from their own third. Ronaldo got in front of Gabriel too easily to convert a Nemanja Matic cross. There was still time for De Gea to save from Elneny and Martin Ødegaard, and Ramsdale to beat away a Telles blast. Paul Pogba, missing because of a calf injury and out of contract in the summer, tweeted during the interval that he hoped to return before the end of the season. “It’s not over, United we would stand,” he wrote, the conditional tense slightly weird. The same could be said of Tavares’s decision to jump for a United corner with his arm outstretched. Matic rose, the ball went into Tavares’s arm and it was an obvious penalty. Although he scored, the game had turned into an ordeal for Tavares on a personal level. He was reprieved when Fernandes stuttered, hopped and dragged his kick against the outside of a post. United continued to push. McTominay worked Ramsdale and, when Ronaldo spun and lashed home after a Fernandes headed flick, he was denied by the tightest of offside calls. Dalot then hit the post after a Ronaldo pass while Tavares was fortunate not to be penalised for a challenge on Elanga on the fringes of the area. The equaliser felt as though it was coming.

4/23/2022,"In many ways, the London borough of Wandsworth is a paradigm of the modern city. On one hand, it is a place where a teenager recently fainted from hunger in a food bank queue. And on the other, it is home to the “sky pool”, a spectacular transparent swimming pool suspended 10 storeys above ground in Nine Elms, and reserved exclusively for the development’s richest residents. The borough is also known for its comparatively low council tax – which, its Conservative-run council boasts, is the lowest average council tax in the country. Wandsworth also claims to be the only local authority in London that is cutting its share of council tax bills. “You look at the housing down here and wonder: ‘How much is for normal people?’ It looks like investment housing more than anything else,” said Yahan Lewis, 53, sitting on a park bench opposite Southside shopping centre after a visit to the jobcentre. “I always think it’s the money borough. It’s all about money. They keep the rates low and people vote for them.” Perhaps that is why, after more than four decades in charge of Wandsworth borough council, the Tories have proved immovable. Despite all three of its parliamentary constituencies being held by Labour – the Tories lost Battersea to Labour in 2017 and Putney two years later – and residents voting for Labour mayor Sadiq Khan, the council has remained firmly in the hands of the Tories. But amid anger over Partygate and as the cost of living crisis bites, this leading Tory council – one of a handful in London still under Conservative control – is on a knife edge. And on 5 May it could turn red for the first time since 1978 – potentially spelling disaster for the Tories and making it a key target for Labour. Robert Hayward, the Tory peer and pollster, said that Wandsworth was home to many of the kinds of traditional Tory voters that were now turning against Boris Johnson – namely, pro-remain women aged between 40 and 55. He also said the Conservatives were trying to make the campaign in the capital about their historic commitment to keep council tax down – and to blame Khan for increases. He says the race remains a close and unpredictable one. “It is Partygate versus low council tax,” he said. “That is essentially what the battle is. There were so many wards which were split or unbelievably close last time. The Labour party actually won more votes than the Tories [but gained them in the wrong places]. If the Conservatives just lose Wandsworth and they do well in other parts of the country, it will be a disappointment, but nothing more than that.” However, he went on: “If it is the top of a broader picture, it becomes emotionally very different.” The latest polling conducted in London suggests that Labour is doing slightly better than in 2018, the last time the same elections took place, but not by a large margin. The party did well that year, in the wake of Theresa May’s disastrous 2017 general election campaign. An Opinium poll for Sky News gave Labour a 20-point lead. Back in 2018, Labour secured a 15-point lead. One senior Tory, a veteran of London politics, said the changing demographics of Wandsworth would make it harder for the Conservatives. There was also increasing weariness over Partygate, he said, adding that more fines for the prime minister could make a difference as polling day approaches. Which is perhaps why Tories in seven London boroughs – including Wandsworth – will be listed as “local Conservatives” on the ballot paper rather than the “Conservative party candidate”, seemingly in an attempt to distance themselves from any toxicity of the national brand. But the Conservatives may struggle to pull in people they have previously counted on. On the newly pedestrianised Old York Road in the centre of the borough, where cyclists whiz past people dining outside delis, cafes and restaurants amid strategically placed planting, Liam Garrett, 30, said he did not know the local elections were coming up. The marketing business owner said he was fed up with all the talk of Partygate, which was “over the top”. He added: “It just needs to end as quickly as possible. There are far more pressing issues.” While he thinks Wandsworth council does a good job, particularly on council tax costs, he does not usually vote in local elections. Daisy Talbot, a 20-year-old Durham University student at home for the Easter holidays, voted Conservative previously, but this time around says she would not feel good about voting for them. “There’s definitely a shift,” she said, adding that, like her, many of her friends in the area would no longer vote Conservative. “Now, given lockdown especially and us being students, we feel like our age group hasn’t had much attention .” During the period when Johnson attended parties in lockdown, some of her friends were expelled from university for mixing. “I would feel guilty if I was complaining all the time and voted for them.” In contrast, she thought Keir Starmer was doing a good job: “He’s becoming a figure I’m much more aware of.” Life is hard for many Wandsworth residents: as people with mortgages start to join the queues for food banks, there is a lot more on people’s minds than parties. Charlotte White, 48, manager of Earlsfield food bank, said housing was a huge issue in the area and people were struggling with increasingly complex problems as a result of the cost-of-living crisis. “It’s not just our numbers that are going up, but the complexity of problems. People are coming in with complicated issues and the support simply isn’t there,” she said. “I think people wanting better solutions to those problems might have an effect on how they vote.”",News/Politics,Local elections: ‘It’s Partygate versus low council taxes’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/23/local-elections-its-partygate-versus-low-council-taxes-wandsworth
4/23/2022,"For many, the ferry ride between Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly marks the beginning of a relaxing weekend away. For residents of the islands wanting to visit their nearest bank, it’s about to become an expensive necessity. Lloyds, which ran the Isles’ last remaining branch, is about to close the site on the island of St Mary’s because of a persistent fall in customer numbers. It follows the closure of a branch of Barclays four years ago. A letter to Lloyds’ customers said that, from Monday, the nearest branch would be 44 miles away and accessible by the ferry to Penzance, Cornwall, the Times reported. That ferry takes two hours and 45 minutes each way, costs £139.20 for a return trip, and typically runs no more than once a day, meaning a visit to the bank will soon require an overnight stay. On Tuesday, the ferry will depart Scilly at 4.30pm and dock on the mainland at 7.30pm, by which time the nearest Lloyds branch will be closed. Customers will then have to be waiting at the doors when the bank reopens at 9am the following morning, because the return ferry sets off at 9.15am. The ferry runs only from March to November, meaning that in the winter months the only option will be a flight, with prices starting at £127 for a day return. Including the cost of accommodation, Scilly residents face having to fork out hundreds of pounds in order to visit their bank in person. There are about 2,300 permanent residents on the islands, rising to about 4,000 in summer. Lloyds said that last year the number of people using the islands’ last remaining branch at least once a month was just 33 and that 71% used online banking. Lloyds has said it will continue to maintain an ATM machine on St Mary’s and will trial sending a community banker to the island once every two weeks. There will still be a total of five Post Offices spread across the islands, where people can makes deposits and withdrawals. Steve Sims, the Isles’ councillor for the economy and tourism, told the Times: “I think people have got resigned to the idea.

Remember when there was a smidgen of hope that the collective trauma the world was facing would reshape people’s priorities and the pandemic could be a portal to a better, fairer society? Well, two years on, precisely none of that has happened. People clapped for essential workers for a bit but didn’t stop exploiting them. Meanwhile it’s boom time for billionaires, who saw their already obscene wealth grow exponentially during the pandemic. A new analysis released by Oxfam America on Monday, to mark tax day in the US, found US billionaires now own a combined $4.7tn in wealth. Much of this goes untaxed; last year ProPublica analyzed leaked tax returns and found the 25 richest people in the US paid a true tax rate of just 3.4% from 2014 to 2018. The average taxpayer, meanwhile, pays a true tax rate of 13%. It wasn’t always like this. As Oxfam notes, it really wasn’t that long ago that the ultra-wealthy paid their fair share in tax; during the second world war, the federal income tax rate peaked at 94% and was still 70% three decades later. The rich haven’t just gotten richer, they’ve also gotten a lot more selfish. While billionaires have seen their bank accounts balloon and corporations are raking in record profits, ordinary people are hurting from decades-high inflation. By some accounts, the inequality gap in the US is worse now than it was in France in the 1780s just before the French Revolution. It’s easy to get angry about all this, but you might want to wait a moment before jumping to the seemingly obvious conclusion that gross inequality is bad and we really ought to do something about it. You see, in a recent (embarrassingly fawning) interview with Chris Anderson, the head of Ted, Elon Musk helpfully billionaire-splained why it’s actually OK for a handful of people to hoard obscene amounts of wealth. “There are many people out there who can’t stand this world of billionaires,” Anderson said to Musk in the interview. “Like, they are hugely offended by the notion that an individual can have the same wealth as, say, a billion or more of the world’s poorest people.” Only an idiot would be offended by something like that, Musk essentially replied. “I think there’s some axiomatic flaws that are leading them to that conclusion,” he told Anderson. “For sure, it would be very problematic if I was consuming, you know, billions of dollars a year in personal consumption. But that is not the case. In fact, I don’t even own a home right now. I’m literally staying at friends’ places … I don’t have a yacht, I really don’t take vacations. It’s not as though my personal consumption is high.” Musk, who is worth almost $300bn, did concede that the one exception to his incredibly ascetic lifestyle is his $70m private jet, but said its use was justified because it gives him more hours to work. It’s essentially in the public good. So there you go. Put down your pitchforks everyone! Stop sharpening your guillotines! Anyone getting angry about inequality simply needs to examine their “axiomatic flaws”. It’s perfectly OK that the world’s billionaires have more wealth than 60% of the world’s population combined, as long as they buy private jets instead of yachts and couchsurf at their mate’s mansion instead of paying property tax on their own house. Really glad Musk cleared that up for us all. “Everyone is asking me [this], and that is a good question,” Talabi told Page Six. “But a great question would be asking our world leaders why the Earth is now losing 1.2tn tons of ice each year due to global warming and why climate crisis reform has been completely ineffective. I encourage you to contact your local representatives and ask them that.” An A+ answer. The Meta executive, who has built a brand around women’s empowerment, reportedly pressured the Daily Mail to drop unflattering stories about her ex-boyfriend Bobby Kotick, the Activision Blizzard CEO. Kotick, who Sandberg dated for three years until 2019, isn’t exactly the sort of dude you want to be associated with if you’ve made a name for yourself by championing women: he has been heavily criticized recently over allegations he was aware of “many incidents of sexual harassment, sexual assault and gender discrimination at Activision Blizzard”. Meanwhile, the stories Sandberg is alleged to have quashed reportedly revealed that Kotick’s former girlfriend filed a temporary restraining order against him because of bullying behaviour. (All parties involved deny doing anything inappropriate and say the allegations against Kotick are untrue.) Alfreda Scheuer leaned into her job so much that the CIA operative was dubbed “the Queen of Torture” by the New Yorker in 2014. Rolling Stone reports that Scheuer has now moved on to shilling skin serums on Instagram and is a life coach at company she runs called YBeU Beauty, where she helps women “look good, feel good, and do good”. A survey of 10,000 British women found makeup purchases and frequency of wearing cosmetics dropped by almost a third since 2020. The oil giant has updated company guidance on what flags can be displayed outside its offices, banning “external position flags” such as Pride and Black Lives Matter, according to Bloomberg. This is all in the name of maintaining “neutrality” apparently. Because neutrality is obviously just being white and straight. Some rare good news in the continued war against reproductive rights in the US. This piece is worth reading simply for the phrase “non-fungible tokenism”. This week I learned that there is a cafe in Tokyo called the Manuscript Writing Cafe which won’t let you in unless you’re a writer on a deadline and won’t let you leave unless you meet that deadline. The cafe also charges by the hour. A truly genius business idea.
