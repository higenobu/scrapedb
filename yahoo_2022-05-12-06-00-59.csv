5/12/2022,"The S&P 500 is down 16% so far in 2022. While investor sentiment is far from bullish these days, Goldman Sachs sees opportunity in one specific group of companies: those that return cash to investors on a regular basis. “We continue to recommend investors own stocks with high dividend yield and growth,” Goldman’s chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin writes in a note to clients. Kostin says strong corporate earnings growth means companies can hike their payouts going forward. And better yet, the market has not priced in that potential. “The futures market is expecting S&P 500 dividend growth to be negative in 2023 and 2024,” Kostin says. “Looking ahead, our forecast implies 6.7% CAGR dividend growth over the next ten years, significantly above market pricing of 0.4%.” Kostin’s team has identified several companies that fit this investment theme. Here’s a look at three of them. *Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Gilead Sciences is already one of the more generous dividend-payers from the healthcare sector, currently offering an annual dividend yield of 4.8%. But Goldman sees bigger payouts on the horizon. The financial juggernaut predicts that by 2023, Gilead’s dividend per share divided by its current price will lead to a yield of 5%. There’s good reason to be optimistic about this biopharmaceutical company. In Q1, Gilead’s revenue grew 3% year over year to $6.6 billion while adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to $2.12. It also has a solid cash position of almost $7 billion as of Mar. 31. Gilead started paying dividends in 2015 with a quarterly payout of 43 cents per share. Today, the company pays 73 cents per share — so the amount has grown by almost 70%. The past few years haven’t been kind to brick-and-mortar stores. So who would have guessed that electronics retailer Best Buy — with more than 1,000 stores in the U.S. and Canada — would be able to deliver the dividend growth that it has of late? In 2021, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 27% to 70 cents per share. Earlier this year, management announced another 26% quarterly payout increase to 88 cents per share. While many retailers are still struggling, Best Buy has found its momentum. In the fiscal year ended Jan. 29, the company delivered record revenue and profitability, highlighted by 10.4% same-store sales growth. The stock currently yields 4.1%. Goldman sees Best Buy continuing its dividend growth streak and offering a yield (based on the current price) of 4.3% in 2023. With oil and gas prices shooting through the roof, energy stocks have become some of the healthiest dividend payers in the market. Devon Energy, for instance, recently hiked its quarterly payout by 27% to a record high of $1.27 per share, giving the stock a mouth-watering annual yield of 7.6%. The board also increased the company’s share repurchase authorization by 25% to $2 billion. In Q1, Devon generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow for the quarter, marking an 18% increase year over year. Goldman expects prosperity to persist for the oil and gas producer, projecting a dividend yield of 7.8% in 2023 based on the current stock price. That said, it’s important to note that Devon’s dividend consists of a fixed quarterly payout and a variable dividend that includes up to 50% of excess free cash flow.

5/12/2022,"Editor's Note: This post is breaking and will be updated Disney (DIS) reported second quarter financial results after the bell on Wednesday that missed on both the top and bottom lines, although net additions for its fledging streaming platform Disney+ came in above estimates, causing shares to climb as much as 5% in after-hours trading. Here are Disney's second quarter results compared to Wall Street's consensus estimates, as compiled by Bloomberg: Revenue: $19.25 billion vs. $20.11 billion estimate Adj. earnings per share: $1.08 vs. $1.17 estimate Disney+ subscribers: 7.9 million vs. 4.5 million expected ""Our strong results in the second quarter, including fantastic performance at our domestic parks and continued growth of our streaming services—with 7.9 million Disney+ subscribers added in the quarter and total subscriptions across all our DTC offerings exceeding 205 million—once again proved that we are in a league of our own,"" Disney CEO Bob Chapek said in a press release. ""As we look ahead to Disney’s second century, I am confident we will continue to transform entertainment by combining extraordinary storytelling with innovative technology to create an even larger, more connected, and magical Disney universe for families and fans around the world,"" the executive continued. After competitor Netflix's (NFLX) big subscriber miss last month (the first time the company had lost subscribers during a quarter in 10 years), analysts were cautiously optimistic when it came to Disney+, although a deceleration compared to previous quarters was expected. The company added 11.7 million subscribers in the first quarter of 2022, sharply topping analyst estimates. On a year-over-year comparison basis, the media giant reported a net add of 8.7 million in Q2 2021. The overall subscriber decline comes as inflation remains high, consumers cut costs, and competition intensifies. A lag in content has also been cause for concern. Still, Disney plans to spend a whopping $11 billion on streaming content this year, as part of its overall $26 billion budget for TV and film production. To compare, Netflix spent $17 billion on content in fiscal year 2021, with plans to hit $18 billion in 2022. Disney+, which will open in 53 new markets in the the third quarter of 2022, has 137.7 million global subscribers to date, above expectations of 134.4 million. The company reiterated its target to bring on 230 million to 260 million subscribers to the service by the end of fiscal 2024. For context, Netflix's subscriber count sits at 221.64 million global subscribers. Beyond Disney+, the company will also lean on the theatrical rebound, with top titles like ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" and ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" set to debut later this year. But streaming was not the only positive growth story for Disney this quarter. The entertainment mecca's parks, experience and consumer products business swung to an operating profit of $1.76 billion, surpassing expectations of $1.6 billion and just below last quarter's operating profit of $2.5 billion. Revenue for the segment came in at $6.7 billion, nearing its pre-pandemic total of $7.6 billion in the final quarter of 2019. Unlike the shaky streaming side of the business, analysts remain fairly confident that Disney's sprawling theme parks — a consistently important element to the company's bottom line — will see continued robust growth amid the reopening trade. Disney CEO Bob Chapek also doubled down during the earnings call, saying the parks segment, up 110%, is firing on ""all cylinders."" Still, possible headwinds include inflation impact and recession fears. ""Disney’s share price seems to fall daily as fears mount on both [direct-to-consumer] and recession for Parks,” Wells Fargo's Cahall said. ""We think sentiment on both is overdone. While recessionary fears may prove more temporary — and we expect solid Parks results — DTC is a proper Show Me story,"" he continued. On the earnings call, Disney CEO Bob Chapek will likely be forced to address the company's public battle with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who revoked the company's special tax district after Disney vowed to fight the Parental Rights in Education Act, or what critics have dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill. The controversial bill, which will go into effect on July 1, states, ""Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards."" Parents will be able to sue districts over violations. Chapek initially decided not to speak publicly on the matter, opting instead to work behind the scenes in an attempt to soften the legislation. It didn't work. The executive eventually reversed course following intense backlash over his belated response to the bill. He publicly denounced the act during the company's annual shareholder meeting on March 9, in addition to directly apologizing to employees in a company memo. Chapek, whose contract expires on February 28, 2023, has dealt with a fair amount of controversy during his tenure. In addition to the DeSantis drama and ""Don't Say Gay"" fallout, the executive came under further scrutiny following a now-settled breach-of-contract lawsuit with ""Black Widow"" actress Scarlett Johansson last summer. Disney has a market cap of just over $190 billion. Its shares have fallen more than 30% year-to-date. Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Food Reporter at Yahoo Finance.
