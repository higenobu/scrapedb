4/14/2022,"Australia’s jobless rate remained steadily near its lowest level in almost half a century, with youth unemployment and underemployment levels continuing their recent declines. The economy added more than 20,000 full-time positions in March while shedding fewer than 3000 part-time jobs, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 4.0%, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. “4.0% is the lowest the unemployment rate has been in the monthly survey,” Bjorn Jarvis, head of labour statistics at the ABS, said. Apart from February and March this year, the only other months of 4% unemployment since monthly jobs figures have been released came in February and August 2008. To the disappointment perhaps of a few, the March jobless rate has come in unchanged for the month at 4.0% according to the ABS: https://t.co/3UTaM08fnh pic.twitter.com/YiycThC8xY “The unemployment rate for women fell from 3.8% to 3.7%, the lowest it has been since May 1974,” Jarvis said. “It remained at 4.2% for men, its second-lowest level since November 2008, and just above the rate from December 2021 of 4.1%.” The seasonally adjusted number of hours worked fell by 10m from February, to 1.803bn hours last month.Thursday’s labour forces figures are likely to be watched closely in the federal election campaign, not least following opposition leader Anthony Albanese’s Monday stumble when asked to state the jobless rate. The Reserve Bank will also be watching, as economists tip interest rates will rise soon – most likely from June onwards. On Thursday, the ANZ and Westpac banks became the latest to raise some of their mortgage rates. Overall employment numbers continue to recover from Covid disruptions, with 13,389,900 people now in work, almost 400,000 more than during the worst of the downturn in early 2020. The participation rate remained unchanged from February at 66.4%. Those in jobs continued to increase to near highs, and are now almost 400,000 (or 3%) more than at the depths of the Covid pandemic disruptions in March 2020, the ABS said. pic.twitter.com/96DS3tcDEt Youth employment, covering those aged between 15 and 24, increased by 36,000 last month, shaving another percentage point off the youth jobless rate to 8.3%. “While young people were particularly impacted early in the pandemic and during the Delta period, we have continued to see strong increases in youth employment over the past year,” Jarvis said. The ratio of young people employed to the population was now at its highest level since August 2008, he said. The underemployment rate also decreased by 0.2 percentage points, to 6.3%. Underemployment in Australia, meanwhile, has continued to drop, easing another 0.2 percentage points in March, the ABS said. pic.twitter.com/TK9HDpBJcJ Westpac was the only major bank to predict the 4% jobless rate, with the other three forecasting it would drop to 3.8-3.9%. The market consensus rate was 3.9%. Technically, the March figure is the lowest since the 1970s, coming in at 3.9542384%, the ABS said. That’s lower than the 3.981% recorded in February 2008.

4/14/2022,"Scott Morrison has doubled down on an attempt to blame Labor and the Senate for his own failure to introduce legislation after facing a barrage of questions about his broken election promise to implement a federal integrity commission. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, declared on Thursday that Morrison was dragging his heels on setting up a federal anti-corruption body because he didn’t want his own ministers, or politically charged decision-making in cases like the sports rorts, to face a proper investigatory probe. Flanked on the hustings on Thursday by Bridget Archer – the Liberal backbencher who crossed the floor last year in an effort to force debate about a federal body – Morrison confirmed he would only proceed to implement an integrity commission if he wins on 21 May if Labor supported the government’s widely panned model, and if the Senate failed to amend it. Albanese characterised Morrison’s rationale and conditions as “bizarre”. The Labor leader said the truth was “this prime minister just makes promises and walks away from them”. “This is a prime minister who can’t be trusted to deliver on his commitments next term because he has shown this term that he can’t be trusted,” the Labor leader said. The Morrison government promised a national integrity commission in December 2018, ahead of the 2019 election, after months of dismissing it as a “fringe issue”. After missing its self-imposed 2019 deadline for draft legislation, the Coalition finally unveiled its proposed body in November 2020. The Coalition’s model is a commission that will not conduct public hearings or release reports into alleged corruption by public servants and politicians. The model has been panned by experts for the narrow definition of corruption and high bar for starting investigations. The necessary legislation was never introduced to parliament. Morrison claimed incorrectly on Thursday he had not broken an election promise. He said the government had developed a model for a national integrity commission that would not operate like a “kangaroo court” – which is how the prime minister characterises the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac). “I need bipartisan support to put that in place,” Morrison said. “I am not going to introduce a kangaroo court. “I put forward a detailed plan, a detailed proposal which the Labor party rejects. I have honoured my proposal. The Labor party don’t support it. That is where the issue rests.” Despite never introducing his own legislation into parliament, in part because of concern some Liberals might cross the floor to support amendments strengthening it, Morrison said the government’s proposal was “there, clear and detailed”. “It is there to be supported. It is our policy.” Archer was asked for her view given the Tasmanian Liberal MP last November crossed the floor to support the independent MP Helen Haines’ bill to establish a federal integrity commission. At the time Archer accused the government of “inertia” over the issue and said she was “perplexed” at her own government’s failure to release a revised bill almost three years after it was promised. On Thursday she was asked whether she agreed with Morrison that the NSW Icac was a kangaroo court. She said she’d had limited exposure to the NSW body given she lives in Tasmania. “What I have said and what I will continue to say is that I would like to see the positive promotion of integrity in public life,” Archer told reporters. “There are a lot of ways to achieve that, one of those may be through integrity commission legislation, but there are other ways to achieve that.” She said she would “continue to talk within the government” about advancing that agenda. Morrison was asked what efforts he had made in the Senate to try to advance the government’s integrity commission legislation. He said two attornies general had been in dialogue with other actors in the parliament, but “the problem is, we’re not going to agree to changes which we think are not in the national interest”. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning When Albanese’s contention about the government stalling to avoid anti-corruption probes was put to Morrison, he said: “Anthony having a crack at me is not a substitute for not having an economic plan and not knowing what’s going on in the economy.” While Morrison clearly wants to move on from the issue, he will face renewed pressure from crossbench independents if the coming election is close enough to deliver a hung parliament. A number of independents running against Liberals in metropolitan seats have made it clear that establishing a credible national integrity commission will be a key demand in the event that any new government – Liberal or Labor – is seeking agreements for confidence and supply. Haines has blasted Morrison for his comments. “Mr Morrison broke an election promise to introduce an anti-corruption commission and his pathway to creating one is still as vague as it was in the last parliament.”",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison again blames Labor for Coalition’s failure to deliver federal Icac,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/14/scott-morrison-again-blames-labor-for-coalitions-failure-to-deliver-federal-icac
