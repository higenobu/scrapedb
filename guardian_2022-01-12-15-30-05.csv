1/12/2022,"Outside a small brick house shared by four families, Daniela Prada, who is heavily pregnant, gathers guava leaves to make a tea for her two-year-old son. “My baby gets sick a lot,” she says, boiling a pot of water in her outdoor kitchen. “He always has diarrhoea and last night he had a fever. Most of the time I give him natural medicine.”In an identical house nearby, town leader Oscar Lurici says fevers are a part of life in Eyiyo Quibo village on the Beni River in northern Bolivia. People of all ages suffer from debilitating head and body aches, bouts of vomiting and diarrhoea, memory loss and tiredness. Some children show signs of cognitive development delays.  “We do not know for sure what causes these sicknesses,” Lurici says. “We are starting to think this is all because of water contamination from the mercury found in the mining waste.” Lurici’s 17-year-old son, also called Oscar, began suffering from exhaustion, aches and trembling in early 2019. Various doctors diagnosed ailments such as Parkinson’s disease and anaemia. One suggested the illness came from the contaminated river water. Before the year was out, Oscar had died. Bolivia has long been criticised for using mercury in small-scale gold mining, and growing evidence shows that mercury contamination is causing illnesses in poor communities. Mercury is used across the country, in mining projects in the cordilleras of the Andes and on dredgers extracting gold from the sediment at the bottom of waterways. The uncontrolled disposal of mercury waste creates toxic flows in Bolivia’s river systems. Known as the “people of the river”, the Esse Ejjas survived as nomads for generations, hunting and fishing along the region’s waterways. After settling in Eyiyo Quibo, men and boys continued to fish, spending days travelling the river, camping on its banks and working in pairs to fill their long, narrow wooden boats with catfish and piranhas. In cases around the world, including a study in the Brazilian Amazon published by the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health in 2020, researchers have found fish to be heavily contaminated with mercury, and believe fish-based diets in mining areas are causing increased mercury levels in indigenous people. This could explain some of the illnesses in Eyiyo Quibo. In 2019, representatives of the Bolivian volunteer organisation Reacción Climática took hair samples from women at Euiyo Quibo, including Prada. In total, 64 samples were taken from Euiyo Quibo and Portachuelo, another Esse Ejja community 380km (235 miles) north, for a study by the International Pollutants Elimination Network (Ipen) to evaluate levels of mercury in people living near small mines in four Latin American countries: Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia and Bolivia. Published in June 2021, the study found that women from the Esse Ejja communities, the only participants not living near a mine, had by far the highest levels of mercury – on average almost eight times the accepted threshold of one part per million (ppm), with one sample reaching 32.4ppm. The results suggested a correlation between mercury in the body and fish consumed. The findings rang alarm bells internationally. In September, the UN special rapporteurs on toxics and human rights and on the rights of indigenous peoples, Dr Marcos Orellana and José Francisco Cali Tzay, submitted a letter to the Bolivian government calling out Bolivia’s inaction on the regulation, use, and trade of mercury, with a focus on small-scale gold mining. They gave Bolivia 60 days to respond. In Eyiyo Quibo, where families eat river fish daily, fear is rising. “Sometimes babies here are born deformed, or sick,” Prada says, sitting on the dirt floor of her kitchen. “Now I worry about the health of my children. I worry that they get sick, that they will die from the contaminated fish.” On 8 December, on a hotel patio in Rurrenabaque, north Bolivia, a group of worried Esse Ejjas people huddled around a laptop to hear Orellana speaking at an online event hosted by Reacción Climática and the Bolivian Documentation and Information Centre (Cebid). “Here is where a community lives their life according to their ancient traditions in close relation to their natural resources, including rivers, and they may have been contaminated by activities that are being carried out in other places and for the benefit of other people,” Orellana said. “That is a clear example of environmental injustice.” Orellana’s main issue was the Bolivian government’s lack of engagement with the Minamata Convention on Mercury, an agreement of 128 countries to curb or eliminate almost all uses of mercury, including in small-scale gold mining, which came into force in 2017. Bolivia ratified the agreement in 2015, committing to develop and execute plans to reduce and control mercury markets and protect vulnerable populations from contamination. Yet while neighbouring countries such as Peru have been curbing or eliminating mercury imports, a Cebid report from September 2020 showed that the mercury economy in Bolivia was larger than would be required for the country’s gold output, suggesting Bolivia was now the regional hub of illicit sales. Two days after the online event, Orellana received a response from the attorney general of Bolivia. The letter highlighted state pilot programmes working with miners to promote new technologies to reduce mercury use, and reiterated the laws and Bolivian constitution that call for the protection of the rights and health of indigenous people. Importantly, the document referred to a two-year project to develop a national action plan to address mercury contamination under the Minamata agreement, and another to accelerate the meeting of the commitments of the convention through a multimillion-dollar regional project with its neighbours. The recent international attention has prompted regional and national mining cooperatives to ask the Bolivian government for alternatives to mercury to use in gold mining. “We do not intend to do more damage. On the contrary we want to do responsible mining,” Vicente Choque, president of the Federation of Gold Mining Cooperatives of the North of La Paz, said in a press conference after the government’s response. “We ask the mining authorities, the government and others to propose policies to solve these problems.” For now, the importation, sale, use and re-exportation of mercury in Bolivia remains uncontrolled and the Beni River continues to be poisoned by gold mining activity, its waters reaching some of the world’s most biodiverse regions, where mining activity encroaches on the homes of an unmeasurable number of indigenous people, including the Esse Ejjas. In Eyiyo Quipo, the fishers continue to bring in their catch for families who rely on the fish for food and income. Prada continues to pick medicinal plants to ease her son’s fevers and pains, and worries about what illnesses she may be passing on to her unborn child, due this month. Orellana welcomes the goldminers’ statement as a positive step, but says the government needs to “establish a policy that allows it to decisively control and reduce the use of mercury in small-scale gold mining”.

1/12/2022,"The crane (Grus grus) is a very large bird – the tallest species in Europe – so you’d think it would be easy to find. But the RSPB reserve at West Sedgemoor is not only very large, but out of bounds to visitors, making my task a lot trickier. Fortunately, the viewpoint at the nearby Swell Wood reserve allows me to scan across this vast wetland. And usually, after a few minutes or so, I am able to pick up a pair or two of these stately waterbirds, feeding in one of the waterlogged fields below.  Standing tall and proud, their feathers sticking out behind like a Victorian lady’s bustle, they look almost human. Perhaps that’s why cranes are so revered in cultures all over the world. For more than four centuries, after they were driven out by the draining of wetlands and hunting for medieval feasts, cranes were only an occasional visitor to Britain. But in the late 1970s they returned to the Norfolk Broads, establishing a small breeding population. The cranes here in Somerset were reintroduced a decade ago and are thriving. Seeing them take to the air, while uttering their haunting, echoing calls, reinforces the importance of restoring these wetlands and bringing back the birds that used to live here so long ago.",News/Environment,Birdwatch: the stately waterbird that’s the tallest species in Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/12/birdwatch-the-stately-waterbird-thats-the-tallest-species-in-europe-cranes
1/12/2022,"One in seven people who have tested positive for Covid could still be infectious if released from isolation upon receiving a negative lateral flow result after five days, new data suggests. Across the UK people are now allowed to leave self-isolation on day seven, provided they have had two negative lateral flow tests in the past 24 hours and do not have a fever.  However, the prime minister has indicated he is in favour of further reducing the quarantine time to five days, if backed by scientific evidence. Experts have cautioned there is presently little data to back the move. According to work previously released by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), the proportion of people estimated to remain infectious five days after the onset of Covid symptoms, or a positive Covid test, is 31%. A small Japanese study has similarly suggested a substantial proportion of those infected with the Omicron variant remain infectious at five days. New estimates, released by the UKHSA, have suggested the proportion may still remain high even if lateral flow tests are combined with at least five days of isolation. According to a new report, which is not based on data specific to Omicron, a number of scenarios were modelled including five days of self-isolation followed by five lateral flow tests on days five to nine, with self-isolation ending after a single negative test result. The team then compared the proportion of infectious people who would be released in this scenario with the situation after 10 full days of self-isolation. “This increased the proportion of people infectious when released from self-isolation from 5% to 15%,” the team write. The UKHSA has previously noted that a similar proportion of infectious people – 16% – would be released in a scenario of a seven-day self-isolation period alone, noting this would be “a notably poor solution”. Modelling from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has found “the number of infectious days in the community can be reduced to almost zero” by requiring at least two consecutive days of negative lateral flow tests, “regardless of the number of days’ wait until testing again after initially testing positive”. However, the authors have cautioned that if most individuals are found to test positive for more than five days, the approach may not address the staffing crisis as desired. Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist from the University of Warwick, said: “As the UKHSA data attests, reducing the isolation period to five days runs the risk of highly infectious people returning to work or school and could only be introduced with strict enforcement of lateral flow test,” he said. “This raises a concern about compliance – will people use and report their lateral flow test – and requires plentiful supplies of these tests.” Prof Deborah Dunn-Walters, a professor of immunology at the University of Surrey, said “the public would need to be clearly informed” of the risks involved in leaving isolation early. “[I] can’t imagine anything worse than folks going to visit their vulnerable relatives thinking it is safe when it isn’t,” she said.",News/World news,One in seven could still be infectious after five-day Covid isolation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/still-infectious-five-day-covid-isolation

1/12/2022,"Parents are being warned to look out for signs of a non-Covid virus that is “rife” in the UK amid a surge in reports of children struggling to breathe. The British Lung Foundation (BLF) said Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is staging a comeback this winter after lockdown last year meant there were fewer infections than would normally occur.  It is concerned that this year children will have “much lower immunity” at a time when the NHS is already under extreme pressure. “In the last few weeks, we have noticed a surge in calls from parents who are worried about their child’s breathing,” said Caroline Fredericks, a respiratory nurse who supports the BLF’s helpline. “Most of these parents have never heard of RSV which is worrying.” RSV is common in babies and children. Almost all will have had it by the time they are two. It may cause a cough or cold but for some it can lead to bronchiolitis, an inflammatory infection of the lower airways which can make it hard to breathe. The early symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to those of a common cold but can develop over a few days into a high temperature, a dry and persistent cough, difficulty feeding, and wheezing. While many cases clear up in two to three weeks, some children will end up being hospitalised. “There are steps parents can take to make their child more comfortable at home if their RSV develops into bronchiolitis, such as keeping their fluid intake up, helping them to breathe more easily by holding them upright when feeding and giving them paracetamol or ibuprofen suitable for infants,” said Fredericks. The BLF has already seen a 400% rise in calls to its helpline from parents worried about their child having breathing difficulties in the last three months compared to the same period the year before. During that time an estimated 1,000 children have required hospital care in England alone, it said. It is issuing new guidance for parents which includes asking anyone who has a cough or cold to stay away from young children, making sure that anyone who handles their child washes their hands regularly and to avoid smoking around young children and babies. BLF clinical lead, Dr Andy Whittamore, said: “In general practice, we are seeing a lot of children with coughs and viruses that weren’t circulating last year and so their immunity is lowered. “Doctors on the ground are concerned that alongside a rapid increase in cases of Covid-19, we are also going to see a surge in diseases like bronchiolitis. Some babies do develop severe symptoms with the RSV virus, and warning signs to look out for include if they refuse to feed, are becoming very breathless or if they are breathing in a shallow or irregular way.” Chloe-Ann Ford, 22, from the Isle of Wight, said she knows first-hand how terrifying RSV can be as her baby Teddy, who is 12 weeks old, was hospitalised with bronchiolitis caused by RSV last November. “We had to spend five nights in hospital and Teddy was kept on oxygen,” she said. “On one occasion, he stopped breathing for 28 seconds which was terrifying. “I’d never heard of it [RSV] before and didn’t know how dangerous it could be. Thankfully, Teddy is now recovered but I want all parents of young children to be aware of RSV and to get medical help if their child finds it hard to feed, becomes very breathless or breathes in a shallow, irregular way. It could save their life.”",News/Society,Rise in non-Covid virus that can leave children struggling to breathe,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/12/rsv-virus-infection-uk-rise-children-struggling-to-breathe
1/12/2022,"There’s a rape alarm, stashed somewhere in a drawer in my bedroom. We – the young women – were given them in the first week of university, when some of us had just been released into the world for the first time. In a box under the drawer, there’s a small can of Elnett hairspray. I remember buying two: one for the beehive I was rocking at the time, the other for spraying a man in the face should he attack me, a tip I had read about in Cosmopolitan magazine, because pepper spray isn’t legal in the UK. For a while I kept these in the pocket of my vintage fur coat, until the coat fell apart as I stood on an escalator at Angel tube station (serves me right), and they were forgotten. I remembered the existence of these items, their ultimate futility, when I read about the new women’s safety app backed by the Home Office, created in response to last year’s huge outcry about violence against women. The app, which tracks users’ journeys home, has been rightly criticised by experts as doing nothing to solve the underlying problem of misogyny. As far as I can see, it simply codifies the safety behaviour in which women already engage: “Text me when you get home.” The app gives you a monitored route, and if you move more than 40 metres from it or are still for three minutes, the app asks you if you’re OK. If you don’t reply, it sends a notification to one of your “guardians” (a friend or family member, not patronising or loaded language at all), who can check on you and alert the police.  The shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, Jess Phillips, has referred to it as a “sticking plaster”. I have already mentally consigned it to the dressing table, along with the rape alarm and the hairspray and the myriad other inventions I’ve read about in the course of the 10 years since I was attacked by a stranger on a London street: the straw that tells you if you’ve been spiked, the anti-rape underwear. Please, spare me more attempts to “innovate” our way out of a problem that demands widespread structural change. This app would not have saved me the trauma of a stranger’s hands around my neck, slowly squeezing the life out of me. Perhaps it might have alerted my “guardian” to the fact that I hadn’t moved for three minutes, though if I hadn’t moved, I might have been brain-dead within five. While writing this, I Googled “how long does it take to strangle someone to death?”, but found myself having to close the tab – because, hoo boy, reading about it was still too much, and healing can never be total. In any case, there was an off-duty police officer living nearby who heard my screams and alerted his colleagues, who did not arrive in time. Did he come out of his house? No, he did not. No one did. A passerby came to my aid, eventually. I’m wary to say what else saved me, because the extended implication is that it could have saved other women too – and really, it’s a roll of the dice that depends on so many factors. How your fight or flight kicks in, how big the man is, whether he has a weapon. At about the same time, some other man was dragging women off the street into people’s front gardens and raping them, and some of them were freezing in fear. The fact that I did not freeze is testament to nothing except the cocktail of chemicals in my animal brain at that time. It’s true that I had the self-defence skills, imparted by my mother (thanks, Mum!), and I do believe that self-defence should be taught in schools, but again, it hardly solves the underlying problem. And besides, how sad it makes me to think of all the women out there saying firmly to their little girls: “Knee him in the goolies, gauge him in the eyes, scream as loud as you can.” How sick it makes me, that I’ll probably have to say the same to my own daughter if I have one. I’m also tired of writing about this. I’d like my writing to be powered by joy – at least some of the time – but it’s hard, when you keep seeing the same ill-informed initiatives over and over again, the same mealy mouthed platitudes. Will I see a properly funded, cohesive violence against women strategy in my lifetime? Or will I have to carry on writing variations on the same theme for the rest of my writing career? When do I get to not feel this angry? It all makes me want to scream and shout. The extra police in nightclubs, the “flag down a bus” advice, the AI-operated drones, all of it. The only thing that I find encouraging is the increasing numbers of women, many of them young, who are sick to the back teeth of it all and are taking to the streets, boycotting clubs, raising their voices. The way the vigil for Sarah Everard was policed was a travesty, but the action itself gave me hope. We women at least have each other, though we could do with more men on board, as ever. I predict that these policies will eventually be consigned to a drawer, gathering dust like all those rape alarms, relics of another failed brainstorming session, leaving us where we were before, have always been, since the dawn of time: fighting, or fleeing, or freezing.

1/12/2022,"When Lloyd Williamson lay on his back in a GP’s clinic late last November, it was for the surgical culmination of years of soul searching. Williamson, who is 30 and from Essex, remembers wanting a family as a child, but something changed in his early 20s. “I thought: you know what? I don’t want to bring a life into this world, because it’s pretty shitty as it is and it’s only going to get worse,” he says, two weeks after his vasectomy. Williamson was largely motivated to sterilise himself by the climate crisis. Given the link between fossil-fuelled economic growth and population growth, he believes that having fewer children is one thing individuals can do to help. “We can’t offset our carbon problem on to the next generation, because it’s not fair on them,” he says.  Williamson, who works as a data support officer for Essex county council (he stood unsuccessfully as a Green party councillor in Chelmsford in 2019), says he knows of other young, childless men who are thinking of doing the same thing. While reliable data on vasectomy numbers and motivations is scant, there is growing evidence to suggest that, all over the world, men without children are taking direct action. Nick Demediuk, an Australian GP and one of the world’s most prolific vasectomy clinicians, says most of his patients are fathers over the age of 35. But the doctor, who has completed more than 40,000 procedures since 1981, now estimates that about 200 of the 4,000 patients his clinic sees each year are younger men without kids. About 130 of them say they are doing it for the planet. “In the old days, it was purely lifestyle,” Demediuk says of his younger, childless patients. “They wanted to travel the world, work hard and not be stuck with a kid. And that has shifted, probably over the past three or four years, to where the environment is the dominant reason.” It should not be surprising that a generation with increased awareness of the climate emergency is asking big questions about traditional family structures. In 2019, the then 29-year-old US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez held back tears as she gave a speech about the climate emergency. “I speak to you as a human being, a woman whose dreams of motherhood now taste bittersweet because of what I know about our children’s future,” she told a summit of mayors in Copenhagen. “Our actions are responsible for bringing their most dire possibilities into focus.” A study in 2017 said the single most effective action an individual could take in terms of helping the planet was having one fewer child; this would save more than 25 times the emissions of the next biggest undertakings (living without a car and avoiding long-haul flights). Prince Harry cited the climate when he revealed in a 2019 interview with Vogue that he would not be having more than two children. Matthew Schneider-Mayerson, an associate professor of environmental studies at Yale-NUS College in Singapore, is the author of a forthcoming book about “eco-reproductive” choice. Last year, he carried out a detailed survey of 600 people aged 27 to 45 who were worried about the climate crisis. Of these, 96% worried that their children would struggle to thrive in or even survive the worst-case climate scenarios, while 60% were concerned about the carbon footprint of their potential offspring. Schneider-Mayerson has not explored the rise of the climate vasectomy. It may still be a niche choice, often informed by other factors, including a broader ambivalence about raising children. But it raises ethical and political questions, including about controversial “overpopulation” ideologies, as well as the practical consequences of generationally imbalanced societies. Apart from anything, Schneider-Mayerson says, “it’s sad that people are being forced to factor climate change into this decision”. For Nate Miller (not his real name), a 36-year-old from Colorado, the election in 2016 of Donald Trump, a climate science denier, was the clincher. “I made an appointment to get a vasectomy later that week,” he says. Like Williamson, Miller, who works for an environmental charity, had grown up balancing an assumption that he would have kids with a deepening environmental conscience. “We’re driving ecosystems out of balance and causing mass extinction of countless species,” he says. “I think more people is the very last thing this planet needs.” Other forms of contraception had worked for Miller and his long-term partner, but getting a vasectomy felt like a definitive act. They found a urologist, who booked in Miller after checking he was certain of his decision. Miller also wanted to be reassured, given the widely held view that the procedure is bloody, painful and somehow emasculating. This perception is outdated, Demediuk says. The operation, which used to be more invasive and was carried out under general anaesthetic, is now typically bloodless; there is no scalpel involved. Instead, the scrotum is punctured under local anaesthetic with a tiny pair of forceps, creating a hole just big enough for the vasa deferentia – the two sperm-carrying tubes – to be drawn into the open air. The tubes are cut, sealed and popped back in. Demediuk says the hole rarely requires a dressing, much less a stitch. The process takes 15 minutes and is more than 99% effective. Miller and Williamson say they were back to normal in days. Vasectomies address the gender imbalance that still accompanies the choice and practice of birth control. They come with less risk than more invasive and less reliable methods of female contraception, including sterilisation and the coil. Yet they can be hard to come by, especially for younger, childless men. Williamson had thought about getting a vasectomy in his early 20s, but was put off by grisly stories he heard from older men who had had the procedure years ago. Williamson waited in vain for the still-elusive “male pill” until, at 25, he learned about advances in the vasectomy. He asked his GP if he could have one and was rebuffed. While there are no laws on the age at which men in the UK can get a vasectomy, the NHS advises that they may be more likely to be accepted if they are older than 30 and have children. “Your GP can refuse to carry out the procedure … if they don’t believe it’s in your best interests,” says the guidance, which also warns that reversals are unreliable, with a success rate of 55% within 10 years and only 25% thereafter. Williamson accepts that minds and circumstances can change, but he viewed the guidance as paternalistic. When he turned 30, he tried again. This time, his GP agreed, but said he would have to pay; the Mid Essex clinical commissioning group (CCG) – the GP-led body responsible for buying healthcare services in his area – withdrew funding for vasectomies in 2016 to save money. In an email, it says demand was low; it adds that vasectomies “can be accessed relatively easily without too much financial burden and there are freely available contraceptive methods for women”. Mid Essex was one of nine CCGs that cut or considered cutting funding around the same time, drawing heavy criticism from family-planning charities. When I contact NHS England to establish how widely the procedure has been withdrawn, it says I will need to speak separately to all of England’s 106 CCGs. Access and waiting lists also vary in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Reversals are rarely covered by the NHS and cost thousands of pounds. Williamson’s GP referred him to David Acorn, a GP in Essex who runs a private vasectomy clinic, one of dozens across the UK. Acorn, who charges £360 for the procedure, says Williamson was the first patient he saw who explicitly cited the climate as a reason. But he says he is getting more inquiries from younger, childless men. “I’m particularly keen to make sure they fully understand the potential permanence of what they’re asking for,” he says. Funding cuts may be part of the reason for an apparent decline in vasectomy numbers, but the privatisation of the procedure makes demand hard to track. According to NHS figures, there were almost 20,000 operations in 2010/11 and fewer than 4,500 in 2020/21. Whatever the true figure, family-planning groups are trying to rebrand “the snip” to tempt more men to share the burden of contraception. There is hope that the climate crisis may burnish the vasectomy’s progressive image. In 2012, Jonathan Stack, a 64-year-old American film-maker, co-founded World Vasectomy Day, a campaign dedicated to tackling the stigma and myths surrounding the modern vasectomy. Stack had one himself after having three children. “It’s about gender equity, family planning and more responsible masculinity,” he tells me from his home in New York. World Vasectomy Day is now an annual event and year-round programme that has worked with family-planning groups and public health bodies around the world. Clinicians, who are offered training in the latest no-scalpel technique, have performed almost 100,000 vasectomies as part of the campaign. Four or five years ago, Stack began to notice growing demand among younger, childless men. “A lot of it has to do with a feeling of economic instability and a general sense of uncertainty in life,” he says. Nonetheless, when we speak, he is surprised by an unpublished campaign report he has just received from a project in Bolivia run jointly by World Vasectomy Day, Marie Stopes Bolivia and Université Laval in Canada. In November, four Bolivian physicians received training, part of which involved performing 127 supervised vasectomies. The average age of the patients was 31 and 25% did not have children. When all the men were asked why they were getting a vasectomy, 48% said they didn’t want more kids. What stood out for Stack, though, was that 28% of the men said they were motivated by climate concerns. “Seeing this growing trend of people who don’t have enough faith in the future to believe having a child is a good decision is a little disturbing,” he says. Yet he adds: “What do we read in the news that would make us think this is a great time for kids?” Stack is not alone in having a sense of unease about the push to curb procreation. Demographers have already predicted that the global population will enter a sustained decline by the end of this century, easing demand for resources but fuelling far-reaching shifts in society. A care crisis among older people is already playing out in many parts of the world. In May, China announced it will allow couples to have three children, after the shift of its notorious one‑child policy to two children in 2016 failed to increase the plummeting birthrate. Stack is anxious to distance his campaign from theories of “overpopulation” and their longstanding overlaps with anti-immigration and often racist ideologies such as eugenics and eco-fascism. Paul Ehrlich’s landmark 1968 book The Population Bomb is credited with amplifying the environmental movement, but “populationism” has also been widely blamed for emboldening rightwing population-control and immigration policies. In 2018, the British songwriter and activist Blythe Pepino co-founded the BirthStrike movement, for people who had decided to forgo children in response to the coming “climate breakdown and civilisation collapse”. The well-meaning group made a splash, but shut its website in 2020 because the name BirthStrike “did no end of harm in allowing us to be aligned with the ‘overpopulation’ topic”. Another controversial moral philosophy, antinatalism, calls for the extinction of the human race by ending procreation. “I think there would be some concern if the climate movement becomes closely attached to antinatalism or an ethic that calculates the value of human life and carbon emissions,” says Schneider-Mayerson. Vasectomies don’t necessarily preclude parenting. Rodney Pohl, 26, an IT technician, is planning to foster or adopt with his wife, Carrie, who watched Pohl’s vasectomy at the SimpleVas clinic near their home in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, last June. The couple were motivated partly by weather extremes and what they foretold. A recent polar vortex had taken out the power on their street for 10 days. “We had neighbours breastfeeding small infants and we were sharing generators to try to keep their fridge going, to not waste [expressed] milk,” Pohl says. In Essex, Williamson, who is not in a long-term relationship, says he may also adopt one day. “There are more than enough children and young adults already out there who could have a loving home and family – it doesn’t have to be your own blood,” he says. Neither he nor Miller expect to regret their vasectomies. Pohl says he very occasionally feels pangs of broodiness. “But I quickly move on,” he says. Williamson says he cried after his procedure, but with relief. “It was such a weight off my mind after having all that uncertainty about bringing someone into this world,” he says. He says he wishes that governments were doing more to legislate for the climate crisis, before sharing his thoughts about what is known as “bystander apathy”. “A lot of people are happy to point and say: ‘That’s wrong,’ or film it on their phone,” he says. “I look at the world and say: ‘That’s not right; I’m going to try to do something about it.’”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘More people is the last thing this planet needs’: the men getting vasectomies to save the world,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/12/more-people-is-the-last-thing-this-planet-needs-the-men-getting-vasectomies-to-save-the-world
1/12/2022,"Soon after the brilliant It’s A Sin came out, Russell T Davies justified his decision to cast only gay actors in gay parts by saying: “They are not there to ‘act gay’ because ‘acting gay’ is a bunch of codes for a performance. You wouldn’t cast someone able-bodied and put them in a wheelchair … authenticity is leading us to joyous places.” It would be wrong to suggest that no one questioned this statement, but it became part of an ongoing conversation about casting and minorities. Davies was not, thankfully, mightily abused on social media for saying it – which is what happened last week to Maureen Lipman, after she suggested, on being asked about the casting of Helen Mirren in a biopic of Israel’s former prime minister Golda Meir, that Jewish parts should perhaps be played by Jewish actors.  I’m going to claim some credit – or, for those (and it seems there are many) who hate this suggestion, responsibility – for this, because I’m aware that Lipman (like Sarah Silverman, who said something very similar as regards the castings of Kathryn Hahn as Joan Rivers and Felicity Jones as Ruth Bader Ginsburg) has read my book Jews Don’t Count. It’s a polemic expressing my opinion that, over a period of extreme intensification of the progressive conversation about representation and inclusion and microaggression and what is and isn’t offensive to minorities, one minority – Jews – has been routinely neglected. In the book, some time is devoted to the issue of casting. In terms of this conversation, casting is most directly an employment issue, a correction against previous traditions that have meant less work for minority actors. But it is also – and I would say, at its core more so – about respect. There is something disrespectful, this argument runs, about casting an able-bodied actor in a disabled part, or a cis actor in a trans part, and so on. The deaf actor Marlee Matlin expressed this well when she said: “Deaf is not a costume.” The deep truth of any marginalised identity is only available to those who live that identity. Casting a non-minority actor to mimic that identity feels, to the progressive eye, like impersonation, and impersonation may carry with it an element of mockery – or at least seem reductive, reducing the complexity of that experience by channelling it through an actor who hasn’t lived it. You may not agree with this – you may be one of those people who say actors should be allowed to act – but in the offices of casting directors, the progressive argument has been won. Even in animation, voice actors now need to correspond to the ethnicity or sexuality or gender preference or able-bodied status of their avatars. The risks of outrage if this stricture isn’t followed are too great. The Netflix animation BoJack Horseman is a stone-cold masterpiece, but the show’s creator, Raphael Bob-Waksberg, has apologised profusely because an Vietnamese American character in it, Diane Nguyen, is voiced by the not-Vietnamese at all Alison Brie. In Bojack Horseman, there is another character called Lenny Turteltaub. He’s a turtle, but a very Jewish one, a very Jewish Hollywood producer stereotype, and he’s played by JK Simmons, who is not Jewish. There has been no outcry about that, and Waksberg has seen no need to get anguished about it. This is true across the board: Jewish is the minority that you can cast with actors not of that minority, and hardly, until very recently, hear a whisper of concern. What you can hear, still, if you do raise the issue, is an extremely vehement reaction. This vehemence is about a number of confusions – many see Jews as whites, when it would be truer to say that, as far as racism goes, Jews are Schrödinger’s whites: white or non-white depending on the politics of the observer. Many instinctively see Jewishness as a religion, rather than an ethnicity, and therefore antisemitism as religious intolerance rather than racism, despite, as I’ve pointed out many times, my great-uncle being an atheist not getting him any free passes out of the Warsaw ghetto. But primarily, it’s about Jews being assumed, antisemitically, to be successful and privileged and powerful, and therefore not in need of the protections that identity politics affords other minorities. In the case of casting, that falls down as: “Well, Jews are everywhere in showbiz, so Jewish actors don’t need that leg-up.” It’s odd, then, that so many Jewish parts are not cast with Jewish actors, even when the characters and storylines are very Jewish indeed. Why, if there are so many Jews in showbiz, is Gary Oldman cast as Herman Mankiewicz, or Rachel Brosnahan as Mrs Maisel? Why did the makers of recent BBC drama Ridley Road, about antisemitism in London after the war, have to scrabble around, after I pointed out the lack of Jews in the cast, saying that the female actor playing the main character had just discovered that she had one Jewish grandfather? Why are the four main characters of the only recognisably Jewish sitcom on British TV, Friday Night Dinner, all played by non-Jews, apart from Tom Rosenthal who has publicly disavowed that heritage? If there are so many Jewish actors, they must all be quite shit, as they really aren’t getting the Jewish jobs. And more importantly, as I say, this issue is not really about who gets the work. It’s about the idea that minority experience should be expressed by those who truly know it, rather than caricatured by those who don’t. It would be an interesting conclusion, given 2,000 years of persecution, that the representation of Jewish identity doesn’t deserve this complexity. Despite the use in this argument of the term Jewface, when I watch non-Jews play Jews, it isn’t just about the face. The phrase I use, to cover the whole range of tics and shrugs and stooping and whining and kvetching like I saw in a recent production of Little Shop of Horrors for the playing of the character of Mr Mushnik by a non-Jewish actor – is Nebbish Being. Having a non-Jew do Nebbish Being – if you follow the same logic that would apply if this was a black, gay, trans, disabled or any other minority character, playing-up stereotypical aspects of that minority – is disrespectful, or at least not true, to Jews. It’s complex, all this. I note that many Jews themselves feel uncomfortable with the demand that Jews should play Jews, both for reasons to do with acting but also, more deeply, because many Jews are uncomfortable in general with asking for parity with other minorities within all the microaggressions and callings-out of identity-politics-land. My position on this lack of parity is: whether you want parity or not, it’s worth pointing out. It’s worth saying. I – and Maureen Lipman and Sarah Silverman – have stressed that, yes, actors should be allowed to act. But that isn’t the world we or casting directors live in now, and the question then has to be asked: why should things be different for Jews? In all the aggressive tweeting about Lipman, I saw many photos posted triumphantly of when she once played a vicar in a TV show. Social media loves of course an Aha! meme, and those who hated Lipman for saying her Golda Meir thing posted it luxuriously, as if it proved her bang-to-rights wrong. But minority casting is not a two-way street. Dev Patel can play, obviously, all the brown parts he gets offered, and he can also now play David Copperfield. Michael Fassbender, however, is not going to be up any time soon for Gandhi. The new casting is an industry-wide attempt to right a previous structural wrong, and minorities are now both given a fenced-off right to play themselves, and also allowed to play parts from the mainstream culture. If Jews are part of this, the same ring-fencing should apply to them as regards Jewish parts, but also shouldn’t stop them from being cast as non-Jewish characters from the majority Christian culture too. Which means Lipman can say this about Meir and Mirren – and play all the vicars and priests she wants. But this of course is to imagine that Jews are seen as a real minority. This is to imagine that Jews are understood as much in need of wrongs righting as any other minority. The dial is shifting a little. Tamsin Greig said recently that she “probably shouldn’t” have played a Jewish mother in Friday Night Dinner. This is not the kind of exhaustive apology that some performers, including myself, have given for the historic transgression of playing minorities when they are not a member of that minority. And here’s the thing. I don’t need or want Greig to apologise (she’s a unique case anyway, being a practising Christian with some Jewish ancestry). I think, in fact, that Greig was brilliant in Friday Night Dinner, that she got as close as possible, without caricature, to the reality of writer Robert Popper’s suburban Jewish mum. I believe two things at once – that in an ideal world, non-Jews should be allowed to play Jews, but the fact this allowance already exists, and has up to this point received very little pushback is, in the modern casting context, a discrepancy, and one that needs to be deconstructed, because it says a lot about how people see Jews. It is, as I say, complex. At the end of the day, I don’t know the answer. But I think that I – and Maureen Lipman and any other Jew – should not be abused for asking the question.

1/12/2022,"The UK government is being sued over its net zero climate strategy, which lawyers argue illegally fails to include the policies needed to deliver the promised cuts in emissions. Court papers were filed on Wednesday by ClientEarth (CE) and, separately, by Friends of the Earth (FoE). CE also claims the failure to meet legal carbon budgets would contravene the Human Rights Act by impacting on young people’s right to life and family life.  The net zero strategy was published in October and included commitments to end the sales of new fossil fuel cars by 2030 and gas boilers by 2035. But it did not spell out how the strategy would be delivered or specify the cuts in emissions to be achieved in each sector. Instead, the lawyers said, it relied on speculative technologies such as zero-carbon aviation fuels and extracting carbon dioxide directly from the air and burying it. ClientEarth has defeated the government three times in court in recent years over inadequate air pollution policies, while court victories by Friends of the Earth include a case about the cost of bringing environmental claims against ministers. Both CE and FoE argue that the Climate Change Act requires ministers to set out policies to meet carbon budgets “as soon as reasonably practicable” after they have been set. The assessment included in the net zero strategy shows UK emissions being double the level allowed in 2035 and also missing targets in 2025 and 2030. “A net zero strategy needs to include real-world policies that ensure it succeeds,” said lawyer Sam Hunter Jones at CE. “Anything less is a breach of the government’s legal duties and amounts to greenwashing and climate delay. The government’s pie-in-the-sky approach pushes the risk onto young people and future generations who stand to be hit hardest by the climate crisis.” The FoE action also claims that another government strategy, on heat and buildings, failed to assess its impact on groups protected in law, including children, people of colour and those with disabilities. FoE previously found that people of colour were twice as likely to be living in fuel poverty as white people. “We know that those who do least to cause climate breakdown are too often the hardest hit,” said Katie de Kauwe, an FoE lawyer. “Climate action must be based on reversing these inequalities, by designing the transition with the most vulnerable in mind. Not even considering the implications of the heat and building strategy on such groups is quite shocking.” The government’s official advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), said in October that the net zero strategy was a “big step forward” and the most comprehensive among G20 countries. But its assessment said: “The government has not quantified the effect of each policy and proposal on emissions. So … it is not clear how the mix of policies will deliver on its ambitions.” The CCC highlighted a lack of policies on energy efficiency in homes following a botched green homes grant scheme, on farming, and on reducing the amount of meat and dairy people eat and the number of flights taken. “It’s a very market-led strategy,” said the CCC chief executive, Chris Stark. “We shall see how that fares.” “While the government should of course invest and encourage innovation, the early-stage solutions featured in the strategy can’t make up for the lack of credible near-term action,” said Hunter Jones. He added: “Energy bills are currently soaring, in part because of the UK’s over-reliance on fossil gas for heating and poor levels of insulation. Government failure to deliver real climate action is resulting in higher bills for people.” Following the filing of the claims, and the submission of the government’s defence, the high court will decide whether to grant full hearings of the cases. A government spokesperson said: “The net zero strategy sets out specific, detailed measures we will take to transition to a low carbon economy, including helping businesses and consumers to move to clean and more secure, home-grown power, supporting hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs and leveraging up to £90bn of private investment by 2030.”",News/Environment,UK government sued over ‘pie-in-the-sky’ net-zero climate strategy,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/12/net-zero-climate-strategy-uk-government-sued
1/12/2022,"Police officers who saw laws broken while on guard duty at Downing Street would be expected to report it, a former Scotland Yard police chief has said. The former assistant commissioner Robert Quick was head of specialist operations at the Metropolitan police from 2008 to 2009, including counter-terrorism and protection officers for Downing Street.  His comments come after a huge backlash erupted to an email from a top aide to the prime minister, Boris Johnson, which invited more than 100 people to a party in the Downing Street garden in May 2020, at the height of lockdown restrictions. About 30 to 40 are believed to have attended and the Met is under pressure to investigate. Quick said: “The garden at Downing Street would be monitored by police officers. You would have thought the police would be reasonably aware of what was going on there.” Quick said those guarding sensitive sites, especially those guarding prominent people, had to show good judgment, but the law was paramount. He said: “When you are in a protective environment, then there is a huge amount of discretion required, but that does not extend to looking the other way if the law is broken.” Asked if officers could be told by their bosses to prioritise their protective duties and ignore the law, Quick said: “You could not give that advice to a police officer.” Quick said the Met was in a difficult position after the latest furore over Downing Street parties flouting lockdown rules that everyone else was expected to obey, and if not, be punished by fines levied by the police. Quick said the “layers of emotion” the row attracts make it more difficult for the Met, and added: “When you get these public controversies you do not want to overreact, but public confidence has to be a big part of any decision. “Your first touchstone is the law itself; public confidence is a big part of that equation and your decision-making.” Quick added that the damage to public faith in institutions by the lockdown parties scandal, as well as damaging politicians, could menace policing’s reputation: “This is a seminal moment and people are looking at the system and wondering, does it work? “If the public en masse decide the police have made the wrong decision, it could be very damaging to public confidence.” Quick ran foul of senior Conservative politicians when he launched an inquiry into the leaking of sensitive documents that saw the office of the then Tory frontbencher Damian Green arrested in 2008. No charges followed. That saga helped oust Quick from office in 2009, and his deputy was Cressida Dick. Asked if the experience may have affected the appetite of Dick, now the Met commissioner, for investigating the politically powerful, Quick said: “She saw what happened to me.”",News/UK news,"Police should not ignore any law-breaking at No 10, says senior ex-officer ",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/12/police-should-not-ignore-any-law-breaking-at-no-10-says-senior-ex-officer
1/12/2022,"When Covid hit in 2020, it was a nerve-racking time for many urban developers. As gardens – or the countryside – seemed ever more important for locked-down house hunters, some wondered if their half-finished city apartment blocks would ever find residents. But almost two years into the pandemic, the speculation about “the death of the city” have been proven wrong. Exclusive figures gathered by the Guardian suggest thousands more people are now living in the biggest English city centres since Covid first hit the UK – mostly in flats, often without balconies or outdoor space.  In Liverpool, the city centre population increased by almost 6% in 2020 to 48,594, up 2,754 on 2019, according to the local authority. Leeds city council estimates that 5,000 more people are living in its centre now than in 2019, among them staff at Channel 4, which opened its “national headquarters” in the city earlier this year. “We estimate the total population to now be around 38,000,” said a spokesperson. Demand is rising in central London as renters return to the city centre, according to the Greater London Authority’s December 2021 housing report. Data from Rightmove shows a rent price increase of 11.1% since November 2019 and an annual increase in house prices of 2.7%. In Manchester, the city centre population is now 69,835, up 4.9% on 2021, according to estimates from the council. “Despite Covid-19, Manchester remains the fastest growing city in England – and the population of the city centre is expected to be close to 100,000 by 2025,” said Gavin White, the council’s executive member for housing and employment. “The pandemic has not deterred people wishing to live in the city and this is because of a combination of factors. The number of jobs being created (including specialist sectors like advance manufacturing, digital and tech), culture, sport – and not just football – along with a rate of graduate retention not seen previously; these are all reasons why Manchester continues to enjoy enviable city growth.” Others point out that a city centre exodus may not have come to pass because some flat owners are stuck, unable to sell up because of issues with cladding and fire safety. In Manchester city centre there were only 870 properties sold in 2020-21, a 75% reduction on 2019-20. In its annual State of the City report, the council blames the drop on “significant constraints on the supply of suitable accommodation to buy (linked primarily to cladding and fire-safety concerns)”. On Monday the government unveiled a £4bn package designed to let more leaseholders escape costs for replacing combustible cladding and pledged new laws to protect them from other safety defect costs. Many of the new city centre residents are renters rather than buyers, often living in luxury blocks with gyms and paying £2,000 a month for a two-bed flat. A lot of these flats are bought “off-plan” by investors. Off-plan purchases (before construction) are particularly booming outside London. Figures from Hamptons estate agents showed 40% of new homes were sold off-plan in the capital in 2021, compared with 61% in Birmingham, 58% in Manchester, 60% in Liverpool and 45% in Leeds. The rapid rate of development in Manchester’s centre led to fears of “zombie blocks” left unoccupied. But according to the State of the City report, only 1% of properties there have remained empty for more than six months. A growing number of family homes have also been constructed in Manchester, prompting the council to build its first city centre primary school for generations. The 210-place school and 26-place nursery will be located at Crown Street, a new development in the Deansgate ward, and is expected to open in September 2023. Leeds is also planning major city centre expansion over the next decade. A council spokesperson said: “Up to 2033, the local plan has capacity for a further 18,000 new homes in the city centre and its fringe across 110 sites, which is consistent with the council’s strategy to maximise the capacity of sustainable locations and the re-use of brownfield sites for residential use. “Over half of these homes already either have detailed planning consent or are under construction. Based on current occupancy assumptions, this would see growth of 27,000 additional city centre residents.”",News/Society,Fears of pandemic exodus from England’s cities prove unfounded,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/12/fears-of-pandemic-exodus-from-englands-cities-prove-unfounded
1/12/2022,"No good deed goes unpunished – as is the case with Wordle, the viral linguistic guessing game which found itself with a deluge of apparent clones flooding Apple’s App Store this past week. Initially created by software engineer Josh Wardle for his partner, a puzzle aficionado, the brainteaser skyrocketed in popularity earlier this year, blooming from just 90 daily players in November to now more than 2 million.  While Wardle’s game is entirely housed in a web browser, a host of apps – in an apparent effort to capitalise on Wordle’s popularity – soon sprang up with names like What Word – Wordle, Wordus and Wordle 3D. All of them appeared to mirror the mechanics – and even look – of the original puzzle, where players have six tries to guess a five-letter word each day. In the most striking example, titled Wordle – The App, users were offered a free trial as well as a US$30 annual subscription for a premium-tier version. Its developer, New York-based entrepreneur Zach Shakked, bragged on his Twitter account about monetising Wardle’s game, which is completely free. It was later taken down, and Shakked said he had “crossed a line” but maintained that it was a generic word game, that the name Wordle was not trademarked and claimed he had not made any money from his app. This guy shamelessly cloned Wordle (name and all) as an F2P iOS game with in-app purchases and is bragging about how well it's doing and how he'll get away with it because Josh Wardle didn't trademark it. So gross. pic.twitter.com/kIs8BypuRA Everyone, I'd like to address some tweets I've seen suggesting that my new iOS game, ""Worgle"", is ""a copy"" or ""stole"" Wordle. Nothing could be further from the truth, they're completely different games. For example in Wordle you guess words, whereas in Worgle, you guess worgs “I am a bit suspicious of mobile apps that demand your attention and send you push notifications to get more of your attention,” Wardle has previously said in a BBC Radio interview. “There are also no ads and I am not doing anything with your data, and that is also quite deliberate.” Many apparent copycats have since been removed from the App Store, though not before users took to social media to lament the murkiness of copyright laws. Others viewed the clone apps as a direct assault on the nature of Wordle, which is “simple, fun, satisfying and free” and an antidote to cynicism, as described in the Guardian. “This is why tech culture sucks,” read one tweet. any attempt to monetize wordle (the only pure and good thing going right now) should be met with utter disdain https://t.co/hBzVPMFpyM The masculine urge to monetize Wordle Others have pointed out that Wordle itself seems to draw inspiration from other language puzzles, including American TV show Lingo – which also featured a five-letter guessing game.

Among the free-to-play Wordle-style games online are Queerdle, which describes itself as a “yassification of Wordle” with a pink background and more risque solutions; Sweardle, dedicated to four-letter expletives; and the infuriatingly absurd Letterle – where users have 26 tries to guess just a single letter. this is a nightmareLetterle 26/26⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜🟩https://t.co/KS3DBqyFLg",Arts/Games,‘The only pure thing right now’: alleged Wordle copycats criticised for monetising free game,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/12/the-only-pure-thing-right-now-alleged-wordle-copycats-criticised-for-monetising-free-game
1/12/2022,"Every derelict farm building houses tangible memories of lost lives or livelihoods. A chipped teacup from the last cuppa, a key without a lock, a horseshoe on the floor of a Hebridean blackhouse. Abandoned, discarded and forgotten objects spark my imagination with stories that can become more real than the buildings themselves. Ever since the pandemic began, I have puzzled over one such object in a tumbledown ruin a 10-minute walk from my house. Before then, the onion barn – a two-storey weatherboarded wooden structure – had rarely received more than a sideways glance from the wheel of my car, for it was marooned on the shoulder of a dual carriageway. But when the rivers of traffic ran dry during the first lockdown, the A1 reverted in character to the old Great North Road, and the approach of a vehicle became an event. My daily exercise sometimes took me along the verge to the fence around this barn, a rare survivor out of dozens that sprang up in the 19th century, during Sandy’s onion-growing heyday.  Decades of gales and gravity have pulled down the rear half, unclad cladding from the front, exposed timbers, shed clay pantiles from the roof, and dislodged others to hang precariously over the eaves. Posts along the open-fronted ground floor still support the loft, where the onions were hung up to dry and stored. Long metal hooks hang useless over a band of narrow slats, where shutters once opened to air the crop. In common with other onion barns of the area, there are no stairs from ground level to the first floor, only a small rectangular hatch through which workers would poke a ladder to ascend into the reeky upper storey. Standing before the doorless frame of the loft, I spied the oddest of leftovers. Facing towards the hatch, as if awaiting a head poking up through the gap, is a simple but elegant chair. It has a high back with gentle curvature and a carved pattern where a tired labourer’s spine would rest. Why was it left here? That question will gnaw at me long after the whole barn has fallen.
