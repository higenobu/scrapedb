12/30/2021,"After a period of unprecedented, sustained success, the Seahawks have bottomed out. Now, they’re at a crossroads. Defeat to the Bears last Sunday dropped the Seahawks to 5-11 on the season. They have no shot at making the playoffs. The roster features a rotating morass of mediocrity. There are questions about the future of their franchise quarterback, head coach and chief personnel decision-maker.  Things could be about to get ugly. There remains an oft-repeated myth around Seattle that the Russell Wilson-Pete Carroll partnership turned sour once the franchise quarterback started to get paid like a franchise quarterback. The theory makes some sense. The Seahawks were the first team to truly take advantage of the modern Collective Bargaining Agreement that turned a quarterback on a rookie contract into the sport’s leading market inefficiency. Seattle had Wilson on the cheap, and it was able to surround him with a bevy of Hall of Famers slap-bang in the middle of their primes. Carroll, Wilson and the vaunted Legion of Boom stomped all over the NFC on their way to two Super Bowls, winning one and dropping the other to the Brady-Belichick Patriots, falling one yard short of back-to-back titles. It would be neat and easy if things took a sudden downshift from there; if paying Wilson was the sole reason for the decline – the expense of a $30m per year quarterback meaning talent leaking out of the roster elsewhere. It’s also inaccurate. This year represents Carroll’s first losing season as a coach since 2011. Since the Seahawks drafted Wilson in 2012, few if any franchises have matched the pair’s success, including the period in which Wilson was signed to an extension. Tampa Bay with Brady, Kansas City with Mahomes, and New Orleans with Drew Brees certainly had (and have) no issues maintaining a championship-caliber roster with a quarterback subsuming more than 20% of the salary cap. Patrick Mahomes, Dak Prescott and Josh Allen all absorb a higher percentage of their team’s cap sheet, on average, than Wilson. It is not a question of Seattle being able to sign, draft or trade for talent that would fit under the cap to support Wilson. It’s about who the Seahawks have opted to sign, draft and trade for. This season is the result of a near-decade of iffy draft and personnel decisions, dating back to the very start of the Wilson era. Since 2013, the Seahawks have made 15 draft picks in the first or second round. Only one, DK Metcalf, has made a Pro Bowl. Three – Metcalf, Frank Clark, Jarran Reed – would be considered above average players. Only one of those, Metcalf again, remains with the team. On top of that, they traded first-rounders for Jimmy Graham, Percy Harvin and two first-rounders for Jamal Adams. All three were misses; the Adams whiff not only hit the team talent-wise but also forced Seattle to completely re-define the stylistic makeup of their defense to try to accommodate his weaknesses. A franchise quarterback and a savvy, defense-first coach can only cover up so many defects. At some point, the other players must make some plays. Seattle simply lacks talent. That’s partly why Wilson looked to bail on the whole enterprise last offseason. As he’s always very keen to point out, Wilson did not demand a trade. He simply pointed out the four specific teams he would like to go to if Seattle wanted to trade him, which, obviously, he did not want. No, sir. It was a masterclass in petty. The carefully coordinated media leaks. The Tune Out The Noise social media onslaught. As reported by the Athletic, Wilson believed things had grown stale. It was reported that Wilson, and others, had started to tune out Carroll’s happy-clappy style. The Seahawks have tried to evolve in all the ways Wilson would ever demand. They shifted philosophies on defense, trying to keep up with all of the game’s latest innovations, rather than sticking doggedly to the style that drove them through their initial period of success. On offense, there has been a willingness to change things, too. From the caveman stylings of Brian Schottenheimer and Darrell Bevell, the Seahawks looked to get younger and slicker by bringing in Shane Waldron from the Rams to run the offense. But any sense of the Seahawks embracing the confuse-and-clobber style that powered the Jared Goff era Rams has not come to fruition. There are two reasons: a) defenses finding counters to that style of offense (the Seahawks missed on when they wanted to jump into that evolutionary cycle); b) Russell Wilson. At this point, it’s clear there’s not a Seahawks style or a Schottenheimer style or a Waldron style or a Carroll style. It’s Wilson’s style. His unwillingness to throw over the middle of the field has taken on meme-level proportions this season. Wilson has attempted just 26 passes of 10 yards or more over the middle of the field this season, an average of two a game. By comparison, Tom Brady is averaging seven such attempts a game, Aaron Rodgers is averaging five, Patrick Mahomes is averaging four. In fact, among 34 eligible quarterbacks this season, Wilson ranks 29th in the league in the average number of attempts per game he targets beyond ten yards in the middle of the field. To play in a Russell Wilson offense means to forfeit the middle of the field, which constricts whatever Seattle might like to do on offense. This has been a long-running theme to Wilson’s game. It’s why he’s able to limit turnovers, but in playing such a compressed style defenses can better cut off his supply line outside. Wilson’s game has always been built around the deep ball. He takes the easy guff underneath and launches delightful darts down the field to move the Seahawks offense along. This year, as defenses vacate the middle and focus on the perimeter, his effectiveness has tumbled. His adjusted completion percentage (which removes throwaways) ranks 23rd among eligible quarterbacks this season on throws of 20 yards or more, per Pro Football Focus. That puts him behind Davis Mills, Tua Tagovailoa, Carson Wentz and a fossilized Ben Roethlisberger, hardly a who’s who of Favre-ian gunslingers. As much as the offense needed to adapt and grow coming into the year, so did its pilot. He did not. Wilson then got hurt. Before the Seahawks could blink, the season had slipped away. As this offseason approaches, Seattle’s ownership now faces a tricky choice: to move on from Carroll; to move on from Wilson; to move on from everyone, including John Schneider, the personnel czar. There’s little to no chance all three will return. Two of them? Maybe. Carroll departing seems the most likely outcome. Whether or not Wilson’s season-long slump is indicative of anything longer-term, the Seahawks want nothing to do with the annual quarterback merry-go-round. Moving on from Carroll is likely the team’s best shot to convince the quarterback to stick around long-term. Carroll deserves credit for his willingness to re-energize the franchise, for trying to evolve rather than getting stuck in his own fuddy-duddy ways. This isn’t the story of a coach who stayed too long, or an organization that went down thinking its way would always be The Way. This is a team that paired a talented quarterback with an excellent coach and an extraordinary roster and ran through the league like few before. Two remain true, yet the final and most important part, the core of the roster, has sunk to depressing levels of incompetence. Now, they need a reboot. “Not for one reason at all am I thinking that we need to restart the whole thing,” Carroll said this week. There is some truth there. The Seahawks will be flush with the cap space needed to re-fashion the roster around Wilson if the quarterback wishes to stick around. But the Seahawks do need a fairly dramatic overhaul. Making a break from coach and quarterback at this stage would be easier than betting on the two to rediscover their old mojo.",Sport/Sport,Wilson or Carroll?

12/30/2021,"In the summer of 2020, the London-based psychotherapist Zoë Aston hit the headlines with a scream-therapy campaign she had devised for the Icelandic tourism board. On a website called Looks Like You Need Iceland, visitors were invited to record a scream which would then be blasted out for you in the vast, frozen wilderness. “And when you’re ready,” the blurb ran, “come let it out for real. You’ll feel better, we promise.” All of which assumes a scream-readiness with which I am patently unfamiliar. I am famous in my family for never shouting when I drop a glass or cut myself in the kitchen. The bigger the mess, the quieter I get. The angrier I get, the quieter I get, too. I have never screamed or shouted anyone down. A while back, the thought occurred to me that this might be a problem. What if, one day, I needed to yell? What if I, or someone else, needed the kind of urgent attention a scream is designed to attract?Reading the psychologist Art Janov’s 1970 book The Primal Scream does not help. This is at least partly due to its terrifying cover art, which features a bald figure with a cleft cranium, out of which gapes a screaming red mouth full of teeth – a nightmarish vision matched only by the intense embarrassment I feel just thinking about what therapists call “primaling”. I don’t want to primal. Or vent. Or rage. It’s the actual, audible how-to that’s the problem.  As keen as I am to step out of my comfort zone and start yelling, part of me wonders if my fear of doing so isn’t self-generating and redundant. Fight or flight is an involuntary physiological reaction to a threat – so surely I’ll scream if I need to, whether I think I can or not? Aston is not so sure. Depending on how extroverted or introverted you are, she explains, research shows that, when faced with a perceived threat, you might not scream: “It might actually deactivate your voice,” she says. Learned behaviours come into it, too. If, like me, you’ve always been the quiet one, that’s likely where you’ll get your sense of safety. “Taking up more energetic space might, conversely, feel very unsafe.” To unpick that association of “loud” with “bad”, she suggests I try ever louder singing, or positive affirmations. “Something like, ‘I love you’ or ‘I am enough’,” she says. It’s about telling yourself that loud doesn’t necessarily mean anger or danger; that it can be a useful tool.I ask my friend Shahanara if she knows she can scream. “Uh, yeah,” she says. Then she tells me how, during a period of intense work, she’d get on a train to Farthing Downs in Surrey – the closest bit of countryside to where she lives – for exactly this purpose. “You’d take the train to go to scream in a field in Surrey?” I say, bemused. Then I ask if she’ll go to Surrey with me.Walking towards her chosen scream-spot, I listen to the rain falling on my jacket hood and I cannot fathom how or why I’d shatter this quiet. The quiet is what I live for. I have brought along my field recorder and mic, hoping that viewing the expedition as an artwork will somehow take the edge off, but they stay firmly stashed in my rucksack. First, Shahanara demonstrates an extraordinary ability to go from quiet up to a full-body scream and back again. When nothing terrible happens as a result of this bellowing, I find the courage to try it myself.I start by just naming things loudly. That tree. Those clouds. That tree! It’s the loudest I’ve ever heard my voice and, for a soaking wet Monday afternoon, it’s not too shabby, if not quite a full scream. Back home, days later, I finally turn up the volume on the first song that comes to mind, the one that consistently gives me the most energy, the one that feels like fire – Face Tat by Zach Hill – and without thinking too much I smash my face into a cushion and yell. Ha. I’ve got more range than I’d figured. It comes out more “high screech” than scream – I feel like a parrot under a blanket. I still can’t imagine doing it without the cushion, but I have to tell you, since then I’ve approached Zoom meetings, school runs and deadlines with a new sense of possibility.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Escape your comfort zone: I have always been the quiet one.

12/30/2021,"Even amid the torrent of praise for the revered former archbishop Desmond Tutu in the days since his death, the anti-apartheid champion is not being universally mourned. Alan Dershowitz, the renowned US constitutional lawyer and ardent defender of Israel, took a moment to brand Tutu as “evil” and “the most influential antisemite of our time”. “The world is mourning Bishop Tutu, who just died the other day. Can I remind the world that although he did some good things, a lot of good things on apartheid, the man was a rampant antisemite and bigot?” he told Fox News.  Dershowitz accused Tutu of minimising the Holocaust and of comparing Israel to Nazi Germany – an extreme interpretation of the former archbishop’s statements that takes some convolutions to reach. But Tutu’s real crime in the eyes of Israel’s most unrelenting supporters was to liken its rule over the Palestinians to apartheid and then refuse to back off in the face of an onslaught of abuse. On his visits to Israel and Palestine, Tutu would have immediately recognised echoes of his homeland in the forced removals, the house demolitions, the humiliations of checkpoints and systems of control on movement, the confiscation of land for Jewish settlements, and the confining of Palestinians to blobs of territory, reminiscent of the Bantustan black homelands. Above all he saw one people controlling another who, like black South Africans until 1994, had little say in their governance. Tutu was not alone in his view. Former US president Jimmy Carter drew similarly vitriolic accusations from Dershowitz and others when he published his bestselling book, Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, in 2006. But Tutu was harder to attack. He not only had the authority of a Nobel peace prize awarded for his courageous stand against white rule in South Africa but he knew apartheid when he saw it. Nearly two decades ago Tutu told a conference in Boston: “I’ve been very deeply distressed in my visit to the Holy Land; it reminded me so much of what happened to us black people in South Africa.” A few years later he was even more direct. “I know first-hand that Israel has created an apartheid reality within its borders and through its occupation. The parallels to my own beloved South Africa are painfully stark indeed,” he wrote in 2014 in a call for the Presbyterian general assembly in the US to back sanctions against Israel. A figure of Tutu’s stature drawing parallels between a system constructed on racism and the reality of Israel’s domination of the Palestinians, and calling for boycotts to end it, alarmed the government in Israel. With the two-state solution moribund at best, Israel is faced with a growing movement that sees the conflict through the moral prism of civil rights and injustice – a framing that has historic resonance in the US in particular and has taken on additional significance in the age of Black Lives Matter. While Tutu was critical of Palestinian attacks, his implicit likening of Israelis to white South Africans during apartheid challenged the Jewish state’s longstanding narrative to portray itself principally as a victim of Arab aggression and terrorism, and to exclude the part played by occupation and settlements in the conflict. Others have made the charge, including a string of former Israeli cabinet ministers and officials who say they can no longer deny the reality that their country is practising a form of apartheid. Two former Israeli prime ministers, Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, have drawn parallels with the old South Africa. But Tutu carried a moral authority wielded surpassed only by the man who epitomised the anti-apartheid struggle, Nelson Mandela. Tutu justified the calls for a boycott of Israel in the Tel Aviv newspaper Haaretz. South Africa, he said, had extraordinary leaders at the time it mattered. “But what ultimately forced these leaders together around the negotiating table was the cocktail of persuasive, nonviolent tools that had been developed to isolate South Africa, economically, academically, culturally and psychologically,” he said. The former archbishop knew that it would only happen if ordinary people mobilised, having witnessed considerable western collusion with apartheid. The US government listed the African National Congress as a terrorist organisation while backing white South Africa’s war in Angola. Margaret Thatcher was an ardent opponent of sanctions against the apartheid regime. Separately, Tutu warned that it was not possible to be a neutral bystander.“Those who turn a blind eye to injustice actually perpetuate injustice. If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor,” he said. All of this earned Tutu a particular ire from some of Israel’s defenders. The Anti-Defamation League accused him of antisemitism over his boycott call. Others dug into the distant past and latched on to a call Tutu made for forgiveness during a visit to Jerusalem’s Yad Vashem memorial for Europe’s murdered Jews in 1989. “We pray for those who made it happen, help us to forgive them and help us so that we in our turn will not make others suffer,” he said. Dershowitz characteristically gave Tutu’s call the most extreme interpretation by describing it as having “demanded that Jews forgive the Nazis for killing them”. In reality, Tutu consistently sought to reassure Jewish communities around the world that he understood their history and their concerns, but he saw no reason not to continue calling the occupation as he saw it. The former archbishop would have been pleased that others increasingly embraced his perspective. This year, Human Rights Watch in the US and Israel’s most prominent human rights group, B’Tselem, published groundbreaking reports describing Israel’s domination of the Palestinians as apartheid. But ultimately Tutu’s intent was not to condemn. His calls for forgiveness fitted with his belief that it is an essential step toward justice and peace – a view central to his chairing of South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Tutu saw how everyone was liberated, white people included, when apartheid ended in South Africa. He wanted Israelis to liberate themselves from the burden of apartheid too.

12/30/2021,"The Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Global has reported widening losses and a decline in third-quarter revenue, after its domestic business took a hit from a regulatory crackdown by Beijing. The company said operating losses hit $6.3bn (£4.68bn) in the nine months to the end of September, while revenue fell nearly 2% in its third quarter.  Chinese authorities have come down hard on Didi since its New York Stock exchange listing in June, demanding that it take down its software from mobile app stores while the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) investigated its handling of customer data. The restriction came as a blow for Didi – co-founded in 2012 by former Alibaba employee Will Wei Cheng and backed by SoftBank Group – which was the dominant ride-hailing company in China. The company now faces stiff competition from ride-hailing services by automakers Geely and SAIC Motor. Under pressure from Chinese regulators concerned about data security, Didi decided in December to delist in New York and pursue a Hong Kong listing. Shares in Didi soared after its initial public offering (IPO), giving the company a valuation of $80bn and marking the biggest US listing by a Chinese firm since 2014, but have since declined by 65%. Didi said on Wednesday its board had authorised it to pursue a listing of its class A ordinary shares on the main board of the Hong Kong stock exchange. “The company is executing above plans and will update investors in due course,” Didi said. The company also announced that Daniel Zhang, the chief executive officer of the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba who had served as a director on Didi‘s board since 2018, has resigned.

12/30/2021,"UK house prices rose by more than 10% in 2021, the fastest growth rate in 15 years, according to new figures that underline the strength of the pandemic housing boom. The price of an average UK home hit a record high of £254,822 in December, up nearly £24,000 over the year, according to data published on Thursday by Nationwide, the UK’s largest building society.  Prices are now 16% higher than before the pandemic struck in early 2020, an outcome few economists anticipated as the UK’s nations were embarking on the first in a series of lockdowns. Yet after the initial freeze in activity, the housing market has remained buoyant throughout the pandemic. People forced to spend more time at home have looked for more space, while the UK government also heavily subsidised the market with a temporary cut in stamp duty and interest rates have remained near historic lows. The 10.4% annual growth rate in December was the strongest since 2006 and represented a slight acceleration from the 10% rate in November, although annual growth has been in double figures since May, barring a slight slowdown in October after the end of the stamp duty holiday. In June, annual price growth reached 13.4%, the fastest since 2004 during the housing bubble before the global financial crisis. In contrast, average earnings rose by 4.9% in the year to October, according to the Office for National Statistics. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said continuing high demand and a persistently low stock of homes on the market had contributed to the soaring prices, but added that a slowdown may be on its way in 2022 – and particularly if the Bank of England follows December’s interest rate rise with further increases in the coming year. “It appears likely that the housing market will slow next year, since the stamp duty holiday encouraged many to bring forward their house purchase in order to avoid additional tax,” he said. “The Omicron variant could reinforce the slowdown if it leads to a weaker labour market. Even if wider economic conditions remain resilient, higher interest rates are likely to exert a cooling influence.” Wales was the UK region with the fastest house price growth over a calendar year, 16%, for the first time since Nationwide started collecting the data in 1973. The south-west was England’s fastest-increasing region, corroborating separate data from Halifax, part of Lloyds Banking Group, which showed that Taunton was the town with the strongest annual price growth, at above 20%. Halifax’s measure of annual house price growth came in at 6.2%. London, where house prices are already elevated, was the slowest-growing region, with prices rising by 4.2%. The capital was the only region in which price growth did not accelerate during 2021 compared with 2020. Nationwide’s measure of affordability showed that a London buyer with a 20% deposit would have to be in the top 10% of earners to be able to buy at the average price.",News/Business,UK house prices in 2021 show fastest growth rate in 15 years,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/30/uk-house-prices-in-2021-show-fastest-growth-rate-in-15-years
