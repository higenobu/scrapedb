3/31/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has told the Australian parliament that his country is “undefeatable” against Russia as long as it can count on the support of the global community. In a virtual speech to MPs and senators in Canberra, the Ukrainian president requested Australia send Bushmaster armoured vehicles to assist in the fight against Russia, saying they would “do much more for our common freedom and security than staying parked on your land”. “You have very good armoured personal vehicles, Bushmasters, that could help Ukraine substantially, and other pieces of equipment that could strengthen our position in terms of armaments,” Zelenskiy said. Zelenskiy accused Vladimir Putin of “nuclear blackmail” and said that an unchecked Russia was a “threat” to the world, suggesting its actions may inspire other nations to follow suit, in a thinly veiled warning to the parliament he was addressing. “The distance between our countries is big, it’s thousands of kilometres … but there’s no such thing as distance for the brutality and chaos that Russia brought to the east of Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said. “Whatever is happening in our region because of the Russian aggression … has become a real threat to your country and your people as well,” he said. “This is the nature of the evil. It can instantly cross any distance, any barriers, destroy lives.” Zelenskiy, clad in his now-signature black T-shirt, spoke via an interpreter on video link to a packed House of Representatives on Thursday night. He called for Russia to pay “the highest price” and for allies to impose even tougher sanctions, such as blocking Russian vessels from foreign ports and boycotting the country’s oil. Before Zelenskiy’s address, Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, called Putin “the war criminal of Moscow” in his strongest condemnation of the Russian president yet. Morrison also announced an extra $25m in military assistance for Ukraine, including unmanned aerial and ground systems, rations and medical supplies. The commitment takes Australia’s military contributions to Ukraine to $116m. Earlier on Thursday, the Australian government vowed to slug all imports from Russia and Belarus with an extra 35% tariff. In a statement, Morrison called out “Russia’s brutal, unrelenting and illegal invasion” of Ukraine, and said the government “will continue to identify opportunities for further military assistance”. Morrison praised Zelenskiy as a “lion of democracy”. Labor leader Anthony Albanese slammed Putin for “aggression in the name of a poisonous, nationalistic lie”. “You are showing us what true courage is,” Albanese said, speaking directly to Zelenskiy. The Ukrainian president warned that other nations may follow Russia’s lead in attacking their “neighbours” unless the world stood up now – in a clear reference to China, which has so far resisted taking a stronger line in discouraging Putin’s aggression. “The worst pages of the 20th century have been brought back by Russia already. The biggest threats of that century came back, the evil that humanity thought they had forgotten about a long time ago,” Zelenskiy said. “But the most terrible thing, if we don’t stop Russia now, if we don’t hold Russia accountable, then some other countries of the world who are looking forward to a similar war against their neighbours will decide that such things are possible for them.” The president also spoke confidently and optimistically about the future of his country. “We know that our dream is undefeatable and undestructable , especially if we can count on the support of the free world, on your support, on your assistance,” he said. “We need it not just in a couple of months, we need it urgently, now.” Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s citizens were “already thinking about the future, about how we’re going to live after the war, and of restoring our country”. Australia has provided $156m in support to Ukraine since Russia began its invasion in February, including $91m in “lethal and non-lethal military assistance”, Tuesday evening’s budget papers confirmed. Australia also plans to offer Ukrainians fleeing the conflict a three-year temporary humanitarian visa. It has also joined a range of countries imposing sanctions on Russia. On Thursday, Morrison said the Australian government was “taking further action to increase the economic costs to Russia after its illegal invasion of Ukraine, supported by Belarus, by applying an additional tariff of 35% for all imports from Russia and Belarus”. Australia does not have a huge trading relationship with Russia. In 2019-20, Australia imported $250m in goods from Russia, such as fertilisers ($71m) and crude petroleum ($59m). By contrast, Australia exported $723m in goods to Russia in 2019-20, including live animals, specialised machinery and meat, according to data compiled by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Dfat listed Australia as a lowly 94th on the list of Russia’s main export destinations before the pandemic. The Australian government has been particularly critical of the growing alignment between Russia and China – concerns shared by a top UK intelligence chief. The director of GCHQ, Sir Jeremy Fleming, told an audience in Canberra that there were risks to both Russia and China from being “too closely aligned”. “Russia understands that long term, China will become increasingly strong militarily and economically. Some of their interests conflict; Russia could be squeezed out of the equation,” Fleming said in a speech to the Australian National University. “And it is equally clear that a China that wants to set the rules of the road – the norms for a new global governance – is not well served by close alliance with a regime that wilfully and illegally ignores them all.”",News/World news,Volodymyr Zelenskiy asks Australia to send armoured vehicles to help fight Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/volodymyr-zelenskiy-asks-australia-to-send-armoured-vehicles-to-help-fight-russia
3/31/2022,"The UK economy was only 0.1% below pre-pandemic levels after growing faster than previously thought at the end of 2021 because of an increase in visits to GPs and a rush of coronavirus test-and-trace activities, the latest official data has shown. UK economic output grew by 1.3% from October to December, compared with a first estimate of 1%, despite the Omicron variant denting output over Christmas, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Thursday. Revisions to estimated growth in 2021 and 2020 mean the economy is now thought to have ended 2021 only 0.1% shy of its pre-Covid-19 level, compared with a previous estimate of 0.4%. However, increased government spending has made up much of the shortfall, and growth remains well off the trend that would have been expected before the pandemic began. The government ordered a surge of coronavirus testing and a huge programme of booster vaccine shots at the end of November as the Omicron variant spread. That in turn required a large rise in government spending, which sustained economic output. The pandemic lockdowns caused the biggest economic recession since comparable records began, followed by the fastest annual economic growth since the second world war in 2021. The huge volatility in output has caused the UK’s statisticians difficulties in measuring the economy, and the ONS has warned of larger than usual revisions. On Thursday it said the 2020 recession was slightly less severe than expected, with a decline of 9.3%, meaning the recovery through 2021 was slightly smaller, at 7.4%. The data showed that household consumption is now 1.1% below its pre-coronavirus level, after a downward revision that comes as consumers face rising prices of energy and basic goods that have prompted a cost of living crisis. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy, said the spending revision “suggests the squeeze on real incomes is starting to bite, although the fall in the saving rate is providing a cushion. “The 0.1% quarter-on-quarter fall in real household disposable incomes was smaller than we had expected. But it was the third decline in as many quarters and the big increases in prices that lie ahead means further falls are on their way.” Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, another consultancy, highlighted that output excluding government spending remained 2.9% short of the pre-pandemic high. “Exports were a hefty 15.7% below their 2019 fourth quarter level – the worst performance in the G7, by some distance – greatly exceeding the 6.4% shortfall in imports,” he said. “Exports have consistently underperformed relative to other advanced economies since the first quarter of 2021, suggesting that Brexit is largely to blame.”",News/Business,"UK economy growing faster than thought, ONS says",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/31/uk-economy-growing-faster-than-thought-ons-says
3/31/2022,"Solomon Islands has announced it is pushing ahead with a security agreement with China hours after a senior Australian defence force officer said the deal may force Canberra to change the way it conducts air and sea operations in the Pacific. The Solomon Islands government said officials from both countries had on Thursday “initialled” elements of the proposed security agreement with China which would be signed at a later date. “The draft framework agreement will be cleaned up and await signatures of the two countries’ foreign ministers,” said the statement issued by the Solomon Islands government’s communication unit. Australia, New Zealand and the US have all raised concerns about the deal but Solomon Islands said it would continue to uphold its foreign policy of “friends to all and enemies to none”. The government said it would “work with all partners in providing a safe and secure nation where all people are able to co-exist peacefully”. The statement was issued after Lt Gen Greg Bilton, Australia’s chief of joint operations, said it “does change the calculus if Chinese navy vessels are operating from Solomon Islands”. Bilton was asked about the implications for Australian defence planners if the deal paved the way for temporary stationing of Chinese naval vessels in Solomon Islands. “They’re in much closer proximity to the Australian mainland, obviously, and that would change the way that we would undertake day‑to‑day operations particularly in the air and at sea,” Bilton told reporters in Canberra. “We would change our patrolling patterns and our maritime awareness activities.” Bilton said “a very important aspect” of Australia’s relationship with Solomon Islands had been to provide training to the country’s police force. “Our training will continue,” he said. “So I guess we find ourselves in a circumstance where we will be present in the Solomon Islands and so too will the Chinese, seeking to provide training and support to the same organisations.” The prime minister of Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, earlier this week dismissed foreign criticism of the country’s security negotiations with Beijing as “insulting” and blamed the leak of the draft document on “some lunatics and agents of foreign regimes in the government system”. The draft, which emerged online last week, said Solomon Islands may request China to send police, armed police, military personnel and other law enforcement and armed forces to the country for a range of tasks such as maintaining social order and protecting lives and property. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning According to the draft text, the agreement would also pave the way for China to “make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands” while Chinese forces “can be used to protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in Solomon Islands”. However, it is unclear whether there will be any minor or substantial changes when the agreement is ultimately signed. Solomon Islands sought to thank its traditional partners in Thursday’s statement. “Solomon Islands seeks greater security partnership with other partners and neighbours and once again express its deep gratitude and sincere appreciation to Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and Fiji for the presence of their Security Personnel in Solomon Islands,” it said. “We thank their respective governments and peoples for the service of their professionals whom we welcome and acknowledge with a thankful heart.” The president of the Federated States of Micronesia, David Panuelo, had also urged Solomon Islands to reconsider the “unprecedented” security pact with China. “My fear is that we – the Pacific islands – would be at the epicentre of a future confrontation between these major powers,” Panuelo wrote in a letter released on Thursday. In Senate estimates hearings in Canberra on Thursday, Australian officials said they were aware of discussions “for some time” but would not be more specific about when they first learned of the draft deal. Officials confirmed that the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, had had “direct contact” with Sogavare, but this was not in the form of a telephone conversation. The finance minister, Simon Birmingham, rejected claims the deal was a failure of Australian diplomacy. “I do not accept that,” Birmingham told senators. “Are you suggesting that a better form of diplomacy would be to hector and lecture” Solomon Islands not to take the deal? A former senior Australian intelligence official had warned that the proposed treaty was an “adverse development for Australia’s security” and would also have wider implications for Pacific stability, but predicted it may be too late to stop the deal. Richard Maude, head of the Office of National Assessments from 2013 to 2016 and an experienced former diplomat, said the agreement “could spark responses from other countries, including Australia, leading to a more crowded Pacific in a military sense”. China’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that countries should “earnestly respect Solomon Islands’ sovereignty and its independent decisions instead of deciding what others should and should not do in a condescending manner”.",News/World news,"Security agreement with China ‘initialled’ by both countries, Solomon Islands says ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/security-agreement-with-china-initialled-by-both-countries-solomon-islands-says
3/31/2022,"Barely an hour into Elden Ring, the latest furiously difficult fantasy adventure by the Japanese studio From Software, I made a vital discovery: enemy warriors can be tricked into falling down lift shafts. Or off cliffs. I even managed to tempt one skilled and deadly knight to walk out of his castle and into the path of a giant boulder – a trap that had been meant for me. It killed him instantly, saving me an intense battle that would have probably involved multiple deaths and restarts. I knew that I had crossed an important, almost forbidden Rubicon – I was now cheesing one of the most critically acclaimed games of the year. Cheesing is video-game slang for beating tasks or enemies through tactics that while not exactly cheating, are certainly not following Queensbury rules. When you cheese a game, you’re exploiting systemic quirks or apparent design oversights to gain maximum advantage for minimum skill or effort. Players have always cheesed. It’s something I discovered via the 1985 fighting game Way of the Exploding Fist, in which every single one of the enemy fighters could be beaten by continuously using the leg sweep move. Later, Street Fighter II became notorious for its vulnerability to cheese aficionados. These ignoble warriors would invariably play as Blanka, whose electrification move afforded vital seconds of invulnerability. Recently, I tweeted a request for people’s favourite memories of their own cheesy video-game victories, and the replies were an absolute delight. From kicking enemy soldiers off battlements in Assassin’s Creed to pummelling bosses just as they appear on screen in Streets of Rage, to standing in exactly the right spot in Zelda 2, respondents delighted in beating computer-controlled enemies in ways the designers probably hadn’t conceived. The most popular response, however, was from Andrew Brazier, who wrote: “In Rollercoaster Tycoon on the mission where you had to have a more popular park than the one next door – I built a rollercoaster that launched riders over the boundary fence to their death. The fatalities get recorded on the other park’s stats, so their popularity bombs.” The tweet garnered more than 300 likes. Evidently people admired its combination of ingenious thinking and extreme violence. But is cheesing inherently wrong? Is it bad? I don’t think it is – it’s just a more abstract and tangental approach to victory. The writer and philosopher Edward de Bono defined lateral thinking as “breaking out of the concept prison of old ideas”, and this is kind of what cheesing is about – it challenges accepted concepts of gameplay and game skill. Lateral thinking during conflict is something we have begrudgingly admired throughout history, from the Trojan horse, through machiavellian political philosophy, to today’s sports stars. One of the most celebrated victories in tennis history was when young pretender Michael Chang beat superstar Ivan Lendl at the French Open in 1989 through literally underhand tactics. Cheesing represents an interesting dichotomy between two types of video-game consumers: “game players”, who see the experience in abstract terms, as a puzzle to be defeated through any affordance available, and “role players” who seek to inhabit the character and the universe, and exist within its narrative constraints. Neither of those is wrong per se, they’re just coming at the idea of victory from different perspectives. There are, however, gradients on the cheesing scale. For example, standing in an area that a computer-controlled enemy can’t legitimately get to is one thing, but taking advantage of an enemy getting helplessly stuck in the scenery due to a character model glitch is quite another. I mean, I’m not above this – it’s how I defeated most of the boss battles in Cyberpunk 2077 – but it feels more like cynical exploitation rather than gaming the system. Replying to my tweet on cheesing, the games journalist Jason Schreier cheerfully admitted to beating one of the toughest bosses in the co-op online shooter Destiny by yanking out his LAN cable at a vital moment, thereby taking advantage of an error in the game’s net code. Look, as a race, human beings are designed to seek, understand and exploit patterns and systems: nobody ever killed a sabre-toothed predator while playing by its rules. There is a peculiar pleasure in beating a system in a way that the system didn’t expect; it reminds us that we are individuals and that we have agency. Sure, when I beat Elden Ring’s awesomely powerful Tree Sentinel by hiding in the alcove of a church and repeatedly poking him with a spear, I didn’t walk away feeling glorious (it would not have made a great ending to a Homerian epic or Hollywood action flick). But I did walk away, which is more than could be said for the Tree Sentinel. There is a vital lesson here, which goes beyond gaming. The victories that you celebrate with a wry smile are often more lasting and meaningful than the ones accompanied by a fist pump and a yell. If the system is set up against you, every quiet disobedience is a triumph. To slightly misquote Katharine Hamnett’s 1983 T-shirt slogan: cheese life.",Arts/Games,Is it wrong to cheese a video game?,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/mar/31/is-it-wrong-to-cheese-a-video-game
3/31/2022,"In May 1907, to the great excitement of the British tabloid press, the Fifth Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour party met at the Brotherhood church in Hackney, east London. Among the delegates were Lenin, Trotsky, Litvinov, Rosa Luxemburg, the writer Maxim Gorky, at least two spies from the Russian secret police and a 29-year-old shoemaker’s son from Georgia who went by the nom de revolution of Koba. The original Koba had been a Georgian folk hero in the Robin Hood mould, an outlaw who defended the weak against the strong. History would remember his namesake by a later pseudonym, a play on the Russian word for steel: Stalin. Stalin spent about three weeks in London, lodging first and very briefly at Tower House, a notoriously grim doss house in Stepney, and then, at his insistence, in rather less squalid private accommodation nearby. In Sell Us the Rope, Stephen May weaves real-life events with fictional imaginings to create a novel that defies easy categorisation: a convincing slice of history that is also a darkly comic tale of political intrigue and a revealing portrait of the dictator who would go on to mastermind the Great Terror of the 1930s, the bloodiest and most brutal campaign of political repression in Russian history. What kind of man becomes a monster? From the moment of his disembarkation on to the drizzly Harwich quay, May’s Koba is uncompromising, suspicious of charm, a short man with a short fuse and the instinct towards violence that comes from having been brutally beaten as a child. He dislikes his companions, whom he regards as patronising and overprivileged. He dislikes England more, and not just because of the filth and the fog and the foul food. In England, with his poor English, he is as he has always been in Russia: an outsider. On the first day of the congress, a motion is tabled to have the Georgian delegation excluded from proceedings. An intervention by Lenin allows them to remain in a non-voting capacity, but the message is clear: all communists are not equal. May’s Koba understands this. He also understands that silence can be a useful weapon. Koba is a listener, a man who notices everything: “He hasn’t written poetry for years, but he tries to retain a poet’s eye.” A torturer’s eye too, perhaps. Adept at identifying weakness, Koba is a grandmaster in the pitiless chess game of revolutionary politics. But though he lacks scruples, he is not a monster, not entirely, not yet. There is softness still inside his hardened shell. He is protective of nervy young Arthur Bacon, London errand boy and racketeer-in-training, who, like Koba at his age, is battered by his alcoholic father. He tips too much. He admires – and is increasingly attracted to – Elli Vuokko, a dauntless young lathe operator from Finland who does nothing to stroke his ego. Pragmatic about the business of bloodshed, he is nonetheless troubled by ghosts. “The living come and go, but the dead never leave you,” he tells Elli. “Everyone you kill hangs around, plucking at your sleeve, wanted to be acknowledged, refusing to be forgotten.” Already one can sense them, the millions of ghosts to come, stirring in the margins. In an afterword, May acknowledges that some parts of his story are invented. He makes no apology for this. “Fiction,” he says, quoting Laurent Binet, “respects nothing.” The same might be said for the engaging (and fictional) Elli. Clear-sighted, courageous and irresistibly quick to laughter, she is at least as excited by her new friendship with Rosa Luxemburg as she is by the possibility of a love affair with Koba. By pairing their stories, May shines a light on the contradictions in communist ideology itself: the righteous ferocity of its convictions and the ugly violence of its methods. The idealistic Elli is as unflinching as Koba in her certainty that “free nations can only evolve out of streams of blood”. Other historical inventions feel more problematic. In May’s telling, Koba has murdered his brute of a father: he cannot shake his ghost, either in his waking hours or in his dreams. While this lends the narrative an undeniably Shakespearean echo, the rather more prosaic truth is that Stalin’s father died of cirrhosis two years after the London congress. By rooting his Koba in so fundamental a fiction, May plants a niggling worm of doubt about the integrity of his creation. Cavils aside, this remains a deeply satisfying novel. Incisive, inventive, frequently very funny, Sell Us the Rope pulls off something rare and exhilarating: it takes a powerful piece of political history and a sober meditation on the nature of evil, and mashes it up with a pacy plot to create a story that is as propulsive as it is thought-provoking. Fiction may respect nothing, but a novel as skilful as this one commands a great deal of it.  Sell Us the Rope by Stephen May is published by Sandstone (£8.99).

3/31/2022,"The Greens are mounting a last-ditch effort to stop the New South Wales government passing a controversial bill which would see protesters who block major roads, ports or train stations face up to two years in prison, by moving dozens of amendments in a late-night sitting session. The filibuster attempt comes after the government sought to force the hastily drafted bill through both houses of parliament in less than 48 hours. The legislation introduces fines of up to $22,000 and up to two years in jail for anyone who “enters, remains on, climbs, jumps from or otherwise trespasses” major roads or other transport assets and “seriously disrupts or obstructs vehicles or pedestrians”. The bill prompted immediate alarm from a swathe of groups including unions, human rights organisations and environmentalists. On Thursday, the Rev Tim Costello urged the government to reconsider the bill, saying it “does not get the balance right” between the right to peaceful protest and “reckless behaviour”. “Many charities are concerned that their capacity to call out governments doing the wrong thing will be impeded if they cannot protest, or if any assembly of people can be prosecuted and incur severe penalties including jail time because they are blocking a road,” Costello said. “We urge the government to reconsider this legislation to ensure peaceful protests can still take place.” Kieran Pender, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, also questioned if the bill was constitutional, saying it potentially infringed on the implied right to political communication. “The high court has recognised that the freedom of political communication, including to protest, is an essential component of Australian democracy,” he said. “There are serious questions about the lawfulness of these proposed changes. We know that other disproportionate and excessive anti-protest measures have been struck down by the court.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Coalition was able to rush the bill through the state’s lower house on Wednesday night with the support of the Labor opposition, after it agreed to add carve-outs which exempted industrial action. But the Greens said those protections were insufficient, pointing out that other protests – including for climate action – would not be protected. The Greens MP Abigail Boyd told the Guardian the bill had been drafted to “stifle dissent among the people of NSW”. “This is a government scared of being called out for its failures, uncomfortable with voices of dissent. The Greens intend to force this government to hear some of these dissenting voices tonight. “This is a legislative agenda cooked up in the 2GB studios.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app The Guardian understands that, despite both major parties’ support for the bill, the Greens and the Animal Justice party will attempt to move about 60 amendments in a bid to delay the bill’s passage on Thursday night. The government introduced the legislation in response to a series of climate protests which caused disruptions across Sydney in recent weeks, including blockades of Port Botany and the Spit Bridge in the city’s north. The government last week announced a crackdown on those protests, including the establishment of a police strikeforce, after criticism from some media. On Wednesday night, the independent MP for Sydney, Alex Greenwich, called the bill a response to “shock jocks and tabloid newspapers”. “We are dealing with this bill because political leaders gave quick grabs at press conferences that they are trying to back up,” he said. “Tonight is NSW parliament at its worst.

3/31/2022,"David and Victoria Beckham’s west London mansion has been broken into while the couple were at home, with “thousands of pounds” worth of items stolen. The burglary of the couple’s £40m Kensington home is believed to have occurred late in the evening of 28 February, while they were at home with their 10-year-old daughter, the Sun reported. The break-in was not discovered until the couple’s son, Cruz Beckham, 17, returned home from a night out and found a broken window in a spare bedroom that had been “ransacked”. The family are said to have searched for the burglar, who had left the building by that point. A Metropolitan police spokesperson confirmed officers responded to reports of a burglary at a residential address in the W11 area of Kensington at 12.37am on 1 March. The burglary was believed to have taken place , between 8.30pm and 11.30pm. They added that a number of items were reported stolen. No arrests have been made and inquiries are continuing. According to the Sun, the missing items included “thousands of pounds of designer and electric goods”. The newspaper suggested that the burglar may have been a highly professional “cat burglar” who used their athletic ability to clamber over the gate and shimmy up a drain pipe before breaking the window of one of the home’s six bedrooms. David, a former England footballer, and Victoria, a fashion designer, are said to be “shaken” to the extent that they have ordered a review of the London mansion’s security. The Beckhams’ neighbourhood, in Holland Park, is known for its density of high-value lavish properties, leading to the nickname “millionaires’ row”.
