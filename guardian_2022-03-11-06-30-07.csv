3/11/2022,"I’m loth to kink-shame, but I’m not sure I can get behind consensual cannibalism. Conflicted Theatre’s unnerving comedy is inspired by the 2001 case of Armin Meiwes, who killed and ate a man he found online. Crucially, the man on the menu agreed to the whole affair. Featuring a present-day copycat version of Meiwes’s fantasy, this disturbing two-hander is surprisingly funny, laced with an edge of something metallic. This weekend-long date between ready-to-eat Sam (Pedro Leandro) and unashamed cannibal Nick (Eddie Loodmer-Elliott) takes place in a makeshift kitchen with a backdrop of murder-scene plastic. Written by both actors with director Evan Lordan, there is a lightness to the dialogue, their natural first-date chatter moving seamlessly between the best way to cook a carbonara and how to sauté a human thigh. References to flavour recur in Nick’s speech, as if his desire for human meat is an indicator of the very finest of tastes. For something so provocative, this human flesh dinner date is surprisingly gentle. Leandro in particular is magnetic, his affable humour side-by-side with his intense vulnerability. But for this play to really work, it has to convince us, however briefly, that what they’re doing is the right thing for them. The closest we come to believing is when Sam learns he’s not the first to have gotten this far, and is heartbroken at not being special; we finally get a glimpse of what this horrific event means to him. It’s a shame the moments of raw openness are over-reliant on the ready-made 36 questions to fall in love, which do a lot of the writers’ jobs for them. There’s an interesting absence of sex, as the play suggests the men’s desire to be bonded by flesh goes far beyond any fetish, but this isn’t explored deeply enough before the offhand humour returns. The constant downplaying of the situation is what gives the play its vibrant comedy, but it also serves as a barrier to true understanding. As such, the show can’t persuade us that Nick isn’t ultimately psychopathic, and that Sam wouldn’t benefit from several rounds of therapy. Without a nugget of belief in the final action, the attempt for transcendence just ends up feeling desperately sad.

3/11/2022,"The US believes North Korea is testing a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in what the Biden administration called a “serious escalation” that will trigger more sanctions. Pyongyang conducted two recent missile launches which it said were ultimately intended for putting satellites into space. After scrutinising them, however, US intelligence has assessed that the real intention was to test parts of the new ICBM. “After careful analysis, the US government has concluded the DPRK’s [North Korea’s] two ballistic missile tests on February 26, and March 4 of this year, involved a relatively new intercontinental ballistic missile system that the DPRK is developing,” a senior administration official said. “This is a serious escalation by the DPRK.” The US believes the ICBM being tested was first displayed by the Pyongyang regime in the Workers’ party parade on 10 October 2020, and then again at a defence exhibition a year later. The administration official said it was so far impossible to determine the eventual power and range of the new ICBM as so far, only parts of it are being tested, but did not say what specific components the US thought were being tested. “These launches are likely intended to test elements of this new system before the DPRK conducts a launch at full range, which they will potentially attempt to disguise as a space launch,” the official said. The US made its assessment in conjunction with Japan and South Korea, the official added, and would share the conclusions with other allies and partners, including the United Nations. US forces have stepped up their monitoring and intelligence collection in the region, and new sanctions are to be introduced on Friday aimed at further restricting North Korea’s access to advanced technology that it could use in its weapons programmes. “There will be a range of further actions in the coming days,” the US official said. The White House says that Joe Biden is open to diplomacy and would be prepared to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, “when there is a serious agreement on the table”. The Biden administration believes any such agreement would need to be preceded by working-level negotiations, as the experience of Donald Trump’s meetings with Kim suggested that “summits alone are no guarantee of progress,” the senior official said, adding: “The DPRK continues to not respond. “While the door remains open to diplomacy, the United States will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland and our allies,” the official said. North Korea conducted three ICBM tests in 2017, and has carried out a total of six nuclear tests, before suspending both types of testing before the summits with Trump. In January, Pyongyang said it would reconsider “restarting all temporarily suspended activities”, and analysts have seen signs of construction at North Korea’s Punggye-ri nuclear test site for the first time since its closure and dismantlement in the spring of 2018.",News/World news,‘Serious escalation’: US believes North Korea testing intercontinental missile,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/us-north-korea-icbm-missile-serious-escalation

3/11/2022,"The 2020 US census undercounted America’s Latino population at more than three times the rate of the 2010 census, according to a report released on Thursday by the US Census Bureau. The census also undercounted the nation’s Black and Native American residents, while overcounting non-Hispanic white people and Asian Americans. The census helps guide the annual federal distribution of $1.5tn for public services including education, healthcare and transportation. Undercounting communities results in reduced political representation on local, state and federal level. According to the report, Latinos had a net undercount of nearly 5%. The Black population had a net undercount of 3.3%, a slight increase from a 2.1% shortfall a decade ago. American Indian and Alaska Natives living on reservations had a net undercount of 5.6%, up from 4.9% in the last census. The non-Latino white population had a net overcount in the 2020 census of 1.6% while Asians had a net overcount of 2.6%. In comparison, the non-Latino white population had a net overcount of 0.8% in 2010 while Asians had a net undercount of 0.08% that year. Overall, the 2020 census overlooked 0.24% of the total US population. In 2010, the census missed 0.01% of the national population. During a webinar on Thursday, the Census Bureau director, Robert Santos, said numerous factors played a role in the undercount of the Latino community, including the pandemic and increased joblessness and housing insecurity. “I’m personally not surprised to see the results we see today,” he said. Arturo Vargas, CEO of NALEO Educational Fund, expressed concerns about the undercount during the conference, saying that throughout his 35 years of tracking the census, he had never seen such a significant undercount in the Latino population. “As you can imagine, we are just terribly – I can’t even find the word right now – upset about the extent of the Latino undercount,” Vargas said. “These numbers are devastating. Once again, we see an overcount of white Americans and an undercount of Black and Hispanic Americans,” the National Urban League CEO, Marc Morial, told reporters on a phone call. “I want to express in the strongest possible terms our outrage.” The report cited various factors that influenced the undercounts, stating, “The 2020 Census faced many challenges, such as conducting fieldwork during the Covid-19 pandemic. Other challenges … included controversy around a proposed citizenship question, and changes in the duration of the Nonresponse Followup and other operations.” In 2019, the Donald Trump administration proposed adding a question to the 2020 census which would ask: “Is this person a citizen of the United States?” The proposal, which eventually failed, led to concerns that many Latinos and immigrants would not return their census forms out of fear that their responses could be used against them. Despite the undercount, the bureau said that the results are “fit to use” for redistricting and are of “high quality”. “In fact, the quality of the 2020 census data is quite remarkable amid all the challenges we faced last year,” the bureau said.",News/US news,US census produced huge undercount of Latino population in 2020 ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/10/us-2020-census-huge-undercount-latino-population
3/11/2022,"It must have been a bracing morning call at Stamford Bridge, with the news that Roman Abramovich is now considered so toxic that the government has slapped him with sanctions after 19 years in which he has been garlanded as the Chelsea benefactor. For the UK, the Premier League, for football – for all of us – it would feel a little better if we could say this has come as a terrible shock, that nobody has known enough about Abramovich all these years. But sadly that kind of reassurance would be just more self-delusion, and the times we are in surely demand a bit of straight talking. Of course it was stunning to see the government actually freeze Abramovich’s assets, overthrowing his and Chelsea’s complacency with one closely typed paragraph damning his closeness to Vladimir Putin. But really the shock was mostly of recognition, pointing past the emperor’s clothes – and trophies, in Abramovich’s case – to some naked truths in plain sight all along. The court proceedings referred to by the Home Office, in that document Chris Bryant read out to such dramatic effect in the Commons two weeks ago, took place in 2012. By 2019, after the novichok poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the everyday English city of Salisbury, the government took the view: “Abramovich remains of interest to HMG [Her Majesty’s Government] due to his links to the Russian state and his public association with corrupt activity and practices … An example of this is Abramovich admitting in court proceedings that he paid for political influence.” The court judgment by Mrs Justice Gloster stated that it was Abramovich’s own case that the political lobbying activities of his former oligarch partner, Boris Berezovsky, providing him with political krysha (protection) were: “Inherently corrupt, and that likewise, the deal between the two men, whereby Mr Abramovich agreed to pay Mr Berezovsky for his krysha services, was also corrupt.” The judgment also noted that Abramovich had “very good relations” with Putin, including “privileged access” to the Russian president. How the money was made was known and well-reported by 2003 when Abramovich bought Chelsea, and the club’s successes have been funded with his oligarch money. Players were bought in waves as never before, and he bankrolled transfer fees and wages the club could otherwise not have paid. In that way he bought the Premier League, the Champions League and, just days before Putin invaded Ukraine, the Club World Cup. It could also be comforting to lay blame for the reverent indulgence of Abramovich at the doors of just the Premier League, the Football Association or a succession of governments more than happy for Britain to soak up cash from anywhere. But that would be a cop-out too: the facts have been there for anybody who could be bothered to care. There was, though, a wilful obliviousness to the known facts of how he had become an oligarch, and he proceeded to cement his presence and Chelsea’s super-club status while football adjusted to his mega-spending. After it was all laid out in 2012, his representatives said Gloster had not got her assessment quite right. They played down Abramovich’s relationship with Putin, pointing to evidence that he was “not in the inner circle”. Recently, he started even to come on to the pitch to celebrate a trophy. For those who did care, it was painful to see César Azpilicueta, the modern model professional with his work ethic, captain’s armband and side parting, ushering his owner to centre stage with the Champions League trophy at the final last season. The globally broadcast images of Abramovich, with his wide, triumphant smile and his hands on football’s greatest prize, were not a great look for football, for Britain or for Europe. Finally the government has ploughed through all the froth, stating in its reasons for the sanctions that Abramovich is a “pro-Kremlin oligarch” who has had “a close relationship for decades” with Putin, and had “preferential treatment and concessions from Putin and the government of Russia” including contracts in the run-up to the 2018 World Cup. His company could supply steel to the Russian military, which could be used to produce tanks, and could provide money, goods or technology “that could contribute to destabilising Ukraine”. There is a clear challenge for English football, which is important even in this horrifying context, as the glamour and legitimacy it bestows is coveted by all manner of regimes and money men. It must ask whether it does enough to ensure that its irresistible sport and adored clubs are forces for good in the world – because after being captured by cash, its rules have been exposed as laughably inadequate. Even now, its owners and directors test appears to approve Abramovich as “a fit and proper person”. The rules were designed to stop small-time crooks taking over small football clubs, and have never been equipped for the Premier League’s modern age. People are barred if they have a criminal conviction for dishonesty or have been made bankrupt. No, Abramovich doesn’t have any convictions and no, he has never been bankrupt. He became a billionaire in the “wild east” of Russia post-communism, which was not governed by the rule of law. For nearly two decades, he has been allowed to bestride the game, flood it with his money and claim its greatest prizes, and all that has only finally ended because of an actual war.",Sport/Football,Football ignored the truth about Roman Abramovich’s oligarch money for too long | David Conn,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/10/football-ignored-the-truth-about-roman-abramovichs-oligarch-money-for-too-long
