2/25/2022,"As Russia launches a war against Ukraine, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) — down more than 3% at Thursday's open — mounted a furious comeback, with megacap stocks Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) doing much of the heavy lifting. However, the eight largest U.S. publicly traded companies have hemorrhaged over $2 trillion in market capitalization since their combined value peaked in mid-November. According to one Wall Street strategist, the geopolitical maelstrom may give bottom-fishing investors the opportunity to start nibbling at beaten-down stocks. The combined market cap of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta Platforms (FB), Nvidia (NVDA), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) surged 168% from the pandemic low — from $4.3 trillion to a peak of $11.7 trillion on Nov. 19. Shortly thereafter, Apple would briefly top $3 trillion in value — but tantalizingly, it was never able to settle over that milestone valuation. As inflation picked up sharply in the fourth quarter, U.S. Treasury yields across the curve (^FVX, ^TNX, ^TYX) surged higher. However, the shorter maturities gained more quickly than the long end — flattening the yield curve. In early January, investors woke up to the most hawkish Federal Reserve in 40 years, along with economic data rolling in on the toll the Omicron variant was taking on spending and the labor market, as vast swaths of workers called in sick for weeks. This set the stage for the messy year investors have faced so far — with pricey growth companies and financial stocks flagging as the yield curve flattens. In the S&P 500 (^GSPC), only the energy sector has advanced this year — up over 20%. That's as WTI crude oil (CL=F) finally hit north of $100/bbl — for the first time since mid-2014. This year alone, the average megacap stock is returning a loss of 17.6%, with Meta leading the way down — off 41.0% — thanks to a major earnings disappointment. But even Alphabet, which popped 7.5% after a big earnings beat, is down 12% this year. Tesla and Nvidia are each off by more than 20%. Yet despite the carnage, investors are on the lookout for signs of selling capitulation to mark a potential bottom. DailyFX.com Senior Strategist Christopher Vecchio joined Yahoo Finance Live early Thursday as the Nasdaq opened down nearly 3.5%. To help find signs of a bottom, Vecchio said investors should look to see elevated fear levels in the market as expressed by the CBOE Volatility Index (^VIX) and the CBOE VVIX Index (^VVIX). ""During other market sell-off episodes, two things have popped out that suggest we're nearing an exhaustion point. That would be [the] VIX above 35, and VVIX — the volatility of the volatility index — moving above 150. We didn't see that yesterday. It's likely that we're going to see that today,"" said Vecchio. By midday Thursday, the VIX had peaked at nearly 38, and the VVIX had topped out at 145. Vecchio is also looking at some of the broader index levels falling into territory not seen since last year — giving some confidence to dip a toe in the investing waters again on a short-term basis. ""Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are coming into some technically significant levels — really going back to the May 2021 lows. And I do think that at that point in time, given the specter of this sell-off, it becomes sensible from a risk-reward standpoint — at least try to cherry pick a short-term bottom,"" he said. EvercoreISI tech analyst Mark Mahaney shared a similar sentiment on Yahoo Finance Live Thursday, arguing that it makes sense to buy quality names at these levels — like Amazon and Google — if one's investment time frame is longer. ""If you have a 9 to 12 month outlook, you will be able to start off buying the highest quality names,"" said Mahaney. Vecchio stresses that Russia is only a catalyst against the backdrop of several larger market themes. ""This all ties back to what's happening with the Fed in March. Russia is an accelerant here, but the conditions are in place for weaker stocks. You have a decline in corporate earnings, a weaker growth environment and of course record high inflation."" Analysts have been quick to point out that the Fed is less likely to front-load the monetary tightening process against the new geopolitical backdrop. Vecchio believes the Fed will hike its benchmark rate in March by only 25 basis points instead of 50 bps — regardless of the final inflation numbers that are released before the meeting. ""[U]ltimately given the scale of the decline we've seen thus far — looking into those May 2021 lows — it is a stopping point for further bleeding,"" said Vecchio, referring to the price action in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq early Thursday.

2/25/2022,"Bitcoin enthusiasts have long touted the cryptocurrency’s value as a safe haven to hedge against inflation and other risks in traditional markets. But hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine on Thursday, cryptocurrencies plummeted. Bitcoin—the digital asset most often referred to as an alternative to gold—plunged 8% within hours of Russia invading Ukraine, with prices tanking to $34,413 per coin. Ether, the native currency of the game-building blockchain Ethereum, has crashed 7% to $2,404 per unit. Ethereum rival Solana, which is popular among NFT creators, tanked 10% to $83, too. Even Shiba Inu, a meme coin which enjoyed logic-defying 49,000,000% growth last year, sank 10%. According to market tracker CoinMarketCap, the total crypto market lost $160 billion of value in the past 24 hours, plunging 10% since the Ukraine invasion began. Of course, crypto isn’t the only asset that has tanked on news of Russia’s invasion, or even in the buildup to the event. Europe’s benchmark Stoxx 600 index dropped 2% after opening Thursday, while analysts expect the S&P 500 index will trim 7% in weeks to come. But the fact that crypto is falling in lockstep with other assets is counter to Bitcoin’s identity as a safe haven. Over the past year, as more institutional investors piled onto the cryptocurrency bandwagon, the value of Bitcoin and its peers have tracked traditional markets more closely—falling when regular stocks tumble and gaining on broader bullish sentiment. “The correlation between crypto and stocks has been high over the last few months on both inflation-related macro news and the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical situation,” Chris Dick, a quantitative trader at crypto market maker B2C2, told CNBC. “This correlation shows that Bitcoin is firmly behaving like a risk asset at the moment—not the safe haven it was touted to be a few years ago.” Some industry leaders in the crypto space recognize Bitcoin’s gradual integration with traditional markets as a fundamental shift in the coin’s value as an asset—albeit a shift they can’t make sense of yet. “We’re probably in a new regime than we’ve been in the last year and a half,” CEO of crypto marketplace FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, tweeted Thursday. “We’ll have to see how things work here.” Other crypto enthusiasts maintain that the “fundamental” values of cryptocurrency haven’t changed and that Thursday’s slump is an opportunity to #buythedip, encouraging investors to pile into cryptocurrencies now that their prices are low. Vikram Subburaj, CEO of India’s Giottus Cryptocurrency Exchange, told Business Today that “the current crisis also presents an opportunity to invest in these assets at a lower price.” Certainly Bitcoin might well make a comeback, as it has in the past. By Thursday evening Hong Kong time, Bitcoin had already pared losses to just a 5% dip on yesterday’s value. But perhaps the most damning indictment of Bitcoin’s value as “digital gold” is that while most asset prices have plunged on news of war, real gold actually went up, hitting a 13-month high Thursday, approaching $2,000 an ounce.
