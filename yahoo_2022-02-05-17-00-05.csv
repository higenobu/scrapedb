2/5/2022,"Meta's recent quarter included $10 billion in losses in the metaverse and its first user decline. Its CEO reportedly told staff Thursday the company faced ""unprecedented"" competition from TikTok. He said Meta should focus on its short-form-video feature Instagram Reels to get out of its rut. After Meta posted brutal fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly told employees to home in on the company's way out: video. Bloomberg reported Zuckerberg addressed staff in a companywide virtual meeting Thursday. He said the company was up against an ""unprecedented level of competition"" from TikTok, an attendee not authorized to speak about the call said. Zuckerberg said in an earnings call Wednesday that Meta would be zeroing in on Instagram Reels, its TikTok-like feature. ""People have a lot of choices for how they want to spend their time, and apps like TikTok are growing very quickly,"" he said. The meeting attendee added that Zuckerberg appeared red-eyed and told staff he might tear up during the meeting, not because of the topics being discussed but because he'd ""scratched his eye,"" Bloomberg reported. Facebook's fourth-quarter earnings showed the company's users shrunk for the first time in its history. It lost roughly 1 million daily active users from the previous quarter. In the Wednesday earnings call, the company also reported losing $10 billion on its investments in the metaverse in 2021. Meta's valuation fell by nearly $240 billion on Thursday, marking the biggest one-day wipeout of value in US stock-market history. Zuckerberg's net worth plummeted by roughly $30 billion. Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2/5/2022,"Mosquito bites are an unfortunate inevitability of summertime — or are they? Scientists recently found that mosquitos are more attracted to some colors than others, which could potentially prove useful to those trying to avoid the itchy bites. The study, which was published Friday, found that after a common type of mosquitos smelled CO2 — the gas humans breathe out — they decided to land on some colored dots but ignored others. ""Imagine you're on a sidewalk and you smell pie crust and cinnamon,"" senior author Jeffrey Riffell, a professor of biology at the University of Washington, said in a press release announcing the study's findings. ""That's probably a sign that there's a bakery nearby, and you might start looking around for it. Here, we started to learn what visual elements that mosquitoes are looking for after smelling their own version of a bakery."" The research team put different colored dots at the bottom of a chamber and sprayed them with CO2. (Without the CO2, mosquitos ignored every dot.) They found that mosquitos were drawn most to red, orange, black, and cyan. They also found that mosquitos ignored green, purple, blue and white. When a researcher inserted their hand into the chamber wearing a green glove, mosquitos ignored it, even when it was sprayed with CO2. Unfortunately, avoiding mosquitoes isn't as easy as choosing the right color of clothes. Human skin emits a vivid red-orange ""signal"" to mosquitoes, the researchers said, making it hard to hide completely. ""I used to say there are three major cues that attract mosquitoes: your breath, your sweat and the temperature of your skin,"" Riffell said. ""We found a fourth cue: the color red, which can not only be found on your clothes, but is also found in everyone's skin. The shade of your skin doesn't matter, we are all giving off a strong red signature."" While the research found that the mosquitoes appeared to prefer certain colors, it did not measure whether wearing colors like green or purple would help stave off the critters. But Riffel said wearing clothes that avoid the most attractive colors ""could"" prove to be another way to reduce bites. The researchers also hope that their findings can help design better repellants, bug traps, and other ways to repel the biting bugs.

2/5/2022,"Rudy Giuliani said if Trump had imposed martial law to stay in power, they would end up behind bars, NYT reported. If Trump had taken that step, Giuliani reportedly told an associate, ""we would all end up in prison."" Trump did not impose martial law but envisioned multiple scenarios in which federal agencies seized voting machines. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani said that if then President Donald Trump had imposed martial law in an effort to overturn the 2020 election results, the former president and many of his aides would have wound up behind bars. That's according to Patrick Byrne, the former head of Overstock, who told The New York Times that Giuliani recently explained to him that he advised Trump against imposing martial law because ""we would all end up in prison."" The Times has previously reported on Giuliani's opposition to instituting martial law. Despite his own endorsement of outlandish conspiracy theories about voter and election fraud, he became alarmed when former national security advisor Michael Flynn and former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell suggested imposing martial law. According to the paper, Flynn, Powell, and Byrne went to the Oval Office on December 18, 2020 and laid out a plan that involved deploying the military to seize voting machines and ballots in key battleground states. Giuliani waited until Flynn and Powell had left the Oval Office and told Trump that their plan would get him impeached, the report said. Giuliani's lawyer did not immediately respond to The Times' request for comment. Trump ultimately heeded Giuliani's advice and did not impose martial law. But he did consider scenarios in which federal agencies like the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense would seize voting machines, the report said. In one case, Trump met with then attorney general William Barr in the Oval Office after the election and asked him to use the Justice Department to take voting machines. But Barr immediately rejected the request. In December, roughly six weeks after Election Day 2020, Trump told Giuliani to ask if the DHS had the legal power to seize voting machines in key battleground states, The Times previously reported. But the department's acting deputy secretary said he didn't have that authority. The House select committee investigating the Capitol riot also recently obtained a draft executive order that directed the Secretary of Defense to ""seize"" voting machines. It's unclear who wrote the draft, and The Times reported that Trump had rejected a request by his outside advisors to use the Pentagon to take control of the machines. Trump ultimately did get impeached a second time after the House of Representatives accused him of inciting the failed insurrection on January 6, 2021. Flynn, meanwhile, repeatedly called on Trump to use the military to stay in power. The same week that he and Powell went to the Oval Office to urge Trump to lay out their proposal, Flynn appeared on the far-right outlet Newsmax and said Trump should deploy the military and hold another election. But those remarks aren't based in reality. Despite Republican claims of fraud and election rigging, nonpartisan officials and election experts confirmed that the 2020 election was the safest and most secure in US history. The president does not have the power to unilaterally cancel, delay, postpone, or change the date of an election, even if he declares martial law. As Business Insider previously reported, that power lies with Congress. Declaring martial law also does not suspend the Constitution, and the military has no role in administering elections. Even if it did, it would not be able to run new elections because the right to vote is not specified in the Constitution or by a federal statute.
