3/19/2022,"The death of a young woman at a privately run hospital could have been prevented, an inquest has concluded. Emma Pring, 29, killed herself while an inpatient at Cygnet hospital in Maidstone in April 2021. She was seen as a risk to herself at the time of her death and had been diagnosed with PTSD and depression, caused by surviving two sexual assaults. She was receiving trauma therapy at the hospital, which the inquest heard she found “extremely difficult”. Caroline Sharp, Pring’s mother, told the inquest in Maidstone that she felt her death had arisen over a “cry for help”, and that she was “a ray of light through her own darkness to her family and friends”. “I’m deeply concerned this was a cry for help, and her death was avoidable,” Sharp said. Pring, who was finding it difficult acquiring a placement for trauma therapy, was admitted at Cygnet after the NHS Kent and Medway Clinical Commissioning Group agreed to fund her stay at the hospital. Sharp told the inquest that she thought it would be a “turning point in her life”. The inquest heard how she found the trauma therapy difficult, and had phoned her mother saying that she “couldn’t cope”. While at the hospital, Pring had self-harmed and was taken to A&E on one occasion, although her mother was not informed. On returning to Cygnet, Pring was placed on 15-minute observations due to her risk level. However, Tom Stonate, the barrister representing Pring’s family, put forward the view that a one-to-one, full-time observation regime could have prevented her death. Dr Daniela Herescu, a consultant psychiatrist at Cygnet, said that other steps, such as giving Pring “anti-ligature” clothing, had been taken. On Friday the inquest jury agreed that one to one observations “could have prevented her death”. It found that her death occurred due to an “insufficient level of observation, and a misjudgement of Emma’s actual risk”. The coroner, Catherine Wood, is also considering whether to issue Prevention of Future Deaths Reports regarding risk assessment and information sharing at Cygnet hospital, and about the lack of national standards in relation to the manufacture of anti-ligature clothing in the UK. Sharp said that she thought her daughter would be receiving the best care “money could offer”. “When Emma was transferred to Cygnet Maidstone on 23 July 2020, I thought that Emma would receive Rolls-Royce care, the best money could offer,” she said. “I hoped it would be a turning point in Emma’s life. Instead, Emma was utterly failed by Cygnet. “The jury’s damning findings vindicate the concerns about Emma’s care we have had all along. She was struggling to cope with the trauma therapy she was being given, and her cries for help – which were getting increasingly desperate – were ignored. It is a tragedy to know that her death was preventable.” Lucy McKay, a spokesperson for INQUEST, said: “Society must do more to respond to trauma and support survivors of sexual assault long before their health reaches crisis point. Mental healthcare providers nationally should reflect on the evidence of this inquest, including the dangerous use of ‘anti-ligature’ clothing in place of adequate risk assessment and observation.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

3/19/2022,"With 62 minutes gone, Leeds trailed Wolves, still spewing after Raúl Jiménez’s sending off left them to play virtually the entire second half with 10 men, by two goals. By the end they had won a breathless game when Luke Ayling lashed home in stoppage time. They had drawn level with two goals in four minutes and, one by one, those in white shirts jumped the advertising hoardings to embrace the away fans going ballistic in the lower bank of the Steve Bull stand. On the sidelines, Leeds’ substitutes spilled into the technical area and Jesse Marsch and his coaching staff on to the pitch. Amid the madness, Bruno Lage’s clipboard, his second-half masterplan shattered, lay on the floor in the away dugout. The manner of the equaliser was nothing short of absurd. Stuart Dallas was on the floor, grounded from a poor challenge by João Moutinho, who was lucky to avoid going the same way as Jiménez, but Leeds nevertheless pushed. Daniel James hit the woodwork when attempting to lob José Sá in the Wolves goal but the hosts failed to eliminate the danger. Romain Saïss’s wild clearance ballooned into the air and the Leeds substitute Sam Greenwood coolly controlled the ball and located Rodrigo, who skittled his shot inside the near post. Three minutes earlier, Jack Harrison had fired in from close range after Ayling smacked a post. When the team sheet was released an hour before kick-off, Leeds supporters would have pointed to the names of Liam Cooper and Kalvin Phillips, the pair back in the squad for the first time since early December. Some fans may still have been digesting the welcome news when, with 21 minutes on the clock, another key player, Patrick Bamford, hobbled off the pitch after attempting to latch on to a through ball. Bamford appeared to overstretch and landed awkwardly. Visibly distraught, he pulled his white Leeds shirt over his face before slumping into a seat in the away dugout. Cooper, the Leeds club captain, attempted to console Bamford, putting an arm round his shoulder but the striker, who had been steadily building fitness after returning from a foot injury, playing the first half in victory over Norwich, remained in tears. The 20-year-old Greenwood arrived in Bamford’s place for his second top-flight appearance. If Leeds were reeling from Bamford’s injury, things went from bad to worse five minutes before the interval when Diego Llorente left the field holding his back and was replaced by Robin Koch. On the brink of the interval Mateusz Klich departed and Charlie Cresswell arrived as a concussion substitute. Wolves, too, were forced into a first-half reshuffle. Rúben Neves tried to shake off an early knock but, a few minutes after returning to the pitch, he was withdrawn and Trincão arrived from the bench. But Wolves were undeterred and one of Trincão’s first acts proved decisive, the winger rattling down the right flank and crossing low for Jonny, who held his run and swept the ball home from inside the box, his finish nestling inside the far pocket of Illan Meslier’s goal. It was a jam-packed first half and a disastrous one from a Leeds perspective, even if Marsch’s side began with plenty of gusto. Rodrigo prodded wide after meeting a James cross, seconds after Adam Forshaw extinguished a promising Wolves attack. Rayan Aït-Nouri did brilliantly at the byline, fooling Llorente but Forshaw scented the danger as Daniel Podence dallied inside the box. Bamford squandered Leeds’ best opening on 11 minutes. James seized on Neves’s abnormally loose touch and Bamford, faced with Conor Coady, bared down on goal but screwed his shot wide. Marsch applauded from the sidelines but the picture quickly changed. Wolves deservedly added a second goal into eight minutes of first-half stoppage time, Trincão firing in a wonderful left-foot strike after a quick free-kick outwitted Leeds. Jiménez was also in the mood but missed a handful of chances. His overhead-kick sailed over Meslier’s crossbar and he got his bearings wrong when he attempted to lob the Leeds goalkeeper after Podence snatched the ball from a ruffled Pascal Struijk. Podence then squared the ball from the left but Jiménez failed to make clean contact and instead Jonny forced Meslier into a fine save. Wolves were in command but when Jiménez, already on a booking, collided with Meslier five minutes into the second half, the referee, Kevin Friend, reached for his cards and the striker was dismissed. It proved a significant flashpoint and caused another lengthy stoppage as both players received treatment. Jiménez raced on to Willy Boly’s high pass and when Cresswell failed to intercept, the striker was faced with Meslier, who had surged out of goal. Plenty of bickering between the benches unravelled on the sidelines but Jiménez, shaking his head, headed down the tunnel prematurely. If Jiménez was in disbelief, one can only wonder how he felt as the remaining, barmy minutes unfolded.",Sport/Football,Leeds pull off thrilling comeback as Ayling grabs victory at Wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/18/leeds-pull-off-thrilling-comeback-as-ayling-grabs-victory-at-wolves
3/19/2022,"A lack of local supporters among the Bridgetown crowd has been a source of lament but those who did pitch up on the third day were treated to a pair of fine centuries from Kraigg Brathwaite and Jermaine Blackwood that left England’s bowlers once again searching for answers on the road. Brathwaite would struggle to make an all-time Barbados XI, such is the rich history of cricket on this island and the talent it has produced over the years. The West Indies captain is not an opener to be underestimated, however, and over the course of nine and a half hours he repelled all-comers, reaching the close unbeaten 109 from 337 balls for what was his 10th Test century and his third against England. By this stage he had lost Blackwood, his No 5, after an uncharacteristically resolute innings of 102 from 215 balls had been ended by the loopy off-spin of Dan Lawrence, lbw offering no shot. It was a bizarre miscalculation and a bonus for England’s weary players. But as their supporters headed off to the Friday night fish fry at Oistins, West Indies were 288 for four from 117 overs in reply to England’s 507 for nine declared, needing 20 more runs to avoid the follow-on. A draw looms on another docile pitch, one that will earn much-needed revenues for the Barbados Cricket Association. But England had a couple of opportunities to break a fourth-wicket partnership of 183 from 68 overs that started out from 101 for three in the morning session and led to some words being exchanged between Blackwood and Ben Stokes after tea, such was the frustration it created. The first of these came when Blackwood was yet to score and struck in front of the stumps by Stokes amid a thundering six-over spell during the second hour. With the naked eye it looked a strong shout – umpire’s call on impact with leg stump at worst – but Stokes dissuaded Root from sending the decision upstairs, only for the subsequent Hawkeye projection to return three reds. The second was a moment of agony for one of England’s two debutants, Saqib Mahmood, who in the 93rd over sent a searing yorker to the base of Blackwood’s stumps on 65, only for replays to show he had overstepped. He was instantly consoled by Stokes who, along with Mason Crane, Tom Curran and Mark Wood in recent times, had also seen his maiden Test wicket scrubbed off for a no-ball. Blackwood, it must be said, played superbly. The Jamaican right-hander has a reputation as a mercurial talent, something furthered by his dismissal on the final day in Antigua. But he got his head down here, offering stout defence and a keen eye for a single. He also laced 11 fours. At 4.57pm local time, as he guided Jack Leach for a single that sealed his third Test century, the celebration was joyous. It was a template that had been set by Brathwaite at the other end. After resuming on 28, with West Indies 71 for one and still 436 runs in arrears, the 29-year-old has batted through four sessions without offering a chance in a way that befits his cool character. Even upon reaching his century – a first on his home ground in Test cricket – he lifted his bat with the air of a man not remotely sated. The reprieves for Blackwood came with a sense of justice for West Indies too, having questioned the earlier removal of their rock from the first Test, Nkrumah Bonner. Given out lbw to Stokes for nine on the field, Bonner reviewed instantly amid a belief there was an inside edge. Both ultra-edge and replays hinted at vindication for the batter, only for the third umpire, Gregory Brathwaite, to decide he did not have conclusive evidence to overturn it. Less debatable was England’s first incision when Sharmah Brooks, Brathwaite’s overnight partner, slapped a long-hop from Leach to backward point on 39 and trudged off bereft. With Leach having enjoyed some sharp turn early on, hopes rose that his deployment at one end, allied with the seamers rotating at the other, might see England chip away at more regular intervals. As it was, Leach was only steady and Root’s seamers toiled. Chris Woakes appears drained of confidence – never more so than after tea when Brathwaite drilled him for two fours off the second new ball – while England’s two newcomers in Mahmood and Matthew Fisher bounded in with good energy but only fleeting threat when the ball offered a smidgeon of reverse for the former. Root has lost his chief point of difference on this tour, too, with Wood now ruled out of the third Test in Grenada – and the Indian Premier League that follows – after the elbow injury in Antigua that now requires an opinion of a specialist back in the UK next week. The slog will have to continue without him.",Sport/Sport,Brathwaite and Blackwood lead recovery to frustrate England,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/18/brathwaite-and-blackwood-lead-recovery-to-frustrate-england
3/19/2022,"Courtney Lawes has branded suggestions Eddie Jones’s job is under threat if England end another disappointing Six Nations campaign with defeat against France on Saturday as “ridiculous”. England have lost their two trips to Paris under Jones and a third defeat against the grand-slam chasing French could condemn them to a second successive fifth-place finish in the championship. Jones survived the inquest into last year’s dismal campaign but a repeat performance will lead to another uncomfortable post-mortem at the Rugby Football Union, less than 18 months before the 2023 World Cup. Despite having grand designs on the title, England have managed victories over just Italy and Wales so far this championship and, excluding the game against the Azzurri, have scored only two tries. Lawes, however, has brushed off the criticism facing Jones and England, who head into the final weekend of the championship already out of the title race for the second year in a row. He said: “The thing is everyone’s complaining nowadays. It doesn’t matter what you do, how good you’ve been or whatever, somebody’s going to find something to complain about. Somebody’s always going to say ‘this person should be doing this, shouldn’t be doing this, should be in the team or shouldn’t be’. At this point it’s so ridiculous that there’s no point in even looking. To be honest, we don’t use it as motivation, no, because there’s no point in even watching it.” While the criticism of Jones is growing louder, he retains the public support of his players. This week Sam Simmonds issued a passionate defence of the head coach and Lawes was similarly glowing, crediting Jones with an upturn in form that has seen him playing a key part on the last two British & Irish Lions tours. “He has been massive for my career and really helped me push towards my potential,” added Lawes. “It’s been massive. I don’t know how many Lions tours I would have got without him and if he hadn’t given me a kick up the arse. Certainly we all dig in for the staff, every member of staff, every person who helps us is important to the team. We essentially want to go out there and play for all the people, including each other, that have helped us to get to this point and who we feel we owe it to, essentially.” The difference between beating France and finishing third, or losing and ending the championship in fifth again, is around £1m in prize money for the RFU and victory would alleviate the pressure on Jones with a three-Test tour of Australia to come this summer. It would also go some way to vindicating Jones’s New England project but of the starting XV only three players – Maro Itoje, Ben Youngs and Jack Nowell – have tasted victory in Paris. “This is a special opportunity for us as a team and individuals so I think we’re going to be ready to go,” said Itoje. “Playing against France is always competitive, but we’re playing for England here. Our motivation is to win and we don’t want to let this game pass us by. Playing for England is a massive honour and there is a responsibility that we do our best each time. “You can’t take these type of moments for granted. You never know when they’re going to come again. The future is not guaranteed, but what we can guarantee is living in the present. As a team and individuals we want to take full advantage of the opportunity.” Discounting matches against Italy, England have managed just two victories in their last 10 away matches in the Six Nations and two years ago at the Stade de France managed to scramble a losing bonus point only at the death. Jamie George this week acknowledged the need to silence the French crowd and Itoje added: “They’re loud. They’re noisy. They love to support their team, especially when they’re doing well. They perhaps go a little bit quiet when things aren’t going their way. But when their team is on top and they have momentum, they’re amongst the loudest fans on the circuit.”",Sport/Sport,‘Ridiculous’: Lawes swats aside talk of Jones’s England job being on the line,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/18/ridiculous-courtney-lawes-eddie-jones-england-job-france
3/19/2022,"The family of the British-Iranian detainee Anoosheh Ashoori had to scramble at the last minute to raise £27,000 to pay a fine to the Iranian government, delivering the money in cash to the authorities in Tehran’s Evin prison for it to be counted and authenticated. The Iranian government told British Foreign Office negotiators late on Monday that his release would be blocked unless the fine, linked to his 10-year jail sentence, was paid the following day. Ashooori was released along with Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe on Wednesday after the UK paid Iran a longstanding £400m debt. Iranian authorities arrested Ashoori in August 2017, when he was visiting his mother. In August 2019, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison – 10 years for allegedly “spying for Israel’s Mossad” and two years for “acquiring illegitimate wealth”. Ashoori denied both charges. Ashoori’s wife, Sherry Izadi, told the Guardian: “We had less than 12 hours to raise the money, taking out loans using our credit cards, and opening new accounts. My only thought was: ‘How are we going to do this in time?’” She added: “At first the government officials in Tehran demanded my nephew meet them outside the prison with a suitcase full of cash, but he demanded he went inside the prison and be given a receipt. They kept dragging it out, demanding to count the money and check whether it was counterfeit.” She also revealed that when she spoke to her husband in prison by phone on Monday she had been sworn to secrecy by the Foreign Office and was unable to tell him that a negotiating team was in Tehran finalising his release. He had been told that he was about to be conditionally released, but he did not believe it until he was on a plane since similar promises had been made before. “I could not tell him what I knew since I was told lives were at risk,” she said. Elika Ashoori, the daughter of Anoosheh Ashoori, said they struggled to draw attention to her father’s plight because the UK media did not see the family as “very relatable”. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Elika Ashoori said the family had experienced an “outpouring of love” since her father’s return but the last five years of his captivity had been very different and they had to fight for help. She said: “It has been a very big struggle trying to get my dad’s name out there; we were slightly more successful in the last year of our campaign because of the efforts of Amnesty and other organisations that finally joined us. “But because of his name, age, his looks, us being grownup children, and us not being very relatable so we couldn’t really engage on a major scale with the media and public no matter how hard we tried.” The family, not wealthy, are planning a crowdfunding website to help them pay back the £27,000 debt. In Tehran conflicting reports emerged about the fate of Morad Tahbaz, the British, American and Iranian citizen who the UK was unable to persuade Iran to release along with Ashoori and Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Distressed members of the Tabhaz family claimed he had been taken back to Evin prison after only 48 hours on furlough at his family home in Tehran. But the UK Foreign Office said it had been assured by the Iranian government that he had gone to the prison only to have an ankle tag fitted that should have been installed when he initially left the prison. The Foreign Office said any extended stay back in the prison would be in breach of the undertakings given to the British government that the 69-year-old conservationist was being put on indefinite furlough. It added it was still working with the US to secure his permanent release.",News/World news,"Iran made Ashoori family raise £27,000 in 12 hours to secure his release",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/iran-made-ashoori-family-raise-27000-in-12-hours-to-secure-his-release
