1/17/2022,"A Jewish notary has been named by a cold case team led by a former FBI agent as the prime suspect for the betrayal of Anne Frank and her family to the Nazis. Arnold van den Bergh, who died in 1950, has been accused on the basis of six years of research and an anonymous note received by Anne’s father, Otto Frank, after his return to Amsterdam at the end of the war.  The note claims Van der Bergh, a member of a Jewish council, an administrative body the Germans forced Jews to establish, had given away the Frank family’s hiding place along with other addresses used by those in hiding. He had been motivated by fears for his life and that of his family, it is suggested in a CBS documentary and accompanying book, The Betrayal of Anne Frank by Rosemary Sullivan, based on research gathered by the retired FBI detective Vince Pankoke and his team. Pankoke learned that Van der Bergh had managed to have himself categorised as a non-Jew initially but was then redesignated as being Jewish after a business dispute. It is suggested that Van der Bergh, who acted as notary in the forced sale of works of art to prominent Nazis such as Hermann Göring, used addresses of hiding places as a form of life insurance for his family. Neither he nor his daughter were deported to the Nazi camps. Anne Frank hid for two years in a concealed annex above a canalside warehouse in the Joordan area of Amsterdam before being discovered on 4 August 1944, along with her father, mother, Edith, and sister, Margot. The young diarist was sent to Westerbork transit camp, and on to Auschwitz concentration camp before finally ending up in Bergen-Belsen, where she died in February 1945, at the age of 15, possibly from typhus. Her published diary spans the period in hiding between 1942 and her last entry on 1 August 1944. Despite a series of investigations, the mystery of who led the Nazis to the annex remains unsolved. Otto Frank, who died in 1980, was thought to have a strong suspicion of that person’s identity but he never divulged it in public. Several years after the war, he had told the journalist Friso Endt that the family had been betrayed by someone in the Jewish community. The cold case team discovered that Miep Gies, one of those who helped get the family into the annex, had also let slip during a lecture in America in 1994 that the person who betrayed them had died by 1960. There were two police investigations, in 1947 and 1963, into the circumstances around the betrayal of the Franks. The son of the detective, Arend van Helden, who led the second inquiry, provided a typewritten copy of the anonymous note to the cold case reviewers. The author of the new book, Sullivan, said: “Van der Bergh was a well-known notary, one of six Jewish notaries in Amsterdam at the time. A notary in the Netherlands is more like a very high-profile lawyer. As a notary, he was respected. He was working with a committee to help Jewish refugees, and before the war as they were fleeing Germany. “The anonymous note did not identify Otto Frank. It said ‘your address was betrayed’. So, in fact, what had happened was Van der Bergh was able to get a number of addresses of Jews in hiding. And it was those addresses with no names attached and no guarantee that the Jews were still hiding at those addresses. That’s what he gave over to save his skin, if you want, but to save himself and his family. Personally, I think he is a tragic figure.”",Arts/Books,Anne Frank may have been betrayed by Jewish notary,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/17/anne-frank-betrayed-jewish-notary-book
1/17/2022,"A row over “double jobbing”, which would mean MPs in Westminster also sitting in the Stormont assembly, has erupted in Northern Ireland with accusations the government is trying to prop up the Democratic Unionist party. The proposals, to temporarily restore a practice that was banned in 2016, would allow the DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, to contest the Northern Ireland assembly elections in May while also remaining an MP at Westminster.  On Monday, he confirmed that he planned to stand for the local Lagan Valley seat at Stormont while remaining an MP, a move that could see him eligible to become first or deputy first minister if the DUP succeeded in becoming the biggest or second biggest party. He was pressed on reports that a second DUP MP was also planning to stand for local election but declined to identify the individual, saying the selection process was not yet complete. The double-jobbing proposal has been roundly condemned by all the other parties, with the SDLP MP Claire Hanna telling the BBC on Monday it was “a stroke to benefit Jeffrey Donaldson”. She told Good Morning Ulster that it was impossible to “bilocate” jobs and any attempt to do so would lead to worse government in Northern Ireland. Ulster Unionist party MLA Mike Nesbitt said the plan “reeks of corruption”, claiming Boris Johnson’s government was “going out of its way to prop up and support one party”. Donaldson categorically denied there was any pact with the UK government, telling BBC’s Good Morning Ulster on Monday: “There is no agreement on this between the DUP and the government.” The DUP hit out at what it termed “fake outrage” by political opponents, saying the proposal would bring stability to Northern Ireland “at a time when devolution is deeply unstable because of a one-sided and undemocratic [Brexit] protocol”. Alliance party deputy leader and North Down MP, Stephen Farry, has called on the government to reconsider the plan and said he hoped the House of Lords would vote against the change to the law. He has described the move as a “backwards step” and said there had been a lack of consultation on the issue. “Doing this so close to an election campaign is interfering in the democratic process,” he said. Michelle O’Neill, Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister and vice-president of Sinn Féin, which does not take its seats in Westminster, labelled it as “disgraceful interference in the upcoming assembly election”. The government put forward the proposal in an amendment to the Northern Ireland (ministers, elections and petitions of concern) bill last Wednesday, following a proposal by the Lib Dem peer and former leader of the Alliance party in Northern Ireland Lord Alderdice during the committee stage in the Lords. On Sunday, Farry distanced himself from his predecessor saying Alderdice did not speak for the party and accusing him of “poor judgment”.",News/UK news,Row erupts over plan to allow ‘double jobbing’ in Northern Ireland politics,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/17/row-erupts-over-plan-to-allow-double-jobbing-in-northern-ireland-politics
1/17/2022,"The estate of the late pop singer Prince, including his catalogue of songs, has been valued at $156.4m (£114m), nearly twice an earlier appraisal. The estate’s administrator, Comerica Bank, agreed on the figure with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the heirs to Prince’s estate. The singer died in 2016 without a will, and his estate will pass to three of his siblings as well as the publishing company Primary Wave, who in August 2021 bought out rights to the Prince catalogue from another three heirs, two of them deceased.  The redistribution of the estate’s value could begin next month. “It has been a long six years,” said L Londell McMillan, lawyer for the three heirs, who have faced a costly legal process to have the estate’s value settled and distributed. The process came to a head earlier this month when the IRS, the US tax agency, asserted that the estate was worth $163.2m, twice the $82.3m figure previously submitted by Comerica. The higher valuation meant the IRS would claim substantially more tax. Comerica had sued the IRS in 2020, arguing that there were errors in its valuation. In the wake of the settlement, Comerica argued that is would have prevailed had the case gone to trial, but the heirs had pushed for a settlement to bring the process to a quicker conclusion. Primary Wave and the remaining heirs will now hope to amass new and ongoing revenue from the estate. Prince’s brilliant and far-reaching song catalogue spans funk, R&B, new wave and beyond, and contains pop masterpieces such as Purple Rain, When Doves Cry and 1999. The estate holders can earn income from streaming and sales royalties, as well as placements of Prince songs in film, TV and advertising. The potentially lucrative returns from song catalogues like this have spurred a wave of high-value acquisitions by major labels and publishing companies such as Primary Wave and Hipgnosis, including bodies of work by Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac and Paul Simon.",Arts/Music,Prince estate valued at $156.4m at end of long legal battle,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/17/prince-estate-valued-at-1564m-at-end-of-long-legal-battle
1/17/2022,"The police, crime, sentencing and courts bill that has sparked “kill the bill” demonstrations across the country is a “proportionate” response to recent protests such as those by Insulate Britain, the former justice secretary Robert Buckland has said. Protesters took to the streets in cities across the UK at the weekend to rally against the police and crime bill, which is reaching its final stages in parliament and will be considered by the House of Lords on Monday.  Sections of the bill have been condemned by human rights activists as an attack on the right to protest, with campaigners arguing that, without changes, the right to peaceful protest could be curbed by legislation. Defending the bill and its amendments, Buckland told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he believed some of the characterisation of the new powers was misplaced. “What I see from government is reference to proportionate use of power, and that word is vitally important here,” the Tory MP said. He added that “clearly the engagement of the rights of protesters with the rights of the rest of the public to go about their lawful business is a delicate balance to be struck”. In the light of some recent protests, such as those on the M25 by Insulate Britain protesters, he said, “I think this bill does strike the right balance.” Buckland said it was better to have “delineated powers defined by parliament which allow the police to intervene with the power of arrest to create offences that can be dealt with in the magistrates court that specifically deal with things like gluing yourself to the road or locking yourself on to each other.” But Shami Chakrabarti, the Labour peer and former director of Liberty, told the Today programme that calling the measures “proportionate” contradicted what Amnesty International and other rights groups had said. “Let’s be clear. All of these measures are specifically directed at non-violent protest, making it a criminal offence to breach a condition, a police condition, on a protest whether you knew about it or not,” she said. “That can include shoppers and members of the public who weren’t even part of the protest.” She said the government had, in effect, tabled the equivalent of a new additional bill and dropped it into the police bill, which was what the Lords was to debate today. “That included new offences of attaching yourself, locking on, so vague it could criminalise people with bike locks or who link arms with each other in the street. “Already, and for many years, the police have powers to intervene with obstruction of the highway. They have very broad public order power already, so says Amnesty and everybody else. But under the new measures they would be able to stop and search people without suspicion, not because they feared knife crime or terrorism, but because they fear noise and impact and disruption, which of course is inherent in any peaceful non-violent protest.” The new measures, she said, “give ever broader power to the home secretary and the police to shut down peaceful dissent, voices with which the government does not agree. It’s one law for those with whom the government agrees, and another for everybody else. And these conditions have been compared to Belarus and Russia by Amnesty International.”",News/Law,"‘Kill the bill’ protests: new legislation is proportionate, says Buckland",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/17/kill-the-bill-protests-new-legislation-proportionate-robert-buckland
1/17/2022,"Last year for Martin Luther King Jr Day, I interviewed a group of WNBA players along with Eric Garner’s daughter, Emerald. We spoke about their campaign to unseat Republican Kelly Loeffler, who had been part of the leadership group of the Atlanta Dream, from the US Senate. With the players’ help, the outside candidate Raphael Warnock beat Loeffler giving Democrats control of the Senate. That election in Georgia was an excellent example of how athletes can cause real change. But, as we mark MLK Day on Monday, there are plenty of signs the struggle is far from over. We’ve just passed the first anniversary of the 6 January riots, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol. The subsequent investigation into the riots was a chance to address the extremism that is poisoning US society. But Republicans have attempted to block the inquiry, while politicians and the rightwing media who fanned the flames have not been held accountable.  We have also just watched the sentencing of the three white men who murdered a young Black man, Ahmaud Arbery, in cold blood while he was out jogging. And while justice was eventually served, we should remember that prosecutors failed to act until two months after the killing, when video of the murder was leaked, touching off international outcry. It’s fair to say that America still has a long way to go until it is a safe and just place for all. WNBA players caused real change last year in Georgia and their NBA peers made an impact after the murder of George Floyd in the summer of 2020. John Wall, Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook, Jaylen Brown, Enes Kanter and the Ball brothers were among the dozens of NBA players who attended and spoke at Black Lives Matter marches. Carmelo Anthony, Dwayne Wade and Chris Paul founded the NBA Social Change Fund, which aims to support critical issues in the Black community. But now it’s time to take it a step further. And the NBA could and should use the WNBA as a blueprint to follow. I have even identified a place where they could make an important impact: Texas. Lee Merritt, who served as one of the lawyers for the Arbery family, is running for attorney general in the second-most populous state in the United States. He would be the most powerful legal figure in a state where battles over racial justice, policing, immigration and voting rights are being fought every day. In my new book, Police Brutality And White Supremacy: The Fight Against American Traditions, I interviewed politicians, athletes, activists and educators as well as victims (and their family members) of police brutality. Many of these people said fighting for laws to be changed is a vital part of changing the status quo. And while many have grown understandably tired of the voting process, local elections stand as one of the best methods to take a serious step in the right direction of justice. And there is no doubt Merritt is committed to justice. “The reason I am moving into the political spectrum is … that we still exist in the deadliest police culture in the modern world. Other countries have done it better. Other countries that we compare ourselves with. We’re in last place in terms of policing our communities without resorting to violence,” he told me on my podcast, The Rematch. “We need a better policy, and we’ve talked about it long enough. Now that we know the truth, let’s stop turning a blind eye to it and pursue policies that will actually lead to long term systemic change. And I believe that means having constitutional attorneys like myself assume the role of attorney general. And not only myself but Letitia James in New York, Keith Ellison in Minnesota, Kwame Raoul in Illinois.” He also acknowledged the tremendous role the NBA could play in achieving real change. “Members of the NBA have the opportunity, they have the position to really have an impact on how we pursue policy not only in the state of Texas but throughout the country and the voices of the NBA are critically important to that,” he said. “We’re asking for the NBA, and everyone else with a platform to join us in this movement because we can really change this country for the better.” He has a great point. Last year, WNBA players showed the power of athletes’ voices. Imagine what prominent Texas NBA players, executives and coaches such as Mark Cuban, Jason Kidd, Gregg Popovich, Tim Hardaway Jr and Luka Doncic (or indeed NFL players like Dallas Cowboys stars Ezekiel Elliott and Dak Prescott) could do if they endorsed Merritt? Slogans on jerseys calling for justice are all well and good. But if NBA players could make a difference in the election for a role as important as Texas attorney general, it would be huge a boost in the fight for justice in the United States.

1/17/2022,"The plight of women’s rights campaigners in Bahrain and Jordan is in the spotlight after new revelations that two prominent female activists were hacked multiple times by countries using NSO Group spyware. An investigation by the human rights group Front Line Defenders (FLD) found that the mobile phones of Ebtisam al-Saegh, a Bahraini human rights defender, and Hala Ahed Deeb, who works with human rights and feminist groups in Jordan, had been hacked using NSO’s Pegasus spyware.  Both women said the discoveries, which were confirmed by security researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, felt like life-changing violations of their privacy, underscoring how such attacks against women were “particularly grievous” given how sensitive information could be weaponised against them. “Since they discovered their phones were infected, they have each been living in a state of daily anxiety and fear. They are especially afraid of the possibility of exposing other female activists and victims they work with, and concerned that their families and friends are now at risk,” FLD said in a statement. According to Citizen Lab’s analysis, al-Saegh’s mobile device was found to have been hacked at least eight times between August and November 2019 using NSO spyware. It followed various incidents in which al-Saegh, who works for Salam for Human Rights and Democracy, was harassed by Bahraini authorities, including being summoned to a Muharraq police station, being interrogated, physically and sexually assaulted, and threatened with rape if she did not stop her activism, FLD said. Al-Saegh said the knowledge that she had been hacked put her in a state of “daily fear and terror”, and had taken away a sense of security she had felt within her own home, because she now felt that her phone was “spying” on her at all times. “Home used to be the only safe space for me, a place for personal freedom where I can take off the veil and exercise my religious and social freedoms without limits,” she said in a statement shared by FLD. “The fear has restricted my work. I am constantly anxious and afraid that I have put others at risk because of their contact with me,” she said. When it is successfully deployed against a mobile phone, Pegasus can intercept a mobile user’s messages and photographs, track their location and turn the phone into a remote listening device. NSO has said that its software is licensed to be used by client countries against suspected terrorists and other serious criminals, and that it investigates credible allegations of abuse by its clients. A spokesperson for NSO said: “We cannot directly comment on a report we haven’t seen, nor investigate based on names received in a press inquiry.” The NSO spokesperson added: “NSO’s firm stance on these issues is that the use of cyber tools in order to monitor dissidents, activists and journalists, regardless of their gender, is a severe misuse of any technology and goes against the desired use of such critical tools. The international community should have zero tolerance policy towards such acts, therefore a global regulation is needed. NSO has proven in the past it has zero-tolerance for these types of misuse, by terminating multiple contracts.” The discovery of spyware on the two activists’ phones follows multiple reports of other female activists and journalists who have been targeted in the past, including the late Emirati activist Alaa Al-Siddiq, and Al Jazeera broadcast journalist Ghada Oueiss. Researchers confirmed that Hala Deeb’s mobile device was infected with Pegasus in March 2021. Deeb said the hacking had made her feel “violated, naked, and with no dignity”. “I have often said that I have nothing to hide, but I realised that privacy in itself is my right,” she said in a statement that was shared by FLD. She added: “I do not communicate with my friends and I avoid talking on the phone as much as I can. I practice a kind of self-censorship sometimes when I wonder what behaviours would provoke those who hacked my phone?”",News/News,Two female activists in Bahrain and Jordan hacked with NSO spyware,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jan/17/two-female-activists-in-bahrain-and-jordan-hacked-with-nso-spyware
1/17/2022,"As a mother to three boys, there are many days when I question the decisions I make. Sometimes, the weight of that – the idea your child’s wellbeing and happiness rests with you – can feel crippling. At the same time, we are bombarded by parents publicising their own pride in their offspring’s achievements on Instagram and Facebook and in WhatsApp groups, meaning it’s easy to feel as if everyone else knows what they’re doing. The idea that people sometimes feel like impostors at work is often discussed. Yet the parental impostor syndrome many people have – that they are faking it, and will never cut it as a parent – is seldom acknowledged.  The psychologist Linda Blair explains: “In 1996, two psychotherapists came up with the concept of impostor syndrome, loosely defining it as doubting your abilities and not feeling good enough. There is a lot of research around impostor syndrome at work, and this falls under that same umbrella. Now I am hearing about this a lot more in clinic, partly because of social media, and ‘fakebook’ parents.” Ranee, 52, lives in south-west London with her husband and their two adopted children. Ranee is of Sri Lankan heritage and her husband’s family are from Mauritius. Because of this, it took a long time for them to be matched with their children as many councils are keen to match the ethnic backgrounds of potential parents and children. During that time, Ranee and her husband went through a rigorous vetting process, yet when the process was complete and they were a family with children, she felt disoriented by how much she didn’t know. “I remember walking into the playground and thinking, ‘Everyone knows you’re not a real mum,’” she says, upon taking her five-year-old to school for the first time. “It was as if I had a siren above me, or ‘fake’ written on my forehead. Just trying to talk to parents on a playdate, or wondering what other kids would eat was tricky. My children were really picky eaters, and all of this made me think I didn’t know what I was doing.” She says she had done courses and read books to try to prepare, but nothing quite readied her for the experience of becoming a parent. “I didn’t have any mum friends and I’d gone straight from working to being a stay-at-home mum. I kept thinking, ‘Does everyone feel like this? Is this how it is?’” Ranee, a food photographer, says now that the adoption is completed, her impostor syndrome has largely gone. “Occasionally it comes back when we’re dealing with school issues, but I now have a network of friends who have also adopted and that has helped me gain some perspective.” As well as the fact that her and her husband went from a couple to parents of two in one day, Ranee thinks anxiety about whether she was doing things “right” played a big role in feeling like an impostor. “I sometimes felt as if there was a model parent out there, but I learned to lower my expectations, and understood that my children don’t know any different. I now subscribe to ‘good enough’ parenting. I know I will make mistakes and I have to forgive myself and not get het up. “I used to want to run out of the playground and hide under the bed. But I’ve learned that you just have to set your own standard. Trust that you will be a great parent, and fight your children’s corner. One day you’ll fail, the next day you’ll feel less of a failure, and so on, until it normalises.” Years later, she says, things look very different. “I have two amazing kids who are teenagers, and I know they will forge their own lives, and I just want them to be happy.” Lucille lives in Suffolk and has five children. It’s hard to imagine someone with so much parenting experience could feel as if she were a “fake” who could be found out – but, she says, social media often leaves her feeling that she is not good enough. “I’m my own worst enemy because my impostor syndrome is self-imposed,” she says. “It’s so easy to scroll through perfect Facebook photos and Instagrammable moments and forget that a lot of it is smoke and mirrors. And nobody has everything that sorted. “Growing up, I wanted children more than I wanted to breathe, so five children – and nine miscarriages later – in a lot of ways this is everything I dreamed of, but I don’t know if I’m ever going to feel like I’ve achieved enough.” Blair says this is something she has heard before. “It is the job of social media to present your best face, so we get a skewed version of parenting,” she says. “One of the things I advise is to try to limit social media, or complement it with face-to-face conversation with other parents. This way you will get a real picture of what is going on, and people are more likely to be honest.” Lucille is a jewellery designer and lives with chronic pain owing to a medical condition. Her husband works long hours, meaning much of the parenting falls to her. She is also home schooling her youngest because he is at risk of anaphylaxis. “For most of our waking hours, it’s me, myself and five. People look at me in horror when I tell them this, but it works for us.” What has put everything into context, she says, is not just time, but the tough situations they have weathered. “Over the past 18 months, we nearly lost Elijah to his anaphylaxis, we all caught Covid twice – and my eldest, Alex, found an unexplained lump in his arm, which gave us an awful scare. The fear at times has been unreal, but, as a parent, all these challenges have helped me realise that I can hold it together through just about anything. “With five children, I’ve had a chance to learn from my mistakes. I know that I can deal with just about anything thrown at me – but that doesn’t mean I feel like I’m nailing it. I just try my best.” Blair points out that being a parent doesn’t necessarily get easier, even with several children: “Many techniques you learn are only temporary. They may work at first, but then children grow, circumstances change, and they stop being effective. You have to learn to forgive yourself because they change.” My husband, Adnan, is 56. He wanted to make it clear that it’s not just mothers who can feel like impostors in their home life. “I had the fairytale illusion of what I’d be like as a dad,” he says. “When our first child was born, I had images of all this stuff we’d do together. It didn’t include pictures of sleepless nights, or every item of clothing being covered in snot and yoghurt.” He also says it doesn’t get any easier with more children, because each child will have a different personality requiring different methods of parenting. “There’s a fine line between child management, focusing on health and safety, and being a present dad, trying to listen to all their voices,” he says. “No one explains that you’re their protector as well as the person meeting their hygiene factors, feeding them, listening to playground politics and building their confidence. You’re the person who is the narrative in their head about how great they are.” Adnan says that though he doesn’t compare himself with other parents, he still finds it hard to shake the fairytale that is firmly in his head, and compared with which he always comes up short. “The continuous refereeing, and the delegate decision-making goes beyond anything I’ve done in the workplace. “I keep asking myself ‘Am I equipped to deal with this?’ I’m a father, a counsellor, a coach, autocratic and democratic. There’s also something about being a parent in your 50s: you don’t have the physicality of your 30s.” Blair, who raised three children herself, says her advice in these circumstances is to spend time with each child on their own. “Find a way, every month, or week, to have an hour with just one child, one on one. Go to a cafe after school or something like that. They will remember that beyond everything else. I used to do this with my children, and it was just magic.” Adam, 61, moved to the UK from Zambia eight years ago with his wife and their three children. Adam’s wife is an architect and spends much of her time in Zambia, while he stays at their home in Carterton in Oxfordshire to look after the children. “I had my first child at 46, and I have a 20-year-old daughter who was five when I married her mum, and who I adopted when she was eight,” he says. “Coming to the UK, I quickly started to feel inferior to other, usually much younger parents who seemed to be effortlessly successful in everything – careers, family, etc, and this continues. “On a practical level there was plenty of help in the early years in Zambia, nannies were easily available, and there was lots of open space.” In his calmer moments, Adam can be realistic about his own skills. “I do believe that I have done a reasonable job. The kids are all, thankfully, well adjusted, reasonably hard working, very sociable.” Yet he says he is haunted at other times by thoughts that he could be doing so much better for his children.“Because I came to fatherhood later on and because we were mostly so far away I never really had the chance to share my experiences of parenting with my contemporaries here, so when we came to the UK most of them had moved on, with kids at university, and I felt quite alone. I have been suffering with depression on and off for 25 years and it often manifests itself through crippling lack of self-esteem. “My children are truly wonderful. I like to think they would tell you that I am ‘the best dad ever’ – it’s just that often I seem unable to accept that myself.” Blair agrees. “We need to figure out our unique identity. When we grasp this, everything becomes easier. We think we have to live to other people’s rules but then we feel inadequate when we don’t meet the mark. All the parenting books are templates. You have to invent your own way of parenting, because every child is unique. “‘Good enough parenting’ theory is a great way of looking at things,” she says. “Perfect parents don’t actually produce the best children. The mistakes we make give our children space to grow into better adults, things to rebel against, and it helps them forge their personality.” The psychotherapist Philippa Perry says that as a society we have become a lot more self-obsessed, putting ourselves at the centre of the relationship instead of our children, which is unhelpful. “We all love our children but what we need to do is respect them. We kid ourselves if we think that we have control. We haven’t got control, but what we do have is control over how we behave, and we need to behave in an authentic and respectful manner with our children. We need to be partners in our endeavours. Respect your children’s time and respect each other.” Exhaustion can make us forget that we are no longer the most important people in our world. For those of us privileged to be parents, maybe we just need to simplify things as we navigate life alongside the little people entrusted to us, and see ourselves through their eyes. The London-based therapist Michelle Qureshi has some words of wisdom, too. “Accept yourself as a human, ditch the comparing with other parents, say to yourself: ‘Overall I do a good job, and they do, too.’ Don’t let your self-doubt define you, let yourself enjoy your own parenting style, whatever that may be.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘I thought: “Everyone knows you’re not a real mum”’ – the pain of parental impostor syndrome,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/17/i-thought-everyone-knows-youre-not-a-real-mum-the-pain-of-parental-impostor-syndrome
1/17/2022,"The Garden The issue of great Jove, draw near, you Muses nine!Help us to praise the blissful plot of garden ground so fine.The garden gives good food and aid for leech’s cure;The garden, full of great delight, his master doth allure.Sweet sallet herbs be here, and herbs of every kind;The ruddy grapes, the seemly fruits, be here at hand to find.Here pleasance wanteth not to make a man full fain;Here marvellous the mixture is of solace and of gain.To water sundry seeds, the furrow by the wayA running river, trilling down with liquor, can convey.Behold, with lively hue fair flow’rs that shine so bright;With riches, like the orient gems, they paint the mould in sight.Bees, humming with soft sound (their murmur is so small),Of blooms and blossoms suck the tops; on dewed leaves they fall.The creeping vine holds down her own bewedded elms,And, wandering out with branches thick, reeds folded overwhelms.Trees spread their coverts wide with shadows fresh and gay;Full well their branched bows defend the fervent sun away.Birds chatter, and some chirp, and some sweet tunes do yield;All mirthful, with their songs so blithe, they make both air and field.The garden it allures, it feeds, it glads the sprite;From heavy hearts all doleful dumps the garden chaseth quite.Strength it restores to limbs, draws and fulfils the sight;with cheer revives the senses all and maketh labour light.O, what delights to us the garden ground doth bring!Seed, leaf, flow’r, fruit, herb, bee, and tree, and more than I may sing!  The Garden was first published among the “Songes and Sonnettes” of Tottel’s Miscellany in 1557. Nicholas Grimald contributed a substantial number of poems to the anthology, and is thought likely to have been one of its editors. More of his work, as well as The Garden, can be read in the reprinted edition here. Grimald – Protestant preacher, scholar, playwright and poet – was born in Huntingdonshire in 1519. He was appointed chaplain to Nicholas Ridley, Bishop of London, in 1552. During the reign of the Catholic Queen Mary, Ridley was executed, and Grimald imprisoned. He recanted and was released, but is said to have reverted later to Protestantism. Little is known about the circumstances of his death, circa 1562. This week’s poem reflects almost none of the turmoil of those years. It preaches the gentlest of sermons, suggesting that what the garden offers contrasts therapeutically with the kinds of pleasure that leave a man “full fain”, ie subject to compulsion. “Here marvellous the mixture is of solace and of gain”. It’s not a profound meditation on gardens, and cannot compete technically with the elegance of Marvell’s poem of the same name, for which it’s likely to have been one of the English models. As a tripping, occasionally tripping-over, pastoral dance, it’s still an engaging introduction to Grimald’s shorter poems. His choice of classical metres here is characteristic. The first line of each couplet is iambic hexameter (six beats, 12 syllables), and it’s necessary to imagine a small pause, even where no comma is indicated, between the first set of three beats and the second, to ensure the rhythmic flow. The second line of each couplet is iambic heptameter – seven beats and 14 syllables. This is how I scan the invocation of the first two lines, a pattern that seems to work throughout the poem. “The issue of great Jove, / draw near, you Muses nine!Help us to praise the blissful plot of garden ground so fine.” There are moments when the attention of Grimald’s Muses seems casually general, and others where you feel they’re getting down to serious business. The details about the bees, murmuring softly and falling drunkenly on to the flowers’ “dewed leaves” is delightful. And the subsequent observation of the “creeping vine” introduces a visually effective, predatory metaphor into the idyll, the “bewedded elms” being lovingly strangled by this ambitious plant (which sounds more like ivy than a grape-vine). Perhaps the hint of a political analogy has invaded the garden after all. Bees, humming with soft sound (their murmur is so small),Of blooms and blossoms suck the tops; on dewed leaves they fall.The creeping vine holds down her own bewedded elms,And, wandering out with branches thick, reeds folded overwhelms. A cure for all kinds of ills, including melancholy’s “doleful dumps”, the garden’s bounty expands magnificently in the final couplet. The monosyllabic list of the last line is a perfect fit with the meter, although it looks cluttered, and enunciation may require practice. O, what delights to us the garden ground doth bring!Seed, leaf, flow’r, fruit, herb, bee, and tree, and more than I may sing! If you can immediately recite “Seed, leaf” as an iamb, you’re a better reciter than I amb.

1/17/2022," Movies can make lifting our spirits feel like mighty hard work. Like a two-hour Haribo binge, feelgood movies often involve a violent sugar rush, a recipe for migraine and hives. So we should treasure any film as purely, perfectly uplifting as Galaxy Quest. The comedy involves the ageing cast of a much-loved TV space opera, abducted by gentle extraterrestrials unwitting of the gulf between fact and fantasy. The meta Hollywood comedy is smart; the gags about fandom beautifully observed. But more than that, no beating heart could fail to be gladdened by a film that suggests our sorry species may just be redeemable. And that aliens may yet avoid Elon Musk being their first encounter with humanity. Danny Leigh The first streaming-only album to ever win a Grammy, 2016’s Coloring Book remains Chance the Rapper’s most accomplished work, bridging the gap between hip-hop and gospel with a wide grin on its face. Across 14 tracks, the Chicago native toes a perfect line between swaggering braggadocio and gentle, stirring home town nostalgia, with a veritable feast of guests both big and small: Kanye West, Jamila Woods, Anderson .Paak, Jay Electronica. Whether you’re religious or not, the infectious jubilance of redemptive love, self-acceptance and sharp one-liners will shed some light on even the darkest of January days. Jenessa Williams If Sterlin Harjo and Taika Waititi’s Disney+ comedy about a charmingly half-baked criminal gang of Indigenous American kids in small town Oklahoma doesn’t cheer you up, you might need to consider hibernation. Their criminality, such as it is, is at the harmless, amusingly inept end of the scale; as we meet them, they’re stealing a lorry load of crisps and selling them from a roadside stall. Really, what gang status means here is an affirmation of friendship; an expression of mutual support; a desire to have each other’s backs. Much like Waititi’s funny, lovely film The Hunt for the Wilderpeople, it’s about our need to strike out alone but also our need to belong. Full of laughs but overflowing with warmth and wisdom, too. Phil Harrison This is one of art history’s rare full, toothy smiles, and it belongs to a young working woman, expertly balancing a basket of shellfish on her head. Unlike the staged hauteur of 18th-century aristocratic portraits, her movement and spontaneity suggest a real-life chance encounter on the street, captured in an experimental, impressionist oil sketch of rough, ready strokes. William Hogarth makes you feel her momentary joy; a brief, dazzling wonder of everyday life that hits you like sun breaking through clouds. Skye Sherwin If you are starting to feel like the dark winter skies are bearing down on you, Antoine de Saint‑Exupéry’s Wind, Sand and Stars will open them up again. In poetic, vivid prose, the French hero relates his experiences as a pioneering pilot in the 1920s, helping to develop early air postal routes across the Sahara and Andes. Again and again, Saint-Exupéry climbed into the exposed cockpit of his fragile plane, pointed its nose into the black night, spun the propeller and roared into the future. It’s a book brimming not only with the excitement of discovery, but also the more simple joy of life. Saint-Exupéry may be best known for his beautiful children’s story The Little Prince, but this is even more enchanting.

1/17/2022,"Here is an intriguing cine-novella from Georgian film-maker Tamar Shavgulidze, which is at first unassumingly contemporary and realist, but which then takes a deadpan left turn into something really strange; it becomes like something from the 1960s counterculture, yet is as coolly paced and controlled as everything that has gone before.  Initially, Comets seems like a straightforwardly bittersweet “reunion” tale, full of poignant regret. Nana (Ketevan Gegeshidze) is a middle-aged widow who is pottering about her garden one sunlit afternoon, squabbling mildly with her grownup daughter Irina (Ekaterine Kalatozishvili), when suddenly they have a visitor: a rather stylishly attired woman of Nana’s age, also called Irina (Nino Kasradze). This is the person with whom Nana had a semi-secret love affair when they were teenagers, which caused much local scandal. Irina ran away to begin a glamorous existence in Krakow and Berlin and Nana blandly (or perhaps penitentially) stayed in her home town and had children: Irina is of course named after her lost love and like the older Irina she exasperates Nana by wearing sunglasses to conceal her mood. There is much sadness in Nana’s life, particularly in her relationship with her late husband. The two women’s conversation now is interspersed with flashback scenes of them together in this very same garden, the two being played as teenagers by Mariam Iremashvili and Nina Mazodier. What is there between them now? Reproach? Sadness? Or a flash of something else — maybe that they could still revive their old feelings, because what on earth have they got to lose? Love is a comet that blazes into our lives all too rarely. But could it be that as young people Nana and Irina experienced something else: something even more unearthly and exalting and intergalactic? A visitation of something rich and strange, something that made sense of how alien they felt? An interesting experiment in the alternative reality that is love.

1/17/2022,"There are still almost 10 months until Florida’s voters elect their next governor, but the campaign of the Republican incumbent, Ron DeSantis, appears well under way. In a red-meat-for-the-base address at the opening of Florida’s legislature last week, themed around the concept of “freedom” but described by critics as a fanfare of authoritarianism, DeSantis gave a clear indication of the issues he believes are on voters’ minds. They include fighting the White House over Covid-19, ballot box fraud, critical race theory in schools and defunding law enforcement.  Yet to opponents of the Donald Trump protege, who is tipped for his own presidential run in 2024, DeSantis has chosen to focus on problems that don’t exist in Florida, either to distract from real priorities or to bolster the Trumpist base and improve on his narrow victory over the Democrat Andrew Gillum in 2018. “We have real issues that need to be addressed, and the governor is chasing boogeymen,” said Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democratic state representative and frequent DeSantis critic. “We have an affordable housing crisis with exorbitant rent hikes of up to 30% that people can’t afford. We have surging property insurance rates. We have a healthcare crisis with 22,000 Floridians with disabilities who are on waitlist to get the services that they deserve. “And Governor DeSantis is focused on fighting ‘wokeness’ in the 2022 legislative session, with the Stop Woke Act. He wants to focus on fighting critical race theories in our schools. That does not exist. It’s not even a thing.” A wave of criticism followed DeSantis’s speech, which came at the start of a 60-day legislative session in Tallahassee during which Republicans will also pursue a Mississippi-style 15-week abortion ban under the guise of “reducing fetal and infant mortality”. DeSantis has said the proposal, which has no exception for rape or incest, is “very reasonable”. But it is his anti-mask approach to Covid-19, and his constant feuding with Joe Biden and Anthony Fauci, of which DeSantis appears most proud, lauding Florida as “the freest state” for his outlawing of “authoritarian, arbitrary and seemingly never-ending mandates”. “While so many around the country have consigned the people’s rights to the graveyard, Florida has stood as freedom’s vanguard,” DeSantis insisted. On Thursday, Florida’s death toll from Covid-19 surpassed 63,000. “Floridians are exhausted by the politicization of Covid-19,” Smith said. “They’re tired of fighting about masks, they’re tired of fighting about vaccines. And they’re tired of the governor continuing to focus on these culture wars that do nothing to promote the prosperity of our state.” It was the Omicron-fuelled surge pushing the state’s coronavirus numbers up by almost 950% that caused more controversy over the recent holidays, when critics accused DeSantis of being missing in action. The governor’s press team inadvertently added to the “Where’s Ron?” confusion by posting on social media two-week-old pictures of him at a bagel store, insisted it was his prerogative to take a few days off if he wanted, then regrouped to attack anybody who suggested he was taking a vacation. DeSantis reappeared after a 13-day absence to say he had been attending chemotherapy sessions with his wife, Casey, who has breast cancer. The first weeks of the new year, in which he will seek his second term, possibly as a springboard to a likely 2024 presidential run, were also bumpy. Nikki Fried, the Democratic Florida agriculture commissioner and potential opponent in November, accused the DeSantis administration of stockpiling about 1m Covid-19 tests in a warehouse as they expired, which state officials later admitted was true after earlier denials. And a planned press briefing in Jacksonville was abruptly postponed after the unseemly spectacle of a peaceful, disabled Black community activist led away in handcuffs and cited for trespass after asking to speak with DeSantis about his coronavirus policies. “No, this isn’t from 1955. This is from an hour ago. At the Governor’s press conference,” Democratic state congresswoman Michele Rayner tweeted, noting that Ben Frazier, founder of Jacksonville’s Northside Coalition, was also denied use of his electric scooter. “A Black man dared to refuse to leave until he met with the governor. From my understanding he wasn’t disrespectful. But you know Ronnie can’t handle criticism of any kind.” Christina Pushaw, DeSantis’s spokesperson, said in a statement that Frazier had a history of “disruptive behavior” and was trespassing “in a secured facility”, even though the meeting took place in a public building. Critics say that while DeSantis has been promoting the rights of citizens to make their own decisions, he has become increasingly authoritarian. He stripped local authorities of powers to instigate coronavirus mitigation efforts and banned school districts from imposing mask mandates. In south Florida in particular, schools say they are “struggling to cope” with staff shortages and student absences. A self-professed law-and-order governor, DeSantis has also offered unvaccinated cops a $5,000 bounty to relocate to Florida, and plans a state paramilitary force outside federal control. The former Florida governor Charlie Crist, another possible opponent in November, accused DeSantis of wanting his own “handpicked secret police”. Democrats, however, concede they face challenges in unseating DeSantis, a strong favorite for re-election in polls taken last year. Florida’s new restrictive voting rights law limits drop boxes and mail-in ballots, and Democrats have recently been overtaken by registered Republican voters for the first time. Analysts say DeSantis also has the advantage of a strong state economy, alongside his pugnacious style of leadership. “DeSantis is, to many Republicans, Florida’s incarnation of Donald Trump, his successor, his alter ego, his clone, whatever you want to call it,” said Darryl Paulson, professor emeritus of government at the University of South Florida. “He’s certainly run very much in the style of Trump, this in-your-face, critical stance he has taken on a lot of issues, which have ingrained him with Republicans. But the GOP in Florida makes up a little less than 40% of the electorate, so to win a statewide race you need to appeal to the no-party-affiliated, independent voters. “How do you appeal to those when you run a campaign trying to bash other people in the face, so to speak? That can play well with your base but not so well especially with independents.” Paulson, however, sees an uphill battle for Democrats. “Every election cycle you’re really appealing to a completely new electorate. When you add in the elderly factor in Florida, people dying off and replaced by newcomers in the state and younger people, it’s hard to project how they’re going to align themselves,” he said. “Right now, the advantage is clearly Republican. But all sorts of things could quickly change. It could be a policy issue that emerges, or a politician that emerges, the two most important things to affect Florida politics.”",News/US news,Ron DeSantis touts his state as ‘freedom’s vanguard’ but critics see authoritarianism,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/17/ron-desantis-florida-reelection-freedoms-vanguard-critics-see-authoritarian-streak
1/17/2022,"Unilever has pledged to grow its health, beauty and hygiene business as investors dumped its shares after its failed £50bn approach for GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer products arm. GSK rejected three Unilever bids for the consumer products arm it is seeking to spin off, the last of which was worth £50bn. The pharmaceutical company on Saturday said that the offer “fundamentally undervalued” the business, which owns brands including Panadol pain relief and Sensodyne toothpaste.  Unilever shares dropped by 6% on Monday morning, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. GSK shares rose by 5%, making it the top riser among the UK’s blue-chip companies as investors appeared to bet that a higher bid would materialise. Unilever, the owner of brands ranging from Dove soap to Marmite, has been under pressure in recent months under the leadership of the chief executive, Alan Jope. Its share price was almost a quarter below its record 2019 high before the bids were revealed. GSK plans to demerge the consumer products business by the middle of the year, and the former Tesco boss Sir Dave Lewis has been lined up to chair it. Some analysts have estimated GSK may be looking for as much as £60bn for a takeover. The GSK consumer business would be a “strong strategic fit”, Unilever said on Monday. Unilever highlighted GSK’s oral care brands, which also include Aquafresh toothpaste, as well as its vitamins, minerals and supplements brands such as Centrum and over-the-counter medicines. Unilever outlined a strategy update focused on investment in “sustainable market growth” and using its already strong presence in emerging markets, which are expected to use more consumer products as citizens become richer. “The management and board of Unilever are committed to accelerating the company’s growth and repositioning the portfolio into higher growth categories,” the company said, adding that it would sell off lower-growth businesses to fund the purchases. Later this month it plans to update investors on a new operating structure that it hopes will improve its performance. Unilever also tried to forestall concerns that acquisitions would force it to take on more debt, saying that it would return to current levels of debt relative to its size “over the short to medium term”. Maryam Ali, an analyst at Creditsights, a debt rating agency, said in a note to clients that she could see Unilever’s rationale for the GSK consumer products bid, and said that its focus on consumer health was unsurprising given recent acquisitions. “Ever since the aborted Kraft-Heinz takeover attempt in 2017, it always seemed like a matter of ‘when’ rather than ‘if’ that the company would carry out a big deal of its own to protect its long-term future,” Ali wrote.",News/Business,Unilever to expand health and beauty business after failed GSK approach,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/17/unilever-health-and-beauty-business-gsk-ftse-100-bid
1/17/2022,"Cameron Norrie certainly never stopped trying. Even as game after game fell away and the match rushed to an increasingly unavoidable outcome, his footwork remained pristine, he continued to land as many returns as he could and he searched diligently for solutions.  But unlike for so much of the past 12 months, no solutions came. In just one hour, 42 minutes, Sebastian Korda dismantled Norrie, the 12th seed, 6-3, 6-0, 6-4 in the first round of the Australian Open. After a breakthrough year so memorable that his coach, Facundo Lugones, was named the ATP’s coach of the year, the defeat marked Norrie’s fourth loss of four in the 2022 season and his second consecutive grand slam first round defeat. While two of Norrie’s losses had been competitive defeats against higher ranked players, Norrie was confounded by how poor his showing was on Monday. “Right now, I can’t,” he said after being asked if he knows why he was unable to find an acceptable level. “Just feeling good physically, I had a week off to prepare, prepared as well as I could, and just I was slow, I was missing routine backhands, which I never miss. I honestly can’t put a finger on it. I just need to get better and improve.” One of the obvious factors, which Norrie stressed, was the quality of his opponent across the net. Korda is one of the toughest unseeded players in the draw and at 20 years old he has already reached the fourth round of two majors, finishing last year as runner up at the Next Gen ATP Finals. Korda plays with a distinctive style. He stands at 6ft 5in yet despite his stature his serve, although solid on Monday, is still a work in progress. He has earnt his keep in his young career due to his pristine, well-timed strokes that he can strike early, redirect to all parts of the court, and his skilful returning and net game behind them. He spent the match glued to the baseline and dictating until the end. Having spent his entire professional career as the underdog and challenger against most top 100 players, it was always evident this sophomore season would mark a new challenge for Norrie. He will now, like many before him, have to adjust to the new reality of being and he is doing so after playing 81 matches in 2021. His year finished on 30 November after he emptied his tank in the midst of leading Great Britain in the Davis Cup and the fleeting time before the start of the season meant he postponed his pre-season until after his trip to Australia. “I don’t know why I played the way I did today. I was feeling good physically, and, yeah, I played a lot of matches, but this is what we are paid to do and [it’s] just not good enough. Just need to raise my standards, practice, matches, and execute a lot better,” he said. Norrie will take a few days off, then he will start to prepare for his next event in Rotterdam, undertaking all of the physical work he had postponed after the season. As Norrie departs Australia, the second day of the Australian Open will see a flurry of British action with Harriet Dart, Andy Murray, Heather Watson, Liam Broady and Emma Raducanu all starting their campaigns. In the evening session, Broady faces Nick Kyrgios in the first round. Kyrgios is now ranked 115th and he hasn’t yet competed in 2021 after withdrawing from his opening two events with asthma and then Covid, but as usual, he is one good serving day away from a great performance. Later on Tuesday night, Emma Raducanu will headline Margaret Court Arena as she continues to find her feet after her own recent bout of Covid. Raducanu will face a fellow grand slam champion, Sloane Stephens, for the first time in her career and she will step onto the court looking to start her Australian Open career correctly.",Sport/Sport,‘Just not good enough’ – Cameron Norrie laments early Australian Open exit,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/17/just-not-good-enough-cameron-norrie-laments-early-australian-open-exit
1/17/2022,"Nadhim Zahawi has denied the government is rushing out a series of policy ideas in an attempt to save Boris Johnson, arguing that the prime minister is safe in his job despite a string of Downing Street parties during lockdowns. “I think Boris Johnson has done the right thing to apologise,” the education secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, saying the prime minister should get credit for having correctly called “big, big decisions” in areas such as Brexit and vaccines.  Asked three times if Johnson was safe, Zahawi eventually agreed, saying: “Yes, he is, because he’s human and we make mistakes.” He rejected the idea that ministers had been attempting to distract attention from Johnson’s political woes by briefing friendly newspapers on policies such as involving the Royal Navy in an attempt to stop small boat crossings in the Channel, and the likely end to the BBC licence fee. “I’m glad you recognise that all this stuff about the government bringing stuff in the weekend is not true, because we work through policies based on our manifesto commitment,” Zahawi told Today. In an earlier interview with Times Radio, Zahawi rejected the wider idea that No 10 had launched a fightback to save Johnson’s job under titles such as Operation Save Big Dog or Operation Red Meat. “Honestly, I’m the secretary of state for education, I’m a member of the cabinet,” he said. “I don’t recognise that language about red meat or big dogs. All I can say to you is the prime minister’s focused on dealing with the big issues.” Questioned repeatedly on Today about whether the string of revelations about apparent social events in Downing Street during Covid restrictions meant Johnson had to change his approach or be ejected, Zahawi refused to agree, arguing it was not possible to determine if the prime minister had done anything wrong before the publication of a report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray. “It’s right that the prime minister recognises the level of anger and, of course, the feeling of unfairness, which is why he was right to apologise,” Zahawi said. “I would say that, actually, the value of fairness matters to people. Yes of course they’re feeling angry, feeling upset. They can’t turn the clock back. What we do about it is the fairness argument. And I think it’s important that you don’t condemn a man before you’ve had the investigation.” Asked how Johnson could persuade people he was serious about the issue, Zahawi said: “It begins with an apology, it begins with recognising that we need to get the evidence, and the investigation is going to be important. Because how do you change a culture if you don’t have the evidence?” In an echo of Downing Street’s defence of Johnson over one of the most damning allegations, that he spent 25 minutes in the Downing Street garden as staff held a “bring your own booze” party on 20 May 2020, Zahawi said the prime minister “implicitly” believed he had not broken any rules. Asked why he had caveated his argument with “implicitly”, a word he had also used in earlier interviews, Zahawi said: “I’m repeating to you what I heard the prime minister say at the dipatch box in the chamber for his statement [last Wednesday]. He thought he was going outside for 25 minutes to motivate his workforce, and come back in and continue to work, and he apologised for it.” He added: “If somebody thought that they were going outside to motivate their staff – that is what he thought, that he wasn’t actually breaking the rules.”",News/Politics,Zahawi denies government is launching policy push to save Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/17/zahawi-denies-government-launching-policy-push-save-boris-johnson
1/17/2022,"The family of an Indigenous man who died after being sent home from a regional New South Wales hospital has staged a protest demanding accountability and urgent changes in the way Aboriginal people are treated in the NSW health system. Protesters gathered outside Dubbo hospital on Monday to demand a coronial inquest into the death of Kamilaroi/Dunghutti man Ricky “Dougie” Hampson Jr in August 2021.  His family claims the 36-year-old was released from the hospital without appropriate treatment partly because he was Indigenous. According to a statement from the National Justice Project on behalf of Hampson’s family, Hampson presented to Dubbo hospital with severe stomach pain and a popping or tearing feeling in his stomach on 15 August. He was sedated, given painkillers and sent home, allegedly without a proper diagnosis. The statement said he died within 18 hours from two perforated duodenal ulcers. His father, Ricky Hampson Sr, said Monday’s protest was intended to give Dougie a voice. Hampson Sr believes his son may not have been given potentially life-saving treatment because he had identified himself to staff as a recreational cannabis user. “An Aboriginal person turns up and admits to smoking marijuana, they presume straight away that because he’s complained of pain in his abdomen, they put it down to cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.” “We want a coronial inquest into Dougie’s death. We want change within the NSW health system,” Hampson Sr said. Protesters including family and friends gathered at Teresa Maliphant park and marched to Dubbo hospital’s main entrance on Monday carrying photographs of the deceased father of eight and signs bearing messages such as “A simple scan would have saved Dougie’s life”. Talesha Murray, the eldest of Hampson Jr’s children, told the rally: “I feel for my brothers and sisters..” Hampson Jr’s youngest child was seven years old. Murray told Guardian Australia: “Today shouldn’t even be happening but we are here. I want justice for my father and every black person who got put in the same situation.” Hampson Sr said five months after his son’s death, the situation felt “torturous”. “People say time heals all wounds but it doesn’t – this is something we’ll never get over,” he said. “When me and his mother are home by ourselves, we look at his photo and we break down. The only reason we have the strength to get through today is because Douglas’s spirit is here with us. “Unless people are held accountable, Aboriginal people will keep dying like this.” The family wants the health minister “to step in and make sure this never happens again anywhere in NSW”. “The NSW government has been on notice of this systemic issue, at least since the death of Naomi Williams, and Dougie’s death confirms that there is a need for urgent action,” Hampson Sr said. The coroner who investigated the case of Williams, a 27-year-old who was six months pregnant when she died of a treatable infection at Tumut hospital in 2016, found there was implicit bias in the way hospital treated the Wiradjuri woman. Wendy Brookman, a Butchulla woman who attended the protest for Hampson, said: “It’s not the first time and the scariest thought is that we don’t believe it’s going to be the last either.” George Newhouse, a solicitor and the chief executive of the National Justice Project, said: “We need to learn lessons.” Newhouse is acting for Hampson Sr and Dougie’s mother, Lydia Chatfield. “A coronial inquest would provide an opportunity to observe systemic patterns and to prevent deaths in similar circumstances, and most importantly to provide transparency and accountability to a system that too often fails Aboriginal people,” Newhouse said. The lawyer has heard other complaints from First Nations people about their treatment at Dubbo hospital. “Some have told me that they are prepared to drive five hours to attend a hospital in Sydney rather than present themselves at Dubbo hospital.” Newhouse said Aboriginal health liaison workers should be employed across Australia, particularly within emergency departments. He also suggested leaders “acknowledge the existence of implicit bias in healthcare and address it with objective tools, measure it and report on it”. He said a deputy state coroner made “profound” recommendations after the death of Naomi Williams but they were yet to be implemented statewide or nationally. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It’s absolutely essential that hospitals introduce anti-racism, anti-discrimination, anti-bias policies and mandate the provision of culturally safe care to individuals.
