1/17/2022,"An 86-year-old woman was murdered in a “horrific” attack that left her 88-year-old husband with life-threatening injuries, police have said. Freda and Ken Walker were attacked in their home in a Derbyshire village on Saturday morning.  Police confirmed on Sunday that emergency services had been called to the couple’s home when neighbours raised the alarm at about 9.30am on Saturday. While detectives have not confirmed the nature of the incident, they are understood to be looking for suspects who managed to get inside the Walkers’ semi-detached home in the village of Langwith Junction. Ch Supt Hayley Barnett, of Derbyshire police, said on Sunday: “This couple were well known here to this community and I know that many people who know them will be shocked by this horrific incident.” Neighbours paid tribute to the “lovely couple” who were said to be devoted to each other and popular in the local community. Ken Walker, who remained in critical condition in hospital on Sunday, is understood to have been a local councillor and a school governor until relatively recently. Jonathan Hilliar, who lives locally, told the BBC: “Every time I went past they would say hello. They were such a sweet old couple. I just don’t get it, I really don’t.” Barnett urged anyone with information about the incident to contact the police urgently. She added: “Whilst I can’t talk about the mechanics or how people came to be in the address, what I do urge people to do is keep good security to their homes. “Keep their doors and windows locked, don’t let any strangers in, don’t keep any valuables on display and have a means of making contact with emergency services.”",News/UK news,"Derbyshire woman, 86, murdered in ‘horrific’ attack",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/16/derbyshire-woman-86-attack-walker-langwith-junction
1/17/2022,"There was an extra edge, and an extra punch, to Jurgen Klopp’s trademark celebration in front of the Kop after the final whistle that suggested this was more than just a routine win for Liverpool. There may be a gulf between themselves and Manchester City at the top of the Premier League but there is no sign of deflation creeping in at Anfield. Liverpool leapfrogged Chelsea into second place with an ultimately comfortable victory over Brentford, who made life complicated for their hosts until Fabinho opened the scoring. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Takumi Minamino, two players with added responsibility to improve Liverpool’s threat in front of goal in the absence of world-class teammates, obliged with a goal each in the second half. Fabinho’s goal a minute before the break lanced growing irritation with Liverpool’s performance around Anfield and punctured Brentford’s previously comfortable resistance.  Liverpool were without Mohamed Salah or Sadio Mane in a Premier League game for the first time since the former’s arrival from Roma in 2017, and for 44 minutes it showed as the hosts increasingly resorted to hopeful crosses that suited the visitors’ three towering central defenders. A series of misplaced passes out of defence that gifted Brentford their brightest moments also added to Anfield’s anxiety. The mood, the contest and the threat from Klopp’s team all changed on the stroke of half-time, however. Trent Alexander-Arnold operated as an auxiliary forward at times as Liverpool pressed the visitors into a deep retreat and it was from his corner that Liverpool broke through. Brentford had defended impressively up until that point but, as the right-back’s delivery arrived in the six-yard box, it was allowed to bounce through to the back post where Fabinho held off Kristoffer Ajer and headed in from close range. Brentford’s afternoon deteriorated from that point, although Bryan Mbeumo was close to levelling early in the second half when turning away from Joel Matip and shooting narrowly wide of Alisson’s right-hand post. Liverpool’s intensity, threat and composure all improved after the restart. Diogo Jota, tireless on the left of Klopp’s forward line, struck a post with the Brentford goalkeeper Alvaro Fernandez well beaten after a surging run from Alexander-Arnold. The Liverpool manager opted for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on the right of Roberto Firmino, with Takumi Minamino dropping to the bench following Thursday’s stalemate with Arsenal in the Carabao Cup semi-final. The switch was vindicated when the makeshift forward doubled Liverpool’s advantage from Andy Robertson’s perfectly flighted cross. Oxlade-Chamberlain stole in ahead of Brentford substitute Sergi Canos as Robertson’s delivery sailed just over Ethan Pinnock and sent an unstoppable diving header inside Fernandez’s near post. In keeping with the injury misfortune that has plagued his Anfield career, Oxlade-Chamberlain turned his ankle moments later and had to be replaced by the Japan international. Minamino had been on the pitch only three minutes when he benefited from Firmino’s unselfishness – and Brentford’s carelessness – to score Liverpool’s third. Fernandez and Pinnock over-elaborated from a simple goal-kick before the keeper played Christian Norgaard into trouble on the edge of his own area. Firmino pounced to dispossess the midfielder and find Minamino unmarked in front of goal. Minamino squared to Firmino, Firmino repaid the favour and helped the substitute repair his confidence after that 90th-minute miss against Arsenal with a simple tap-in. Kaide Gordon became the fourth-youngest player in Liverpool’s history when he was introduced late on. He had a glorious chance to became the club’s youngest goalscorer when sent clean through by Minamino but Fernandez saved to deny him that place in the record books.",Sport/Football,Takumi Minamino seals comfortable win for Liverpool over Brentford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/16/liverpool-brentford-premier-league-match-report
1/17/2022,"This wildly entertaining contest was a good advert for playing on. Although Leeds United resembled the walking wounded at times, they have set the standard for the rest of the Premier League to follow. Cry off because of a draining injury list? Not a chance with Marcelo Bielsa in charge. As ever, the Argentinian stands apart as something different in English football. For all his side’s naive tendencies, there is a purity to Leeds under Bielsa’s watch. They have battled on with a lengthy injury list all season and diced with danger throughout, but deserved victory. Raphinha was superb and Jack Harrison’s hat-trick moved Leeds nine points clear of the bottom three.  West Ham, whose resources were also stretched by injuries, ran out of steam. They had Michail Antonio playing as an auxiliary wing-back during the dying stages and it seemed that playing three games in a week had caught up with them. They defended poorly and will rue missing an opportunity to pull clear of Arsenal and Tottenham. Leeds, who were without key players such as Diego Llorente, Liam Cooper, Patrick Bamford and Kalvin Phillips, did not have time to feel sorry for themselves. There was no attempt to get the game postponed, even though they were missing nine players and had to fill their bench with academy players. It was simply a case of getting on with the job and that refusal to down tools looked like a smart move when Leeds took control of the early stages, hogging the ball and surprising West Ham with the speed of their passing and movement. Too open in midfield without Tomas Soucek, who was still in quarantine, there was a vulnerability to West Ham. The hosts barely had a touch at first and could have no complaints when a silky run from Raphinha, who had beaten Aaron Cresswell to a long ball down the right flank, led to Harrison sweeping Leeds into a deserved lead. Slow to react to the danger, West Ham were all over the place as Raphinha found Mateusz Klich. The midfielder aimed a shot towards the far corner and although Lukasz Fabianski pushed it away, the goalkeeper was helpless when Adam Forshaw collected the rebound and teed up Harrison. The winger’s finish left no room for any debate and West Ham had a problem on their hands. Moyes must have been concerned about his side’s sluggishness. Leeds could have doubled their lead when Dan James fired over and there was always a sense that the visitors fancied their chances of hurting Issa Diop and Craig Dawson, an unconvincing duo at the heart of West Ham’s defence. Gradually, though, West Ham began to impose themselves. Pascal Struijk made a vital block from Antonio, who was fortunate only to be booked for a wild challenge on Robin Koch, and Bielsa’s problems increased when Forshaw and Junior Firpo limped off midway through the opening period, although there was something admirable about Leeds’s fearlessness in the face of adversity. They had named a 15-year-old, Archie Gray, on the bench and Bielsa’s response to losing Forshaw and Firpo was to introduce two teenagers; something, perhaps, for the Premier League’s board to consider the next time a club asks for a postponement. That said, there was more of a skittishness to Leeds after Lewis Bate and Leo Hjelde entered the fray. Weaknesses at set-pieces were an issue. Cresswell had already swung in one corner for Dawson to nod wide from close range and there was no reprieve for Leeds when the left-back whipped in another delivery, Bowen losing Stuart Dallas and heading past Illan Meslier for his ninth goal of the season. Panic over? Not quite. Leeds were ahead again three minutes later. Raphinha swung in a corner from the left, Luke Ayling attacked it and Harrison took advantage of dreadful marking by bundling the ball in at the far post. By now, the game had become comically stretched. Declan Rice screwed a shot wide after running through on goal and James was wasteful at the other end, shooting straight at Fabianski after another error from Dawson. Leeds would regret not extending their advantage before the break. West Ham emerged for the second half with more intent, Rice firing over, and they levelled again when Antonio made up for a poor touch by releasing Pablo Fornals, who deceived Meslier with a clever finish. Again, though, Leeds simply dusted themselves down. Dallas was inches away from restoring their lead and West Ham looked uncomfortable whenever Bielsa’s players pressed them. Manuel Lanzini was overwhelmed in central midfield, where the absence of Soucek left Rice with too many fires to extinguish, and the pressure told when the lethargic Nikola Vlasic was dispossessed by Klich in the 60th minute. West Ham were in trouble when the ball broke to Raphinha. The Brazilian, who would later crash a free-kick against the post, spotted a huge gap to his left and freed Harrison, who lifted his shot over Fabianski. It was no more than Leeds deserved. They would not be denied, even though Klich was unlucky to have a goal ruled out for offside after more brilliance from Raphinha. West Ham, who were also frustrated when Andriy Yarmolenko had a late equaliser disallowed for offside, would miss a glorious chance to equalise in added time when Bowen chested over from close range.",Sport/Football,Jack Harrison hat-trick stuns West Ham to fire Leeds to thrilling victory,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/16/west-ham-leeds-premier-league-match-report
1/17/2022,"Two startlingly different figures for what is ostensibly the same count have been released within days of each other: the government reported 150,000 Covid-19 deaths days before the UK’s lead statistical agency reported a death toll of more than 175,000. The difference between the two figures is stark but easily explained: the government’s figures only count those deaths that are known to have occurred within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. The Office for National Statistics, on the other hand, counts all deaths where the virus was mentioned on the death certificate.  But regardless of the counting method, the numbers represent individual human tragedies. So, what do we know about the 175,000 people whose deaths have been recorded to date? The pandemic has taken the greatest toll on elderly people: across the UK since the start of the pandemic more than seven in 10 registered deaths have been among those aged 75 or older. Meanwhile deaths among those aged 44 or younger made up under 2% of the total. Nevertheless, the proportion of deaths made up by older people has changed over the course of the pandemic. During the first wave, which continued for most of 2020, three-quarters of all deaths were among those aged 75+. In subsequent waves this fell, in part thanks to vaccinations, decreasing to 59% of all deaths during the period where Delta dominated. Vaccination rates are highest among elderly people, NHS figures show. ONS analysis covering the first 10 months of 2021 shows risk of death involving Covid-19 to be 28 times higher among unvaccinated people than among the vaccinated population. The data – shows that deaths involving Covid-19 have been consistently lower for vaccinated people, which the ONS defines as people who received their vaccine at least 21 days beforehand, compared with unvaccinated people – a trend apparent across all age groups. Throughout the whole of the pandemic, gender disparities regarding coronavirus deaths have been evident. According to ONS figures regarding coronavirus deaths registered up to 31 December 2021, men made up 94,433 – or 54% – of total coronavirus deaths within this period, despite the fact that men make up only 49% of England and Wales’ population. Although these percentages remained roughly similar throughout the pandemic, there were variations of this disproportionality between the different waves. Within the Delta wave, 58% of deaths were of males, whereas the lowest proportion of male deaths took place within the Alpha wave – at 53%. The theories as why this is include differences in lockdown behaviour between the sexes, men being more likely to drink, smoke and experience obesity; and differing immune responses. The spread of Covid deaths has not been even across the country: the crude death rate remains highest in the north-west, driven by the high number of deaths in 2020 after high case rates in the UK in the early part of the pandemic. Across the entire pandemic the virus has claimed 23,659 lives in the region, equivalent to a crude death rate of 321 per 100,000 population, higher than any other both by absolute numbers and rate. Among the four nations of the UK, Wales recorded the highest death rate of 291 coronavirus deaths per 100,000 population, driven partly by the fact that it has the highest proportion of people aged 65-plus of the UK’s constituency countries. The UK-wide crude death rates stood at 262 deaths per 100,000 registered deaths at the end of 2021. At the start of the pandemic – with essential workers going out to work while anyone who could stayed home – research focused on the link between occupation and Covid mortality risk. The ONS last published data on this topic in early 2021, analysing close to 8,000 deaths involving coronavirus within the working age population across England and Wales to the end of 2020, showing that those working in close proximity to others had higher death rates. Again, men were more exposed making up nearly two-thirds of these deaths, with male workers in the care and leisure sectors and other public-facing jobs experiencing higher death rates. Female death rates were highest among machine operatives, those in the caring and leisure industries, and other customer-facing occupations. Among healthcare occupations, nurses had statistically significantly higher rates of death involving Covid-19 when compared with those of the same age and sex in the population. The ONS conducted provisional analysis, looking at deaths involving coronavirus between 2 March and 15 May 2020. The analysis found that, when taking into account size and age variations across different ethnicities, the mortality rate was highest among black men. After adjusting for region, population density and other sociodemographic characteristics, the raised risk of death for black people was 2 times greater for men and 1.4 times greater for women compared with white people. The analysis was updated in May 2021 and found that the mortality risk for black people relative to white British people was reduced in the second wave. Nevertheless, “most black and South Asian groups remained at higher risk than white British people in the second wave even after adjustments,” according to the ONS. Although the ONS data does not cover the whole of the pandemic, there remains evidence that minority ethnic people were at a higher risk of contracting and dying from Covid-19 compared with their white counterparts.",News/World news,"What do we know about the 175,000 people who died of Covid in the UK?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/16/what-do-we-know-about-people-who-died-covid-uk
1/17/2022,"The Duke of Sussex believes the UK is too dangerous for him and his family to visit without state protection as it emerged he is taking legal action against the government to allow him to pay privately for police security while in Britain. Prince Harry lost taxpayer-funded police security when he and Meghan stepped back from royal duties in 2020. The couple pays for private security in the US, where they now live.  Harry is seeking a judicial review against a Home Office decision that prevents him personally paying for police protection for him and his family while in the UK. His legal representative said the duke’s private security team did not have adequate jurisdiction abroad or access to UK intelligence information required to protect him, his wife, and their children, Archie and Lilibet. They said the family had been subjected to “well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats”. Responding to reports, first published by the Mail on Sunday, the representative said prince, who filed for judicial review in September, was “unable to return to his home” because it was too dangerous. They added Harry had first offered to pay privately for Scotland Yard protection at the Sandringham summit in 2020, where senior royals and their aides met to hammer out the exit strategy for the Sussexes, but that his offer was dismissed. If the case progresses, it will lead to a high court battle between ministers and Harry, thought to be the first occasion in modern times when a member of the royal family has brought a case against Her Majesty’s government. The couple’s concerns follow an incident in London in 2021, when Harry returned to the UK for the unveiling of the statute of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and his car was reportedly chased by photographers as he left a charity event. Harry’s legal threat comes ahead of his grandmother’s platinum jubilee, and raises questions over whether he and his family will attend celebrations in the UK over the jubilee bank holiday weekend in June. A source said the Sussexes believed the UK threat level is particularly high, greater than that faced in the US, where not only can private security be deployed but where, they believe, law enforcement organisations are allowed to bemore supportive. The couple believe that in the UK the controversy surrounding their departure from full-time royal service, and the hostility of a range of extremist groups and fixated people, make the environment particularly risky. Harry will challenge the decision-making on the grounds it is unreasonable, opaque and inconsistent. A source said the decision had taken insufficient account of Harry’s position, undiminished threat and any impact on the UK’s reputation of a senior member of the royal family being harmed on UK soil. Harry is said to want himself and his family to be safe and to pay for necessary security, but he cannot unless the Home Office approves his offer. He believes his own private security cannot replicate the standard of security he believes he should receive from the state. “The UK will always be Prince Harry’s home and a country he wants his wife and children to be safe in,” his legal spokesperson said. “With the lack of police protection comes too great a personal risk.” “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex personally fund a private security team for their family, yet that security cannot replicate the necessary police protection needed whilst in the UK. In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable to return to his home.” “The duke first offered to pay personally for UK police protection for himself and his family in January of 2020 at Sandringham. That offer was dismissed. “He remains willing to cover the cost of security, so as not to impose on the British taxpayer. As is widely known, others who have left public office and have an inherent threat risk receive police protection at no cost to them. “The goal for Prince Harry has been simple – to ensure the safety of himself and his family while in the UK so his children can know his home country.” The representative said Harry was sixth in line to the throne, had served two tours of Afghanistan, and in recent years his family “has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats”.A government spokesperson said: “The UK government’s protective security system is rigorous and proportionate. It is our long-standing policy not to provide detailed information on those arrangements. To do so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals’ security. “It would also not be appropriate to comment on the detail of any legal proceedings.”",News/UK news,"UK too dangerous for us to visit, says Prince Harry",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/16/uk-too-dangerous-for-us-to-visit-says-prince-harry-meghan
1/17/2022,"It is January 2020. Donald Trump and Greta Thunberg are the star turns at the annual festival of globalisation organised by the World Economic Forum in Davos. The fossil-fuel loving president and the teenage environmentalist have a pop at each other. There are reports of a new virus emerging from China but Covid barely gets a mention. Much has happened since. For a second year running, Davos is not going ahead in person. US billionaires will not be parking their private jets at Zurich airport. The skies above the ski resort made famous by Thomas Mann in the Magic Mountain will not be thick with helicopters. Hotels will not be able to charge five times their normal rates for a captive audience of policy makers, business leaders, academics, campaigners, journalists and assorted hangers-on.  Let’s face it: few of us are going to miss being lectured about the need to tackle global heating from those with the biggest carbon footprints, or watching company bosses who do all they can to avoid paying tax shed crocodile tears about the lack of decent schools, skilled workers and public infrastructure. That said, the issues that were salient at the 2020 Davos have not gone away. In many respects, the trends have worsened in the past two years. Take inequality, where there has been a widening of the gap between rich and poor, both within countries and between them. The sort of people who attend Davos have been insulated from the worst of the pandemic and, in many cases, have actually prospered from it. Academics, journalists, PR consultants have all been able to work in relative safety at home while less well-remunerated frontline workers have put themselves at risk. Stimulus policies pursued by central banks – zero interest rates and quantitative easing – have put rocket boosters under asset prices. Poorer countries have had far less scope to stimulate their economies and have been squeezed out in the global race for vaccines. In the early stages of the pandemic, there was much talk about how the pandemic would bring people and countries together, but the opposite has been the case. In the UK, the mood has soured since the days when people stood on their doorsteps to clap for the NHS. In Europe and the US there have been vociferous, and sometimes violent, anti-vax protests. In the labour markets, there have been faint echoes of what happened after the Black Death in the mid-14th century. Back then shortages of workers caused by a much more deadly virus put upward pressure on wage rates. Lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 have had similar effects: firms – especially those in low-wage sectors – are having trouble recruiting and retaining staff, and have had no option but to raise pay rates. The risk of a wage-price spiral has alarmed some of the world’s leading central banks, including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, who feel – rightly – their credibility is at stake. With interest rates on their way back up, belief in the Goldilocks scenario (just enough tightening to reduce inflationary pressure but not so much as to halt recovery) is going to be put to the test this year. Clearly, there is a risk of the porridge in 2022 either being too hot, in which case inflation is longer lasting, or too cold, in which case there will be a global recession. The sharp contraction in the global economy in 2020 did not remove the threat posed by climate change, and those who would have turned up in Davos know it. Each year, global movers and shakers are asked by the WEF what they perceive to be the biggest long-term risks. Even though the world is still struggling with Covid, this year the top five issues identified were all linked to the environment. Action on climate change is being made more difficult because the crisis has made countries more domestically focused. In part, that’s because disruptions to global supply chains have encouraged a drive for self-sufficiency, but there has also been a tendency for governments to look after their own, self-defeating though this will prove to be. Vaccine apartheid is a classic example of the lack of international solidarity, but there are other worrying trends too. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have warned repeatedly that more and more countries are struggling with unpayable debts, to little effect. A new debt crisis is about to erupt, amplifying the impact of the pandemic. As the Bank’s president David Malpass noted last week, before the pandemic on average 53% of 10-year-olds in the world’s poorest countries were unable to read a simple story. The figure is now 70%. Any hopes that the departure of Trump from the White House would lead to a de-escalation of geopolitical tension have proved groundless. Joe Biden has proved to be just as hawkish towards China as his predecessor, while relations between the west and Russia are as bad as they have been since the end of the Cold War. The collapse of communism was supposed to usher in an era in which free markets and democracy would spread around the world, but the golden age of globalisation lasted barely 15 years. The World Trade Organization – the symbol of the new world order – is moribund, while authoritarian leaders are back in vogue. The end of history thesis proved to be wildly overblown. The plan is that Davos will still take place, in the late spring when the Omicron wave has abated, and if it happens there will be plenty to discuss. How many members of the usual crowd show up once the snow has melted remains to be seen. We have had peak globalisation; we’ve also had peak Davos.",News/Business,"The Davos razzmatazz is gone, but the issues are more urgent than ever | Larry Elliott",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/16/the-davos-razzmatazz-is-gone-but-the-issues-are-more-urgent-than-ever
1/17/2022,"A British arm of the camera company Canon will this year become one of the latest businesses to trial a four-day working week with no loss of pay, as part of a six-month trial run by academics at the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. The trial comes amid growing interest from businesses around the world in the potential benefits of giving workers an extra day off. The pilot programme will be run in conjunction with Cambridge and Oxford academics alongside Boston College, the 4 Day Week Campaign and the thinktank Autonomy.  Six companies have joined so far for a pilot, which is scheduled to begin in June, although the researchers hope to attract between 20 and 30 businesses in total. The Edinburgh-based Canon Medical Research Europe will trial the four-day week among its 140 employees. It develops medical and artificial intelligence software, and its parent company is a member of Japan’s Nikkei 225 index. Ken Sutherland, the president of Canon Medical Research Europe, said: “We recognise that working patterns and the focus we all give to our work-life balance has changed substantially during the pandemic. As a responsive employer we are always looking at how we can adapt our working practices to ensure that employees find their time with us is meaningful, fulfilling and productive. For this reason, we’re keen to pilot a four-day week to see if it can work for us.” The UK companies taking part are also understood to include software firms and a medical not-for-profit, and range in size from about 20 staff to several with more than 100. The four-day week, reducing standard hours by a fifth but with no loss of pay, has been gaining ground in recent years after some businesses have reported counter-intuitive benefits, such as increased productivity and improved staff retention – reducing a major cost especially for industries that usually have high employee turnover. The app-based Atom Bank announced in November it would move permanently to a four-day week, with most employees likely to have a three-day weekend as standard. Another Japanese technology company, Panasonic, this year said it would trial optional four-day weeks. Other large companies looking at the four-day week include Unilever, the maker of consumer goods ranging from Marmite to Dove soap. It has extended a trial for some workers in New Zealand until June because of the recent lockdowns. The UK supermarket chain Morrisons hassaid it would introduce the measure for employees at its Bradford headquarters. Pilot schemes are already taking place in Spain, Ireland and the US, and a trial in Scotland was announced last year by the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell was a prominent advocate, and one of his staffers set up the UK campaign. The Glasgow-based Pursuit Marketing has had a four-day week for all staff since 2016. Lorraine Gray, its chief operating officer, said the work pattern continued to be a success for the business, with productivity about 30% higher than before – more than making up for the lost day. “It focuses the mind,” she said. “For anybody in the workplace, there’s always points in your day when you could be more productive.” There’s no more “Mondaymorningitis” sick days, she added. Staff turnover has remained low, and there have been mental health benefits. Pursuit has expanded since 2018, when the Guardian first spoke to Gray, and it played a role in running call centres seven-days a week for Scotland’s test and protect contact-tracing system during the pandemic. One of the British academics studying the pilot will be Brendan Burchell, a professor in the social sciences at Cambridge University whose work has focused on issues such as the relationship between unemployment and wellbeing and the effects of “flexible” working on UK workers. He said: “With the social and environmental benefits of the shorter working week becoming clearer, grassroots support more widespread, and technology available to maintain productivity, the time has come for more organisations to take the leap and unravel the practicalities.”",Lifestyle/Money,Canon’s UK arm to become latest company to trial four-day week,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/16/canon-uk-arm-trial-four-day-week-pilot-shorter-working
