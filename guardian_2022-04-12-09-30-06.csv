4/12/2022,"Almost one in six people around the world have a headache on any given day, with about half of those experiencing a migraine, researchers have found. Headache disorders can be painful and debilitating and have myriad causes, from stress to over-use of medications such as painkillers. Now a large scale review has highlighted just how common such conditions are. “Headaches are really, really frequent disorders, [and] very prevalent in all countries – although there may be differences,” said Prof Lars Jacob Stovner, first author of the research from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Stovner and colleagues identified 357 papers published between 1961 and the end of 2020. While these covered different countries, different time periods and often used different approaches, the team were able to analyse the data to explore the prevalence of headache disorders around the world. The results, published in the Journal of Headache and Pain, suggest more than half of the world’s population – 52% – have an active headache disorder, typically described as experiencing some type of headache during the past year. Further analysis revealed that just under 16% of people around the world had a headache on any given day. While many of the studies did not report the type of headache involved, those that did suggested about 7% of the global population experience migraine on any given day, and almost 9% experience a tension-type headache. The review also highlighted that the prevalence of headache disorders differed by sex, with 17% of women affected by migraine in a given year, compared with 8.6% of men. Headaches for 15 or more days a month were also much more common in women. Stovner said the overall findings chime with previous estimates of headache prevalence, including the Global Burden of Disease study. However, the study suggests migraines may have become more common since the team’s last review in 2007 – a finding the authors note is not conclusive, as it may be down to factors such as, for example, more sensitive diagnostic questionnaires. They add that apparent differences between countries are also speculative as the findings may depend upon how the studies are carried out. Stovner’s team previously revealed that migraine was the leading cause of disability for under-50s,. “Many other pains in the body, they are increasing when we approach retirement. But migraines and headaches are most prevalent in the most active years,” said Stovner, who works with the Global Campaign against Headache. Stovner added that headache disorders can be down to multiple factors, from an individual’s genetics to stress, sleep problems and overuse of medication, adding that options are available to both prevent headache disorders or treat them when they occur. “This is something the health services have to take seriously. We must inform the public, the decision makers, the health services … about this very big public health problem,” he said. Peter Goadsby, professor of neurology at King’s College London and an expert in migraine, who was not involved in the research, said conditions such as migraine were disabling and horrible for those who experience them, adding that there needed to be not only more recognition of headache but also action. “We need more treatments and, frankly, Europe just needs the treatments now available in the US for a starter,” he said, adding there also needs to be investment in research. “Research council investment is pitiful and embarrassing when you think it is the migraineurs who [are] a good chunk of current taxpayers.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Headaches: are you one of the one in six people suffering today?,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/12/headaches-are-you-one-of-the-one-in-six-people-suffering-today
4/12/2022,"The forest wraps the coast of Christchurch’s peninsula, carpets of pine needles giving way to a bright shard of green from the ocean. Nestled in the golden needles, Dylan Parker finds his prize: a cluster of dusty-brown slippery jack mushrooms, barely visible at first glance, hollow-sounding when tapped – perfect for eating. He gives them a quick slap to release the spores, trims them of their dirt, and slots them into his basket, where the ingredients of dinner are slowly accumulating. In New Zealand, where inflation and price increases have sent food prices sky-high, increasing numbers of people are turning to foraging to supplement the contents of their pantries. Communities map out fruit and nut trees, alert one another to upcoming windfalls, develop a working knowledge of edible weeds, and teach themselves to distinguish a tasty birch bolete mushroom from a poisonous lookalike. In some locations, the competition can grow fierce. Foragers reluctant to give away their prized porcini mushroom spots will rustle stealthily through the leaf litter, trying to conceal their intentions. “You’ll see these old guys, and they won’t even tell you what they’re doing,” laughs Parker, a basket of mushrooms slung over his arm. “They’re like, ‘Oh, I’ve just lost a ring!’ holding a bag full of lumps.” Foraging is popular in Christchurch, the largest city of the South Island, where devastating earthquakes in 2010 and 2011 saw large chunks of the city demolished. A decade later, gaps remain, like knocked out teeth in the skyline’s smile. In some of those gaps, nature has taken over, and wild rabbits run through empty lots. The red zone, a sprawling expanse that ribbons from the coastline to the inner city, was designated too unstable to rebuild upon, and 8,000 houses were demolished or removed. They have left behind a surreal tangle of abandoned cul de sacs, cracking footpaths, expanding meadows and gardens left to go wild. Demolition teams opted to leave the trees, and now the zone plays host to thousands of fruiting trees and vines. It is a favourite for foragers. “It started with us exploring the red zone, before the houses were pulled down,” says Sandi Galvin, who has brought her three-year-old son Leon, out food-gathering. “We realised how many fruit trees and things were being left behind, and it turned from urban exploring into fruit collection and nut collection.” They now gather apples and pears, grapes, feijoas, walnuts, the occasional lucky haul of apricots. Beside her, Leon proudly brandishes a porcini mushroom. “Doesn’t smell poisonous,” he proclaims. (Galvin, a horticulturist, advises caution eating wild mushrooms unless you are absolutely sure of their safety.) Over time, she says foraging has been a fun activity for their family, but also a way to keep food bills down. “If you have a toddler, you know they’re wee apple munchers,” she says. “I can’t believe the cost of apples.” In February, New Zealand’s food prices were up 6.8% from the previous year, the largest increase in a decade. Fruit and vegetables have been particularly high – up 15% year-on-year in January. In March, shoppers were reporting that blocks of cheddar cheese had reached $20 a kilogram, and a head of cauliflower could set you back a cool $15. This week, a survey of 1600 customers by Westpac NZ found 83% were worried about rising prices for food and other household essentials. The anxiety was particularly prevalent among younger New Zealanders, at nearly 90% for those under 35. “There’s growing competition,” says Galvin. “When we first started collecting stuff and foraging, you’d be lucky to see one person out doing the same thing – over the years, it’s just steadily become more popular.” Joanna Wildish knows the red zone well by now: she began foraging in earnest around the time of earthquakes, and the abandonment of the red zone coincided with tight budgets for their household. “We were really keen on finding free sources of food and resources within the city – we were struggling financially and really wanted to just see what was out there,” she says. “So [we] started with things like collecting pine cones, and looking in local parks for pears and apples and walnuts and all kinds of things like that.” Wildish founded Ōtautahi Urban Foraging group, where people exchange tips for ripe fruit crops, locations for productive trees, and recipes for foraged foods. She says it was “formed to help relieve the stress of poverty.” Over time, she’s seen numbers grow significantly – not only in the group itself, but also the number of people she sees out and about gathering food. “It’s amazing how much it’s grown – and I wonder whether that’s out of necessity for a lot of people,” she says. As well as an economic necessity, foragers say gathering food is also a source of pleasure – a way to encounter fruits and vegetables in their natural stomping ground, to develop a stronger sense of connection to place and season. It’s also a way to reclaim food from the alienated states in which we often encounter it: chilled, cling-filmed, polystyrene wrapped or reconstituted beyond recognition. There’s pleasure and excitement in noticing the grassy flavour of a fresh, undried walnut, the dark, earthy odour of a mushroom pulled from under the birch leaves, the sweet aniseed taste of pollen from a wild fennel flower. “Being in touch with the seasons, is a really powerful thing that you gain from foraging,” says Dylan. “Because you can’t go to the supermarket out here and pick tomatoes at any time of the year. Things are ripe when they’re ripe, and everything has a season.” “High quality food is now quite inaccessible for most people, I think. But you can come out here and pick yourself most nutrient dense salad.” After an hour walking around the peninsula, his basket is full: mushrooms, miner’s lettuce, mallow, wild parsley and fennel. Most meals that he eats now have foraged ingredients to them. “I think a lot of people are catching on to that,” he says. “I’m noticing the effect on spots where I do forage and seeing more traffic from more people – it’s something that I find really exciting. I love having more and more foragers out. I think there’s always enough for everyone.”",News/World news,Foraging takes hold in New Zealand’s wild places,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/foraging-takes-hold-in-new-zealands-wild-places
4/12/2022,"The focus of Japan’s quest to open its first casino is a human-made island in Osaka that, if the city’s government gets its way, will end decades of wrangling over the country’s fraught relationship with poker tables and slot machines. On a recent weekday morning there was little to suggest that Yumeshima – “Dream Island” – could, by the end of the decade, be the site of an unprecedented experiment with gambling in the world’s third biggest economy. A stream of trucks disappear into an undersea tunnel taking them to the island, while boats laden with soil plough the strip of water separating it from the mainland. From a distance, Yumeshima looks more like a sprawling building site than the possible location for Japan’s answer to Macau or Las Vegas. Six years after the government legalised casino development, Osaka is vying with nearby Wakayama and the central city of Nagoya to open Japan’s first “integrated resort” – a ¥1tn (£6bn) complex of hotels, conference and entertainment facilities, with a casino as its money-spinning centrepiece. The western Japanese city is now considered the frontrunner after the local assembly, where the rightwing populist Osaka Ishin no Kai is the strongest party, recently approved a bid that will be sent to the central government by the 28 April deadline. The envisaged resort will “be an engine of sustainable economic growth for Osaka and the region,” Osaka’s mayor, Ichiro Matsui, told assembly members. He has an ally in the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, who said integrated resorts were the “key to Japan’s efforts to become a leading tourism nation” when it finally reopens to overseas visitors locked out during the coronavirus pandemic. But despite campaigning in local elections on a pro-casino platform, Matsui and his allies are facing a backlash from citizens’ groups concerned about the cost of developing Yumeshima, which was built on reclaimed land during the boom years of the 1970s, and the casino’s potential to become a magnet for organised crime and gambling addiction. The city’s assembly has received more than 100 petitions demanding that the casino plan be abandoned or at least put to a referendum, a move it has so far resisted. Critics point to the city’s decision to make taxpayers bear ¥79bn at the request of the resort’s prospective operators, MGM Resorts International and the Japanese financial services group Orix, towards the cost of protecting Yumeshima against soil liquefaction. Foreign casino operators have spent years lobbying Japanese authorities for access to a market that could generate huge profits, estimated by some analysts at $20bn a year, if three casinos are built. Despite the long ban on casinos, Japan is a nation of keen gamblers: horse, speedboat, motorcycle and keirin bicycle racing together bring in the equivalent of billions of dollars a year, while pachinko, a pinball-like game, generated ¥14.6tn in sales in 2020, according to the Japan Productivity Centre’s leisure white paper. But there is a downside. A 2017 study by the health ministry found that about 3.2 million people – about 3.6% of the adult population – were thought to be addicted to gambling, far higher than the 1.2% in France, for example. The high rate of addiction is largely blamed on pachinko, in which players get around strict gambling laws by exchanging prizes or tokens for cash off the premises. Teruo Sakurada, a professor at Hannan University in Osaka, believes the central government will reject Osaka’s bid owing to “irregularities” in its application. “This is all about money for the operator and the Japanese firms involved in building and running the resort,” said Sakurada, who heads a group campaigning to scrap the Yumeshima casino plan. “Local companies have lost a lot of their power and influence in recent years, and this is a way for them to reassert themselves and divvy up the profits among themselves.” Polls by media organisations show that about 60% of Japanese oppose casino construction. In an attempt to address concerns that the resorts will create a new generation of gambling addicts, only three sites will receive operating licences. Japanese nationals will have to pay a ¥6,000 admission fee and be limited to up to 10 visits a month. In addition, each casino will occupy no more than 3% of the resort’s total area. “What I object to most is that these casinos are aimed mainly at Japanese people,” said Sakurada, whose group has called for a local referendum on the Yumeshima project, confident that a majority of the city’s residents will vote it down. “If the casino is built, they will have to pay for the land to be developed, and they will continue to pay in other ways, such as a rise in gambling addiction.” Joji Kokuryo, the managing director of the Tokyo-based casino industry consultancy Bay City Ventures, conceded that there were no guarantees the central government would approve the casino applications, despite their potential economic benefits as “tourism gateways”. “Integrated resorts will bring more opportunities for local economies by simply attracting more visitors, employment and business opportunities, while also leading to indirect and induced benefits for the economy,” Kokuryo said. The casino cause was not helped last year when Tsukasa Akimoto, then a deputy minister in charge of tourism and casino promotions, was sentenced to four years in prison for taking millions of yen in bribes from a Chinese gambling operator that was hoping to start a casino business in Japan. Osaka and its rivals will be keen to learn from the experience of Yokohama, whose former pro-casino mayor pushed ahead with an integrated resort bid despite public opposition, only to be voted out in favour of a candidate who promptly ditched the city’s casino ambitions. “If the Yokohama story has taught us anything, some form of local consent, either through elections or referendums, look to be a necessary step for integrated resort development to start on the right foot,” Kokuryo said.",News/World news,Backlash in Osaka as ‘Dream Island’ leads race to open Japan’s first casino,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/japan-first-casino-osaka-backlash-gambling
