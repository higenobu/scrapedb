3/9/2022,"The first foreign fighters have arrived in Ukraine amid heavy Russian bombardment and are on the battlefield, Ukraine military officials tell Military Times. This marks the first time the unit has been used, Ukraine Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of that nation’s defense intelligence agency, told Military Times Monday afternoon. Late last month, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy created “The International Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine,” as a global appeal for foreigners to come to the aid of his country. “The first groups are already in the battlefield,” said another Ukraine official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to explain the situation. “A new group goes to the combat area every day.” They have arrived from the U.S., U.K., Sweden, Lithuania, Mexico, India and other countries, said the official. Volunteer fighters arrive in Ukraine. But the untrained should stay home The official did not know all the tasks they are performing, but said some are defending Kyiv. “It is difficult to speak with them as they are in the combat area,” the official said, estimating that worldwide, about 20,000 people have expressed interest in volunteering. Last week, a Ukrainian defense official in Washington D.C. said about 3,000 Americans expressed interest, including many veterans. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby urged Americans to stay home. “I don’t have an estimate of Americans who might want to be volunteering to go there,” he said. “I would say what I said last week, if you’re an American and you want to do right by Ukraine, the best thing you can do is find a way to donate to so many agencies that are trying to deal with what is now clearly a humanitarian crisis in the region, and certainly there in Ukraine. We still do not believe that Ukraine is a safe place for Americans to go. We urge them not to go and if any are still there, we urge them to leave.” The U.S. State Department also recommends citizens not travel to Ukraine. Russia’s war on Ukraine, now in its 12th day, has seen the invading forces slowed, but Ukraine’s cities are experiencing a devastating barrage of aircraft and missile strikes. This is an effort to help shore up Ukrainian forces. Want to go fight for Ukraine? Here’s what to do. No volunteers will be allowed to bring their own weapons, a Ukrainian official told Military Times last week. Those who fight will be issued at least rifles, he added. He would not comment on whether they will be issued other types of weapons. Ukraine officials stress to Military Times that they are looking for foreign volunteers with combat experience who require little training before being armed and sent to the front line. The instructions for joining the legion require “documents confirming military service or work with law enforcement agencies and participation in combat.” “We are asking for trained people to come,” said the official in Ukraine. “We don’t have time for training.”",World/Air Force Times,Foreign fighters now on battlefield helping battle Russia: Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/foreign-fighters-now-battlefield-helping-214733078.html
3/9/2022,"Russia’s military operation in Ukraine will be “unsustainable” within three weeks, a defence expert has said. Ed Arnold, a research fellow for European security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, said Russia is meeting more resistance from Ukrainian troops than it expected. He told the Reuters news agency on Monday: “At the current rate of Russian losses, which are not confirmed, but we do have indications that this operation would be unsustainable within about three weeks from the Russian perspective.” He added: “In which case that they would have to consolidate the gains already made and look to see a way of trying to freeze the conflict on the current lines of advance while they mobilise more forces from Russia.” While Arnold said Russia continues its advance into Ukraine, he described its progress as “slow”. He said: “Within the north, they are still looking to fully encircle Kyiv. “In the south, the Russian advance is continued to be slow but they're seeing a lot more successes in the south, taking Kherson and consolidating and pushing further west, and then also focusing now on Mariupol. “However, at the moment, the Russian operation is going so badly, especially from logistics point of view that really Russia might just not have the numbers to make another conflict that is cold be hot again."" His comments came as Ukraine claimed on Monday it had retaken the city of Chuhuiv from Russian troops. Lieutenant General Serhiy Shaptala said defending Ukrainian forces had seized Chuhuiv from Russian control, killing two high-ranking Russian commanders in the process. Ukraine’s military, the General Staff, said on Facebook: ""In the course of hostilities, the city of Chuhuiv was liberated.

The discussions will take place in Belarus, close to the border with Poland. In the previous set of talks last Thursday, it was agreed to set up humanitarian corridors to allow refugees to flee Ukraine. But proposed ceasefire attempts in the city of Mariupol collapsed at the weekend. Russia announced new humanitarian corridors on Monday, but Ukraine branded the plans “immoral” as they would lead refugees straight into the arms of Russia and its close ally, Belarus. Meanwhile, the mayor of the Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv claimed that Russians dropped cluster bombs on residential buildings and a zoo on Monday morning. Russia issued a list of demands on Monday, saying Ukraine must follow four criteria for its invasion to stop. These included ceasing military action; changing its constitution to enshrine neutrality; acknowledging Crimea as Russian territory and recognising the separatist republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as independent territories.",World/Yahoo News UK,Russia operation in Ukraine 'will be unsustainable within three weeks',https://news.yahoo.com/russia-operation-ukraine-unsustainable-war-153037343.html
