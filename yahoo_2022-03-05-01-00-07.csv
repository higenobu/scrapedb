3/5/2022,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday issued a dire appeal for help as Russia's attacks across the country intensified. ""The end of the world has arrived,"" Zelensky said during a televised news conference in Kyiv. He appealed to Western leaders who have resisted calls to set up a no-fly zone over Ukraine. ""If you do not have the power to close the skies, then give me planes,"" Zelensky said. The Ukrainian leader also called for direct negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Good Lord, what do you want? Leave our land. If you don't want to leave now, sit down with me at the negotiating table. But not from 30 meters away, like with [French President Emmanuel] Macron and [German Chancellor Olaf] Scholz,” Zelensky said, according to a translation from journalist Max Seddon, the Financial Times’ Moscow bureau chief. The “30 meters” line appears to be a reference to the lengthy table Putin uses for meetings with foreign leaders and his own advisers. “Sit down with me and talk. What are you afraid of? We're no threat to anyone,” Zelensky added. His comments came one week after Putin ordered a military invasion of Ukraine. Russia has since stepped up its assault on key cities after an attempt by its forces to encircle the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, appeared to stall. The New York Times reported Wednesday that Russian troops had seized Kherson, capturing their first major Ukrainian city since the start of the invasion. Zelensky's office denied the report, saying the battle for the port city was ongoing. Battles continue to rage in other Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv and Kharkiv, the two largest population centers, as outnumbered Ukrainian troops mount a ferocious response that has been aided by ordinary citizens wielding Molotov cocktails. Ukrainian and Russian delegations were expected to meet Thursday for a second round of talks in Belarus, but there appeared to be no end to the invasion in sight. Zelensky vowed to continue defending the nation while pleading with NATO countries to help.

3/5/2022,"Ukrainian defense forces killed Russian Maj. Gen. Andrei Sukhovetsky in combat earlier this week, according to Ukrainian officials and Russian media. The circumstances of the 47-year-old’s death were not immediately clear, but the Kremlin-backed Pravda said he was killed ""during a special operation in Ukraine."" According to Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency, Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed Sukhovetsky deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army of the Central Military District last year. He was also the head of the 7th Airborne Division, had served in Syria and received two commendations for bravery from the Kremlin. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES ""The fact is, we killed him,"" Volodymyr Omelyan, Ukraine’s former minister of infrastructure who has joined the militia in Kyiv, told Fox News Digital Thursday. The U.S. could not immediately confirm his death, according to a senior defense official. But multiple reports cited a post on the Russian VKontakte social media platform attributed to Sergei Chipilev, a member of a Russian military officers’ group. RUSSIAN TROOPS CLOSE IN ON UKRAINE'S LARGEST NUCLEAR POWER PLANT AS AUTHORITIES WARN OF POTENTIAL FOR CATASTROPHE ""With great pain, we learned the tragic news of the death of our friend, Major General Andrey Sukhovetsky, on the territory of Ukraine during the special operation,"" he wrote, according to a translation published by the English-language Russian outlet, Pravda.ru. ""We express our deepest condolences to his family."" The Kremlin maintains that its military presence in Ukraine is a ""special operation"" and not an invasion or war. But Russian troops have attacked targets across the country since entering from the north, east and south last week. Although Ukraine’s defenses are out-manned and outgunned, Western intelligence analysts have said they appear to have put up a stiffer resistance than Putin expected. ""If it’s true, it’s big,"" Dan Hoffman, a former CIA officer and station chief, said of Sukhovetsky’s death. ‘TO THE LAST BULLET’: UKRAINIANS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE ANSWER THE CALL, TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST RUSSIA It could fortify the Ukrainian military’s steadfast resolve and represents a tactical victory. A massive Russian military convoy appears to have stalled outside Kyiv for days, bogged down by logistical problems and Ukraine’s military. But Putin’s troops have seized Kherson, a port city of almost 300,000. They were also shelling Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, and bombarding defense forces in Mariupol, another waterfront hub. Russian troops also said they seized the area around Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhya, near the riverside city of Enerhodar. Reports say the facility is on fire. A successful campaign across Ukraine’s coastal southern region could create a land bridge for Russian forces between the homeland and Crimea, which they have occupied since 2014. It would also cut off Ukraine from maritime shipping. Russia reported Wednesday morning that it had lost 498 troops. Ukrainian officials claim that number to be as high as 9,000 – but they have not released figures of their own casualties.

3/5/2022,"By Peter Eisler WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than a half dozen U.S. Secret Service officers on Thursday took two men into custody from a car in Washington's Georgetown neighborhood and removed what seemed to be an assault-style rifle from the vehicle, a Reuters witness said. The two men were handcuffed and separated, according to the Reuters reporter who witnessed the incident. The witness said the officers also pulled what appeared to be body armor components from the car. The vehicle was a black four-door Ford sedan with Indiana plates that said Marine Corps Veteran. The Washington Post reported that the two arrested men told police they had driven from Indiana to volunteer to fight in the war in Ukraine. The spot from where they were arrested was near the Ukrainian embassy in Georgetown. The Secret Service and Washington police did not respond to a request for comment on the newspaper report. A Secret Service spokesperson told Reuters that the two individuals were ""acting suspiciously"" near the vehicle in the area of Wisconsin Avenue and M Street, Northwest, and were arrested for possession of illegal weapons. The spokesperson did not elaborate further. One of the suspects wore tan pants and a black hoodie, while the other wore a camouflage-style jacket and a baseball cap, according to the witness and photographs from the scene. The Secret Service, which provides protection for the president, vice president and their families, said the arrested individuals, whose identities were not disclosed, were transported to a Washington police department facility for processing. A law enforcement official told Reuters that there was no information to suggest that there was any danger or threat to any of the protectees of the Secret Service. The Secret Service's website says the agency had 41 people under its protection in fiscal 2020. The incident occurred in the heart of Georgetown, an upscale neighborhood of shops and homes popular with tourists. The area is also home to many current and former government officials. Police removed multiple military-style bags from the car, like duffles and packs, mostly Army green, and emptied their contents on the trunk and the street, video from the incident showed. Some items, including what appeared to be body armor plates, were laid on the ground and photographed by officers.

3/5/2022,"Simon & Garfunkel once described a scenario in which ""friends just can't be found,"" and one can easily imagine that, following Wednesday's United Nations vote condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin and company might find solace in listening to ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" on repeat. According to The New York Times, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning Russian aggression, with 141 countries voting in favor, 34 abstaining, and only five voting against. The result matched the international outpouring of support for Ukraine seen around the world in the past week. Pro-Ukraine demonstrations sprang up in London, Madrid, Milan, Paris, Tokyo, Seoul, Cape Town, and several other cities. During President Biden's State of the Union address on Tuesday, many lawmakers waved small Ukrainian flags or wore Ukrainian flag pins. The no votes on the resolution came from five authoritarian nations: Russia, North Korea, Eritrea, Syria, and Russia's close ally Belarus. The Cato Institute's 2020 Human Freedom Index ranks Russia as the 115th freest country on earth. Belarus barely cracks the top 100 at 99th. Syria appears on the list as the 10th least free country in the world. North Korea and Eritrea, both one-party dictatorships, are not ranked at all. Among the nations that abstained from the vote were Iraq, Iran, India, Pakistan, and China. In early February, China and Russia released a joint statement that, among other things, condemned NATO expansion but did not directly mention Ukraine.

3/5/2022,"The mega-mansion known as ""The One"" sold Thursday for $126 million at a bankruptcy auction. That's a huge discount from its $295-million listing price, even with a 12% auction fee bringing the total to about $141 million. The Bel-Air property set a record for the costliest house sold at auction, but it fell well short of the California sales record set by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who purchased a Malibu estate for $177 million in October. The most ever spent on a U.S. residence was $238 million by hedge fund mogul Ken Griffin for a New York City penthouse in 2019. Several international sales have surpassed $300 million. The buyer will be disclosed by March 8, when paperwork must be submitted to U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Deborah Saltzman, who will hold a hearing later this month on whether to approve the sale. It is possible that the winning bidder will be a limited liability company, a legal entity often used by the wealthy to hide their real estate purchases. More than three dozen prospective buyers toured the 944 Airole Way property over the last couple of months, including billionaires from the Middle East, Asia and California, The One's listing agents have said. Concierge Auctions, which handled the sale, said its auction site drew views from 170 countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy — and generated some 2,800 prospects. However, after the online auction opened Monday, only five bidders from the United States and New Zealand participated. Most of the action occurred in the last few minutes. Agent Brent Chang of Compass said the results were a cautionary tale and might prompt builders to think smaller, given that multiple huge mansions have gone into bankruptcy in the last few years. He also wondered if the timing was off given Russia's invasion of Ukraine. “The buyer pool for this is very small, and with everything happening in Russia, all of a sudden those Russian billionaires who may have been your best bet to buy it are pulling out,” he said. The amount of debt attached to the property originally totaled about $180 million but has since grown to $256 million as more creditors have made claims, according to a March 2 court filing. That means many creditors will take losses — even though most of the auction house's 12% fee will be returned to the bankrupt estate, which is not a typical arrangement. The largest single creditor is Los Angeles billionaire Don Hankey, who lent $106 million to the dream project of developer Nile Niami. The lender says he is owed more than $130 million in secured debt, including money he provided in bankruptcy to repair and spiff up the property for sale. Hankey, who previously said he might bid for the property if it was severely underpriced at the auction, said he did not make an offer. He said the sale should allow him to recover the cash he put into the project, but added that he was surprised at how low the final price was. ""The guy who bought it just got a great deal. He's got people willing to pay $50,000 a day just to do commercials and films,"" Hankey said. The hilltop home, said to be 105,000 square feet, was marketed for $500 million several years ago while under construction but didn't find a buyer. It was placed into bankruptcy in October after Hankey foreclosed on the $106 million in debt defaulted on by Crestlloyd, the limited liability company established by Niami that legally owns the project. Turnaround specialist Lawrence Perkins, who was put in charge of Crestlloyd when the home was placed into bankruptcy, said the ""market spoke"" at the auction. However, he also said it was his responsibility to continue fielding late offers that might top the auction price. ""I've got an obligation if someone comes in, and there's a better offer. We're not soliciting them but it's not closed until it's closed,"" he said. ""Some people don't want to participate in auctions."" Broker Stephen Shapiro, the founding partner of Westside Estate Agency, said the low price reflected the ""out-of-control ego"" of Niami, who built a huge house that wasn't really a home. ""Most builders build a house that people can live in,"" he said. ""He built one thinking there was going to be demand for this outrageous over-the-top house."" Niami has been attempting to regain control of the property. In December, he proposed creating a cryptocurrency called The One Coin that would be backed by the mansion and pay off all the home’s debts. Prior to the auction, a Niami spokesperson said the developer would not be commenting on the auction. He could not be reached for immediate comment Thursday. The One is just the latest L.A. trophy home to end up in bankruptcy after a blitz of costly development in the region's glitzy hillside and coastal communities. Concierge Auctions last year set an auction record when it sold a Beverly Park home for $51 million — but that was still more than $100 million off its original asking price. Concierge said The One was the largest home ever sold at auction. How much The One would go for had been something of a parlor game in the luxury real estate community, with some thinking it is the ultimate trophy home and others declaring it a white elephant. The property includes a 4,000-square-foot guesthouse, a sky deck with cabanas, a private theater, a full-service spa, a nightclub and even an outdoor running track and moat. It has 21 bedrooms and 42 full bathrooms. However, the mansion could end up being a project for the buyer. The house isn’t 100% complete and lacks a certificate of occupancy, pending a sign-off from city inspectors on crucial permits for grading, electrical and other work. Also, it could have construction defects and zoning code violations, according to allegations in court documents. The mansion was described on the Concierge website as the “largest in the urban world,” but by many accounts, a 27-story home said to be 400,000 square feet owned by a billionaire in Mumbai, India, is considered the world’s largest, outside of royal palaces. However, it may be the largest in the country. Under the terms of the auction agreement, the winning bidder is under legal obligation to close the sale by the end of the month or lose a $250,000 deposit. In making her determination whether to approve the deal, the judge will consider whether she believes the high bidder has the financial wherewithal to close the sale, its impact on creditors and other issues. Other big creditors include Inferno Investment, a company run by Julien Remillard, a longtime Canadian investor of Niami’s. Inferno says it is owed $24 million. Yogi Securities, the investment vehicle of Joseph Englanoff, an L.A. doctor and another longtime Niami investor, says it is owed $14 million. Compass agent Bret Parsons said that he thought the price more reflected the value of the hilltop property, with its commanding views across the city, than the house itself. ""It's unfortunate that Mother Nature's valuable resources can be plundered for ridiculous trophies,"" he said. — Times staff writer Jack Flemming contributed to this report.

3/5/2022,"By Maher Chmaytelli DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman said he does not care whether U.S. President Joe Biden misunderstood things about him, saying Biden should be focusing on America's interests, in an interview with The Atlantic monthly published on Thursday. Since Biden took office in January 2021, the long-standing strategic partnership between Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, and Washington has come under strain over Riyadh's human rights record, especially with respect to the Yemen war and the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Prince Mohammed, the de facto Saudi ruler widely known as MbS, suggested in separate but related remarks carried by the Saudi state news agency SPA that Riyadh could choose to reduce investments in the United States, ""Simply, I do not care,” the crown prince said when asked by The Atlantic whether Biden misunderstood things about him. He said it was up to Biden ""to think about the interests of America"". “We don’t have the right to lecture you in America,” he added. “The same goes the other way.” The Biden administration released a U.S. intelligence report implicating the crown prince in the murder of Khashoggi, which MbS denies, and pressed for the release of political prisoners. The crown prince told The Atlantic that he felt his own rights had been violated by the accusations against him in the brutal murder and dismemberment of Khashoggi, who was killed inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate. ""I feel that human rights law wasn’t applied to me...Article XI of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that any person is innocent until proven guilty,” he said. Khashoggi's murder tarnished the reformist image that the crown prince had been cultivating in the West, which largely condemned him. MbS has wanted to return the focus to social and economic reforms that he has pushed through to open up Saudi Arabia and diversify its oil-dependent economy. They do not appear to include wide political reform. Asked whether Saudi rule could transform into a constitutional monarchy, MbS said no. “Saudi Arabia is based on pure monarchy,” he said. Prince Mohammed also told The Atlantic that Riyadh's objective was to maintain and strengthen its ""long, historical"" relationship with America. He said Saudi investments in the United States amounted to $800 billion. ""In the same way we have the possibility of boosting our interests, we have the possibility of reducing them,"" SPA quoted him as saying. While the crown prince enjoyed close relations with Biden's predecessor Donald Trump, Biden has taken a tougher stance with the Gulf Arab powerhouse and has so far chosen only to speak with King Salman bin Abdulaziz, not MbS. The Biden administration has also prioritised an end to the Yemen war, where a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement for seven years. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.

3/5/2022,"(Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the weekend that his nation's nuclear forces should be put on high alert, raising fears that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could lead to nuclear escalation. Here is how Russia's chain of command would work in the event of a nuclear weapon launch. WHO DECIDES TO LAUNCH RUSSIAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS? A 2020 document https://archive.mid.ru/en/web/guest/foreign_policy/international_safety/disarmament/-/asset_publisher/rp0fiUBmANaH/content/id/4152094 called ""Basic Principles of State Policy of the Russian Federation on Nuclear Deterrence"" says the Russian president takes the decision to use nuclear weapons. A small briefcase, known as the Cheget, is kept close to the president at all times, linking him to the command and control network of Russia's strategic nuclear forces. The Cheget does not contain a nuclear launch button but rather transmits launch orders to the central military command - the General Staff. IF PUTIN GIVES THE NUCLEAR ORDER, WHAT HAPPENS? The Russian General Staff file:///C:/Users/8011323/Downloads/FOIR1588.pdf has access to the launch codes and has two methods of launching nuclear warheads. It can send authorisation codes to individual weapons commanders, who would then execute the launch procedures. There is also a back-up system, known as Perimetr, which allows the General Staff to directly initiate the launch of land-based missiles, bypassing all the immediate command posts. DID PUTIN'S 'HIGH ALERT' ORDER MAKE A LAUNCH MORE LIKELY? Putin said at the weekend that the nation's nuclear forces should be put on high alert. The following day, Russia's defence ministry announced that its nuclear missile forces had been placed on ""enhanced"" combat duty. The phrase enhanced, or special, combat duty does not appear in Russia's nuclear doctrine, leaving military experts puzzled over what it might mean. Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva, said on Twitter that the order might have activated Russia's nuclear command and control system, essentially opening communication channels for any eventual launch order. Alternatively, he said it might just mean the Russians added staff to their nuclear facilities. DO THE RUSSIANS HAVE RULES ON NUCLEAR LAUNCHES? The 2020 doctrine presents four scenarios which might justify the use of Russian nuclear weapons: -- the use of nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction against Russia or its allies; -- data showing the launch of ballistic missiles aimed at Russia or its allies; -- an attack on critical government or military sites that would undermine the country's nuclear forces response actions; -- the use of conventional weapons against Russia ""when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy"". WHAT NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES DOES RUSSIA HAVE? The Federation of American Scientists https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces estimates that Russia has 5,977 nuclear warheads, more than any other country. Of these, 1,588 are deployed and ready for use. Its missiles can be fired from the land, by submarines and by airplanes. Putin oversaw a coordinated test of Russia's nuclear forces on Feb. 19 shortly before ordering troops into Ukraine. HAS RUSSIA EVER USED A NUCLEAR WEAPON IN WAR? No. To date, the only use of nuclear weapons during conflict was the atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States in 1945, at the end of World War Two.

Russian billionaire and banker, Mikhail Fridman, was locked out of the investment firm he cofounded after he was hit by European Union sanctions, the company announced on Wednesday. London-based LetterOne said in a press release that Fridman and Russian banker Petr Aven had stepped down from the company's board and will no longer have any dealings with the group. Fridman and Aven jointly own under 50% of LetterOne, so the company has avoided sanctions imposed on the two men. Chairman Mervyn Davies, who has now taken control of LetterOne, told the Financial Times that employees aren't allowed to speak to Fridman. LetterOne, founded in 2013, has also locked Fridman out of its offices and blocked him from having access to documents, Davies told the FT. Fridman's assets in the company were ""effectively frozen"" and his rights as a shareholder were taken away, LetterOne's press release said. He won't receive dividends, funds, or communications in any way, said LetterOne. A company spokesperson told Insider that Fridman has ""no involvement in the day-to-day management or decision-making of LetterOne and appropriate arrangements have been put in place to give effect to this."" LetterOne's actions came after the EU sanctioned Fridman as part of a package of responses to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Fridman is one of the many Russian oligarchs targeted by Western sanctions aimed at crippling Russia's economy. The board isn't obligated to give shareholder rights back to Fridman if the EU sanctions are lifted, according to LetterOne's press release. Fridman, who has a net worth of $10 billion according to Bloomberg, was one of the first Russian business leaders to speak out against the invasion of Ukraine. In a letter to LetterOne employees, Fridman said that ""war can never be the answer,"" and that ""this crisis will cost lives and damage two nations who have been brothers for hundreds of years."" LetterOne, which describes itself as ""an international investment business led by successful entrepreneurs and former CEOs and international businesspeople,"" held $22.3 billion in net assets as of 2020, according to its website.

3/5/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two-term U.S. Representative Van Taylor on Wednesday withdrew from a Republican primary run-off race, ending his reelection bid after admitting he had an extra-marital affair with the widow of an American who joined the Islamic State, according to media reports. Taylor, who represents a northeast Texas district, last year voted for the creation of a special congressional panel to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol, earning the ire of former President Donald Trump, whose supporters mounted the deadly attack. Taylor's withdrawal came one day after he led a pack of five Republicans in a primary race with 48.7% of the vote, just shy of the 50% needed to win his party's nomination. With his withdrawal, a former Texas county judge, Keith Self, became the Republican nominee who will run in the Nov. 8 general election for the seat representing an area north of Dallas, including Plano. The Dallas Morning News quoted Taylor telling supporters he had made ""a horrible mistake"" by engaging in the affair with the woman. Taylor's congressional office in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment or say whether he will serve out the remainder of his term.

 Retired Gen. David Petraeus believes Russia President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is not a war he can win due to inadequate troop numbers and fierce Ukrainian resistance. ""I don't think that this is a war, ultimately, that Russia and Vladimir Putin can win,"" Petraeus said Wednesday in an interview with CNN. ""They can take a city perhaps, but they cannot hold it."" Petraeus, a commander in U.S. insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan, said Russia doesn't ""have the numbers"" and beyond that, ""everyone in the entire country hates them and most of the adults are willing to take action against them, whether it's to take up weapons or to be human shields."" In addition, ""you have a president who is providing Churchillian leadership, the people [are] undaunted and Ukrainian forces continue to exploit their home-field advantage."" Ukraine has defied expectations and continued to hold its capital and most of its major cities a little under a week after the Kremlin launched an incursion into the country. Russian troops have been slow to move on Kyiv as they struggle with logistical problems such as lack of food and gas, reports of low morale, and intense resistance from Ukrainian forces, according to the Pentagon. But Petraeus warned that as Putin grows more frustrated with his forces halting progress, it will lead Russian troops ""to do more of what we have seen in the last 48 hours"" and step up the severity of their attacks using more devastating weapons targeting government facilities and infrastructure such as hospitals and schools. ""They'll starve the population of Kyiv if they have to but that population I don't think is going to crack,"" he said. Though Ukraine has held its ground, the conflict has still been devastating for the population, with more than 2,000 civilians killed since Thursday, with the invasion began, according to the country's emergency service. And nearly 900,000 Ukrainians have fled the country, according to figures from the United Nations.",World/The Hill,Gen.

3/5/2022,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - As Russian troops slowly advanced on Ukraine's capital Kyiv on Thursday, some people back in Moscow were attempting to flee to destinations abroad that have not banned flights from Russia, stomaching soaring prices in the rush to escape. The Kremlin dismissed speculation that Russian authorities plan to introduce martial law following the invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"", or that they will stop men of fighting age leaving Russia, but some did not want to risk staying. One Russian man, who moved back to Moscow from western Europe around a year ago, said he had bought a flight to Istanbul for the weekend, adding that living in Moscow may no longer be possible. ""I'm afraid that mobilisation will be introduced tomorrow and I won't be able to fly out,"" said the 29-year-old, requesting anonymity like others cited in this article. ""In my worst nightmares I couldn't have dreamt of such hell when I was coming back a year ago."" Another man, aged 38, said he had managed to buy an expensive ticket to fly to the Middle East at the weekend. ""I don't want to fight in this war. We've heard lots of rumours and I don't trust the Kremlin when it says they aren't true,"" he said. Russia's invasion of Ukraine entered its second week on Thursday with Ukrainian cities surrounded and under bombardment. Hundreds of Russian soldiers and Ukrainian civilians have been killed and Russia has been plunged into an isolation never before experienced by an economy of such size. FEARING ARREST The cost of plane tickets has leapt since Russia closed its airspace to airlines from the European Union and many other countries in a tit-for-tat response to sanctions imposed by the West, severely limiting Russians' ability to travel. The unprecedented Western sanctions on Moscow have already sent prices rising and started hitting the lives of ordinary Russians, while those who protest have been swiftly arrested. Some 7,669 people have been detained at anti-war protests since the invasion began on Feb. 24, according to the OVD-Info protest-monitoring group. After giving her cat to her family to look after, a 29-year-old woman flew to Israel on Sunday before prices rose even further, worried that things in Moscow can only get worse. ""I am ashamed that I haven't stayed in Russia, that I am not fighting to the end, not protesting in the streets,"" she said. ""But if you go out against the war, they arrest you, and there is this law on state treason."" Russia's state prosecutor's office on Feb. 27 issued a reminder that anyone providing financial or other assistance to a foreign state or international organisation aimed against Russia's security could be convicted of treason and face a maximum sentence of 20 years. VISA PROBLEMS Others faced bureaucratic hurdles. Russians require visas to enter most European countries, and a modest queue had formed at the Italian visa application centre in Moscow, which was still accepting requests by appointment only, with the nearest available slots over a week away. ""I will make an appointment for March 11, although what may happen in the near future is scary and uncertain,"" said one 40-year-old Russian woman. ""I want to have a visa ready. I think they will let me in with a PCR test (against COVID) and then I'll sort something out,"" she added. Russia's Sputnik V vaccine has not been approved by the EU, meaning many Russians without a shot recognised in the West may be denied entry on health grounds. It was not just Russians trying to flee. A Filipino woman who works as a nanny in Moscow was also applying for a visa. ""I desperately want to get a visa, I'm scared here,"" she said.

3/5/2022,"President Joe Biden had a crystal clear message for Russian oligarchs: We're coming for your assets. ""The United States Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of the Russian oligarchs. We're joining with European allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We're coming for your ill-begotten gains,"" Biden said Wednesday during the State of the Union. Just hours after that speech, French authorities announced they had seized a yacht linked to Russian oligarch Igor Sechin. But it isn't just Russian oligarchs who are on edge. Wealthy non-oligarch Russians are also fretting asset seizure. In the decades since the Soviet Union collapsed, rich Russians have poured gobs of money into American real estate. Now they're worried they could get caught in the crossfire as the U.S. goes after Vladimir Putin's allies. Dolly Lenz, one of the most sought-after luxury real estate brokers in America, tells Fortune she's getting inundated with inquiries from Russian clients who are considering selling their U.S. real estate holdings. Those luxury units—with a lot worth over $10 million—are in some of Miami’s and New York City’s most exclusive neighborhoods, including Billionaires’ Row in Manhattan. ""The heat is up. They're scared that they're going to have their real estate seized or potentially seized. Or linked to someone who is seized. They're scared to death of [guilt] by association,"" Lenz says. While she has yet to see a flood of Russian-owned luxury real estate hit the market, she says it's on the horizon. ""There are already more inquiries, and that's how it starts. That's how we know [a flood of listings by Russians] is coming."" Not only are more ultrawealthy Russians looking to sell their properties, Lenz says, many want to cancel upcoming real estate projects and business deals, even if it means losing their deposit. ""We know of several deals where [Russian] buyers had put down money on new development—with significant deposits. And are deciding to not go through with the deal. That's pretty bad…They told us they will walk away from the deposit if the climate stays this way,"" Lenz says. In some cases, she says, they'd lose a deposit upwards of $15 million if they go through with exiting the real estate development deals. Lenz also has Russian clients who are interested in off-loading property they own on Fisher Island. Located just off the shore of Miami, the island, which is dotted with luxury condominiums, has become an absolute hotbed for Russian billionaires and oligarchs. In 2017, a Russian buyer snagged the largest penthouse at Fisher Island’s Palazzo del Sol—a luxury condominium where Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov used to have a residence—for $31 million. Just last month, Russian hockey star Ilya Kovalchuk bought a $8.5 million condo at Fisher Island's Palazzo Della Luna. Those two buildings, along with the island's Palazzo Del Mare—where Russian businessman Igor Olegovich Nesterenko sold his five-bedroom unit last month for $21 million—in particular, are known for being sought-after by wealthy Russians. But not everyone Fortune spoke with is seeing an influx of Russian luxury sellers. Stuart Siegel, global head of private office at Engel & Völkers Americas, says it's too early to tell if the Ukraine invasion will correspond with a wave of Russians selling their U.S. real estate holdings. He says economic and political instability in Russia could even encourage some Russians—at least those who aren't on federal watch lists—to cling to their American real estate holdings. ""In times of global turmoil, American real estate has always been viewed as a safe harbor,"" Siegel says.

3/5/2022,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that Russian troops are lugging mobile cremation chambers with them as they continue their assault across the country, allegedly to dispose of their own dead and obscure the true number of casualties they’ve incurred. “These guys are carrying those cremation chambers for themselves,” Zelenskyy said at a press conference with reporters in Kyiv where he lamented that young Russian soldiers are being used as “cannon fodder.” “It’s inhumane,” he said. Zelenskyy said a large number of Russians are believed to have died in the conflict so far, but he alleged that no one is keeping track. Russian President Vladimir Putin amassed around 150,000 troops to support the conflict, according to the Pentagon. Most have been deployed. “No one is counting them. No one cares how many die in the shellings,” Zelenskyy said. “They knew in advance they were not going to show to their families, to their mothers, what happened to their children, that they died here,” he went on. “They came here to kill us, and we are defending our freedom and our homes, and that’s why they’re dying. We don’t want to kill them.” ""[Russia] brought crematoriums with them... we don't want to kill them""

Ukrainian President Zelensky tells a press conference ""the end of the world has arrived""https://t.co/W8jtiNhp4ppic.twitter.com/nGkMiIKTg4 — BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) March 3, 2022 In the eight days since the invasion began, people on social media have circulated graphic photos and videos of dead Russian soldiers apparently abandoned on the sides of roads. The Telegraph previously reported that mobile crematoriums were expected to be used on the battlefield, citing U.K. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace. Putin pledged Thursday to grant the families of fallen soldiers 5 million rubles ― around $50,000 ― in what The New York Times said was the first time Putin publicly acknowledged that Russians have died in the war. The Russian leader also sought to downplay widespread reports that the Ukrainians have put up a much stronger defense than he’d anticipated, claiming that the “special military operation in Ukraine” is “going strictly according to the schedule just as it has been planned.” The Russian Defense Ministry on Wednesday announced that nearly 500 of its soldiers have been killed and another 1,600 injured, although Western estimates are significantly higher. Ukraine says its fighters have killed more than 5,000 Russian troops. An American official told The New York Times the figure is more like 2,000. Russia reportedly took control of the Ukrainian port city Kherson this week ― the first major city to be taken over. But according to the Pentagon, and scattered reports, the Russian military is facing a serious morale problem made worse by food shortages. Some Russian troops are sabotaging their own military vehicles and laying down arms, according to the Pentagon, in order to avoid fighting a war that Russian authorities have baselessly described as a mission to liberate oppressed Ukrainians.

3/5/2022,"The subject is Putin’s brain. Is President Putin clinically insane? Is he choreographing madness and threats of a nuclear holocaust to frighten the West? Or does Putin know precisely what he’s doing? The questions are reasonable, but ultimately unanswerable. There is a data point, however: Russian and German scientists at Moscow’s aptly named Research Institute of the Brain in 1925 sliced and diced 30,953 sections of Vladimir Lenin’s cytoarchitecture for indications of genius. The results of that research remain a mystery, as does a solution to the enigma of whether the heir to Lenin’s throne—one Vladimir Putin—believes his own hype or is experiencing buyer’s remorse over an invasion that caught the rest of the Kremlin unawares. Sadly, work has not yet begun dissecting Putin’s cerebrum for clues. Short of delving inside his mind, Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Europe and Russia on the U.S. National Security Council during the Trump administration, did a splendid job of purifying Putin’s sense and sensibility in a recent interview. “Putin is increasingly operating emotionally,” she told Politico. “It’s reestablishing dominance over what Russia sees as the Russian Imperium. We’re treading back through old historical patterns that we said that we would never permit to happen again.” Rewind about 150 years and you will hear a familiar refrain from Russia’s imperial Romanov family, who spent 300 years brutally persuading their subjects to back endless wars. “If the West is cursing Russia, Russia is doing something right,” blustered the multi-titled Emperor of Russia, King of Congress Poland, and Grand Duke of Finland. To be sure, you really had to be in the audience to feel the full force of tub-thumping late-19th-century Tsar Alexander III’s patriotic call to arms but Alexander Romanov is widely believed to be Putin’s favorite tsar. He was assassinated in 1881. A group of young people hurled three bombs at him (without the assistance of TikTok). The Bolsheviks in 1918 murdered the last of the Romanov thoroughbreds in a cellar. The Soviets followed with 69 years of great expectations. The happy drunk and baptized Russian Orthodox Christian Boris Yeltsin became the star of the show in 1991, until Putin took over in 2000. Still, for the casual visitor, Russia’s memory lane never stretched much further than the gift shop at the Hermitage Museum. Once upon a time in Moscow, Red Square was an open air market built atop a pavement of logs laid down to cover the mud and keep the tsar’s boots clean and the patriarch’s robe sparkling when they strolled out of the Kremlin. That is the level of reverence Putin has spent the past 22 years resurrecting on state-controlled television for his isolated home audience of 146 million Russian souls. “Russian politicians excel in making people everywhere believe in things which are not real,” Vladimir Yerofeyev once explained over dinner during my years as a correspondent in Moscow. Yerofeyev should know. He was Joseph Stalin’s translator and no slouch when it came to triggering the trickery Russian leaders use to rally public support to exorcise Western criticism. The Imperial Kremlin has two masters, one temporal, the other spiritual. The tsar and the Russian Patriarch of All Moscow and All Rus. The tsar and his hierophant-in-chief worked and lived and ruled in tandem. “There’s no difference between the secular realm and the spiritual realm,” explains the Byzantine and Russian historian Henry Hopwood-Phillips. “The tsar and the patriarch are meant to occupy the same body and the same mystical mind. That’s the anvil of Russia’s domestic Byzantine statecraft.” And Putin’s hammer is wielded by God. “Let God save the Russian soil,” Putin’s Patriarch Kirill earlier this week on TV told his flock of 90 million devout parishioners. “When I say Russian, I use an ancient expression from the chronicles of where Russian soil started, which includes the Ukraine and Belarus. God forbid,” Kirill thundered, “that the evil forces that have always fought against the unity of Russia and the Russian church get the upper hand in brotherly Ukraine.” Kirill’s frequent pronouncements in support of Putin’s destruction of Ukraine are not gibberish and, for more Russians than many in the West might want to believe, it’s not lunacy. According to a Feb. 27 poll conducted by Obshestvennoemnenie, 71 percent of the 1,500 respondents said Putin is “working his post rather well” and that they “generally trust him.” Indeed, Russia’s incarcerated opposition leader Alexei Navalny, in a message recently smuggled out of his jail cell, raged against Putin’s primitive melding of the secular and the spiritual to retain miraculous power. “I will not remain silent watching pseudo-historical nonsense about the events of 100 years ago become an excuse for Russians to kill Ukrainians,” Navalny pleaded. “Let us not become a nation of frightened silent people. Of cowards who pretend not to notice the aggressive war against Ukraine unleashed by our obviously insane czar.” He is desperately trying to recapture a romanticized heyday. “Putin looks to be suffering deep melancholy,” reckons Hopwood-Phillips. “His consciousness is still floating in the 17th century, and 44 million Ukrainians are paying the price.” In Putin’s Russia, nostalgia is what it used to be.

3/5/2022,"ATLANTA — A critical witness in a Georgia criminal investigation into Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election said he is “emotionally torn” about the case, fearing that a potential prosecution could end up reinforcing the former president’s status as a “martyr.” Gabriel Sterling, the chief operations officer for the Georgia secretary of state who angrily denounced Trump’s false claims of election fraud in December 2020, confirmed in an interview with Yahoo News that he met some months ago with two prosecutors and two investigators for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who grilled him about the state’s election procedures. “They’re trying to figure out where Trump could think he has a leverage point, a point where he could manipulate the system potentially,” said Sterling. It was the latest confirmation that Willis’s probe has been quietly active and ongoing for some time even as it is poised to soon find itself in the national spotlight. Willis has gotten approval to convene a special grand jury in May when witnesses like Sterling; his boss, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger; and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, among others, are expected to receive subpoenas to testify. It is a probe that has taken on new significance nationally in light of the news that two top prosecutors in New York City who were working on a separate investigation into Trump’s finances have resigned, apparently after concluding that the newly elected district attorney in Manhattan, Alvin Bragg, was disinclined to bring charges against the former president. That, say multiple legal experts, leaves Willis’s probe into Trump’s effort to pressure Georgia state officials to flip the state’s electoral votes as the principal threat of criminal prosecution facing the ex-president. “It does make the Georgia case all the more important,” said Norm Eisen, a former White House lawyer under President Barack Obama who last year co-authored a report for the Brookings Institution concluding that Trump was at a “substantial risk” for multiple felony charges in Georgia, including criminal solicitation to commit election fraud and state racketeering charges. But it is a case that is fraught with political minefields for Willis and her office — and more legal complications than have been commonly understood. “She's kind of like Wile E. Coyote picking up the dynamite stick,” said Sterling. (Separately, the committee investigating the Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021, argued in a Wednesday court filing seeking access to the emails of one of Trump’s lawyers, John Eastman, that the former president and his allies engaged in a “criminal conspiracy” in his efforts to overturn the election. But the committee has no authority to initiate criminal proceedings and there is still no clear indication that the Justice Department has targeted the former president.) The Georgia investigation centers on the hourlong phone call that Trump, Meadows and three of Trump's lawyers placed to Raffensperger on Jan. 2, 2021, in which the president repeatedly pressed the Georgia official to “find” 11,780 votes — “which is one more” than needed — to reverse Joe Biden’s victory in the state. Trump also appeared to threaten Raffensperger, telling him he was taking a “big risk” and could face criminal charges himself if he did not do what the president was demanding. But the phone call, which was secretly taped by Raffensperger’s office and leaked to the Washington Post, has been fully public for over a year, leaving some to wonder why it has taken Willis so long to get to this point. “I know justice moves slowly sometimes, but she's been in office for 14 months,” said Raffensperger. “If it was a high priority, you know, where was she last year?” Raffensperger remains a reluctant witness in an unenviable political vice. He is running for reelection against a Trump-backed primary opponent, Rep. Jody Hice, who has hammered him for failing to do the former president’s bidding. With the polls showing over 70 percent of GOP voters still believing in Trump’s bogus claims of election fraud, Raffensperger has tiptoed around the Willis probe. His office has turned over some 6,000 pages of internal documents relating to its handling of the 2020 election and contacts with the White House, including text messages from Meadows and multiple emails from Trump’s lawyers and political allies. (Records obtained by Yahoo News show that Willis’s office didn’t use a subpoena to get the material. Instead, on April 20, 2021, nearly 11 months ago, it filed an Open Records request for the material — something any citizen could have done — asking for all tape recordings, voicemail messages and emails to Georgia officials from Trump “and/or anyone acting on his behalf.”) But Raffensperger himself has refused to testify without a subpoena — a key reason Willis sought the special grand jury. Once he gets one, Raffensperger, like Sterling, intends to comply. “You don't get a choice when you get a subpoena from the grand jury,” he said. Raffensperger’s comments about the slow pace of the probe point to some of the political dilemmas Willis herself is facing as she navigates a potential prosecution of the former president. A 50-year-old graduate of Howard University and Emory Law School, Willis built up a reputation as an aggressive, hard-charging prosecutor — likened by one friend to a “tornado” in the courtroom — who, along with veteran attorney Clint Rucker, successfully tried in 2015 one of the most high-profile and controversial cases in recent Atlanta history: racketeering charges against Atlanta public school administrators and teachers for systematically changing test results of students to give them higher scores. (Thirty-four of the originally named 35 defendants were African American, making the case a touchy subject in the city’s Black community.) But no sooner did she take office last year — after defeating her longtime boss, veteran incumbent Paul Howard — than Willis began sounding the alarm about what she described as deep-seated problems in her office. She had, she said, inherited a “mismanaged” and understaffed unit, besieged by a backlog of 12,000 unprosecuted felonies as well as surging crime rates. “We have a public safety crisis going on,” Willis said in impassioned testimony before the Fulton County Board of Commissioners last July, pounding the table at times as she pleaded for more funding to hire prosecutors and investigators. She then proceeded to display blow-up color photographs of victims of murders, shootings, sexual assaults and other violent crimes, pointedly identifying the commissioners’ districts in which the victims resided. “If there is anybody here confused, and thinks I’m here to talk about widgets, I’m talking about human life,” she said. “Not one of your constituents is safe.” Willis’s powerful plea won her $5 million in new funding last September to beef up staffing in her office. But her warnings about soaring homicides and violent assaults in the county left some constituents wondering about her priorities in pursuing the Trump investigation. “We have crime issues that are unprecedented — and your focus is Trump?” said one county official who has known and worked with Willis for years. But one Willis ally contended that a Trump prosecution would not be a distraction from other important cases. “There’s not one person in that office who’s been pulled off a murder or rape case” to investigate Trump, said Charlie Bailey, a former colleague of Willis’s in the DA’s office who is currently running for lieutenant governor of Georgia. “Fani can walk and chew gum at the same time.” Eisen, in his Brookings report, cited the Raffensperger phone call as only one piece of a wide-ranging conspiracy by Trump and his allies to improperly pressure state officials to change election results. Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s lawyer, appeared before a Georgia state legislative committee and made blatantly false claims about a video — calling it a “smoking gun” — that supposedly showed Fulton County election workers taking out boxes of fraudulent Biden ballots to be secretly counted on election night. (State officials found nothing improper in the handling of the ballots.) The U.S. attorney in Georgia, B.J. Pak, was effectively forced to resign — after being told Trump was planning to fire him for not endorsing the claims of election fraud. And Trump himself called Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to urge him to call a “special election” to replace the certified vote count. Then he called the chief investigator in Raffensperger’s office, Frances Watson, to push her to find “dishonesty” in the vote totals. A spokesman for Willis did not respond to requests for comment from Yahoo News on the status of the case. She has reportedly assembled a team of 10 prosecutors to conduct the investigation, including John Floyd, one of the leading authorities on the state racketeering law. She also has asked for the FBI’s help in providing security for her investigation in the face of multiple threats from Trump supporters. Still, legal experts say, she faces substantial legal hurdles. Trump’s lawyers will almost certainly seek to move the case to federal court and attempt to have any indictment dismissed on the grounds that, since the conduct at issue took place while he was president, he is immune from prosecution. And even if those motions fail, getting a jury in Fulton County (where Trump got about a quarter of the vote in 2020 and the jury pool is 46 percent white) to unanimously conclude that he was pressuring Raffensperger to commit fraud — as opposed to urging him to find fraud that Trump genuinely believed existed — could prove challenging. “I’m skeptical,” said Don Samuel, one of Atlanta’s most renowned defense attorneys and a self-described liberal Democrat. “It’s a little hard for me to see a jury ever convicting Trump. You’re not going to get 12 Democrats on the jury.” Sterling is an example of the ambivalence many in Atlanta feel about the Trump probe. A loyal Republican who had long been active in state politics, Sterling burst onto the national stage after he got a disturbing phone call in the weeks after the election from a project manager for Dominion Voting Systems, the firm that had provided election machines in the state. The project manager told him about a threat on Twitter to one of her employees who had been falsely accused — by QAnon conspiracy followers — of manipulating vote totals. When he looked at the tweet, Sterling was furious. “It said, ‘May God have mercy on your soul.’ And it had a noose kind of twisting in the sunlight,” said Sterling. “And for whatever reason, that day, that time, it hit me. I'm like ... ‘I'm done, I'm done, I'm done. I'm pissed. I've got to, we got to say something.’” Sterling called a press conference. “I can't begin to explain the level of anger I have right now over this,” he said at the time. “Mr. President, it looks like you likely lost the state of Georgia. We're investigating. There's always a possibility, I get it, and you have the rights to go through the courts. What you don't have the ability to do — and you need to step up and say this — is stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence.” Sterling then raised his voice as he delivered a stark warning: “Someone's going to get hurt. Someone's going to get shot. Someone's going to get killed.” Those turned out to be prophetic words, coming a little more than a month before the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. Today, more than a year later, Sterling suggests he still wants accountability for Trump, emphasizing at one point that “there have been no consequences for him.” “We have laws in this country,” he said. Trump’s actions are “all the same thing to me, all the way to Jan. 6. Question, question, question. Undermine, undermine, undermine. “And he made a game out of it, almost. Because the more he was persecuted — I'm putting big air quotes up there — the more he was able to give himself a freer rein to do whatever he felt like.” And yet, when it comes to Willis’s probe, Sterling worries that a criminal prosecution will only make Trump even more of a “martyr” to his supporters, “which means he can raise even more money.” “I don't know what the right path is on this thing,” he said.",Politics/Yahoo News,Key witness in Georgia's Trump investigation: I'm 'emotionally torn' about the case,https://news.yahoo.com/key-witness-in-georgias-trump-investigation-im-emotionally-torn-about-the-case-133848613.html
3/5/2022,"It was a family affair in late February aboard Sunshine and Whiskey, Micah Young’s custom-built 27-foot boat, which was launched from the Carroll Campbell Marine Complex in Georgetown. The plan was to catch Young’s father, John Young, a mess of black sea bass and run the boat in advance of competing in the ongoing South Carolina Wahoo Series. In late 2021, Micah Young, a Marine Biology teacher at Wilson High School in Florence, headed north from the Winyah Bay jetties to a bottom spot and found a very nice grade of black sea bass, much larger than the 13-inch minimum size limit, in about 40 feet of water. The Youngs, with Micah’s 15-year-old son Thomas and brother Kevin also aboard, returned to the same spot and quickly found black sea bass were still there, readily hitting mullet and squid, but the fish were a smaller grade. As usual, Micah Young worked a Bluewater Candy Roscoe jig on the spot soon after they got set up. “A lot of people use those for black sea bass, especially targeting the big ones. I don’t pull up on any (spot) that I don’t put a jig down — anything will hit them. I always put one down first and give that a whirl while everybody else is fishing with bait.” After about 15 minutes, Micah Young hooked up with a fish bigger than he expected on the jig in about 40 feet of water. “To be honest, I’ve heard rumors over the years, especially around Beaufort, of people catching goliath grouper,” said Micah Young, who was using a medium-class setup with a Quantum reel and 20-pound test. “The way the fish was pulling, I couldn’t think of anything else pulling that big in that shallow water. It kept digging in the structure like a 30-40 pound grouper. “I couldn’t do much, I couldn’t put too much pressure on (the fish). Once we got him off the wreck, he headed north and just went. We had to follow him like you would a really big king.” After about 30 minutes they finally got a good look at the fish and knew it wasn’t a goliath grouper. “When we saw it we thought it was a 100-pound redfish,” said Micah Young. “It was gold, a beautiful fish. Then it rolled over and we immediately saw it was a black drum.” They worked to get the fish in the boat for a quick photo op before the all-important release. Young estimated the old female spawner weighed 80-90 pounds and was 12 inches thick. “Going black sea bass fishing and pulling this up, this was just crazy,” said Young. “I’m 6-2, 230 pounds and it was all I could do to hoist that thing up to get a picture.” Then it was on to the release, as black drum are governed by a 14-27 inch slot limit in South Carolina waters. “I’ve taught Marine Biology for 22 years, and to make sure that fish survives is important,” said Young. “That fish is probably 50-60 years old. The pic was taken quick — I was adamant we were not going to let her die. We pulled her along with the boat and she kicked and took off. Then we stayed right there where I dropped her.” Young, 49, has been fishing from Georgetown to Murrells Inlet since he was a youngster, and was exhilarated with the catch and release. “It took me 40 years to catch a fish like that,” said Young. On a standard near-shore bottom-fishing trip the Youngs ended up with a catch of a lifetime, and their mess of black sea bass to boot. The Student Angler League Tournament Trail opened the spring semester of the 2021-22 season last Saturday in Georgetown. The trail features three tournaments each semester of the school year with all six events based out of the Carroll Campbell Marine Complex on the Sampit River. The student anglers, from elementary to high school, can target bass or red drum in SALTT events. A cold front with heavy winds was in the offing, but the student anglers weathered the poor conditions and still weighed in numerous quality fish. The division winners follow: Elementary School Redfish: Madelyn Taylor of Kensington Elementary won with a big fish of 1.40 pounds. No other anglers weighed fish in the division. Middle School Redfish: Aden Day and Ayden Rouhselang of Conway won with a two-fish aggregate of 5.08 pounds including the Big Fish at 2.91 pounds. No other anglers weighed fish in the division. High School Redfish: Cubby Weaver of Georgetown won with a two-fish aggregate of 7.93 pounds including the Big Fish of 4.16 pounds. Mackenzie Hardwick of Hartsville finished second with a two-fish aggregate of 7.54 pounds. Oliver Bomar and Connor Strickland were third with two fish weighing 7.09 pounds. Elementary School Bass: Hartley Davis of Andrews won with a big fish of 1.43 pounds. No other anglers weighed fish in the division. Middle School Bass: Branson and Tucker Howell of Conway won with a five-fish aggregate of 12.85 pounds including the big fish of 5.13 pounds. Wilson Hewitt of Georgetown and Tucker Howard of Andrews finished second with a five-fish aggregate of 8.63 pounds. Gunner Hucks of Whittemore Park and Levi Dickerson of Aynor were third with a five-fish aggregate of 6.92 pounds. High School Bass: Dalton Hewitt and Brantley Todd won with a heavy five-fish aggregate of 18.65 pounds. Gavin Porter of North Myrtle Beach finished second with a five-fish aggregate of 14.43 pounds including the big fish of 4.24 pounds. Riley Harrington of Andrews finished third with a five-fish aggregate of 11.67 pounds. The next events in the series are set for March 12, March 26 and May 7.

3/5/2022,"“Give us the tools, and we will finish the job,“ spoke U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill in February 1941. Following this powerful speech, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt proposed and Congress approved the lend-lease program. This provided the U.K. equipment and access to United States production capacity. This action was essential to stopping the Nazi advances. History often rhymes. Now, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is making the same plea for equipment necessary to stop the advance of the Russian autocratic Army. Now is the time for another lend-lease program supporting Ukraine. Congress is acting in a supportive manner, but details are important. Russia must face a military defeat to enforce sanctions. The history of sanctions supports the conclusion that they do not change policy, but rather make conduct of business far more difficult while imposing distress on the economy as shown in Iraq, Iran, North Korea and others. Sanctions must be accompanied by military success. Zelenskyy has requested weapons and support in line with Churchill’s philosophy. Ukrainian soldiers have proved their courage and bravery. There is one more step that could be decisive: the transfer of three squadrons of A-10 aircraft to the Ukrainian Air Force. This aircraft and its gun system were designed to counter an armored assault in Europe. They proved effective in Desert Storm’s target-rich environment, quite similar to the current advancing Russian force. They also became the infantry’s friend in close-air support missions. The United States Air Force has deployment packages ready to go. The whole transfer to the Ukrainian Air Force could be completed in days after congressional authorization. Firepower is needed to defeat the coming onslaught of armored forces. Other weapons are necessary for ground forces, but air power will be decisive. The A-10 has proven this ability and was designed for this purpose. Zelenskyy asked NATO for air support. This request was declined by NATO. That is an appropriate decision since Russia has not attacked NATO. However, that decision leaves each country an opportunity to decide based on its own moral compass. Many, including the United States, have decided to provide and have already supplied lethal aid necessary to slow the Russian advance. Some effects are notable, but military analysts agree that the long-term outlook for Ukraine’s survival is not good. One predicts a continuing resistance war for decades. Zelenskyy is right in requesting air power support. It is necessary to slow or stop the oncoming juggernaut of Russian armored forces. The United States has the most effective weapon for this role — the U.S. Air Force’s A-10 aircraft. It is available since the service wants to retire most of the 30-year-old fleet. The airplane was designed to operate in Europe from ill-prepared facilities. Pilot retraining is minimal. All that is needed is painting Ukrainian insignia and delivering the aircraft. This could be done in days. Each day is critical to slowing the momentum of Russia’s invading force. It is time to implement the United States’ moral compass and add the A-10 to the list of weapons already scheduled. Failure to add defensive capability to current Ukraine forces, while sanctions develop, weakens the potential impact of sanctions. They are complementary actions.

3/5/2022,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A Northern California woman whose disappearance and mysterious reappearance set off a frantic three-week search more than five years ago was arrested Thursday on charges of lying to federal agents about being kidnapped and defrauding the state's victim compensation board of $30,000. Sherri Papini, 39, of Redding, was found on Thanksgiving Day in 2016 after weeks of searching in California and several nearby states, with bindings on her body and injuries including a swollen nose and a “brand” on her right shoulder. She had been reported missing Nov. 2. She told authorities at the time that she had been kidnapped at gunpoint by two Hispanic women, even providing descriptions to an FBI sketch artist along with extensive details of her purported abduction. In reality, authorities said, she was staying with a former boyfriend nearly 600 miles (966 kilometers) away from her home in Orange County, in Southern California, and hurt herself to back up her false statements. “When a young mother went missing in broad daylight, a community was filled with fear and concern,” U.S. Attorney Phillip Talbert said in a statement. ""Ultimately, the investigation revealed that there was no kidnapping and that time and resources that could have been used to investigate actual crime, protect the community, and provide resources to victims were wasted.” Papini does not yet have an attorney because she was just arrested, Talbert's office said. Her first court appearance has not yet been set. She was still lying about the kidnapping in August 2020 when she was interviewed by a federal agent and a Shasta County sheriff’s detective, the charges allege. They showed her evidence indicating she had not been abducted and warned her that it was a crime to lie to a federal agent. But she still made false statements, the charges allege. She also was reimbursed more than $30,000 by the California Victim’s Compensation Board based on the false story, the charges said. They included money for visits to her therapist for “treatment for anxiety and PTSD,"" according to a court filing, and for the ambulance ride to the hospital after she surfaced near Sacramento. She faces a mail fraud charge related to the reimbursement requests that carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison, while lying to a federal officer has a maximum five-year sentence. “Everyone involved in this investigation had one common goal: to find the truth about what happened on Nov. 2, 2016, with Sherri Papini and who was responsible,"" said Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson. That 22-day search and five-year investigation not only cost money and time, he said, “but caused the general public to be fearful of their own safety, a fear that they should not have had to endure.” Before she disappeared, Papini had gone jogging near her home about 215 miles (350 kilometers) north of San Francisco. Her husband, Keith Papini, found only her cellphone and earphones when he went searching after she failed to pick up their children at day care. She left her purse and jewelry behind. Investigators said he passed a lie detector test. They also cleared a Detroit man they said Papini had texted and planned to meet shortly before her disappearance. He was in California at the time of her disappearance but told investigators they never met, though they had spent a weekend together in 2011. Papini's nose was swollen and she was wearing a chain restraint around her waist and one arm along with other bindings around her other wrist and each ankle when she was found alongside Interstate 5 nearly 150 miles from her home, according to a court filing Thursday. She had other bruises and rashes on many parts of her body, ligature marks on her wrists and ankles, and burns on her left forearm. Her blonde hair had been cut to shoulder length and she had a blurred “brand” burned into her right shoulder, authorities said at the time. She had both male and female DNA on her body and clothing. The DNA eventually led to the former boyfriend in 2020, according to a court filing. The former boyfriend told investigators that Papini stayed with him at his house during the time she was gone, and said she had asked him to come to Redding to pick her up, though he said they never had sex. His account was verified when authorities tracked the locations of two prepaid cellphones that they had been using to secretly talk to one another as early as December 2015, according to a 55-page affidavit filed in court to support the criminal charges. A cousin of the former boyfriend told investigators that he saw Papini in the man's apartment twice, both times unrestrained. About three weeks later, records backed the ex-boyfriend's story that he rented a car and drove Papini back to Northern California. A GoFundMe campaign raised more than $49,000 to help the family, which the couple used to pay off bills and for other expenses, according to the court filing. At the time, she was a stay-at-home mom and her husband worked at Best Buy. There was never a ransom demand, and the family wasn't wealthy, officials said at the time. In retrospect, “we are relieved that the community is not endangered by unknown, violent kidnappers,” said Sean Ragan, special agent in charge of the FBI's Sacramento Field Office.",U.S./Associated Press,"Prosecutors: Woman faked kidnapping, defrauded California",https://news.yahoo.com/california-woman-faked-kidnapping-defrauded-010104019.html
