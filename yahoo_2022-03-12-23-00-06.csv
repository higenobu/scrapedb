3/12/2022,"A Bradenton man and his girlfriend were driving home from lunch at Olive Garden on April 13, 2017, when she teased him by flicking candy wrappers at him when he pulled up to a red light. He took out his gun from the center counsel and held it to the left side of her stomach. Then he pulled the trigger. Amaris Peralta, 28, ended up dying from her injuries nearly two years later, on Valentine’s Day 2019. On Wednesday morning, Circuit Judge Frederick Mercurio sentenced Jimmy Hernandez-Pantoja, 24, to 20 years in prison. After his release, Hernandez-Pantoja will be on probation for five years. “While there is no making sense of this tragic and unprovoked act of violence, we sincerely hope the resolution of this case brings some closure to the victim’s family,” said the lead prosecutor in the case, Assistant State Attorney Lauren P. Benson. Hernandez-Pantoja, 19 at the time of the shooting, claimed he didn’t know the gun was loaded. He rushed his girlfriend to Manatee Memorial Hospital and she was later taken to Blake Medical Center for treatment of her life-threatening injuries. They both told Manatee sheriff’s homicide detectives later that day and in the days that followed that the shooting was an accident and that he “was messing around with the gun.” But in February 2018, Peralta spoke with sheriff’s detectives again, telling them that Hernandez-Pantoja should have known the gun was loaded and that it wasn’t the first time he had pointed it at her. At the time, she and Hernandez-Pantoja were no longer in a relationship. Hernandez-Pantoja repeatedly told detectives that he didn’t know the gun was loaded and didn’t mean to shoot Peralta. Two months later, he was arrested and charged with attempted murder. On Aug. 15, 2018, he pleaded no contest to the charge and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. But when Peralta died in 2019, the 12th Circuit Medical Examiner’s Office ruled the manner of her death as homicide. Hernandez-Pantoja was later charged with second-degree murder with a firearm. Hernandez-Pantoja was brought back from prison to Manatee County to face the charges. Earlier this month, he was allowed to plead guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter with a firearm. “Jimmy Hernandez has and is taking responsibility for his actions in causing his girlfriend’s death, notwithstanding the equivocal fact that he did not intend or mean to kill her,” his defense attorney Liane McCurry said in a defense statement filed with the court ahead of his sentencing hearing. “He will live with the knowledge that, if he had not played around with his gun at the red light on U.S. 41, Amaris would not have suffered as she did, and she would be alive today.” Hernandez-Pantoja was given credit for the time he has served in jail or prison dating back to his April 30, 2018, arrest on the attempted murder charge.",U.S./Bradenton Herald,Bradenton man gets 20 years for shooting girlfriend flicking candy wrappers at him,https://news.yahoo.com/bradenton-man-gets-20-years-195553172.html
3/12/2022,"STORY: The rocket attacks also hit an ammunition depot, Vasylkiv Mayor Natalia Balasynovych said. Fighting raged northwest of Kyiv on Saturday, with the bulk of Russian ground forces 25 km (16 miles) from the centre of the Ukrainian capital, while several other cities were encircled and under heavy shelling, the UK defense ministry said. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said she hoped that several humanitarian corridors would open on Saturday for thousands of residents in the bombarded cities, including from the besieged port city of Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia. Air-raid sirens blared across most Ukrainian cities on Saturday morning urging people to seek shelters, local media reported, after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the war had reached a ""strategic turning point"". Russian forces appeared to be regrouping, possibly for a fresh offensive which could target the capital Kyiv in a few days, Britain's defense ministry said on Friday (March 11). In a Saturday update, it said fighting northwest of the capital continued and the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remained encircled under heavy Russian shelling.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Russian rockets destroy Ukrainian airbase: Interfax,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-rockets-destroy-ukrainian-airbase-112731419.html
3/12/2022,"ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — Croatian officials criticized NATO on Saturday for what they said was its slow reaction to a military drone that apparently flew all the way from the Ukrainian war zone over several NATO member states, before crashing in an urban zone of the Croatian capital. The Russian-made unmanned aircraft crossed Romania and Hungary before entering Croatia and slamming late Thursday into a field near a student dormitory. Some 40 parked cars were damaged but no one was injured after a loud blast. NATO said the alliance’s integrated air and missile defense had tracked the object’s flight path. But the Croatian prime minister said the country’s authorities were not informed and that NATO reacted only after question were posed by journalists. “We cannot tolerate this situation, nor should it have ever happened,” Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said while visiting the crash site. “This was a pure and clear threat and both NATO and the EU should have reacted,"" he said. ""We will work to raise the readiness not only of us but of others as well. ” Plenkovic said a Soviet-era Tu-141 “Strizh” reconnaissance drone flew for over 40 minutes over Hungary and six to seven minutes over Croatia before crashing. Earlier, the Romanian defense authorities said the flying object was in Romania’s airspace for only three minutes after crossing from Ukraine, making it hard to intercept. Plenkovic called on the Hungarian authorities to launch an investigation into why its defenses apparently did not notice the unmanned drone as both Croatia and Romania had little time to react to the fast-moving object. “Fortunately, something much worse did not happen,” Plenkovic said, adding that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban “found out about this after me.” “This could have fallen on the nuclear power plant in Hungary. Obviously there was no good reaction and other countries did not react well. Now we have a test from which we have to learn and react much better,” he said. He said that only an air crash investigation can determine who launched the drone — the Russians or the Ukrainians — after the object is pulled out of a large crater created after impact. Both Russia and Ukraine have denied they launched the drone. Military experts say Ukraine is the only known current operator of the Tu-141, which has a wingspan of nearly 4 meters (12 feet) and weighs just over 6 tons.",World/Associated Press,Croatia criticizes NATO after crash of Russian-made drone,https://news.yahoo.com/croatia-criticizes-nato-crash-russian-111501724.html
