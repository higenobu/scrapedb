4/24/2022,"Chelsea’s recent strife at Stamford Bridge is nothing new. They have struggled at home throughout Thomas Tuchel’s time in charge and the only thing that has changed since the manager’s opening game, a sterile goalless draw with Wolves 15 months ago, is that his side have become bad at defending as well as attacking. This is an issue that runs deeper than the defensive implosions against Brentford, Real Madrid and Arsenal. There is more to it than the concession of 11 goals in three home games. This is not a sudden decline: it is a problem that has been festering for a while and for Tuchel it raises awkward questions over how he sets his team up given that Chelsea have earned only three more points than Everton at home this season. There is no way to make the numbers look good. One statistic shows that Chelsea, with seven wins, five draws and three defeats, are ninth in the Premier League’s home table. Another reveals that Tuchel has the worst home record in the league of any Chelsea manager in the Roman Abramovich era. He has won 12, drawn eight and lost five games since replacing Frank Lampard, giving him a points-per-game tally of 1.76. It is a far cry from the days when Stamford Bridge was a fortress. Chelsea made life hell for visiting teams after appointing José Mourinho in 2004 and went 86 games without defeat at home in the league before Liverpool ended their run in October 2008. The fear factor is nowhere to be seen now. There have been flashes this season, most notably when they smashed Juventus 4-0 in the Champions League in November, but the performances have largely been flat in the final third. There has to be an improvement when Chelsea host West Ham on Sunday afternoon, particularly as Craig Dawson is the last centre-back standing in David Moyes’s squad. The challenge is to show intent from the start. There have been too many times when Chelsea have allowed games to drift; too many times when the atmosphere has dropped and the forwards have toiled against a deep defence. The contrast with Liverpool and Manchester City is stark. Inevitably, they have the strongest home records. If they face a weak opponent they pounce and, as Liverpool did when they beat Manchester United 4-0 at Anfield on Tuesday, they get the job done quickly. “I saw the match from Liverpool against United,” Tuchel says. “They looked incredibly fresh and strong. Manchester City won their home game again. That is why there is the difference. They are relentless and don’t allow much. We are more fragile at the moment.” Is it down to Tuchel’s system? He has favoured a 3-4-2-1 formation and prioritised control. It can feel overly cautious, more suited to playing away and hitting teams on the break. While Chelsea have the league’s second-best away record, at home there is little fury to their attacking. The pressing feels fragmented, they do not bully defences and when games are hanging in the balance there is always the risk of a late equaliser, as in the 1-1 draws with Burnley and Everton before Christmas. There is too much jeopardy. Chelsea needed a stoppage-time penalty to beat Leeds in December and a moment of late magic from Kai Havertz to see off Newcastle last month. Faced with a low block, they tend to run out of ideas. Even United were able to sit deep and hold Chelsea to a 1-1 draw. This is not what Tuchel, who has been griping about the Stamford Bridge pitch, envisaged at the start of the season. Chelsea were European champions and it seemed the addition of a goalscorer would make them more imposing at home. Clearly, though, buying Romelu Lukaku has only created more confusion. The £97.5m striker was awful during Wednesday’s 4-2 defeat to Arsenal and looks unsuited to Chelsea’s style. They play patiently. It is hard to see how a target man fits into this side. Equally, Lukaku is not alone in falling below expectations. Only Mason Mount has hit double figures in the league. Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic have four goals apiece. Callum Hudson‑Odoi has one. “If you look at the individual performances and the goalscorers and the assists at the top you find a lot of the Liverpool players,” Tuchel says. “We struggle to have these kind of numbers. We wish for quick games, quick decisions and quick goals but it’s tough.” It has left Chelsea unable to keep pace with City and Liverpool. Instead, there is mild concern about them being dragged into a fight for fourth with Arsenal, Tottenham and United. “It would not suit us if we told everyone before the season that we would open a box of champagne if we were fourth,” Tuchel says. “But we don’t feel ashamed because in general it is very tough to end up in the top four.” Tuchel tries to be optimistic. He points out that Chelsea have just won 6-0 at Southampton and were unlucky to exit the Champions League after beating Madrid 3-2 at the Bernabéu. The regret, though, is that Chelsea are rarely that lethal at Stamford Bridge. Carelessness at both ends of the pitch is holding them back and until he fixes his team’s home form Tuchel knows he can forget about catching City and Liverpool.",Sport/Football,Sterile home form undoes Thomas Tuchel’s ‘fragile’ Chelsea side,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/23/sterile-home-form-undoes-thomas-tuchels-fragile-chelsea-side
4/24/2022,"Jürgen Klopp says Liverpool signed the best midfielders in the Bundesliga when they acquired Naby Keïta in 2018 and Thiago Alcântara two years later. The duo cost a combined £81m but it has taken them time to make a consistent impact, something Everton may find out to their coston Sunday. While eight-figure transfer fees may raise expectations, Keïta and Thiago have taken their time to peak in a Liverpool shirt, honing their qualities in the centre of midfield. Each has endured spells on the sidelines at crucial points that have curtailed their momentum. Keïta has endured hamstring, ankle and knee problems but has been unavailable for one game since early December. Thiago contracted Covid on arrival in England and that was followed by a knee injury in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park last season in his second appearance for the club. At the start of April, Keïta declared after almost four years at Anfield: “I don’t believe we’ve seen the real Naby Keïta just yet.” His lowest moment was being replaced after 42 minutes of Liverpool’s 3-1 Champions quarter-final defeat at Real Madrid last season, his final appearance of the campaign. Some feared his Liverpool career was over at that point. The Guinean, however, has since found the rhythm Klopp was convinced he could. Regular appearances have allowed the 27-year-old to be more effective when pressing in the areas he aims to dominate. As a player who likes to dictate the tempo of a game, getting up to speed with the Premier League was important for Thiago, whose role can be to slow a match down when necessary. In the early stages of his Anfield career that seemed to show an inability to cope with the pace of English football. Instead, it was just his way of showing how in control of a match he can be at the right times. Thiago is one of the most technically gifted operators in the league. Despite not being particularly physical or quick, his speed of mind keeps him ahead of the opposition. The 31-year-old has settled off the pitch, aiding his development on it. The Italy-born Spain midfielder with Brazilian parents is considering putting down permanent roots in the north-west with his wife and two children when he retires. A sign Thiago is now in sync with the pace of the Premier League is that he is committing fewer fouls this season compared with his first in England. If a player is fouling opponents, it implies they are not in the right position defensively but the tenacious Thiago has corrected this, going from 2.5 fouls per 90 minutes in 2020-21 to 1.6 this campaign. Thiago understands his teammates and their positions, and vice versa. He is looking to break the lines and keep Liverpool advancing up the pitch, whether it is with a short, sharp pass or a crossfield delivery into space. Thiago and Keïta have been paired together for some of Liverpool’s most destructive performances this season, including their Champions League victory at Benfica and the FA Cup semi-final defeat of Manchester City, alongside Fabinho. This could be the preferred combination for the biggest matches in the run-in. Patience in football is a quality rarely seen but Klopp is a manager who has faith in those he has signed. He knows if his players have the right environment and conditions, they will improve under his guidance. From having two of the Bundesliga’s best midfielders, Klopp has two of the finest in the Premier League. As Klopp said: “That’s cool.”",Sport/Football,Naby Keïta and Thiago Alcântara flourish after finding their rhythm,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/23/naby-keita-and-thiago-alcantara-flourish-after-finding-their-rhythm
4/24/2022,"Ukraine will ask the US for more heavy weapons to defeat Russia, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday, before what he said was a “very significant” visit to Kyiv by the US secretary of state and defence secretary on Sunday. The Ukrainian president said the US and UK had provided his embattled country with the “best military support” since Vladimir Putin’s invasion two months ago. He said he would present an “armaments list” to the Biden administration on Sunday, in order to thwart Russia’s ongoing attempt to seize the Donbas region. With sufficient arms Ukraine’s military could take back “tomorrow” territory temporarily occupied by Russian forces in the south and east, Zelenskiy said. He acknowledged his “western partners” had recently speeded up delivery of arms, especially Washington. He praised European leaders who had been brave enough to come to Ukraine in person and said he hoped the US president, Joe Biden, would visit once the security situation allowed. He said his country didn’t need “tragic selfies”. Instead it required planes and tanks, he suggested. Zelenskiy’s pleas for further western assistance came at an extraordinary press conference in Kyiv. It took place in a venue deep underground, apparently chosen to protect the president from Russian bomb attack. More than 200 journalists were summoned to the Khreshchatyk metro station. After security checks, they descended several hundred metres on an elevator and then walked through a decorative Soviet-built chamber to the independence square metro stop. A silver dais had been set up in front of a Ukrainian flag and trident. Trains trundled surreally past. The president arrived at 7.30pm local time, flanked by Ukrainian commandos. It was Zelenskiy’s biggest media event since Moscow promised in February to “demilitarise” and “de-Nazify” Ukraine. The Kremlin plan to seize Kyiv within days failed and has now morphed into an open-ended war of conquest. In a meeting with his defence secretary, Sergei Shoigu, last week Putin was seen strangely clutching the table. Asked by the Observer if possible illness explained the Russian leader’s decision to invade Ukraine, Zelenskiy said: “It’s difficult to assess”. He stressed: “The Russian Federation always wanted something like this to happen. A lot of Russians don’t believe we are independent. We are attempting to repel an encroaching invasion. We are struggling for the right to live. It’s a war for Ukraine’s freedom.” Zelenskiy compared the Russia military’s behaviour in Ukraine to that of German fascist troops who subjugated Europe 80 years ago. “These are Russian Nazis. They will for ever be inscribed in the history books as barbarians,” he said, citing the murder of civilians including woman and children and widespread rape. Looking a little tired, and dressed in a grey military fleece, Zelenskiy spoke passionately about the destruction of peaceful communities. He said five Russian missiles slammed into the port city of Odesa on Saturday, killing eight people in an apartment building, and wounding eight. One of the dead was a three-month-old baby. “Try to grasp it. The war started when the child was a month old. These are pure bastards. They are monsters. It’s horrifying. They don’t care,” he said. A future war crimes tribunal would mete out justice against Russia’s leaders, he added. Zelenskiy reiterated his willingness to meet Putin for face to face negotiations. “I’m not afraid,” he declared, after reports of several Russian plots to kill him. But he said Ukraine would break off talks if Moscow went ahead next week with what he called a “pseudo-referendum” in the southern Kherson province. Russia appears poised to legitimise its land-grab by holding a sham vote in occupied areas, similar to the “referendums” in 2014 which saw the creation of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk’s people republics. A new vote would mean talks with Russia were “just theatre with very bad actors”, he said. Zelenskiy described the situation in besieged Mariupol as “monstrous”. He admitted Ukraine was facing hundreds of Russian armoured vehicles and would not be able to “de-blockade” the port city or its steel factory, where civilians have taken refuge. Russia continued to bombard the Azovstal plant, just hours after Putin pledged all attacks would cease, Zelenskiy said. Kyiv had offered to trade the civilians trapped inside for Russian serviceman but Moscow had refused offers of “pragmatic dialogue”, he complained. Zelenskiy said he was enormously proud of Ukrainians who defended their country from Russia’s attack. “They are heroes,” he said. He also praised the media, describing them as “apostles” in the battle for truth at a time when Russia was bombarding its population with lies and disinformation. The president said the war had brought his citizens together. It had also given the European Union a sense of common values and Nato fresh strategic purpose, he suggested. “We have unity. We need weapons,” he said, before disappearing up an escalator back to his presidential office. On Thursday the US promised $800m in more weaponry for Ukraine. Biden said he would ask Congress for more money and pledged to send heavy artillery, dozens of howitzers, and 144,000 rounds of ammunition, as well as tactical drones. “We’re in a critical window now of time where they’re going to set the stage for the next phase of this war,” Biden said, referring to Russia’s attack on the Donbas. The US and its allies were “moving as fast as possible” to provide Zelenskiy with the equipment and weapons he needed, Biden added. Zelenskiy will meet the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and and the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, on Sunday. In another development on Saturday, Turkey announced it was closing its airspace to Russian civilian and military planes flying to Syria. The announcement marks one of the strongest responses to date by Turkey, which has cultivated close ties with Moscow despite being a member of the Nato defence alliance, to Russia’s two-month military assault on Ukraine. “We closed the airspace to Russia’s military planes – and even civilian ones – flying to Syria. They had until April, and we asked in March,” Turkish media quoted the foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, as saying. Çavuşoğlu said he conveyed the decision to his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, who then relayed it to Putin.",News/World news,"Ukraine will ask US for more heavy weapons to defeat Russia, Zelenskiy says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/ukraine-will-ask-us-for-more-heavy-weapons-to-defeat-russia-zelenskiy-says
4/24/2022,"If there is any decorum left in the world, the Game of Thrones showrunners will have just sent a gift hamper to Killing Eve. Because, just three years after Game of Thrones caught heat for delivering what was widely thought to be the worst series finale of all time, Killing Eve may well have just toppled it. If you missed it, you missed one of the most abrupt endings to any series since Quantum Leap concluded with a brief caption explaining that the lead character never returned home (while also misspelling his name). The story, or what was left of it, was all cleaned up. Eve Polastri and Villanelle, having finally succumbed to the will-they-won’t-they tension, had defeated the bad guys and enjoyed a passionate kiss. And then, out of nowhere, Villanelle was shot and fell into the Thames and died, leaving Eve to scream in anguish as the words THE END filled the screen. And, boy, are people angry about it. They’re angry about the deviation from Luke Jennings’ source material, which ended with Eve and Villanelle living together in happiness. They’re angry about the show’s reliance on the Bury Your Gays trope, in which gay characters are seen as more expendable than their heterosexual counterparts. Perhaps more than anything else, they’re angry about the shoddy storytelling and precipitous drop in quality. From every conceivable angle, it couldn’t have gone worse. However, the Killing Eve finale might just be saved by one thing. The fact that I just had to describe the ending to you is a good sign that Killing Eve had become an irrelevance long before it ended. Which is a shame, because it started so well. The scripts (courtesy of Phoebe Waller-Bridge) were taut and sparkling with the sort of complex female longing that doesn’t often make it to screen. It revived Sandra Oh as a going concern in Hollywood. It made Jodie Comer into a star overnight. For a while, Killing Eve was all anyone could talk about. But slowly that all fell away. Waller-Bridge left after the first season, to better concentrate on world domination. The second (still very good) season was run by Emerald Fennell, who left to go and win an Oscar. But this churn meant that the audience had to recalibrate to a third point of view in as many seasons, which is an exhausting thing to do, and this year’s fourth season brought on yet another. Every behind-the-scenes change gave the audience a new opportunity to bail, and most of them did. It all contributed to the sense that Killing Eve was just a stepping stone, a thing people did on the way to bigger and better things. Oh has moved on to Pixar movies and hosting the Golden Globe awards, while Comer is already happily carving out a career as a leading lady of note. Now, I have to be honest here. I didn’t enjoy the final season of Killing Eve at all. Its focus was all over the place, as if it had forgotten why anyone liked it in the first place. But, that said, I kind of loved the ending. The way it clattered to a halt on such an unrepentant eff you – one character dead, another screaming and not even a hint of a denouement to help viewers process their shock – was one of the most boldly absurd things I’ve seen in a long time. I actually laughed out loud at the audacious bluntness of it all. But there’s a reason for my reaction: like plenty of others, I haven’t really cared about Killing Eve for years now, which meant I could watch the finale with a kind of detached amusement. Those who clung on to the programme through thick and thin won’t have my level of detachment. You have to be massively invested to forgive a degradation in quality this obvious, and so the only people standing at the end were Killing Eve diehards. To them, the finale was an almost unforgivable betrayal. What a waste of everyone’s potential.",Arts/Television & radio,An unrepentant eff you: why I loved the audacious Killing Eve ending ,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/23/killing-eve-finale-series-bbc
4/24/2022,"Twitter chose Earth Day to announce it will ban advertisements that deny the scientific consensus on climate crisis. “We believe that climate denialism shouldn’t be monetized on Twitter, and that misrepresentative ads shouldn’t detract from important conversations about the climate crisis,” the company declared on Friday. “We recognize that misleading information about climate change can undermine efforts to protect the planet.” The company did not specify whether the change would affect what users post on its site, but did say it will provide additional information in the coming months on its work to “add reliable, authoritative context to the climate conversations” that are happening on its platform. It said its approach would be informed by sources such as the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Reports. Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have been the venues for a growing wave of climate change denialism in recent years. Online conversations regarding the climate crisis on Twitter are increasingly being reshaped by automated bots, according to researchers: one Brown University study two years ago found that bots were responsible for a quarter of all statements regarding the climate crisis. Certain topics saw higher proportions, such as 38% of tweets about “fake science” and 28% of all tweets about ExxonMobil, the oil company with a history of climate denial. Last year, Twitter rolled out a new strategy known as “pre-bunks” during the UN’s climate conference to counter climate misinformation. It described them as “hubs of credible, authoritative information” regarding the climate crisis and are available in the Explore tab, Search and Trends, the company said. Friday’s announcement from Twitter follows in the footsteps of other major tech company moves, including from Google and Meta, to address climate change denial on their platforms. In October, Google prohibited ads that “contradict well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change.” Meta also launched a Climate Science Center that features accurate information on climate change for users. Last fall, the company announced a $1m investment into its new Climate Misinformation grant program. Meta will use the money to invest in “proposals that build alliances between fact-checkers, climate experts and other organizations to support projects that focus on combating climate misinformation”, it said.",News/Technology,Twitter uses Earth Day to announce ban on climate denialism ads,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/23/twitter-bans-ads-deny-climate-crisis
4/24/2022,"British artist Sonia Boyce won the Venice Biennales’ top Golden Lion prize with her work Feeling Her Way, which combined video, collage, music and sculpture. Boyce is the first black woman to represent the UK. Her work features videos of five black female musicians who improvise and play with their voices. “The rooms of the [British] pavilion are filled with sounds – sometimes harmonious, sometimes clashing – embodying feelings of freedom, power and vulnerability,” according to the British Council, which commissioned the work. The biennale’s five-person jury commended Boyce for raising “important questions of rehearsal” as opposed to perfectly tuned music, as well as for creating “relations between voices in the form of a choir in the distance”. The jury said of the installation: “Sonia Boyce proposes, consequently, another reading of histories through the sonic. In working collaboratively with other black women, she unpacks a plenitude of silenced stories.” After the ceremony, Boyce told Artnet News her collaborators’ performances were born out of a simple question: “As a woman, as a black person, what does freedom feel like? How can you imagine freedom?” The work features musicians Jacqui Dankworth, Poppy Ajudha, Sofia Jernberg, Tanita Tikaram, and composer Errollyn Wallen as they take part in a studio recording session. Following rooms feature the individual performers, creating an evolving, overlapping soundtrack as the audience passes through the pavilion. The British Council’s director of visual arts, Emma Dexter, said Boyce’s work was the “perfect selection for this significant time in UK history”. Boyce first attended the Biennale in 2015, she was a part of curator Okwui Enwezor’s “All the World’s Features” exhibition. In her acceptance speech, Boyce thanked the late curator, who offered her early encouragement.
