3/1/2022,"Lithuania has called on the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague to open an investigation into potential war crimes committed by Russia and Belarus in Ukraine. Lithuania’s prime minister, Ingrida Simonyte, told the Washington Post: “What Putin is doing is just a murder and nothing else, and I hope he will be in The Hague.” With evidence mounting of Russia’s use of indiscriminate cluster munitions on Ukrainian cities, and the leveling of residential buildings in Kharkiv in particular, the government in Kyiv is also preparing a case against Moscow to take to The Hague. The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, is expected to open an investigation in the coming days. Khan, a British lawyer, issued a statement on Friday recalling that Ukraine had given the court the authority to investigate war crimes since 2014. He said his office “remains fully committed to the prevention of atrocity crimes and to ensuring that anyone responsible for such crimes is held accountable”, adding he would make a more detailed statement on his return from a work trip to Bangladesh. Ukraine has also taken Russia to the international court of justice (ICJ) for having launched an invasion on the pretext of false claims of genocide perpetrated against the country’s Russian speakers. David Bosco, an expert on international justice at Indiana University said the ICJ submission “is kind of a symbolic move by Ukraine”. “That’s not going to yield very much because it’s not actually clear that ICJ is going to have jurisdiction,” Bosco said. “And then even if they do, it’s something that would take a long, long time.” But several groups have started to collate war crimes evidence for use for future trials at the ICC or elsewhere. Eliot Higgins, the founder of the Bellingcat investigative journalism agency said it was working with other organisations to preserve evidence that would be accepted in court. “We’ve been working on issues related to accountability using open source evidence for a long time, so we’re very familiar with the needs of stakeholders like the ICC,” Higgins said. “Our goal would then be to make that data available to any accountability process that wants to use it. We aim to have, at a minimum, date and geolocation data, and then work to add other data, such as the type of violation documented, munitions featured in videos, etc.” Khan’s predecessor as ICC prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, announced in 2020 that there was enough evidence from the conflict in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to launch an investigation but the ICC judges did not give their approval. Bosco said that in the wake of the Lithuanian submission, Khan would not have to seek the judges’ approval to launch a new investigation, and so could move swiftly to start work. “If the ICC is going to investigate, that means from their perspective they have jurisdiction over any Russians on Ukrainian territory and over any crimes committed on Ukrainian territory,” Bosco said. “But it’s got to be either war crimes, crime against humanity or genocide.” The Rome statute, the ICC’s founding document, was amended in 2018 to include the crime of aggression. However, in his statement, Khan said he did not have jurisdiction to investigate that crime because neither Russia nor Ukraine are signatories to the Rome statute.",News/World news,ICC urged to investigate possible war crimes in Ukraine by Russia and Belarus,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/ukraine-russia-belarus-war-crimes-investigation-the-hague
3/1/2022,"As markets opened in a panic on Monday, many Russians rushed to local cashpoints in Moscow to retrieve their savings before the damage got any worse. “It said they had dollars so I came here immediately,” said Alexei Presnyakov, 32, pointing to an app for Russia’s Tinkoff Bank, indicating he could withdraw hard currency. About 20 people were queued in line. “Yesterday [the rate] was 80 [to the dollar]. Today it’s 100. Or 150.” “I just made a spontaneous decision today that I would ask [out of work] and go around until I took out all my money,” he said. “Before it was worth zero.” Within minutes, however, the word traveled down the queue: the dollars were gone. Nearly half the queue walked off. “Who needs roubles?” one woman said sarcastically as she walked away. From shopping malls to corporate boardrooms, Russians were trying to find their footing on Monday in what the Kremlin described as the “altered economic reality” that the country was now facing following sanctions on Russia’s Central Bank and other key financial institutions. There were signs that something extraordinary was taking place: the Moscow Exchange, Russia’s largest stock market, has halted trading until 5 March. With its reserves frozen, the Central Bank announced it would more than double its main interest rates to 20%, the highest this century, and force major exporting companies, including large energy producers like Gazprom and Rosneft, to sell 80% of their foreign currency revenues, effectively buying roubles to prop up the currency rate. But that did little to calm the frayed nerves at the Metropolis Mall in Moscow, where there were signs that Russians were rushing to turn their cash into consumer goods before prices leapt up. At an M.Video, a popular electronics store, one employee said that rouble prices for iPhones were “the same for now” but that “they could change any minute.” “I’d buy now,” he said. If there was shock on the streets, then the mood among the business community was even more dour. Several owners of mid-sized companies said that the invasion and subsequent isolation of Russia had made their businesses unprofitable overnight. One, the owner of an advertising services company with 100 employees, said that he was about to announce to his employees this afternoon that he is leaving the country for Armenia with his wife and two sons. “I’m going to tell them that we are going into a crisis that we have never experienced before,” he said. “It’s like flying on a plane with no engines or the engines are on fire.” His company, which handles contracts for international brands like Pepsi and automakers like Volkswagen, was booming as recently as January 2022, a record month for them. Now many of those brands were pulling out of the Russian market and his business was shrinking “immensely”. Another business owner with hundreds of employees in the food and beverage and tourism industries felt that he was completely in the dark about the future under Vladimir Putin. “We have no fucking clue what he will do next,” he said. “No one in the business community has a clue any more. Everyone is so depressed. I have experienced so many economic crises here, the pandemic being the latest. “But there was always a reason to keep on fighting for your business,” he said. “Now, I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel any more. Even if peace is achieved, the damage is done. How do we reverse it?” There was a sense on Monday that this crisis was passing the point of no return, as Russian bombers began flying over Ukraine and rocket artillery began firing on populated districts of Kharkiv, a Russian city of more than one million people. Even top Russian business people, including the powerful oligarchs, appeared to be unsettled by the instability ushered in by the invasion, as well as the extraordinary measures being taken to prop up the rouble. Oleg Deripaska, the billionaire businessman, had called for peace “as fast as possible” in a Telegram post on Sunday. On Monday, he went after the Central Bank decision to hike rates, taking aim at longtime rival Elvira Nabiullina, the head of the Central Bank. “A hiked rate, the mandatory sale of foreign currency … this is the first test of who actually will be responsible for this banquet,” Deripaska wrote. “I really want clarifications and intelligible comments on the economic policy of the next three months.” By the evening, the answer was even more draconian measures, including strict limits on transfers of money abroad. Those were announced after a funereal meeting between economic officials and Vladimir Putin, who declared that the sanctions had been imposed by the western “empire of lies”. For many Russians, who felt themselves to be European by the food they ate and the way they lived, it’s clear that Monday marked a moment when the war came home. “I think people are going to feel scared to spend money,” said the entrepreneur who owns restaurants and tourism companies. “We have left communism 30 years ago, we got accustomed to having a lot of comforts that are also seen in the West. All of that progress can be gone. We are no longer a member of the international community.”",News/World news,‘The damage is done’: Russians face economic point of no return,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/the-damage-is-done-russians-face-economic-point-of-no-return
3/1/2022,"With the untimely deaths of Jamal Edwards and now drum’n’bass MC Skibadee (AKA Alphonso Bondzie), it’s been a rotten week for British music. It’s tempting to say a bad week for Black British music – and certainly their contributions to the development of specifically Black British vernacular musical forms were unparalleled. But both had influence all the way through the underground and mainstream beyond any single genre or scene. Having contributed significantly to the rise of stars from Ed Sheeran and Jessie J to Stormzy and AJ Tracey, Edwards’s achievements have been well-documented. Skibadee’s influence is less immediately visible – after all, he only featured on a scattering of tracks in his almost 30-year career. But as the intensity of the tributes has shown, it was immense nonetheless. “His contribution to drum’n’bass can never be equalled,” said chart-topping producer DJ Fresh; figures within the scene have referred to Skibadee as the “greatest of all time”. But perhaps the most important summation came from outside drum’n’bass. The grime and dubstep innovator Plastician tweeted: “Skibadee was your favourite MC’s favourite MC’s favourite MC … Can’t underestimate the foundations that guy built for everything we’ve had since then.” And it’s true: Skibadee changed the nature of what it meant to be an MC or rapper in the UK, laying the foundations for grime, drill and everything else that followed. There is not a British grime or rap artist today that doesn’t owe him a creative debt. He came from a generation raised equally on Jamaican sound system music and US hip-hop. But where 80s UK rappers and dancehall deejays struggled to escape the gravity of the vowels of those respective countries, the birth of jungle out of rave in 1992 created a rhythm that was 100% British, and MCs at raves created something completely new, too. The likes of Det, Moose, 5-0 and Navigator pioneered a style that brought the “fast-chat” dancehall rhythm (itself a British innovation in the 80s) together with hip-hop wordplay and an “oi-oi”, punky, cockney twang. Two stood out especially: Stevie Hyper D (who also died tragically young in 1998) and Skibadee, who started hosting raves in 1993. Their verbal dexterity, crowd control and force of personality was honed in the white heat of raves and over hour upon hour on pirate radio. While those skills didn’t necessarily translate to the contained track format, they were mind-boggling and thrilling to witness when experienced live over an extended duration. Those skills were picked up in turn on stage and on pirate radio stations by a younger generation: Wiley, Dizzee Rascal, Riko Dan, Flowdan, D Double E, Footsie – the founders of grime. They all crossed paths with Skibadee and his peers in stations such as Kool and Rinse in the mid-late 90s – and even though they jumped ship to garage and then turned it into grime, the closeness was always there. Just witness Dizzee and D Double E’s facility at drum’n’bass’s 170 bpm tempo when they appeared with Skibadee – at his invite – on Kool FM in 2007; or D Double’s latest hit, Selecta with Danny Byrd, an unabashed tribute to the “jump up” production and MCing of the mid-90s. But it wasn’t just about musical technique. The tributes to Edwards were every bit as much about his personal conduct and personality – how he inspired people in person – as his material achievements. It’s the same with Skibadee. With their rowdy image and lyrical content, it’s easy to forget that jungle and drum’n’bass were forged and gained their longevity from fast friendships built around this love of the musical experience. Skibadee exemplified that. Colleagues and fans have been sharing how much he contributed with his presence and love for other artists. As Kaptin Barrett, head of music at Boomtown – the festival that’s become a hub for all things jungle – put it: “I swear Skibadee loved MCing more than anybody else, never lost that passion for it in all the years I’ve seen him. He would jump up on countless sets at Boomtown just for the love, no matter who the DJ was.” And that is what makes Skibadee as vital to the history books as any musician with a hundred times as many recorded tracks to their name. Over hundreds of hours a year, at raves, clubs and radio studios, he provided a torrent of language and music that transmitted ideas, feelings and stances, directly and only to the people who experienced the sets in full. His voice still echoes through every UK rapper you hear today and his influence endures in the living, breathing global drum’n’bass culture.",Arts/Music,Skibadee changed the very nature of what it meant to be an MC or rapper in the UK | Joe Muggs,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/28/skibadee-changed-the-very-nature-of-what-it-meant-to-be-an-mc-in-the-uk
3/1/2022,"Some of the many British-based volunteers heading to fight in Ukraine say they are willing to die to protect the country from invading Russian forces. “I’ve spent most of my life enjoying myself, so if I die tomorrow I’ve had a good life,” said one man, 57, who would only give the name Konch. He is planning to drive to Ukraine this week in a convoy of vehicles from the UK. Konch, a security contractor who grew up in the Midlands, added: “A lot of the other guys I’m going with are ex-forces, but there some that have never fired a water pistol in their lives. Anyone with half an ounce of integrity can’t help feel moved by what’s happening. If Ukrainians are willing to stand up and fight, then so can we.” Vincent Barnett, 54, from Leicester, fought in Afghanistan and is under no illusions about the dangers of going. “It’s a one-way trip, but I’m prepared for that. I just need to sort out my finances first,” he said. The senior bus mechanic added: “My wife doesn’t want me to go, but I’m so passionate about it. I just feel sorry for those people who haven’t got the fighting skills of people who have served. I watch it every day on the news. “I’ve made my decision, I want to go, and if someone sponsored me I’d go tomorrow. My daughter thinks I’m a nutter.” But for a Ukrainian lorry driver, Petro Symchych, 48, volunteering to fight is a “duty to our homeland”. He was speaking outside the Ukrainian social club in London before heading off in a car laden with donated supplies. He insisted he was not scared despite the overwhelming military might of the Russians. “Sooner or later we all die,” he said. Symchych has been reassured by defiant video messages posted by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “At the beginning I wasn’t sure we could trust him, but his videos mean we have started to trust him and he’s proved himself by his actions.” Symchych is travelling with Viadmir Bucoros, 44, a friend from his home town of Kolomya in western Ukraine. Bucoros, who has been working as a welder in London, said: “You can’t sit still and not do anything. Even British guys are helping, so as a Ukrainian it is my duty to go back and defend my homeland.” Bucoros, a keen hunter, added: “I’m a good sniper.” He said his 20-year-old daughter was also keen to return to Ukraine and join up with a paramedic group. But he added: “She should stay and finish her education, otherwise she would be coming with me.” Symchych and Bucoros are just two of the dozens of British-based Ukrainians being supported by the Ukrainian social club. The venue in Holland Park usually hosts social gatherings for the Ukrainian diaspora and Saturday language classes for their children, and has now become a makeshift supply depot. “We are supplying them with rucksacks, body armour, helps and first aid kits,” said Iryna Estevez, 39, who has turned her skills as a travel company director to arranging journeys for volunteer fighters. “There are over 50 people on the list of people going this week,” she added. They include Anzhela Razina, 47, a former female athletics champion who has been working in the UK as an electrician. She is returning to Ukraine with a group of 10 on flight via Poland on Monday. “When you see your family needing help you have to go and help. I will try to fight if I can,” she said. Not everyone travelling from the UK was going to fight. Tom Dutton, 42, who runs a carpet business in Morecambe, was planning to drive a borrowed van filled medical aid in the next two weeks. Once he arrives he plans to help as many people as he can to leave the country. Dutton, who spent time in the navy, said: “I’m not going to fight, but I will if I have to – I just want to help get as many people as I can.” Dutton said he made the decision to go after watching news footage of a young girl in Ukraine crying for help. “She was a similar daughter’s age and you could just see the fear in her eyes. I never cry but I was bawling my eyes out and I just messaged my missus to say: ‘I’m going to Ukraine.’” James Fern, 38, an ex-army medic who runs a medical support company, is raising funds to drive a donated ambulance from London to Ukraine. He plans to arrive by the middle of next week. “It just something I do,” he said. “I’m on autopilot right now. I imagine I’ll be staying there and assisting with the administration.” Nevertheless, he is wary of volunteer foreign fighters. Fern said: “I’m tired of war tourists. I had to deal with many of those in Iraq and they are just a pain. I’ll be there for medical assistance – it’s a humanitarian instinct.”",News/World news,‘It’s my duty to go’: the volunteers leaving the UK to help Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/its-my-duty-to-go-the-volunteers-leaving-the-uk-to-help-ukraine
3/1/2022,"Shell is to exit its joint ventures with Russian state energy firm Gazprom, a day after BP said it would offload its 20% stake in Kremlin-owned oil firm Rosneft, as British businesses scrambled to distance themselves from Vladimir Putin. The oil company said it would “exit its joint ventures with Gazprom and related entities”, which are worth about $3bn. The planned sales include its 27.5% stake in the Sakhalin-II liquefied natural gas facility, its 50% stake in the Salym Petroleum Development and the Gydan energy venture. Shell will also end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, in which it holds a 10% stake worth $1bn. Germany, which was due to double its Russian gas imports via the pipeline, had recently called a halt to the project in the light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “We are shocked by the loss of life in Ukraine, which we deplore, resulting from a senseless act of military aggression which threatens European security,” said Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden. The company said its staff in Ukraine and other countries have been working together to manage the company’s response to the crisis locally. It will also work with aid partners and humanitarian agencies to help in the relief effort. “Our decision to exit is one we take with conviction,” said van Beurden. “We cannot – and we will not – stand by. Our immediate focus is the safety of our people in Ukraine and supporting our people in Russia. In discussion with governments around the world, we will also work through the detailed business implications, including the importance of secure energy supplies to Europe and other markets, in compliance with relevant sanctions.” At the end of 2021, Shell had around $3bn in non-current assets in its Russian ventures. “We expect that the decision to start the process of exiting joint ventures with Gazprom and related entities will impact the book value of Shell’s Russia assets and lead to impairments,” the company said.",News/World news,Shell to exit joint ventures with Gazprom and pull out of Nord Stream 2,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/shell-to-exit-joint-ventures-with-gazprom-and-pull-out-of-nord-stream-2
3/1/2022,"A police officer’s son accused of the 1994 murder of six-year-old Rikki Neave has denied he belatedly revealed he had picked up the schoolboy on the day of his disappearance in an attempt to tailor his account to fit the discovery of his DNA. James Watson was 13 at the time it is alleged he killed Rikki in Peterborough on 28 November 1994, jurors have been told. Watson, now 40, was charged with the boy’s murder after his DNA was allegedly found on the youngster’s discarded clothes. Taking the stand at the Old Bailey in a short-sleeved shirt and dark tie, Watson accepted being seen with Rikki on 28 November 1994 when both children should have been at school. The jury has been told Watson was interviewed as a witness in December 1994 but did not mention that he had picked up Rikki until he was interviewed by police again about 21 years later in 2015. During his later interview, police appeared “taken aback” that he knew what DNA was, the defendant said. He explained that he knew about it after being diagnosed as HIV positive in 2009. Asked why he did not mention it before, Watson said: “I believe I picked him up today but I cannot remember.” The defence barrister, Jennifer Dempster QC, said: “Was any part of your answer in 2015 ‘I may have picked him up’ an attempt to tailor your account to fit the DNA in the case as it emerged later?” Watson denied it. Watson told jurors that was the “first and only time” he had met Rikki and spent about four minutes with him. According to his statement at the time, Watson had gone to the Welland Estate and was watching a digger when Rikki approached him at 12.30pm. He denied going to the woods where Rikki was found strangled, stripped and posed in a star shape, but said it was a place he would go when he lived with his father on the Welland Estate. Watson had been taken into care after his father, a serving officer with Cambridgeshire police, was arrested and subsequently jailed, the court was told. He could not stay with his mother because of the person she was living with, the jury was told. Watson said: “It was not my fault that I had to leave and go into care.” He told jurors that he later became involved in animal rights when he and a boyfriend lived in Cambridge. He added that he had always wanted to be a vet but did not have the qualifications, and was “really proud” that he passed an Open University course in animal care while in prison. The jury has previously been told of Watson’s previous convictions for sexual assault, theft of a police uniform and unmarked police car, and the smashing up of a children’s home. He denied having an unhealthy interest in dead birds and young children. Dempster asked about a claim that he kept a “bespoke” clothing catalogue, featuring young children in underwear, in his room when he was in care. Watson replied: “Absolutely not.” On the claim that he kept the carcass of a pheasant in his room at the same children’s home, Watson said he was against “animal cruelty” but found the iridescence of pheasant feathers “fascinating”. Earlier, in an opening address, Dempster told jurors there was “simply no evidence” that Watson was in the woods for about two hours, during which time it is alleged he killed, stripped and posed Rikki. Watson, of no fixed address, denies murder and the trial continues.",News/UK news,Rikki Neave murder accused denies tailoring DNA evidence,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/28/rikki-neave-accused-denies-tailoring-dna-evidence
3/1/2022,"I am one of that first generation born post-Holocaust. My parents came here as German Jewish refugees from a horrific and murderous regime that wanted to wipe them from the face of the earth. My grandparents failed to make it out and were exterminated in a concentration camp. I remember the stories of my father being interned in the UK as an “enemy alien”. Not allowed to work, not allowed to take up arms, subject to racial abuse from people who wrongly thought he was a Nazi. And now, as we watch the horrific events unfolding in a country only around three hours’ flying time from here, I see the same response from this government towards the people of Ukraine (Ukrainians denied entry to UK despite being eligible for visa, 28 February). Only a “select” few Ukrainians are being allowed to come here. Only those with family, or those who might be willing to pick fruit. The doors are once again being held partly and reluctantly open.Carol HedgesHarpenden, Hertfordshire  I came to Britain as a refugee student from Prague in 1968 when the Soviet army and its Warsaw pact allies invaded Czechoslovakia. The invasion of Ukraine brings back memories. Britain welcomed me with generosity, kindness and compassion; it enabled me to complete my university education, become a history teacher and integrate fully in the British way of life. I have been grateful to Britain ever since. Will Britain now show the same compassion to the refugees from Ukraine and welcome them as it once welcomed me?Zuzana CrouchBristol  I have an idea regarding the oligarchs and their dirty money and properties in London.

Brief history lesson: in April 1649, common land on the hill was occupied by a group known as the Diggers, who are often regarded as early exponents of communism.Margaret FarnworthLiverpool  At the weekend, the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, was asked if she was in favour of young people volunteering to fight in the Ukraine (Report, 28 February). Her reply was yes. This not only contravenes the advice given by her own department, but is irresponsible in the extreme. To encourage young persons, many of whom will be untrained, is completely ridiculous. One has to wonder what she will say to the grieving parents when their children return maimed or in body bags. I know we have learned not to expect too much common sense from this government, but this latest piece of advice is, to my mind, foolhardy and dangerous.Dr Trefor StockwellBodorgan, Anglesey  The insistence on the “correct” pronunciation of Kyiv seems to be driven by guilt about colonialism and the suppression of identities (How to pronounce and spell ‘Kyiv’, and why it matters, 25 February). The argument needs to be tempered by an acceptance that there is no obligation to pronounce foreign place names precisely in the manner of the locals. For example, the English pronunciation of the capitals of France, Italy and Spain is not at all the same as the local pronunciation. It works both ways: ask a French person, an Italian and a Spaniard to name the capital of England and you will get two different spellings and three different pronunciations.Michael BrookNevada City, California, US  Oliver Bullough, take a bow (Boris Johnson claims the UK is rooting out dirty Russian money. That’s ludicrous, 25 February). He cuts to the quick of the tragedy we are seeing unfold in Ukraine and our complicity in laying the ground for such a denouement. No hindsight here though; it’s all happened in plain sight. We’ve known for long enough that Vladimir Putin is a danger. We’ve known that looted Russian money, extracted from the collapse of the Soviet Union, was flowing through London unchecked. And since that union’s demise in 1991 – the supposed end of the cold war, remember – we’ve watched as our former foes have embraced a feral capitalism, hiding behind the muscle of authoritarian states, fuelled by populist nationalism. All the while, countries across the west, but especially the UK, have trumpeted the triumph of western values while cosying up to the Russian kleptocrats and, crucially, their money. These political donations were designed to buy influence, silence and, ultimately a bogus legitimacy. If our values are so easily corrupted, what point is there in defending them? As Bullough concludes, we need to invest in the future of democracy, not just rhetoricise about it now that it’s threatened.Colin MontgomeryEdinburgh  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/1/2022,"Steve Borthwick has underlined the effort and sacrifices made by the Leicester Tigers scrum-half Ben Youngs to break the England men’s appearance record on Saturday. “He’s brilliant, absolutely brilliant,” was the Leicester head coach’s assessment of Youngs, who went past Jason Leonard after coming on as a 62nd-minute replacement against Wales, earning his 115th cap for his country. “I think we all know what a quality player he is. For me the thing that stands out is being able to perform at that level for that length of time. And what that takes. Not just for him but for his family as well. “All of his family must be so proud of him. We’re very proud of him. We’re just delighted for him.” Youngs’ services were not needed at club level this weekend as Leicester beat Gloucester 35-23 at Welford Road – their 15th win from 17 matches – to move 16 points clear at the top of the Premiership table. But Borthwick will hope the Rugby Football Union releases Youngs to compete in London for a second week in succession when Leicester take on second-placed Saracens away. “They’re the best team in the league,” Borthwick said of the club he represented 144 times, captaining them to their first league triumph in 2011 when they beat Leicester 22-18 at Twickenham. “Look at the squad they’ve got, the resources they’ve got, how long the team has been together. They’ve got incredible ability.” Saracens did not play this past weekend and this will be the third time this season the Tigers will face a team fresh from a bye. Borthwick would not be drawn into an exchange on the matter – “I don’t write the fixture list,” he grumbled – but it does make his task that much more difficult, especially if he will be without internationals Ellis Genge, Freddie Steward, George Ford and Youngs who all helped England see off Wales 23-19. Then again, perhaps not. The last time they met on a rainy day in Leicester, Saracens had enjoyed their first bye of the campaign. It didn’t help.

3/1/2022,"Sometimes it is obvious when an attempt is being made to destroy a democracy. Tanks rolling across a border and missiles striking cities don’t leave much room for doubt. But threats can be both more subtle and a slower burn. Last week, the elections bill cleared its first hurdle in the House of Lords (UK elections watchdog warns bill threatens its independence, 21 February). During the debate, peers queued up to set out their concerns about the impact on the independence of the Electoral Commission – the elections watchdog – once Michael Gove is setting its strategy and policy. It is a dangerous power to put into political hands. Lord Grocott deployed a footballing analogy to make his point and hit the spot: “To allow the winning party to give instructions to the Electoral Commission is comparable to a game between Arsenal and Manchester United in which, prior to kick-off, the Arsenal manager gives instructions to the referee.” This move goes expressly against the recommendations of the committee on standards in public life. It was also criticised by the Conservative-led public administration and constitutional affairs committee, which concluded that it “risks undermining public confidence in the effective and independent regulation of the electoral system”, and by the chair of the Electoral Commission, John Pullinger, and the majority of electoral commissioners in an open letter to ministers. Peers are the last line of defence against plans to take control of the body that manages elections and fines political parties for rule breaches. We urge them to be as forceful in defending democracy now as they were during discussions about the police bill, which saw the government defeated 14 times.

3/1/2022,"Val Robinson, who has died aged 80, was one of Britain’s best hockey players, appearing 149 times for England and 21 times for Great Britain over more thn two decades from 1963 to 1984. During that period she was better known than anyone else in her sport – male or female – and added to her fame when she twice won the BBC’s Superstars competition, in 1979 and 1981, by roundly defeating strong fields of much younger elite athletes. Fairly small at 5ft 5in and weighing 9st, but supremely fit and tough, Robinson was a midfielder with attacking intent whose main aim was to serve up scoring opportunities for her teammates by dribbling through the opposition. Devastatingly quick, with a trademark body swerve and the ability to keep the ball glued to her stick even on bumpy surfaces, she played with her head up, on the lookout for the killer pass or an opening that would allow her to essay a mazy run. For much of her career the England women’s hockey team had an annual televised fixture at Wembley Stadium, often attended by 60,000 or more fans, many of them schoolgirls on what the Guardian’s hockey correspondent, Nancy Tomkins, characterised as “a combination of pilgrimage and jamboree”. Each year for two decades Robinson was their idol, heralded by a crescendo of screams every time she set off on one of her marauding adventures. The first woman to play 100 times for England, her final tally of appearances was a record at the time, and given that she played in an era when internationals were much less frequent, is probably equivalent to, or maybe even better, than the 375 England caps attained more recently by Kate Richardson-Walsh. Robinson’s participation in Superstars – which attracted millions of viewers in its heyday – did as much if not more to raise her profile as her exploits on the hockey field. She was in her late 30s when she featured in the 1979 event, and on account of her age was largely overlooked as a serious contender. However, she came out such a convincing winner that she was omitted from the following year’s competition because the BBC felt she had taken some of the excitement out of the show. Reinvited in 1981, by which time she was 40, she won just as comfortably at her second attempt. Still intimidatingly fit, Robinson continued to play hockey at international level for three more years, and was able to remain competing at the highest club level into her 50s, before retiring to concentrate on running a hockey training centre. Born in Accrington, Lancashire, to Doris (nee Kay), a cotton-mill weaver, and Bill Walsh, a polisher, she first played hockey aged 14 at Accrington high school for girls, by which time she was already a notable all-round athlete. Her first interest was in football, playing for Accrington Ladies as a teenager and joining Preston Ladies in 1959, where she caught the eye of the Manchester United manager Matt Busby, who declared her the best female footballer he had ever seen. In 1961 she went to train as a PE teacher at Chelsea College of Physical Education in Eastbourne, and by the following year had decided to concentrate on hockey. She won her first England cap in 1963, and taught PE in Ellesmere Port in Cheshire before marrying fellow teacher Gwyn Robinson in 1965, moving south with him to Bedfordshire, where she became head of girls’ PE at Stratton school in Biggleswade and played for the Parkside Ladies club in Bedford over the next 15 years. After initially struggling to establish herself in the England side, Robinson became a constant presence from 1965 onwards, missing only one of the big Wembley matches between 1966 and 1984. She helped England to victory in the 1975 World Championship in Edinburgh, and in 1978 was called up to the newly created Great Britain team, which was targeting participation in the 1980 Olympics in Moscow – women’s hockey having been included in the Games for the first time. In the event, however, her team withdrew in support of a US-led boycott against the Soviet Union, and her only realistic chance of featuring in an Olympics had gone. By then Robinson’s profile had been raised considerably through her 1979 appearance in Superstars, in which she won five out of the six events designed to test all-round sporting prowess. Her 1981 win was all the more remarkable not just because of her relatively advanced age, but because she had been laid low just before the event after an industrial accident near her home had exposed her to a cloud of poisonous gas. Unable to eat for three days, even in her weakened state she was able to romp away with the trophy for a second time. Robinson celebrated both victories with her customary post-match beer and cigarette, having sustained a smoking habit for many years without any noticeable impact on her natural fitness, apart from a “nasty cough in the morning”, although she did quit soon after the poisoning incident. Her international hockey career ended in 1984,and the following year she was appointed OBE. But her club hockey went on until 1998, playing to a high standard well into her 50s for Great Harwood/Blackburn Northern, where she proved, as always, to be a dedicated club member. She and Gwyn had built their own house in the village of Guilden Morden in Cambridgeshire in the 1960s, using self-help books. But in the early 80s they gave up teaching and moved back north to set up a residential hockey centre at Foxhill Bank House in Accrington, where Val ran coaching courses for school, club and county teams, and Gwyn looked after the catering and hospitality. Gwyn died in 2020.

3/1/2022,"My colleague and friend Marilyn Malin, who has died aged 86, was a doyenne of children’s literature, both as a publisher and as an agent. For many years the managing director of Methuen Children’s Books, she was fair and considerate, generous spirited and open to new ideas – indeed, she was ahead of her time. As well as being an excellent caretaker for the Kenneth Grahame and AA Milne estates, she was responsible for the acquisition of many notable titles, including several early books by Floella Benjamin (now Lady Benjamin), and stories and poems by the then unknown Caribbean writers James Berry and John Agard. She was a real talent spotter – she saw the potential of War Horse by Michael Morpurgo, which she published in Magnet, Methuen’s new paperback list, in 1983. It went on to become both a hugely successful play and film. In 1985 Marilyn left Methuen and for a few years published many of her loyal authors under an eponymous imprint at André Deutsch. Her drive was incredible, and in 1989 she established herself as a literary agent – Marilyn Malin Consultancy. Thin and appearing stooped through scoliosis, Marilyn’s apparent physical frailty belied a mind as smart as a whip. She continued to attend the Bologna and Frankfurt book fairs and travelled indefatigably to the US. As an agent she was a champion for her authors – really pushing and standing up for them as the many testimonies from them confirm. She never retired. Born in Golders Green, north-west London, Marilyn was the daughter of Irene (nee Littenberg) and Albert Malin. Having fought in the first world war, her father went into the furniture business. She went to North London Collegiate school and after winning a state scholarship attended the University of London. She then joined the children’s publisher Blackie as a secretary in the late 1950s. In the early 60s she moved to Methuen Children’s Books as assistant to the renowned publisher Olive Jones, became an editor, and, when Olive retired in the late 60s, managing director of the company. Though Marilyn came from an Orthodox Jewish family (her Littenberg grandfather was an acclaimed cantor at the Dunstan Road synagogue in Golders Green), she considered herself an agnostic. Writers whom she admired and whose views she identified with in particular were Primo Levi and Isaiah Berlin. Marilyn was an intellectual in the truest sense of the word. She made a deep impression on all who knew her. She is survived by her sister Shirley.",Arts/Books,Marilyn Malin obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/28/marilyn-malin-obituary
3/1/2022,"Prominent figures in Germany are coming under increasing pressure to publicly distance themselves from Vladimir Putin amid accusations that they are bringing shame on the country and themselves. The range of so-called Putin-Versteher (Putin-understanders) – those who have sought to explain or justify the Russian leader’s actions – include figures from the far-left Die Linke and the far-right AfD, as well as members of the Social Democrats and some conservatives who have tried to keep him on side in the interests of their constituents and German energy security. “Putin-Versteher are on the precipice,” the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Sunday (FAS) said, listing an array of German politicians it said were now paying the price for having mistakenly thought they could “tame Vladimir Putin with empathy and friendly accommodation”. The tabloid Bild went further, describing a range of politicians as “Putin Streichler” – or Putin caressers – saying over the past 20 years these included not just former chancellor Gerhard Schröder, but the former Social Democrat foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, now Germany’s president, the former state leader of Bavaria, Edmund Stoiber, and Angela Merkel, who it accused of pushing the building of Nord Stream 2 and holding back with sanctions even amid widespread evidence of Kremlin misbehaviour. But the invasion of Ukraine has marked a turning point, with analysts concluding that many politicians had been stunned into a change of heart. Germany’s former defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer implied that some Germans, including herself, had taken a shamefully naive approach towards Putin’s politics. “I’m so angry at ourselves for our historical failure,” she wrote on Twitter. “After Georgia, Crimea and Donbas, we have not prepared anything that would have really deterred Putin.” But many German politicians actively courted Putin, most prominently Schröder, who went out of his way to emphasise the Russian leader’s harmless clubbability. Schröder, who is reportedly recovering from coronavirus, was called upon at the weekend to condemn the invasion or face being thrown out of the Social Democratic (SPD) party over his close business ties to Russian energy companies Gazprom and Rosneft. In its strongest appeal yet to Schröder, Lars Klingbeil, the SPD’s co-head, a former close ally, urged him to cut all business ties with Putin. “This war starts with Putin and Putin only, and therefore it can be the only logical conclusion that you cannot do business with an aggressor, a warmonger,” Klingbeil said. Rainer Arnold, a former MP and an SPD member who was the parliamentary group’s spokesman on defence between 2002 and 2018, went further, appealing to Schröder to “save the SPD and you yourself further sustained embarrassing and excruciating debates about your egotistical engagement with Putin, a man whose interests are just as egotistical as well as inhuman”. Schröder, who had previously referred to Ukraine’s request for arms as “sabre rattling”, on Thursday called on the “government in Moscow” to end the conflict “as soon as possible” saying it was not in Russia’s security interests to pursue the conflict. But he stopped short of mentioning Putin or referring to a war. Others associated with Nord Stream 2 appear to be rapidly distancing themselves from the project, which was halted by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, (also of the SPD) last week in direct response to the invasion. Within the far-left Die Linke, Sahra Wagenknecht has admitted she was wrong to insist Russia was not planning to invade Ukraine. Insiders have said she had been forced into a rethink, particularly over sanctions, which she has rejected in the past. Stephan Protschka of the AfD told the FAS he felt “deeply deceived” by Putin, which elements of his party have admired for standing up to the “imperial west”. He told the paper he had, at most, expected there to be a trade war between Russia and the west and had accordingly “stocked up with wood” for his oven heater in order to brave an energy crisis. “I had had a degree of understanding for the way in which Putin felt he had been driven into a corner,” he said. “But now my understanding has run out.”",News/World news,Germany’s ‘Putin-caressers’ start coming to terms with their naivety,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/germanys-putin-caressers-start-coming-to-terms-with-their-naivety
3/1/2022,"“Iwas sitting on the bench thinking: ‘Bloody hell, I’m enjoying this,’” Munir El Haddadi said, and it would only get better. He had been inside the bus as it moved slowly through the smoke on the short trip to the Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium; now he was alongside the pitch, unable to sit still as his Sevilla teammates made their way through Real Betis quite a lot quicker. With the noise rising round them this was a moment to be part of and, sooner than expected, he was sprinting off in the sunshine, laughing as the substitutes he had just left behind ran towards him. Munir had been on the pitch for only 10 minutes, a first-half substitute replacing Papu Gómez after half an hour. Now the Moroccan had had put Sevilla 2-0 up and the place went wild. Better still, with Betis not scoring until Sergio Canales’s superb free-kick in the 94th minute, he had put them on course for a 2-1 victory they would celebrate as if it was something much, much more than a match. Not least because it was. The Seville derby is always special, this time maybe even more so, plenty of reasons why their manager slipped to his knees at the final whistle, why the players threw their shirts into the crowd and set off on a lap of honour, why their sporting director was almost in tears. It had been so loud, intense and competitive, so much fun, the anthem sung at the start and the end, silence never falling, that Ivan Rakitic said: “Experiencing this, seeing the supporters, anyone who wasn’t a Sevilla fan became one.” Their league results under Julen Lopetegui – no defeats in six – might have suggested the same, but Betis would have a word or 32 to say about that, which is the way it should be. Second against third, Sevilla and Betis hadn’t come into any of their 137 meetings better placed. Sevilla arrived unbeaten in 11 league games, while Betis had been more fun to watch than anyone in 2022, scoring four goals four times in five weeks. Both clubs are still in the Europa League, with the final at the Pizjuán, and there’s still a chance they could both win something in the same season for the first time since 1935, when Betis took the title and Sevilla the Copa del Rey. This time, Betis start their Copa semi-final second leg on Thursday 2-1 up against Rayo Vallecano, while Sevilla are the only likely candidates for the league alongside Real Madrid. In recent weeks they had looked a little less like one, doubts creeping in, the hint of an opportunity lost. Rakitic could have put Sevilla just one point behind Real with a last-minute penalty at Osasuna but his shot was saved. Although they are unbeaten since visiting the Bernabéu in November, Sevilla had drawn four of five and came into the derby nine points behind after Real had won at Rayo on Saturday night, the stakes high. Some suggested something was missing, that they didn’t go for teams enough, preferring to wait for their moment rather than seek it. There was a lingering suspicion they just couldn’t take that final step, pressure building on Lopetegui as if this is a team that should win the league. “There’s this odd atmosphere around us; we’re second and it’s as if it’s not enough,” Rakitic said. Lose against Betis, drop points, and most thought that would be it, all over. Betis had already knocked them out of the Copa – the game abandoned and completed behind closed doors the next day after a plastic flagpole was thrown which hit the Sevilla midfielder Joan Jordán – now they could knock then out of the league, too. Not only that: win and they would be just two points behind Sevilla, ready to take second off them. Injuries were a big part of Sevilla’s problems, the absentees almost in double figures for months now, a minor miracle they were still standing at all. If they didn’t always go full throttle, some of that was about fatigue. Erik Lamela and Suso have started just 11 games between them. Youssef En-Nesyri has started eight. On Sunday Jesús Navas started his first since October. Jules Koundé was out. Even the new signing Antony Martial was absent, as if the bad luck was contagious. Diego Carlos lasted until half-time. “He shouldn’t even have warmed up but we took a risk; I take my hat off to him,” said Monchi, the sporting director. Which was when Munir came on to experience on the pitch what he had enjoyed from off it. By then, Sevilla led and were flying. If there had been doubts before, there were none now. Roared on by the crowd is a cliche but it is true. Sometimes going for it isn’t a choice; knowing that doing so for 90 minutes is impossible, you can choose to hit this moment or that one, or it can just happen. “This is my sixth derby, the first I’ve experienced here with fans,” Lopetegui said. “The context is big. Making a calculation is difficult. Sometimes whether you get there or you don’t, you press [or not], comes from the fans: that’s the energy they give you.” Sevilla thundered into the match. There were two penalty shouts in two minutes, the scene set; three shots within seven; a fourth in the next minute, corners racked up fast, the first confrontation not far behind, players piling in. Diego Carlos and Borja Iglesias crashed into each other like bumper cars, the Sevilla defender winning that battle and every other battle too. It was 7-0 in shots on the half-hour, the volume ever louder. Marcos Acuña launched into Nabil Fekir – “I lost my head,” he said – and Sevilla just kept coming. “I wasn’t surprised by Sevilla, I was surprised by Betis,” Manuel Pellegrini said. “I don’t know why we were like that. It hurts. We weren’t ourselves,” Canales, the Betis captain, said. Sevilla were, only stuck on fast forward. It only took 15 minutes for them to lead. An outrageous chip and chase and then pass from Tecatito sent En-Nesyri through and he was taken out by Claudio Bravo. For a brief moment, everyone took the breath they needed and Rakitic did what his wife and kids had told him to do when he left the house that morning: scored, the release saying it all. This was fun, exhilarating enough just to watch, and when Munir joined in the second came. It might not have been what he was looking for but Yassine Bono’s goal kick went right through – too fast for Betis and the television cameras too, who missed his assist – and Munir was on to it, his left-foot shot sliding past Bravo’s hands. The Pizjuán erupted, Munir slapped his chest and ran, the bench vacating as they went after him. It was done. Well, not done exactly, but ultimately it was enough. “It was two games,” Pellegrini said afterwards and if Betis took the second 1-0 it wasn’t enough. Joaquín came on for Fekir to face Navas in a derby for probably the last time, 17 years after the first. Except that on this evidence Joaquín can go beyond 40, changing Betis who made chances – for Álex Moreno, Marc Bartra and Cristian Tello. The first-half storm had been enough and Lopetegui said that Sevilla had “administered the pain and the drop in energy well”. Betis didn’t find a way through until virtually the last kick, the noise deafening at the end. “I hadn’t played a derby with fans here and it’s twice as good,” Acuña said. When the whistle went, Lopetegui repeatedly punched the air, roaring “Come on!” He leapt into Monchi’s arms and they held each other tight. When he joined the players celebrating at the north end, the fans chanted: “Julen, Julen, Julen Lopetegui.” It was the first time he had been embraced quite like this and he held his heart and blew them kisses. Sitting there looking exhausted afterwards, throat sore, eyes too, however much it had meant, and it had meant a lot, he said this wasn’t about him; it was about the players. And, above all, the people.

Monchi said: “The demands on this team are great because it has become a ‘big’ team. Sometimes it can seem like what we do isn’t enough. Today was important and it’s lovely to be able to celebrate it with our people. In the end, it’s football and those of us who work in football have one main obligation: to make people happy. For these fans to go home happy is even more valuable to me than the three points.” If they were going home, that is. “It’s going to be a long night,” Munir said with a smile.",Sport/Football,Sevilla seize their chance in derby to keep unlikely title hopes alive | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/28/sevilla-seize-their-chance-in-derby-to-keep-unlikely-title-hopes-alive
3/1/2022,"As the government acts to squeeze Russian oligarchs in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Boris Johnson has promised to rush forward plans for a new public register, revealing the ultimate owners of properties across the UK. The government had previously failed to act, despite the vast offshore leak known as the Pandora Papers revealing last year the details of 1,500 UK properties owned through secretive offshore companies, some of them connected to senior Russian figures. The data showed that the family of Russian oligarch Mikhail Gutseriev – who was placed under sanctions by the UK, EU and US last year – owned more than £50m of property in the City and West End of London (though representatives of his family insisted he had no interest in the assets). In total, it has been estimated that £170bn-worth of UK property is held overseas, much of it anonymously: whether to avoid publicity, tax, or worse. Many of these anonymously held properties are concentrated in London – in particular in Westminster and Kensington. Making their ultimate owners public is aimed at helping law enforcement agencies track what Johnson called “dirty money” – but will also increase transparency for civil society groups and journalists. The new register will apply retrospectively to property bought up to 20 years ago in England and Wales, and from 2014 in Scotland. Entities that do not declare the beneficial owner will face restrictions on selling the property, and people who break the rules could face up to five years in prison. It is far from a new idea: the UK has had a publicly available register of beneficial ownership for companies – the People with Significant Control register – since 2016. The same approach is gradually being extended to British overseas territories, after intensive campaigning by a cross-party alliance of backbenchers, including the Conservative former development secretary Andrew Mitchell and former Labour minister Margaret Hodge. The long-awaited property register is unfinished business from a crackdown begun almost a decade ago. When the UK chaired the G8 in 2013, David Cameron told the global elite at Davos, the annual Swiss shindig for business leaders and politicians, that governments should be “shining a light on company ownership, land ownership and where money flows from and to”. He talked about wanting to tackle the “travelling caravan of lawyers, accountants and financial gurus” who support the hiding of vast sums of wealth. Three years later, in 2016, Cameron hosted an anti-corruption summit in London, at which he announced his intention of introducing a property register. “The new register for foreign companies will mean corrupt individuals and countries will no longer be able to move, launder and hide illicit funds through London’s property market, and will not benefit from our public funds,” a government press release said at the time. At the time Cameron was being questioned on if there was a conflict of interest between his policy to crack down on aggressive tax avoidance and a Panama-based investment trust his father had set up which did not have to pay UK tax on its profits. Cameron had once owned shares in the trust but had sold them in 2010 because he said he “didn’t want anyone to say you have other agendas or vested interests”. Since then, however, successive administrations have dragged their feet, and the measure has never been enacted – despite Theresa May’s government getting as far as including it in a draft bill in 2018. Robert Barrington, professor of anti-corruption practice at the University of Sussex, says there are two possible explanations. “One is that the government have not accorded it the priority, because of Brexit and so on. The other is that it has been blocked, because of interests.” Over the six years since the plan was first mooted, he says he has increasingly come around to the second of these. “I don’t know whether it’s the Treasury, the City, oligarchs making donations to political parties; but there is a block in the system.” Whatever internal opposition there may have been, however, appears to have been abruptly swept away by Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and the resulting desire, as Johnson put it last week, to “squeeze Russia from the global economy, piece by piece”.",News/Business,Boris Johnson promises UK property register to expose kleptocrat money,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/28/boris-johnson-promises-uk-property-register-to-expose-kleptocrat-money
3/1/2022,"Universities must “strongly discourage” sexual relationships between staff and students, according to official new guidance aimed at tackling staff-to-student sexual misconduct in higher education. The recommendations fall short of banning relationships between consenting adults, but where they occur staff should be removed from all responsibilities where there could be a conflict of interests. The new guidance drawn up by Universities UK, which represents the sector, acknowledges universities have been too slow to address the problem of staff-to-student sexual misconduct. It warns vice-chancellors against using non disclosure agreements (NDAs) – or confidentiality clauses – to silence complainants in settlement agreements in cases of sexual misconduct or sexual harassment. The guidance calls on universities to create an inclusive and positive culture, backed up by clear policies, practices, reporting and data, to support and protect students when they make complaints and prevent future staff-to-student sexual misconduct. “Our universities have been too slow to address this issue, which affects every institution,” said Prof Cara Aitchison, the vice-chancellor of Cardiff Metropolitan University and the chair of the advisory group that drew up the guidance. “We must now be seen to make rapid progress to right this wrong. Preventing and addressing staff-to-student sexual misconduct is, fundamentally, about doing the right thing. We also need to act to comply with a legal duty of care, and to safeguard the reputation and position of our universities.” The report says there is limited evidence on staff-to-student sexual misconduct, but research by the Guardian, the National Union of Students and the 1752 Group, which has led the way in the battle to end staff sexual misconduct in higher education, has raised concerns about the scale of the problem and the way in which universities deal with it. According to the report, titled “Changing the culture: tackling staff-to-student sexual misconduct,” the vast majority of complaints are made by female students about male staff, postgraduate students are more likely to be targeted than undergraduates, and the issue often goes unreported. It damages educational experiences and can lead to students dropping out, while the use of NDAs can help perpetrators to move from one university to another with their reputation intact and the same person can end up offending in multiple institutions. On staff-student relationships and the unequal balance of power, it says: “While we recognise the autonomy of universities, given the power differentials and professional relationship between staff and students, we recommend that close, personal relationships between staff and students are strongly discouraged by universities. “This is especially important where there is a direct professional responsibility. Where relationships do occur, the staff member should be removed from all responsibilities that may entail a perceived or actual conflict of interest and/or abuse of power. “Universities should, where appropriate, and in accordance with data protection and human rights legislation, require staff members to declare any close, personal relationships they have with students, for whom they have a direct responsibility. A failure to declare can be treated as a disciplinary matter.” Michelle Donelan, the minister for higher and further education, said more than 30 universities have so far signed up to a pledge she launched in January to end the use of NDAs, adding: “Universities have a profound responsibility to protect students from sexual misconduct, especially when perpetrated by those in positions of power such as a member of staff, so I welcome this timely guidance.”",News/Education,UK universities ‘too slow’ to address staff-student sexual relationships,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/28/uk-universities-too-slow-to-address-staff-student-sexual-relationships
