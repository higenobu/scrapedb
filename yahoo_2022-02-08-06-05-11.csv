2/8/2022,"Oversold stocks are what their name implies: stocks that have traded lower than they should, based on their fundamentals. It’s a subjective measure, of course; after all, for every seller, there’s a buyer. The key to success in buying into an oversold stock is recognizing when it’s getting near the bottom. These stocks typically make a comeback, even if they take their time about it. But once they do bounce, the potential for strong gains is very real. We can check with Wall Street’s stock analysts to find which bargain-priced stocks are primed for gains. Once we know which stocks the experts recommend, we can start digging into their details. The data tools at TipRanks are ideal for this, letting us sort out stocks by a wide range of factors. The stock data plus the analyst commentary will together paint a comprehensive picture of any stock – a vital step before investing. So let’s put that into practice. We’ve looked up the details on two stocks whose price is close to a one-year low – but which all have a Moderate or Strong Buy rating from the analyst community, and a one-year upside potential of at least 40%. Let’s take a closer look. PJT Partners (PJT) We’ll start with a look at global investment advisory firm PJT Partners. Founded in 2015 by Morgan Stanley’s Paul Taubman, PJT has quickly become one of the industry’s most prestigious investment banking and advisory institutions. The company has been involved in mergers & acquisition worth a combined $600 billion-plus in its short history, including the $59 billion T-Mobile/Sprint merger in 2020. While the firm is consistently profitable, its shares are down by 30% from the peak they reached this past October. To start with, in 2H21, the company has shown revenues and earnings that are down year-over-year. Management described 2020 as ‘an extraordinary run up’ in reference to the firm’s business and described 2021’s environment for the firm’s core business as ‘a challenging market backdrop.’ These comments came in the context of the 4Q21 report, which showed top line revenue, at $313 million, down 3% year-over-year. EPS, at $1.52, was down 16% yoy. In line with the company’s historical patter, Q4 showed the highest quarterly results of the year. For the full year 2021, revenues came in at $991 million. This was down from $1.05 billion in previous year. At the same time, despite the drop-off at the top and bottom lines, PJT saw fit in Q4 to raise its common stock dividend. The payment, which had been set at 5 cents, was quintupled to 25 cents per common share. At that rate, the dividend annualizes to $1 and yields a modest 1.5%. The key point to consider is not the yield, but large jump in the payment. Covering the stock for Seaport, 5-star analyst Jim Mitchell writes that he remains bullish on PJT, including among his reasons: ""1) given our greater confidence that restructuring revenue has bottomed, investors now have positive optionality should higher rates, supply chain disruptions, etc. create more restructuring opportunities; 2) momentum in strategic advisory (now PJT's largest business) is strong heading into 2022, with new mandates doubling in the past two years; 3) Park Hill, which is highly leveraged to growth in alternative assets, also has a strong and growing pipeline..."" ""We don't believe the LT growth story is over for PJT, out year estimates are more defensible than most, and at 10.9x 2023E EPS vs. a 5-year average of 17x, the stock seems materially oversold,"" the top analyst summed up. Overall, Mitchell believes this is a stock worth holding on to. He rates PJT shares a Buy, and his $94 price target suggests ~49% upside potential. (To watch Mitchell’s track record, click here) Are other analysts in agreement? Most are. 1 Hold rating is trounced by 3 Buys, and therefore, the message is clear: PJT is a Strong Buy. Given the $91.50 average price target, shares could surge ~45% in the next year. (See PJT stock forecast on TipRanks) CalAmp (CAMP) The second stock we’ll look at, CalAmp, is a change of pace from the finance industry. CalAmp deals in connected intelligence, applications, hardware, and cloud computing that make IoT function. The company’s products, from edge computing devices to subscription-based apps in vehicle tracking and management, have found niches in corporate fleet and supply chain administration. CalAmp boasts over 1 million software and services subscribers, and more than 20 million installed devices worldwide. At the end of December, CalAmp’s stock fell sharply, dramatically accelerating a more gradual decline from the previous several months. For the past year, the stock is now down 50%. The immediate cause of the drop was a financial release for Q3 of fiscal 2022 that failed to meet analyst expectations. The company reported $69 million at the top line, down 12% yoy. EPS, which has been positive for fiscal 3Q21, turned negative with an 8-cent per share loss. The conventional wisdom had expected a revenue total of $77 million and a positive EPS of 8 cents. The company management cited the ongoing supply chain bottlenecks in the company’s quarterly miss. However, there were some bright spots. CalAmp’s software and subscription services gained a combined 7% year-over-year; while not enough to counter the overall hit, it was enough to prompt some analysts to maintain their bullish stance on the stock. Among them is Michael Walkley, a 5-star analyst from Canaccord Genuity. “We believe CalAmp shares are well oversold and present an attractive risk/reward profile. While part of the selloff followed disappointing November quarter results due to supply chain issues, we believe CalAmp’s strong recurring revenue business more than supports the current valuation even if applying no value to the profitable and strategic hardware business. In fact, we estimate CalAmp will generate roughly $150M in C2021 software and subscriptions services revenue.” Walkley doesn’t hold back, and gives the stock a Buy rating with a $14 price target. If correct, the analyst’s objective could deliver one-year returns of ~147%. (To watch Walkley’s track record, click here) All in all, the recent reviews on CAMP, breaking down to 3 Buys, 1 Hold, and 1 Sell, give the stock a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Shares are priced at $5.67 and the average price target of $11.24 implies a one-year upside of 30%.

2/8/2022,"Americans flocked to states with low or no income taxes during the pandemic, according to a new report, reaping savings from their work-from-home flexibility. “People move to states with low-income tax for a multitude of reasons, sometimes it's the most direct and obvious reason that it reduces their own tax liability,” said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects with the Center for State Tax Policy at the Tax Foundation. “Especially now that people have more capacity to move where they want, that will be a higher priority for some.” States with higher income tax rates saw significant population declines, whereas states with lower taxes had accelerated population growth, according to the Tax Foundation analysis that used U.S. Census Bureau population data and commercial datasets from U-Haul and United Van Lines. For example, the District of Columbia — which raised income taxes in 2021— saw its population downsize an estimated 2.8% between April 2020 and July 2021, while New York, which has some of the highest taxes, lost 1.8% of its residents. This was followed by Illinois, Hawaii, and California — all high-tax states — which make up the top five states with the largest population losses. By contrast, low or no personal income tax states saw the biggest population increases, including Florida, Texas, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Nevada, and Tennessee. While the last two years of the pandemic have allowed people with increased mobility to make this move, high tax levels are not the only reason some have packed up a U-Haul, according to Walczak. “There are also second-order effects,” Walczak said. “States with lower tax burdens and with more pro growth tax codes have higher rates of growth and higher economic opportunity – and people will move to seek out those things even beyond their own tax burdens.” While no or low income states may have higher sales or property taxes, the total tax burden often remains lower. Take Texas, for example, which has higher property taxes than the average. “But even then for most people, the combination of Texas’ higher than average property taxes and no income taxes is still a significant tax savings over most of the states they might have moved from,” Walczak said. Nine states with population gains either implemented or enacted cuts to the individual or corporate income tax rates last year. Meanwhile, New York, which had the highest population loss, and D.C. actually raised income taxes in 2021 — the only places to do so. Local taxes can also add to people’s overall tax burden. For instance, the analysis found that the average top marginal state and local income tax rate is 3.5% for states that saw population gains, while the rate is 7.3% for the third of states with the highest tax rates. “I’m one of the people that’s trying to leave New York City to minimize tax burdens,” said Ramona Cedeño, CPA and founder of FiBrick, an accounting firm for tech companies and small businesses. “Just up north of New York in the county of Westchester. New York can be so expensive.” If she relocated, she could save around 5% to 6% on taxes, she said. A growing number of young, working people are moving across state lines due to flexibility from work-from-home arrangements. “In the past before COVID, we stayed in these high-tax states because there was another reason to. My office was based in New York City and I had clients in California, which required me to be there physically,” Cedeño said. “Now that we can work remotely and you don’t have to see clients all the time, you can live anywhere.” Typically, state-to-state migration is led by retirees leaving colder and high-tax states for ones with low or no income taxes that often have warmer climates. Not now, necessarily, Walczak said. “This isn’t a migration of just retirees, but more and more a migration of people looking for better economic opportunities,” Walczak said, “people moving or looking for jobs, lower cost of living, lower taxes, and overall opportunity.” Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Money.

2/8/2022,"Homebuyers got crushed last year as home prices soared at their highest clip on record. Housing economists saw that price growth—which peaked at a year-over-year rate of 20% last year—as simply unsustainable. Their economic models agreed: Among the seven forecast models reviewed by Fortune heading into 2022, every single one predicted home price growth would slow significantly this year. But over the past few weeks, that consensus is no longer so unified. Now, more industry insiders are throwing out their previous forecasts and replacing them with more bullish short-term outlooks. Indeed, some experts say the 2022 spring housing market might go down as one of the most competitive on record. Look no further than Zillow. Back in December, the home listing site predicted that U.S. home values would climb 11% this year. Economists at Zillow now say that forecast is too conservative. Their latest forecast finds home prices are set to spike 16.4% between December 2021 and December 2022. If it comes to fruition, it would mark another brutal year for home shoppers. Why is Zillow raising its 2022 home price growth forecast? A lot of it boils down to housing inventory. During the pandemic, inventory plunged to a four-decade low as more buyers rushed into the market. That trend was predicted to reverse late last year as forbearance protection programs lapsed and mortgage rates rose. But not only has that not happened, the inventory situation has gotten worse. In January, there were just over 923,000 U.S. homes listed for sale on Zillow. That’s down 40.5% from the pre-pandemic level in January 2020, and down 19.5% from January 2021. Simply put: The housing market is tighter right now than it was last year when bidding wars climbed to an all-time high. That explains why Zillow foresees a rough few months ahead for home shoppers. But there is a big wild card: As the Federal Reserve shifts policy to help tame inflation, its moves will indirectly result in higher mortgage rates. In fact, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate in January already spiked to 3.56%—up from 3.11% in December. That marks the biggest one-month jump in mortgage rates in more than nine years. In the short term, more buyers might rush into the housing market in order to lock down rates before they go higher. But in the long term, higher mortgage rates would put downward pressure on price growth. Why? As mortgage rates rise, some buyers get locked out of the market altogether. “Downside risks to our forecast remain,” write the Zillow researchers. “Elevated inflation heightens the risk of near-term monetary policy tightening, which would result in higher mortgage rates and weigh on housing demand…Higher rates are exacerbating buyers’ struggles with affordability, and they might dissuade some existing homeowners from moving, by raising the monthly mortgage cost of even those homes priced similarly to their current homes. By dampening both buyers’ and sellers’ appetite in this market, rising rates could drive down sales volumes this year, with uncertain effects on home prices.” Homebuyers and sellers alike would be wise to take Zillow’s 16.4% price growth prediction—or any other real estate forecast model—with a grain of salt. After all, none of the major real estate forecast models predicted the historic home price boom we’ve seen over the past two years. Indeed, when the pandemic struck in spring 2020, Zillow and CoreLogic both predicted home prices would fall by spring 2021.
