4/12/2022,"A Texas student, who thought she graduated No. 1 in her high school senior class four years ago until officials realized they made an error in calculating the rankings and dropped her to the third spot, is preparing to leave college with almost no loan debt. She walks away with the financial blessing thanks to a GoFundMe campaign that raised tens of thousands of dollars to replace the state benefit she lost by not being the valedictorian at her high school in suburban Dallas. WFAA reports Destiny Brannon raised $40,000 from her crowdfunding effort that she began in 2018 when she discovered she would have to pay for her first year of tuition at the University of Texas at Austin. As a graduating DeSoto High School senior, Brannon had been relying on a Texas state law that states if a student graduates with valedictorian honors from a high school accredited by the Texas Education Agency, their first-year tuition at a public college or university will be waived. However, after the commencement ceremony where she received the valedictorian recognition and gave the class speech, the young scholar was informed the district had miscalculated the class end of the year transcripts and her actual position landed her in third place. The high school calculated the final rankings based on grades from the 2017 fall semester, rather than the 2018 spring semester. At the time she said, “It’s embarrassing, because I got so much publicity from them on being valedictorian, only to be told that’s a mistake.” Embarrassment aside, she was no longer eligible for the state’s scholarship assistance that would have helped allay the costs for her freshman year at the university which was (at the time) $25,134. Brannon’s mother believed the school revised the rankings criteria in retaliation to Brannon’s graduation speech which criticized the school’s “subpar teachers” and the district’s prioritization of athletics over academics. The teen said in her graduation remarks, “This school year has been a troubling one for me and the DeSoto ISD school system. We were challenged with subpar teachers who honestly weren’t there to benefit the needs of the DeSoto students.” “Unfortunately, DeSoto ISD is plagued with the idea that sports are somehow more important than education,” she continued. “I’m not quite sure how this ideology came about but I do hope for a change.” The district spokeswoman Tiffanie Blackmon-Jones  apologized in a statement to the family and assured them her speech had nothing to do with her mistake, adding, “The district was aware of Brannon’s perspective prior to her speech.” To make matters worse, Brannon’s family was in no place to help her with school costs. They had recently closed on a house. The proud Bevo said, “I was very distraught about the situation because I didn’t know how I would pay for school at the time. I kind of didn’t have a backup plan.” The quick-thinking Brannon started a GoFundMe campaign, accompanied by a social media and press push, to raise the money for school. Her goal was $25,000, but she almost doubled it with the support of sympathetic donors from across the nation. One angel-giver dropped $10,000 into the pot. Brannon said she “made sure to thank everyone who donated,” and remembered how “blessed and overwhelmed” she felt. Additional support came from UT-Austin also. After hearing about her dilemma, the school pitched in by scholarshipping her books and housing for all of her undergrad years. Tuition and fees for in-state undergraduates at UT-Austin, was approximately around $10,600. During Brannon’s matriculation, tuition was bumped up $200 in both the 2018 and 2019 academic years — annual increases of 2 percent — after the University of Texas System approved an across-the-board tuition hike for all of the school’s campuses. Room and board, the soon-to-be graduate says was covered by the university, was $10,804 and miscellaneous expenses added by the school was $4,392. Given these figures, the assistance from UT-Austin allowed the $40K+ to stretch over all four years and for her to earn her bachelor’s in Health and Society from the school’s College of Liberal Arts without financial angst. According to the school’s website, “the central goal of Health and Society is to train students to understand the socio-demographic, cultural, political, and ethical contexts that underlie health behavior and health policy. We expect many of our graduates to move into positions in non-profit organizations, government, international development or the healthcare industry.” After graduation, with her degree, Brannon plans to further her education in the discipline by attending nursing school in Dallas. “They did NOT have to do that,” the 22-year-old says about the school administration’s assistance. “So, I’m very grateful they wanted to help me.”",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,University of Texas Student Who Lost High School Valedictorian Title After School Said It Miscalculated Her Grades Now Expected to Graduate with Hardly Any Loan Debt,https://news.yahoo.com/university-texas-student-lost-high-004700483.html
4/12/2022,"Ukrainian authorities are investigating war crimes in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb that Russia occupied. Last week, Ukrainian authorities unearthed a mass grave where more than 300 people had been buried. Prosecutor Ruslan Kravchenko said that Russia left behind a server with info about the killings. The chief regional prosecutor in Bucha, Ukraine, told the New York Times that Russian soldiers left behind a computer server with potentially damning information as investigators are zeroing in on killings and mass graves in the city. Last week, Ukrainian authorities unearthed a mass grave in the Kyiv suburb, claiming that Russian soldiers killed and buried 360 Ukrainians in a 45-foot-long trench. Journalists who visited Bucha after Russian troops pulled out also reported bodies of civilians in their homes, on the street, and in the suburb's glass factory. Around 35,000 people live in the northern Kyiv suburb. ""We have already established lists and data of servicemen,"" prosecutor Ruslan Kravchenko told The Times. ""This data runs to more than a hundred pages."" Kravchenko added that the killings are being investigated as war crimes and that most of the more than 250 people killed were hit by bullets or shrapnel. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the bodies found in Bucha were ""staged,"" a claim similar to those pushed by Russian propagandists. Serhiy Kaplychny, who works at Bucha's cemetery, told The Times that only two members of the Ukrainian military were killed and buried in the mass grave. A separate visual investigation by The New York Times found that the mass grave was created before Russia pulled out of the suburb on March 30. As troops were driven out by Ukrainian forces, videos and photos of atrocities from Bucha flooded the internet. Kravchenko told The Times that authorities are investigating reports of rape, torture, and executions that took place in Bucha over the month that Russia occupied the city, highlighting that many of the heinous acts were reported to occur at the glass factory. The Ukrainian government has also set up a website, warcrimes.gov.ua, where citizens and reporters have posted over 7,000 photos and videos related to potential war crimes in Bucha and elsewhere in Ukraine.

4/12/2022,"LAWRENCE - It started as a guy sleeping at the wheel of an SUV at a southern Brown County Kwik Trip around midnight. Two weeks later, as police have sorted out their findings, Hobart-Lawrence police say the March arrest turns out to have been the largest drug bust the department has ever made. Among the items seized by police include marijuana and five types of dangerous drugs, enough cash to buy a new car and four handguns. RELATED: 60 pounds? Appleton-area bust involving 'suitcases full' of methamphetamine is one of state's largest RELATED: Untraceable 'ghost guns' pose new worry for Green Bay-area police, threaten to serve as new currency in meth buys At least one person is in jail in connection with the case, which began with the arrest March 29 of a man who nodded off in the driver's seat of an SUV parked at a gas pump island at the Kwik Trip on Freedom Road, just west of Interstate 41. Someone notified sheriff's dispatchers that the driver of a car at the station appeared to have been asleep at the gas pumps for roughly an hour. Officers ""had to wake the guy up,"" Hobart-Lawrence Police Chief Randy Bani said. ""When he woke up, his hands came out of his pocket, and drug paraphernalia was visible."" It's fortunate, police say, that someone made that telephone call. Police say they took thousands of dollars' worth of illicit drugs off the street, as well as four loaded handguns and ammunition. The drug haul was destined for Brown County, and would likely have been sold locally, police said. They wouldn't release the man's name because the investigation is continuing, but Lt. Matt Ronk of the Brown County Drug Task Force said authorities believe the man intended to deal drugs in the county. What was going to be sold? Police said the man's ""stash"" included significant amounts of cocaine, as well as methamphetamine, fentanyl, LSD, marijuana, heroin, drug paraphernalia and about $50,000 in cash. In addition to the illegal drugs, police seized what they called ""a large amount"" of prescription medications and designer pills. Police said the man brought $20,000 to $30,000 worth of drugs into the county, though the value of the substances could reach much higher depending how it is packaged and distributed. Ronk said a gram of cocaine can sell for about $100, while an ounce of the stimulant can fetch between $1,300 and $1,800 depending on how pure it is, where it is sold and other factors. A quantity of illegal drugs will sell for significantly more in Upper Michigan than in northeastern Wisconsin, Ronk said. While the arrest was good news for law enforcement in Hobart and elsewhere in Brown County, Bani doesn't pretend that this arrest will make the use of illicit drugs in the region go away. He said police have seen the flow of drugs into the region increase in the past five years; the same improved highway system that make it so families can reach vacation destinations more quickly also makes it easier for drug sellers to reach customers in the region. Police also confiscated the 2019 Ford Explorer the man had been driving. Such a vehicle can retail for between $28,000 and $35,000 in this region, depending on mileage and condition.
