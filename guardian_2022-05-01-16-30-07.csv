5/1/2022,"A charity that champions the employment rights of pregnant women and new mothers has been dropped from a government advisory board after posting critical tweets. In recent months, senior Tories including the culture secretary Nadine Dorries and her predecessor Oliver Dowden have taken pains to position themselves as champions of free speech, decrying “cancel culture”. So it came as a surprise to Maternity Action, the charity said, when it was removed from the group tasked with advising on workplace discrimination after its director aired her views on social media about the limited scope of the board and a lack of progress. Ros Bragg tweeted: “We have an advisory board looking at ‘non-legislative improvements’ to reduce maternity discrimination which will meet quarterly until March 2023. No action plan. No recommendations for legislative change.” After highlighting recommendations from the sector, she added: “Disappointing”. The charity told the Observer that officials referred to the tweets when it was told it would be removed. The Department for Business, Enterprise and Industrial Strategy [BEIS] has not denied the decision was based on Bragg’s tweets. Heather Wakefield, chair of Maternity Action, said: “We were surprised by our removal from the board, the reasons for which have not been adequately explained to us. BEIS officials were well aware of our criticism of the board’s disappointingly narrow remit when they invited us to join last year. “In July 2019, ministers promised a taskforce to draw up an action plan on keeping pregnant women and new mothers in the workforce. We are still waiting for that action plan.” Labour’s shadow minister for the arts and civil society, Barbara Keeley MP, said: “Rather than sidelining a charity because they don’t like the chief executive’s tweets, the Conservatives should be laser-focused on tackling energy bills and the cost of living crisis.” It was confirmed in parliament on Tuesday that the charity would not be invited to a second board meeting. It was absent from a list of 12 members presented by Conservative MP Paul Scully. Other members include the Fawcett Society, Working Families and Pregnant Then Screwed, whose founder Joeli Brearley said she would be raising the issue with BEIS at the next meeting this month. A spokesperson from BEIS pointed to an earlier statement by Scully, which read: “The Pregnancy and Maternity Discrimination Advisory Board’s purpose is to consider non-legislative improvements to reduce pregnancy and maternity discrimination in the workplace. It is a collaboration between government, employer and family representative groups and the membership needs the right balance between those different groups in order for the board to do its job.”",Lifestyle/Money,UK government drops maternity charity after critical tweets,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/01/government-drops-maternity-charity-after-critical-tweets
5/1/2022,"There are some pieces of received wisdom in horticulture that are so frequently repeated, it can seem as if they simply must be true. Like the idea cacti are hard to kill, despite the fact this is actually incredibly easy to do – just give these desert-dwellers too much water or too little light. The same goes for mint, which is admittedly incredibly vigorous in deep, moist garden borders, but will quickly exhaust itself if grown in a small, terracotta pot without the cool, expansive root run it demands. While there is, of course, a general truth to these statements, there is a risk of over-simplification that can, I think, often set people up for failure. Conversely, there are some groups of plants that have an undeserved reputation for being impossible to grow, despite often being pretty resilient. This can cause people to miss out on the joy of growing them. And to me at the top of that list are indoor ferns. It certainly is true that many of the fine-leaved species, such as the maidenhair fern Adiantum, can struggle to thrive in the dry air of centrally heated living rooms, and can even totally defoliate if you miss a single watering. However, there is a huge collection of other candidates available that are incredibly tough. Ferns are an enormously diverse group of plants that have, over tens of millions of years, come to adapt to a huge range of environmental conditions. While replicating the sky-high humidity of the steep-sided wells that species like Adiantum tend to inhabit, can be a real challenge in the average home, there is a huge range of species which have adapted to growing high on the branches of tropical trees, where any water that falls quickly drains off. These epiphytic species have reacted by evolving thicker, more leathery leaves, coated in a layer of wax to seal in moisture. This means they are far more able to handle both dry air and intermittent watering, making them much easier to care for. I love the bird’s nest fern, Asplenium nidus, from the jungles of southeast Asia, whose glossy, apple-green tongue-shaped leaves can quickly grow from 30cm rosettes, getting on for 1m if given a large enough pot. From a similar region comes the stag horn fern, Platycerium, with an incredible architecture made up of two types of leaves: fountains of antler-shaped fronds that hang down from a nest of shield-shaped ones. If you need any more cool, botanical animals, there’s the hare’s foot fern, Davallia, with a crown of typical feather-shaped fern leaves sitting above muddy, fuzzy, fawn-coloured rhizomes. All three of these grow better if left to dry out slightly between waterings, to mimic the excellent airflow at the roots they get in their natural habitat. I grow some of mine strapped to pieces of driftwood hung in a south-facing window, to take advantage of this, simply dunking them in a bucket once a week to water them. If you did this to a maidenhair fern, it would barely survive the afternoon. But don’t give up on this huge group of wonderful species just because one or two are on the tricky side.

5/1/2022,"There’s a common assumption that when the state gets involved in providing services or investment, it’s to act as a leveller. Whether it’s schools, hospitals or libraries, the job of government is to redistribute opportunities and provide protection to those who fall on harder times. Yet there are some clear instances where state spending actually increases inequality. Take public investment in transport and infrastructure: in the five years to 2019-20, the government spent about £12,000 per person in London, the richest part of the UK, compared with just £8,000 in the north. The most egregious, in-plain-sight example of this is government spending on universities. When young people turn 18, the principle that we should spend more on the education of children from disadvantaged backgrounds gets turned on its head. The state invests an average of £29,000 on the education of each of the 53% of young people who go to university. For the rest, there’s nothing like that available; many launch straight into full-time work, which for those without a degree is dominated by low-paid jobs offering few prospects for progression. It is deeply unjust: significant taxpayer cash channelled towards a disproportionately middle-class group of young people who have enjoyed better opportunities; virtually nothing for those most failed by the school system, such as the relatively high proportion leaving compulsory education without basic levels of numeracy and literacy. This is why I have some sympathy with Tony Blair’s call to increase the number of young people going to university to 70% by 2040. The former prime minister, architect of the 50% target he set just over two decades ago, has provoked a similarly mixed reaction with his new proposal. Some thought it “actively wicked”: the state encouraging more young people to take on debt for degrees of questionable value, with one in five young people estimated to be financially better off had they not gone to university, one in three graduates finding themselves in non-graduate work and degrees a requirement for jobs that wouldn’t have asked for them 30 years ago. But others point out that most graduates earn more than non-graduates, that the UK has significant skills gaps and that many employers won’t look at you unless you have a degree. Would those opposed to expansion recommend against university for their kids? Neither take is quite right. One of the issues with Blair’s original reform was that it took a system of higher education that originated when a tiny proportion of people went to university and expanded it without asking if it needed to be reformed. That has resulted in a system that bakes in existing inequalities much more than it needs to. There are two mechanisms through means by which this happens. First is the social transition to adulthood. For one group of young people, there is government support to move out of home and experience independent living in a safe environment with pastoral care, with people from different backgrounds. It’s an in-between experience, no longer child yet not quite adult. The other group have to carve their route to independence themselves, with no institutional support, in an economy in which the best jobs tend to be in areas with the most extortionate housing prices. Little wonder that education level is fast becoming the most important political divide; new research suggests that going to university is associated with a decline in racist and authoritarian attitudes (as well as a move to the right on economic policy). Then there are the extraordinary levels of social stratification designed into the university system. Universities sort young people according to their academic performance. A young person who gets three As at A-level will most likely be siphoned off to a different institution to someone who gets 3 Bs. There is no justification for why we have a school system in which it is widely recognised that mixed-ability, comprehensive schools produce the best overall results, but a university system in which dropping one A-level grade might mean you have to go to another institution altogether. It comes with huge downsides. Universities award their own degrees, so a 2:1 from one is not equivalent to that from another and employers use university ranking as a rule of thumb for degree quality. Yet the most selective universities have more students from affluent backgrounds, because bright children from poor backgrounds simply do not get access to the same educational opportunities, depressing their A-level performance. So our university system ends up actively funnelling the most socially advantaged young people into the best graduate jobs, regardless of whether having slightly better A-level grades is an accurate indicator of someone’s workplace potential. Of course, the skills someone develops through learning on their degree are useful for the workplace, whether they are transferable skills such as critical thinking or specific technical skills. But it is difficult to know just how much of the value of a particular degree comes from the social transition to adulthood, or the signal the institution you attended sends to employers, or the academic experience itself. What if we were to take the £30,000 the government spends per young person on university and allocate this sum as a lifetime investment in the professional development of every 18-year-old? I doubt we would design from scratch the system we have today. Some might go on supporting the social transition of all young people, perhaps by funding expenses-paid opportunities to volunteer together abroad or in different parts of the UK, or helping them relocate to places with jobs in which they are interested. Some would go on intensive support for those who have left school without functional skills. More would go on degree-level apprenticeships, where young people can simultaneously work, earn and learn skills more closely tailored to the gaps employers need to fill. Some would be set aside for lifetime learning, so that post-18 learning is not one-shot, but something people can dip in and out of for the rest of their working lives. Blair is right that 53% is not enough, but neither is 70%. Instead, we should at least invest the same in every 18-year-old and possibly even tip the balance the other way. But to simply plough the money into an elitist system that shores up class privilege because we lack the imagination to design something different would be a missed opportunity.

5/1/2022,"At 4pm on a Friday afternoon in June 2019, Macy Smith, then 17 years old, was driving alone in a white hatchback near Pilot Mountain in North Carolina. The road twisted through a thick forest and a torrential summer storm lashed down. Macy lost control on a corner and the car hydroplaned, hurtling through the trees and flipping over three times before settling in a ravine. She was flung into the back seat and the vehicle pinned her left arm to the ground. Macy was frantic: she stretched for her phone, but couldn’t reach it. She listened out for passing cars, but it was a remote spot and they didn’t come often. The first went by without stopping, then the next, then a third. It became dark. Macy had lost feeling in the arm that was trapped, and her neck throbbed. By 10.30pm, 28 cars had come and gone. But then the 29th did stop: Macy heard the doors open, and the voices of her stepfather and brother calling her name. They followed the tyre skids down the embankment and her stepfather held her hand through the blown-out sunroof. Macy had kept it together until this point, but now she sobbed. The family had found Macy using the Find My Friends app, which allows users with Apple iPhones to share their location with others. Her mother, Catrina Cramer Alexander, had checked it when Macy hadn’t come home and was not answering calls. They then jumped in their car and followed the pulsing blue dot to the ravine. “Having that location, if we didn’t have that, we would have never known where to look,” Alexander told a local TV station. “I’m certain that that is what saved her life.” What happened to Macy is every parent’s worst nightmare, though mercifully there was a happy-ish ending: Macy had a fractured neck and underwent an operation to repair nerve damage in her arm. But it’s not hard to imagine a worse outcome. What if her phone had smashed? What if it couldn’t get a signal in the forest? “It’s unreal that I survived that crash,” she said afterwards. Find My Friends was unveiled on 4 October 2011, the day before Steve Jobs’s death, and has been installed as standard on Apple products since 2015. But the app was not the first or even the market leader: that’s Life360, which describes itself as a “family safety service” and has received funding from Google and Facebook since it was founded in 2008. Standard location-sharing apps, such as Find My Friends on iOS devices and Google Family Link for Android, give a GPS pinpoint for users, which they can either choose to reveal to others or not. Life360 does that too, but – for a fee – you can activate premium features, such as being notified if someone in your circle has been involved in a car accident, or if they have driven above the speed limit or even gone beyond a set “geo-fenced” area. There is a significant market for these features. Life360 is used by 32 million people in more then 140 countries; it’s currently the seventh most downloaded social-networking app on the App Store and its San Francisco-based company has been valued at more than $1bn. A survey of 4,000 parents and guardians in the UK in 2019 found that 40% of them used real-time GPS location tracking on a daily basis for their children; 15% said that they checked their whereabouts “constantly”. That word “constantly” will send many teenagers into a cold sweat. At best, location-tracking apps can feel like an extension of helicopter parenting; at worst, they might feel like stalking. While all the apps tend to emphasise that they provide security for the child and peace of mind for the parent, some clearly go into deeper, more invasive territory. One, Find My Kids, allows you to activate the microphone on your child’s phone remotely, so you can eavesdrop on their interactions. OurPact gives you access to screenshots of your child’s online activity, “all encrypted for maximum safety”. Bark monitors and scans messages sent from a device, looking for issues such as “cyberbullying, sexual content, online predators, depression, suicidal ideation, threats of violence, and more”. The app claims to “cover” almost 6 million children, and has detected 478,000 “self-harm situations” and 2.5m “severe bullying situations”. Location tracking has become a battleground in many families, bringing up issues of trust, privacy and personal growth. And while the discussion mostly relates to teens, it can start much earlier. Find My Kids, which launched in Russia in 2016 and is now worldwide, notes on its website: “Youd [sic] kid is too young for a smartphone? Use children’s GPS smartwatch!” In the US, the GizmoWatch 2 offers real-time location tracking and is aimed at children as young as three. KIDSnav is pitched at five-year-olds and up and offers GPS tracking and a built-in microphone to listen in on whatever is happening around your child. All parents have to ask themselves what is best for their child. And Macy Smith and her family are in no doubt that location-tracking apps can be invaluable: in fact, after the accident, the family upgraded from Find My Friends to Life360, because of the crash detection and roadside assistance it offers. “I know it’s hard for teenagers to give up your privacy,” Macy told ABC News, “but sneaking out and being places you don’t want your parents to know about is not worth being trapped under a car for seven hours.” In a sense, location-tracking apps have crept up on us. Most parents would agree that planting a chip in your child that monitored their movements and vital signs – as depicted in the Arkangel episode of the dystopian, tech-anxiety series Black Mirror in 2018 – would be a little extreme. But smartphones have put similar technology in all of our pockets and, well, when it’s 12.30am and you want to go to bed and your kid’s not back from their friend’s house, it’s pretty difficult to resist. “If it’s on your phone, why would you not look?” says Sonia Livingstone, a professor of social psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science, who has written extensively on children’s rights in the digital age. “Up till now, parents and children had evolved lots of ways of handling it: ‘Phone when you reach your friend’s… I won’t worry as long as you’re home by 11.’ But now with the apps and tracking, you know everything. So it’s: ‘Why did they go to the shopping centre on the way to their friend’s? They said they were going to this friend, why are they on that side of town?’ Once you’ve got information, it is almost wrong not to look at it.” Not all teenagers find location tracking an invasion of their privacy. Many are happy to share their whereabouts constantly with their friends: Snap Map, a popular, opt-in function of Snapchat, pinpoints the user’s exact position and those in their circle (with alarming accuracy) whenever the app is turned on. Some don’t even mind their parents keeping tabs on their movements. “When I think about it, it makes me feel safe, because I know that Mum or Dad knows where I am,” says Lola Pethybridge, a 17-year-old student from south London. “Or even my brother” – who is two years younger – “if it came down to him having to figure out where I was. It’s just that safety net where you can say, ‘I need help.’ Or, ‘Can you come and get me?’ And the relief of, ‘Oh, someone I trust knows where I am.’” Next year, Pethybridge hopes to go to university – will she turn off the family’s Find My Friends then? “Just judging by my habits,” she says, “I don’t think I will.” The subject of location tracking is a more contentious issue with other families. Alicia Hardy, a solicitor from Petersfield in Hampshire, encouraged her two children, Ben and Louise, to use Find My Friends after hearing about it from her sister who lives in the US. Ben, who was 17 at the time, lasted for about a month. “At that point in my life, I wasn’t necessarily that happy about Mum knowing where I was all the time,” says Ben, who is now 23. He smiles, “I was sneaking out to smoke, so I didn’t want Mum to see that I was leaving school.” Louise, meanwhile, was 14 and went along with her mother’s Find My Friends request; now 20, they both still use it. “I introduced it not because I wanted to catch my kids out doing stuff wrong, because frankly, I did stuff wrong, but for me it was more an anxious-mother thing,” explains Alicia. “Children can be on their phones all day to their mates. But they don’t answer their phone to their parents or text them back. And that’s really, really irritating for parents, because they systematically would not answer for hours. I tend to catastrophise, whereas Marco doesn’t even think about it.” (Marco Hardy, her ex-partner and Ben and Louise’s father, agrees: “I’ve never even looked at an app or even contemplated it,” he says.) By many objective measures, young people face fewer dangers than they did a generation ago, but it probably doesn’t feel like that to their parents. Livingstone has found in her research that daughters are especially likely to be tracked, with concerns about sexual assault and, in recent times, reports of drink-spiking. Many of the apps lean into these worst-case scenarios. One of the add-ons that Life360 offers is Disaster Response: “Evacuation support in case of natural disasters, active shooter events, and more.” Louise Hardy agrees that, at times, location-tracking apps have made her feel safer, but still has some conflict about them. “As a kid you’re meant to do stuff that your parents don’t know about,” she says. “You’re meant to make mistakes, you’re meant to mess up. So them always having an eye on you takes away from childhood a little bit. But Mum is a worrier, so it’s just a case of keeping her a bit sane.” The Hardy family are clearly very open with each other, and that’s important according to Philippa Perry, a psychotherapist and the Observer Magazine’s agony aunt. “Children sometimes want some things to be private,” she says. “I never used online monitoring with my child because she was an adult before I knew about the software. I relied on that old-fashioned method of asking her where she was going. Once she answered me, ‘I’m not telling you.’ To which I replied, ‘Darling, even Dad has to tell me where he’s going so we know where to start the police search.’ Which, luckily, she found reasonable.” For Perry, location tracking, like most technology, is neither good nor evil: what matters is the boundaries you set and all parties being comfortable with the negotiation. “It’s not for an outsider like me to say whether or not to use it,” she says. “Like all things, if you want your children to be open with you and feel like they can tell you anything, don’t react angrily or negatively or dismissively when they confide in you. If you have done this in the past and now you have a mute teenager, try to repair that rupture by telling them where you overreacted in the past without making excuses for yourself and say you’ll do better next time. And do better next time.” Many teens feel a line has been crossed, especially when their parents make location tracking a condition of paying their phone bill. On the online forum Reddit, on boards such as r/insaneparents and r/raisedbynarcissists, kids share horror stories and screenshots of unhinged interactions with their parents. On TikTok, videos instruct users on how to change their phone settings to fool Life360 into freezing their location (“I broke Life360, you are welcome”). On Twitter, a 20-year-old called Cedar Rose from Kansas City recently made an appeal for $3,000 so they could leave home and their “homophobic… anti-vax” parents who track their movements constantly on Life360. “This is my final resort,” they wrote. “I have no freedom in this house, absolutely none. And I can’t take it any more.” To date, Cedar has only raised $510, along with some snide comments that they should “just get a job”. Whether the use of these apps keeps children safer and more sensible is disputed, but there is obviously the potential to impact relationships between parents and their offspring: certainly where trust has been eroded, location tracking is unlikely to repair the damage. A small study in the Netherlands found that teenagers who were monitored were more secretive and less likely to confide in their parents. “If young people want their privacy, they’ll find a way of getting it,” predicts Livingstone. Where there is more widespread agreement, though, is concern about what happens with the data that is collected. Life360, for example, made $16m in 2020 from selling location data (it is how the app keeps its basic model free, the company states). This information might end up with insurance companies, or realistically with anyone who feels there is a value in paying for it. Livingstone says, “The idea that children are getting a detailed digital footprint not of their own making that tracks everywhere they go, and that’s being used to sell advertising to them now or later, is reprehensible.” It’s no spoiler that in the Black Mirror episode Arkangel, the (well-intentioned) use of location tracking ends in disaster: the abject breakdown of trust and understanding between a mother and daughter. “ In the real world, the experiment – that we have only tenuously signed up for – is ongoing and we will experience the results as they happen, with the fallout felt by our loved ones. “Children have always had times in which they were unobserved and playing outside and generally at risk and coping,” says Livingstone. “We have a crisis in mental health, so it may all be linked that they’re not developing those everyday habits of resilience. But there are some huge unknowns: we have no idea really what it is to grow up when you are constantly observed. So in that sense, we just have to say, we don’t know.”",News/Media,"Honey, let’s track the kids: the rise of parental surveillance",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/01/honey-lets-track-the-kids-phone-apps-now-allow-parents-to-track-their-children
5/1/2022,"Last week the government finally issued a response to the fan-led review of football it commissioned, and everyone in the game is still busy trying to work out what it means. On the one hand it was unarguably a seismic moment. The government, in its response and in the words of the sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, explicitly committed itself to creating an independent regulator. It also guaranteed an enhanced owners and directors test, with an “integrity test” included, promised fans control over their clubs and insisted the Premier League would have to give more money to support teams lower down the football pyramid. Then again there remains no clear definition of what the regulator will do, where it will sit and, even, if “independent” could mean sitting within the purview of the Football Association, whose board is made up of representatives from the professional game. The integrity test remains undefined. With regards to fan representation, plans for a golden share and shadow boards suggested by the fan-led review are in limbo and could be shelved altogether. As for the Premier League’s money, it has been told to offer up more before, with the end result being absolutely no change whatsoever. The government has said there will now be no more detail on the process until the publication of a white paper in the summer, where even the definition of the summer remains uncertain. All of which means speculation – and lobbying – will continue to be the order of the day for some months yet. To understand how unclear things remain, including for the parties involved, consider the Premier League which – on the face of things – is the loser under the week’s announcements. It is opposed to the creation of an independent regulator and believes it gives enough money to the lower leagues already. Any changes, it has long argued, could kill the success of the English top flight, a competition that is the envy of the rest of Europe. In private the league now accepts that an independent regulator is coming. While it has not increased the amount of money it is willing to share, it is discussing how it might be distributed. The offer on the table for the EFL is an arcane one, with payments weighted according to league placing and broken up over three years. It is an idea that may never see the light of day, but it shows – at least to an extent – that the previously all-conquering Premier League is having to change its ways. Many thought its formidable lobbying capabilities would stop reform altogether. That hasn’t happened. Others suspect a long game is being played, that with every month that passes without a regulator in place, the more likely any legislation comes up against the deadline of a general election. The response to that argument is that there is such a political consensus behind the idea of an independent regulator now that if a Conservative government doesn’t do it, a Labour one surely would. This is where the FA comes in. The Premier League would be happy with the FA and not, say, the Financial Conduct Authority, overseeing a regulator. The FA would be happy too. It has been keenly trying to improve its own governance of late, primarily through the appointment of nonexecutive directors in order to prove its suitability. Huddleston seems unconvinced it has changed enough, telling the media it “would be difficult to imagine the circumstances where it would, at least currently, fit the criteria”. But there is briefing going on elsewhere in the corridors of power that it is not too late for the FA to make the grade. At the beginning of April the new chair of the FA, Debbie Hewitt, wrote to Nadine Dorries. Among the issues she addressed with the culture secretary were the possibility of an owners and directors test that held “prospective owners to higher standards than would-be investors in other sectors”, draft regulations that would protect club heritage (one of the key powers of the mooted golden share) and a leading role in negotiating improved redistribution. Were the FA actually to deliver on these things by the “summer”, the end point for this long-awaited and still uncertain reform might finally become clear.",Sport/Football,Questions over Premier League reform remain despite government’s grand plans | Paul MacInnes,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/01/premier-league-reform-questions-fa-government
5/1/2022,"The Arabic title of Franco-Moroccan director Nabil Ayouch’s empowering hip-hop fable translates loosely as “rise your voice”, while in France, where the film competed for the Cannes Palme d’Or, it’s known as Haut et fort ­– “high and loud”. Both monikers perfectly capture the vibrant spirit of this stirring street musical, described by its creator as arising out of “the desire to make a film to give voice to young people”. On one level it’s a patchwork of popular cinematic tropes, combining the strength-through-music themes of films as diverse as 8 Mile and School of Rock with the inspirational classroom formats of everything from Blackboard Jungle to Dead Poets Society. But there’s also a strong whiff of the discursive politics of Ken Loach’s Land and Freedom, mixed with the accessible rebellion of Jafar Panahi’s Offside or Deniz Gamze Ergüven’s Mustang – a heady brew indeed. Real-life rapper turned teacher Anas Basbousi keeps things close to home as new teacher at an arts centre in the Sidi Moumen district of Casablanca, an area still stained by the spectre of fomenting terrorism. On his first day, Anas boldly spray-paints the wall of his classroom, only to be told that it’s not his classroom – it’s a classroom, one that is used by others who don’t necessarily appreciate his rebellious free-form vibe. Tensions increase when Anas meets his class, played by screen first-timers scouted at Les Étoiles de Sidi Moumen (a cultural centre co-founded by Ayouch), whose real lives inspired their fictional on-screen alter egos. As each student takes the floor to show the new teacher what they can do, he dismissively bats aside their efforts, accusing them of failing to use their authentic voices and reducing one misfit to tears for bragging about a life that bears little resemblance to his own. It’s formulaically clear from the outset where this is going, and no one should be in any doubt that Anas’s harsh words are merely an educational provocation, a wakeup call to the youngsters in whom he divines true potential. Sure enough, they soon start to step up, none more so than the young women whose rhymes tell hidden stories, leading to an outpouring of feminist strength that infuriates a zealous classmate nicknamed “the Imam”. Meanwhile, out-of-school lives start to intrude upon the classroom, with outraged parents banning their offspring from attending, leading to moral battles between Anas and his more stuffy superiors. There’s even a West Side Story-style confrontation with oppressive authority. Shot over 15 months, which allowed the project to grow organically, Ayouch’s film retains a gritty authenticity despite embracing often cliched dramatic tropes. Like Clio Barnard’s Ali & Ava, this down-to-earth tale is not afraid of embracing the magical elements of the musical. Yes, the vérité-style camerawork of Virginie Surdej and Amine Messadi creates “the illusion of a documentary” (there are shades of Nicolas Philibert’s Être et Avoir), convincing us that what we see on screen is “real”. But Khalid Benghrib’s sinewy choreography elevates the action above the everyday, creating fusions of poetry and dance that at times put me in mind of Philippe Lacôte’s hallucinogenic Ivorian prison drama Night of the Kings – a very different film, perhaps, but one that similarly blended elements of documentary and fantasia to thrilling effect. With original music by Mike and Fabien Kourtzer and performance scenes that take the cast from the classroom to the recording studio, the stage and beyond, Casablanca Beats (which, like Ayouch’s previous films Mektoub, Ali Zaoua: Prince of the Streets, Horses of God and Razzia, was Morocco’s entry for the Academy Awards) has an infectious energy that pulls us into the ever-changing worlds of its characters.

5/1/2022,"On Wednesday morning Azeem Rafiq’s phone pinged as an email landed in his inbox from a professional sportsman – not a cricketer – seeking his advice about dealing with dressing-room discrimination. Messages like this are not uncommon for Rafiq these days, but the timing of this one was particularly poignant: he received it while he was in Auschwitz, contemplating the most violent and barbaric potential consequences of prejudice. It is a little more than 18 months since Rafiq first spoke to the media about his experiences of racism at Yorkshire, setting off an explosive chain of events that has led to regime change at Headingley, a long overdue intensification of efforts to increase diversity in the county game, and the England and Wales Cricket Board being ordered to “get its house in order” by the sports minister, Nigel Huddleston. The revelations have also been transformative for Rafiq, turning him from a relatively obscure former cricketer into a public figure and campaigner against discrimination. “I feel like I’ve been handed this responsibility where a lot of people get in touch with me across the spectrum, from different sports,” Rafiq said that day. “I know what it was like when I was on my own looking for help and no individual wanted to help me and no organisation wanted to help me. I know how it felt to be completely left on my own and I can’t do that to someone else, as much as it takes a lot out of me every time I speak to someone. “I’m just a normal person from Barnsley and I haven’t really got the tools to help everyone, but it won’t be through lack of trying. One thing I’m not prepared to do is look the other way, because I know how close I came to me taking my own life and in my head I can’t think that someone might get in touch with me and I don’t help them and that takes them over the edge. I feel like I’ve been handed a responsibility from Allah and I’ve just got to fulfil it.” The trip to Poland was the result of just one grain in a sandstorm of unexpected consequences that followed Rafiq’s sudden rise to prominence. In November, while the 31-year-old was speaking to the parliamentary DCMS committee about his experience of racism, the Times published a decade-old text exchange between him and another cricketer, Ateeq Javid, in which he suggested a third player’s reluctance to spend money at a team dinner amounted to behaving like a Jew. He immediately apologised to the Jewish community and promised to “take time to understand and learn and educate myself”. “I don’t want to downplay the messages in any way,” he says now. “They were hurtful, they hurt people, and I got the backlash from that and deservedly so.” The sincerity of his promise to educate himself can be measured in the number of Jewish community organisations whose names now crop up in conversation. Within days he had been taken to a synagogue in London where he met Lily Ebert, a 98-year-old survivor of Auschwitz, and heard for the first time about the Holocaust. Later he was asked to participate in the March of the Living, an annual walk between the original labour camp at Auschwitz and Auschwitz-Birkenau, site of the murder of 1.1 million people between 1942 and 1945, a few kilometres away. This year’s walk took place on Thursday, with 3,000 people taking part, and Rafiq had also spent the preceding couple of days visiting notable sites across Poland with a small group of British multi-faith leaders. The Observer was invited to join them. “I can’t remember ever studying the Holocaust in school,” Rafiq says. “When I started playing cricket academic work wasn’t something I paid that much attention to. I don’t know what stage of school this is taught but I don’t remember it at all. I’d genuinely never heard of it before I met Lily Ebert. I’m embarrassed to say that because everyone kind of goes: ‘Are you sure, mate?’ But I genuinely hadn’t. “But like they say, once you listen to a witness you become a witness. That’s the responsibility of all of us who have come and learned about it to encourage other people to learn about it. “It’s not for everyone to come here, but to learn about Jewish life, Jewish history, what they went through as a community and what they continue to go through, if that doesn’t move you there’s something wrong with you.” The trip was physically and psychologically draining and made still more testing for Rafiq by its timing towards the end of Ramadan. One day, having woken in Warsaw, the group visited Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva, a Jewish seminary opened in 1930 when around 40,000 Jews lived in the city of Lublin – 1,200 are believed to have survived the Holocaust, 650 live there now, and beyond international visitors most current activity seemed to centre around the distribution of food and clothing to Ukrainian refugees – and the nearby Majdanek concentration and extermination camp. We continued to Markowa, a village of a few thousand inhabitants where, in 1944, as punishment for sheltering a group of Jews, a Catholic couple, Jozef and Wiktoria Ulma, and their six children were executed. It now houses an excellent museum dedicated to the Poles who risked or lost their lives attempting to save members of the country’s Jewish community. We continued to the Buczyna forest, just outside the city of Tarnów, where 10,000 people were murdered, mostly by shooting, and buried in mass graves between 1942 and 1943. The day concluded, 600km and 16 hours after it began, at the Jewish Community Centre in Krakow, home of 70,000 Jews in 1939 and a few hundred today, which has also been largely repurposed to distribute aid to Ukrainian refugees. The experience was emotional, provocative and often inspiring, but there was little to raise the spirits. “As difficult and heartbreaking an experience as this has been, I’d encourage anyone to come,” Rafiq says. “I’m absolutely shattered by it, but it’s important to imagine being here as a Jewish person, having family who were killed, seeing the piles of hair. “At Auschwitz they had books with the names of four million known victims and I saw young people looking through them for their family members. I have a lot of respect for them being here at that age and going through all of that.” Walking through sites where the process of murder was perfected and industrialised it can be hard to know how it is appropriate to act and what it is appropriate to feel. “With me fasting I was getting really tired and hungry, but we were walking through places – a wall where people got shot, rooms full of women’s hair –and you’re aware that people went days and days without anything, in pain, and with death right in front of them,” Rafiq says. “It’s so difficult to put in any sort of words, but when you’re there it just hits you and hits you pretty hard. “A lot of it I still can’t quite process on a human level at all. I just can’t get out of my head where everyone else was. We were lucky enough to meet another survivor, Arek Hersh, and listen to his experiences. He was 11 years old when it started and he went through four and a half years of that. Where were people? It’s hard to process and understand at this stage. And we’re here, learning about an atrocity that took place all those years ago, and we’ve bumped into groups of Ukrainian refugees. It just feels like it’s right on our doorstep again and what are we doing?” Throughout his time with March of the Living, Rafiq was treated as something of a celebrity, regularly being pulled away to film a video or pose for a photograph. This was particularly remarkable given that the other participants were overwhelmingly Jewish and he was only there because of his ignorant use of an antisemitic trope. The warmth of his reception was evidence of the sincerity of his response to that story and a reaction to the generosity and humility that is apparent to those who spend time with him, but all this attention was occasionally uncomfortable. “In my ideal world no one would have found out I was here,” he says. “But ultimately I want the cause I’m fighting for to be at the forefront, and for that I’ve got to put myself out there, even if it’s way out of my comfort zone. “I had someone from disability cricket come up to me the other day and just say: ‘I don’t think you realise how much of a difference you’ve made to my life.’ I’ve had parents contact me about the opportunities their kids are getting now. Coaches, administrators. “That means a hell of a lot and it’s something I can look back on with some sort of pride. But I know with these things in the short-term there can be a lot of energy and slowly it sort of wilts away. I’ve been given a platform, and it’s important that I use that platform and make sure that not only cricket but other sports and society as a whole knows these things are not going to be acceptable any more.” In the study of the Holocaust those involved have often been split into three groups: victims, perpetrators and bystanders, those who had seen or heard what was taking place but did nothing to stop it. On an incomparably smaller scale, Rafiq recognises the same classifications in his own experience of prejudice. “In my case it was the bystanders who hurt the most,” he says. “The bystanders were my mates. Bad things happen when good people do nothing and too many bystanders are the reason why things happen that shouldn’t. “In the last couple of days we’ve seen the extreme of discrimination, but let’s not shy away from the fact that these things have happened and they continue to happen. We’ve got to do more than just look after ourselves. There’s no way I can just go: ‘Oh well, my issue’s sorted so everything’s fine.’ I’m not built like that – unfortunately for the system.”",Sport/Sport, Azeem Rafiq at Auschwitz: ‘If this doesn’t move you there’s something wrong’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/01/azeem-rafiq-at-auschwitz-if-this-doesnt-move-you-theres-something-wrong
5/1/2022,"Two years ago today a good witch came very close and looked into the blacks of my eyes and said: “Look around, this is not your first birth. Everything’s different, it’s going to be OK,” then a few minutes later slid a new baby on to my chest and this was how our pandemic began. Everything was different. Lockdown had started the week I went on maternity leave, and I gave birth in a time of PPE shortages and hands cracked from soap, and the prime minister leading the government from his hospital bed. There were no lateral flow tests then. The nurses who so elegantly looked after me were figuring things out as they went along – grappling with latex gloves, their plastic gowns man-sized, too long and too large. Soldiers had converted an exhibition centre in east London into one of the world’s largest hospitals; in Liverpool council bosses were discussing how to “grease the mortality highway” to prevent backlogs in mortuaries. Refrigerated shipping containers were accommodating extra bodies. Outside the hospital, I eyed a blacked-out coach with a livid kind of dread. I’d worked hard, by then, to try to move past the traumatic “first birth” that Deborah, that magical midwife, was talking about – a lot of mental admin and planning to try to avoid similar shocks and glumness, but no amount of planning could have prepared me for this, this weightless fear, this fog of unknowingness. Across the country people were going to scans alone, partners only allowed into the hospital during “established labour”, with all postnatal visits cancelled. The Care Quality Commission found a significant fall in the use of pain relief, a rise in caesareans and fewer women being offered support as they recovered from childbirth. There was a low sort of ringing in the air. Two years later, free testing has ended, my baby can count to 17, and maternity and neonatal services are having to adjust quickly once again. In University College Hospital this January, a woman who was testing negative was kept apart from her baby for days because her husband had Covid – . After the charity Birthrights challenged the hospital it changed its policy on neonatal visiting. Last month, they wrote to three English hospital trusts urging them to also review their visiting restrictions and in March threatened a Welsh maternity service with legal action, arguing they must weigh the evidence of trauma inflicted on families separated at such a significant moment against the need for infection control. Why could partners stay for one hour and not more? Were the risks of two, or six hours so much greater? Another charity, Pregnant Then Screwed, has marked two years since lockdown with a film warning that the rise in postnatal depression will be huge; a mental health epidemic yet to come. People who gave birth during the pandemic shared their experiences, one saying she’d left the hospital with PTSD. As someone who thought a lot about their first birth for many years after, and only now has the distance to judge my flimsy mental health in the time that followed, I can feel that threat keenly. We’re yet to see exactly what this mental health epidemic might look like, what it will do to families born out of those sanitised months, rich in banana bread, low in comfort. So, “The legacy of this pandemic,” says Maria Booker of Birthrights, “must be maternity services that are shaped around protecting mental health as well as physical health.” She’s concerned whether hospital trusts have learned the lessons about taking the widest view of safety and incorporating human rights into their decision making, regardless of whether a pandemic is raging. The crushing thing, I realise now, about giving birth in lockdown, was that many of the common and regular anxieties about having a baby were realised even before we’d left the house. What if something goes wrong? It already has! What if I can’t do this by myself? Good luck! What if, in the long days that follow, I’m excruciatingly lonely? You will be! Nobody’s dropping round, nobody’s coming to hold your baby while you shower off the dried blood, no professionals will be popping in to quantify your sadness. I mean, there were lovely things, for me, about having a baby in 2020, but I think largely it’s been a shitshow, with women in the UK (as reported by the Maternal Mental Health Alliance) experiencing a combination of lockdown, job insecurity, the impact of the virus itself, and a reduced ability to gain access to perinatal health services and mental health services. Though this morning my two-year-old was more interested in breakfast cake, which is a thing now, I found myself telling him the story of his birth. The endless early lockdown deliberations about whether it was safe for my mum to drive us to hospital, about who was allowed to look after our daughter while we were gone, the empty streets, the newness of face masks, and how everything was different. And how for the first time in a month, that idea – that everything was different – was suddenly and briefly, amazing.

5/1/2022,"Claims that a new coalmine in Cumbria will help supply British-made steel and replace Russian imports do not “stack up”, a senior industry figure has warned, as the government prepares to make a final decision over the project. Supporters of the proposed mine, which would be the UK’s first new coalmine in 30 years, have suggested that at least a share of the coal produced would be used in domestic steel production. They also say it could lower reliance on Russian coking coal in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. However, influential figures in the steel industry have become increasingly frustrated about the claims – with the two domestic steel producers understood to be unlikely to be significant customers for the mine’s coal. Chris McDonald, chief executive of the Materials Processing Institute, which serves as the UK’s national centre for steel research, said there was no demand from his industry for the West Cumbria mine. “There’s a frustration hearing other industries speaking on behalf of the steel industry when the steel industry itself has not come out to say that it wants this mine,” he told the Observer. “I would contend that there isn’t a demand for it. The case for the mine has been built around the need for coking coal produced in the UK for the UK steel industry. That’s the case that the coal industry is making. But that doesn’t stack up with the needs of the steel industry. “There are only two potential customers for this coal in the UK: Tata Steel and British Steel. British Steel have said they cannot use the coal from this mine because the sulphur levels are too high. Tata Steel have said if the coal were available, then they may or may not use a small amount. There isn’t anyone in the steel industry who’s calling for the mine.” The Woodhouse Colliery was initially approved by councillors in 2020. However, ministers intervened and launched an inquiry following opposition to the project, which grew in the run-up to the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow last year. Michael Gove is set to decide on whether to approve the mine by July. Recent reports have suggested he is minded to do so, although his department states no decision has been made. West Cumbria Mining (WCM) has said the plan would create 530 permanent jobs, with 80% going to local people. McDonald, who also chairs the UK Metals Council, questioned claims that the mine would lower reliance on Russian energy imports. Mike Starkie, the Conservative mayor of Copeland, which includes the proposed Whitehaven location of the mine, said the Ukraine invasion had “demonstrated why we need far more self-reliance for all of our natural resources”. Local MP Trudy Harrison said the UK has “typically” imported coking coal from Russia. McDonald dismissed the claim. “I think it’s important to be clear that even if this mine opened tomorrow, it would not displace a single tonne of Russian coking coal from the UK – and I can say that with confidence,” he said. “Tata Steel already does not use any Russian coking coal. British Steel have said they can’t use the coal from Cumbria. So there’s no possibility that it can displace any Russian imports. “We’ve got all of the big players in the European steel industry, with plans to gradually reduce their reliance on coking coal from 2030 onwards. If the mine were given approval tomorrow, I think it wouldn’t open until 2026 or similar. So it’s unlikely to have a very long life in that regard. There might be some other basis or some other case that somebody is making for the mine. From my view, as someone who’s worked in the steel industry for 20 years and deals a lot in future steel technology, there isn’t a demand from the steel industry for the mine. Environmental arguments aside, I think they’ve missed the boat on the market, essentially.” Sources at Tata Steel concurred with McDonald’s view, though the company has not publicly expressed a view on the mine. British Steel declined to comment.

5/1/2022,"The last time I saw Anthony Albanese on the main stage of a Labor launch was in the dying days of the Rudd government when he was the deputy prime minister. That funereal outing in 2013 mourned the lost opportunity of a government completely destroyed by the insanity of the Rudd/Gillard civil war, the aggressive hyper partisanship of Tony Abbott, and powerful institutional forces that wanted to see the back of the most progressive Labor government since Whitlam. Back then, in 2013, Albanese was staring defeat in the face and struggling to contain his emotions. On Sunday, in Perth, Albanese brimmed with emotion as well, but now he was the Labor leader, daring to hope. Labor is daring to hope that Scott Morrison can be beaten. Labor doesn’t know whether the PM can be toppled because the buffer the Coalition created for itself back in 2019 might save him. At the federal level, Labor is more used to losing than winning. People are worried Albanese could serve up a fatal error in the closing days of the campaign that dashes the 2022 dream. That threat is present. But as the campaign enters the final stretch Labor is daring to hope. Albanese presented to voters on Sunday as a political leader who wasn’t born thinking he was owed the prime ministership. He’s not a powerful orator; he lacks the velvety intonation and the X factor. He didn’t seek to dominate the room; he sought connections in it, looking for faces, reactions, cues. He was modelling a different style of leadership – a style not that familiar to Australians after a succession of power players in Canberra. Albanese doesn’t exhibit any of the hallmarks of toxic masculinity. Rather than a set jaw, there’s an incline of the head, a gesture of listening – a physical glance at humility. Albanese’s pitch to voters on Sunday was twofold. You’ve had enough of Morrison. You’ve figured him out. If you stick with him and his endless politicking and pork barrelling, Australia will be clubbed by the future, and you know it. Vote for Morrison and you’ll be stuck with stretched government services the Coalition won’t commit to fixing. You’ll be stuck with the climate wars that never end, and you’ll be stuck with your flat wages and your rising prices and an economy that doesn’t work for you. That was pitch one: you know Morrison is out of tricks, out of time and out of luck, so it’s time to vote him out. This election is a choice “between shaping the future or being shaped by it”. Pitch two was about the role of government. On that score, Albanese argues Labor knows how to plan, Labor knows how to build the policy architecture of the future, Labor knows about the caring and essential services economy that kept us alive over the past couple of years, and cares enough to make it stronger. Labor cares enough to take an equity stake in a house you can’t afford to buy to give you a shot of moving past renting. Labor cares enough about women to give them a shot at pay equity. Government, in this pitch, is presented as a partnership with people. Labor thinks Australians after three years of natural disasters and a pandemic are open to the idea of government being present for people. Morrison thinks that’s a miscalculation, a misread of the mood, and what Australia is up for is for governments to move back and let people write their own destinies. One of these judgments will be correct. We’ll find out in three weeks.",News/Australia news,Anthony Albanese presents as a leader who wasn’t born thinking he was owed the prime ministership | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/01/anthony-albanese-presents-as-a-leader-who-wasnt-born-thinking-he-was-owed-the-prime-ministership
5/1/2022,"Joe Biden celebrated the return of a flashy annual gathering of Washington’s political and media elites on Saturday with some humorous jabs at Donald Trump – and himself. The US president, sporting a tuxedo and slightly askew bow tie, spoke at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, which was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. It was another tentative step towards Washington norms after Trump repeatedly snubbed the gala, which champions the freedom of the press. “This is the first time the president has attended this dinner in six years,” Biden observed. “It’s understandable. We had a horrible plague – followed by two years of Covid.” That quip produced laughter. The next one elicited both laughter and groans: “Just imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year. Now that would really have been a real coup if that occurred.” The gathering included the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and other cabinet members as well as journalists such as CNN’s Jake Tapper and MSNBC’s Joy Reid. Celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Pete Davidson, Brooke Shields and Caitlyn Jenner walked the red carpet. The three-course dinner took place in a vast, crowded hotel ballroom despite the long shadow cast by the pandemic. Biden, 79, skipped the meal with the 2,600 guests, all of whom had to provide proof of vaccination and a same-day negative test. The event was an opportunity for the president – or more precisely his speechwriters – to flex some comedy muscles at the expense of the media, the Republican party and his own ego. He began: “A special thanks to the 42% of you who actually applauded. I’m really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans with a lower approval rating than I have.” The president made fun of the hypocrisy of conservative cable channel Fox News, which has required its own employees to be vaccinated or tested daily, even as its primetime hosts rail against Biden’s vaccine mandates. “I know there are questions about whether we should gather here tonight, because of Covid. Well, we’re here to show the country that we’re getting through this pandemic. Plus, everyone had to prove they’re fully vaccinated and boosted. So if you’re home watching this, and you’re wondering how to do that, just contact your favourite Fox News reporter. They’re all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them.” He also seized on recent revelations that Trump’s White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Fox News’s Sean Hannity exchanged more than 80 text messages between election day in 2020 and Biden’s inauguration. “Fox News, I’m really sorry your preferred candidate lost the last election. To make it up to you, I’m happy to give my chief of staff to you all so he can tell Sean Hannity what to say every day.” Perhaps the biggest laugh came when Biden made light of the “Let’s Go Brandon” slogan, which has become rightwing code for swearing at him. “Republicans seem to support one fella, some guy named Brandon. He’s having a really good year and I’m kind of happy for him.” When Biden shifted gear towards the end of his 14-minute speech to recognise the importance of journalism to American democracy, he again drew a contrast with his predecessor by insisting that a free press “is not the enemy of the people”. “Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what’s clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you – the free press – matter more than you ever did in the last century,” Biden said. He added that “American democracy is not a reality show” – seemingly another dig at Trump, former host of The Apprentice. In another restoration of tradition, the president was obliged to sit as he was roasted by a comedian. South African Trevor Noah, host of Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, told Biden: “Thank you for having me here. And I was a little confused on why me, but then I was told that you get your highest approval ratings when a biracial African guy is standing next to you.” Noah also observed: “Ever since you came into office, things are already looking up. Gas is up, rent is up, food is up, everything.” The comedian took swipes at media personalities and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis. He said of Kyrsten Sinema, a conservative Democratic senator who has helped to thwart much of Biden’s legislative agenda: “Who ever thought we’d see the day when a senator could be openly bisexual but a closeted Republican?” Noah wrapped up with a reference to Biden’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, telling the audience: “Please be careful leaving tonight. We all know this administration doesn’t handle evacuations well.” The black tie dinner had other serious moments, with tributes to pioneer journalists of colour and aspiring student reporters. A sombre photo montage honouring journalists killed while covering the Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted a standing ovation. Chris Coons, a Democratic senator and Biden ally, told the Guardian: “As it has always been in its best years in the past, this was an evening that was celebrating young journalists, celebrating seasoned journalists, celebrating pathbreaking journalists from a generation ago and mixed with a lot of humour, some hobnobbing, some celebrities. “The president played exactly the role we would hope a president would: a little bit of light humour, a very serious tribute to the importance of a free press and then sitting and listening as others poked fun at him.”",News/US news,"‘A horrible plague, then Covid’: Biden and correspondents joke in post-Trump return to normality",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/01/a-horrible-plague-then-covid-biden-and-correspondents-joke-in-post-trump-return-to-normality
5/1/2022,"Looking back on his young self, all that irrepressible boyish power, Boris Becker once observed: “When you are a teenager, you are looking for your own identity, and winning is a way of expressing yourself. And because I thought in victory I became somebody, in defeat, it followed I was nobody.” No doubt, as Becker negotiates his first weekend of a two-and-a-half year jail sentence in Wandsworth prison – just a couple of miles from his Wimbledon triumphs – he will have cause, at 54, to examine the true nature of those extremes. The highest level of sporting stardom is the closest contemporary life gets to Greek myth and fatal flaws never make easy viewing. In passing judgment on the former champion on Friday – Becker was convicted of deliberately hiding several million pounds of assets from a bankruptcy court in 2017 – the judge, Deborah Taylor, told him: “You have not shown remorse… and have sought to distance yourself from your offending and your bankruptcy. While I accept your humiliation as part of the proceedings, there has been no humility.” If she had ever seen him play, she would have known that emotion was always the hardest thing for Becker to express. It was also what made him so precociously indomitable. There was no need for any feints or mind games in his early career. His tennis mentor, the Romanian Ion Tiriac, recalled how in “those early years – ’85, ’86, ’87 – Becker was the most natural, crystal-clear youngster I ever saw. He didn’t know how to lie, didn’t need to lie, didn’t need to find excuses or hype… That’s what made human beings around the world identify with him.” The memory of that honesty on a tennis court was also the thing that made his dissembling in Southwark crown court so tough to contemplate. He stood in the dock in his green and purple All England Club tie, as if it might still hold some magic to protect him from the more brutal realities of the world. It is a cliche that sportsmen – and tennis is arguably the most mentally fraught of all sports – need the discipline of the game to hold their demons in check. Becker, with his internalised demands of perfectionism that he was determined to take to a new level, was always likely to be exhibit A of that truism. What the judge described as his “fall from grace” began too neatly even for scriptwriters with a passion for clear story arcs. On the evening of Becker’s final defeat at Wimbledon, after “drinking too much with his buddies”, he found himself in a broom cupboard of Nobu restaurant with the Russian-Algerian model Angela Ermakova. It was “not an affair”, it was “poom-pah-boom!” he later recalled. The resultant paternity suit and divorce proceedings from his first wife, Barbara, and his habits of denial, began the emptying of Becker’s finances that 23 years on have resulted in his jail term. Of course, those facts prove that Becker has no one to blame for his predicament but himself. His sentence also sends a welcome message that no one is above the law. But still, anyone with half a heart who thrilled to the German’s unforgettable Centre Court triumphs can feel no schadenfreude at his horrible reversal in fortune, only sadness.

5/1/2022,"He was the king of reggae, a giant of Jamaican music whose life was cut short in 1981, aged just 36. Now Bob Marley is to be celebrated on the big screen with a film that will be shot in London and Jamaica this autumn. Kingsley Ben-Adir, a rising star of British film and theatre, whose previous roles include Malcolm X in One Night in Miami, will play Marley in the Paramount movie. The director who cast him is Reinaldo Marcus Green, after the success of his studio directorial debut, King Richard, in which Will Smith played Richard Williams, who coached his daughters Venus and Serena into becoming tennis superstars. It received six Oscar nominations, including best picture, with a best actor win for Smith. Green told the Observer that, in casting Marley, he chose an actor rather than a musician: “I was more interested in his acting. The same way that I approached King Richard, the two young actresses that play Venus and Serena [Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton] had no sports capabilities whatsoever. It’s about being great actors – and then training.” Ben-Adir, among the nominees for the rising star award in the 2021 Baftas, also played Colonel Ben Younger in the BBC’s Peaky Blinders. Green said: “I was blown away by his audition tape. It was exquisite. I went back to look at his other work and realised how strong a performer he is.” Marley, born to a black mother and a white father, rose from poverty, beginning his singing career in the 1960s with the vocal group the Wailers and going on to become one of the bestselling artists of all time. Poverty and oppression, along with dignity and hope, were among the themes of enduring hits, including Get Up, Stand Up; No Woman, No Cry; and Could You Be Loved. His spiritual beliefs in the Jamaican religious movement Rastafari inspired him in standing up for the poor and dispossessed. Green said that Ben-Adir is also mixed race, among shared “fundamental characteristics which are so important in the casting”: “Then it’s about performance and ideas. He’s never going to be able to play like Bob in the time that he has to prepare for the role. But he can immerse himself in the world of Bob and folks around him, understanding everything from how to hold the guitar to what it’s like being a musician. “Right now we don’t know how much Kingsley will actually sing. There might be a combination of real voice and the real tracks. You can’t mimic Bob Marley. You have to have an essence of who he was.” He added that, as well as reading books on Marley and watching and listening to his performances, he will “let his fingers bleed while trying to learn how to play the guitar and take method to a whole new level”. Green – born the year Marley died – won the special jury award for outstanding first feature at the 2018 Sundance film festival for his film Monsters and Men, an acclaimed tough drama about young African-American men. He said that the box-office success of Bohemian Rhapsody – which won Rami Malek an Oscar for his portrayal of the Queen singer Freddie Mercury – has made film-makers realise the huge public appetite for films about musicians: “Leonard Bernstein is being created this year. Also, Elvis Presley, Madonna and Martin Scorsese’s Grateful Dead biopic … There’s an explosion of musical biopics. Bohemian set the bar in terms of reach.” Green has written the script with Zach Baylin, who got an Oscar nomination for his King Richard screenplay. He is also collaborating with Marley’s children, including his sons Ziggy and Stephen and daughter Cedella, as well as those closest to him: “Now that Zach and I feel the script is really singing, we can sit down with the family and Bob’s inner circle to fill in any blanks. We really want to get the notes right.” He spoke of the family’s concern that Marley is portrayed “in a way that feels authentic and meaningful”: “We talk all the time. Every step of the way, the script, the casting, the hair, the makeup.” Rather than making a biopic that traces an entire life, the film will instead focus on the 1970s, when Marley survived an assassination attempt in Jamaica and fled to London, where he recorded his album Exodus, with hits that included Jamming, Three Little Birds and One Love. Although it will celebrate his life, it will portray a man who was “flawed and complex”, with “so many contradictions”, Green said: “He gave a lot of joy and spread messages of love and peace which are as important as ever today. But we want to show every side of Bob, including his toughness, without sugar-coating anything.” He added: “I want this to be for people who know and love Bob, and who can still find out things about his life that they didn’t know, as well as introducing him to a new generation.”",Arts/Music,Director of new Bob Marley movie casts actor with no musical training,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/01/reinaldo-marcus-green-new-bob-marley-movie-casts-actor-with-no-musical-training
5/1/2022,"Acampaign has been launched to recognize American queer artist Edward Gorey, whose “sinister whimsy” drawings inspired everyone from the novelist Lemony Snicket to film director Tim Burton, with a US postage stamp on his 100th birthday in 2025. “Eccentric” isn’t strong enough to describe the writer, illustrator, puppeteer and theatre designer known to some as the “Grandfather of Goth”. The late ballet fanatic stalked 1960s and 70s New York in ripped jeans, raccoon fur coat, costume jewelry and an Edwardian beard, and kept a mummified head stored in a closet. He illustrated hundreds of books for authors like Samuel Beckett, TS Eliot and HG Wells as well as an emerging Andy Warhol, and won two Tony awards for his 1977 Broadway revival of Dracula. Gorey created more than 100 tiny books filled with morbid, camp, Victorian-style crosshatch etchings, including The Glorious Nosebleed, The Fatal Lozenge and The Gashlycrumb Tinies, which dispatched children in rhyming couplets (beginning “A is for Amy who fell down the stairs” and ending “Z is for Zillah who drank too much gin”). He died surrounded by 25,000 books, leaving his fortune to animal charities in honour of his six cats. “Goreyphiles” include film-makers Wes Anderson and Monty Python, fashion designer Anna Sui, Snicket creator Daniel Handler and Coraline author Neil Gaiman. His most obvious “fan”, Burton, remains mute, although the set designer for The Corpse Bride and Nightmare Before Christmas reportedly confirmed the influence. Yet, he’s not a household name. “He’s that oxymoron: a mainstream cult,” said Mark Dery, author of a Gorey biography, Born to Be Posthumous. “The people making culture are influenced by Gorey but … the ordinary folks who dine on a steady diet of Hollywood blockbusters and Marvel franchises might not be aware that they know Gorey without knowing him.” The Edward Gorey House, a museum opened in his 200-year-old house in Yarmouth Port, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, after he died in 2000 aged 75, hopes to change that. Last month they organised a letter-writing campaign to the US Postal Service, with Gorey now reaching “committee stage” for consideration as a celebrity stamp. Past examples include author James Baldwin, astronaut Sally Ride, and this year, the Native and African American sculptor Edmonia Lewis. Why has recognition taken so long? Dery said: “To my mind, what made him inimitable to becoming a mass phenomenon … and taking his place in the pantheon of US culture … is his profound queerness.” Gorey famously rejected classification: a gothic writer who wasn’t goth, a children’s author who didn’t write for children, a graphic novel genre founder who insisted he wrote “Victorian novels all scrunched up”. Whether he identified as LGBT+ is a fierce debate between those who consider him a workaholic more interested in cats, and others, like Fun Home author Alison Bechdel, who revere his work’s iconic queerness, regardless of his personal preference. In 1980 Gorey told Boston magazine “I suppose I’m gay”, but said that he didn’t like the label, was “undersexed” and “a person before I am anything else.” (Ironically, this led to him being labelled as asexual or non-binary.) “He was a man of mystery,” said Kevin Shortsleeve, associate professor of children’s literature at Christopher Newport University, Virginia, who considers Gorey on a par with Maurice Sendak, a contemporary Goreyphile who wrote the world-famous Where the Wild Things Are. “He left ambiguity, unfinished endings, essentially ‘white space’, in his work and life … letting people read between the lines and fill in themselves.” Born in Chicago in 1925, the hardcore anglophile drew on 19th century, acid-tongued, LGBT+ British satirists and “literary nonsense” writers including Oscar Wilde, Lewis Carroll, Edward Lear, cautionary tales, Penny Dreadful comics and woodcut drawings. He graduated from Harvard in 1950, allegedly a member of its “gay underground” along with his roommate, the poet Frank O’Hara, during the rise of McCarthyism when LGBT+ communities were considered the “lavender menace”. Prof Shortsleeve credits the lack of mainstream success partly to that “conservative, pre-Stonewall era”, with “sanitised” literature and LGBT+ figures living “flamboyant”, coded lives hidden in plain sight. The Curious Sofa didn’t help. Billed on the cover as “pornographic’” yet containing no nudity, with “action” taking place in furtive glances and innuendo, the 1961 book was eagerly stocked by children’s bookstores wanting to repeat the success of Wuggly Ump – but was quickly removed. “People were afraid of him,” said Shortsleeve. “His transgressive work marks a huge leap in nonsense, modernist and postmodernist literature that went unrecognised. When I ask 30 students who he is, one person raises their hand. For those who know, his impact is incalculable.” A fanbase he may have embraced is the death positive movement. In 2018 The Death Salon hosted a Gorey party in Mount Auburn cemetery, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, featuring funeral directors and a “haute macabre” dress code. The $225 tickets sold out in 24 hours. Megan Rosenbloom, Death Salon’s director, hailed Gorey’s gallows humour in the face of “western death denial”, adding: “I get the same fuzzy feeling from Gorey as others do from Winnie the Pooh.” According to legend, Gorey quit New York for the Cape “in protest” when ballet director George Balanchine, whose performances he never missed, died in 1983. Though he didn’t immediately occupy the derelict house he bought, to avoid displacing the raccoons until they were “ready.” His increasing interest in animal welfare led him to sell his fur coats, which still appear at auctions. New York Studio School art historian Karen Wilkin, who befriended him as a ballet student, recalls rooms “verging on hoarding … suffering from fleas”, with Gorey “a cultural encyclopedia” obsessively watching Japanese silent films or Buffy the Vampire Slayer, while sewing puppets now fetching thousands. “I can hear his sighs,” she said of the stamp campaign, “like: ‘Why are they doing this?’. Secretly, he would have liked it.” One man who would buy many stamps is Ken Morton, son of Gorey’s cousin Skee, immortalised in The Deranged Cousins (Sotheby’s is selling a first edition for $1,100), and the only child whose relationship with Gorey didn’t involve murder by ink. “I had no idea of his … fame when I was growing up”, said Morton, who remembers “Uncle Ted” in jean shorts doing jigsaws. “It was after his death that I learned just how big a deal he was, globally. He may actually be incomparable.” At Gorey’s house, between “dead” puppets flung under carpets purged of fleas (“G is for Gregory smothered under a rug”), a quote on the wall says: “Life is intrinsically, well, boring and dangerous at the same time. At any given moment the floor may open up. Of course, it almost ever does; that’s what makes it so boring.”",Arts/Art and design,‘Grandfather of Goth’: fans campaign for US stamp honoring Edward Gorey,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/01/edward-gorey-stamp-campaign-grandfather-of-goth
5/1/2022,"The TV doctor Mehmet Oz’s move into politics appears to have been a step too far for administrators at Columbia University, who have quietly purged his presence from their website as the Republican seeks to represent Pennsylvania in the US Senate. For more than seven years, the private New York university has resisted calls to cut ties with Oz, a heart surgeon who has used his TV platform to push medicines ranging from ineffective diet pills to discredited Covid treatments. According to the Daily Beast, that changed this year, within weeks of Oz, 61, declaring his candidacy for the Senate seat being vacated by the Republican Pat Toomey. Oz, a friend and acolyte to Donald Trump, who has endorsed him, no longer has personal pages on the website of Columbia’s Irving Medical Center, the Beast reported, noting he once held senior titles including director of surgery and director of integrated medicine. Columbia did not respond to an inquiry from the Guardian. The Beast suggested the decision was political. Faculty leaders stuck with Oz through numerous medical controversies, including his 2014 Senate testimony regarding his plugging of “sham” diet pills on The Dr Oz Show, which ended its 13-season run this year. Following the testimony, a group of distinguished physicians wrote to Columbia, claiming Oz had “repeatedly shown disdain for science and for evidence-based medicine” and shown “outrageous conflicts of interest or flawed judgements about what constitutes appropriate medical treatments, or both”. “Worst of all,” the letter continued, “he has manifested an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain.” One of the signatories to the letter, which Columbia rebuffed, was Scott Atlas, who would himself be criticized for spreading misinformation as coronavirus adviser to the Trump administration. In 2011, the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) branded as “misleading and irresponsible” a report on the Dr Oz Show suggesting apple juice contained dangerously high levels of arsenic. The prominent medical ethicist Dr Arthur Caplan, who in 2014 accused Oz of “promoting fairy dust”, told the Guardian he was not surprised Columbia had “quietly eliminated” Oz. “They won’t have a press conference in the middle of this guy running for the Senate saying they were throwing him out … it could be seen as trying to influence an election, it could be risking bad blood should he become a senator,” said Caplan, professor and founding head of the Grossman School of Medicine Division of Medical Ethics at New York University. “My question becomes, ‘What took so long?’ He’s been a huge danger to public health in the US and around the world for a long time with respect to quack cures for Covid and touting quackery to treat diseases. “I was among the voices saying he had to be removed years ago. And I still think it’s the right thing to do because he really has forfeited credibility as a doctor. Whether that will matter in terms of the election, we shall see. “I think it should, I doubt it will.” The Oz campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Polling for the Pennsylvania Republican Senate primary on 17 May shows Oz trailing David McCormick, a hedge fund manager, by between 2% and 11%, according to Real Clear Politics. Many analysts see the race as a test of Trump’s grip on the Republican party. At a rally in Selma, North Carolina, earlier this month, the former president called Oz a “great guy, good man … Harvard-educated, tremendous, tremendous career and they liked him for a long time. “That’s like a poll. You know, when you’re in television for 18 years, that’s like a poll, that means people like you.” Trump and Oz will appear at a rally in Greensburg, Pennsylvania on 6 May. Trump previously endorsed Sean Parnell, who withdrew after being accused by his wife of abusive behavior, which he denied.",News/US news,Dr Oz dropped by Columbia amid pro-Trump Republican Senate run – report,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/01/dr-oz-dropped-by-columbia-amid-pro-trump-republican-senate-run-report
5/1/2022,"This Will Not Pass is a blockbuster. Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns deliver 473 pages of essential reading. The two New York Times reporters depict an enraged Republican party, besotted by and beholden to Donald Trump. They portray a Democratic party led by Joe Biden as, in equal measure, inept and out of touch. Martin and Burns make their case with breezy prose, interviews and plenty of receipts. After Kevin McCarthy denied having talked smack about Trump and the January 6 insurrection, Martin appeared on MSNBC with tapes to show the House Republican leader lied. In Burns and Martin’s pages, Trump attributes McCarthy’s cravenness to an “inferiority complex”. The would-be speaker’s spinelessness and obsequiousness are recurring themes, along with the Democrats’ political vertigo. On election day 2020, the country simply sought to restore a modicum of normalcy. Nothing else. Even as Biden racked up a 7m-vote plurality, Republicans gained 16 House seats. There was no mandate. Think checks, balances and plenty of fear. Biden owes his job to suburban moms and dads, not the woke. As the liberal Brookings Institution put it in a post-election report, “Biden’s victory came from the suburbs”. Said differently, the label of socialism, the reality of rising crime, a clamor for open borders and demands for defunding the police almost cost Democrats the presidency. As a senator, Biden knew culture mattered. Whether his party has internalized any lessons, though, is doubtful. On election day 2021, the party lost the Virginia governor’s mansion. Republican attacks over critical race theory and Covid-driven school closures and Democrats’ wariness over parental involvement in education did them in. This year, the midterms offer few encouraging signs. This Will Not Pass portrays Biden as dedicated to his belief his presidency ought to be transformational. In competition with the legacy of Barack Obama, he yearns for comparison to FDR. “I am confident that Barack is not happy with the coverage of this administration as more transformative than his,” Biden reportedly told one adviser. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, is more blunt: “Obama is jealous of Biden.” Then again, Hunter Biden is not the Obamas’ son. Michelle and Barack can’t be too jealous. A telephone conversation between Biden and Abigail Spanberger, a moderate congresswoman from Virginia, captures the president’s self-perception. “This is President Roosevelt,” he begins, following up by thanking Spanberger for her sense of humor. She replies: “I’m glad you have a sense of humor, Mr President.” Spanberger represents a swing district, is a former member of the intelligence community and was a driving force in both Trump impeachments. This Will Not Pass also amplifies the disdain senior Democrats hold for the “Squad”, those members of the Democratic left wing who cluster round Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Martin and Burns quote Steve Ricchetti, a Biden counselor: “The problem with the left … is that they don’t understand that they lost.” Cedric Richmond, a senior Biden adviser and former dean of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), is less diplomatic. He describes the squad as “fucking idiots”. Richmond also takes exception to AOC pushing back at the vice-president, Kamala Harris, for telling undocumented migrants “do not come.” “AOC’s hit on Kamala was despicable,” Richmond says. “What it did for me is show a clear misunderstanding of what’s going on in the world.” Meanwhile, Cori Bush, a Squad member, has picked a fight with the CBC and led the charge against domestic terror legislation. Burns and Martin deliver vivid portraits of DC suck-ups and screw-ups. They capture Lindsey Graham, the oleaginous senior senator from South Carolina, in all his self-abasing glory. During the authors’ interview with Trump, Graham called the former president. After initially declining to pick up, Trump answered. “Hello, Lindsey.” He then placed Graham on speaker, without letting him know reporters were seated nearby. Groveling began instantly. Graham praised the power of Trump’s endorsements and the potency of his golf game. Stormy Daniels would not have been impressed. The senator, Burns and Martin write, sounded like “nothing more than an actor in a diet-fad commercial who tells his credulous viewer that he had been skeptical of the glorious product – until he tried it”. This Will Not Pass also attempts to do justice to Kyrsten Sinema, the Arizona senator and “former Green party activist who reinvented herself as Fortune 500-loving moderate”. In addition to helping block Biden’s domestic agenda, Sinema has a knack for performative behavior and close ties to Republicans. Like Sarah Palin, she is fond of her own physique. The senator “boasted knowingly to colleagues and aides that her cleavage had an extraordinary persuasive effect on the uptight men of the GOP”. Palin is running to represent Alaska in Congress. Truly, we are blessed. Subtitled Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America’s Future, Burns and Martin’s book closes with a meditation on the state of US democracy. The authors are anxious. Trump has not left the stage. Republican leadership has bent the knee. Mitch McConnell wants to be Senate majority leader again. He knows what the base is thinking and saying. Marjorie Taylor Greene is far from a one-person minority. Martin and Burns quote Malcolm Turnbull, a former prime minister of Australia: “You know that great line that you hear all the time: ‘This is not us. This is not America.’ You know what? It is, actually.” The Republicans are ahead on the generic ballot, poised to regain House and Senate. Biden’s favorability is under water. Pitted against Trump, he struggles to stay even. His handling of Russia’s war on Ukraine has not moved the needle. Inflation dominates the concerns of most Americans. For the first time in two years, the economy contracts. It is a long time to November 2024. Things can always get worse.
