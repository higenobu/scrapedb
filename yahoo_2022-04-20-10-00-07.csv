4/20/2022,"MBS erupted at US national security advisor Jake Sullivan when the two men met for the first time last year, WSJ reported. The crown prince started ""shouting"" at Sullivan after he brought up Jamal Khashoggi's brutal murder. Khashoggi was assassinated in 2018, and the CIA later concluded that MBS personally ordered his killing. Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman erupted at national security advisor Jake Sullivan during a meeting last year when Sullivan brought up the assassination of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. That's according to The Wall Street Journal, which reported that the argument happened last September, when the two men met for the first time since President Joe Biden took office. Although the crown prince wanted to strike a ""relaxed tone"" for their meeting, he ""ended up shouting at Mr. Sullivan after he raised the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi,"" the newspaper reported. ""The prince told Mr. Sullivan he never wanted to discuss the matter again,"" people familiar with the discussion told The Journal. The crown prince also said that the US ""could forget about its request to boost oil production."" Khashoggi, 59, a longtime Washington Post columnist known for his criticism of the Saudi kingdom, was assassinated and dismembered at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018, after going there to get paperwork for his upcoming marriage. The CIA concluded a little over a month later that Prince Mohammed, also known as MBS, had personally ordered Khashoggi's murder. The Journal's report on Tuesday detailed at length the deterioration of the US's relationship with Saudi Arabia over the last several years. Those divisions have deepened since Russia launched a full-scale, unprovoked invasion in Ukraine in February. The US and other Western nations have pushed the kingdom to increase its production of crude oil to offset rising oil prices and squeeze Russia's ability to finance its war. But, The Journal reported, Saudi Arabia has refused to do so thus far and its interests remain aligned with Russia's. This story is breaking. Check back for updates.

4/20/2022,"A court in Japan posthumously returned 45 cents to a train driver after deducting the money from his payroll because he caused a one-minute delay in 2020.

The Okayama District Court ordered the West Japan Railway Co. on Tuesday to pay the train driver, who demanded 2.2 million yen (approximately $17,065) compensation for emotional distress in March 2021.

The train driver, who was in his 50s, died from an illness earlier this year.

In June 2020, the train driver reportedly waited for an empty train at the wrong platform, causing a two-minute delay. West Japan Railway Co. then deducted 85 yen (approximately 66 cents) from the driver’s payroll. However, the company reduced it to a one-minute delay after the Okayama labor standards inspection office became involved and deducted 45 cents instead.

The train driver then attempted to sue West Japan Railway Co. in March 2021, but was unsuccessful.

Judge Hisanori Okuno ruled on Tuesday that the train driver would be posthumously compensated after concluding that the man immediately recognized and corrected his mistake. Okuno stated if an employee spends their work hours correcting a mistake related to a task, they must still be paid for services rendered.

In March, West Japan Railway Co. revised their policy in which any mistakes caused by a train delay would constitute a pay deduction and count as time not worked. The company added that they were planning the revision before the lawsuit occurred and “sincerely accepts the ruling.” Enjoy this content? Read more from NextShark!

4/20/2022,"The Army has found its replacements for the M4 rifle and M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, handing out a contract to put new guns in the hands of tens of thousands of soldiers. The force is awarding a 10-year, $20.4 million contract to Sig Sauer for the XM5 Rifle, which will become the new standard rifle for soldiers, and the XM250 Automatic Rifle, which will replace the SAW. The service will also switch from 5.56mm ammo to 6.8mm, after a search for rounds better built to penetrate body armor. Read Next: Land Navigation Is Coming Back to the Army's Basic Leader Course ""Both weapons fire common 6.8 millimeter ammunition utilizing government provided projectiles and vendor-designed cartridges,"" an Army spokesperson said in a press release. ""The new ammunition includes multiple types of tactical and training rounds that increase accuracy and are more lethal against emerging threats than both the 5.56mm and 7.62mm ammunition."" The news comes after a 27-month evaluation process in which other defense contractors, including General Dynamics, competed to be the Army's go-to small arms dealer. The weapons will include the XM157 Fire Control optic, which includes a laser range finder, ballistic calculator, visible and infrared lasers, and a compass. That optic is made by Vortex Optics. It's unclear how many weapons the Army aims to buy over the decade, or how quickly soldiers will totally ditch the decades-old SAW and rifle. In its proposed 2023 budget, the force is requesting 29,046 new weapons. But that budget still needs to be approved by Congress. -- Steve Beynon can be reached at Steve.Beynon@military.com.

4/20/2022,"A Trump-appointed Federal judge in Florida has voided a national mask mandate for airplanes and other transportation. “Wearing a mask cleans nothing,” U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle wrote in her decision on Monday. “At most, it traps virus droplets. But it neither ‘sanitizes’ the person wearing the mask nor ‘sanitizes’ the conveyance.” Mizelle, 35, was only eight years out of law school at University of Florida when Trump appointed her to the lifetime position in 2020. The Daily Beast noted at the time that her only trial experience was as an intern, and that she held four clerkships, including one for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Mizelle was rated “not qualified” by the American Bar Association prior to her appointment, citing her lack of experience.

Thanks, Travis Tritt, for Accidentally Saving Lives With Your Dumb Covid Policy 'They Can't Stop Everyone': GOP Congressman Dangerously Encourages Kids to Defy Statewide School Mask Mandate The transportation mandate case on which Mizelle ruled was filed on behalf of a group known as Health Freedom Defense Fund, as well as airline passengers. Mizelle said that the Centers for Disease Control had exceeded its legal authority, that it had failed to justify its decision and follow comment protocols, and that the mandate was “arbitrary and capricious,” according to The Washington Post. The CDC had announced earlier this month that it extended its mask mandate to May 3. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said it will no longer enforce the mask mandate in light of Mizelle’s decision, according to CNN. The Biden administration was dismayed by the ruling. “This is obviously a disappointing decision,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki said at a press briefing on Monday. “The CDC continues recommending wearing a mask in public transit.” .@PressSec Jen Psaki on Florida federal judge overturning CDC mask mandates for public transit: ""This is obviously a disappointing decision.

The Senate voted last month to overturn the public health order requiring masks on airplanes and public transit, and, as the Post points out, 21 states, most of which are led by Republicans, sued the government seeking to end the mask mandate. CEOs from airline companies have also urged Biden to lift the mandate. Fortunately for the mandate’s opponents, the former president was able to appoint a slew of unqualified judges.
