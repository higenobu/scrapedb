5/3/2022,"After two years of big spending to weather the storm of Covid-19, New Zealand’s finance minister is tightening the belt, committing to limits on borrowing, introducing new debt caps and looking ahead to long-term spending on infrastructure over short-term cash injections. The finance minister, Grant Robertson, gave a glimpse of the vision for New Zealand’s post-Covid economy in his first major pre-budget speech on Tuesday. This year’s budget will also help set the political scene as the country heads towards a 2023 election. The finances will not be announced until 19 May, but Robertson’s initial outline indicates that if the past two years of spending were branded the “rebuilding” and “recovery” budgets, then this year’s could perhaps be dubbed the “rebalancing” budget. “As we move to a new normal post the peak of Covid, it is the right time to resume a set of fiscal rules to carefully manage costs while planning for the future,” Robertson said. Robertson said it was the fourth budget the Jacinda Ardern-led government had put together using the “wellbeing approach”, which includes a broader range of outcomes including human health to assess policy success and which first grabbed international headlines in 2019. With rising inflation and the ongoing disruptions from Covid, supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine, this year will run at a deficit, with the next surplus expected in 2024-25. Robertson announced that once surplus is reached, the government is committed to maintaining a small surplus of between zero to 2% of GDP over 10 years. “The surplus target will also be the primary rule that controls our spending decisions and will require a careful and balanced approach,” he said, adding that there will be allowances made for significant shocks. Robertson also announced the government had accepted Treasury’s recommendation that New Zealand start using a headline debt measure closer to the international norm, which will make for a more accurate comparison against other nations. That will mean including a wider range of crown assets and debt held by other crown entities that had not previously been covered. A new debt ceiling cap of 30% of GDP will also be introduced (a change from 50% under the current system), to “ensure New Zealand maintains some of the lowest government debt in the world”, Robertson said. “It is a limit rather than a target and again is flexible enough to allow a buffer against short-term shocks, while providing room for productive investment.” Infrastructure, health and the environment will be the focus of this year’s spending – with a one-off $6bn injection going towards a new streamlined health system and helping reduce emissions. But the greatest current pressure on people’s day to day lives – the cost of living – did not feature in Robertson’s speech. When asked whether the budget would target high living costs he said: “We’ll always look to see if there are ways we can support New Zealanders, but the priorities of the budget have been made clear and they are health and the environment.” Robertson was eager to point out New Zealand’s comparatively stable economic position. GDP is up 5.6% from a year ago, while the unemployment rate is at a record low of 3.2%, despite early pandemic predictions that it could rise as high as 10%. The nation’s debt is set to peak at about half of Australia’s, around a third of that of the UK and around a fifth of the US, according to the latest international monetary fund outlook. With the spectre of the 2023 election beginning to loom, Robertson’s careful language around prudent and balanced spending could be an attempt to hold on to votes the Labour party snatched at the previous election from the centre-right National party – the party usually viewed as more fiscally responsible. When asked if the budget was a response to the opposition’s accusation that the government was “addicted to spending”, Robertson said: “Every government in the world had to respond to Covid and New Zealand responded in such a way that we’ve come through with one of the best economic results and one of the best health results in the world.” It was necessary to spend money to cushion the blow to New Zealanders during the pandemic, but now is the time to apply clear fiscal rules, Robertson said. “As a person who came to my political consciousness in the 1980s I know the damage that can be done when we lose the balance of our fiscal position.” “This will be a pivotal change as we move towards a high-wage, low-emissions economy that provides economic security in good times and bad.”",News/World news,New Zealand finance minister tightens the belt for first post-Covid budget,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/new-zealand-finance-minister-tightens-the-belt-for-first-post-covid-budget
5/3/2022,"Politics – personal, contemporary and historic – were close to the surface on New York’s Upper East Side on Monday night as 600 guests, invited to celebrate America’s Gilded Age at the Met Gala, offered their own interpretation of style and the multitude of meanings dress carries then as now. Singer Alicia Keys wore a cape celebrating New York union history. New York Mayor Eric Adams, who had said he’d been “dying to go” to the fundraiser “for years”, arrived on the red carpet wearing a jacket with decorative forearms and lapels that paid homage to the New York transit system. The back of his coat read “End Gun Violence” in red lettering. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton came in a dress inspired by friendship quilts inscribed with the names, she explained, of “gutsy women” of the 19th and 20th century liberation movements. But the celebration of women’s progress toward equal rights came as news surfaced that the US supreme court had provisionally voted to overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark ruling that legalised abortion nationwide in America, according to a draft opinion reported on by Politico. Politics at the event returned again when Kim Kardashian appeared on the red carpet in the iconic dress Marilyn Monroe wore to coo Happy Birthday to President Kennedy in 1962. The Kardashian star reportedly paid $4.8m for the dress at auction. Hamish Bowles, the World of Interiors editor, sporting a raffish matinee idol moustache and gold tiara, said “tonight our hearts are with the people of Ukraine and the victims of war and displacement around the world.” The publisher, the major sponsor of the event, had made a donation to the Red Cross and encouraged “those who can to do so as well.” Dame Anna Wintour’s “In America: An Anthology of Fashion”-themed ball kicked off at the Metropolitan Museum of Art with Priscilla Presley on hand to pitch Baz Luhrmann’s upcoming Elvis movie; “Gucci from head-to-toe,” said Anderson Paak. “I’m doing blade, vampire tip,” said Ashton Sanders. Riz Ahmed, in T-shirt and workers shirt, said he was “trying elevate and celebrate working-class immigrants.” Amy Schumer said“when Gabriella Hearst offers to dress you put your Spanx on right over your c-section scar.” Janelle Monáe promoted her sc-fi book. Blake Lively came as the Statute of Liberty. The Met Gala is a commercial proposition, light years away from its creation, in 1946, by publicist Eleanor Lambert who is credited with bringing European fashion to America. Influential trade publication the Business of Fashion (BoF) said this year’s event might be the “most important Met Gala” of Wintour’s career. After two years of interruption – one cancelled by Covid-19; another under-attended due to international travel bans and vaccine requirements – Monday’s gala was reported to have returned to full strength. With tables costing $200,000 to $300,000, last year’s event in September raised $16.4m for the Costume Institute. But it’s also a money-maker for Vogue. According to Amy Odell’s newly published biography on Wintour, now Condé Nast’s global chief content officer, it is the publisher’s pitch to sell advertising. This year it is also a pitch to sell online subscriptions to Vogue.com and corral visitors to the Met museum. “At the end of the day, this is an extremely important fundraiser,” Anna-Lisa Yabsley, Condé Nast head of digital strategy, told BoF. “Everything we do content-wise is about raising awareness and getting people through the door.” Vogue is charging $1m for two, six-second spots on its Met Gala stream over the course of two hours, according to BoF. Tracking data shows Vogue’s Met Gala stream pulled 16m views, along with 260m gala-related views across social media. According to tracking firm Launchmetrics, the night generates $543m in media impact value, or the effect of placements and mentions — compared to the Super Bowl’s $520m. According to BoF, the more Vogue can market the Met Gala as the Super Bowl of fashion, the more it will be able to charge. Earlier Monday, first lady Dr. Jill Biden kicked off a preview of the show, which features nine commissioned films by directors including Radha Blank, Janicza Bravo, Sofia Coppola, Julie Dash, Autumn de Wilde, and Zhao, last year’s Oscar winner. The films celebrate overlooked figures in early American fashion, especially female designers, and especially those of color. Costume Institute curator Andrew Bolton said when announcing the show, “have been forgotten, overlooked, or relegated to a footnote in the annals of fashion history.” The Met Ball itself, fashion activists have said, has long been an opportunity for greater inclusivity than the structure of the publisher, or its pages, had embraced until racial protests in 2020. In her remarks, Jill Biden said that “style helps us express things that can’t be put in words.” “The way we carry ourselves, how we put our shoulders back when times are hard, or offer a friendly smile even when we don’t agree. How we choose to show up for our communities – the small acts of kindness that are remembered long after they are offered.”She continued: “And that includes what we wear.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Met Gala 2022: politics rises to the surface in fashion’s biggest night,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/03/met-gala-2022-politics-rises-to-the-surface-in-fashions-biggest-night
5/3/2022,"Lydia Ko, golf’s world No 3, has been praised for normalising the impact of periods on women in sport after rendering a male interviewer speechless with her answer to a question about some on-course treatment she received at an LPGA event in California. The New Zealander was seen being stretched out by her physiotherapist midway through the final round of the Palos Verdes Championship on Sunday, prompting Golf Channel commentator Jerry Foltz to inquire whether the tightness in her back and hips would be a recurring problem. “I hope not,” said Ko. “It’s that time of the month. I know the ladies watching are probably like, yeah, I got you. “So, when that happens, my back gets really tight, and I’m all twisted. It’s not the first time that Chris has seen me twisted, but it felt a lot better after he came. So, yeah, there you go.” ""It's that time of the month. I know the ladies watching are probably like, 'Yeah, I got you.'""Lydia Ko kept it real in her post-round interview after the @PV_Champ 😂🙌 pic.twitter.com/00swxr3Euv Foltz floundered as he searched for a suitable response, and could only come up with “thanks”. Ko, for her part, was able to laugh off the awkward moment, saying: “I know you’re at a loss for words, Jerry. Honesty it is.” Ko was widely lauded for being candid about an issue which evidently causes embarrassment in some circles, and is rarely talked about openly. There is a growing understanding of the effects of menstruation and pre-menstrual symdrome on female athletes. Some professional sportswomen have their periods monitored by their sport’s governing body, with training adapted to suit different points of their cycle. But it is only recently that athletes have spoken publicly about how it can impede performance. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Chinese swimmer Fu Yuanhui earned plaudits after her team came in fourth place in the 4x100m medley relay, telling reporters “my period started last night so I’m feeling pretty weak and really tired”. In 2015, British tennis player Heather Watson put her poor Australian Open performance down to starting her period. After Ko’s comments, Marama Davidson, the New Zealand Greens co-leader, said the issue of period pain was “definitely not acknowledged enough”. Great work Joe Porter on @NZMorningReport just now towards normalising the issue of period pain for athletes in light of Lydia Ko speaking plainly about menstruation symptoms. Definitely not acknowledged enough. Clinical psychologist Karen Nimmo, who has worked extensively with high performance athletes, told New Zealand’s Today FM it was refreshing to hear a truthful account of menstruation’s effect on performance, rather than it being hidden behind other “ailments”. “It’s really healthy that we actually mention it as a normal part of sport that has to be factored in, not just physically, but also psychologically. We have to consider that people go through cycles and we have to think about that when we are planning training and events.”“Menstrual problems are a common part of elite sport, and finally we have a gateway to discuss it,” Nimmo said. “So go Lydia, I say.” Lydia Ko just said…“It’s that time of the month. You know, my back hurts.”@JerryFoltzGC had absolutely no idea how to follow up.My night (maybe year) has been made. 😂😂😂 Despite Ko’s discomfort, the 25-year-old former world No 1 finished second at the tournament in Los Angeles, two strokes behind winner Marina Alex.",Sport/Sport,‘That time of the month’: golfer Lydia Ko stuns reporter after talking about period,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/03/that-time-of-the-month-golfer-lydia-ko-stuns-reporter-after-talking-about-period
5/3/2022,"Some Pacific island nations have been left walking a geopolitical tightrope in their response to the war in Ukraine, as they try to balance regional alliances with both the west and China and Russia. Comments by Russian president Vladimir Putin, which many have interpreted as thinly veiled threats about the potential use of nuclear weapons have also touched a nerve in a region long affected by the catastrophic effects of nuclear weapons testing by the US, France and Britain. Pacific leaders have broadly lambasted the Russian assault, with the Federated States of Micronesia even going so far as to sever diplomatic ties with Russia the day after the invasion was launched. Micronesia’s president David Panuelo accused Moscow of engaging in “numerous war crimes,” writing, “There is no nuance in Russia’s behaviour; they are choosing to act as villains.” In Fiji, where the acceptance of donated Russian arms and military training in 2016 raised concerns, the high court ruled last month that the government in Suva was within its rights to prevent a super yacht called Amadea, from leaving the Fijian port where it is docked while a US seizure application is determined. The US alleges the yacht is owned by Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, who is the subject of US and European economic sanctions. Defence lawyers dispute that. Ten Pacific island nations were also among 93 countries that voted to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council last month. Two Pacific states, however, did not. Vanuatu abstained and Solomon Islands did not vote. Mihai Sora, a research fellow with the Lowy Institute and former Australian diplomat, noted that Melanesian countries have tried to develop relations with both western powers as well as China and Russia, seeking to avoid appearing too close to either side. “Solomon Islands and Vanuatu stand out as two Pacific countries that have been actively pursuing closer relations with China at the political level in recent years,” Sora said. Beijing has abstained on UN security council resolutions condemning the war and has also echoed, and amplified, Kremlin talking points in official media outlets, blaming Nato for the conflict. This month Solomon Islands signed a security pact with China which could allow for Chinese security personnel and warships to enter the country to protect Chinese interests. In recent years, Sora said, analysts have also seen Vanuatu as a potential host for a Chinese military base, despite denials by both nations. Vanuatu, Sora added, has also maintained closer ties to Russia relative to other Pacific nations. In 2011, it briefly established diplomatic relations with Abkhazia, a breakaway region in the Caucasus nation of Georgia, aligning itself with Russian interests. “By abstaining on the human rights council vote, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu may be seeking to have it both ways,” Sora said, suggesting the two countries don’t want to entirely contradict China or Russia, nor do they want to run counter to Australia, New Zealand, and the rest of the Pacific. Neither the UN missions for Vanuatu or Solomon Islands responded to requests for comment. In the early days of the war, Putin put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert and as his offensive shifts to Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, he has overseen the testing of a Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, describing it as “food for thought for those who … try to threaten our country”. Casten Nemra, minister of foreign affairs in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), where the US conducted 67 nuclear tests in the 1940s and 50s, said Putin’s references to nuclear weapons were “utterly irresponsible and sheer madness”. “Nuclear weapons bring nothing but total destruction … even many decades later, we continue to this day [to] experience the negative effects on our environment, health, and communities.” The country also co-founded the Group of Friends of Accountability with Ukraine and four other UN member states aimed at “ensuring accountability for international crimes committed following the Russian invasion of Ukraine”. In French Polynesia, where France carried out 193 nuclear tests between 1966 and 1996, Putin’s comments are also a reminder of the true cost of nuclear weapons and colonial conquest. Vehia Wheeler, a Tahiti-based environmental and human rights activist, said that it was absurd that there was still talk of the use of nuclear weapons in 2022 “after all the work that people have been doing and have been working towards, reparations, preventing [nuclear weapons] from being used, that this is even an option.” However, she said the UN vote to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council smacked of hypocrisy. “I think that’s really interesting that the UN will vote against Russia, kicking them out of the Human Rights Council when obviously the US and France have been horrendous human rights violators considering the fact that they’ve already conducted nuclear tests on us in the Pacific for years,” Wheeler said.",News/World news,"Pacific nations walk geopolitical tightrope over Ukraine war, as nuclear legacy looms",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/pacific-nations-walk-geopolitical-tightrope-over-ukraine-war-as-nuclear-legacy-looms
