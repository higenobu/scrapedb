5/7/2022,"Should a hospital introduce a mandatory vaccination programme to stop a breakout of infant disease when one of five children will become ill from the vaccine? Should an AI company programme a self-driving car to save its passengers at any cost? Should a government torture a prisoner to extract information that is certain to save many lives? In Trolley Problem, Inc – a game named after the well-known philosophical dilemma by which an onlooker can choose to divert a runaway trolley to kill one person instead of five – you have 40 seconds to answer these and scores of other ethical quandaries. As the timer drains, a well-spoken, gently sarcastic female commentator articulates the counterargument to your intended choice. The game begins with decades-old dilemmas drawn from philosophical papers, and pleasingly includes references and a reading list for those who want to locate the sources. These scenarios are then escalated to comic effect. After each choice you’re presented with a growing receipt that details the cost of your choices: the cumulative number of people killed, jobs lost, innocents imprisoned, children infected, and so on. The game also indicates whether you have sided with most other players, or whether yours is a minority verdict. The contextualising story – that you are a brilliant philosopher, hired by a series of companies and government agencies as a sort of moralist-in-chief – is unconvincing as either straight fiction or satire. But the game’s experimental substance has a novel quality. By presenting unsolvable yet feasible questions in rapid succession, under a time limit, it reveals the flaws and inconsistencies in every person’s moral scaffolding. Unless you cleave to an inflexible rule to, say, never intervene in a way that will threaten life, or to always minimise fatalities, you are likely to find yourself assuming contradictory positions. In this way, Trolley Problem, Inc succeeds in being both absurd and provocative.",Arts/Games,"Trolley Problem, Inc review – a thrill ride into the world of ethical dilemmas",https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/may/07/trolley-problem-inc-review-a-thrill-ride-into-the-world-of-ethical-dilemmas
5/7/2022,"The Green party has hailed what it has described as “phenomenal” local election results, as it headed above 80 gains in areas including South Tyneside, Cumberland, Oxford and Worcester. Following the pattern of recent local elections, in which the Greens have both won more seats and extended the geographical spread of their representation, by Friday night the party had won 156 seats, with a net gain of 81. It took seats from both Labour and the Conservatives. Illustrating again how the party is competing in areas that would not have been seen as strongholds only a few years ago, the Greens made three gains on South Tyneside council, taking two seats from Labour and one from the Tories. The party now has six seats, making it the second largest on the council, albeit well behind still-dominant Labour. In Burnley, where the Greens secured their first councillor in 2018, they gained one seat from the Conservatives by 11 votes. In Worthing in West Sussex, three gains moved the council from being Labour-run to no overall control. In Oxford, the Green party’s four victories included three gains, one of which unseated a longstanding and senior Labour councillor, Colin Cook, formerly lord mayor of the city. In Worcester, a Green gain helped push the council from being Conservative-run into no overall control, a result the Tory leader, Marc Bayliss, said was a “bad night” for his party, something he argued was caused in part by voter concern at lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street. The Greens also gained their first councillor in Plymouth, and took two seats in the elections for the newly created Cumberland council. These results on Friday were mainly for England, with Wales and Scotland – in the latter, the Greens are a separate organisation – being declared later. In one early Scottish result, the SNP leader of Glasgow city council has been overtaken by the Scottish Greens on first preference votes in the city’s Langside ward. New candidate Holly Bruce topped the ballot with 3,173 first-preference votes, while the SNP’s Susan Aitken received 2,899. Adrian Ramsay, the Greens’ co-leader, who took over the role with Carla Denyer in October last year, said the expectation was that further gains would come: “The phenomenal results for the Green party so far demonstrate that people up and down the country are looking for a credible alternative to the establishment parties, and finding it in us. “Whether that’s former Conservative voters put off by poor handling of the Covid pandemic or the constant leadership lies, or former Labour voters who just see weak opposition at a national and local level. “Greens are putting forward the practical solutions to the cost of living crisis and the climate emergency that will make a difference to people’s lives, from insulating homes to bringing down energy bills and creating jobs, to providing additional financial support for those on the lowest incomes.” Elsewhere, in one of the more niche if most bitterly contested subplots of the local elections, candidates who explicitly opposed the schemes known as low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) appeared to fare badly. LTNs, which seek to encourage cycling and walking by using filters or bollards to block through traffic on some smaller residential streets, while allowing pedestrians and cyclists to pass, have proved a divisive innovation in a series of areas including London, Oxford and Birmingham. A series of dedicated anti-LTN independent candidates stood, while in some places, notably in a series of London boroughs, Conservative and even Lib Dem candidates promised to remove them. No anti-LTN independents won in Friday’s results, although one, standing in Oxford, finished a reasonably close second to Labour. Campaigners’ hopes to unseat pro-LTN Labour candidates in London boroughs like Southwark came to nothing. One potential exception was Enfield, another hotbed of the debate, where the Tories gained eight seats from Labour.",News/Politics,Greens celebrate ‘phenomenal’ gains in local elections across England,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/greens-local-election-results-2022-gains
5/7/2022,"The first season of Love Life (BBC One) centred on Darby Carter, played by Anna Kendrick, and the relationships that defined her life. Some were loving, some were sexual, some were friendly, some a combination of all three, but each of the strands came together to form a neat and charming series about modern life and romance in an arty social corner of New York City. It was a great idea, executed well, and it had an old-fashioned spark to it. Kendrick, rarely unappealing in anything, sold it completely. This second outing proves it wasn’t just Kendrick who carried the show. The format – most of the episodes focus on, or lead to, a partner of some description – works just as well when transplanted on to someone else’s love life. In this case, it’s Marcus Watkins (The Good Place’s William Jackson Harper), a book editor in his 30s who is married to a woman named Emily. Marcus is a guest at Darby’s wedding in 2016, at which point this forks off from the first season. The big difference is that this isn’t chasing the thrills of Marcus’s youth. Instead, he has already settled down – though there wouldn’t be much drama if his marriage were in fine fettle and each episode dealt with his and Emily’s domestic bliss. Instead, Marcus meets a woman named Mia, with whom he hits it off instantly. Their friendship ignites, crossing an already blurry line and confusing everyone involved. In the non-love part of his life, he is equally dissatisfied. The racism of the publishing world, and the fact that he is stuck editing books by influencers and not the next great novelist, is making him unhappy, though he is experiencing low-level malaise, rather than great despair. He starts to feel the need for change in every aspect of his life. Watching someone in their 30s work out how to become the person they want to be, and the right person to help them on their way to that, makes for a different series than the first, but one that is just as effective. Harper’s performance as Marcus is a big part of it. It’s a great skill to take someone who behaves in an objectively terrible way at the outset and turn them into a character the audience roots for wholeheartedly. Love Life is always going to be a deeply romantic series, despite the wobbly routes it takes to get there. That’s part of its appeal, and it does romance impeccably. But it avoids being too sickly sweet, throwing in a touch of realism so all those meet-cutes don’t overwhelm. People behave well and they behave badly; sometimes there are reasons for that, and sometimes there are not. It finds all those human flaws buried within its fairytale facade. This is billed as a romcom, but it’s more of a rom-dram. We follow Marcus through his divorce, one-night stands, hook-ups with old school friends, dates that go nowhere. It plays fast and loose with time. Some episodes cover a night out; others take in months. We get to know his parents, his sister, his workplace, over the course of five years. It goes by quickly, and this makes a strong case for every episode of every series to be no more than 30 minutes long. There is no room for dramatic malingering in such a tight timeframe. Eventually, Marcus figures it out, just as Darby did before him. It takes a lot of missteps and mistakes and clever moves to get there. It isn’t clear who he will end up with, until it is. But watching this delightful show weave all those elements together until it finds a path to satisfaction is a real treat.",Arts/Television & radio,Love Life review – this deeply romantic drama portrays love impeccably,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/06/love-life-review-william-jackson-harper
