1/26/2022,"A first edition of Diamonds Are Forever, in which Ian Fleming thanks his friend and fellow author Paul Gallico for “spread[ing] his wings over my first-born [Casino Royale]”, is set to be auctioned on Friday as Gallico’s private library goes up for sale. Gallico, who died in 1976, worked with Fleming as a journalist on the Sunday Times. The James Bond author sent him the initial typescript of Casino Royale to see if it was publishable; Gallico told him it was a “knockout”, adding that Fleming’s torture scene “beats everything I have ever read”, and that the novel “goes in for frankness and detail far beyond any American-type thriller and could have a big sale”. “Get out of that office kid and write,” urged the American author of novels including The Snow Goose and The Poseidon Adventure in a letter included in John Pearson’s biography of Fleming.  While his papers are at Columbia University, Gallico’s private library has remained in his island home on Antibes since his death. It reveals the closeness between the two writers: “To Paul, who spread his wings over my first-born, 1956,” writes Fleming in the first edition of Diamonds Are Forever, which is expected to fetch £12,000-£18,000 at Chiswick Auctions on 27 January. In a first edition of Casino Royale, Fleming writes “To Paul from Balzache 1953” – a play on “balls/ache”, said Chiswick Auctions. Along with personal artefacts including Gallico’s leather Abercrombie & Fitch flying jacket from his time as a war correspondent, and his typewriters, the collection also reveals Gallico’s friendships with luminaries including Noël Coward, who wrote to him: “I was riveted by ‘Poseidon’ from beginning to end [...] I didn’t actually read it hanging upside down from a glass chandelier, but I was certainly hanging from the chandelier for several days after”. Marlene Dietrich writes in a telegram, “Thinking of you. Lonesome down under, Marlene”, while Graham Greene, a neighbour of Gallico’s on Antibes, gave him a first edition of his novel A Burnt-Out Case. The inscription reads: “For Paul Gallico – arrears for gratitudes to Antibes … From Graham Greene, 1961.” “The collection is a tangible reminder of a writer whose presence and works continue to entertain us, inspire us, so many years after his death,” said Clive Moss, head of rare books at Chiswick Auctions, describing Gallico as “a supreme writer and talent with an enduring quality that never fails to entice and capture our attention”.

1/26/2022,"The luxury carmaker Bentley has announced that its first fully electric car will be developed and built at its Crewe factory. The British brand’s first battery electric vehicle is scheduled to roll off the production line in 2025.  Bentley, which has been making cars since 1919 and is now owned by Germany’s Volkswagen, has committed to investing £2.5bn in sustainability over the next 10 years. This will include what the company called the “complete transformation” of all Bentley vehicles and its Crewe plant, which employs 4,000 workers. Workers who build the brand’s internal combustion engines will be retrained and redeployed to work in different areas of the plant. The carmaker, known for its large and powerful cars, announced in late 2020 that it would stop making vehicles that run on fossil fuel by 2030, aiming to make its operations fully carbon neutral by the same date. Sales of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in the UK from 2030. As part of the brand’s Beyond100 strategy, mapping out its plans beyond its centenary, the company set itself ambitious targets in the transition towards electric vehicles. In Bentley’s switch from building cars with traditional internal combustion engines, it will first make hybrid vehicles, before introducing its first pure electric cars, with zero-carbon exhaust emissions. The company has not revealed any details of its first fully electric car. Adrian Hallmark, Bentley’s chairman and chief executive, said: “Securing production of our first BEV in Crewe is a milestone moment for Bentley, and the UK, as we plan for a long-term sustainable future in Crewe.” Bentley’s plant at its Cheshire headquarters will be turned into an advanced manufacturing facility as part of its move towards environmental sustainability. The carmaker, whose vehicles cost from about £130,000 to more than £240,000, has previously said its environmental targets would help it to be “financially resilient and recession proof” after the coronavirus pandemic. Electric vehicle sales boomed in 2021, according to recent figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, as carmakers sold 190,000 battery electric cars, accounting for almost 12% of total sales.",News/Business,Bentley to build its first fully electric car at Crewe factory,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/26/bentley-to-build-its-first-fully-electric-car-at-crewe-factory
1/26/2022,"The Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) and Fifa have been accused of “going silent” over allegations that female referees were sexually harassed by Zifa officials. The allegations – made against Zifa’s referees committee secretary general, Obert Zhoya, and its chairman, Bryton Malandule – were first reported by local media in September 2020 before two of the alleged victims, both referees, officially registered their complaints with the Zifa board.  The allegations were also sent to Fifa, the global game’s governing body, the Confederation of African Football (Caf), and the Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (Cosafa). It was not until the alleged victims reported the claims to police, in December 2021, that a formal investigation was launched. One of the alleged victims, who did not want to be named, told the Guardian that she had not officiated since making the complaints and felt “emotionally drained” by the whole experience. “Zifa is a huge disappointment,” she said. “I’ve told myself I can never rely on them. I had high hopes that Fifa would intervene and fight to defend us female referees but they let me down as well. My question is why would Fifa go silent? I’m not saying they have to rush and make my case a first priority but at least show me that you’re keen to assist me.” One alleged victim said she had been “humiliated, intimidated and degraded” by Zhoya, claiming she had received a series of WhatsApp messages from him asking for her to spend the night with him in a hotel. “I would like to put on record that he had been making these unwelcome sexual advances since September 2019,” she wrote in a letter to Zifa. “The allegations I make herein are backed by evidence in the form of phone call voice recordings. I then got the courage from the evidence I had, and learning that I’m not the only one [who] was subject to this harassment. “I have been on the Zifa [referees] panel since 2019, I’m 30 years old. I expected to be treated with respect, not like a lady of the night. I however request you to look into the matter and possibly address the issue and in the process protect me and my fellow female referees who are suffering silently.” Another official accused Malandule, who is also a member of the Zifa board, of making “sexual advances” towards her in March 2019. Contacted by the Guardian, Malandule said: “I am sure that you appreciate that when issues are before judicial bodies, one cannot comment as per the sub judice rule.” Zhoya had not responded to the Guardian’s request for comment at the time of publication. Another experienced referee claimed she has been “frozen out” of officiating at matches for offering support to alleged victims. She claimed several more officials are too afraid to report abuse claims because of the way the cases have been handled. She said: “These reports were made immediately when the stories came out and we have gone more than a year without anything being done or any feedback. I think Fifa should have kept in touch with the victims to reassure them that they are still working on it. By going quiet, it seems like it is a minor issue. The girls feel very, very bitter about their experiences.” In November, the entire Zifa board was suspended by the Zimbabwe government’s sports and recreation commission (SRC) over “several incidents of gross incompetence” that the SRC described as “contrary to the national interest”. As well as alleged mismanagement and lack of accountability in the use of public funds, it cited the allegations of sexual harassment of female referees. Fifa disapproves of governmental interference in the running of member associations. It warned Zimbabwe that it could be banned from the Africa Cup of Nations unless the elected FA was restored by 3 January 2022 – a threat that failed to materialise. “There are clear rules in the Fifa statutes that prohibit any undue third-party interference in the affairs of any Fifa member association,” a Fifa spokesperson said. In December 2021 Joyce Cook, Fifa’s chief social responsibility and education officer, said Fifa had referred the sexual harassment allegations to Caf for three months because it “did not have the competence to investigate and judge such conducts”. A Fifa spokesperson told the Guardian: “The Fifa ethics committee is aware of the allegations and a process is ongoing in accordance with the rules of competence set out in article 30 of the code of ethics. Please understand we cannot comment further at this stage.” A Caf spokesperson said: “Caf is aware of the matter. We have been in touch with the relevant authorities in the country because it is now a matter being handled by the relevant competent authorities in that country. There is nothing further Caf would say at this stage.” A global investigative network intended to tackle sexual abuse across all sports is due to be established by Fifa and a United Nations agency this year in the wake of the scandals in Afghanistan and Haiti revealed by the Guardian.",Sport/Football,Zimbabwe FA and Fifa accused of ‘silence’ over sexual harassment claims,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/26/zimbabwe-fa-and-fifa-accused-of-silence-over-sexual-harassment-claims
1/26/2022,"In keeping with the times, Bill Manning did his own research. Toronto FC’s president was inspired in his online trawling not by pandemic conspiracies but Canada’s sporting past.  Manning’s stunning and successful pursuit of Napoli and Italy star Lorenzo Insigne ended earlier this month with the winger becoming the richest recruit in Major League Soccer history. It began with Manning in front of a laptop scouring transfermarkt.com for the kind of stop-the-world signing that this moment in Canadian football was calling for, if not demanding. “Lorenzo Insigne is going to be a player that people want to come see,” Manning said when the deal, which sees Insigne paid $15m a year over the next four years, was confirmed. “We think the World Cup here in Toronto in 2026 [is] going to be a transformational moment for this sport in this country and we want to be at the forefront.” The transfer’s ambition and execution was impressive. But Manning might have still been a little off on one of his numbers. That transformational moment may come a whole lot sooner than the summer of 2026. In truth there’s a feeling in Canada that over the past six months, it has already begun. In August the Canadian women’s team claimed historic Olympic gold in Tokyo. Then the men’s team continued their emergence as the most improved side in the world. When you add in the Insigne coup, this has been a period without parallel north of the 49th. On the eve of a six-day international window which could end with Canada qualifying for a men’s World Cup for the first time since the 1980s, the idea that Canada has now become a football nation is inching away from provocative quote tweet territory and towards reality. “It’s the definition of serious momentum, isn’t it?” Steven Caldwell told the Guardian this week. “There’s no other way to look at it than to say that the sport in this country is at the highest point it’s ever been.” Caldwell, like many in and around the Canadian game, is a blow-in. First, second and next-generation Canadians have long clawed for football’s place in the sporting hierarchy here. Caldwell has called the country home for nine years but is particularly well-placed to survey the change. The former Scotland defender also captained Toronto FC, is an analyst for Canadian network TSN and was part of the Canadian men’s backroom team as recently as last summer. “To see that national team success – women’s and men’s – that aspirational value of seeing a team win a gold medal or atop the final qualifying stage for a World Cup, it’s incredible,” Caldwell said. “[TFC owners] MLSE have felt the moment. Insigne coming to TFC is a byproduct of the successes of the national teams, particularly the men’s. The fact that they’re tracking towards the World Cup and there’s this fervour, viewing figures through the roof, that excitement of what’s next, MLSE don’t want to miss out on that.” Where Manning’s first-Insigne-and-then-the-world energy might have been scoffed at not too long ago, it’s now, rightly, lauded. MLSE also own the NBA’s Raptors and Toronto’s most etched-in-ice (and infamy) team, the NHL’s Maple Leafs. Insigne’s contract will see him rival most of the highest-paid Raptors and eclipse every Leafs player. A gamble? Perhaps. But also a sign of the times. And maybe a more permanent change. John Herdman and his team of effervescent youth, stubborn and sturdy experience and all focus and heart won minds and eyes too as they took early control of the final stage of Qatar 2022 qualifying over the fall. The numbers tell the tale: when Alphonso Davies lit up Toronto with an electrifying goal to down Panama in October, the TV audience was 342,000. The following month when Jonathan David grabbed the only goal against Costa Rica that number doubled. Four days later a landmark was passed when almost 1.2 million watched the historic 2-1 triumph over Mexico on a frigid night in Edmonton. “The game against Mexico was up there with NHL games going on at the same time,” Adam Seaborn, a Toronto-based sports marketing and audience expert, told the Guardian. “What it tells me when you go to such a big number in such a short space of time, is something we have seen here before – when a Canadian story emerges, viewership can spike dramatically. The country loves a Canadian story and it becomes a big thing.” Herdman is a coach and leader who leans into narratives and plotlines. He discusses themes as freely as teams, litters press conferences with talk of moments and missions. At the start of qualifying he spoke to the Guardian about proving that “a guy who’s read 400 books is [as capable of succeeding as a coach] as a guy who’s played 400 games.” Canada's Sam Adekugbe really dived into the snow after Cyle Larin got his brace 🤣(via @CBSSportsGolazo) pic.twitter.com/1fifNSu1Tx So far, he has. Never more so than in November when Edmonton’s Commonwealth Stadium became the Iceteca and Mexico froze in the frenzy. Defender Sam Adekugbe’s celebratory dive into a pitch-side snowbank instantly became what is known in these parts as a Canadian heritage moment. The country continues to buy in. Sunday’s meeting with the US in Hamilton (sandwiched between away games against Honduras and El Salvador) sold out before tickets even went on general sale. With Drake and Justin Trudeau clamouring for a selfie, Davies is becoming the kind of cultural, crossover star that no male footballer has ever come close to being here. Caldwell marvels at how far the men’s team has come. While the women’s team, who Herdman coached before switching jobs, kept the fire burning for so long, their male counterparts floundered. Not just decades in the wilderness after their solitary World Cup appearance in 1986 but fresh nadirs even in the past decade, an 8-1 humbling by Honduras in 2012 the lowest low. “Playing for Scotland, you know your gran is watching, everyone is watching the country,” Caldwell said. “When I came here to Canada I never had that feeling. I never even knew there were national team games on. I’d wonder where a couple of my teammates [had] gone. I couldn’t believe it.” When Herdman took over in 2019, Canada were 94th in the men’s rankings, just above the Faroe Islands. When 2021 finished, they were 40th, named Fifa’s most-improved side, sat top of Concacaf qualifying as its top scorers, joint-best defence and only unbeaten side. What’s perhaps most impressive is that Herdman and his staff have taken a gifted young generation who don’t carry the scars of the past and blended it with some who do: their 39-year-old captain Atiba Hutchison is healing and defying age in midfield. Herdman has also unearthed gems who’ve caught the eyes of Europe’s elite. Even since that Mexico game, winger Tajon Buchanan linked up with Club Brugge and midfielder Stephen Eustáquio joined Porto. Lille striker David is likely to soon join Bayern Munich’s Davies among the upper, upper echelon. In such a pivotal three-game window and with so much on the line, the loss of Davies (due to Covid complications) for the upcoming matches could have crushed previous Canadian generations. Not so this one. “The collective sum of their parts is what they live by, so I don’t think they’ll be fazed,” insisted Caldwell. “They believe 100% that they can win the group and that’s important. It’s all about proving that point. “John has done great things in terms of the culture. These guys understand that it’s about the code of the shirt and a nation, getting to change the game forever in this country.”",Sport/Football,Olympic gold to Qatar 2022?

1/26/2022,"The Arizona Republican congressman Paul Gosar had a simple message for the crowd when he recently addressed a packed Donald Trump rally in his home state – a gathering that had focused on promoting the baseless lie that Trump had been cheated out of a second term as president. “This is where it all began,” Gosar said in a speech before Trump came on stage. “This is where we questioned: ‘Was there fraud? Absolutely. Was it enough to overturn the election? Absolutely.’”  The far-right congressman is one of Trump’s most loyal backers in Congress, earning him one of more than 90 endorsements made so far by the former US president ahead of this year’s crucial midterm elections. Gosar is the kind of politician that Trump – who is embarking on a series of rallies to try to cement his allies’ power in the Republican party – is increasingly seeking to support. But Gosar has extensive links to white nationalists and Capitol rioters and, many observers say, represents a dangerous new breed of Republican politician, who would have once been considered fringe, but whom Trump is increasingly making central to Republican party politics. “I’m considered the most dangerous man in Congress,” Gosar told the crowd, briefly touching on popular rightwing talking points – critical race theory in schools, disrespect for the military, and “empty shelves” in stores – before focusing on the central theme of the rally: elections. In the Arizona desert the fervor among supporters huddled against the wind was a clear sign of the size of a constituency more loyal to Trump than to the party, and even as some lawmakers distance themselves from the former president amid the January 6 fallout, the far right is doubling down. In his first public appearance since the anniversary of the January 6 attack, Trump’s appearance was marked with a reaffirmation of election denial, conspiracy theories and anti-democratic ruminations. “I ran twice, and I won twice,” Trump told his supporters gathered in the windy Arizona night. At the rally the “Stop the Steal” organizer Ali Alexander moved through the crowd while on stage three members of Congress, who all voted against certifying Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential election victory, gave speeches affirming their support of the “big lie”. Gosar’s allegiance to Trump and his false claims extends beyond speaking the shibboleth of the big lie: on January 6 Gosar voted against certifying the election even as rioters penetrated the Capitol. “We no longer have an ability to make a clear delineation between the right and far-right in the Republican party,” said Joe Lowndes, professor of political science at the University of Oregon and co-author of Producers, Parasites, Patriots: Race and the New Right-Wing Politics of Precarity. “The Trumpist wing of the Republicans isn’t just ascending – it’s the dominant wing of the Republican party. It’s the dominant wing not just in national politics, but in state and local politics as well,” said Lowndes. “The Republican party has committed itself to a party of minoritarian rule, figuring out ways to rule in the long term without having majority support of voters.” Gosar’s involvement with the January 6 Capitol insurrection has come under scrutiny from lawmakers. A House select committee investigating the deadly Capitol attack has been working for six months, in meetings mostly closed to the public, interviewing more than 300 witnesses and collecting more than 35,000 pages of records, according the Washington Post. Information has surfaced that link Gosar to one prominent Capitol riot organizer. A lawsuit filed by Alexander to block the release of his phone records, subpoenaed by the House committee, reveals testimony that discloses contacts with Republican members of Congress before the Capitol riot. The lawsuit states Alexander testified that he “had a few phone conversations” with Gosar and spoke to the Arizona congressman Andy Biggs “in person”. Lawmakers are debating whether sitting members of Congress can be subpoenaed to appear before the committee. Gosar also has longstanding links to far-right and white nationalist groups. Last year Gosar was the keynote speaker at an America First Political Action Conference (Afpac) organized by white nationalist Nick Fuentes, whom the Department of Justice in a court filing calls a “white supremacist” and who marched in the deadly Charlottesville “Unite the Right” rally. The January 6 committee is also seeking testimony from Fuentes, who has praised Gosar as supporting his agenda. “There is some hope, maybe, for America First in Congress, and that is thanks almost exclusively to representative Paul Gosar,” said Fuentes in a video message to his supporters last year. Gosar distanced himself from Fuentes after outcry over his appearance alongside the white nationalist in a promotion for a fundraising event. But he has also appeared to defend him. Gosar once tweeted: “Not sure why anyone is freaking out. I’ll say this: there are millions of Gen Z, Y and X conservatives. They believe in America First. They will not agree 100% on every issue. No group does. We will not let the left dictate our strategy, alliances and efforts. Ignore the left.” That was not the first time Gosar has incorporated white nationalist themes into his politics. Last year Gosar and the extremist Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene were linked to an “America First Caucus” that imploded in disarray after planning documents reported by Punchbowl News revealed language that included recruiting people based on “Anglo-Saxon political traditions”. Gosar was also censured and stripped of his committee posts late last year after tweeting a Photoshopped video of a violent anime sequence depicting him killing congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Biden. “I do not espouse violence towards anyone,” Gosar said during the House debate on his censure. “I voluntarily took the cartoon down, not because it was itself a threat, but because some thought it was. Out of compassion for those who genuinely felt offense, I self-censored.” But Gosar has a history posting of far-right content, including retweeting a QAnon conspiracy theory and a now-deleted tweet of a meme popular in white nationalists circles. Yet it is now in the area of election integrity that Gosar is becoming most prominent, helping to lead a charge across the US by Republicans claiming that elections in America are vulnerable to fraud and manipulation. “There’s a comfortable embrace of anti-democratic sentiment,” said Lowndes. “The Republican party hasn’t just opened the door to the far right, but it now relies on the far right.” At the Arizona rally Gosar told supporters to campaign locally on the election fraud issue. “Take it upon yourself that in your county you go to your county recorder and ask them what your ballot does. Make them walk you through it. That’ll tell them one thing: that you’re watching them. That you’re not going to let this happen, what happened in January of last year.” Gosar was among the Arizona Republican officials pushing for an audit of the election results of Maricopa county, the state’s most populous county. Before the Trump rally, the Maricopa elections department released a 93-page report rebuking each of the 76 claims about the 2020 elections made by elected Arizona Republican officials. The report found “the November 2020 General Election was administered with integrity and the results were accurate and reliable.” The report also found “despite all evidence to the contrary, false allegations continue to persist and damage voter confidence.” But there is at least one group of people close to Gosar who are not fooled – some of his own family. Three of Gosar’s siblings have publicly called for their brother to be expelled from Congress, the Arizona Republic has reported. “We know him to be an extremist and we took that very seriously,” his sister, Jennifer Gosar, told the newspaper. His brother, Dave Gosar, told NBC News: “I consider him a traitor to this country. I consider him a traitor to his family.” In the 2018 election six of Gosar’s nine siblings endorsed his opponent.",News/World news,‘The most dangerous man in Congress’: how Paul Gosar became a darling of the far right,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/paul-gosar-far-right-republicans
1/26/2022,"“Every day is different,” said Tim Davis, a concrete mixer truck driver in the Seattle, Washington, area. The work Davis and his coworkers do on a daily basis provides the foundation for every big construction and infrastructure project in the region, with long hours and varying start times every workday, leaving little time to spend with family. “We live in those trucks day in and day out,” Davis said.  He is one of 330 concrete mixer drivers and plant workers – represented by Teamsters Local 174 – who have been on a general strike over unfair labor practices, accusing their employers of refusing to negotiate in good faith. The striking workers fear employers want to purge unionized workers from the area’s construction industry and attempt to bankrupt the union through litigation. The strike is reverberating through the construction industry in and around Seattle, which has the second most construction cranes of any city in the US and has been leading the country’s construction boom since the pandemic hit. Hundreds of contractors have been laid off as construction projects have ground to a halt or been forced to reduce operations without concrete, and layoffs are expected to continue as the strike drags on. “The industry is moving forward and we’re falling behind,” added Davis. “The employers say they are family run, but I would never treat family like that. We were out on the picket lines through the holidays in the cold and there’s over 300 other guys out there. They all have families and their healthcare or medical is up this month. That affects 300 families and there are others now being laid off and that affects their families.” Some 34 dump truck drivers began striking on 19 November at Gary Merlino Construction, with about 100 workers joining the strike on 1 December. The remaining workers launched an industry wide strike on 4 December at six different employers that dominate the concrete industry in the Seattle area: Gary Merlino Construction, Stoneway Concrete, Cadman, CalPortland, Salmon Bay Sand & Gravel and Lehigh Cement. Workers unanimously voted in favor of authorizing the strike. The companies’ lead negotiator, president of Gary Merlino Construction Charlie Oliver, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. The workers’ contract expired on 31 July 2021, and they had worked without a contract for months before walking off the job in response to the stalled negotiations. “Since the contract expired, we’ve gotten nowhere. It’s actually gotten worse,” said Todd Parker, a concrete driver at Cadman Seattle and member of the bargaining committee. “What we’d like to see is what everybody else got this year. We just want to be treated as equally as everybody else and they’re not right now.” Workers have argued employers’ proposals for a new union contract included less compensation than other construction industry workers in the area receive, and would result in a decrease in compensation over the next three years, with inflation and the high cost of living in the area taken into account. The union has also claimed employers refuse to fund healthcare for retirees, even though the union offered to cover any cost increases. “For the last two years we have been deemed essential workers fighting through this pandemic. You think we’d be met with just a little bit of appreciation and gratitude, but that sure hasn’t been the case,” said Brett Gallagher, a concrete mix driver at CalPortland and bargaining committee member. Gallagher emphasized the pride he takes in his work, along with his coworkers, who get to see and help lay the foundation the rest of the building trades build upon. But he argued that concrete workers shouldn’t be treated with any less respect, as most of the office workers at their employers have been working from home throughout most of the pandemic. “We’re fighting for not just us, but for everybody else in these trades and everybody else in our communities,” added Gallagher. “A lot of us have families, some with young kids. I have three kids myself who depend on my medical insurance. I’ve got child support to pay and this is tough. It was tough to tell them that it was going to be a lean Christmas this year and they wonder why. It’s because a few people decided they don’t want to sit and talk to us like grownups.”",News/US news,Seattle’s cement workers strike over low wages and unfair labor practices,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/26/seattle-cement-industry-workers-strike-unfair-wages
1/26/2022,"The Royal Shakespeare Company is taking the innovative step of casting the people of England as the people of England in its new production of Henry VI Part 2 that will be performed at the company’s theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon this spring. Dozens of people with no theatrical background from six areas of the country will take part in the production, alongside a cast of professional actors.  All are involved in Shakespeare Nation, a community participation programme run by the RSC and partner theatres, aimed at reaching people who have little or no experience of theatre-going or Shakespeare’s plays. They have started rehearsing in theatres in Blackpool, Bradford, Canterbury, Cornwall, Norwich and Nottingham, and will join the RSC in Stratford when the production opens in April. The 74 adults will be joined by 21 youngsters aged 13-17 drawn from a network of schools that have an association with the RSC. They are youngsters with a talent for acting but from backgrounds that might restrict their chances of getting into the profession, the RSC said. The youngsters come from Barrow-in-Furness, Birmingham, Blackpool, Bradford, Canterbury, County Durham, Hull, Launceston, London, Middlesbrough, Northampton, Nottingham, Stoke-on-Trent and York. Shakespeare’s Henry VI trilogy tells the gripping and blood-drenched story of the brutal struggle for the English crown in the 15th century. The RSC has renamed part 2 as Henry VI: Rebellion. Its run will be followed by part 3, renamed Henry VI: Wars of the Roses. In the two productions, nine main parts will be reserved for actors that graduated from drama school last year, who have found launching their careers especially difficult when theatres and productions have been forced to close as a result of the Covid pandemic. Owen Horsley, who directs Rebellion and Wars of the Roses, said there were 85 characters on the cast list of Henry VI Part 2. “One of the reasons for this wide array of characters is a series of scenes that Shakespeare writes concerning the people of England, who in various ways interact with the royal family.” Horsley and Gregory Doran, co-director of Rebellion, had the idea of using the RSC’s outreach programme to cast ordinary people to play the people of England. Some scenes will see more than 50 people on the RSC stage. “This is an extremely exciting project as it allows this history play, written over 400 years ago, to respond directly to the state of the nation,” said Horsley. Kelly Harris, 23, from Bradford said she was “anxious and excited” about the prospect of taking to the RSC stage in a full-scale performance of Shakespeare. “At school I got really sick of Romeo and Juliet. But then I did Much Ado About Nothing for GCSE, and fell in love with it. I watched different Shakespeare productions on live streams, YouTube and the BBC – and then my mum sent me a link to the Shakespeare Nation project. I applied for it during lockdown for something to do.” Harris said she rarely went to the theatre. “Not many Shakespeare productions come to Bradford.” She has yet to find out what her part in Rebellion will be. “The play has a really good backstory, and there’s lots of gore and fighting. It’s right up my street.” In Rebellion, the nonprofessionals will play the roles of working people who take part in the uprising led by the character of Jack Cade against Henry VI, and townsfolk in a scene where Henry VI is out hunting. Some will have speaking parts.",Arts/Stage,RSC recruits amateurs from six regions as Shakespeare’s ‘people of England’,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/26/rsc-recruits-amateurs-from-six-regions-as-shakespeares-people-of-england
1/26/2022,"From menopause calendars to menopause scented candles, and menopause supplements to menopause spa breaks, there is no shortage of products to help ease a woman’s transition into her post-reproductive years. If you’re after something stronger, how about vaginal rejuvenation laser treatment or bioidentical oestrogen? You could even try to postpone menopause for a decade or so – provided you are willing to freeze a slice of your ovary in your 20s and then have it grafted back on in later life. Menopause is enjoying a moment. After centuries of enduring the rollercoaster of physical and emotional symptoms that often accompany it, middle-aged women have never been so well-catered for with products purporting to help. But is this sudden choice empowering, or just exploitative?  Half the world’s population will experience the menopause and, according to one recent report, the global menopause market represents a $600bn (£450bn) business opportunity. Dietary supplements, symptom-tracking apps, telemedicine and cosmetics represent some of the biggest investment prospects. “Women in this life stage continue to be sorely underserved,” says Adrianna Samaniego, an investor at the US venture capital company the Female Founders Fund (FFF), which produced the report. “And it’s not like the maternity experience where it’s nine months – this can last for 10 to 30 years.” But while medical experts are delighted that common symptoms such as night sweats, heavy bleeding, anxiety and low libido are being discussed more openly, and welcome the development of workplace programmes to better support women, some are concerned by the apparent menopause gold rush that is under way. “Overall, it is absolutely brilliant that so many more people are talking about menopause, but I think it’s getting too complicated, too medicalised, and too commercial,” says Dr Heather Currie, an associate specialist gynaecologist at Dumfries & Galloway NHS, and managing director of the menopausematters website. “When I was experiencing symptoms five years ago, I couldn’t get hormone replacement therapy (HRT) from my GP” says Dr Louise Newson, a GP, menopause specialist and founder of the Menopause Charity, who has set up a private menopause clinicI would have spent thousands on anything to save my job as a doctor, and to save my marriage, because I was really struggling.” Menopause occurs when a woman’s periods stop and her ovaries cease producing significant amounts of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone. This can occur naturally, due a diminishing number of eggs – usually between the ages of about 45 and 55 – or it can occur prematurely, if the ovaries are surgically removed, for example, or damaged by treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Oestrogen affects the body in many ways – from brain function, to bone density, skin elasticity, vaginal lubrication and the distribution of fat – so losing it causes our organs and tissues to behave differently. However, this transition does not occur overnight. Perimenopause refers to the time leading up to a woman’s last menstrual period. “During that time, women’s hormones are very variable,” says Dr Paula Briggs, a consultant in sexual and reproductive health at Liverpool Women’s NHS Foundation Trust and chair elect of the British Menopause Society. These fluctuating hormone levels underpin some of the symptoms women experience, such as heavy and/or irregular periods, heart palpitations or mood swings. As perimenopause progresses, women may experience other symptoms, such as hot flushes, night sweats, sleeplessness, skin irritation, anxiety or a reduced interest in sex – some of which may continue even after a woman stops having periods. “Very few women will get away without anything at all,” says Briggs. Post-menopause, hormone levels tend to be low and more stable, but this too can create problems. In the short term, falling oestrogen levels affect the part of the brain that controls body temperature, resulting in hot flushes and night sweats. Many women will experience vaginal dryness, itching, or pain during sex, which, left untreated, may increase the risk of recurrent urinary tract infections. Longer-term, low oestrogen affects the strength and density of bones, putting women at greater risk of osteoporosis, fractures and chronic pain. It may also cause changes that make women more vulnerable to heart disease and stroke. For centuries, many women suffered this transition in silence but, today, there are broadly two “camps”: those plumping for hormone replacement therapies (HRT) to alleviate their symptoms, and those seeking alternatives to hormone treatment. The history of HRT began in the early 1940s but it wasn’t until the 60s that the use of HRT became widespread. arious studies began to suggest that HRT might have other benefits, such as the prevention of osteoporosis or cardiovascular disease. This illusion was shattered in 2002, with the publication of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study, which found that HRT actually increased the risk of coronary heart disease and heart attacks, and also breast cancer and stroke – although the risk of colorectal or endometrial cancer and osteoporosis was reduced. The results triggered panic among many HRT users. “There was a 70% or greater decline in the use of prescription menopausal hormone therapy,” says Prof JoAnn Manson of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, US, a principal investigator on the WHI study since its inception in the early 90s. This sudden rejection of HRT left a large vacuum in terms of treatments for women. “Companies rushed in to fill the void,” says Manson. “They were not required to list the potential risks. They did not have to put a black box warning on compounded bioidentical hormone therapy, for example, or on these over-the-counter products that are untested for either safety or efficacy.” It does appear that some women benefit from taking such products. For instance, a 2016 review in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Jama) found that phytoestrogens (plant-based compounds that mimic the effects of oestrogen in the body), such as soy extracts or herbal remedies, including red clover and black cohosh, were associated with modest reductions in the frequency of hot flushes and vaginal dryness but produced no significant reduction in night sweats. “However, because of general suboptimal quality and the heterogeneous nature of the current evidence, further rigorous studies are needed,” its authors said. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) also states that black cohosh or St John’s wort may relieve hot flshes and night sweats. However, “the quality, purity, constituents, and safety” of complementary products “may be unknown, and different preparations may vary”, it said. “I think the assumption is that if you can buy something over the counter, it’s safe, but that’s not necessarily so – and you wouldn’t necessarily get the same level of consultation as if you spoke to a health professional,” says Briggs. “Black cohosh can be toxic to the liver, depending on the concentration, and St John’s wort is an enzyme-inducing drug, so it can interfere with other medications. Phytoestrogens like red clover are OK, but you wouldn’t take them if you’d had oestrogen-receptor positive breast cancer – because it could stimulate any residual cancer cells to grow.” Then there are compounded “bioidentical” hormone therapies beloved of celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey – plant-based preparations promoted as being identical to human hormones. Crafted into bespoke creams, lozenges or vaginal preparations by “specialist pharmacies” – often following costly blood or saliva hormone tests – they are sometimes painted as a natural or safer alternative to standard HRT. “These are not regulated, they’re not licensed, and they come under supplements, so they don’t have to follow the same standards as regulated hormones to be produced,” says Newson. Neither do you have to be a doctor to prescribe them . “I think a lot of it is a big marketing ploy, because people have been scared off HRT.” In their efforts to avoid conventional HRT, some women who are experiencing vaginal or bladder symptoms are resorting to expensive “laser vaginal rejuvenation” treatment. This involves creating “micro-abrasions” to stimulate the production of collagen and boost the blood supply. Although some studies have suggested that laser rejuvenation may help to alleviate some symptoms, the evidence for this is mixed: one study published in Jama in October found that so-called “fractional carbon dioxide laser treatment” may be no better than a placebo. There are also concerns that laser treatment could be harmful in some situations. In 2018, the FDA issued a statement warning about the possibility of burns and scarring as a result of it. Laser therapy may not be necessary. If over-the-counter lubricants and moisturisers don’t help, low-dose vaginal oestrogen delivered as a cream or pessary often proves an effective treatment. Because the hormone is released locally “it doesn’t raise the blood level of oestrogen above what is considered the normal menopausal range”, says Manson. “Local oestrogen is very effective and it’s safe for most women.” Evidence is also mounting that some of the fears about HRT may have been overblown. “Many of the risks [identified in the original studies] were driven by women who were more distant from the onset of menopause when they started hormone therapy – particularly women who were at least 70 years old when they were enrolled in the trial,” says Manson. “Women in their 50s tended to do quite well. They even had a signal for a lower risk of heart disease and all-cause mortality.” Also, the HRT formulations available today are different from what was available to those women enrolled in the WHI study. Alongside this, women are often given capsules of progestogen – similar to the progesterone that women naturally produce during their reproductive years – to counter the effects of oestrogen on the lining of the uterus and reduce the risk of cancer. HRT isn’t risk-free, but then no medical product is. Newson argues women should be allowed to take HRT for life if they want to. “Menopause is a hormone deficiency, but people have been scared away from their own hormones because of poor data, and because of scaremongering in the media and medical press,” she says. Because Newson runs a private menopause clinic she, arguably, has commercial skin in the game. She balks at this, pointing out that she channels some of the proceeds into her not-for-profit enterprises, such as the Menopause Charity and the balance menopause app. She claims she set up her private practice because women have often struggled to find help within the NHS, and “have nowhere else to go”. Also, because there aren’t enough dedicated menopause clinics for specialists like herself to secure NHS jobs. However, that’s starting to change. “For some women, it might depend on who they’ve seen,” says Currie. “To counteract that, there’s huge amount of education going on with the aim of women being able to get consistent advice wherever they are in the country.” If a woman’s GP isn’t helpful, she advises asking if anyone in the surgery has a special interest in menopause, or to be referred to one of the regional menopause specialist services that exist in many areas of the UK. HRT isn’t the only option, though, and with recent publicity around the benefits of HRT from celebrity advocates such as Davina McCall, some experts feel that the pendulum is now starting to swing too far in the opposite direction. “I’m now seeing women who often have significant health problems, who are being led to believe that HRT will miraculously cure them,” says Briggs. “Some of that is coming from celebrities who often have a very different lifestyle from the patients I’m dealing with.” She is anxious that the overprescribing of hormone therapies could trigger the same sort of crash as the publication of the WHI study did in 2002. She says: “I think there’s a lot of us who are feeling very uncomfortable – largely around very high [hormone] doses being used, lack of progestogens, testosterone by the shedload. Of course, HRT might be appropriate, but it might not be.” But pills and procedures are only part of the solution. “Menopause is a natural life stage for the majority of women, and it needs to be embraced and managed, rather than treated as a disease,” says Irene Aninye, director of science programmes at the Society for Women’s Health Research, which recently recommended preparing women early (as young as 35) for better health during the menopause transition and beyond. “This transition is different for everybody, and how your body responds to it is affected by your overall health and any specific conditions you may have,” Aninye says. A woman who is overweight or unfit is likely to gain more from healthy eating and exercise than taking hormones. Eating a healthy diet and taking regular exercise will also help guard against the longer term consequences of low oestrogen, such as cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. “What is needed,” says Briggs, “is a situation where menopause is talked about so that people know what’s likely to come, and they can make informed decisions about how they want to manage that part of their life.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,From vaginal laser treatment to spa breaks – it’s the great menopause gold rush,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/26/from-vaginal-laser-treatment-to-spa-breaks-its-the-great-menopause-gold-rush
1/26/2022,"Actor-turned-director Romola Garai makes her feature debut with this accomplished upscale British horror with touches of Eraserhead and Alien; it’s that particular kind of crepuscular indie chiller which you could call “body horror”, where the body in question is every single manky, mouldy surface and inanimate object. The film might not fully absorb all its images and ideas, and the dynamic between the male lead and two different female co-stars in the story’s “past” and “present” sections feels in some ways like a slightly redundant duplication. But it’s stylish and well-acted, and leads up to a surreal image of evil. Alec Secareanu plays Tomas, an ex-soldier from a central European war zone haunted by his memories. While in uniform, he had befriended a fugitive civilian called Miriam (Angeliki Papoulia) and in that field of conflict he had become guilty of violence and evil – symbolised by his unsettling discovery in the woodland of a pagan amulet buried in the soil, whose shell motif eerily recurs all around him. Now Tomas has made it to the UK as a refugee, carrying his anguish around with him, and twinkly-eyed nun Sister Claire (Imelda Staunton) appears to take pity on him, offering him a place to stay in a crumbling, derelict old house with Magda (a very good performance from Swiss actor Carla Juri), a young woman who lives there with an invalid mother dying, in agony, from some nameless disease in the topmost bedroom of the house.  Naturally we hear this woman’s unearthly screeches and groans, and we’re permitted increasingly explicit glimpses of her monstrous appearance. But there is something strange about Sister Claire, and it’s an enjoyably unsettling and startling performance from Staunton. Could it be that Garai has studied Kathleen Byron’s performance in the Powell/Pressburger classic Black Narcissus? Amulet is flawed, but it does a good job of alchemising drear into fear.  Amulet is released on 28 January in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Amulet review – Romola Garai makes directorial debut with smart upscale horror,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/26/amulet-review-romola-garai-makes-directorial-debut-with-smart-upscale-horror
1/26/2022,"Fifteen months after it was revealed that students could end up leaving school in England without studying a single piece of literature by a Black or minority ethnic author, research has found that teachers are still crying out for more diverse texts on the English syllabus. Asked which changes to the English syllabus they felt would most help their students, 80% of secondary school teachers, and 69% of primary school teachers, said they wanted more diverse and representative set texts. The survey of 2,270 teachers was made by Teacher Tapp for publisher Pearson.  The research follows the report last year that just 0.7% of GCSE students in England study a book by a writer of colour, compared with the 34.4% of school-age students in England who identify as Black, Asian or minority ethnic. The research was done by Penguin and race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust, which teamed up to form the campaign Lit in Colour to help support schools diversify the teaching of English literature. Although exam boards have since expanded their offerings, Lit in Colour found that lack of budget, and books, were key barriers facing those teachers looking to introduce new texts to their classes. In its first year, Lit in Colour offered resources and guidance to 119 GCSE and A-Level year groups around the country, and almost 12,000 students, in diversifying their English Literature curricula. Those participating received the four new texts introduced by Pearson to its A-Level and GCSE set texts – Les Blancs by Lorraine Hansberry, Sweat by Lynn Nottage, Home Fire by Kamila Shamsie and The Cutting Season by Attica Locke – as well as access to set texts ranging from Malorie Blackman’s Boys Don’t Cry to Alice Walker’s The Color Purple. The programme is now opening for a second year to schools looking to diversify their English literature offering. Programme manager Zaahida Nabagereka said Lit in Colour’s aim was “to normalise Black, Asian and minority ethnic writers within the literature curriculum by providing the necessary tools to teachers and students”. She added that, in its first year, the programme had received messages from librarians “who received their mini library donations excited to share the new books with students, but also from students saying they felt inspired after attending an author event”. At Westonbirt school, teacher Tabatha Sheehan said that children need a more diverse curriculum. “As a predominantly white, middle-class school out in the Cotswolds, we knew that we needed to better explore and fully acknowledge the wealth of talent that exists beyond the ‘canon’ of English literature and to move beyond the ‘intellectual’ prescriptivism and elitism in studying the linguistics, narratives and contexts of stories from other cultures,” she said. “We are more committed than ever to making the curriculum as representative as possible, to opening up our students’ minds to the world outside their neighbourhoods, and to ensuring that no young person feels excluded by the books we teach and read.”",Arts/Books,"Most English teachers want a more diverse syllabus, research finds",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/26/english-teachers-want-diverse-syllabus

The 49-year-old fisherman had been missing since the early hours of Saturday when he was thrown from a boat along with another man, aged 25, and a dog off North Harbour.  The younger man was rescued a few hours later, about 5am, after being spotted by a local fisherman in the water near Dobroyd Head. On Wednesday morning, police were called to Middle Harbour before 10am after two other fishermen located a body in the water near Washaway Bay in Clontarf. The body was recovered by the marine command and identified as the missing 49-year-old. A report will be prepared for the coroner, New South Wales police said in a statement. The 25-year-old was rescued on Saturday morning by surf lifesavers on jet skis and taken to Little Manly Beach where he told police his boat had flipped with his friend and a dog on board. The dog was found alive at nearby Cave Beach about 10.30am after the boat’s fuel tank and rubber mats were earlier recovered about 3.7km off the coast.
