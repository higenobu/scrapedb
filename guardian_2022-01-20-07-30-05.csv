1/20/2022,"Pepijn Lijnders, Liverpool’s assistant manager, has said Jürgen Klopp’s side have the “weapons” to hurt Arsenal and added incentive to reach the Carabao Cup final having felt written off after last week’s semi-final stalemate at Anfield. Liverpool were unable to capitalise on Granit Xhaka’s 24th-minute dismissal in the first leg and require a first League Cup win away at Arsenal in seven attempts to reach Wembley for the first time since 2016. The aftermath of the first leg, with Liverpool self-critical and Arsenal’s 10 men celebrating in front of their fans, will serve as motivation for Thursday’s return, insists Lijnders.  “I couldn’t wait for this game since the final whistle at Anfield because everyone was writing us off,” he said. “It was the disappointment of the stadium, the disappointment of the fans and the disappointment of us as a staff. It is not the outside world I am speaking about, it is the inside world. We need optimism in our squad because this semi-final is decided over two legs. It is half-time, it is 0-0 and there are no away goals. We proved already a lot of times that with a 0-0 at home, Bayern Munich for example, we can go there and do the things we do. “We are Liverpool Football Club and our team proved that we want to attack this competition and reach finals. A lot of people didn’t believe me when I said that before. We are here in the semi-final and can reach Wembley and we should try with everything we have to reach it. The journey for the fans to London to prepare a final, that is what this club is all about. As a player of Liverpool we won a lot but if you want to become a true legend you need to go for the national cups as well.” Klopp will be without Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané and Divock Origi, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who scored as a makeshift striker against Brentford on Sunday, is also absent. But Lijnders believes Liverpool have evolved as an attacking threat this season and have numerous ways to hurt Arsenal. “We knew, especially after last year, that we needed to create different weapons, create goals from everywhere, last passes from everywhere, dribbles from everywhere, attacks from everywhere, and not based on counterattack or just the speed of these two boys [Mané and Salah],” he said. “They are our face, our front line, they give us so much direction in our game. What I like is we don’t have one weapon, we have so many ways to attack, and how we are evolving as a team and how we are developing with our positional game is important.”",Sport/Football,Lijnders insists Liverpool have ‘weapons’ to beat Arsenal in second leg,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/19/lijnders-insists-liverpool-have-weapons-to-beat-arsenal-in-second-leg
1/20/2022,"Steven Bergwijn, fortunate only to have been booked for shoving Caglar Soyuncu as this game entered injury time with Leicester City winning 2-1, scored the two goals in stoppage time that enabled Tottenham Hotspur to climb to fifth place in the Premier League. The Dutch winger, strongly linked with a possible move to Ajax, only came on in the 79th minute as Antonio Conte sought to extend his unbeaten league start as Spurs manager to nine games.  His frustration seemed to boil over as, having fallen easily to the ground seeking an unlikely penalty, he reacted angrily to Soyuncu telling him to get up. Instead Bergwijn sent Spurs fans into delirium as he equalized when Matt Doherty’s run into the area saw the ball fall off Soyuncu’s chest for the £25m winger to slot home. Then, when Youri Tielemans sloppily gave the ball away from kick-off, Harry Kane sent Bergwijn through the middle to round Kasper Schmeichel and shoot past Soyuncu on the line and in off the far post. Bergwijn hurdled the hoardings to celebrate with the Spurs fans and, when the final whistle on a crazy game blew seconds later, it was Kane who led the impassioned partying with the visiting crowd. Neither team had kicked a Premier League ball since New Year’s Day or before but amidst all the Covid cases, cup games and cacophony over postponements, Spurs had burst out of the traps with all the zest usually accompanying a new season. Despite Leicester somehow taking the lead through Patson Daka midway through the first half, Kane’s equaliser seven minutes before the break against his favourite opponents was among his seven attempts on goal in a topsy-turvy 45 minutes. Kane has 18 goals in 17 games against Leicester, the team for whom he scored twice in 13 Championship games while on loan here in 2012/13. But it was the spring in his step, the lack of rust, that was most gratifying for Spurs fans, and, in this World Cup year, those of England. Whether it was from the freshness or frustration of not playing the North London derby last Sunday when Arsenal had successfully appealed for the game to be called off by the Premier League for a shortage of players, Spurs belied the defensive-looking nature of their lineup to launch themselves at Leicester in the early stages. Kane, in the ninth minute, beat James Maddison, Hamza Choudhury and Soyuncu in the tightest of spaces down the inside-left channel of the penalty area before shooting past Schmeichel only for Luke Thomas to cleverly clear the ball off the line with his heel. Then Kane thudded a header from Harry Winks’ corner against the crossbar in the 18th minute as Spurs looked to move level on points with West Ham United in fourth place. Lucas Moura had a right-footed blast parried behind by Schmiechel while Davinson Sanchez headed wide from Sergio Reguilón’s right-wing cross. It seemed only a matter of time before Spurs took the lead despite their fans taking to Twitter beforehand to bemoan a midfield of Winks, Oliver Skipp and Pierre-Emile Højbjerg ostensibly sitting in front of a back five. Leicester, lest it be forgotten, have also had their selection issues and, while they had James Justin back in the squad for the first time in 11 months after his ACL injury, they were still missing seven players who would all count themselves first-choice players. In the continued absence of Jamie Vardy, Daka has been asked to lead the line and he was on hand to finish neatly in the 24th minute from Leicester’s first attempt at goal. This mirrored their win over Liverpool in their last league game, so few Foxes fans were complaining. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall made good progress down the left wing before Ademola Lookman burst onto his pass inside, via a touch off Daka, and Reguilón threw his hands towards his face as he realised his interception was falling back into the path of the Zambian, whose shot went in off the near post for his eighth goal in all competitions. Leicester’s tails briefly lifted, Maddison’s superb effort being tipped aside by Hugo Lloris, as this game started to swing from end to end like some crazy playground finale when the teacher has rung the bell for class. Trouble was, there was still an hour left to play. Spurs finally got their equaliser when Jannik Vestergaard’s loose pass was intercepted by Skipp and Winks immediately, intelligently, played the ball into the inside-right channel the Danish defender had vacated. There Kane scurried before cutting back inside Soyuncu and slotting home his fourth goal of the season in off the far post. With each team fielding three central defenders, but dropping to a 5-3-2 out of possession, and both playing a winger alongside their No9 up front, there could have been a prospect of a defensive stalemate. No fear: you attack, we attack; we’re as good as you, you’re as bad as us. It looked like Leicester had won it 14 minutes from time. Brendan Rodgers has had a tougher ride than usual from the Leicester City faithful during this bewildering winter but, within a minute of introducing Harvey Barnes late on, the Leicester manager was celebrating as his substitute made the goal for Maddison. Maddison netted at the culmination of a sweet move in which he spun Tielemans’ pass round the corner and ran on to a clever return from Barnes before scoring via a deflection off Japhet Tanganga. But this crazy game still had a crazy finish to come.",Sport/Football,Bergwijn’s injury-time double snatches Tottenham stunning win at Leicester,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/19/leicester-spurs-premier-league-match-report
1/20/2022,"English club rugby is set to return to free-to-air television following the agreement of a new deal with ITV. At the start of this season there was widespread disappointment when the popular Channel 5 highlights show was axed but Premiership Rugby has now negotiated a fresh partnership with ITV until the end of the 2023-24 season. There is a catch for viewers hoping to see full games on ITV every weekend, with the deal involving a mere four live matches this season plus the final on ITV4. Premiership officials, though, are delighted that their grand finale, for the first time in the competition’s history, will be shown on live free-to-air TV in tandem with BT Sport’s well-regarded coverage.  In each of the next two seasons, however, seven games including the final will be aired by ITV, organisers having apparently accepted that the abrupt disappearance of the sport from Channel 5 was a mistake which needed rectifying. It was the first time for 14 years that Premiership rugby had not been available on terrestrial television, with Craig Doyle and Martin Bayfield having presented their first ITV highlights show in 2007. The new weekly highlights show on ITV4 will now be fronted by David Flatman and Topsy Ojo. Premiership Rugby’s new chief executive Simon Massie-Taylor hailed the deal as “great news for the league, our clubs, the supporters and the profile of rugby in England” and now hopes it will prove a springboard towards more widespread interest in the sport “Our ambition is to grow the game and make Gallagher Premiership Rugby available to as many people as possible,” said Massie-Taylor. “BT Sport have done an amazing job in building the core Premiership Rugby TV audience and the ITV partnership allows us to expand our reach into the households of millions of other rugby fans. This season our average match audience on BT Sport has risen 30% year on year, which shows the potential.” Last season’s final between Harlequins and Exeter Chiefs was among Twickenham’s most enthralling days and Massie-Taylor is seeking to make the 2022 final the most-watched fixture in the tournament’s history. “We believe we can achieve that with the match screened on both ITV4 and BT Sport,” he added. “It is also crucial for us to have a weekly highlights programme that is accessible to millions of people. This will allow us to showcase the best of Gallagher Premiership rugby to the widest possible audience.” ITV’s first live game will see Sale Sharks playing host to the Premiership pacesetters Leicester Tigers on 30 January.",Sport/Sport,"ITV agree deal to show Premiership rugby, including live final",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/19/itv-agree-deal-to-show-premiership-rugby-including-live-final
1/20/2022,"Marc Skinner praised the “spirit and togetherness” of Manchester United after Alessia Russo’s fine header late on in a fiery encounter with Arsenal took his team into the semi-finals of the Continental League Cup. “I’m so proud of everyone and all the staff. They’ve worked tirelessly. But we’ve done nothing but get to a semi-final, we’ve got work to do,” he cautioned.  “We’ve beaten Arsenal but if you make that your mantle then you don’t ever grow because you’re only ever chasing teams. We have to focus on what we can do and how good we can be and see past the ceilings that people give us.” Arsenal had introduced a clutch of new signings and returning players to swing momentum the home side’s way after a cagey opening half but were made to suffer a fifth defeat in six games after Russo rose highest from a free-kick in the 85th minute. Arsenal have been on the ropes since the start of December. The Gunners’ sole match of 2022 prior to this – thanks to last Sunday’s game against Reading being postponed at the request of the Royals due to Covid and injuries – was a shock 2-0 defeat to the then bottom-placed Birmingham. Jonas Eidevall absorbed the blame for that disjointed performance but at a bitterly cold Borehamwood his side looked far more organised and he was somewhat surprisingly bright afterwards because of it. “Today was a big step in the right direction, and that’s where your focus needs to be, on your own performances,” he said. “We need to build on that, and attack the next game against Manchester City.” Boosted by the return from injury of Leah Williamson, who signed a new contract with her childhood club last week, and the USA forward Tobin Heath, who both made the bench, the home team matched the high press of the dynamic United. Also seated in the dugout were two of Arsenal’s three January recruits: the Sweden forward Stina Blackstenius and Austrian defender Laura Wienroither – the former a target of their opponents before their move was hijacked. United may have just one win in five meetings with Arsenal, but the games have always been tight. Skinner’s team had won four games back-to-back in all competitions prior to their trip to London without conceding, with Saturday’s 5-0 defeat of Birmingham prompting the manager to say the team is now “moving in the direction we want to be in”. In the second half tensions flared. A high foot from Martha Thomas on Beth Mead right in front of the Arsenal dugout prompted Eidevall to rage on the edge of his technical area while Thomas stared him down and United players swarmed round the irate manager. Both Thomas and Eidevall were booked for the confrontation. Shortly afterwards a late challenge from Ivana Fuso clipped Katie McCabe’s foot from underneath her much to the fury of the Arsenal fans nearby. In a bid to shore things up Eidevall sent on Williamson and made a triple change not long after, with Tobin Heath, Wienroither and Blackstenius all thrown on. The impact was instant and Arsenal poured forward in search of a winner but struggled to find a clean shot on goal, while United continued to threaten on the counterattack. It was as a result of a quick break that they scored. The substitute Russo outstripped the Arsenal defence, and Jen Beattie lunged in, conceding a free-kick on the right. United’s captain, Katie Zelem, sent the ball in and Russo rose above Beattie to head powerfully in at the back post in front of a rapturous away contingent.",Sport/Football,Manchester United’s Alessia Russo ends Arsenal hopes in Women’s League Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/19/arsenal-manchester-united-womens-league-cup-quarter-final-match-report
1/20/2022,"Not for the first time and almost certainly not for the last, this mercurial bunch of Manchester United players served up a night’s work that defied cogent analysis. They should have been buried by Brentford in the first half but turned up for the second and pulled clear with exceptionally-worked goals from Anthony Elanga, Mason Greenwood and the substitute Marcus Rashford. Some of their speed and slickness after the break bore the hallmarks of Ralf Rangnick, who will be delighted by the eventual shift in gear. Ivan Toney’s late consolation was the least his side deserved and Brentford will rue a number of missed chances. Brentford would like Christian Eriksen to help add guile to their customarily high-octane approach but their existing forces proved more than capable of asking questions. They pegged United back in the early exchanges, a booming long throw from Mads Bech Sørensen setting the tone, and Mathias Jensen could have done better than snatch a volley harmlessly wide after a clearance sat up for him on the edge of the area.  Rangnick had kept faith with Elanga, who was bright in the wasteful draw at Aston Villa, while reintroducing the newly-available Cristiano Ronaldo and Scott McTominay. When Elanga found several yards of space beyond the far post and looped a header across goal, the league debutant Jonas Lössl’s uncertain punch forced rapid evasive action from Sergi Canós as attackers lurked. That was scratchy defending, but United soon topped it in a chaotic spell that saw Brentford come close four times in two minutes. When a loose pass at the back allowed Christian Nørgaard to send Jensen away, the angle favoured the home midfielder rather than David de Gea. But the finish was tame and De Gea could save with a foot; the ball stayed live and, as bodies piled into the box, Vitaly Janelt’s shot was deflected narrowly off target. Almost immediately afterwards, shambolic attempts to deal with a Brentford corner allowed Sørensen a snap shot that looked goalbound until Alex Telles, who knew little about his intervention, snicked it behind. Brentford were not done: the whirlwind of pressure ended with Nørgaard blazing over after Jensen’s knockback and, much like his compatriot moments previously, could curse himself for not opening the scoring. United should have been behind. As proceedings took a consistent shape they dominated the ball but rarely caused Brentford, who were willing to sit deep in the safe knowledge that they could wreak havoc on the counter, any flutters. Diogo Dalot shot wide with a respectable effort from distance but, whenever Brentford broke, the visitors’ shape was all over the place. In the 33rd minute the point was made again when Ivan Toney pulled out to the left and, with three forwards faced by a single defender, could offer Jensen the chance to make amends. The midfielder was through again but, as with his earlier chance, opted against putting his foot through the ball. He went for precision and, in an identical sequence, De Gea repelled with his left leg. The half had passed United by, although they forced a late corner when Elanga fleetingly got away on the left. Rangnick cannot be expected to coax a sustained breakneck tempo out of his charges in a mere period of months but the difference in the sides’ intensities was stark. It is not a new theme, but it can quickly be patched over by one of United’s disparate individuals. Two minutes after the interval Ronaldo almost did what he so often does, meeting Bruno Fernandes’ chipped cross and heading onto the bar with Lössl nowhere. A corner resulted and Brentford sprung upfield with Jensen yet again the player in space. From the most difficult of his opportunities, he shot straight at De Gea. There was a sense of inevitability that Brentford would regret his wastefulness. United’s passing had exuded a mite more purpose since half-time and it was a ball of supreme, if uncharacteristic, ingenuity that carved the Bees open. Fred took their back line out with a clipped, deftly angled ball from deep that found Elanga making an equally intelligent run into the box. His first touch controlled the ball and, with Lössl offering little challenge as it sat up, his second was a purposeful header into the corner. The complexion had changed for good. Brentford attempted to rally but could not regain their elasticity. Lössl bundled a McTominay shot behind and a quick second goal appeared likely. It came after a chested pass from Ronaldo sent Fernandes running clear and Greenwood, hitherto invisible, profited from an unselfish pass across. United had shown their opponents how to be lethal on the counter and another lesson followed. Rashford had recently replaced Greenwood and scored his first goal since 30 October with conviction after excellent work from McTominay had let Fernandes tee him up. Toney’s bundled late effort meant little.",Sport/Football,Anthony Elanga puts Manchester United on path to win at Brentford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/19/brentford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report
1/20/2022,"Hundreds of heavily armed police have stormed one of Rio’s largest favelas at the start of what authorities claimed was a “transformational” bid to wrest back control from the drug gangs and paramilitary mafias which dominate huge swaths of the Brazilian city. The operation began at daybreak on Wednesday as security forces in camouflage gear and armoured personnel carriers swept into Jacarezinho, a bustling redbrick community that has been a stronghold of the Red Command drug faction since the 1980s.  One burly special forces soldier sported a Latin adage on a tactical vest stuffed with high-caliber ammunition. “Si vis pacem, para bellum,” it said. “If you want peace, prepare for war.” Hours later police said 30 arrests were made as troops targeted Muzema, a much smaller favela controlled by the “milícia” mafia groups that many now consider a far greater threat than Rio’s drug factions. “Today’s operations are merely the start of changes that go far beyond public security,” tweeted Rio’s conservative governor, Cláudio Castro, an ally of the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who once publicly called for the milícias to be legalized. Civil police chief Allan Turnowski said a permanent police occupation would follow Wednesday’s raid on Jacarezinho, which last year was the scene of the worst police massacre in Rio history. “This will work out. Good always defeats evil,” Turnowski wrote on Instagram. Other communities will reportedly be occupied in the coming days. Critics and specialists doubt the new wave of occupations will do anything to resolve the decades-long drug conflict that continues to claim hundreds of mostly young, black lives each year.A high-profile “pacification” project, launched before Brazil’s 2014 World Cup and Rio’s 2016 Olympics, was initially hailed as a success but failed to permanently evict traffickers from the favelas, while milícias have massively expanded their footprint over the last decade and now control more than 50% of the city. Pablo Nunes, a public security expert from Rio’s Centre for Studies on Public Security and Citizenship, voiced skepticism over the claim from Rio’s governor that this week’s operations – which caught specialists by surprise – represented the start of “a major process of transformation” in the favelas. “The favelas and outskirts of Rio have never been transformed by the barrel of a gun,” said Nunes, who suspected the initiative was simply a political ploy to help a politically weak governor secure a second term in office later this year. “This is a very well-known script,” Nunes said of the political use of public security policy in Rio, with little if any thought given to the people and communities affected or the long-term impact on crime. Ivan Blaz, the spokesperson for Rio’s military police, pushed back against such doubts, claiming authorities were determined to combat drug traffickers and the “rule of terror” imposed by milícias, who he admitted enjoyed the support of serving or former members of the security forces. “I understand [some people] feel they have seen this film before … but it’s my duty to not accept this,” Blaz said as a helicopter swooped over streets long controlled by rifle-toting gang members. “Optimism is part of my uniform.” Leandro Souza, a community leader in Jacarezinho, said he hoped the military occupation would be accompanied by job-creation and training schemes and social projects that could lift a profoundly deprived community flanked by abandoned factories. “If they manage this … it will be a huge step forwards like never seen before,” he said. “I hope this is not simply another botched attempt at ‘pacification’ that leads to bloodshed and claims the lives of residents, police officers and even those involved in drug trafficking.”",News/World news,Heavily armed police launch huge push to seize control of Rio de Janeiro favela,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/hundreds-of-armed-police-storm-rio-de-janeiro-favela
1/20/2022,"It looks like Ivanka Trump is finally coming out of stealth mode. Ever since her father lost his job as president and she lost her job as special advisor to the president, Ivanka has been keeping a low profile in Miami and largely staying off social media. On Tuesday, however, the former first daughter posted on Instagram and Twitter for the first time in eight months, showing off photos of herself distributing free food boxes to families upstate New York.  It was very good of Ivanka to take time out to volunteer, as she has quite a bit on her plate at the moment. On the same day that Trump chose to break her social media silence, New York attorney general Letitia James dramatically turned up the heat on her ongoing investigation into the Trump Organization. In court papers filed on Tuesday, James accused the Trump Organization and Donald Trump of inflating the value of their assets to secure preferential loans and other economic benefits. The Trump Organization has released a statement calling James’s allegations “baseless”. It’s not just the former president who is in hot water; the court filings also note that the investigation had uncovered incriminating information about Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka. A snippet from these allegations: “Until January 2017, Ms. Trump was a primary contact for the Trump Organization’s largest lender, Deutsche Bank. In connection with this work, Ms. Trump caused misleading financial statements to be submitted to Deutsche Bank and the federal government.” To be clear: this is all still just an inquiry. If James finds enough evidence of wrongdoing, she can then decide to file a civil lawsuit. (Meanwhile, the Trump Organization is also under criminal investigation for tax fraud and there are various other lawsuits related to sexual assault allegations, inheritance, and whether Trump should be held personally liable for inciting the January 6 insurrection.) And the Trump family isn’t just facing a flurry of lawsuits, they’re busy filing their own: last month the former president sued James in an attempt to stop her inquiry into his business practices on the grounds of political bias. Trump’s lawyers have also tried to block James from questioning Trump and his children under oath. (Although it should be noted that Eric Trump, executive vice-president at the Trump Organization, was questioned in October 2020. He reportedly invoked the Fifth Amendment more than 500 times.) The motions filed on Tuesday were to try and compel Trump and the kids to appear in sworn testimony. In short, you can see why Ivanka – who has always managed her personal brand a lot more carefully than her blowhard brothers have – might decide now would be a good time to post photos online of her benevolently helping the poor. Particularly as Ivanka wasn’t just showing off her ability to haul boxes of apples in the snow, she was also calling out the fact that she’d teamed up with Chobani founder Hamdi Ulukaya for the initiative. Ulukaya is something of a liberal darling; he’s a Turkish immigrant who has pledged much of his vast personal fortune to the Tent Partnership for Refugees, a charity he founded. He is one of the last people one might expect to align his brand with the Trumps. Still, it seems he and Ivanka are on chummy terms. Ivanka told the New York Post that the food drive “really evolved out of a discussion Hamdi and I had over lunch one day as the holidays were approaching and the dollar is going less far due to inflation”. Ivanka may have helped fill a few stomachs last week but does she have any hope of changing hearts and minds? Can she regain the standing she once had amongst liberals? Ivanka’s food photoshoot hasn’t been the only form of image management she’s been engaged in recently. She also seems to have been subtly distancing herself from her father. She didn’t attend his rally in Arizona last weekend and there have been various “leaked” reports lately that Trump’s reports that about the “stolen” 2020 election were driving Ivanka and Jared Kushner away. Mary Trump, Donald’s estranged niece, has previously opined that she believes the former president’s adult children could very well sacrifice their father to save themselves. If that happens, I think I know who’ll be first in line to dob in dad. And, if all else fails, and Ivanka can’t fix her tarnished brand with food deliveries, she can always follow the lead of former White House aide, Hope Hicks, and join Celebrity Big Brother.",Opinion/Opinion,It will take more than charity food boxes to fix Ivanka Trump’s tarnished brand | Arwa Mahdawi,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/19/it-will-take-more-than-charity-food-boxes-to-fix-ivanka-trumps-tarnished-brand
