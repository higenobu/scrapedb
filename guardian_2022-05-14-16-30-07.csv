5/14/2022,"As you read this, I will be packing my tuxedo, linen shirts and several packets of ibuprofen for the Cannes film festival, which kicks off on Tuesday – back where it belongs in the calendar, in the springy blush of May. At last year’s pandemic-delayed July edition, a wildcard Palme d’Or win for Julia Ducournau’s genderqueer cars-and-carnality freakout Titane seemed an apt response to the humid conditions. For viewers at home, Mubi’s Cannes takeover season offers some highlights from festivals past, from little-seen finds such as Mauritanian director Med Hondo’s powerful 1967 immigrant portrait Oh, Sun to more recent successes such as Laurent Cantet’s impassioned schoolroom debate The Class. Three of Mubi’s selections are from last year’s festivals, not yet seen in the UK: Arnaud Desplechin’s airless Philip Roth adaptation Deception was a disappointment, but Nadav Lapid’s jury prize winner Ahed’s Knee is exhilarating stuff, a scorching, incensed attack on what it perceives as the cultural complacency of contemporary Israel. A more gentle must-see is Mariner of the Mountains, Brazilian director Karim Aïnouz’s wistful, lyrical documentary on his own mixed heritage and sense of not-belonging, tracing his first ever trip to his father’s homeland of Algeria in his mid-50s. I, meanwhile, am preparing by revisiting the oeuvre of David Cronenberg, the 79-year-old Canadian master of the perverse and the perverted, who will return to Cannes with Crimes of the Future, his first film in eight years. More significantly still, it’s his return to body horror – the genre that made his name, but one he hasn’t fully embraced since 1999’s eXistenZ. I began with the obvious precedent for Crimes of the Future: Cronenberg’s lo-fi, hour-long 1970 feature of exactly the same name (Arrow Player), though we’ve been told not to expect a remake. Often bracketed with his similarly brief, scrappy film Stereo (Amazon Prime), it set the template for a number of the film-maker’s great works, preoccupied as it is with irresponsible medical fetishism, masculinity in crisis and the human body turning villainously on itself. The 1970s would see him extending those fixations into neater, sharper horror narratives. Shivers (Apple TV) fuses the terrors of parasite and sexual assault into one horrific pandemic, while Rabid (BFI Player) and The Brood (Amazon) both reconfigure the female body as a weapon; in the latter, the womb is literally externalised, reproducing manifestations of rage. Videodrome (Google Play) spent the director’s highest budget to date on a deliciously gross allegory for the media’s technological control of the human mindset; The Fly (Disney+, inappropriately enough) finally got Cronenberg a hit, though its relatively straightforward update of a hoary mad-scientist story didn’t skimp on invasive grotesquerie. Dead Ringers (BFI Player), my favourite Cronenberg, played things cooler, returning to themes of toxic masculinity and feminine exploitation with a surgical touch and an icily precise dual turn by Jeremy Irons. It played down the stomach-churning spectacle, but was the director’s most disturbing film until the hotly controversial Crash (Arrow Player), with its eye-searing imagery and darkly entangled queries about the boundaries of human desire and arousal, came along. In adapting JG Ballard, Cronenberg found a lither literary parallel for his most dangerous fixations than William Burroughs: his adaptation of the writer’s Naked Lunch (Arrow Player) looks sensational, but feels, unusually for Cronenberg, all up in its own head. Since the loopy but less enduring video-game pyrotechnics of eXistenZ (Amazon), Cronenberg has been flirting with greater genre respectability, from the lean suburban noir A History of Violence (Google Play) to the corset-clad mind games of his Freud-Jung biopic A Dangerous Method (Curzon). There’s merit in all these experiments, but ultimately good taste isn’t Cronenberg’s sweet spot: bring on the retching. Marry Me(Universal)It’s odd that, despite maintaining a dual career as a film and pop star for more than 20 years, Jennifer Lopez hasn’t done much singing on screen – until this agreeably silly romcom, in which she plays a reasonable facsimile of her glamazon self, improbably matched with Owen Wilson’s dorky schoolteacher. The onscreen romance is somewhat thwarted by the stars’ lack of sizzle as a pair, but the high-camp musical numbers are terrific. Dog(Entertainment)The return of Channing Tatum to starring roles has been one of the year’s most welcome developments in film. Not just resting on his hunk-with-a-heart charisma, he makes a credible directing debut in this bittersweet road comedy about a former army ranger and a military working dog healing their PTSD together. It’s wholesomely corny in some respects, but with an interestingly ambiguous political undertow. Parallel Mothers(Warner Bros)Pedro Almodóvar and Penélope Cruz reaffirm their status as one of modern cinema’s great director-actor unions with this ripe, heady melodrama, which somehow deftly marries plot points filched from a thousand soap operas to a thoughtful, stirring reflection on civil war loss and legacy. Cruz’s richly emotive, Oscar-nominated performance stitches it all together. ’Round Midnight(Sony)A few weeks ago I spotlit a fine box set dedicated to the recently late French master Bertrand Tavernier. Not included was this smoky, elegiac jazzman character study from 1986, starring the great American saxophonist Dexter Gordon in a poignant, self-referential turn, and boasting a brilliant Herbie Hancock score. Now, though, it gets the sleek Criterion Collection treatment.",Arts/Film,Streaming: the best David Cronenberg films,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/14/streaming-the-best-david-cronenberg-films-return-to-cannes-crimes-of-the-future-mubi-cannes-takeover
5/14/2022,"Almost three months have passed since Thomas Tuchel’s job description changed. Previously he was the head coach. His role was to look after Chelsea’s first team, win some trophies and steer clear of controversy. Overall, despite the odd stumble here, the odd unauthorised interview from Romelu Lukaku there, life was good. Chelsea were an undisputed member of the elite and, after escaping the infighting and egos at Paris Saint-Germain, Tuchel appreciated being left to do what he loves most: coach his team and concentrate on the football. But then, as Chelsea prepared to face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final at the end of February, the mood shifted. The Russian invasion of Ukraine was under way which put Roman Abramovich in an awkward position. Suddenly, Tuchel was fielding questions about Abramovich’s future at Chelsea. Incredibly, he was prepared to answer them. “You’re right,” Tuchel said, responding to a question about Abramovich being accused in parliament of having links to the Russian state. “We should not pretend this is not an issue.” It was something of an understatement from Chelsea’s manager. The news cycle soon became relentless. It felt irrelevant when Tuchel brought on Kepa Arrizabalaga for penalties against Liverpool and the Spanish goalkeeper sent the decisive spot-kick into orbit. Football was an afterthought. Nobody was asking Tuchel about his team. How could they when confirmation that Abramovich was selling the club came 69 minutes before Chelsea were due to face Luton in the fifth round of the FA Cup on 2 March? Or when the UK government imposed sanctions on the Russian oligarch on the morning of Chelsea’s trip to Norwich on 10 March? “I am not a politician,” Tuchel had said, his patience understandably stretched by the repeated questions about war, but now he was the public face of a frozen asset. The Chelsea hierarchy mostly stayed quiet. There was a television interview with Petr Cech, the club’s technical and performance adviser, but nothing from key figures such as Marina Granovskaia and Bruce Buck, both of whom are close to Abramovich. Instead the responsibility fell on Tuchel to speak about an unprecedented situation during press conferences. Any knocks, Thomas? Any thoughts on Timo Werner’s search for goals? And while we’ve got you, any idea how long until Mr Abramovich finds a buyer? It has been dizzying. Chelsea are back at Wembley on Saturday afternoon, hoping for revenge against Liverpool in the FA Cup final, but their heads are spinning. The uncertainty has weighed heavily on them and, as Tuchel puts it, they are desperate for an injection of “positive energy” that confirmation of Todd Boehly’s consortium buying the club will bring. The sense of drift has been difficult to hold off. Operating under a special licence has taken a toll. The sight of empty seats at Stamford Bridge in recent weeks has been jarring, with Chelsea unable to sell tickets for home games, and performances have merely served to deepen the gloom. Perhaps a lack of motivation was to be expected. Chelsea are unable to sell or buy players and they cannot hand out new contracts. It is not a surprise that the dressing room is unsettled. The club has inevitably felt directionless and Tuchel was not exactly spilling state secrets when he admitted that Antonio Rüdiger’s and Andreas Christensen’s impending departures on free transfers have had a negative impact. Losing Rüdiger to Real Madrid is a huge blow. The commanding centre-back’s teammates are not happy about Chelsea’s failure to keep him, and Christensen will leave a further hole in central defence when he joins Barcelona, who are also targeting César Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso. The situation is far from ideal. Tuchel has mostly exuded dignity, charm and intelligence but even he has struggled at times. He has despaired at Chelsea’s defensive solidity disappearing and the individual errors piling up. He has grasped for solutions to his side’s indifferent home form. There was the long night of chocolate as Tuchel pored over clips of Chelsea’s defeat in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final to Madrid. A week later he came up with a superb gameplan at the Bernabéu, only to be undone by Karim Benzema and Luka Modric. It has been one thing after another. But for all the whispers about Tuchel leaving, it is not for show when he says that he loves his job. He wants Cech and Granovskaia to stay but is excited about working under new owners. What Tuchel needs now is backing as he tries to turn Chelsea into title contenders. The challenge for Boehly and his partners will be to trust their manager. Tuchel will be their biggest asset. He performed wonders by winning the Champions League last year, has won the European Super Cup and Club World Cup this season, and has exuded authority over the past three months, a voice of calm and reason throughout the most unsettling period in Chelsea’s history. Tuchel has been the guiding light. His value to Chelsea, who are close to clinching Champions League qualification, has never been clearer. Normality is returning, Lukaku is scoring and the most immediate task is to find a way past Liverpool. Tuchel, who will soon be back to focusing solely on football, will surely have a plan as Chelsea look to close out the Abramovich era with one last trophy. He will know that this strangest of seasons could yet end on a high.",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel stays calm amid the chaos as Chelsea’s biggest asset,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/14/thomas-tuchel-stays-calm-amid-the-chaos-as-chelseas-biggest-asset
5/14/2022,"In 2018, architects Sonya Flynn and Mark Baker had just finished remodelling a large, 1970s house on a north Kent seafront for a client when a smaller house down the road came on the market. During the project, they had fallen in love with the location: the shingle beach, the uninterrupted sea views and spectacular, year-round sunsets. The unprepossessing 1950s semi in Tankerton, Whitstable, hadn’t been touched for 25 years. The couple, who run architecture studio Meme, thought they could create a similar home for their own family, only on a smaller budget. But Red Sands (the house is named after a cluster of sea forts built at the mouth of the Thames estuary during the second world war but now abandoned) went to a higher bidder. A few months later, Flynn and Baker were about to exchange on a similar property further from the sea when the agents called and offered them a second chance. The deal went through and the young family moved in. The house is now unrecognisable from the dilapidated two-bed they bought four years ago. Partly inspired by beach houses in Melbourne, it is clad in a combination of larch and shou sugi ban (charred timber), with generous glazing to make the most of its relationship with the sea. “We follow the work of a few Melbourne and Sydney practices,” Flynn says. “We were inspired by their use of material and texture, as well as how their houses relate to the beach. We wanted the frontage and landscaping to feel open and relaxed. In the past, houses on this coast would not have been quite so open to the sea views because of the weather, but we are better equipped for that technically these days, so it felt important to make the most of them.” As well as keeping vestiges of the old house (a deep-green snug at the front, for example), the couple have created bright and bold new spaces from exposed concrete blocks and jumbo terrazzo tiles. Bespoke, oak-veneered joinery sits alongside contemporary artwork. Every inch has been made into something either fun or functional. As soon as they moved in, Flynn, who grew up in Sligo, took the couple’s two children, Hannah, 10, and Hugo, eight, to Ireland for a couple of weeks so Baker could make the house habitable. In that time he installed an air source heat pump, knocked down walls and made a temporary kitchen. Rather than move the living space upstairs as they had done for the clients down the road, they decided to retain the small living room at the front of the house. The 70s extension (white-painted bricks and a timber-clad ceiling) inspired the materials for the new extension (concrete blocks and oak-veneered birch ply). On the ground floor, the garages to one side of the plot were transformed into a guest bedroom behind a wide sliding door off the hallway. A yellow wet room is behind another sliding door. Further down the hallway is a roomy cupboard for coats/bags/shoes, and a utility room with side access to the garden and an outdoor shower for use after a dip in the sea. At the front of the house, the snug, with wood-burner, leads to a wide corridor with built-in cabinets and a desk. From here, steps lead down into the new rear extension, which is furnished with a vintage Ligne Roset sofa, a mid-century sideboard and a dining table with mismatched chairs. The dark kitchen units are a canny combination of Ikea cabinets and bespoke joinery, and the worktop is ply, covered in electric-blue Formica. Six-metre-wide sliding doors open on to a well-organised and productive garden (Eglu chicken coop included). Upstairs, there are three bedrooms and a family bathroom, where smart joinery again makes use of every available space. The master bedroom has been pushed out to the side and up into the roof space, with a diminutive en suite shower. From the bedroom window, they have a direct view of the stilted sea forts and two windfarms. “I could sit up here all day with a pair of binoculars,” Flynn says. “I never realised how much traffic was on the water at night. You can see cargo ships coming and going and the red lights of the turbines. It’s quite beautiful.” Their bedroom is furnished with a couple of solid Ikea designs: a wide rattan armchair and a set of drawers that have survived multiple house moves. In all the bedrooms, Ikea wardrobes are slowly being upgraded. “We didn’t have the budget some of our clients have, so we’ve modified Ikea furniture to make it work,” she says. The family moved back in at the start of the first lockdown in 2020. Unable to invite friends over, they took up paddleboarding and windsurfing. They spend time on the beach every day: dog walks on the shingle, sea swimming and impromptu beach barbecues with friends. The family often have dinner on the bench in front of the house, to experience the big, uninterrupted sunsets they can’t see from the back garden. To make the most of their connection to the beach, the couple replaced the driveway with grasscrete – a cellular surface filled with shingle. “We’re on a busy street,” Baker says, “but we thought it would be nice to use the front of the house a bit more.” Flynn adds: “We have often been sitting out there and friends have walked by and joined us. That wouldn’t happen if we were out the back or upstairs on a first-floor balcony.” As they are architects, I wonder if their Rightmove alerts are constantly switched on. “Mark is always looking for the next project,” Flynn says, “but I’m happy now. I don’t want to leave that,” she says, gesturing to the sea. “We can’t move away from that.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,How we remodelled our 1950s semi in Kent into a bright and breezy beach house,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/14/how-we-remodelled-our-1950s-semi-in-kent-into-a-bright-and-breezy-beach-house
5/14/2022,"The Spotted Pig, the 100-seat gastropub in New York’s trendy West Village, is under renovation. It was, until the restaurant closed in 2020, the site of a notorious, third-floor space dubbed “the rape room” by several employees who claimed that the private dining enclave was ground zero for sexual harassment by management. The rape room lives on as a darkly symbolic story in the city’s hospitality business. Mario Batali, the celebrity chef and investor in Spotted Pig, was a frequent visitor and also accused of criminal behavior on the third floor, including groping and kissing a woman who appeared to be unconscious in 2008. “We called him the Red Menace,” Trish Nelson, a former server, told the New York Times. “He tried to touch my breasts and told me that they were beautiful. He wanted to wrestle. As I was serving drinks to his table, he told me I should sit on his friend’s face.” Last week, Batali, 61, was found not guilty of indecent assault and battery after a swift trial in Boston in a case unrelated to the Spotted Pig accusations. Batali had waived his right to have a jury decide his fate in a criminal case that arose from the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault. Judge James Stanton of Boston municipal court agreed with Batali’s lawyers that the accuser, Natali Tene, 32, who said Batali forcibly kissed and grabbed her during a late-night selfie session at a Boston bar in April 2017, was not an entirely credible witness. But the judge also rebuked Batali. “It’s an understatement to say that Mr Batali did not cover himself in glory on the night in question. His conduct, his appearance and his demeanor were not befitting of a public person of his stature at that time.” The prosecutor in the case, Kevin Hayden, said he was disappointed in the verdict but grateful that Tene had come forward. “It can be incredibly difficult for a victim to disclose a sexual assault,” Hayden said, adding that when the perpetrator was “in a position of power or celebrity, the decision to report an assault can become all the more challenging and intimidating”. The outcome of the Batali trial has drawn attention to the issue of harassment in the American hospitality business, although Tene was a customer – not an employee – of the bar where the interaction occurred. The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has said that the abuse she experienced as a bartender at Coffee Shop, a now-closed bar-restaurant on Union Square well known for employing models and actors, prepared her for political life in Washington. “When you work in the service industry as a woman, you are harassed all the time. It’s just part of your job,” Ocasio-Cortez once told the Hollywood Reporter. “You’re often spoken to in a way that is very classist. You are treated like a servant. So you really get used to navigating those dynamics.” According to a Social Science Research Solutions (SSRS) survey published by One Fair Wage in January 2021, 71% of female workers had been sexually harassed at least once during their time in the restaurant industry – the highest of any industry reporting statistics. Harassment complaints come to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from restaurant industry workers more often than from any other sector. In the SSRS survey, 44% stated they had been victims of sexual harassment by someone in a management or ownership role, and sexual harassment occurred at a rate far higher for tipped staff – ie service staff – than their non-tipped counterparts. “Tipped workers were more likely to be treated in sexist ways; more likely to be targeted with sexually aggressive and degrading behavior; received more persistent and intrusive sexual attention, and were more likely to be coerced or threatened into sexual activity,” the report said. Tipped workers were also more likely than their non-tipped counterparts to say that they had been encouraged to “just forget about it”, and virtually all said they had experienced some form of retaliation for speaking out. “Sexual harassment runs rampant in the restaurant industry. The stakes are high, as restaurant jobs can be high-paying and hard to come by. So when food service workers are sexually harassed, they often do not complain out of fear of retaliation,” said Eric Baum, the New York attorney who represents Tene in her civil claim against Batali. Baum says that sexual harassment laws protecting restaurant workers are not often enforced. “Accordingly, many restaurant managers and supervisors believe that the strict standards prohibiting sexual harassment do not apply to them.” A study conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Notre Dame, Penn State University and the Emlyon Business School in France found that dependence on tips, coupled with the “service with a smile” job description, created a direct link to harassment. In the Batali case, prosecutor Nina Bonelli said that Tene had tried to “de-escalate” the unwanted touching by simply “smiling it off” in the photos. “The kissing, the groping. She never asked for it. She never consented to it,” she said. “She just wanted a selfie.” Batali’s acquittal in the Boston case follows the New York attorney general’s finding that Batali and his business partner Joseph Bastianich, their management company B&B Hospitality and their New York restaurants Babbo, Lupa and the now-closed Del Posto fostered a hostile work environment that permitted a sexualized culture of misconduct and harassment. Under an agreement last year, Batali, Bastianich and the company agreed to pay $600,000 to at least 20 former employees. “Celebrity and fame does not absolve someone from following the law. Sexual harassment is unacceptable for anyone, anywhere – no matter how powerful the perpetrator,” said the attorney general, Letitia James. Batali had earlier apologized, acknowledging the allegations “match up” with ways he had acted. “I have made many mistakes,” he said in an email newsletter at the time. “My behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility.”",News/US news,Is New York’s restaurant sector ready to tackle its sexual harassment problem?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/14/new-york-restaurant-sector-sexual-harassment-batali
5/14/2022,"I’m taking a thrice-postponed trip to the US in a few weeks, and feel conflicted that one of my longstanding beauty rituals will disappear from the schedule. My sprees in drugstores and beauty boutiques were once a full afternoon’s commitment to stocking up with rare and cult finds that were unavailable on home turf. As the years passed, and as US exclusives became rarer, my purchases became fewer. After my favourite brands – Drunk Elephant, CeraVe, Milk Makeup and Glow Recipe – launched in UK retailers, the only one left was Tatcha, a Japanese-inspired, Asian-owned luxury line of extremely high-quality, meticulously formulated skincare that my face has always adored. Inevitably, this month it landed over here (exclusively at Space NK), and, while as a tourist I’ll miss it, as a skincare obsessive, I’m ecstatic. Tatcha’s Camellia Cleansing Oil (rich, cosseting, thorough and, crucially, never dribbling on to my best ’jamas) is the only cleanser of its type I love. Ditto the Essence Skincare Boosting Treatment – a version of a Japanese-style essence made by lots of luxury brands that I, with this one exception, can never normally be bothered to use (it very gently exfoliates and hydrates, amplifying the effects of whatever comes next). The Dewy Skin Cream (sumptuous, plumping, extremely luxurious and a dream base for makeup on all grownup skins) makes my face feel as though it’s been taken to the opera. And so it should, of course, for the ticket price. Tatcha is by no one’s measure cheap, but in a beauty world where little is, I admire it for making the effort to look and feel appropriately decadent (Tatcha make every formula from scratch and if they can’t find the ingredient they need, they’ll grow it). Having bought most of the lineup at some time or another, then pointedly looked away as the converted dollars hit my bank statement, I can honestly say that almost everything here is sublime. If Tatcha is too rich for your blood, or makeup is more your poison, another US import launching this month is Gen See, a fun, high-quality collection of user-friendly makeup in wearable shades and the kinds of textures one can half-arsedly smear on at a red traffic light.

5/14/2022,"Theoretically this was the week when rugby entered a brave new world. It has certainly been a momentous-sounding few days courtesy of World Rugby’s historic decision to hold – for men and women respectively – the 2031 and 2033 World Cups in the USA, the tantalising possibility of a sold-out Twickenham for a women’s final in 2025 and renewed optimism about a Nations League tournament finally becoming reality. At the very least the tectonic plates of the old sport are shifting. Which sport would not relish a primetime World Cup final framed against the Manhattan skyline or access to a land of opportunity for both sexes? It is a universe away from the pie and pint amateur days when a Barbarians Easter tour to Penarth was pretty much the height of cross-border sophistication. Progress in rugby, though, remains a subjective concept. The sport has been professional for more than a quarter of a century but paying the bills continues to be an issue for almost every union out there. World Cups in Australia in 2027 and 2029 will be spectacular events but the Australian Rugby Union would have gone bust by now without financial assistance from World Rugby. It has been a similar story in the States, where the union filed for bankruptcy as recently as 2020. Now, we are being told, the sport is on the brink of a gum-shielded gold rush. Twenty five cities from New Orleans to Washington DC have applied to host matches with organisers projecting that 4.1 million spectators could attend one or both of the tournaments. What if the American dream really can be made flesh and mass US audiences persuaded that gridiron without helmets is a game they might enjoy? A still-distant fantasy, maybe, but remember all the scepticism when the States hosted the men’s football World Cup in 1994? These days it is the country’s third most-played sport and their women’s team are ranked top of the world. Rugby also now has nine years to get its stars and stripes-draped party absolutely right. World Rugby has received justifiable stick over the years but glimpses of clearer, more strategic thinking are emerging. And, for better or worse, it has now fired the starting pistol on a pivotal decade set to define rugby as a major international sport. By packaging up the next few World Cups together the game has essentially challenged itself, commercially and popularity-wise, to sink or swim. Bidding for the 2027 World Cup was no vanity project, conceded Rugby Australia’s chairman Hamish McLennan, but an absolute necessity down under. “In truth,” McLennan told the Sydney Morning Herald, “it was the only option we had to save the game.” The question now is whether the prospect of all these new dollars, both American and Aussie, will be enough to loosen the binding ties of self-interest that have choked rugby’s development as stubbornly as Japanese knotweed? Or, more specifically, to assist those who, hitherto, have struggled in the shadows of the established nations. Which is why the most intense discussions in Dublin this week have not involved future World Cup hosting arrangements but a mooted Nations Championship, involving 24 teams in two divisions, taking place every two years (in even-numbered years) in the existing July and November Test windows. The idea is to have a grand final and promotion/relegation playoffs, with the second-tier competition potentially starting in 2024 followed by the top tournament in 2026. It all sounds lovely in principle, assuming you take the view that effectively crowning three world champions every four years does not dilute the primacy of the World Cup. Or that criss-crossing the globe even more frequently is good for rugby’s carbon footprint. Or that it enhances player wellbeing. Either way, it will stand or fall on one key aspect which, crucially, remains unconfirmed. No one, as yet, knows the precise financial uplift the reorganisation will generate and how that revenue will be split. At present the host union keeps the gate receipts, handily ensuring the richer nations with the biggest stadiums receive the most. Will the plumpest turkeys vote for Christmas and agree to a central pot? If they genuinely ever want the game to broaden out and ensure 24 competitive sides at the 2031 Rugby World Cup, they surely cannot argue otherwise. Even in Wales they have struggled to fill the Principality Stadium during the Six Nations. Domestic crowds in South Africa and Japan have been falling and dreams of rugby taking off commercially in Asia off the back of the 2019 World Cup have stalled, with Covid far from the only reason. The better news is that Fiji now have an island-based team competing in Super Rugby and interest in the women’s game is steadily rising before this year’s World Cup in New Zealand. South Africa’s top provinces are poised to enter next season’s European Cup, the latest move in rugby’s financial drive to survive. Experts in global rugby economics, however, are holding fire on predictions of a “golden decade” which will smooth away all the game’s cares. Mark Evans, the former Harlequins chief executive who has also worked in rugby league in Australia, is among those yet to be convinced a Nations Championship on its own will transform rugby’s finances. “I wouldn’t say it’ll be life changing,” said Evans. “It all depends whether the cake has got bigger in totality. The argument is that by giving the autumn and summer Tests a clearer narrative and more meaning that will generate more revenue. In some countries that may well be true – and it will need to be.” Should the promotion and relegation playoff element end up being delayed or shelved it will also massively dilute the overall proposition. As Dan Leo, chief executive of the Pacific Rugby players’ association, observed this week: “It can’t be a financial model that’s good for the All Blacks, Australia and South Africa – there needs to be a way every rugby nation benefits from this.” Which, along with long-term concussion concerns and player welfare, is rugby’s perennial problem. Evans, though, believes the latest proposal is about as good as it is going to get. “It’s not what you would do if you were starting from scratch but you’re not. Given all the different stakeholders and all the conflicting issues it’s probably as good as they could come up with.” Everything now rests on rugby’s ability to make it happen and, even more crucially, to make it pay.",Sport/Sport,Starting pistol fires on rugby’s defining decade but can it make it pay? | Robert Kitson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/14/starting-pistol-fires-on-rugbys-defining-decade-but-can-it-make-it-pay
5/14/2022,"Ana and Karis Ferguson set up their website, Mission Eurovision, in 2015 as a way to share tips for throwing great Eurovision parties. The site, called itself “the ultimate Eurovision party planner”, includes recipes, bingo, scorecards and drinking games. “The website has grown every year, and now over 60,000 people view our Eurovision bingo each year,” the sisters, web developers in their 30s and 40s, said. Every year they celebrate a little differently. In their first year they attended the live semi-finals, but were home in the UK to watch the final with a big group of friends. This year they are putting up some union jack bunting and making cocktails inspired by Sam Ryder, the 32-year-old singer and TikTok star from Essex representing the UK. “For the first time in a while, we are really enjoying the positivity around our entry – so we are proud to show our support,” they said. The popularity of Mission Eurovision speaks to a growing trend for fans of the international singing competition to get together for screening parties. Saturday night’s final in Turin marks the first time there are no Covid-imposed restrictions in the UK, so all those who cancelled their parties or had pared-back ones over the past couple of years can finally make up for it. To top it off, the UK is in with a winning chance this year – after a devastating outcome in 2021 when it received nil points. Ryder, who was selected in a collaboration between the BBC and global music management company TaP Music, will perform his song Space Man, currently the second-favourite to win. Bars, clubs and cinemas across the UK have organised themed screening parties. In London, places such as the Two Brewers, the Troubadour and Halfway to Heaven have events on. The Royal Vauxhall Tavern has DJs playing Europop hits until 4am. “It’s difficult to express just how important Eurovision is to many LGBTQ+ people, including a large number of our customers,” James Lindsay, managing director of the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, said. “RVT is home to Eurofest, a bi-monthly Eurovision-themed club night and they are always well attended. Last year we screened the final to a limited, all-seated audience, because of Covid restrictions, but this year we are able to show the final to a full venue, in full party mode complete with Eurofest DJs.” Ian Screeton from the Troubadour said they were “so happy that we can now finally go ahead with the party and our customers from all over Europe can get together, get dressed up, listen to some music and celebrate Eurovision”. Other venues hosting Eurovision parties include Grub in Manchester, Camp and Furnace in Liverpool, Eden Bar in Birmingham and the Buttermarket in Shrewsbury. “As big Eurovision fans, the family and I were a bit put out by having our annual cheesy festivities fettered by Covid last year, and totally scuppered the year before,” a primary school teacher, Valdis, 23, said. “2020’s cancellation was an extra kick in the teeth for us: we’re Icelandic, and Daði Freyr’s viral bop was all but a guaranteed win that year.” The Londoner said his family was excited to be “back with a bang”, with a viewing party attended by guests aged 16-56. “We take our ongoing commentary very seriously, and thanks to the gorgeous bayleaf margaritas I’m sure this will get increasingly scathing – especially towards the ballads (sorry!).” Katherine Petty, 36, a general manager for Hawksmoor restaurants, said she has been holding Eurovision parties every year since 2005, bar a couple of years where she went to the competition itself. “I’m a big fan of cooking so I make dishes from different countries in Europe which is the centrepiece of the party,” she said. There is also what she calls the “usual stuff” – flags, scorecards, drinking games. “The next day is like my Boxing Day – hungover and eating the leftovers, usually with the show on repeat in the background. My obsession with Eurovision started properly in 1997 when UK won, and I’ve been hooked ever since. I can name every winner since 1956 and have loads of random facts in my head. My friends think I’m nuts.” Tim Wye, 55, a Green party councillor from Bristol, will host about 70 people at his house with two screens for the show – one in the garden and one indoors. There is one strict door policy, he said: “No cynics allowed. You can take the piss a bit but show it the respect it deserves.”",Arts/Television & radio,‘Back with a bang’: UK gets ready for the Eurovision party it’s been missing,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/14/eurovision-party-fans-uk
5/14/2022,"From his perch in the orchestra pit of the Oberammergau stage, Christian Stückl nods and points to his players above, trying to offer them helpful instructions as their dress rehearsal to a half-full house of mainly local people gets under way. “It is hard to believe we’ve got this far. I keep waiting for something to go wrong, but apart from a couple of older men forgetting their lines there’s really nothing to complain about,” the director says at the end of the five-and-a-half-hour show. The villagers of Oberammergau in the Bavarian Alps are in a state of excitement. Their “passion play” – which in 1633 their forebears vowed to God they would stage every 10 years if they were spared further deaths from the plague (they were) – is back again after having been thrown off its usual schedule by two years owing to the latest pandemic. Depicting the life, persecution, death and resurrection of Jesus, the 42nd season of what is believed to be the oldest continuous running amateur theatre production in the world will open on Saturday with a 103-performance run until October. The play is the village’s raison d’etre. It is taken for granted that almost every one of the 5,200 residents who is eligible, from babies to nonagenarians, plays a part either on or off the stage. All children are allowed, as is anyone who has lived in the village for 20 years or more. “The last time we had to delay was 100 years ago, due to the Spanish flu, as well as deaths and injuries from the first world war, after which it was rescheduled for 1922,” Stückl says. “Pandemics and the passion play have a certain tradition.” Despite misgivings over whether it would be able to go ahead, the usual decree went out on Ash Wednesday last year, forbidding male participants from cutting their hair or shaving their beards until the production closed the following October. “It was hard for us to believe until recently that it would actually go ahead as the coronavirus infection rate had exploded, but most of us stuck to the rules and didn’t cut our beards in the hope it still would,” said Werner Richter, a taxi driver who has taken part in every production since 1970. His grandchildren are among the 400 youngsters on stage and his son, Andreas, a former Jesus and a psychologist by profession, has one of the lead roles as the high priest Caiaphas. About 400 players who had signed up to take part in 2020 were forced to drop out, some due to changing life plans, others owing to their refusal to be vaccinated or to take a daily test. The Catalan donkey Sancho, on whose back Jesus was due to ride into Jerusalem, has gone into retirement, replaced by the younger Aramis. “But luckily we have continuity where it matters, as most of those in the 42 lead roles have stuck with it,” Stückl says. The pandemic aside, his main challenge ever since becoming director at the age of 24 in 1990 has been to retain the existing but ageing audience while pushing the boundaries of the conservative Bavarian Catholic perspective he has often viewed as limited. He describes his biggest mission as trying to rid the passion play of the antisemitic view that Jews were collectively responsible for the death of Jesus, for which it was especially instrumentalised in the Nazi era with Hitler visiting twice. “We are in constant and deep dialogue with religious representatives now,” Stückl says. In 2010 he depicted Jesus lifting the Torah as the choir sang a version of the Jewish prayer Shema Yisrael, considered a high point of the play by participants and spectators. This year there is a new musical setting in Hebrew of Psalm 22 (“My God, My God, Why have you forsaken me?”) by the music director Markus Zwink, which is to be released internationally on a recording of the entire two-hour soundtrack for the first time. The cast is also more diverse this year than it has ever been, including refugee children and Muslim actors in lead roles. In the context of the play’s history this is a radical move, and Stückl points out the storm that erupted in 1990 when he let a Protestant on to the stage for the first time – triggering a petition by the local priest that 1,800 people signed, hoping to push the director out. He is also working on how to boost the role of women (married women over 35 were unable to take part until a court ruling 32 years ago). “The production is very overladen with men,” he admits. “But then it is a very male-laden story.” He has considerably expanded the time spent on the stage by Jesus’s mother, Mary, as well as Veronica, who wipes his face, and Mary Magdalene, considered to be his closest female follower, and he has introduced the role of Pilate’s wife, previously mentioned only by a male servant who voiced her objection over Jesus’s treatment. In his dressing room backstage at the 5,200-seat theatre, 41-year-old Frederik Mayet, who alternates playing Jesus with another actor, shows some of his props and aids. There is a climbing belt that fits beneath his loin cloth and keeps him fastened safely to the cross during the crucifixion scene, and a menacing-looking crown of thorns with blunted spikes. Outside, leaning against the wall, is the three-metre grey wooden crucifix itself, all 90kg of it, which he must carry. “It is as heavy as it looks,” he jokes. For Mayet – whose family first participated in the play in 1890 and whose children, three and eight, are with him on stage – the perennial question, as it is for most Oberammergauers, is how to ensure the play remains relevant. “As a community our passion for the play and our courage to believe in it is unabated,” he says. “Fundamentally the story for me is less about the theological details and more about emphasising its relevance to our experience of being human.” Mayet also played Jesus in 2010. “But now the world is a different place,” he says, referring in particular to the effects of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the increasing displacement of people and mounting ecological disaster. This time his Jesus is – under Stückl’s direction – “more political, more angry, someone looking for social justice.” He has sought inspiration, he says, everywhere he can find it. It is thanks to the entrepreneur excursion salesman Thomas Cook, who discovered the play for himself in 1880 and began selling passion play package tours, that it has such a big following abroad. Its single biggest set of fans are from the US. But this year the war in Ukraine has already put off tens of thousands of Americans, who have cancelled their trips to Europe. To make up the shortfall, the call has gone out to Germans to come to discover the play. Otherwise the focus in the village is on getting through unscathed to October. The biggest dread, widely voiced, is that both Jesuses go down with coronavirus at the same time. Stückl says when it is over he will go on retreat to an ashram in India, “happy to get Jesus out of my head”. Janina Nowotka, a hairdresser, says she’ll be waiting for the queues of men outside her salon. “They are desperate to get their hair cut by then,” she says. “They come in and are given a beer and the mood is jovial and festive. And those that can’t wait just stand on the street and lop each other’s hair off.”",News/World news,‘We kept our beards’: Oberammergau’s passion play emerges from pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/14/we-kept-our-beards-oberammergaus-passion-play-emerges-from-pandemic
5/14/2022,"When Prof Gavin Brown, pro vice-chancellor at Liverpool University, first made contact with academics at Sumy State University (SSU) in north-eastern Ukraine a few weeks ago, he did not expect to come off the call and start ordering new windows. One of SSU’s main buildings had been destroyed in a Russian bomb attack. Among the university’s many immediate needs, it had to replace 110 windows – but managers could not source glass in war-torn Ukraine. Brown told them to send him the measurements. Liverpool is one of 44 British universities that have signed up in recent weeks to “twin” with a struggling Ukrainian university. UK academics say the weekly Zoom meetings, slotted in around air raid sirens, with female staff who have fled calling in from across Europe, are “humbling” and “emotional”. The idea is to make sure that when the war with Russia ends, Ukraine’s universities will still exist, so their staff and students can help rebuild the battered country. Fortunately, Liverpool University happens to have its own building company with connections to glass manufacturers, and Brown has heard that supplies like this are making it across Ukraine. “This is about understanding what these universities need and offering real, practical help,” he says. The challenges do not stop here. “Many female staff have left and are trying to do what work they can from a distance. Many male staff are fighting,” Brown says. Universities at the sharp end of the invasion in eastern Ukraine believe all their female students have fled the region, with many leaving the country. But the universities do not want to lose them. Liverpool plans to share online teaching materials to keep SSU students engaged. The university may also take in some of the staff, helping them to put lectures and lab experiments online for their colleagues at home. Brown emphasises his university will be a temporary base and when the time is right, the staff will return. “It is clearly a fear of the Ukrainian universities that there will be a brain drain,” he says. Liverpool, unlike some western universities, has deliberately not offered scholarships to fleeing Ukrainian students who may want to transfer. Brown says that if recipients decide not to go back this would do significant harm. “The whole point of what we are doing is to try to support Sumy students to continue to study with their own university,” he says. “They will be critical in helping with the rebuilding of Ukraine.” Kyiv National University of Technologies and Design has told its new twin, Sheffield Hallam University, that the main help needed is with motivating their displaced students to study again. James Richardson, director of global development and partnerships at Sheffield Hallam, says this is no small task as students fleeing the war will have more immediate priorities than resuming their course. And, crucially, the university does not know where most of them are. “We understand pretty much all of their female staff have left Kyiv or have left Ukraine altogether. This has resulted in them having no functional administration,” he says. In Kyiv, air raid sirens go off every day and night. Richardson’s main contact at the Ukrainian university has to schedule meetings around when he is next on patrol. “I know staff who are still there are cold,” Richardson says. “The first call we had, they said it was -3C at night and they are in unheated cellars. From outside we might think things are quieter in Kyiv, but they feel very much under attack.” The two universities have many overlapping courses, and Sheffield Hallam wants to share resources such as online lectures, recorded during the pandemic. Many of the Ukrainian students speak English, so language will not be a significant barrier. “The biggest challenge is going to be connecting with the students to tell them about it,” he says. Richardson hopes to bring staff and students at both universities together on virtual projects in the autumn. However, he says: “Right now they aren’t really functioning so it will be hard to offer much other than our support. But we are in this for the long term, planning for next year and a long way beyond.” Their last Zoom call, which 12 Ukrainian academics joined from across Ukraine and Europe, was “emotional”. Richardson says: “I think it meant a lot to them to know there is another institution that is simply there for them.” “This is about giving them hope,” he adds. “It is a reminder that they are fighting for something important. Universities are a huge part of their social and cultural fabric, as well as their economic future.” Charles Cormack, founder of Cormack Consultancy Group, which is running the twinning scheme alongside the vice-chancellors’ group Universities UK, says what UK universities are doing is listening to what their Ukrainian colleagues need. “At the meetings I’ve been involved in you just don’t hear the word ‘no’.” York University has twinned with Karazin Kharkiv National University, one of Ukraine’s most prestigious institutions, whose buildings are in ruins from shelling. Prof Saul Tendler, deputy vice-chancellor at York, says one of the Ukrainian university’s many worries is protecting its libraries and archive collections. “They tell us they are in damp basements now and that’s not great,” he says. “If they can get them out of the country, we will hold them in our repositories.” Like other universities, York is exploring offering summer schools for Ukrainian students, either in the city or virtually. Karazin also wants York to run summer sessions for its staff on moving teaching online, likely to be necessary for some time given the condition of the university’s buildings. However, even communicating can be a challenge. Tendler says: “They are enduring unbelievable suffering, spending large parts of their lives in bomb shelters.” Karazin’s leaders have said the collaboration must be “one good deed at a time”, because of the stresses they are under. As Tendler says: “You’d love to be able to wrap your arms around them and do lots of things very fast, but actually right now they can’t cope with that.” Glasgow University has been asked by its twin, the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, to provide up to 100 places for female students across a range of disciplines to study at Glasgow for the first semester next year. The Scottish university plans to waive all fees and is exploring what accommodation and extra financial support it can offer. Rachel Sandison, deputy vice-chancellor for external engagement, says her conversations with Ukrainian colleagues are “humbling” and “heartbreaking”, but she takes solace from knowing they are doing some good. Richardson, at Sheffield Hallam, says: “When this is all over, if there were no Ukrainian universities because buildings have been destroyed and staff and students have just left, it would take generations to rebuild.”",News/Education,‘Giving hope’: UK universities twin with struggling Ukraine counterparts,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/14/giving-hope-uk-universities-twin-with-struggling-ukraine-counterparts
