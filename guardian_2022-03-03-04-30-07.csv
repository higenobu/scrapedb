3/3/2022,"At the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a week ago, almost every analyst agreed that Russian oil and gas would keep flowing westwards. The state of mutual energy dependence seemed too entrenched. On one side, the EU could not decouple itself easily from the source of 38% of its natural gas imports. On the other, Russia under financial sanctions would need cash. Old hands reflected that, even in the long decades of the cold war, the Soviet Union and Europe maintained commercial relationships in energy. A week later, such thinking looks naive. The “shock and awe” financial sanctions, especially those aimed at Russia’s central bank, exceed anything previously seen, but the shortcoming is obvious: if you really want to hit the Russian economy hard, the place to aim is its energy export sector, a part that has been spared sanctions so far and generates hundreds of millions of dollars daily. The point is made repeatedly by Ukrainian officials in their appeals for the trade to cease, and its moral force is hammered home with every fresh Russian atrocity. The White House said on Wednesday it is “very open” to the idea of energy sanctions on Russia. One might say cynically that it is easier to air such sentiments from Washington than Europe, but even German ministers are publicly taking about what would happen if Russia halted gas supplies suddenly. “We are prepared for that. I can give the all-clear for the current winter and summer,” said Robert Habeck, economy minister. Nuclear power stations, currently set for imminent closure, could be kept switched on and coal-fired stations could be used as back-up, he argued. If that’s really the case, the obvious question is why the west shouldn’t just get on with imposing a few energy sanctions – even if only caps on imports initially – and accept the financial pain. There is a foretaste already amid the various “self-sanctioning” measures taken by European refineries to avoid buying Russian oil and by European gas suppliers (including Centrica) to disentangle themselves from Gazprom. The price of a barrel Brent hit $113 on Wednesday, the highest for seven years. UK natural gas prices returned to last autumn’s sky-high levels and pump prices are setting records. Prices would probably go even higher if full-blown energy sanctions were imposed, but what about security of supply? Here’s Brussels thinktank Bruegel: “If the EU is forced or willing to bear the cost, it should be possible to replace Russian gas already for next winter without economic activity being devastated, people freezing, or electricity supply being disrupted.” It also, it should be said, described the challenge as “momentous”, said rules would have to be rewritten and concluded “exceptional measures” might be needed to reduce demand. But the shorthand version seems to be: yes, if you are prepared to accept the costs, it’s doable. That, one suspects, is where the sanctions debate is rapidly heading. It should probably have been there from the off. Aviva’s plan to return £4.75bn to shareholders didn’t quite reach the target of £5bn set by activist investor Cevian Capital, but the sum should be enough. The £250m gap can be mentally covered by Aviva’s accompanying £385m purchase of UK financial adviser firm Succession Wealth. Even activists tend not to object to conventional bolt-on acquisitions. The missing bit in the script is a higher share price. At 410p, Aviva stands roughly where it was three years ago, before chief executive Amanda Blanc got to work with a series of major overseas disposals and a heavy cost-cutting programme. It’s a slightly odd position. The fresh element of the return of capital represents a quarter of Aviva’s stock market value and Blanc’s dividend promise of 33p for 2023 represents a fat yield in the offing, which ought to get the attention of income investors. Put it down to a lack of faith in the idea that Aviva can really emerge as a reliable generator of cash. That’s hardly the fault of Blanc, who has done everything she promised and has now set a few financial targets to be judged on. But, yes, after 20 years of disappointments for shareholders, the idea that Aviva might be fixed may take a while to become truly believable.",News/World news,"If you want to hit Russian economy hard, aim for energy export",https://www.theguardian.com/world/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/02/if-you-want-to-hit-russian-economy-hard-aim-for-energy-export
3/3/2022,"The brutal impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine was laid bare on Wednesday, as reports emerged that a Ukrainian police officer had lost his entire family while others including a Ukrainian TV cameraman and an Israeli DJ were cited as among other victims. Ukrainian media reported that a family of five had been killed while trying to flee from Kherson, as Russian troops entered the city. Those killed were the wife, parents, daughter and baby son of Ukrainian police officer Oleg Fedko, according to Ukrainian news outlet Zaxid. It reported that the family were trying to escape the incoming troops in two cars when they were attacked near Nova Kakhovka on the outskirts of Kherson. The officer’s wife, Irina, six-year-old daughter, Sofia, and baby son, Ivan, along with his father, Oleg, and mother, Anna, were all killed, it said. The officer’s brother Denis Fedko told the news outlet that he was talking on the phone to his mother when she started shouting that there were children in the car. Then he heard shots ring out. The attack is understood to have happened last Thursday. The older couple reportedly died at the scene. The children were taken to hospital, but died despite attempts to save their lives. Meanhile, a TV cameraman who was among the first victims of Tuesday’s attack on Kyiv TV tower has been identified as Yevhenii Sakun. He was killed as a result of the Russian missile strike which hit the tower situated close to Babyn Yar, a ravine and burial place for 30,000 Jews killed by the Nazis. At least five people are thought to have died in the attack, Olga Tokariuk, a journalist with Spanish news agency EFE, said her former colleague had been killed in the blast, and posted a photo of his press card on Twitter. She wrote: “The first person I know died in this war. My former colleague, TV cameraman Yevhenii Sakun, was killed yesterday as a result of Russian missile strike on Kyiv’s Babyn Yar, along with 4 other people. It was a pleasure working with him. I’m devastated by this news. Eternal memory. In Israel, mourning began as news emerged that an Israeli national who had been living in Ukraine with his family had also been killed. Israeli DJ Roman Brodsky, a father of two, was shot dead in his vehicle at a checkpoint outside Kyiv, while attempting to leave Ukraine and return to Israel, the Times of Israel reported. The Foreign Ministry said Brodsky was part of a convoy of vehicles travelling to the Moldovan border to leave the country. He and his partner were intending to then fly to Israel. The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, said: “On behalf of all citizens of Israel, I want to send my condolences to Roman’s wife, children and family in Israel and in Ukraine.

3/3/2022,"Labour backbenchers including John McDonnell and Diane Abbott have pulled out of attending a Stop the War rally in London on Wednesday amid pressure from Keir Starmer over the group’s stance on Ukraine. The Labour leader told his party’s MPs on Monday there was “no place” in the party for anyone drawing a “false equivalence” between the actions of Nato and those of Moscow. Labour sources had suggested that if backbenchers made any comments at the Wednesday evening rally that were critical of Nato or sought to blame the western alliance for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it could lead to the whip being withdrawn. McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, subsequently released a statement saying he would not attend the event at Conway Hall in London despite being listed as a speaker. “People are dying on the streets of Ukrainian cities. This is not the time to be distracted by political arguments here,” he told the website LabourList. “Nothing is more important at this time. Nothing should distract us from that. So I won’t feed into that distraction by going tonight.” Abbott, the former shadow home secretary, told the Guardian she would not be attending either. Some leftwing Labour MPs believe Starmer is seeking a pretext to suspend them from the party, and are keen not to hand him any opportunity to do so. McDonnell said it was important for socialists to “stay on the pitch for as long as it takes”. McDonnell and Abbott were among 11 Labour backbenchers who yielded to pressure from the party’s chief whip last week and withdrew their names from a Stop the War motion urging Nato to “call a halt to its eastward expansion” and accusing the UK government of “sabre-rattling” over Ukraine. Starmer is keen to press home the shift in Labour’s approach to foreign affairs since he took over from Jeremy Corbyn a year ago. He has offered staunch support to the government over Ukraine while pushing for tougher action on sanctions. The Labour leader used a Guardian article last month to attack Stop the War, in which Corbyn continues to play a prominent role, effectively accusing the group of siding with Russia. “At best they are naive, at worst they actively give succour to authoritarian leaders who directly threaten democracies. There is nothing progressive in showing solidarity with the aggressor,” Starmer wrote. A Labour spokesperson said: “Keir Starmer has set out the position of the Labour party and that is the position we expect every Labour MP to follow.” Asked whether Stop the War could be proscribed by the party, so that Labour members would effectively be banned from supporting it, he added: “That would be a matter for the national executive committee.” Andrew Murray, deputy president of Stop the War alongside Jeremy Corbyn, condemned the approach, saying: “Keir Starmer’s authoritarian fear of Stop the War demeans him and the Labour party, not us. We have been proved right on Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya where Labour leaders were wrong. We are right in demanding de-escalation in Ukraine too, including immediate Russian troop withdrawal and a halt to Nato expansion.” Corbyn still has the whip suspended over his reaction to the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s critical report on Labour’s handling of antisemitism complaints under his leadership. He now sits as an independent and unless Starmer restores the whip will not be allowed to stand as a Labour candidate at the next general election.",News/Politics,John McDonnell and Diane Abbott pull out of Stop the War rally,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/02/john-mcdonnell-and-diane-abbott-pull-out-of-stop-the-war-rally
3/3/2022,"The Australian economy at the end of 2021 rebounded for one reason alone – people coming out of lockdowns in the late winter and spring period spent their money. But ironically this massive surge of growth from households comes at a time when workers are receiving a smaller share of the economy than ever before. During the global financial crisis, then Treasury secretary Ken Henry famously advised the Rudd government that the best way to drive the recovery was “go early, go hard, go households”. The reason being that household spending makes up just over half of Australia’s economy and if people are spending money, then the economy will do well. The latest GDP figures for the December quarter of last year are not a case of government stimulus to households powering growth, but instead one where household spending delivered a major boon to the economy because people in New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT were able to come out of lockdown and once again spend money. In the December quarter, Australia’s economy grew by an equal record 3.4%. But don’t get too excited about the record – it only occurred because in the September quarter last year the economy shrank by the third-biggest amount ever: If the graph does not display please click here And essentially all of this record growth came from household spending: If the graph does not display please click here The other biggest generator of growth besides our spending was that of the “change in inventories” which occurred because businesses built up their inventories (in order to makes things for and sell things to households). And what did we increase our spending on? Overwhelming nonnecessities – recreation and culture, clothing and eating out: If the graph does not display please click here But this is decidedly a case where just looking at one quarter hides how big the damage of the pandemic has been. Despite the strong pick-up, household spending in cafes, restaurants and the like in the last three months of 2021 was still 14% below that in the same period in 2019. The use of transport services meanwhile remains 74% below the pre-Covid period: If the graph does not display please click here The boost in the economy also did not come from across the nation – it really was just driven by NSW, Victoria and the ACT. These states and territory had been in lockdown in the September quarter, and so, not surprisingly, saw a massive jump in activity after the restrictions were removed: If the graph does not display please click here These rather absurd quarterly growth figures mean focusing on three-month periods can exaggerate for good or ill what is going on. If we instead look at the amount of economic activity over the course of 12 months, we are able to see much more clearly the impact of the pandemic and our recovery: If the graph does not display please click here In the first three months of last year, Australia’s annual activity was some 4.6% below the median-term trend. Essentially our economy was $95bn smaller than expected. Now we are 2.1% behind the trend pace, suggesting that, all going well, by the end of this year we should be back to where we were expected to be prior to the pandemic. That would be an astonishing recovery, but one thing that currently is not assisting things is government support. The end of the homebuilder program after the initial hit from the instant-asset write-off saw dwelling construction and investment in machinery and equipment decline in the last quarter of 2021: If the graph does not display please click here While the instant-asset write-off did produce a big jump in the investment in machinery and equipment, the reality is there are only so many utes and tools small businesses can buy. That hit last year may now be followed by an ongoing slump in such investment. What we also can see is that the government spending and investment is no longer providing stimulus to the economy: If the graph does not display please click here Government spending was essentially flat, while public investment fell. The problem is so too did private sector investment. Given government stimulus bolstered our economy during the pandemic, its withdrawal now will inevitably hinder the economy. That would be fine if the private sector was ready to take over, but at this stage it appears not. One thing businesses can’t blame is labour costs. In the last three months of 2021, real non-farm labour costs fell 0.2% and they are now 3% below what they were prior to the pandemic. If the graph does not display please click here This mean that as we now pass through the end of the pandemic lockdowns we find that the share of the economic pie going to workers is smaller than ever. In the December quarter just 46% of GDP went to the compensation of employees – 1.5 percentage points lower than it was two years earlier and lower than at any time in recorded history. Households are driving economic growth, but workers are not getting their fair share of rewards.",News/Business,Don’t get too excited by Australia’s rebounding economy – it's a distorted snapshot of the true picture | Greg Jericho,https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2022/mar/03/dont-get-too-excited-by-australias-rebounding-economy-its-a-distorted-snapshot-of-the-true-picture
3/3/2022,"Ukrainians do not want to flee. They do not want to pack their lives into a suitcase. They do not want to crowd aboard packed trains that carry them away from their homes, or trudge for days with their children. They do not want to leave behind husbands and sons and parents. They do not want to begin again in a foreign country where they have nothing, far from those they love. They go because they are under attack. They go because missiles are falling. They go because their sisters call to say that Russian soldiers have entered their towns. They go because they see what Vladimir Putin’s war machine is already doing in Ukraine, and because they know what it has done before. They go because if they do not go now, tomorrow may be too late. They go because they must. Despite the bravery and resolve of Ukrainians, the reality of what is happening and the enormity of the approaching horror is coming home. “They all have orders to erase our history, erase our country, erase us all,” the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Wednesday. Russia claimed to have taken the city of Kherson, though local authorities disputed that, and airborne troops have landed near the centre of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city. The mayor of Mariupol said the wounded could not be evacuated because of heavy shelling. Konotop’s mayor told residents that the invaders had given them an ultimatum: “If we start resisting, they’ll wipe out the town using artillery.” (The crowd appears to have backed resistance nonetheless.) This is a war so calamitous that 141 countries voted to denounce it at the UN general assembly – where the only nations siding with Russia were Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria. In less than one week following the invasion, at least 660,000 people fled Ukraine. Many more are trying to do so. The UN refugee agency warns that 4 million could leave the country. Poland is not even requiring passports from arrivals. The EU plans to grant temporary protection, including a residence permit and access to employment and social welfare, for up to three years. Countries long hostile to refugees have made an exception for their neighbours. (“It’s different in Ukraine than in countries like Afghanistan,” was the bald explanation from Austria’s chancellor, Karl Nehammer.) The British response, in contrast, has been callous and grudging. Under growing pressure, the government now plans to allow a further 100,000 relatives of Ukrainian nationals to enter, and to create a new visa sponsorship route allowing businesses to bring Ukrainians here. The prime minister had the gall to describe the arrangements as “already … very generous indeed”. That he could even claim it to be so reflects the inhumanity of his government’s broader policies. The Home Office boast of a “bespoke” sponsor route means, as immigration barrister Colin Yeo points out, a rejection of the existing international framework for the protection of refugees. When politically expedient, the government creates exemptions for those it deems worthy while seeking new ways to shut others out. Even as it claims benevolence towards Ukrainians, it tries to criminalise seeking asylum through an irregular route via its nationality and borders bill, while closing down safe alternatives. Only rejection by the Lords this week has stood in its way. The UK should extend its hand not because those in need are Ukrainian, but because of the scale of the tragedy that is befalling them.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Ukraine’s desperation: escaping Putin’s cruelty | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/the-guardian-view-on-ukraines-refugees
3/3/2022,"Joe Biden hit the road to put his domestic agenda back in the spotlight on Wednesday following a state of the union address that assailed Russian president Vladimir Putin and drew mixed reviews. The US president travelled to the battleground state of Wisconsin to highlight his bipartisan infrastructure law but faced questions from reporters about Ukraine as he departed the White House. Asked if President Volodymyr Zelenskiy should leave the country or stay put, Biden said: “I think it’s his judgment to make and we’re doing everything we can.” Questioned whether he is considering banning Russian oil imports, the president replied: “Nothing is off the table.” The uneasy balancing act between domestic and foreign priorities was reflected in his first State of the Union address on Tuesday night. Ukraine was inevitably the opening topic, drawing rare bipartisan support, but ultimately made up less than a fifth of Biden’s remarks. At the heart of the the 62-minute primetime speech were the economy, voting rights, the coronavirus pandemic and the president’s ailing social spending and climate agenda, drawing criticism from Republicans. Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia welcomed Biden’s plan to ban Russian flights from US airspace and reinforce Nato partnerships but added: “The president immediately followed this by going through his laundry list of partisan priorities. “The Biden administration’s policies have led to record inflation, an ongoing crisis at the southern border, a disastrous and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan, skyrocketing gas, energy, and grocery costs, and increased instability abroad.” Few presidents in American history have had so many urgent national and international crises bearing down on them so early in their first term in office, and few have faced a nation so divided on multiple issues. Less than half of Americans approve of Biden, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. The national opinion poll, conducted from 28 February to 1 March, found that 43% of adults approve of Biden’s performance in office while 54% disapprove and the rest were not sure. Against this inauspicious backdrop, his state of the union addressed gained a symbolic boost as members of Congress did not wear face masks because of falling Covid case rates (although five members had tested positive before the speech). History was made as two women – Vice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi – sat behind the president. But a speech normally aimed at an American audience also had to speak to an anxious global audience in what one senator, Marco Rubio, has described as “the most dangerous moment in 60 years” given Putin’s potential humiliation and nuclear capability. Biden, who has framed his presidency around a defining struggle between democracies and autocracies, sought to rally allies, stating: “Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and totally unprovoked. He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.“He thought the west and Nato wouldn’t respond. He thought he could divide us at home, in this chamber, in this nation. He thought he could divide us in Europe as well. But Putin was wrong. We are ready. We are united. And that’s what we did: we stayed united.” He vowed: “When the history of this era is written, Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.” Biden earned more applause from both Democrats and Republicans by warning Russian oligarchs that a new task force would help “find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We’re coming for your ill-begotten gains.” He also outlined the sanctions that have isolated Putin with remarkable speed and, in an ad lib not in his prepared remarks, warned: “He has no idea what’s coming.” Among the most emotional moments of the night was a standing ovation or Ukrainian ambassador Oksana Markarova sitting in the gallery. Some members of both parties wore yellow and blue outfits, pinned ribbons to their lapels or held miniature flags to show their support for Ukraine. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, said in a speech on Wednesday: “When the president called on the chamber to stand up and applaud Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador, the feeling in the room reminded me of the unity we all felt after 9/11.” On Wednesday, a member of the Ukrainian parliament Oleksandra Ustinova described the speech as a “total disappointment”, saying without the enforcement of a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which the US said it would not help to enforce, “people will literally die.” During the address, Biden no made mention of last year’s military withdrawal from Afghanistan, a move that ended America’s longest war but descended into chaos and rattled allies. At one point in the address, Biden made reference to troops in Afghanistan and Iraq breathing in toxic smoke from burn pits returning in flag-draped coffins. Lauren Boebert, a far right Republican congresswoman, heckled: “You put them in: 13 of them!” – a reference to 13 service personnel killed during the Afghan evacuation. Later Kim Reynolds, the governor of Iowa, giving the official Republican response to the state of the union address, said he had failed to make America respected around the world again. “The disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal did more than cost American lives; it betrayed our allies and emboldened our enemies.” The bipartisan comity also unravelled as soon as Biden’s devoted the lion’s share of his speech to domestic concerns. He pointed to progress against the pandemic since last year, with a dramatic reduction in cases, readily available vaccines and tests, and new therapeutics soon becoming more accessible. “Tonight, I can say we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines. It’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again. Let’s use this moment to reset.” But he did not use the words “Build Back Better”, the name of his stalled legislative agenda, instead talking about “building a better America”. He insisted he would confront inflation, promising that he has a “better plan” to reduce cost increases than Republicans. Biden repeated his call to pass voting rights legislation but, a year after his first speech to a joint session of Congress surprised many with its progressive ambitions, tried to push Democrats towards centre ground by rejecting calls to “defund the police” and pledging: “We need to secure the border and fix the immigration system.” Republicans, however, made clear that unity remains the exception, not the norm, and suggested that address will do little to change political dynamics ahead of November’s midterm elections. Senator John Cornyn of Texas told the Hugh Hewitt Show: “It was not a great speech, and I think, unfortunately, it was a rehash of a lot of his failed domestic policies … He really didn’t offer any solutions. I’m afraid that he realises this is going to be a disastrous midterm election, and he just doesn’t know how to turn the ship around.”",News/US news,Biden bids to talk up ailing agenda after State of the Union draws mixed reviews,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/02/joe-biden-state-of-the-union-russia-putin
3/3/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s aggression against Ukraine is not limited to territorial objectives. The target is Ukrainian nationhood itself – a warped dimension to the Russian president’s thinking that was underestimated by many western analysts in the buildup to war. Mr Putin’s enthusiasm for ultranationalist historiography and quasi-religious ideas of Slavic identity was already known. But the extent to which those doctrines informed his policy was not widely enough appreciated before the televised address last month in which he claimed (wrongly) that modern Ukraine was an invention of the Bolsheviks, and denied the country’s right to statehood. He sees post-Soviet borders as injuries on the body of a greater Russian motherland that must be avenged. It is the language not just of authoritarian menace but tyrannical derangement. If any hope can be salvaged from the Russian president’s estrangement from reality, it is that he might also lose touch with his own people and alienate the soldiers and civilian cronies who take his orders. Opposition polling currently suggests majority support for the “special operation” in Ukraine, although there is a divide between generations. Among Russians under the age of 30, support and opposition are more evenly split. That is before the effect of sanctions has been felt. The cost could have differential impacts. Some will see it through Mr Putin’s lens – as proof of western aggression. But a generation that has grown up enjoying fluid contacts with Europe might find cultural isolation and economic autarky hard to tolerate. There are signs that the Kremlin is not confident of keeping public opinion onside by the usual propaganda methods. What little independent media has hitherto been tolerated is being silenced. Gestures of solidarity with Ukraine are being criminalised. Accounts of schoolchildren and their parents detained in police cells after laying flowers at the Ukrainian embassy suggest escalation to totalitarian levels of repression. Under these circumstances, demonstrations against the war are acts of tremendous courage. The many Russians who are outraged and ashamed at what is being done in their name count also among the victims of Putinism. Another variable is the disillusionment of Russian soldiers in Ukraine, distressed and disoriented, discovering that the story they were told – of a grateful captive people eager for liberation – was a cruel lie. Their falling morale and the anger of their parents back home did not feature in Mr Putin’s calculations. Disagreement within the regime itself will be much harder to detect. The Kremlin power structures combine neo-Soviet statecraft and oligarchic gangster capitalism. The balance of power has shifted over years from private sector bandits to their security service protectors, but it is all part of the same kleptocracy. If the money stops flowing, Mr Putin’s ideological fantasies will not compensate those who find themselves out of pocket. That makes the internal situation more brittle and volatile than it perhaps looks from the outside. But the self-interest of lesser thugs who might think their boss has gone too far is not a dependable source of restraint. The Putin regime, for all its rhetoric of national revival, does not represent the interests of anyone beyond the circle that is enriched and empowered by its vicious methods. In targeting Ukrainian nationhood, Mr Putin wages war also against the better Russia that cannot express itself as long as he is in power.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Russian dissent: a slide to totalitarianism | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/the-guardian-view-on-russian-dissent-a-slide-to-totalitarianism
3/3/2022,"Britain’s leading business groups are at loggerheads with the government over their call to drop the use of the word “chairman”, arguing the term is archaic and needs updating. In a battle over the use of gendered language, bosses representing thousands of firms across the country said ministers should bring forward legislation to use the neutral term “chair” in the UK’s official corporate register – the home of company documents. In an open letter to the government asking for the change, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), Make UK, the Institute of Directors and the Confederation of British Industry said “chairman” was still used by Companies House as its default term for the model articles of association for new firms, meaning it was then repeated in the documents for thousands of businesses. The letter said enforcing a gender-neutral term could be easily incorporated into upcoming corporate governance legislation. Sarah Howard, the chair of the BCC, said: “It’s a small but very significant alteration that will help break down subconscious bias and send a clear message to future generations that they have an equal role to play in running businesses, whatever their gender identity. “There is much more that all of us need to do to help address inequality in the business world and this change would send a clear message on government intent.” Despite the push, it is thought that the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has so far dismissed the request in private meetings. Officials said companies currently have the flexibility to craft their own articles of association, while updating the rules would require ministers to bring forward new legislation. A source close to Kwarteng said the decision was not linked to culture wars and instead was about prioritising parliamentary time. “There is the coronavirus pandemic and the worst war on European soil for 70 years, so understandably there are pressures on parliamentary time,” they said. All the signatories of the letter said they would take steps to amend their own articles to use the word “chair” and would encourage other businesses to follow suit. Dame Judith Hackitt, chair of Make UK, said she hoped the government would support the “small, but positive and highly symbolic” move. “This is a welcome and long overdue change, which is easy to make and which I hope all businesses across the UK will support. Despite progress in recent years, it remains the case that women are underrepresented in the most senior roles across companies.” According to the FTSE Women Leaders Review for 2022, as few as 8% of chief executives in the FTSE 100 are women and they represent as few as 13.7% of executive directorships. Research from the World Bank has also suggested a direct link between the use of gendered language and differing employment rates between men and women. A government spokesperson said: “We wholeheartedly support increasing the diversity of business leaders and championing women in business. “Companies already have the flexibility to craft their own articles and to amend their articles as they see fit.”",News/Politics,UK businesses call on government to drop gendered term ‘chairman’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/02/uk-business-groups-call-government-drop-gendered-term-chairman
3/3/2022,"The latest public blow to under-fire Phil Mickelson was delivered before an unforeseen boost after Rory McIlroy called for clemency towards the six-time major champion. In December, Mickelson claimed he won the PGA Tour’s inaugural player impact program which rewards those who bring attention to the sport. It has now emerged Tiger Woods actually took the $8m top prize despite not hitting a shot in competition during 2021. “How is this possible?” asked Tour professional Kevin Na. Mickelson was second, which carries a $6m payout. Woods could not resist a social media jibe at his old adversary as the results were published. Five criteria – internet searches, earned media, social media, TV sponsor exposure and public awareness – were used to determine a top 10. Mickelson is taking a break from golf and has lost sponsors after being engulfed in a scandal related to his comments about a Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway tour. McIlroy initially branded Mickelson’s words “naive, egotistical, selfish, ignorant.” Speaking before the Arnold Palmer Invitational, McIlroy said Mickelson should be afforded some leeway. “It is unfortunate,” said McIlroy of Mickelson’s situation. “I think Phil has been a wonderful ambassador for the game of golf, still is a wonderful ambassador for the game of golf. “Look, Phil will be back. I think the players want to see him back. He’s done such a wonderful job for the game of golf and he’s represented the game very, very well for the entirety of his career. “We all make mistakes. We all say things we want to take back. No one is different in that regard. But we should be allowed to make mistakes. We should be allowed to ask for forgiveness and for people to forgive us and move on. Hopefully, he comes back at some stage, he will be, people will welcome him back and be glad that he is back.” McIlroy finished third in the impact programme earning him $3.5m. Unlike Na, he has no problem with Woods’ position. “You look at the 10 guys that are on there, and they’re the 10 guys that have been at the top of the game or have been around the top of the game for a long time,” said McIlroy. “Obviously, everyone’s seen the five metrics that go into it and how everyone ranked in those metrics. I feel like it’s a pretty self-explanatory system. That’s how the numbers rolled out. It’s certainly not something that I’m checking up on every week to see where I’m at but I think it went the way most of us expected it to go.” McIlroy will have Adam Scott and Sepp Straka for company over rounds one and two at Bay Hill. “This is a course that has fitted my eye from the first time I played here,” said McIlroy, who won here in 2018.
