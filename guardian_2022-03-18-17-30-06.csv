3/18/2022,"Evidence gathered in Ukraine points towards war crimes being committed and the blame lies with Vladimir Putin, a British defence minister has said, echoing Joe Biden who called the Russian leader “a war criminal”. Asked if the Russian president was indeed a war criminal, the defence minister, James Heappey, told Sky News: “I’ve not pulled my punches when I’ve been on your show. I think the evidence that is being gathered points very much towards war crimes being committed and the culpability for war crimes sits absolutely with the leader of the Russian government, the man who decided to do all this in the first place. “It’s not just Putin who ends up being responsible for war crimes as and when the evidence is gathered and people are held to account. Every single person in the military chain of command can not just hide behind the line of “they’re only following orders”, they too are involved in the prosecution of war crimes in Ukraine. This is a stain on the Russian nation.” Biden told reporters on Wednesday Putin was “a war criminal” over his country’s invasion of Ukraine, triggering outrage in Moscow, and has since followed up the comments by branding the Russian president a “murderous dictator”. The remarks came in a week when the Russians bombed a theatre in the battered port city of Mariupol that was sheltering hundreds of civilians. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in its latest update on Ukraine that Russian forces “have made minimal progress this week”. “Ukrainian forces around Kyiv and Mykolaiv continue to frustrate Russian attempts to encircle the cities. The cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remain encircled and subject to heavy Russian shelling. “The UN now states that the number of refugees fleeing the conflict in Ukraine has already surpassed 3.2 million. This number will continue to rise as a result of ongoing Russian aggression.” Heappey was asked about reports that a foreign agent had been able to call the secretary of state for defence, Ben Wallace, on a Microsoft Teams video call. Wallace is said to have become suspicious about the caller’s intentions and terminated the conversation after 10 minutes. He ordered an investigation into the security breach but there are serious questions about Whitehall security after the home secretary, Priti Patel, said she was similarly targeted last week. Heappey told Sky News: “The SoS has asked some pretty tough questions of the department as to how that was able to happen and he acknowledges it shouldn’t have done. “Ben is a guy who understands threat very well; he spent a long time as our nation’s security minister before he was promoted to secretary of state. He was acutely aware he was on Microsoft Teams call and therefore he would not ever disclose any sensitive details on a platform that could be very easily intercepted and listened in to. “The call therefore was pretty bland and when the caller started to ask more pointed questions about our intentions militarily in the region, Ben knew full well that that’s not the sort of question that anyone would normally ask on Teams, so he became pretty suspicious and terminated the call.”",News/World news,"Evidence of war crimes in Ukraine, says British defence minister",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/evidence-of-war-crimes-in-ukraine-says-british-defence-minister-putin-russia
3/18/2022,"Independent testing has found hundreds of popular personal care items in the US to be contaminated with benzene, a highly carcinogenic chemical, prompting several big brands to voluntarily recall dozens of products in recent months. The lab, Valisure, last year detected benzene in hand sanitizers, sunscreens, deodorant, dry shampoos, conditioners, antiperspirants, deodorants, body sprays and anti-fungal treatments. The contamination has been most frequently detected in aerosol or spray products, some at levels the Food and Drug Administration characterized as “life-threatening”. The findings suggest that benzene contamination is widespread and is probably in more products that have not yet been tested, said David Light, Valisure’s chief executive. “Benzene really shouldn’t be there at all,” he said. “What we’re seeing is a fundamental problem in the manufacturing of a lot of consumer products.” To date, Valisure has tested 662 items and found the chemical in 180, or about 27%, of products. Procter & Gamble, Bayer, CVS and Johnson & Johnson have issued voluntary recalls for widely distributed brands including Brut, Sure, Pantene, Herbal Essences, Old Spice, Secret, Tinactin, Lotrimin, Coppertone, Neutrogena and Aveeno. Among the recalled hand sanitizer brands are Art Naturals, Best Brands and Natural Wunderz. Light pointed to “decades of research” that has found no safe levels of benzene exposure because it’s so toxic at very low levels. The petroleum-based chemical “causes cancer”, especially leukemia and in blood forming organs, the US Department of Health and Human Services wrote. The toxin has also been shown to harm the central nervous system and reproductive organs. The US banned benzene’s use as an ingredient nearly 45 years ago, and it is “somewhat unique in that it’s pretty well established to be incredibly toxic – that’s been known for decades to over a century,” said David Andrews, senior scientist at the public health advocate Environmental Working Group. Advocates took aim at the Food and Drug Administration for failing to do more to protect the public. In a December statement, the agency said it’s investigating the situation, doing its own testing and urged companies to recall contaminated products. Though the agency lacks the authority to order recalls and may be limited in it pre-market authority to require testing, advocates are calling on the FDA to clarify an existing benzene limit, set new exposure limits, and conduct more testing of products on store shelves to ensure they are safe, instead of leaving that up to independent labs. The FDA’s system “really lacks independent review” because it relies on companies to self report, Light said. Federal rules allow benzene to be used in the manufacture of personal care products, and that can cause it to end up in goods, even if it’s not listed as an ingredient. Benzene can also be added in emergency situations, like the pandemic, or if it provides “significant therapeutic” advantages. In such scenarios, the FDA’s limit is two parts per million, but some products that provided no therapeutic advantage were found with levels as high as 21 ppm. In a statement, the FDA wrote it “continues to monitor the issue” and work with companies to recall contaminated products. Though the agency doesn’t have exposure limits, it informs companies that “solvents such as benzene should not be employed in the manufacture of drug substances, excipients, or drug products because of their unacceptable toxicity.” Some companies have capitalized on the confusing regulations and gaps to downplay the problem. Johnson & Johnson, which recalled sunscreens in July, said “daily exposure to benzene in these aerosol sunscreen products at the levels detected in our testing would not be expected to cause adverse health consequences.” The company’s statement was posted by the FDA on its website even though agency scientists found in a July analysis obtained by Consumer Reports that benzene-contaminated sunscreen did pose a “life-threatening risk”. “Is the FDA serving these companies or the public?” Andrews asked. How benzene is landing in products remains a bit of a mystery in some instances. Companies claim they aren’t adding it to their formulas, and the FDA theorized that it’s probably in contaminated thickening agents, preservatives, spray propellant or ethanol. In many cases, Valisure found one batch of a product would contain benzene while another of the same product would not. That highlights the complexities and lack of oversight in the global supply chains that produce personal care products. A propellant like butane that’s refined very early in the manufacturing process “touches dozens of different hands” in its journey from raw material to sunscreen on a shelf, yet nobody detected benzene, Light said. Valisure most frequently found benzene in body sprays, which includes deodorants and anti-perspirants: nearly half of the 108 products from 30 different brands contained it. The highest levels were found in Sure, Old Spice, Secret, Equate, Right Guard, Tag and Brut. Valisure tested nearly 300 sunscreens or after-sun products and found detectable levels in 77, or about 27%, of samples. Among those with the highest levels were Neutrogena, CVS, Sun Bum, Raw Elements and Banana Boat. Though spray-on sunscreen was found to be contaminated most frequently, the chemical was also detected in lotions and gels. Valisure’s hand sanitizer analysis found the highest levels of benzene in small brands that popped up as demand for the product spiked. Out of 260 samples from 168 brands sold on Amazon, at pharmacies and at box stores such as Target, 44, or about 17%, had detectable levels of benzene. Products from household names like Purell and Suave didn’t contain the chemical. In its December statement, TPC Hot Acquisition, which owns Brut and Sure, wrote: “To date, no reports of adverse events related to this recall have been reported. This voluntary recall is being conducted out of an abundance of caution.” However, it’s nearly impossible to legally prove that one specific chemical has caused an illness, and Andrews noted benzene has a latency period of 10 to 15 years, “The time lag between exposure and cancer can be a long period of time,” Andrews said.",News/US news,Carcinogenic chemical benzene found in hundreds of US personal care products,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/18/benzene-carcinogenic-chemical-personal-care-products-us
3/18/2022,"Richard Rapport is near to claiming one of the two remaining places in the 2022 Candidates after the Hungarian defeated Russia’s Dmitry Andreikin 1.5-0.5 in Belgrade in the second-leg final of the Fide Grand Prix. The action now moves to the third and final leg in Berlin from 21 March to 4 April, which Rapport will sit out while his rivals battle. The decisive game had a remarkable climax. Rapport had the chance for an immediate draw by repetition, but instead allowed his clock to run down to two minutes before opting for unfathomable complications which turned out in his favour. Berlin in March-April will have 16 players, four preliminary groups, and one group of death which contains Andreikin as well as the two Americans, Hikaru Nakamura and Levon Aronian, who were first and second at Berlin in February. The arithmetic shows that two of this trio will be eliminated, while the fourth player, Grigoriy Oparin, is potentially the kingmaker. Depending on what happens in the group of death, the other significant contenders – Anish Giri, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave and Leinier Domínguez – may still be in the running. However, a scenario where Oparin plays harder against the US duo than against his compatriot looks likely, and that could prove significant in a sprint distance of six rounds. The elite action moves back online this Saturday when Magnus Carlsen is top seeded in the Charity Cup, the second event in the Meltwater Champions Tour. Rapport is taking part, as are China’s world, No 3 Ding Liren, the world woman champion, Ju Wenjun, and England’s Gawain Jones. Games start at 5pm. Months further on, the 44th chess Olympiad, removed from Moscow, has been confirmed for Chennai, India, in July-August. Last weekend’s Blackpool Conference at the Imperial Hotel was England’s first major over-the-board weekend congress of 2022. Its entry of 281 was down on pre-pandemic levels, but still a healthy number as 143 took part in an overlapping rapid at Golders Green. GM Danny Gormally, rated nearly 100 points or more higher than the rest of the field at 2520, was the clear favourite for the £700 first prize, but the England No 12 misfired somewhat, conceded two draws, and had to settle for 4/5 and a seven-way tie for top honours. In this file of games from the Open, Gormally’s entertaining round-three win is recommended. Blackpool’s most significant result was away from the Open, in the Under 1850 Intermediate (ECF 150 in old money). Six-year-old Kushal Jakhria, 70th and lowest ranked at the start, took a half-point bye on Friday evening, then defeated all his four adult opponents on Saturday and Sunday for 4.5/5 and a third share of the £500 first prize. His victims were no pushovers, either. Michael Connor (round three) had won the 2018 Blackpool Inter, while Bob Kane (round four) had won the Scarborough 2021 Major. Jakhria already made an appearance in this column when he became London under-8 champion at age five. Like England’s best-known teen player Shreyas Royal, he is a pupil of the Pointer School, Blackheath, and learnt further chess skills at his local Charlton club, which has a fine reputation for junior talent. Jakhria’s coach, Fide Master Alexis Harakis, has helped his pupil become a specialist in the Sveshnikov Sicilian and on the white side of a classical King’s Indian. His Lichess online rating is already above 2200. The English Chess Federation currently runs an Accelerator Programme for 10 of its most promising players, for which one selection criterion is to be in at least the top five in their UK age group. None of the programme’s current members is younger than 11, and Royal is the only one to have achieved a high world ranking and to have medalled in a world or European championship. In the golden years of English chess, some of the most gifted talents emerged at eight or younger, like Nigel Short, Michael Adams, Luke McShane, David Howell, Jovanka Houska and others. They were given special opportunities, mentored and coached with a view to becoming GMs early in their careers, and achieved their targets. The current Fide list for players born in 2015, who all count as under-7s, shows Jakhria as world No 4, poised to reach No 2 in the April list which will include Blackpool, and within reach of No 1. The Charlton boy is not alone as a very young English talent. Harrow’s 2015-born Bodhana Sivanandan, who won silver medals in both the rapid and blitz European under-8 girls, is world No 1 girl in blitz in her age group by a whopping margin of 322 Fide points. Bodhana learned the moves only 15 months ago, attends a local state primary school, St John Fisher, and has no chess coach, although Harrow CC and its president, Nevil Chan, have provided guidance and support. It is early days, but these two children already stand out as exceptional. Jakhria’s Blackpool result is probably the best ever performance by an English six-year-old, while Sivanandan’s medals in Serbia match Houska’s fifth place on her debut in the 1988 world girls U10.

3/18/2022,"The UK’s cost of living crisis seems to escalate almost by the day. According to experts, we are facing the biggest fall in living standards since the 1970s. Announcing a phase-out of Russian oil imports, Boris Johnson spoke of “dark days ahead” – as if the days we live in were not already dark enough. This crisis cannot be blamed solely on Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. The return of high inflation may be traceable to short-term supply shocks. But the things that turn it into a crisis have been decades in the making. In the 70s, “stagflation” – low growth coupled with high inflation – put an end to three decades of rising living standards. Now, it comes on top of a lost decade. Real wages are no higher than in 2008, when the financial crisis hit. Millions of households were already struggling to make ends meet. It does not take much to tip them into the red. It is not just that wages have been squeezed: simply existing in the UK has become inordinately expensive. This is partly because we have gone further than almost anywhere else in turning essential goods and services into financial assets. Because people literally cannot do without them, owning these assets is a reliable way to extract huge rents while doing very little. By putting the means of a decent life in the hands of private gatekeepers whose only concern is to maximise their rents, we have built an economy that systematically inflates costs for consumers while also driving down wages. The most obvious and egregious example is housing. When soaring housing costs are taken into account, living standards have been falling for most working-age households since 2002. House prices have risen 20% since the start of the pandemic and are at a record high, both in absolute terms and relative to earnings. This leaves growing numbers of people trapped in the private rented sector, where about a third of their income is gobbled up by rent alone. Average rents have risen 8.6% in the past year and now stand at over £1,000 a month. This comes on top of a decade where rents already rose far faster than wages. Of course, renters’ losses are landlords’ gains. Attracted by these outsize returns, buy-to-let investors have swallowed up a substantial chunk of available homes in recent years. We see the same patterns elsewhere, from care to water, energy to transport. Britain’s childcare system is the third most expensive in the world: bad news for parents but good news for the private equity investors buying up nurseries. Meanwhile, about £1 in every £10 spent on social care is extracted from the system by highly financialised companies that own and control assets within it – contributing to an eye-watering 30% increase in costs for self-funded care since 2012. Rail fares have risen 20% in real terms since privatisation, and water bills 40% – with excess profits inflating the latter by an estimated £2.3bn a year. Meanwhile, as the thinktank Common Wealth points out, the monopoly owners of the grid are achieving 40% profit margins, and pay out over £1bn a year to shareholders. The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, recently warned against the threat of inflation caused by increasing wages. The bogeyman lurking behind the governor’s intervention was the “wage-price spiral” – whereby rising wages drive prices up further, leaving nobody better off. This plays into the idea, beloved by mainstream economists, that the interests of workers and consumers are essentially a seesaw: for one to gain, the other must lose. But this conveniently ignores the third actor in the equation: the owners. In the UK today, owners are the one group who actually have the power to set both wages and prices. Indeed, they have been systematically handed that power by decades of deregulation and trade union decline. So why did Bailey ignore them? Why, the FT commentator Martin Sandbu pondered, did he not call on powerful businesses to “moderate” their profits, rather than asking less powerful workers to “moderate” their wage demands. Perhaps, as Sandbu observes, because mainstream economics has a “blind spot” for the power of capital, and correcting this would mean asking uncomfortable questions about “who bears the cost” of rising inflation and who benefits. High energy costs may have millions wondering how they will heat their homes, but BP’s chief executive boasted unashamedly that they turn his company into a “cash machine”. BP’s and Shell’s profits soared to a combined $32bn last year, with BP shareholders standing to benefit from a $1.5bn share buyback. Demands for a windfall tax have proved popular because people intuitively understand that these enormous rewards are unearned and unfair. But even companies on the wrong end of rising input costs have significant power to decide who takes the hit: do they pass it on to customers by hiking prices, or to shareholders by squeezing margins? In the case of supermarkets, as the campaigner Jack Monroe has made clear, this effectively means power to decide whether the poorest families can afford to eat. The problem is that the companies making these life-or-death decisions recognise no duty other than to maximise investors’ returns. In France, state-owned EDF has shielded citizens from the pain of rising energy costs. In the UK, where public ownership has been systematically dismantled, we lack both the democratic levers and the political will to do the same. In the US, where corporate power is even more concentrated than in the UK, commentators warn that the real danger is not a wage-price spiral but a “profit-price spiral”. US corporate profit margins are at a 70-year high, and have risen 37% in the past year alone. In one survey, more than half of retailers admitted to raising prices by more than their increase in costs – with larger firms most likely to be doing so. The narrative about inflation offers a convenient smokescreen for fattening margins, as investors brazenly admit. In the words of one asset manager: “What we really want to find are companies with pricing power. In an inflationary environment, that’s the gift that keeps on giving.” In the face of such shameless profiteering, calls for slower wage growth are as economically wrongheaded as they are inhumane. Yes, there is a group who have been creaming off excessive rewards for decades, and who now need to tighten their belts in the face of supply shocks. But it’s not ordinary workers. As those firebrand socialists at Morgan Stanley recently argued, it’s profits that must shrink to absorb the pain of inflation – making up for decades in which capital has increased its share at the expense of workers and consumers alike. More fundamentally, we have to ask whether the UK’s world-beating experiment with privatisation has run its course. The astounding sums handed to investors might have passed unnoticed in better times. Today, this largesse is something we quite literally cannot afford.

3/18/2022,"Jerome loves Lilly and plays with her all the time, but refuses to clean up her mess In lockdown I got a kitten. It was my idea and I pushed for it. Jerome came up with every excuse under the sun not to get a cat. He said: “I don’t want our lives to change with the responsibility, and I don’t want to stay in to look after it.” I told him it would be fine. He was resistant for months, but I said lockdown would be the perfect time because we were home more. We went back and forth on the breed, the cost and where to buy a kitten. There were no cats in shelters at the time so we went to a private seller. We settled on a British shorthair kitten. Jerome was like: “Fine, but I don’t want to clean up after it; it’s your cat so that’s your job.” It was sort of a throwaway comment and a bargaining chip. I knew he’d change his mind. Jerome has grown up with cats and adores them, so I knew he wouldn’t ignore Lilly once she arrived. I was right. Jerome is a great cat parent. He’s generous with his time, playful with Lilly and showed me how to train her. We both fell in love with her immediately. Now he says, “She’s my cat. She loves me more.” But he still refuses to clean up the mess in the litter tray. I recently went away with work for a few days and he sent me loads of videos of him and Lilly playing together. That was cute, but when I got back I noticed he hadn’t cleaned her tray. Lilly had to do her business on top of what was already there. I kicked off and his response was: “I knew you’d react like this. But it’s not really my job.” I find that very lazy and irresponsible. Jerome loves Lilly and buys her luxury food and toys, but he’s very happy to risk Lilly’s life by letting her use a dirty litter box. Dirty litter trays can make the cat contract all kinds of infections, like ringworm. Plus it makes our flat smell gross. Jerome loves to tell people he has a gorgeous cat, but he can’t have it both ways. He needs to split the cat chores and clean the litter tray if he wants to claim Lilly as his own. I am sick of doing it – and I am also quite sick of his hypocrisy. I’m the fun cat daddy. We agreed before we got Lilly that the litter tray would be Erica’s job I was never 100% sold on the idea of having a cat before we got Lilly. I told Erica: “It’s your responsibility. I’m just here for the good times.” She agreed to that if it meant we could get a pet. I reinforced my stance when Lilly arrived (even though I loved her immediately), and didn’t really help out with the big jobs. In my eyes I’m doing nothing wrong by shirking the litter tray as it was part of the deal. My remit is feeding, stroking and playing with her. I’m the fun cat daddy. Erica’s remit is litter tray duties and cleaning the cat sick. That’s what was agreed. When Erica went away on a work trip I cared for Lilly very well. We had a great time together and Erica had changed the cat tray before she went. She was gone for four days and I thought it would be fine to leave that job until she returned. I wasn’t risking Lilly’s life by not changing the tray – I also took her outside to do her business, so she had a choice. I agree that it made the house smell a bit nasty – it’s just that I hate touching the box. I hate smelling poo and having to tip it all into the bin. It turns my stomach, which is why I never agreed to the role. I didn’t want to get a cat because of the responsibility. Erica sprang Lilly on me in the middle of lockdown. We were stressed, both working from home and under each other’s feet in a poky flat. Finding the right cat took ages, and it was stressful arguing with her about it. We finally agreed on Lilly, a regular shorthair. I was happy with the choice and now I love Lilly very much. I helped train her when it came to going outside and learning to use her litter tray. I’ve also got her a scratch post and a little ball and I love getting her excited by playing with those. She feels like my cat, too. I get Erica’s point that this move to joint ownership necessitates joint care. But I pay for the majority of Lilly’s vet bills, toys and food. I am still playing a very active role; I just don’t want to touch the litter tray. This is a stance I outlined from the beginning, so, if anything, I’ve been consistent. Erica needs to stick to her role in caring for Lilly and I will stick to mine. Should Jerome take his turn with the litter tray? Erica and Jerome agreed on what their roles would be before they got Lilly. Jerome has gone beyond his remit and Erica should be grateful for his love and care of Lilly, especially when he never wanted her in the first place.Julia, 54 Jerome has broken the terms of his own imaginary contract by claiming Lilly as his. As he himself asserts: your cat, your job. Time to pick up the scoop!Nina, 26 Jerome offered zero compromise and there’s no suggestion that he helps out with other things at home in return for Erica cleaning the litter tray. God forbid you ever have to take care of a human child! Either share the cat litter cleaning 50/50, or take care of something else Erica hates.Scott, 35 Erica explicitly agreed to do all the unpleasant pet tasks. The fact that she took this on with the expectation that Jerome would change his mind doesn’t mean he has betrayed her – he’s just not changed his mind.Molly, 31 I sympathise with Jerome as an initial agreement was made, but it seems that things have changed. He can’t cherry-pick the cat duties he’s prepared to do – and not cleaning the litter tray while Erica was away is unacceptable. I’m with Erica.Matthew, 25 So now you can be the judge, click on the poll below to tell us: should Jerome start cleaning the cat’s litter tray?

3/18/2022,"There are few better places to hold a preseason training camp than at Malibu’s Pepperdine University, whose football pitch seems to hover over the shimmering Pacific Ocean. It makes a memorable opening scene for Angel City FC. A typical American expansion team’s start is often rocky: Fighting for decent players, for fans, for attention, for a shred of dignity following lopsided defeats. But Angel City FC, who debut in the National Women’s Soccer League this year, are far from typical. Although they don’t play their first match until Saturday in the NWSL Challenge Cup, things already look quite different around here. The team’s female-led ownership group includes a mind-boggling roll call of A-list movie stars, legendary athletes and retired USWNT greats. The group raised capital like a startup tech company, with funding rounds that attracted more stars along the way. The team will play in the luxurious Banc of California Stadium in Los Angeles. From the get-go, the club has been strongly vocal about its values of community and female empowerment. And the buzz is palpable: Angel City FC has sold more than 14,000 season tickets so far and boasts seven supporters groups. The operation seems to have “blockbuster” written all over it. But the founders say all that glamour exists solely to advance the club’s goals and values. In fact, it’s the reason Angel City FC was created. In April 2019, Natalie Portman attended a USWNT match with her friends Jennifer Garner, Eva Longoria, Uzo Aduba and Jessica Chastain. Portman, a founding member of Time’s Up, sought to bring attention to the fight for equal pay by the US women’s team. Later, as Portman watched the Women’s World Cup that summer, she was enthralled by the way the American players’ personalities and mission seemed to converge. “Watching my son idolize players like Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan the same way he did Lionel Messi or Karim Benzema, I realized that amplifying female athletes could rapidly shift culture,” Portman tells the Guardian by email. But Portman was bothered by the fact that even top female footballers often have no retirement plan and little to live on when they quit the game, unlike their male counterparts. Abby Wambach and others spoke about this at a Time’s Up conference. “Much of [Wambach’s] speech inspired us to create a different model,” Portman explains. Portman says she didn’t play or watch sports growing up, And, unlike your average fan, she never secretly dreamed about controlling a team herself. But that’s what she decided to do: She would start a team that would be everything she wanted to see women’s soccer become. Portman shared her idea with Kara Nortman, a venture capital executive in LA who was also involved in Time’s Up. Nortman regularly played basketball with a tech executive named Julie Uhrman, and one day Nortman put the question to Uhrman: Could she help figure out how to build a team? The timing was right. Worldwide, women are making strides in sports leadership positions. And opportunity beckoned: Los Angeles didn’t have a women’s professional football team. Wambach and Alexis Ohanian – Reddit co-founder and husband of Serena Williams – became initial investors. Soon after, the stars continued to align … pun not intended. Longoria, Garner, Aduba and Chastain became co-owners. The ownership group now includes (deep breath): retired football legends Julie Foudy, Mia Hamm, Shannon McMillan, Rachel Van Hollebeke and others; Billie Jean King, Sophia Bush, Serena Williams, James Corden, Christina Aguilera, Rachel Zoe, NHL star PK Subban, gold-medal-winning gymnast Shawn Johnson East, Cobi Jones, and Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade and their three-year-old daughter. In all, Angel City FC has more than 60 co-owners – two-thirds of whom are women. “It got to the point where we didn’t have to seek investors,” Uhrman, the team’s co-founder and president, says. “They came to us because they wanted to be a part of Angel City, and understood the role they would have to play as an investor. That makes the best type of owner, because they care both about the purpose side and the profit side.” The purpose side includes a players’ fund and ensuring that athlete safety and fair treatment are the driving factors for all decisions. Portman says that through the club’s partnerships with sponsors, they’ve planted seven gardens at local elementary schools, donated sports bras to young players and delivered thousands of meals to the hungry. Angel City puts 10% of sponsorship revenue back into the community. And about that profit side: Uhrman recently announced the club earned $35m in sponsorship, a figure which dwarfs that of other NWSL teams. The team’s majority-female hierarchy feels especially significant following last year’s NWSL harassment scandal. “It’s huge,” Foudy explains in an email. “It’s a completely different mindset and approach. Instead of feeling like we should just be grateful to have a league, and accept things as they are (as it always has been for me and my generation), Angel City approaches all decisions with this mentality of, ‘How can we build this into something amazing for the players and for our community?’ It is so refreshing, honestly.” The club’s sporting director is retired England striker (and former Guardian columnist) Eni Aluko. Her first hire involved persuading fellow Englishwoman Freya Coombe to leave New York/New Jersey’s Gotham FC and become Angel City’s head coach. Hours after announcing Coombe’s role in August, Angel City confirmed their first signing: two-time World Cup-winning striker Christen Press – a native Angeleno from Palos Verdes. Press’ Angel City FC contract made her the highest-paid player in league history. The club’s 24-woman roster includes various players picked up in the expansion draft, plus college draft selections and signings from overseas. Standout additions include Sarah Gorden in defense and goalkeeper DiDi Haracic, who played for Coombe at NJ/NY Gotham FC. Yet how well the pieces will fit together is difficult to answer. “This league is incredible to watch because on any given day, any team can beat any other team,” says Marisa Pilla, an NWSL commentator for CBS Sports. “It’s hard to be a standout expansion club, but I think [Angel City] will be a competitive team this year. I think they’ll be in the playoff race.” With all the stardust surrounding Angel City and the values the club wears on its sleeve, the team will no doubt have a big target on their backs in the league. But club officials seem self-assuredly laidback about it in a very Californian way. “We’ve been building Angel City FC with the idea that we want to entertain the world,” Uhrman says. “We come from Los Angeles, we’re all storytellers, so we take on that challenge as a given for what we want to accomplish.” And besides, even early setbacks have turned out all right. The players actually weren’t supposed to train at Pepperdine; Angel City’s training ground is at Cal Lutheran University – where the NFL’s Los Angeles Rams also work out. But the Rams’ playoff run forced Angel City to temporarily relocate. Angel City officials are obviously hoping some of the Rams’ Super Bowl-winning mojo will linger as they move in. But more than winning, the ultimate goal is giving players exposure – the coin of the realm in this part of the world – and all of its knock-on effects. “Our dream is to make women’s soccer as valued as male soccer is throughout the world,” Portman explains.",Sport/Football,Natalie Portman wanted to shift football culture.

3/18/2022,"Nature documentaries tend to fall into one of two camps. Either they seek to awe us with the splendour and richness of the natural world, or they sound the alarm about how human activity is jeopardising that splendour and richness. It’s a tricky balance: you are in danger of serving up visual wallpaper or beating your audience over the head for not doing enough, even as you ask them to do nothing more than sit and watch a film. Faced with this dilemma, River seeks to do both. On the one hand, it delivers stunning landscape visuals that demand to be seen on the largest possible screen, enhanced by a stirring score from the Australian Chamber Orchestra, indigenous singer William Barton, Jonny Greenwood and Radiohead. There are riverscapes of every description, from every corner of the world and at every scale, from fine grains of silt to satellite images that resemble abstract art. There are also moments of white-knuckle action, such as an unbelievably long drone shot careering down a glacier as it transitions into a raging river to a rousing Bach accompaniment. But – and river metaphors are almost impossible to avoid here – River has a direction and a destination. As well as the physical reality of rivers, the film charts humanity’s evolving relationships with them, “from mystery to mastery to almost an amnesia”, as the writer Robert Macfarlane puts it. His sparse, reflective prose is recited by Willem Dafoe, with his trademarked gravelly gravitas. The film also delivers some mind-blowing facts: China’s Three Gorges dam, we are told, is so vast, it has actually slowed the speed of the Earth’s rotation, to the extent our day is now 0.06 microseconds longer. “That line between sentimentality and polemic – that was the constant topic of conversation in the edit,” says Jennifer Peedom, River’s co-director and driving force. She can’t really classify her film or, in fact, herself. “There are plenty of amazing activist film-makers out there, and it’s just not what I do,” she says from her home in Sydney. “There are also a lot of amazing video artists out there, but I’m not one of them.” She hesitates to even call herself a director, describing her role as more like a “conductor”, bringing together a team of extraordinary collaborators. The formula was set with River’s predecessor: Mountain, which examined humankind’s obsession with mountaineering through a similar mix of the scenic and the cerebral. Mountain began as a commission for a concert movie by the Australian Chamber Orchestra (and its conductor, Richard Tognetti). They approached Peedom on the strength of her previous films, especially 2015’s Sherpa, a critique of the Everest-climbing industry, filmed during what turned out to be one of the worst disasters in the mountain’s history. “I saw it as a really interesting creative challenge,” says Peedom of the ACO’s commission, “But I said: ‘If we’re going to do this, I wanted to make something that would work in the cinema.’” That’s when Peedom turned to Macfarlane, whose 2003 book Mountains of the Mind she had read enthusiastically. “She just approached me out of the blue and said: ‘I read this book and I want to make a film about all that it says and more besides,’” Macfarlane recalls. He couldn’t refuse, even if it meant paring down his 320-page book to an 800-word script. “It did feel, at times, like climbing a very exposed route in the mountains,” he says. It was a similar story with Dafoe. Peedom didn’t know the actor; she just loved his work and his voice, and had a sense that he would appreciate what they were trying to do. “The footage was stunning and the text compelling,” says Dafoe. “It was an unusual project and as a climber, Jen had a personal connection to mountains.” Peedom is as intrepid physically as she is creatively. Most of her work to date has involved mountaineering and other perilous pursuits. “I climbed above 8,000m probably three years in a row,” she says, casually, at one point, “but even then I wouldn’t have called myself a mountaineer.” She grew up in an “outdoorsy” family near Canberra, she explains: cross-country skiing, rock climbing, swimming. When she was starting out, she happened to move in with a house full of New Zealander mountaineers. “I ended up just getting a foot in the door in that world and then discovered that my body worked really well at altitude. I had good endurance; I used to be a runner and a triathlete. And I had the camera operating skills, so that’s sort of how I began my film-making career.” Now that she has a family she doesn’t put herself in danger so much, she says. Although the last time she said that was just before she went off and made Sherpa. “I didn’t go higher than base camp, but then the very next year, exactly where my camp was got swept away by an avalanche.” Mountain became the highest-grossing Australian documentary of all time, so River was really a case of getting the team back together. But some things were different. On a practical level, the week after the team were ready to get going, Covid struck, and Australians were unable to travel for what would turn out to be nearly two years. “We made the whole film barely leaving the edit suite,” says Peedom. Fortunately, there is now a global community of dedicated landscape film-makers whom she and River’s co-director, Joseph Nizeti, could call on. Amateurs and professionals (including French aerial specialist Yann Arthus-Bertrand) contributed existing material or shot new footage for them. That spectacular shot tumbling down the glacier, for example, was the work of a young drone cameraman, Ralph Hogenbirk, in Norway. “The skill and the quality of drone piloting in the years between making Mountain and River had just gone off the scale,” says Peedom. “It takes a huge amount of practice to get that good. They practise and they crash, and they practise more.” This one got his drone back at the end, she reassures me. There was another big difference this time round: subject-wise, mountains and rivers are not at all the same. While mountains are relatively remote, inert and indestructible, rivers are the opposite. “Rivers run through us,” says Macfarlane. Human civilisation began with them – Mesopotamia literally means “between two rivers”, most of the world’s cities are built on their banks and now, of course, human activity threatens them. “A river is an easily injured, even easily killed, thing,” says Macfarlane. “There’s that WH Auden line from 1953: ‘A culture is no better than its woods’. Right now, it feels like a culture is no better than its rivers.” Dafoe agrees: “I grew up in a paper-mill town on the Fox River in Wisconsin, USA. It was horribly polluted and when I fished there as a kid you would catch inedible fish often, with mutations and deformations.” A clean-up operation on the Fox has been going on since the 1970s but contamination levels are still high. “Certainly, as I grow older, you see things from your childhood that you assumed were indestructible or renewable become destroyed or compromised,” says Dafoe. “Until we change, we are all just whistling as we pass the graveyard.” River finds some hopeful notes to end on, however. Not least the subject of dams, which affect far more than just the Earth’s rotation. They can be beneficial in regulating water supply and generating electricity, but they block off nutrient-rich silt, causing economic and ecological harm further downstream. “Dams achieve what should be impossible; they drown rivers,” as the film puts it. In the developed world at least, the wisdom of using dams is now being reconsidered, and River includes some spectacular footage of dams in Colorado and Estonia being destroyed. “The good side is that a river heals itself incredibly quickly,” says Macfarlane. “Life’s readiness to pour back, in a riverine context, is really exciting. And we saw that again and again.” As well as providing mind-boggling visuals, dam destruction could be a metaphor for where humanity’s relationship with nature is at right now. Beyond immediate environmental concerns, River is a plea for “thinking like a river”, as Macfarlane puts it, in the sense of “downstream, deeper-time, responsibility-taking” in the long term. Macfarlane has supported numerous campaigns for river health and access personally, including a declaration of rights for the River Cam last year. “As the broader political context around rivers suggests, that agitation is happening and has to happen.” This is where culture has a role to play, although if a film-maker hopes to reach a substantial audience with an environmentally themed documentary, there are rapids to navigate, political as well as commercial. “The conscious decision I’ve made in my work is to tread lightly,” says Peedom. “Because we live in such divisive times, the minute you get a little bit too political you might have lost half the audience. The idea is to give an audience an encounter with nature that just shifts their understanding in some small way, and might just cause them to think differently.” River is in cinemas from today",Arts/Film,‘Rivers run through us’: Willem Dafoe and Robert Macfarlane on why they made a film of the world’s great waterways,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/18/rivers-run-through-us-willem-dafoe-and-robert-macfarlane-on-why-they-made-a-film-of-the-worlds-great-waterways
3/18/2022,"For five years, Frederick Chukwuemeze had the grim task of treating children poisoned by lead in Anka, a mining town in north-west Nigeria. Since 2010, more than 600 children have died from lead poisoning in Zamfara state and hundreds more have been left with brain damage and physical disabilities as a result of hazardous artisanal gold mining. “I’ve seen patients with continuous seizures that couldn’t be controlled with any medication. Children that can’t talk, can’t walk. Always in bed, not knowing where they are. And then, of course, children dying. It’s actually heartbreaking when we see such cases,” said Chukwuemeze. But no child has died on his watch since October last year, thanks to a joint effort between local and international agencies that has virtually wiped out lead poisoning cases in the state. “It’s a wonderful accomplishment – for the patients and for me,” said Chukwuemeze, who works with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which was involved in the clean-up operation. The huge effort followed an outbreak of lead poisoning in at least seven villages in Zamfara in 2010. Over six months, 400 children died in a crisis that sent shockwaves throughout the country and brought into sharp focus the dangers of mineral processing in a largely impoverished and rural area. The intervening years have seen more deaths and hundreds of poisoning cases, including children who have been left with brain damage and physical disabilities. Alhaji Muhammadu Bello, the head of Dareta village, said that at the height of the crisis: “In my village, 120 children died. Six or seven were dying every day.” The cause of the poisoning was found to be contamination of soil, water and food from the processing of gold deposits in village homes and residential areas. Artisanal – small-scale – mining is a source of income for many in Zamfara, a mineral-rich state, and many children who are out of school in the region are involved. In response, MSF joined forces with OK International, an organisation specialising in occupational and industrial health, and TerraGraphics International Foundation, an environmental engineering group, to work with Zamfara state health, environmental and other government officials to devise a long-term programme to reduce lead poisoning. Their task was not made any easier in villages regularly overrun by militants and inaccessible to aid. After an intensive monitoring programme, more than 8,000 children in affected mining communities have been screened by MSF and state health officials, and more than 3,500 have been through lengthy chelation therapy to remove lead deposits from their blood. A “safer mining” programme has seen more than 5,000 miners and community workers trained on improved standards to prevent exposure to lead, and designated processing sites – with showers – have been set up 2 to 3 miles away from residential areas to prevent miners bringing mineral deposits home. As a result, no child has died of lead poisoning this year, and cases are now rare. “Each of the village heads and council leaders have the responsibility to ensure that people aren’t bringing mining processing home but processing in designated areas for every village,” said Benjamin Mwangombe, MSF’s project coordinator in Zamfara. Alhaji Shehu Anka, the head of Zamfara state’s environmental sanitation agency, said excavation work removed waste from soil and mineral processing left in wells and ponds. “The mining activities had really damaged the local environment so we had to undertake a major effort to restore the environment and make it safe,” he said. “Because of the security challenges we were doing some of this environmental work and environmental training remotely. We used to invite miners that come from those villages. Then collect soil samples from the homes of children that are not responding to treatment, then they would remediate the environment themselves,” he added. Mwangombe said the success of the project, which was now being handed over to the Zamfara state government to lead, was due to the engagement of the communities and local and state officials. “We realised the reason the outbreak happened was because people brought mineral processing to the villages. People didn’t have any knowledge on how to mine safely. Now we believe there is a good level of behavioural change,” he said.",News/Global development,‘A wonderful accomplishment’: success for cleanup of Nigeria’s deadly lead pollution,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/18/nigeria-child-gold-miners-lead-poisoning
