2/14/2022,"The mother of a German-born Guantánamo Bay detainee held at the camp for six years and tortured has said she is still waiting for an apology or compensation as a new film sheds light on a story she says remains an “open wound”. In Rabiye Kurnaz vs George W Bush,which premiered at the Berlin film festival on Saturday, the director, Andreas Dresen, whose socially engaged film-making has led him to be described as Germany’s answer to Ken Loach, revisits the case of Murat Kurnaz, who was arrested without explanation in Pakistan in October 2001, a month after the 9/11 attacks.  Kurnaz, a Turkish citizen born and raised in Bremen who says he had travelled to Lahore to study the Qur’an at a school affiliated with the ultra-orthodox Tablighi Jamaat missionary movement, was handed over to the US even though he had no ties to al-Qaida nor had he visited a terrorist camp. He spent 1,600 days enduring various forms of torture at Guantánamo. Kurnaz plays a walk-on part in the film but its focus is on the story of his mother, Rabiye – played by comedian Meltem Kaptan – and Bernhard Docke (Alexander Scheer), the lawyer she won over to fight for her son’s release. Aided by the British actor and activist Vanessa Redgrave, Kurnaz became one of the prominent faces of a class-action suit in the US that eventually won her son the right to legal representation from the supreme court. Fifteen years after Kurnaz was reunited with her son in August 2006, her lawyer has said the blame for his client’s miscarriage still lies above all with the US. “President George W Bush set up an offshore legal vacuum in the Caribbean and destroyed all the procedural safeguards the western world has known since the age of Enlightenment,” Docke told the Guardian in an interview. Prisoners at Guantánamo Bay were held as “enemy combatants”. “They were treated like outlaws in the middle ages,” said Docke. “Because they rejected our laws, the argument went, they did not deserve the protection of our legal system either.” Thirty-nine prisoners remain in the camp, more than 20 years after it first opened. Kurnaz, however, also places blame for her son’s ordeal with the country she has lived in since she was 14. “I hold the German government responsible for what happened,” she told the Guardian. “They should have acted more quickly. After all, Murat was born here.” Three German intelligence agents interrogated Kurnaz at Guantánamo a year into his detention and came to the conclusion he was innocent and did not pose a threat to national security. According to cables cited by the news magazine Der Spiegel, neither the Pentagon nor the CIA objected to the idea of releasing Kurnaz to Germany, but the Social Democrat-Green German government in power at the time did not act and the then 20-year-old continued to be subjected to torture at the camp. “Instead of using that chance for a humanitarian act, to help Murat Kurnaz escape torture and give him a fair trial, Germany rejected the US offer and withdrew his rights to residency and return,” said Docke. “Germany wasn’t responsible for Kurnaz’s torture, but it was responsible for his malady lasting a lot longer than it should have. This guilt has not been recognised in any way.” Frank-Walter Steinmeier, re-elected as Germany’s largely ceremonial president on Sunday, was chief of staff at the German chancellory at the time and thus tasked with coordinating ties between the country’s domestic and foreign intelligence agencies. According to Der Spiegel, Berlin conveyed to Washington in November 2002 its “express wish” that Kurnaz would not be returned to Germany. In 2007, Steinmeier denied there had been an “official offer” from the US, while stating it was right to consider the Guantánamo detainee a security risk at the time. “Steinmeier has a dark stain on his conscience, and he doesn’t have the decency to admit it,” said Docke. “As president, you are meant to have moral authority, and in my view he is not up to that job if he doesn’t correct the mistakes of the past.” Kurnaz said she remained grateful to the former German chancellor Angela Merkel, under whose tenure Murat was released. “Merkel brought my child back to Germany. For me, she was the best.” The pair also criticised the Turkish government, which had taken in other Guantánamo internees and monitored Kurnaz’s case but failed to engage itself for his release. It was quick to rediscover Kurnaz as one of its citizens after he returned to Germany. “One day after he had returned to Bremen, there was a letter from the Turkish consulate … reprimanding him for not doing his obligatory military service,” said Docke. Rabiye Kurnaz vs George W Bush gains comic mileage by playing up the cultural differences between the housewife-lawyer pair from northern Germany: Docke zips between court dates on a rusty old bike, while Kurnaz roars around Bremen in a wide Mercedes Benz, her tires ever screeching. “The Germans are smart but slow,” her character tells a friend in the film. “You know the saying: ‘Start it like a Turk, but finish it like a German.’” In real life, the pair said, they were less of a study in contrasts, Docke’s law firm a bit less provincial and with more expertise in the US justice system, and Kurnaz’s apartment a bit more tidy. One of the film’s best comic moments, however, was real, they both confirm. After Murat Kurnaz’s return to Germany had eventually been secured, his mother and lawyer were to announce their triumph at a press conference. But with minutes to go, Rabiye was nowhere to be found. Her mission on the global stage complete, she had reassumed her maternal role and gone shopping to find new clothes for her son instead. “We were so annoyed at the time, but afterwards we couldn’t stop laughing,” said Docke. Murat Kurnaz, who now works with young people as a social worker at an outdoor sports centre in Bremen, had seen the film and enjoyed it, his mother said. But she said she struggled to join in the laughter during the screening. “It took me right back to that time, and sometimes that made it difficult to laugh. But a smile, yes, maybe I can smile about it sometimes.”",News/US news,Mother of Guantánamo detainee ‘still waiting’ for US and German apologies,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/13/rabiye-kurnaz-mother-guantanamo-torture-victim-murat-still-waiting-us-apology
2/14/2022,"Milan climbed to the top of the Serie A table with a 1-0 win over Sampdoria on Sunday, as an eighth-minute strike from the in-form Rafael Leão proved decisive at San Siro. The Portugal forward collected a long clearance from keeper Mike Maignan, skipped past his marker and found the bottom corner from a narrow angle to score his 10th goal of the season in all competitions.  Samp goalkeeper Wladimiro Falcone kept the deficit down to one with a string of fine stops, palming over a fierce Junior Messias strike on the stroke of half-time before blocking an acrobatic Olivier Giroud effort after the break. Falcone denied Giroud again from a header and also saved Ante Rebic’s shot, but the visitors could not threaten Maignan’s goal. The result completed a superb week for Stefano Pioli’s side, in which they defeated Internazionale in the Milan derby and hammered Lazio 4-0 in the Coppa Italia quarter-finals. It was an unhappy return for the Samp coach and former Milan manager, Marco Giampaolo, whose side remained 16th and in relegation trouble. “We can call it a perfect week because you can’t do better than this,” Milan midfielder Sandro Tonali told Dazn. “We are proud and satisfied but we won’t rest on our laurels because that would be stupid. We need to reset everything and continue along this path.” Milan move ahead of Inter and Napoli, who drew 1-1 in Naples on Saturday. Inter are one point behind with a game in hand with Napoli two points back in third place. Atalanta, currently in fifth, host fourth-placed Juventus later on Sunday. Elsewhere, Alavés revived their bid for La Liga survival with a 2-1 home win over mid-table Valencia, who are now winless in six league games. The hosts kicked off six points adrift of safety but took an early lead through Senegal midfielder Mamadou Loum, who poked home the rebound after Gonzalo Escalante’s header was saved. Valencia levelled from the penalty spot just after the hour mark, Gonçalo Guedes converting the spot-kick after the VAR spotted a handball in the penalty area. Alavés then won a penalty of their own in the 76th minute and Joselu sent Valencia keeper Giorgi Mamardashvili the wrong way to earn a vital win. In Ligue 1’s early kick-off, Lorient boosted their hopes of beating the drop with a 0-0 draw at Monaco.

2/14/2022,"Perhaps Alt-J don’t get enough respect for their creative promiscuity. Joe Newman’s choirboy croon is so distinctive, often cooing an incomprehensible plaint while sparsely arrayed instruments cluck in sorrowful sympathy, that their songs’ ambitions can be unfairly overlooked. There’s nothing as startling on this fourth album as 2018’s impressive sally into hip-hop, Deadcrush remix, but The Dream proves how good they’ve become at seeding American music such as blues, funk and house into their typically English choral, classical and folky forms. Perhaps this is a largely commercial decision – it’s the bluesy Left Hand Free that got them into the US charts, rather than delicate delights Taro or Tessellate. Either way, The Dream is another enjoyable stroll around the band’s latest curiosity shop. Crypto cowboys get called out on perky Hard Drive Gold, and there’s some extravagant wordplay on U&ME. Yet death also hangs over the album, with murder ballad Happier When You’re Gone and the intense Get Better, one of their most painfully direct and emotional songs yet, about watching someone slip slowly away in Covid times. Technically proficient, beautifully sung and lyrically acute, it exemplifies what The Dream does so well.

2/14/2022,"Caroline Weir’s late strike from distance earned Manchester City a 1-0 win over derby rivals Manchester United and a crucial three points in the race for Champions League football. Weir’s 81st minute goal in front of a club record home crowd of 5,317 moves City to within two points of third-place United and capped off a dominant performance against their neighbours.  After City’s first run of back-to-back league wins in this season, winning four on the trot from 20th November, the two points dropped as a result of Tobin Heath’s 90th-minute equaliser for Arsenal and a 1-0 defeat against Chelsea had ruptured the momentum of Taylor’s side. The title may now look beyond them, but the improvement of the team since the lessening of an injury crisis that disrupted the team’s opening fixtures has been clear. As the sides spread out before kick-off, an upbeat Ellen White walked towards the stands, geeing up the sold-out crowd. To maintain hopes of a top-three finish and a place in the Champions League a win in this game was sorely needed. Five points separated the two Manchester teams prior to kick off, with United in third and City in sixth. Even a draw would have been hugely damaging for the home team, with Reading and Tottenham between them as well as third-placed United, both with games still to play. United are also a different beast, having found their rhythm under the manager Marc Skinner. At the Academy Stadium, though, United were without the influential winger Leah Galton and, for a second weekend, the centre-back Aoife Mannion. The new recruit Diane Caldwell, making her second start in Mannion’s place, and right back Ona Batlle struggled to contain the constant threat presented by City winger Lauren Hemp, the relationship between the centre back and fullback perhaps a little too new. It did not take long for the England forward to get the better of the usually impressive Batlle. In the seventh minute she beat the Spanish defender on the left and the ball was worked out to the right before being swung back towards her by Demi Stokes but Hemp sent her shot flying over the bar from a few yards out and with the goal gaping. There was more hesitancy to United, with perhaps the less established back four and a fear of conceding preventing their usual swaggering forward play. However, with four points between themselves and second-place Chelsea, and six between them and the league leaders Arsenal, maintaining a foot in the title race will be hard with nothing taken from the game. Despite the stakes, City looked the more threatening side, with United’s forward three starved of the ball as City pressed high and hard, winning every second ball. Jess Park went close to putting them ahead just past the hour mark when she smacked a shot off the bottom of the post. In the 81st minute they took a deserved lead, with substitute Weir continuing the harrying press to rob Katie Zelem and Hayley Ladd before chipping her 25-yard effort beyond the goalkeeper Mary Earps and into the far corner.",Sport/Football,Caroline Weir’s sublime chip seals WSL derby win for Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/13/manchester-city-manchester-united-wsl-match-report
2/14/2022,"Vincent van Gogh is perhaps equally famous for his sunflowers and his act of self-mutilation. Apart from his paintings, when people think of the artist, they also think of his ear – or lack of it. But references to Van Gogh’s missing ear, and mental health, in souvenirs on sale at the Courtauld Gallery in London have attracted criticism.  Currently displaying a major exhibition of his work, including his infamous self-portrait with bandaged ear, some of the Courtauld’s products – such as a £6 eraser in the shape of an ear – have been branded insensitive. The range to celebrate Van Gogh features sunflowers aplenty, on socks, scarfs, and in packs of seeds, as well as jigsaw, postcard and print mementoes of his best-known self-portraits. But critics have attacked gift shop items highlighting the severe mental health crisis Van Gogh experienced, and which culminated in his suicide. By cutting off his left ear, after a row with fellow artist Paul Gauguin, the Dutch painter became a legendary “tortured artist”. Apart from the eraser ear, visitors can buy a £5 bar of soap, marketed as ideal for “the tortured artist who enjoys fluffy bubbles”. An “emotional first aid kit”, priced at £16, is described as “a box of wise emergency advice for 20 key psychological situations”. Some have been left distinctly unimpressed at the attempt at humour. Charles Thomson, a co-founder of the Stuckist group of artists, said: “Suicide is not a joke and mental illness is not a joke.” “This is shallow, nasty and insensitive,” he told the Mail on Sunday. “What next? Van Gogh’s suicide pistol?” Art critic David Lee, the editor of The Jackdaw magazine, told the newspaper: “I can’t believe this isn’t someone in marketing’s attempt at tasteless humour in the pub after work.” “Would they, for example, be prepared to sell pencils in the shape of a false leg at a Frida Kahlo exhibition?” he added, referring to the Mexican artist who lost a leg to gangrene. Van Gogh, a heavy drinker, is thought to have been experiencing psychosis when he cut off his ear in 1888 while living in France, after a row with Gauguin. Thought to have had either bipolar disorder or temporal lobe epilepsy, he spent more than a year at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Remy, and in 1890, aged 37, shot himself, dying two days later.

2/14/2022,"Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, has cut short a half-term holiday overseas with his family after one day because of concerns about a possible imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine. Wallace had been in continental Europe with his wife and children after talks in Moscow on Friday, but will return, he announced in a tweet.  “Having returned from Moscow early on Saturday morning and because we are concerned about the worsening situation in Ukraine I have cancelled a planned long weekend abroad with my family and will be returning,” he said. A senior defence source said Wallace had been on the trip, at an undisclosed location, but was heading back to the UK. They said: “As events worsen the secretary of state has cut short a planned long weekend with his children for half-term.” Wallace’s discussions last week with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, appeared to deliver little, with Shoigu describing levels of cooperation with Britain as “close to zero” and criticising the UK’s supply of arms to Ukraine. Their talks came a day after a similarly frosty encounter in Moscow between Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who characterised the pair’s talks as a discussion of the “mute with the deaf”. The idea of ministerial holidays amid international crises is a particularly sensitive one in Boris Johnson’s government following intense criticism of the then foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, for remaining on a family holiday in Crete in August while the Afghan government collapsed. Raab declined to be contacted about some government business while on holiday, sources said, and handed over decisions to a junior minister in the days leading up to the Taliban’s takeover. Raab said he had stayed in touch with decisions at all times, but did accept he told another minister to make a call to assist in the evacuation of former British military translators. He resisted calls to quit, but was demoted to justice secretary in a reshuffle the next month, while keeping his largely courtesy title of deputy prime minister. In December, a Foreign Office whistleblower provided a statement to MPs describing what he said were chaotic scenes in London even after Raab returned, saying he took “hours to engage” with critical evacuation cases, before requesting the files be submitted in a different spreadsheet format.",News/Politics,UK defence secretary cuts short holiday as Ukraine crisis deepens,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/13/uk-defence-minister-ben-wallace-cuts-short-holiday-as-ukraine-crisis-deepens
2/14/2022,"Olaf Scholz will use his trip to Moscow on Tuesday to press home the economic cost of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, German government sources have said in what some European leaders fear could be a last opportunity to defuse the “extremely dangerous” situation on the border between the two eastern countries. Scholz, who has faced criticism at home for cutting a low-key profile in the diplomatic effort around the military buildup on the Ukrainian border until now, will travel to Kyiv on Monday to meet the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, followed by a meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow.  US intelligence over the weekend claimed Russia had accelerated plans for an invasion of Ukraine and could move troops across the border as soon as Wednesday, before the end of the winter Olympics on 20 February. Russia, which has concentrated more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border and launched a series of military manoeuvres in the region, denies any plans for an invasion. German government circles on Sunday talked of a “very worrying overall picture” on the Ukrainian border but rejected the suggestion that Scholz’s trip represented a “last attempt” at averting a war. In Moscow, the sources said, Scholz would press home the “unity of the EU, the US and Great Britain” when it came to economic sanctions in response to an invasion. The US president, Joe Biden, has said a Russian invasion of Ukraine would spell the end of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Germany and Russia, something Scholz has been more reluctant to spell out. The gas pipeline, which would circumvent Ukraine and the Baltic states, has been completed but not yet approved. Russian diplomats have shown themselves unimpressed with threats of western sanctions, however. The Kremlin’s ambassador to Sweden told a Swedish newspaper his country “doesn’t give a shit” about economic repercussions. “Excuse my language, but we don’t give a shit about all their sanctions”, Viktor Tatarintsev told the Aftonbladet newspaper in an interview posted on its website on Saturday evening. “We have already had so many sanctions and in that sense they’ve had a positive effect on our economy and agriculture,” said the veteran diplomat. “We are more self-sufficient and have been able to increase our exports. We have no Italian or Swiss cheeses, but we’ve learned to make just as good Russian cheeses using Italian and Swiss recipes”, he said. “New sanctions are nothing positive but not as bad as the west makes it sound”, he added. Scholz’s options for offering Putin concessions during his trip to Moscow are limited. The Russian president is demanding “security guarantees” from the west, which would effectively undermine the sovereignty of independent states in east-central Europe and the Baltics. German government sources said on Sunday Scholz would offer Putin a dialogue and seek to find out more what Russia’s “security needs” entailed. The broadsheet Die Welt reported on Sunday that the German chancellor could remind his Russian counterpart that Ukraine joining Nato is not a realistic prospect in the near future. Ukraine has expressed an interest in joining Nato since 2002, but the process has repeatedly stalled and is considered unrealistic since all of the members of the military alliance must unanimously approve a new country, based on factors such as a functioning democracy and “unresolved external territorial disputes”. A compromise whereby Russia would be assured that Ukraine would not join Nato “in the next 10 years”, reported Die Welt, had been discussed in Scholz’s circles as a “thought experiment”, though not as a concrete plan. Any symbolic concession would probably face criticism from the Ukrainian side, whose ambassador in Berlin on Sunday accused the German government of “hypocrisy” over sticking to its restrictive stance on exporting lethal weapons, while continuing to supply Russia with dual-use goods that can be used for arms production. As recently as 2020, Germany exported such goods worth €366m (£306m) to Russia. Germany’s vice-chancellor and economy minister said on Sunday that “we could be on the verge of a war in Europe”. “It is absolutely oppressive and threatening”, the Green politician Robert Habeck told broadcaster NTV. He said Scholz’s trip was an important sign: “We won’t leave Ukraine alone.” Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, told German tabloid Bild am Sonntag an invasion of Ukraine would be only the start of a campaign of Russian aggression that would also threaten states in the Baltics. “If Olaf Scholz and other leaders of state speak to Vladimir Putin now, they should make clear to him: our entire country will defend itself against an attack and it will have serious consequences”, said the former boxer Klitschko, who spent a large part of his professional career in Germany. During his trip to Kyiv, Scholz will talk to the Ukrainian president about ways in which Germany could help stabilise Ukraine’s economy after fears of an imminent war have taken a toll on the country’s currency. Such measures would provide more immediate help to the Ukrainian side than any arms exports, German government circles said on Sunday.",News/World news,German leader to head to Moscow amid fears time is running out,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/13/german-leader-moscow-russia-ukraine-olaf-scholz
2/14/2022,"It wasn’t the sort of coverage Sajid Javid was hoping for. “Is that all we get for £12bn?” thundered the front page of Wednesday’s Daily Mail. The source of its frustration was the health secretary’s admission in the Commons 24 hours earlier that the length of the waiting list for hospital care in England, which now stands at a record 6.1 million people, would continue its relentless rise until March 2024. Javid’s candour came while he was launching NHS England’s “elective recovery plan”, its strategy – endorsed by the government – for addressing and, it is hoped, ultimately reducing that colossal backlog of care. The £12bn a year the forthcoming 1.25% rise in National Insurance will raise via the new health and social care levy will help fund the work involved. The plan itself is a classically NHS document: 49 pages featuring a blizzard of statistics, examples of hospitals using innovative ways of reducing patients’ waiting times for care and a raft of detailed proposals aimed at “increasing health service capacity ... prioritising diagnosis and treatment ... [and] transforming the way we provide elective care”. However, the bits of most relevance – politically for ministers and practically for patients – are the targets setting out when indecently, sometimes dangerously long, and historically unprecedented, delays for treatment – for new hips and knees, cancer care, heart operations and much else besides – will finally end. Under the NHS constitution patients have a “right” – now often merely theoretical – to receive such care within 18 weeks.  The key targets – which are really just aspirations – include ensuring that by July no one has been waiting more than two years, 18-month waits are eradicated by March next year and one-year waits – 306,996 patients have recently faced a delay of that magnitude – banished by March 2025, and that the waiting list starts shrinking by March 2024, two months before the next election. Javid gamely talked up the plan as embodying “a new national mission” to bust the backlog and offering “a bold and radical vision” for improving healthcare. He promised that hundreds of new “community diagnostic hubs” and “surgical hubs” would ensure speedier access to tests and treatment. All that may or may not prove to be the case over the next few years. Patients need it to happen. But in the short- and medium-term the backlog is fraught with political danger, not just for Javid, but also for Boris Johnson, whose election win in 2019 was in part due to his eye-catching and oft-repeated NHS pledges. Commitments to hire 50,000 more nurses, build 40 new hospitals and recruit 6,000 extra GPs, which helped to neutralise the NHS as a negative for the Conservatives, played their part in the landslide. A key determinant in the success of the plan is the known unknown of how many of the estimated 10 million people who avoided seeking NHS help during the Covid pandemic will belatedly do so. It could be 30% or it could be 80%, Javid told MPs. “Even if half these people come forward, this is going to place huge demand on the NHS” – that is, huge extra demand on a service that by its own performance metrics is increasingly unable to cope with the unceasing need for care it is already facing. That is why he made clear that delivering the plan’s key dates was an “ambition”, not a pledge. That realism was an implicit admission that he is not in control of events; that he cannot guarantee any fall in the headline number of people forced to wait by any set date. There are serious doubts that the ambitions will be fulfilled. Privately, NHS bosses, health experts and doctors concur with what Max Warner of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said on Friday: that “there is almost no chance that the NHS will clear the Covid backlog and get the number of people on the waiting list back to pre-pandemic levels before the end of this parliament”. The NHS’s lack of staff, beds and equipment relative to EU and OECD countries, noted in a recent National Audit Office report on waiting times, will inhibit the plan’s ambitions being fulfilled. The backlog “is one of the big challenges for the government. The scale of it is enormous,” said a source in Javid’s department. Ensuring that the waiting list is reducing by spring 2024 will be “really tough”. Projections prepared for ministers show that the backlog could reach 9.2 million by March 2024 under a best-case scenario and 10.7 million in the worst case. A tenth of England’s population is already on the list. Under the latter projection that would rise to one-sixth. That could mean that every sixth voter Tory campaigners canvass in 2024 will be waiting for a procedure of some sort in hospital. While some may be sanguine about waiting, others will be frustrated, or even angry. Who will they blame: Covid, the government or the NHS itself? One Tory MP, an ex-health minister, observes that: “MPs are getting very little flak from constituents about long waits for surgery. People in general, for now at least, have accepted that Covid has been disruptive to aspects of NHS care.” That suggests Javid’s self-serving attempt to portray the waiting list as “the Covid-19 backlog” may be working. However, the MP adds ominously: “But if long delays are not addressed before the next election I suspect this will pose political risk for Boris Johnson and become a major issue for many MPs in marginal seats who wish to be re-elected.” Delays will most affect, and most worry, a key Tory demographic – older people. As the Tory MP Edward Leigh said: “People of a certain age, of which unfortunately I am one, are terrified because they think that if something goes wrong, they may have to wait in pain for two years and we can’t wait until March 24 to join the back of a slightly shorter queue.” The backlog could intensify tensions within the government, especially over the national insurance hike, and also between ministers and an NHS receiving record funding that they believe is guilty of backsliding on its part of the deal. But the greatest risk it poses for Johnson is the gift it hands to opposition parties. As the waiting list continues ever upward, a potentially growing mismatch between the public’s need for prompt care and the NHS’s ability to provide it could prove politically toxic. And the reality of NHS waits is not just undone surgery. It’s also delays in accessing all key types of NHS care – to see a GP, get A&E care, for an ambulance or to receive mental health help. When Labour left office in May 2010, the waiting list stood at 2.6 million. It then rose slowly until 2015 and has been rising relentlessly ever since. Given it was at 4.4 million when Covid struck in March 2020, the pandemic is responsible for only 1.7 million – or 28% – of the 6.1 million total. Wes Streeting, Javid’s agile Labour shadow, stresses that “this isn’t a Covid backlog; it’s a Tory backlog”. It is a charge that he and Keir Starmer will doubtless hammer home regularly and one which, if supported by patients enduring the pain and fear of long waits, could help decide who wins in 2024.",News/Society,NHS backlog poses existential risk to Boris Johnson’s government,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/13/nhs-backlog-poses-existential-risk-boris-johnson-government
