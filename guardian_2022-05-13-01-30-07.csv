5/13/2022,"Erik ten Hag will push to make Barcelona’s Frenkie de Jong one of his first signings at Manchester United. The pair worked together for a year and a half at Ajax, the club Ten Hag is leaving for Old Trafford this month. Contact has been made between the parties but no agreement is close. Barcelona’s financial troubles could make them willing to entertain offers of at least €70m (£60m), although Ten Hag would have to persuade De Jong of the merits of joining United given that the midfielder regards competing in the Champions League as a priority. De Jong told the Guardian in February that he hoped to stay at Barcelona “for many more years”, describing it as a dream to have signed, even though he admitted he would have liked to have won more trophies. The manager, Xavi Hernández, would like the 25-year-old to continue at the club. Barcelona are poised to raise funds through the sale of Philippe Coutinho, having agreed a €20m deal with Aston Villa for the Brazilian, who has been on loan at the Premier League club since January. De Jong, a Netherlands international, has started 29 of the 32 La Liga games for which he has been available this season. He has scored three goals and provided three assists in those matches. United have reached an agreement for Mitchell van der Gaag, Ten Hag’s assistant at Ajax, to join the club and there remains the possibility that Steve McClaren could be added to the coaching staff. Ajax have confirmed that Alfred Schreuder will join from Club Brugge to replace Ten Hag as manager on a two-year contract.",Sport/Football,Erik ten Hag makes Barcelona’s Frenkie de Jong a Manchester United target,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/12/erik-ten-hag-wants-manchester-united-sign-frenkie-de-jong-barcelona
5/13/2022,"The government has declined a Commons instruction to release information about the decision to make Evgeny Lebedev a peer, saying this would undermine the confidentiality of those nominated and could degenerate into “political point-scoring”. Labour called the decision “a cover-up”, and promised more action over what it called a contempt of parliament. In March, a so-called humble address motion tabled by Labour was passed by the Commons amid a threatened Tory rebellion, directing ministers to release information about the elevation of the Russian-born businessman and son of a former KGB officer. The vote, in which Tory MPs were instructed to abstain given the extent of backbench Conservative disquiet on the issue, followed revelations that the intelligence services had concerns about a peerage for Lebedev awarded by Boris Johnson, a close friend. But a Cabinet Office document released on Thursday, running to nine pages, contained no new information beyond a handful of redacted emails, including one in which Lebedev confirmed he had completed a form, and another in which an unidentified official congratulated him on the peerage. The only other information was already known official information, such as a full list of people made political peers in 2020 alongside Lebedev. In a parallel written statement of explanation, the Cabinet Office minister Michael Ellis said that while the government “is and remains committed to openness and transparency”, it would not abide by the Commons request. Ministers had provided a more detailed response to parliament’s intelligence and security committee “following a separate request from them for information relating to any national security matters arising”, he said. Such updates to the committee are kept confidential. On a more general release of information, ministers had to balance openness with “the wider public interest”, and it would not be helpful to publish details about the scrutiny given to prospective peers, Ellis argued. “I can assure parliament that proper consideration would be given to any information which indicated national security concern arising from a prospective appointment before a decision was made,” he wrote. “It is essential that the confidentiality of these arrangements is maintained as it is this that ensures the vetting procedures are suitably robust and command confidence, whilst also protecting the private and personal data of those individuals who have entered into the vetting process.” In what was almost a veiled warning about the consequences of agreeing to the request, Ellis wrote: “Honourable members should be conscious that requests for information on the internal correspondence of the [House of Lords Appointments] Commission could also be applied to such opposition recommendations (including those which are rejected or withdrawn). “I do not believe it would be in the public interest for such internal correspondence to be used in the future for political point-scoring.” He ended: “Lord Lebedev is a man of good standing.” Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: “This looks like a cover-up and smells like a cover-up because it is a cover-up. If the prime minister is claiming he was not involved in forcing through the award of a peerage to an individual of concern to our intelligence services, he should come clean and publish the documents as parliament instructed. “The government is once again seeking to hide in the shadows from the sunlight of scrutiny. We will take steps to rectify this contempt of parliament.” Boris Johnson’s deputy spokesperson defended the process: “It’s our responsibility to protect the integrity of the vetting process which, as you know, is voluntarily entered into on a confidential basis. We are committed to transparency, but the disclosure we have made reflects the need to maintain the integrity of the system.”",News/Media,Government refuses to release Lebedev peerage details despite MPs’ instruction,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/12/government-refuses-to-release-lebedev-peerage-details-despite-mps-instruction
5/13/2022,"At the end of this season Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla is stepping down as music director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. Although her appearances this week were by no means a farewell – she and the orchestra are about to tour central Europe together, and next season she will spend four weeks with them as chief guest conductor – they were her last in Symphony Hall in the position she has held since 2016. Though that association has produced many fine things, it has perhaps not been quite the success that was expected when Gražinytė-Tyla was appointed, and there’s a sense that the Birmingham audience has not had the chance to appreciate the full extent of her capabilities. One of many composers that she has explored little with the CBSO is Bruckner, and to judge from her performance of the Sixth Symphony in this concert, that is a real disappointment. If the Sixth – compact, lively, direct – is the work that might persuade even Bruckner agnostics of the virtues of his music, then this performance should certainly have been the one to hear. There was nothing remotely portentous or overbearing about Gražinytė-Tyla’s approach: played with great assurance and richness of tone by the CBSO, everything moved with an ease and lightness, downplaying the fierceness of the confrontations of the first movement, making the great funeral-march Adagio less solemn, more consoling than usual, and even giving the finale a coherence it can sometimes lack. This programme was one that had been scheduled for March 2020, and, as then, the Bruckner was preceded by Tchaikovsky’s First Piano Concerto with Gabriela Montero as the soloist. If her approach to such a familiar work could never be described as subtly nuanced, it was undoubtedly dynamic and arresting, and after it Montero offered an improvisation on a theme from Ennio Morricone’s Cinema Paradiso score, as suggested by a member of the audience. The result was rather like a Busoni transcription of Bach, but just right as an encore.",Arts/Music,CBSO/Gražinytė-Tyla review – assured Bruckner and arresting Tchaikovsky mark the end of a Birmingham era,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/12/cbso-grazinyte-tyla-review-assured-bruckner-and-arresting-tchaikovsky-mark-the-end-of-a-birmingham-era
5/13/2022,"Shireen Abu Aqleh, the Palestinian American journalist shot dead during an Israeli army operation, has been honoured with a full state memorial in the West Bank city of Ramallah. At least 5,000 people lined the streets on Thursday as her coffin, draped in the Palestinian flag, was driven through the city and the Qalandia checkpoint en route to St Joseph hospital nearer her home in occupied East Jerusalem. Her funeral will be held in the holy city on Friday. Attenders brought wreaths of flowers and waved Palestinian flags as the ambulance carrying her body passed by, escorted by a dozen masked gunmen belonging to the Palestinian Fatah movement. Some people threw rose petals while the militants fired into the air, accompanied by chants of “From Ramallah to Jenin, God have mercy on you, Shireen” and “The true voice never dies”. The 51-year-old reporter was shot in the head on Wednesday morning in the West Bank city of Jenin during what her colleagues at the scene said was a surprise burst of Israeli fire on a small group of journalists covering an expected Israeli military raid. Video of the incident shows Abu Aqleh was wearing a helmet and body armour clearly marked “press”. Ali Samodi, a producer for Al Jazeera who was shot in the back, told the Guardian from his hospital bed that contrary to claims made by Israeli officials, there were no gunmen standing near the journalists when they were targeted. “There were no fighters around, no civilians, nothing. Just the Israeli soldiers and the press. There were many bullets. After I was hit and Shireen was killed, they just kept shooting,” he said. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) initially said its troops shot back after coming under “massive fire” from militants in Jenin, a historical flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict where the IDF has been conducting near-daily raids in the wake of a recent wave of terrorist attacks against Israelis, which have left 19 dead. Many of the perpetrators came from the Jenin area. Israeli officials, including the prime minister, Naftali Bennett, initially insisted there was “a considerable chance that armed Palestinians, who fired wildly, were the ones who brought about the journalist’s unfortunate death.” But later on Wednesday the Israeli military chief Lt Gen Aviv Kochavi and the defence minister, Benny Gantz, appeared to back away from those assertions. Gantz conceded it could have been “the Palestinians who shot her” or fire from “our side”, adding: “We are not sure how she was killed. We are investigating.” The IDF circulated what it said was a video of militants in Jenin engaged in a gunfight on the morning Abu Aqleh was shot in which they claimed to have hit a soldier. The footage was challenged by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, which visited the two locations and found from the GPS coordinates that it was impossible for the shooting depicted in the IDF-distributed video to be the same gunfire that hit Abu Aqleh and Samodi. Israel has denied allegations from the Qatar-based Al Jazeera that the journalists were “intentionally targeted” and Abu Aqleh was “assassinated in cold blood”. The correspondent’s death has led to grief and condemnation across the Palestinian territories and the Middle East. Abu Aqleh was a familiar face to millions, reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in often dangerous circumstances for Al Jazeera’s Arabic channel since 1997. In an unusual move, and in an indication of the respect for her across Palestinian society, a memorial service for the reporter was held at the Ramallah compound of the Palestinian Authority (PA) president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Thursday morning. Foreign diplomats, journalists, religious leaders and prominent Palestinian and Arab Israeli politicians were in attendance as Abbas vowed “this crime should not go unpunished,” adding that the PA held Israel “completely responsible” for her death and had “refused and rejected” an Israeli proposal for a joint investigation into the killing. “We refused a joint investigation because [Israelis] are the criminals and we don’t trust them,” he said. “We will go to the international criminal court to uncover the truth.” The ICC launched an investigation into possible Israeli war crimes over a year ago, although Israel has rejected the probe as biased. Hussein al-Sheikh, a senior aide to Abbas, has rejected an Israeli request to conduct ballistic analysis on the bullet, saying the PA would conduct its own investigation and convey the results “with high transparency” to Abu Aqleh’s family, the US, Qatar and the public. Bennett accused the Palestinians on Thursday of denying Israel “access to the basic findings required to get to the truth”. He called on the PA not to take “any steps to disrupt the investigation or to contaminate the investigation process”. The EU has called for an independent inquiry while the US has demanded the killing be “transparently investigated” – calls echoed by the UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet. An initial autopsy and forensic examination were conducted in the West Bank city of Nablus hours after Abu Aqleh’s death, but no final conclusions have been disclosed. The journalist’s funeral will take place on Friday at a Roman Catholic church in Jerusalem before she is buried in the family plot in the city’s Mount Zion cemetery. “Shireen’s killing was a message to the Palestinian people to try and kill our spirit,” said Mufaz Jaba, 38, who attended the memorial procession in Ramallah. “Instead it’s the opposite. Her death has helped unite Palestinian society and reminded the world of how important the Palestinian cause is,” he said.",News/World news,Shireen Abu Aqleh: thousands attend state memorial in West Bank,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/shireen-abu-aqleh-thousands-attend-state-memorial-in-west-bank
5/13/2022,"Critics have accused the European Commission of seeking to end encrypted communications after the EU’s executive body unveiled strict regulations for messaging apps intended to fight the spread of child sexual abuse imagery. Under the proposed regulations, messaging services and web hosts would be required to search for, and report, child abuse material – even in the case of encrypted messaging services like Apple’s iMessage and Facebook’s WhatsApp that cannot be scanned in such a way. “Detection, reporting and removal of child sexual abuse online is urgently needed to prevent the sharing of images and videos of the sexual abuse of children, which retraumatises the victims often years after the sexual abuse has ended,” said Ylva Johansson, the EU’s commissioner for home affairs on Thursday. “Today’s proposal sets clear obligations for companies to detect and report the abuse of children, with strong safeguards guaranteeing privacy of all, including children,” she added. Andy Burrows, head of child safety online at the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), welcomed the proposals, which he described as an “impressively bold and ambitious” attempt to “systemically prevent avoidable child abuse and grooming, which is taking place at record levels”. He added: “If approved, it will place a clear requirement on platforms to combat abuse wherever it takes place, including in private messaging where children are at greatest risk.” But the plans have also been criticised as an attack on privacy. “Private companies would be tasked not just with finding and stopping distribution of known child abuse images, but could also be required to take action to prevent ‘grooming’ or suspected future child abuse,” said Joe Mullin of Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a privacy group. “This would be a massive new surveillance system, because it would require the infrastructure for detailed analysis of user messages.” The regulation does not technically require providers to turn off end-to-end encryption entirely. Instead, it allows providers to apply automated techniques to scan for abusive material on users’ devices – a compromise that supporters say preserves privacy while also helping deter child abuse. It is a similar approach to that proposed – but indefinitely postponed – by Apple, when the company suggested scanning photos before they were uploaded to its cloud storage. Apple’s approach, however, only scanned photos looking for examples of existing child abuse imagery. The commission’s proposal includes a requirement to detect newly created images, and even to look for active grooming, which is far harder to successfully achieve with existing automated systems without compromising privacy. It also suggests that app stores, like those run by Apple and Google, should be involved in enforcing the requirements, pulling apps that don’t comply with the scanning obligations. Patrick​ ​Breyer, German MEP for the​ ​Pirate​ ​party, called the proposals “fundamental​ ​rights​ ​terrorism​ ​against​ ​trust,​ ​self-determination​ ​and​ ​security​ ​on​ ​the​ iInternet”. He added: “The​ ​proposed​ ​chat​ ​control​ ​threatens​ ​to​ ​destroy​ ​digital​ ​privacy​ ​of​ ​correspondence​ ​and​ ​secure​ encryption. “​Scanning​ ​personal​ ​cloud​ ​storage​ ​would​ ​result​ ​in​ ​the​ ​mass​ ​surveillance​ ​of​ ​private​ ​photos.

5/13/2022,"Jürgen Klopp expects Fabinho to be fit for the Champions League final despite the Liverpool midfielder sustaining a hamstring injury during Tuesday’s win over Aston Villa. The 28-year-old will miss Saturday’s FA Cup final with Chelsea and the two remaining Premier League games of the season against Southampton and Wolves as a result of a strain to his left hamstring. However, he should recover to face Real Madrid in Paris on 28 May. Klopp said: “There’s a good chance that he will be available for the Champions League final.” Although Fabinho’s absence is undoubtedly a setback to Liverpool’s FA Cup and title prospects, their manager believes his squad will handle the loss. Klopp, who replaced Fabinho with Jordan Henderson to good effect against Villa, said: “We have to cope, because we can cope. Having him or not having him is a difference but it is all fine.

5/13/2022,"At least 24 undercover police officers infiltrated a small leftwing party as part of a surveillance operation criticised as being “Orwellian” and unjustified in its scale, a public inquiry has heard. Officers were sent to spy on the Socialist Workers party (SWP) in deployments that usually lasted four years. The party, whose total membership fluctuated around a few thousand, was the leftwing group most infiltrated by undercover police. The surveillance was almost continuous between 1970 and 2007, with huge files being compiled on party members. These recorded personal details such as physical appearances, holiday plans, weddings, sexuality and childcare arrangements. The secret files extended to logging the name and address of a 15-year-old boy who regularly bought the SWP’s newspaper in 1981, and pages of photocopied cheques – for as little as £2 – from trade unionists who donated to a campaign against unemployment in 1982. The undercover police compiled a 171-page report on one of the SWP’s annual conferences, recording how the party discussed its political progress. A report on a later conference ran to 140 pages. The conferences were openly organised by the party. In 1980, the police infiltrated the SWP’s annual rally, which had also been openly publicised, and subsequently listed the names and addresses of more than 1,000 supporters who had attended. The extent of the infiltration was examined on Thursday at a public inquiry into how undercover police units spied on more than 1,000 predominantly leftwing political groups in operations that ran for more than four decades from 1968. Giving evidence to the inquiry, Lindsey German, a prominent SWP member for 30 years, criticised how the police collected “trivial and pointless” information about public events. The SWP is a Trotskyite party that promotes the abolition of capitalism through revolutionary means. German said: “We were exercising our democratic rights to organise, protest, campaign and educate. This should not have been a reason to be treated as criminals.” She rejected allegations that the party caused public disorder at demonstrations. The state was not justified in devoting so many resources “towards surveillance of people with whom they do not agree – it is a kind of thought police. The scale of it is also quite Orwellian,” German said. The party operated as an open organisation that was easy to join, she said, adding that it was “perhaps too easy to join” in light of the scale of police infiltration. She said she was disgusted that the police had recorded details of her relationships and living arrangements. The current phase of the inquiry, which is headed by the retired judge Sir John Mitting, is looking at covert operations between 1968 and 1982. A demonstration by victims of the surveillance was held outside the inquiry on Thursday. The inquiry has heard how the MI5 security service told police in 1973 that spying on the SWP was one of its primary aims and asked that undercover police infiltrate its headquarters. The police were able to meet MI5’s request to have “a permanent well-placed” spy there. The detailed reports of the SWP’s annual conferences of 1978 and 1980 that were collated by the police spies encompassed its administration and finances, and lists of trade unions and educational institutions that included party members.",News/UK news,"Scale of police spying on UK leftist party was ‘Orwellian’, inquiry hears",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/12/scale-of-police-spying-on-uk-leftist-party-was-orwellian-inquiry-hears
5/13/2022,"Rebekah Vardy has admitted knowing that her agent was forwarding private information about Coleen Rooney to a journalist at the Sun. Vardy, who denies leaking stories from Rooney’s private Instagram account to the same newspaper and has brought a multimillion-pound libel case in an attempt to clear her name, made the admission under cross-examination at the high court. Vardy told the ongoing “Wagatha Christie” libel trial that she “didn’t think [her agent] was passing on any new information” to the Sun journalist Andy Halls for a story about Rooney supposedly crashing her car. The wife of the Leicester City player Jamie Vardy insisted the Sun already knew the key details of the story in question and therefore she could not be the original source. Rooney’s barrister, David Sherborne, asked Vardy: “You didn’t object at any stage to the fact that Ms Watt was plainly passing on information from Mrs Rooney’s private Instagram account to Andy Halls?” Vardy replied: “I didn’t think she was passing on any new information.” Sherborne pressed on: “Take the word ‘new’ out of it. Did you, or did you not, know that Ms Watt was passing on information from Mrs Rooney’s private account?” Vardy replied: “She was talking to Mr Halls about information that was already being discussed.” In one WhatsApp exchange heard by the court, Watt told Vardy that the Sun journalist was trying to confirm details for a story he was writing about Rooney. The agent asked Vardy whether Rooney had definitely crashed her car, a detail that allegedly came from the private Instagram account. She replied with the words: “Haha she deffo did.” Rooney later posted a public tweet saying it was “sad” that someone who followed her was “betraying” her to the Sun. Watt forwarded this tweet to Vardy, commenting: “It wasn’t someone she trusted. It was me.” Rooney’s lawyer suggested this was an admission of guilt. Vardy told the court she didn’t reply because she was “watching Gemma Collins faceplanting on ice” on the ITV show Dancing on Ice. Vardy was giving her final day of evidence in the week-long trial against Rooney, which has shone a light on the workings of celebrity tabloid culture. The court heard that Rooney had become exasperated with information on her private Instagram account being leaked to the Sun. At one point she asked the “grass” to stop passing stories to the tabloid, which she described as a “scum of a newspaper”. Rooney’s lawyers allege that Vardy was involved in leaking stories from the private Instagram account to the newspaper. They accused Vardy of lying during cross-examination and repeatedly changing her witness testimony during the lengthy legal proceedings. Sherborne said he had wanted to search WhatsApp messages held on Watt’s phone but it had been dropped over the side of a boat and was now “lying at the bottom of sea in Davy Jones’s locker”. Vardy asked the court: “Who is Davy Jones?” The judge intervened to explain the reference. On Thursday morning Vardy also admitted collaborating with paparazzi agencies to stage supposedly authentic photos to sell to tabloid newspapers. However, she denied she had helped arrange a paparazzi photographer to ambush her and other footballer’s wives at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. “If I had intentionally arranged the picture … I would quite happily admit that I had,” she told the court. The court heard a message exchange between Vardy and her agent in which the agent said she had “got a photographer sorted for tomorrow” and Vardy replied “OK”. Vardy said she was “just trying to get [Watt] off my back and enjoy my evening – it had been quite a crazy few days.” Sherborne suggested that Vardy attempted to stop some of the fellow footballers’ wives from posting a group picture on social media in order to protect the photographer’s exclusive. Vardy said she did not recall some of the details of the night. “If I’m completely honest I had been drinking quite a bit.” Coleen Rooney watched on intently and took extensive notes on Vardy’s evidence. The former England footballer Wayne Rooney sat beside his wife with his hands clasped, staring into space. Both are expected to give evidence in the coming days. When Vardy began one answer by saying “if I’m honest …”, the barrister snapped back: “I would hope you’re honest because you’re sitting in a witness box.” Sherborne also accused Vardy of having “selective amnesia”, to which she responded: “No.” At one point Rooney’s barrister described a WhatsApp message in a conversation between Vardy and Watt that included the words “poor Coleen” followed by “laughing emojis”. Vardy told the court she disputed this characterisation: “I don’t know whether they’re laughing emojis.” The lawyer, in an apparent reference to the 😂 emoji, replied: “OK, crying with laughter.”",News/UK news,Vardy admits knowing agent sent private details about Rooney to the Sun,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/12/rebeckah-vardy-admits-knowing-agent-sent-private-details-about-coleen-rooney-to-the-sun
5/13/2022,"The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has chosen an outspoken critic of Brexit as the next member of the Bank of England’s interest rate-setting committee. Dr Swati Dhingra, an associate professor at the London School of Economics who has previously called on the government to “cancel Brexit”, will join the monetary policy committee (MPC) in August, arriving during one of the most difficult periods faced by the central bank. An Indian-born academic who gained a PhD in the US before moving to the UK, Dhingra will join just as inflation is expected to be heading above 10% and the economy could be sliding into recession. The first Asian woman to be appointed to the role, her arrival means one-third of the nine-strong policymaking group are women, for the first time since 2005. That number has never been surpassed, leaving the Bank some way short of gender parity. Dhingra and her colleagues at LSE have tracked the relationship between the UK and its continental neighbours since the 2016 Brexit vote and in successive reports found the economic damage to be considerable. Before the parliamentary vote in December 2019 to leave the EU single market and customs union, Dhingra wrote with a colleague in LSE’s Brexit Economics series: “From an economic perspective, the best policy would be to cancel Brexit.” With Tory MPs and cabinet members bristling at claims that much of the UK’s inflation increase can be blamed on Brexit’s negative impact on trade and immigration, her appointment is likely to prove controversial. Her broader research into the UK’s trade links with China and the far east and US means she will bring a wealth of expertise about Britain’s challenges as it searches for new export markets. The search for expertise in specialist areas to fill the four external places on the MPC – the other five are taken by central bank staff – is a continuing trend. In 2018 the Treasury appointed Jonathan Haskel, an economist at Imperial College, to bolster the committee’s understanding of worker productivity. Dhingra will replace the former City economist Michael Saunders when his term finishes. Saunders, known for voting to increase interest rates when his colleagues have preferred to keep them low, was outvoted in this month’s MPC meeting when he was among three members to say there should be a 0.5% increase and not the 0.25% rise that the majority agreed. Dhingra is expected to be more cautious amid a cost of living crisis that could be made worse by increasing the cost of borrowing. She will serve a three-year term, which can be extended to a maximum of six years by the chancellor. She said: “The work of the committee is of great importance as the UK faces an exceptional cost of living crisis amid the global challenges of the pandemic and the war.” Dhingra studied for her undergraduate degree at the University of Delhi. She received a doctorate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US and was a fellow at Princeton. “Dr Swati Dhingra’s experience in international economics will bring valuable new expertise to the MPC,” Sunak said. The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, said: “I am very pleased to be welcoming Dr Swati Dhingra to the MPC later this year. Her insights and perspective will be hugely beneficial to all of our discussions and we will benefit from her extensive research in international economics.",News/Business,Swati Dhingra to join Bank of England’s monetary policy committee,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/12/swati-dhingra-to-join-bank-of-england-monetary-policy-committee

We see workers and those in receipt of social protection payments becoming insolvent because their income won’t pay for basic necessities. Meanwhile, rising prices are being driven, to a large extent and pervasively, by increases in the cost of fossil fuels and everything that derives from them. The fossil fuel industry is the very thing that rational governments would be trying urgently to taper, in the light of unequivocal evidence of climate and environmental breakdown. So people choose between eating and heating, while fossil fuel company directors and shareholders reap the rewards of an industry that, in the UN secretary general’s words, is “killing us”.

5/13/2022,"KPMG will pay one of the largest fines in UK audit history, after former staff forged documents and misled the regulator over audits for companies including the collapsed outsourcer Carillion. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) – which regulates accountants – confirmed the £14.4m settlement at a London tribunal hearing on Thursday, and said KPMG would also face a “severe reprimand” over the “extremely serious” misconduct related to employees’ false representations to the watchdog. The fine relates to misleading information provided to the FRC as part of audit quality reviews (AQR), meant to confirm the integrity of audits conducted for both Carillion and the software firm Regenesis between 2014 and 2016. The tribunal upheld allegations by the FRC that KPMG and former staff created false meeting minutesand retroactively edited spreadsheets, before sharing those documents with the FRC. Mark Ellison QC, who was representing the FRC on the first day of the two-day tribunal hearing, said KPMG’s total fine for would have been worth £20m – the largest fine on record, ahead of the £15m fine issued to Deloitte in 2020 over its historic audits of the software company Autonomy – but the figure was reduced to £14.4m to reflect the accounting firm’s cooperation and willingness to admit guilt. “The misconduct found in this case is extremely serious,” Ellison told the tribunal. “It cuts at the very heart of the protection of the public interest in the respondents’ regulator, the FRC. It was misconduct deliberately aimed at deceiving AQR inspectors appointed by the FRC.” The settlement is the latest in a long-running saga related to the FRC’s investigation into the events surrounding Carillion’s failure in January 2018, which subsequently sparked wide-ranging criticism over the quality of audits across the UK. The outsourcer collapsed with £7bn of debts in January 2018, resulting in 3,000 job losses and causing chaos across hundreds of its projects – including two big hospitals, schools, roads and even Liverpool FC’s stadium, Anfield. The tribunal, which began in January, will consider over the coming weeks the penalties for individual KPMG staff, including one of its partners, Peter Meehan. The FRC recommended on Thursday that the 60-year-old be banned from the accounting and auditing sector for 15 years and face a fine of at least £400,000. The regulator also believes that three other KPMG staff – Alistair Wright, Richard Kitchen, and Adam Bennett – should each be excluded from the sector for 12 years and face a £100,000 fine. Pratik Paw, who was a more junior member of the team at the time of the misconduct, could face a four-year exclusion and a £50,000 fine. Stuart Smith, who was the partner in charge of the Regenersis audit, reached a confidential settlement with the FRC in January. Commenting on the settlement with the FRC, KPMG’s chief executive, Jon Holt, said KPMG was “deeply sorry that such serious misconduct occurred in our firm. It was unjustifiable and wrong. It was a violation of our processes and a betrayal of our values. “I am saddened that a small number of former employees acted in such an inappropriate way, and it is right that they – and KPMG – now face serious regulatory sanctions as a result.” He noted that KPMG self-reported the misconduct to the regulator and had cooperated fully with the tribunal and the FRC throughout its investigation. “As a firm, we are committed to serving the public interest with honesty and integrity. We have worked hard, and with complete transparency to our regulator, to assure ourselves that this matter does not represent the wider culture or practice of our firm.” The FRC is separately investigating KPMG and former Carillion directors over the audit, and preparation of Carillion’s 2016 accounts.",News/Business,KPMG to be fined £14m for forging documents over Carillion audit,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/12/kpmg-fined-frc-audit-carillion
5/13/2022,"Once upon a time, we could call Spurs v Arsenal “Spurs v Arsenal” or, at a push, the “north London derby”. Well, not any more. Now, it’s the “NLD, shown live on your TV, in super UHD, costing bare GBP” … at which point the Tinie Tempah tribute has to stop, because we’ve not yet invented a catchy acronym for “battle for fourth place that’s like winning a trophy”. Soon, friends, soon. But in the meantime, here we are. This game was, of course, originally scheduled for January, but then one of Arsenal’s ballboy’s hamsters got Covid and Omar Rekik went to Afcon, meaning Mikel Arteta’s brave young heroes weren’t allowed out to play. So Sky cogitated and deliberated for four long months, eventually alighting on tonight as the only conceivable day between then and now capable of staging so momentous a contest. In so doing, they may also have manipulated the fixture list at a crucial stage of the season for their own avaricious ends, but that’s a total coincidence and, on the plus side, at least they haven’t compromised the integrity of the competition, having helped divest it of that many years ago. Swings and roundabouts, as they say. The thing is, if we exclude those petty concerns, they were absolutely right to do what they’ve done, because the NLD has, over the years, established itself as the Premier League’s most reliably exciting fixture, full of goals, excitement, and all the things that “NO ONE” – apart from EVERYONE – “wants to see”. Or, in other words, football’s biggest problem is that it’s too expletive good. However, much as we’re all looking forward to enjoying the thrills, spills and aggravation, as connoisseurs of the beautiful game, we’re just as excited by the managerial battle of wits. Will Antonio Conte’s ersatz, remorseless, counterattacking style have the measure of Arteta’s sharper and more natural inclination? Or will the Arsenal man’s grooved uniformity hold sway over the Italian’s wild and emotional fluctuations? But enough about their hair. In just a few hours’ time, a football match will take place and both men are desperate for glory, their toil and sacrifice taking these grand old teams right back to where they belong: sometimes competing for fourth.

5/13/2022,"John Young, who has died unexpectedly aged 62, had his first puzzle published in the Guardian in 1984. He set as Shed for this paper and as Dogberry in the Financial Times. His clues were always conspicuously fair and unpedantic and he was the kindest, most natural and easygoing person an editor could wish to work with. John was introduced to cryptic puzzles by his parents, Audrey (nee Jones), a secretary, and Bill Young, a research forester. His mother set puzzles for the Guardian as Audreus until well into her 90s. After a degree in French and German at Durham University and a spell as a travel representative in various countries, he got a doctorate at Sheffield University, where he then worked on a project to produce an electronic version of Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, written by the Protestant English historian and first published in 1563. This led to a contract at Imperial College London as assistant editor on another project to publish all of Isaac Newton’s alchemical, theological and administrative papers. Throughout this period, John was setting a regular stream of elegant cryptic puzzles. In addition, he joined forces with three other Guardian setters – Araucaria (John Graham), Paul (John Halpern) and Enigmatist (John Henderson) – to set the occasional puzzles jointly as “we johns” under the name of WE Johns’ WWI character Biggles. After each such puzzle appeared, they and I, the crossword editor, all met for a celebratory lunch, appropriately held in a pub at Biggleswade in Bedfordshire. John hated living in London and so took himself back to Sheffield and later to Ely. After the death of his mother three years ago he seemed to lose much of his desire to set puzzles. He produced his last one for the Guardian in 2020.",Lifestyle/Crosswords,John Young obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2022/may/12/john-young-obituary
