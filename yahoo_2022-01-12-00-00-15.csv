1/12/2022,"New, grisly details emerged regarding the stabbing death of Sergio Bonboster, whose mutilated body was found in an empty northwest Fresno canal in October. Bonboster, 20, was reported missing by his family on Oct. 7. Five days later, his body was found in a dry canal near Hughes and Emerson avenues, covered in a tarp. Detectives arrested Bonboster’s roommate Lawrence Madrid, 20, and Madrid’s 17-year-old girlfriend. Police believe the teenager intervened during a fight between the men and stabbed Bonboster multiple times. Smith said Bonboster was stabbed in the neck, back and chest a total of 19 times. The teenager is charged with murder. Madrid is charged with being an accessory to murder and mutilation of human remains. During his arraignment Monday, prosecutor Elana Smith alleged Madrid tried to cover up the murder and dispose of the body by cutting it in half and stashing it in different places. “One place was under a nearby bridge and he hid another part in a dumpster at the apartment,” Smith told Judge Leanne Le Mon. Smith pushed for Madrid, who was released from the Fresno County Jail because of COVID-19 precautions, to be placed back in custody. “Based on the seriousness of this offense we have concerns about his custody status,” Smith said. “And concerns about public safety.” Le Mon agreed and ordered Madrid, who pleaded not guilty to the charges, to be placed back in jail with bail set at $50,000. Family members of Bonboster who were present in the courtroom nodded with approval. His sister, Jazmine Bonboster, said she was “completely shocked and heartbroken” at the loss of her brother. “He liked living his life like any other 20-year-old,” she said. “Family and friends were big to him and he loved being an uncle.” The teenage murder suspect is being housed at the Juvenile Justice Center. Smith said the district attorney’s office has filed a motion to have the teenager tried as an adult.

1/12/2022,"The U.S. set a new COVID-19 hospitalization record Monday, exceeding 140,000 patients for the first time since the start of the pandemic — a warning sign, experts say, that the nation’s Omicron surge is already more severe than in other countries and will only get worse as it spreads from highly vaccinated cities to less protected parts of the U.S. America’s previous.hospitalization peak came on Jan. 6, 2021, when 139,781 COVID patients were hospitalized nationwide, according to New York Times data. But that was several months before a mass vaccination effort kicked in and shielded recipients from the vast majority of severe disease. On Monday, the number of Americans hospitalized with COVID-19 hit 142,388. Word of a new U.S. hospitalization record may surprise Americans who have repeatedly heard that the hypermutated Omicron variant — which has triggered an unprecedented wave of breakthrough cases in vaccinated and previously infected individuals — is ultimately milder because it’s less likely to seriously sicken those who catch it. “I think people have fixated on this idea that it’s mild,” New York University epidemiologist Céline Gounder recently told New York magazine. “Mild means mild — relatively mild — for the individual who’s infected. But it does not necessarily mean mild at a population level.” The new U.S. hospitalization numbers — including rising ICU admissions in the cities Omicron has struck first — suggest just that: If even a milder variant infects enough people, the resulting surge can be anything but “mild.” The problem, as Gounder and others have pointed out, is twofold. First, there is a ton of virus circulating right now, with an average number of new daily cases (the current 7-day average stands at 677,243) that’s nearly three times higher than ever before. Virologist Trevor Bedford of the Fred Hutchinson institute in Seattle has calculated that tests are now catching just one in four or five U.S. infections — which means that Omicron is actually infecting more than 3 million Americans each day. Second, this once unthinkable level of spread guarantees that Omicron is finding as many people at increased risk of hospitalization as possible: the entirely unvaccinated (83 million Americans); the vaccinated but unboosted (132 million Americans); and especially seniors who are not boosted (26 million) or even fully vaccinated (7 million) and who remain most susceptible to severe disease. Then, just like earlier versions of the virus, Omicron is sending far too many of them — nearly all of whom are unvaccinated or undervaccinated — to the hospital. “If a lot of people get infected, even if it’s a relatively benign virus, enough of those people will still [get] hospitalized and die that this is really going to be very overwhelming for the health care system,” Grounder explained. Not all of the news about U.S. hospitalizations is grim. Doctors are reporting fewer patients on ventilators and shorter hospital stays in comparison to past waves, data that is consistent with higher population immunity and a variant that doesn’t latch onto lung cells as well as its predecessors. And data from various states show a significant fraction of COVID-19 patients tested positive “incidentally” upon admission for some other ailment, meaning that Omicron isn’t the thing that’s making them sick enough to seek care. Unfortunately, as New York City emergency room doctor Craig Spencer explained Monday on Twitter, “entering the hospital WITH Covid versus FOR Covid isn’t a relevant distinction if the hospital doesn’t have the beds or providers needed to care for its patients. And the distinction isn’t always clear even to providers. Nor does it matter practically.” “Every Covid + patient requires the same isolation to protect other patients from getting infected,” Spencer continued. “They require the same use of PPE. And they all represent another infection risk to providers. Most importantly they all require the same space in a bed. And that’s in short supply.” In a New York Times op-ed published Monday titled, “As an E.R. Doctor, I Fear Health Care Collapse More Than Omicron,” Spencer elaborated on why U.S. hospitals trying to treat more than 140,000 COVID-19 patients at once represents an “unfolding tragedy.” Among the reasons he mentioned: “‘classic’ COVID-19 patients, short of breath and needing oxygen,” all of whom are unvaccinated; “elderly patients for whom Covid rendered them too weak to get out of bed”; “people with diabetes in whom the virus caused serious and potentially fatal complications”; and on top of that “many hospitals [now] seeing their highest levels of employee infections of the pandemic,” with some having “lost 15 percent of their workforce or more.” “The Omicron surge is real — and even if Omicron is ‘milder,’ it's not mild,” Spencer concluded on Twitter. “It causes severe disease half as often as Delta, but infects 2-4x as many people, potentially washing out any potential 'benefit.’” The data from early U.S. Omicron hot spots is starting to bear this out. In Chicago, hospitalizations have surpassed 150 percent of last winter’s peak; today, there are already more Chicagoans in the ICU or on ventilators than there were one year ago. Hospitalizations have also topped last winter’s highs in New York City and Washington, D.C. — and ICU and ventilator numbers are following the same, nearly vertical trajectory. Initially, experts were encouraged by reports out of London showing that “despite steep rises in cases and patients, the number on ventilators has barely risen,” as Financial Times data journalist John Burn-Murdoch tweeted last Tuesday. Meanwhile, Burn-Murdoch continued, “the number of people in London ICUs has fallen in recent weeks, and is not following the same path as last winter.” The hope was that the pattern would repeat itself in the U.S. because of Omicron’s relative mildness. But it hasn’t. Before Omicron arrived, the number of U.S. COVID patients in the ICU (per capita) was about twice as high as the number of U.K. COVID patients in the ICU. Today, two months later, that disparity is more than five times as high. While the U.K.’s ICU curve has remained flat, the U.S. curve has gone up about 100 percent — to the point where it’s just 21 percent lower than last winter’s pre-vaccination peak. Why? Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has theorized that “lower U.S. vax/booster rates” may be to blame. “U.S. decoupling between cases, hospitalizations, deaths, while measurable vs prior waves, isn't as strong as UK; perhaps due to lower U.S. vax/booster rates (50% eligible adults boosted),” Gottlieb tweeted Sunday. “Our protracted wrangling over boosters may have sowed confusion, sapping consumer interest.” Indeed, while America’s two-dose vaccination rate (62 percent of the total population) is somewhat lower than the U.K.’s (69 percent), its boosted rate is less than half as high: 23 percent here vs. 52 percent there. U.K. data shows that three vaccine doses prevent 88 percent of Omicron hospitalizations while two vaccine doses prevent just 52 percent. What this means for U.S. Omicron deaths remains to be seen. A New York Times analysis published Monday shows the trajectory of COVID deaths rising steeply in New York City, Boston and Washington, D.C. — and tracking closely with the trajectory of cases from three weeks earlier. (It typically takes a terminal COVID patient about that long to succumb to the disease.) And while those cities have been suffering fewer deaths per case so far this winter than last, they’re also reporting far more cases now than there were then — more than six times as many per day in New York City, for instance. Once the worst of those cases work their way through the overloaded hospital system, the absolute number of deaths may also wind up being higher this winter. On the other hand, the deadlier Delta variant was already spurring its own wave in the Northeast when Omicron took hold. So, lingering Delta cases may be making Omicron look worse than it is. Either way, the next few weeks will see Omicron spreading from cities like New York, where 74 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, to places like Mississippi, where just 49 percent of the population is fully vaccinated — and where COVID cases have increased by 702 percent over the last two weeks, more than any other state. In fact, every state where Omicron is now spreading the fastest is a low-vax state like Mississippi: Texas (+678 percent), South Carolina (+652 percent), Kentucky (+578 percent), Louisiana (+546 percent), Arkansas (+526 percent) and Alabama (+522 percent). “As Omicron advances into less vaccinated rural regions with more limited health systems capacity, it will overwhelm already strained hospitals, exacerbate sharp rural disparities in COVID deaths, and further constrain access to non-COVID care,” Anne Sosin, a public health researcher at Dartmouth College, predicted Monday. Meanwhile, 20 percent of hospitals in a state like Maryland are reporting staff shortages — and the COVID-19 Hospital Capacity Circuit Breaker dashboard shows that every single county there appears to have reached or exceeded its hospital capacity. “I can attest the situation in Maryland is [expletive] horrendous,” one physician wrote to the dashboard’s creator. “The state has been maxed out for about 2 weeks. Multiple hospitals are operating under crisis standard of care. EMS [i.e. ambulances] is now so taxed that Baltimore County started transporting people in fire trucks last week. This is absolutely unheard of and absurd. Reports of people waiting over 1-2 hours on scene with fire fighters before an EMS unit gets there. Then when they get to the hospital they wait literally hours for a bed. Transfer centers now just laugh when you call, the system is so backlogged. It’s mind-boggling to me how none of this has been national news.” _____",Health/Yahoo News,"U.S. sets new COVID hospitalization record, signaling Omicron surge could be less mild than experts hoped",https://news.yahoo.com/us-sets-new-covid-hospitalization-record-signaling-omicron-surge-could-be-less-mild-than-experts-hoped-100032439.html
1/12/2022,"Drivers throughout Florida may have noticed some streetlights giving off the wrong kind of glow. A “large number” of LED streetlights are shining a mysterious purple color, instead of the normal bright white light. Those lights aren’t a trendy new approach to lighting the roadway — they’re defective, according to the Florida Department of Transportation. LED lights are known to be brighter and more efficient than fluorescent bulbs, but they use a special filter to produce white light. The state’s transportation agency said a design flaw in a certain model of the streetlights is turning them blue and purple throughout Florida. “The manufacturer sold a large number of these fixtures to agencies all over the state of Florida and are working to provide no-cost replacements for those which are malfunctioning,” Adam Rose, an FDOT spokesperson, wrote in an email to the Bradenton Herald. Some of these purple streetlights have been spotted along Cortez Road in Bradenton, U.S. 41 in Palmetto and the Sunshine Skyway Bridge Rest Stop in Pinellas County. FDOT said defective lights have also been found in Sarasota and Lee counties. Manatee’s Public Works Department is also aware of the issue. About 25 lights in Manatee are affected by the defective filters, according to a county spokesperson. Because these streetlights don’t use traditional bulbs, the entire head needs to be replaced. While the LED light manufacturer has agreed to replace the lights for free, supply chain issues have caused delays. Manatee hopes to have their streetlights repaired in the next 2 months.

1/12/2022,"“Oh, you’ll just know. You’re a smart girl. You’ll be fine.” I remember those words from my obstetrician like it was yesterday. And, while she genuinely felt she was empowering me to be confident about my upcoming labor and delivery, she terrified me to the core. That conversation, like hundreds of others I’ve had, made me realize so many people, including doctors, really have no clue about someone like me. My obstetrician had no experience working with a paraplegic in her practice before — an all too familiar role I often played in my life of being “differently abled” and their first like me. I don’t blame her for not knowing, just as I don’t blame myself for being afraid. In my teens, I suffered a spinal cord injury that left me completely paralyzed from the chest down. I spent every moment after the accident trying to do everything that everyone else was doing. I never stopped to wonder if I could actually do those things. I just did them. That included becoming a mom. Once I became pregnant, though, I immediately began googling everything I could: “paraplegic pregnancy,” “paralyzed labor and delivery,” even “wheelchair mom.” Zero results. Obviously I knew I wasn’t the only paralyzed woman to become pregnant, but having no luck proving it left me feeling less than confident and incredibly isolated. Being pregnant was supposed to be magical, but I felt like a total sideshow out in public. I often wondered whether someone passing me just thought I had a really big cheeseburger for lunch, since the alternative was so farfetched. The notorious aches and pains and body image issues of pregnancy were resting under a dozen magnifying glasses for me. My toes and legs resembled tiny sausages, amplified by the fact that I not only couldn’t move my legs, they were also being held hostage by the swelling. My lower body was constantly suffocating from the weight of my giant belly, which was pressing down on it while always seated. Transferring myself in and out of anywhere was becoming a circus act too. Those last few weeks of getting out of bed and into my wheelchair were equal parts planning, precision and, “Welp, hope I don’t fall!” Feeling miserable, I arrived at every doctor’s appointment with questions and scenarios as to how this pregnancy might continue to progress. No one could answer anything for me, including my greatest question of them all: “Will I be able to feel contractions and actually know I’m in labor?” Now that I’ve been through two deliveries, I can tell you my answer (every paraplegic is different and will probably have a different experience): a hard NO, followed by a soft yes. For my first pregnancy, my water broke, I was dilated, and in active labor, but I had no clue whatsoever. Lucky for me, I had just shown up to a routine third-trimester appointment after finishing my morning day job. I learned I was about to give birth just as my OB finished saying, “I think it will still be another couple of weeks, but let’s take a look at your cervix ... ” I will never forget the look that she shot me as she stood up after the exam and said, “I feel hair. You need to go!” as she ever-so-nonchalantly hit the big blue button on the wall. My son was born just five hours later in the comfort of the Labor & Delivery Department of my planned hospital. No one could tell me if I was going to be able to push, but everyone had hoped. My desire to be able to do it was felt throughout the entire hospital ward, no doubt. Although the fear of it also sat sharp in my throat. There were doctors standing by with carts of various tools and trinkets ready to step in, at any given moment, to help along the process if necessary. The delivery room was a silent bustle of activity as my OB instructed me to “PUSH!” I bore down and tried to manipulate every ounce of my body to do what was necessary, although it was clear that I was commanding a body that wasn’t accustomed to responding to such demands. I had to think about my movements and my efforts so delicately, yet so precisely, the best way that I could. Not really understanding fully which muscles in my body were actually responding and reciprocating my efforts, I desperately thought of things to try to make that PUSH happen. I thought of really big jumping, like squat-jump jumping. I thought of really deep, doubled-over coughing. I even tried thinking of pooping. The thinking alone was making me woozy. But in only a handful of pushes, I was able to make progress. I was so proud of myself, dripping in sweat and awaiting the next instructed round of pushes, when my sweet baby’s heart rate began to drop. Without even time to freak out, my OB had stepped in for one final PUSH — using a vacuum instrument to ensure we all got the job done that time. Just a few shallow, exhausted breaths later, I was holding my pinkish and wailing baby boy. He was so tiny ― much tinier than I expected after causing such a ruckus. His sweet coos and effortless wriggles made me instantly forget all of the discomfort and distress I had felt over the past nine months. My next delivery was much different. With my second pregnancy, I hyper-focused on the fact that I failed to feel any sort of contractions with my first baby. From the landmark third trimester date onward, I was certain I was in labor just about every day. I thought my husband was going to disown me from the mania alone. I had convinced myself that I was going to wake up in the middle of the night to a crying baby between my legs. I went to bed wearing loose pants ― no joke, just in case! Nearly every night I would wake up distressed and feel under the sheets, just to be sure. Then there are those unmentionable things that most pregnant women experience — but again, mine were magnified by 8 billion percent. Most pregnant women can attest to the baby pressing on the bladder and the shame that can be triggered if it causes an accident. I was Niagara Falls just about every time I transferred in or out of my chair, coughed even slightly, or just repositioned my posture. I even broke down and purchased a box of pH strips to check this ever-escaping fluid, in hopes that I’d be able to tell the subtle chemical differences between urine and amniotic fluid. But that indeterminate range wasn’t really in the scope of my limited scientific knowledge nor instrumentation. I still continued to use it in hopes that it would turn into a neon sign that pointed straight up and said, “YOU ARE IN LABOR!” The kicker was that when it was all said and done, I did feel contractions this time — and totally ignored them. I was so focused on feeling them that I allowed myself to feel them and misread them. With my paralysis affecting my trunk, I am unable to feel anything from the top of my sternum down, but I can get hints of aches and pains buried deep underneath. So, when I felt a dull side ache, I just chalked it up to the position in which that sweet little fetus had found himself nestled just under my right ribcage. I griped about it to my husband but ultimately went on about my day. At one point, I even took note of the time at which I would feel that ache, but then I got distracted by other things because it didn’t hurt. I went to work and picked up my kiddo from school, but then noticed the ache was something I could even feel in my teeth. I dismissed it yet again, because I had convinced my OB of scheduling an induction on the first day of my 39th week, which was to happen the next day. I figured I could wait until tomorrow to inquire about this. Ironically enough, I didn’t need an induction at all. After I had begged and pleaded to my OB that I didn’t want to risk missing the warning signs of labor again, she finally agreed — but not any sooner than that 39th-week mark (my oldest son was born at 38 weeks). I showed up at the hospital the next morning as planned. I had taken my time and told my husband to come later because being induced can take a while. After checking in and meeting with a nurse, I began to describe that achy feeling I was having. Within minutes, she had hooked up the contraction monitor and it revealed that I was (again) in active labor without my knowledge. My sweet youngest baby boy was born just two wispy hours later. I now know that my body was trying desperately to tell me that one thing I didn’t think it could. I look at my two boys today and feel truly blessed for the luck that landed on my side for both of their births. I feel as though the universe was looking out for me both times, as I know the swiftness and surprise alone could have meant things might have worked out very differently for all of us. It could have been front-page news bad because there isn’t enough info about being pregnant or delivering if you’re a paraplegic. But it shouldn’t have to be this way. Women make up only about 20% of the entire population of people with spinal cord injuries in the U.S. Perhaps that is why there isn’t more emphasis on the obstetrics of those women. Within that population, it is estimated that about 14% become pregnant after spinal cord injury — that is roughly 8,000 women in the U.S. potentially left to deal with scenarios much like mine. All alone. That’s also roughly 8,000 babies facing a long list of unknowns. There isn’t enough support or resources for these babies nor women. We are left with only those things that we aren’t told — because no one really knows what to say in the first place. I’ve been through this — twice — yet I’ve found my concerned voice sat like that proverbial lone, felled tree in the woods. I knew I existed, but if no one could hear a sound, did I really? The whispers are there though, emphasizing the fact that it is a lonely, lonely world for a pregnant paraplegic. Those whispers come from fragments of a world that cannot possibly understand what this experience is like. So, I’m here to break the silence for women like me. I didn’t sign up for the job, but I’m going to take it on because lives are at stake. I, sadly, don’t have the solution ― I’ll have to leave that up to those with the specific education and training necessary to make progress ― but I can speak up and make some noise in hopes that it might inspire others to do what they can. As I rock my sweet babies to sleep or harness them to my lap ― or even teach them how to walk by holding onto the back of my wheel chair ― I understand that I am so, so lucky. Things could have turned out differently for me and for them. Going forward, I want to make sure every paraplegic mom-to-be has the support and knowledge and access to care that she needs and deserves to have a healthy pregnancy, delivery and birth, so luck is no longer any part of the equation.

1/12/2022,"Who cracked the case of the burned buoy? Key West police got some help tracking down two men they said vandalized the beloved landmark at the Southernmost Point of the U.S. Credit the detective work at a Duval Street bar. A bartender with a good memory and his boss with a curious mind figured out the suspects’ names after going through receipts and security camera footage. Cameron Briody, who tends bar at Irish Kevin’s on Key West’s most famous street, awoke New Year’s Day to learn that the giant buoy landmark had been scarred by a fire two people set next to it with a burning pine tree. The vandalism struck a nerve on the island. People wanted to see the suspects identified and arrested. The “coconut telegraph,” the nickname for the island’s gossip chain, was on high alert, of course. So how did a bartender turn into a detective? Briody recognized one face from a Southernost Point webcam video circulating online. He said he served the man on New Year’s Eve that police later identified as a suspect, Skylar Jacobson, 21, of Henrietta, Texas. The customer ordered drinks three times and never tipped, Briody recalled. “I knew immediately that I had served him and that he had used a card, so his name would be on the slips,” Briody said in an interview via Facebook message. So he immediately called work with the intel. Daylin Starks, the bar’s general manager, started hunting. “We have a ton of cameras here,” Starks said. “Because Cameron remembered everything, it was super easy for me.” “It took five minutes to breeze through the credit cards and find it,” Starks said. With the time stamp on the receipt, she then found camera footage that she said showed both suspects at the bar. “We could follow them the whole time, in and out of the bar,” Starks said. “We could see them getting rejected from all the girls they were trying to hit on.” The day after the vandalism, police said they knew who the two suspects were but wouldn’t release names while searching for them. By the end of the week, they announced they had arrest warrants for Jacobson and David B. Perkins, Jr., 22, of Leesburg, Florida. On Friday, Perkins was booked into the county jail on Plantation Key in the Upper Keys, and released in a couple of hours without having to post a bond, according to online records from the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office. Key West police name two suspects in Southernmost Point buoy-burning vandalism Jacobson also has plans to turn himself in, according to Key West police spokeswoman Alyson Crean. Perkins and Jacobson each face a felony charge of criminal mischief with more than $1,000 in damage. In addition to the receipts and video, Starks found the men on Facebook and Instagram. Jacobson had two Instagram accounts but one was private with the warning, “No snitches,” she said. She told police she could keep going. “I said, I can make a fake account and be friends with him,” Starks said. “They were like, ‘We’re good.’” New Year’s Eve was a huge night for Key West bars. Tourists poured in for drinks along Duval Street and packed two blocks before midnight to watch the “drops” at two bars, including the tradition of a drag queen named Sushi seated inside a giant red high-heeled shoe that descended as the last seconds of 2021 ran out. Even amid the high volume of customers, Starks said certain things can make a customer stand out. Police reported that Briody could easily remember Jacobson’s face because he was the only customer who didn’t leave a tip. Starks said Jacobson was also memorable in another way: he wore long baggy shorts with a dark T-shirt, tall black socks and a backward baseball cap. “His outfit was just so horrible it was hard not to remember him,” Starks said. The two suspects in the Southernmost Point buoy vandalism case told police they were only in Key West for one day over the holiday weekend. But they left a lasting impression — along with a mess for the city to clean up, police said. Restoring the charred buoy, which included sanding it down and repainting the entire 20-ton landmark, cost $5,379, police reported after speaking with the city’s community services director. City workers finished repairs on the buoy at the end of last week. When Perkins returned a message from Key West Police Detective Karl Malsheimer on Jan. 1, he admitted to the vandalism, saying they didn’t intend to damage the buoy but made a poor decision, according to police reports. “Perkins said everything is on camera and he made a colossal mistake,” Malsheimer wrote. The pair found the pine tree on Duval Street and dragged it to the buoy. Perkins said they didn’t initially plan to start the blaze. But once they got it to the buoy, he said it was his idea to light up the tree with a cigarette lighter, police said. In the video, the tree is lit but fizzles after the man with the lighter flips it over. He kneels and lights it again. Asked if they were drinking at the time, Perkins said “they never would have done what they did if they were in the right state of mind,” the detective wrote. “Jacobson acknowledged that what happened was a big mistake and they ‘weren’t thinking,’” the report says. Briody said he doesn’t deserve any credit for the arrests. “I simply remembered serving the one guy and things progressed from there,” he said in a Facebook message. “Daylin’s detective skills definitely solved the case and obviously the rest of the credit goes to the KWPD for all of their hard work.” But he was still given a reward: a case of rum. Paul Menta, who owns a rum distillery in downtown Key West, had promised a case to the person who could help police identify the suspects. “There’s a lesson for you: Always tip your bartender or he will remember you, for the good reasons or the bad reasons,” Briody said in a Facebook video with Menta and Key West author David Sloan. In the video, Menta hands over the case of rum, along with a “Conch Republic” flag, as the three stand at Whitehead and South streets with the Southernmost Point buoy in the background. “Thank you for helping us preserve this, keeping an eye on it,” Menta says, “and being a responsible bartender, as well.”",U.S./Miami Herald,How a Key West bartender and his boss helped solve the burning of a beloved landmark,https://news.yahoo.com/key-west-bartender-boss-helped-114125891.html
