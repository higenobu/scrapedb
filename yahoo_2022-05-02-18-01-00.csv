5/2/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- As war broke out in Europe and U.S. inflation soared, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s Warren Buffett was doubling down on a tried-and-trusted strategy to navigate the fallout. Most Read from Bloomberg Naomi Judd, of Grammy-Winning Duo The Judds, Dies at 76 Bored Ape Metaverse Frenzy Raises Millions, Crashes Ethereum Musk Engages in Twitter Spat After Rebuttal From Ocasio-Cortez Omicron Sublineages Evade Antibodies From Earlier Infections Biggest Treasury Buyer Outside U.S. Quietly Offloading Billions The billionaire investor went on his biggest stock buying spree for at least a decade, undeterred by the geopolitical turmoil and fears of runaway inflation. He and his deputies dug deeper into the U.S. stock market and expanded the conglomerate’s stakes in Chevron Corp. and Activision Blizzard Inc., even as Buffett noted the “extraordinary” price increases in Berkshire’s businesses. Buffett, who held court in Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday at Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting, had faced questions about why he didn’t take advantage of the downturn when the pandemic took hold. Now, as war and inflation fuel market volatility prompting the S&P 500 Index’s worst quarter in two years, he’s ramped up amid the uncertainty, making $41 billion in net stock purchases in the first quarter. That’s the most in data going back to 2008. “As long as Buffett and his team are paying reasonable prices for quality companies, these investments should do well in any environment -- inflationary or otherwise,” said Darren Pollock, a Berkshire investor who’s a principal at Cheviot Value Management LLC. They reflect “the sheer volume of cash coming into Berkshire’s coffers along with what we think is becoming an increasingly obvious desire to get out of cash as inflation becomes more ingrained.” Buffett said he couldn’t predict the trajectory of inflation over the coming months or years, though he said he’s seen price increases across his businesses. He also conceded -- as he’s done before -- that his firm hasn’t always been good at timing its asset purchases, though has been “reasonably good at figuring out when we were getting enough for our money.” On the home front, Berkshire let up on one of its key capital deployment levers, signaling buybacks aren’t quite as attractive to the firm right now. Still, the $3.2 billion of repurchases it did make coupled with its other investments helped shrink the conglomerate’s cash pile to roughly $106 billion -- a sum that’s still above Buffett’s preferred margin for safety. Berkshire’s stake in Chevron, which totaled nearly $4.5 billion at the end of 2021, hit $25.9 billion at the end of March, according to its first-quarter regulatory filing. The firm’s Activision stake, which accounted for just 1.87% of the video game company’s common stock, jumped to 9.5% as Berkshire wagered its deal with Microsoft Corp. would safely close. The billionaire carefully navigated some of the year’s biggest topics, if he even addressed them at all. Scarce explicit comments were made on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, though Buffett did address a question about the risk of nuclear weapons. He gave little away on Berkshire’s own succession plan. Here are some of the other key topics that came up Saturday: Succession Plans Buffett confirmed last year that Greg Abel, the vice chairman in charge of non-insurance operations, was the top candidate to succeed him when he steps down as chief executive officer. Abel, alongside fellow vice chairman Ajit Jain, joined Buffett, 91, and longtime business partner Charlie Munger, 98, on stage for a portion of the meeting. Still, Buffett gave no indication that he was planning to secede his post anytime soon, and his appearance on stage reassured some investors about his ability to keep pace with the job. “The level of mental acuity and the humor is still there. It’s really something,” said James Armstrong, whose Henry H. Armstrong Associates oversees investments in Berkshire shares. “I feel pretty satisfied that management of the company is in good shape.” Buffett joked that the top managers’ ages frankly require a chance for investors to check in on the leaders. “It’s been three years and it’s a lot better seeing actual shareholders, owners, partners,” Buffett said to kick the meeting off in the morning. “If you’re the owner of a company and you’ve got two guys -- 98 and 91 -- running the company, you’re entitled to actually see them in person.” Inflation Woes Buffett again addressed the impact of inflation, after warning shareholders last year that the economy was red hot. Inflation hurts bondholders, as well as people who stash cash under couches. “It swindles almost everybody,” Buffett said. “If you really could have a totally stable unit of monetary use for the next hundred years, it would be better for business and investors in general.” What Bloomberg Intelligence says: “Berkshire Hathaway’s diverse business units contribute to long-term earnings power, and while supply-chain challenges and inflation remain risks, the company largely shrugged them off in 1Q as operating companies’ profit stayed at near-record levels.” -- Matthew Palazola, Kylie Towbin, BI analysts Berkshire’s businesses haven’t been immune to the pressures. Dairy Queen CEO Troy Bader said in an interview on Friday that it’s a real challenge. Brooks Sports Inc. CEO Jim Weber acknowledged the effects on his business, which makes running shoes, but expressed some optimism that the supply challenges and inflation pressures that have weighed on the economy will lessen. “There’s been such a bubble in demand post-Covid, people have been buying stuff at an incredible rate,” Weber said. “It isn’t going to crash, I believe, but it’s going to normalize. And when it normalizes, I think all of this capacity challenge in the supply chain is going to go back to normal. I think some prices may be more attractive because there’s going to be overcapacity.” Bitcoin Criticism Buffett and Munger have been constant skeptics of cryptocurrencies, with Munger calling it a “noxious poison.” The pair aired their deep criticism again on Saturday, with Buffett noting that he’d rather own lots of farmland or apartments -- what he calls productive assets -- than Bitcoin. “What would I do with it?” Buffett said. “It isn’t going to do anything.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek War Is Making One of the Richest Countries Even Richer An Entire Neighborhood Is Being Flipped by a Los Angeles Developer How One Rogue Exec Thrust Levi’s Into the Culture Wars Jack Bogle Was a Punk The 400 Airplanes That Russia Seized Have Become an Epic Insurance Struggle ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•18 hours ago,"Buffett Lures Omaha Disciples With Stock Buys, Inflation Warning",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buffett-lures-omaha-disciples-stock-150000580.html

5/2/2022,"By Scott DiSavino, Arathy Somasekhar and Brijesh Patel (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas production growth is waning at the same time many countries are looking for new suppliers to help break their dependence on Russian gas after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The United States is already the world's largest producer of natural gas. But the two mainstays of production - the Appalachian region and West Texas - are seeing growth slow, with companies blaming lack of adequate pipeline infrastructure, despite prices near 14-year highs. Since Moscow invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, U.S. gas prices have soared about 50% as European countries look to the United States, the world's second biggest exporter, to sell more liquefied natural gas (LNG) to wean Europe off Russian fuel. Growth has slowed in Appalachia, which supplied about 37% of U.S. gas in 2021, because it has become increasingly difficult for energy firms to build new pipes to move gas out of the Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia region. With pipelines in the Permian Shale, the nation's second biggest gas supply basin, filling quickly, analysts said production growth in that Texas-New Mexico basin could slow significantly next year unless firms start building new pipelines soon. The Permian supplied about 19% of U.S. gas in 2021. Energy analysts expect benchmark gas prices will average $4.24 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in 2022, which would be the highest annual average in eight years. The largest European economies import about 18.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) from Russia. The United States currently can export about 9.8 bcfd as LNG. Several companies are looking to boost exports, but substantial new LNG export capacity is not expected for at least two years. A billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. U.S. natural gas remains well below prices in Europe, Asia https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-NATURALGAS/PIPELINES/jnpwerllopw/chart.png For much of the past decade, Appalachia has been the workhorse of U.S. gas production, growing by an average of 36% per year from 2010-2019. Pipeline construction has slowed, and output growth dropped to an average of 4% in 2020 and 2021. EQT Corp said on its earnings call that growth will not pick up until there are more pipelines. Appalachia ""is nearing takeaway capacity limits,"" said analysts at Bank of America, who estimated there would be ""little to no production growth"" until new pipes enter service. One giant project, the Atlantic Coast pipeline, was canceled in 2020 after costs rose from an estimated $6.0-$6.5 billion to $8 billion. Another long-delayed project, Equitrans Midstream Corp's $6.2 billion Mountain Valley line from West Virginia to Virginia, has not been completed due to ongoing lawsuits. ""This project may be the last large greenfield natural gas pipeline to go into service east of the Mississippi River for some time,"" said analysts at ClearView Energy Partners, who estimate Mountain Valley will enter service in mid 2023. Growth of Appalachia pipeline export capacity stalls https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-NATURALGAS/PIPELINES/zdpxogaajvx/chart.png The Permian Shale is the biggest U.S. oil field. That oil comes out of the ground with a lot of gas, known as associated gas. With crude prices hovering around $100 a barrel, analysts expect energy firms to drill for more oil in the Permian with the associated gas filling existing pipes in 2023. Permian gas output grew by an average of 17% per year from 2012-2020, before slowing to just 8% in 2021. In the past, drillers would flare, or burn some of that gas. But pressure from states and investors to be more environmentally-friendly and cut greenhouse gas emissions have forced companies to reduce flaring. Several energy companies are interested in building new pipes in the Permian, including units of Enterprise Products Partners, Kinder Morgan and Energy Transfer.

5/2/2022,"By Bharat Gautam (Reuters) - Gold prices fell on Monday as elevated U.S. Treasury yields pressured demand for zero-yield bullion, ahead of a widely expected big interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve to contain rising inflationary pressures. Spot gold retreated 0.4% to $1,888.56 per ounce, as of 0241 GMT. U.S. gold futures dropped 1.3% to $1,886.90. The market is concerned that the Fed could be quite hawkish, pricing in a 50 basis point hike, and it could be 75 basis points in July, said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. The U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to begin its two-day meeting on interest rates on May 3 and announce its decision the next day. Fed policymakers look set to deliver a series of aggressive rate hikes at least until the summer to deal with rapid inflation and surging labour costs, even as two reports released on Friday showed tentative signs that both may be cresting. The Fed is still behind, and has constantly tried to keep up with these expectations, so there's a good chance they are looking at current inflation metrics, and ""are going to continue to beat the hawkish drum,"" Innes said. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose towards recent multi-year peaks, pressuring demand for gold.

5/2/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- A widespread selloff in China is rippling through emerging markets, threatening to snuff out growth and drag down everything from stocks to currencies and bonds. Most Read from Bloomberg Naomi Judd, of Grammy-Winning Duo The Judds, Dies at 76 Bored Ape Metaverse Frenzy Raises Millions, Crashes Ethereum Musk Engages in Twitter Spat After Rebuttal From Ocasio-Cortez Omicron Sublineages Evade Antibodies From Earlier Infections Biggest Treasury Buyer Outside U.S. Quietly Offloading Billions Fresh Covid outbreaks -- and the government’s stringent policy to contain them -- are spooking global investors who fear shutdowns in China will echo across the world by lowering demand and disrupting supply chains. That’s pushing them to sell not just China’s currency, bonds and stocks but the assets of any developing nation that relies heavily on trade with the world’s second-biggest economy. The result is the sharpest slide in emerging markets in two years, not unlike the meltdown in 2015 when China’s woes led to a rout in their bonds and currencies, besides wiping out $2 trillion from equity values. Since then, the country’s influence on the global economy has only grown: It’s now the largest buyer of commodities, meaning its slump may impact exporters of raw materials and their markets more than ever. “Given China’s importance in global supply chains and importance to global growth prospects, further disappointments in the nation’s growth may lead to more contagion risk,” Johnny Chen and Clifford Lau, money managers at William Blair Investment Management in Singapore, wrote in an email. “We see countries with high trade linkages to China as being the most vulnerable.” As armies of white-suited enforcers descended on Shanghai and Beijing in late April to oversee the mandatory testing of millions, the offshore yuan sank to the worst monthly loss in at least 12 years. The MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index, with almost a 30% weight for the Chinese currency, tumbled in tandem. The yuan’s 30-day correlation to the index rose to the strongest level since September, underscoring the currency’s influence in the emerging-market selloff. After Shanghai reported its first deaths since the latest outbreak, panic selling spread to bonds and equities. China’s Sudden Currency Plunge Raises Risk of a 2015-Style Panic The scale of the losses prompted Chinese authorities to step in and assure markets they’ll support the economic recovery and boost infrastructure spending. They also signaled willingness to resolve regulatory issues in the technology sector. These pledges soothed investors’ nerves even though authorities didn’t abandon the stern Covid Zero policy that had sparked the panic in the first place. While the last trading day of April did see a rebound in the yuan, most analysts expect the currency to resume its slump. The offshore yuan dropped 0.6% to 6.6827 per dollar on Monday. China’s local markets are shut for a holiday. Beijing’s 2022 growth target of 5.5% is now in question, prompting analysts from Standard Chartered Plc to HSBC Holdings Plc to predict currency losses over the next three months. That, in turn, could lower growth rates in countries like South Africa and Brazil, just when they’re also buffeted by higher U.S. yields, an inflationary spiral and the war in Ukraine. “If China’s economy slows significantly, emerging markets currencies as well as the yuan could experience a period of elevated and persistent volatility,” said Brendan McKenna, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. Commodity Pain The rand erased four months worth of gains in just two weeks, while the Brazilian real, Colombian peso and the Chilean peso posted some of the sharpest declines among peers. Carry-trade losses ballooned, capping the worst showing since November. Money managers quickly moved to downgrade their currency outlook for emerging markets. HSBC cut its forecast for nine Asian currencies, citing China’s economic travails. TD Securities and Neuberger Berman said South Korea’s won and Taiwan’s dollar will come under greater pressure. “We continue to maintain a cautious stance on Asian currencies, and expect more volatility till the time some of these growth concerns abate,” Prashant Singh, senior portfolio manager for emerging-markets debt at Neuberger Berman in Singapore. Multi-Asset Rout Currency losses are also driving a selloff in local bonds, which sank to the worst first four months of a year on record, as performance in April alone was the worst since the peak of the pandemic in March 2020. The main drag here was China again, with a 41% weight in the Bloomberg index for the asset class. The nation’s bonds posted the biggest monthly retreat since the 2008 financial crisis, while sparking double-digit losses in countries as varied as South Africa, Poland and Chile. Equities weren’t spared either. A rout in Chinese technology shares listed in Hong Kong echoed half a world away in Johannesburg. Naspers Ltd., which owns 28.8% in Tencent Holdings, plunged to a five-year low. A three-week slump partly fueled by panic over Covid cases in China (and partly by rising U.S. yields) led emerging-market stocks to erase $2.7 trillion in market value. China’s economic activity contracted sharply in April as the lockdown of Shanghai escalated concerns about further disruption to global supply chains. Factory activity fell to the lowest level in more than two years, with the official manufacturing PMI dropping to 47.4 from 49.5 in March, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Saturday. “China’s slowdown will compound the challenging outlook for emerging economies facing soaring energy prices and tighter monetary policy from the major central banks,” said Mansoor Mohi-uddin, chief economist at Bank of Singapore Ltd. Xi’s Vow to Boost Growth While Locking Down Met With Skepticism Here are the main things to watch in emerging markets in the week ahead: South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan will be releasing latest inflation data for April, with March price growth having risen to at least a near-decade high across all three economies Russia’s PMI survey will be one of the first glimpses of activity in April, the second full month of President Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine Bond investors will be on the lookout for coupon payments in dollars as the clock is ticking for the country’s 30-day grace period, which ends May 4 Turkey’s inflation is set to rise to 65% in April, the highest since 2002, but still unlikely to trigger a response from a politically-constrained central bank In Brazil, the highlight of the coming week is the monetary policy meeting, where the yield curve shows investors believe the central bank will deliver on its pledge to raise the policy rate by 100 basis points In Chile, the central bank is likely to continue its tightening cycle at a more moderate pace and increase the benchmark interest rate to 8% (Updates with offshore yuan’s drop in seventh paragraph) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek War Is Making One of the Richest Countries Even Richer An Entire Neighborhood Is Being Flipped by a Los Angeles Developer How One Rogue Exec Thrust Levi’s Into the Culture Wars Jack Bogle Was a Punk The 400 Airplanes That Russia Seized Have Become an Epic Insurance Struggle ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•5 hours ago,China Contagion Threatens to Derail the World’s Emerging Markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-contagion-threatens-derail-world-160000902.html
5/2/2022,"Warren Buffett gave a blunt answer to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders on a potential nuclear war. ""There's going to be more accidents in connection with atomic [weapons] — we've come close various times,"" Buffett warned at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting on Saturday. ""We can't do anything about it."" A nuclear attack of any kind could hammer Berkshire's insurance operations. While the company isn't out there under-writing risk associated with a possible nuclear war, attacks of this kind would likely make it must costlier for Berkshire to underwrite others types of insurance. ""For certain things, we don't write policies on because we wouldn't be able to make good on them anyway,"" Buffett said. ""And everybody would know we wouldn't be able to make on them. So you have that risk. And there's nothing Berkshire can protect you against."" Ajit Jain — who runs Berkshire's insurance operations — echoed his boss' dour sentiment. ""When it comes to a nuclear thing you know, I I sort of surrender... it's very difficult for us to estimate how bad that can be,"" Jain said. ""Very many different lines of exposures will be affected by it."" Jain continued: ""And even though in almost all our kind of contracts, we try and exclude nuclear as a covered peril. Nevertheless, if something like that were to happen, I'm fairly positive that the regulators and the courts will hold it against the insurance, and we will be... required to pay. For example, one thing which is already being talked about, we issue what are called FICA policies. And these fire policies try and exclude nuclear as a covered peril. But there are several regulators who feel that 'Gee, if it's a fire policy and if the nuclear attack causes a fire, then how can you exclude fire?' ... we will have to live with that, and it will be very difficult for the insurance industry to fight back with the regulators and the court systems in terms of what is covered or not covered.""

5/2/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden is considering forgiving at least $10,000 in student loans per borrower, a promise he made on the campaign trail, through executive action. Most Read from Bloomberg Naomi Judd, of Grammy-Winning Duo The Judds, Dies at 76 Bored Ape Metaverse Frenzy Raises Millions, Crashes Ethereum Musk Engages in Twitter Spat After Rebuttal From Ocasio-Cortez Omicron Sublineages Evade Antibodies From Earlier Infections Biggest Treasury Buyer Outside U.S. Quietly Offloading Billions Here are key data points: $1.75 trillion -- the total amount of outstanding student-loan debt in U.S., according to the Federal Reserve. About 92% of that debt -- more than $1.6 trillion -- is in the hands of the federal government. Put another way, student-loan debt equals about 6.5% of U.S. gross domestic product. 43.4 million -- the number of borrowers with federal student-loan debt, according to the Education Data Initiative. $37,113 -- the average balance for borrowers of federal student loans. Including private debt, the number jumps to $40,904. Four -- the number of months Biden has to make a decision. The moratorium on student-loan payments is set to expire on Aug. 31, and the president has said he intends to either extend the moratorium or do some sort of debt cancellation before that date. The deadline leaves just over two months until November’s midterm elections that will decide which party controls Congress. 41% -- Biden’s approval rating among Americans aged 18 to 29, according to the Harvard Institute of Politics youth poll released Monday. His approval rating is down 18 percentage points from a year ago, according to the poll. The top reason cited for dismay was his “ineffectiveness.” Young Americans are likely to be a decisive voting bloc in the midterms. Harvard’s poll found that with more than six months until the election, youth turnout is expected to match the historically high turnout seen in the last midterm cycle: 36% said they will “definitely” vote; 37% said so at this point in 2018. 34% -- adults aged 18 to 29 who have student-loan debt, according to the Education Data Initiative. 85% -- young Americans, regardless of party, who favor some sort of government action on student debt, according to the Harvard poll; 38% favor total debt cancellation. Only 13% believe the government should not take any action on it. Among young Americans who are not currently enrolled in college and without a degree, support for government action is 79%. $22,690 to $39,150 -- the average cost of attendance for full-time in-state and out-of-state undergraduate students at public four-year institutions, according to the College Board. The average cost of private non-profit four-year universities is $51,690. $52,000 -- the average student debt owed by Black bachelor’s-degree holders. By race, Black college graduates owe considerably more than others on average. Four years after graduation, almost half owe an average of 12.5% more than they borrowed, according to the Education Data Initiative. Proponents of a broad cancellation include prominent Democrats, President Barack Obama’s former education secretary and a former official in the Trump administration’s education department. Biden has said he is not considering forgiving $50,000 worth of debt for every borrower. A recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that rates of missed payments on student loans are at risk of climbing when the forbearance ends. “Serious delinquency rates for student debt could snap back from historic lows to their previous highs in which 10% or more of the debt was past due,” Lowell Ricketts, a data scientist for the Institute for Economic Equity at the St. Louis Fed, said in the post. Interest rates for federal student loans vary depending on the loan type and generally are set in May for loans disbursed from July to same month of the following year, according to the Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid office. Students currently pay 3.73% for the most limited subsidized loans, to 5.28% for unsubsidized loans. Unlike other forms of debt, such as credit cards and mortgages, the loans are daily interest loans, which means that interest accumulates daily. Parents of students and graduate students pay 6.28%. This raises the outstanding amount due on the loan and interest is then charged on that higher principal balance, increasing the overall cost of the loan. Most federal student loans also have an origination fee that is a percentage of the total loan amount. This fee is deducted from each loan that is disbursed. This means the money received will be less than the amount the student actually borrowed and is charged interest on. The interest rates on federal student loans is set by federal law by using the May 10-year Treasury note auction and adding 2.05 percentage points to 4.6 percentage points based on the loan type.

5/2/2022,"The Oracle of Omaha didn't become the multi-billionaire he is today by timing the market. ""We haven't the faintest idea what the stock market is gonna do when it opens on Monday — we never have,"" Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett said during the company's annual shareholders meeting on Saturday. ""I don't think we've ever made a decision where either one of us has either said or been thinking: 'We should buy or sell based on what the market is going to do,"" Buffett added, referring to his longtime business partner Charlie Munger. ""Or, for that matter, what the economy is going to do."" Buffett is known to deeply research companies and their performance, preferring to hold stocks long-term rather than to ride market waves. In other words, he is an ultimate a value investor in that he looks for stocks that are cheaply priced relative to their true value as evaluated by Berkshire. The investment strategy has grown his company — and his net worth — into the conglomerate it is today by buying and holding massive positions in Apple, Bank of America, American Express, Coca-Cola, Dairy Queen, HP, and more. Buffett added that ""if he had any sense of timing,"" he would have bought stocks in March 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic started spreading. Markets faced a massive rout in March 2020, as the pandemic began spreading across the United States at alarming rates, forcing businesses, schools, and large parts of the economy to shut down. Despite the market lows, Buffett said he didn't use the chance to load up on equities. ""I totally missed that opportunity, I totally messed up in March of 2020,"" he said. ""We haven't ever timed anything. We've never figured out insights into the economy."" — Aarthi is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. She can be reached at aarthi@yahoofinance.com.

5/2/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital chalked a 10.6% gain in April, according to a person with knowledge of the firm’s performance, weathering the worst month for U.S. stocks in years. Most Read from Bloomberg Naomi Judd, of Grammy-Winning Duo The Judds, Dies at 76 Bored Ape Metaverse Frenzy Raises Millions, Crashes Ethereum Musk Engages in Twitter Spat After Rebuttal From Ocasio-Cortez Omicron Sublineages Evade Antibodies From Earlier Infections Biggest Treasury Buyer Outside U.S. Quietly Offloading Billions That brought his total return this year to 15.4%, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing the confidential results. A spokesperson for Greenlight declined to comment. Einhorn, who founded the New York-based firm in 1996, has been signaling a bearish posture in recent weeks. In a letter to investors this month, the 53-year-old laid out concerns about the pace of Federal Reserve efforts to fight inflation and the potential for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to hurt the U.S. economy. “The market is beginning to price in its doubts about the Fed’s resolve and likely failure to return inflation to its 2% target. Even as the Fed resets the market’s expectation to a faster tightening cycle, inflation expectations are increasing and long-term bond prices are falling,” Einhorn wrote in the letter. There was a lot of potential for some pessimistic bets to pay off. The S&P 500’s monthly drop of 8.8% marked the index’s worst April performance since 1970. The Nasdaq 100 fell 13.4% for its biggest slump since 2008. And fixed income wasn’t spared either, with a benchmark tracking bonds worldwide dropping more than 5% for the worst month since at least 1990. Einhorn’s performance over the past four months is better than what he achieved for all of last year. Greenlight ended 2021 up 11.9%, as technology shares and other growth companies faltered toward year-end and value stocks started climbing. In that case, Einhorn said in his fourth-quarter letter that almost all of the gains came from stocks he was long. Einhorn is still clawing his way back from a 20% loss in 2015 and an additional 34% loss in 2018. He still needs a gain of 11.8% to get back to even.

5/2/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Jerome Powell doesn’t like to bless bets in financial markets, but he could shift the needle this week on how high investors expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to cool overheated prices. Most Read from Bloomberg Naomi Judd, of Grammy-Winning Duo The Judds, Dies at 76 Bored Ape Metaverse Frenzy Raises Millions, Crashes Ethereum Musk Engages in Twitter Spat After Rebuttal From Ocasio-Cortez Omicron Sublineages Evade Antibodies From Earlier Infections Biggest Treasury Buyer Outside U.S. Quietly Offloading Billions The Fed chair and his colleagues want to lift rates expeditiously to a neutral level this year that neither stimulates nor restrains growth -- around 2.5% -- and then slow the pace of tightening. But in crises, central banks that pause typically lose as the forces they’re battling -- be it spreading financial panic or broadening inflation -- gain more momentum. “You don’t pause along the way” in an inflation fight, said former Fed Governor Laurence Meyer who now runs policy analysis firm LH Meyer. “You do look around, but there is an urgency of moving beyond” a neutral rate of interest. U.S. central bankers don’t want to trigger a recession and Powell has voiced confidence in the Fed’s ability to pull off a soft landing that brings inflation toward its 2% target without stalling the economy. But he has also prioritized price stability. “If we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that,” Powell said March 21. He publicly backed front-loading policy tightening in April 21 remarks that helped cement expectations for a half-point hike when officials conclude their two-day meeting Wednesday, followed by at least that large a move in June. Minutes of their March gathering also signaled the committee will likely agree to start shrinking their $9 trillion balance-sheet in May, quickly moving to a maximum runoff pace of $95 billion a month. Having already provided a lot of clues for what to expect, most of the new information will come via Powell’s post-meeting press conference at 2:30 p.m. in Washington -- his first to be held in-person since the pandemic began. Powell will have just spent two days gauging the mood of his colleagues. If he comes out and signals policy may require a more restrictive stance -- meaning above its neutral setting -- it would be a significant shift. The market consensus currently shows rates peaking above 3.4%, but that is above the median Fed forecast that was updated in March. “The Fed has very little room to under-deliver” on policy restraint, said Ed Al-Hussainy, global rates strategist at Columbia Threadneedle. “They have to say they’re willing to risk tipping the economy into recession to signal credibility on inflation.” Fed forecasts from March show five officials projecting rates above 3% in 2023 and 2024 to get inflation moving back toward their target. That was more hawkish than the median official, who saw rates at 2.8% in both years, but it’s plausible that more policy makers have joined those ranks given incoming economic data. Economists at Deutsche Bank AG argue the Fed will have to raise rates much more aggressively -- well into the 5% or 6% range -- to curb inflation, leading to a deep recession next year. First-quarter gross domestic product numbers released Thursday showed solid underlying demand, with real final sales to domestic purchasers accelerating to a 2.6% annual rate. Capacity utilization is rising, and capital spending is holding up. The employment cost index, an important indicator of total compensation costs watched by Powell, rose 4.5% from a year earlier, a gain that is likely to underpin demand and possibly sustain inflation pressures. And the jobs market remains tight. Payrolls rose by 385,000 in April, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The monthly employment report will be published May 6. “The recovery continues to be robust,” Visa Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Alfred Kelly told analysts April 26. “At this stage in terms of volumes, we have seen no noticeable impact due to inflation, supply chain issues or the war in Ukraine.” For central bankers this is all good news except for one thing: It has been accompanied by rising inflation rates and a drift up in some longer-run inflation expectations measures. The Fed’s preferred price measure rose 6.6% in March, more than three times their goal. A University of Michigan survey of the expected change in prices for the next 5-10 years has averaged 3% for the past 12 months versus 2.7% for the last expansion. And a New York Fed survey of three-year-ahead inflation expectations averaged 3.6% in the first quarter versus 2.9% in the first quarter of 2019. ‘Underlying Inflation’ “All of the measures are telling us underlying inflation is not where it should be,” said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic adviser at Brean Capital. “The eventual point they need to get to rein in inflation is probably going to have to be” more restrictive than their current estimates of 2.8%. The Fed’s narrative about moving cautiously once they get rates up to around 2.5% also reflects their high uncertainty. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s round of virus lockdowns could both slow global growth and further snarl supply chains, creating more scarcity and higher prices. At the same time, slowing growth in China and Europe could create disinflationary forces. Anna Wong, the chief U.S. economist for Bloomberg Economics, said just a 4% decline in the level of GDP in China can lead to a 30% reduction in oil and commodity prices, potentially off-setting the inflationary effects of Europe’s potential oil embargo on Russia. An easing of raw materials prices may “seduce” the committee to pause as they approach a 2.5% policy rate later this year, Wong said. But wage pressures are likely to continue to grow, at least in nominal terms, she said, and sustain core service price increases. “The path to a soft landing is very narrow,” Wong said, and depends on faster labor force growth to help satisfy demand for workers, which may be unlikely. “The Fed will have to keep hiking and cannot afford to stop until they are closer to 4%.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek War Is Making One of the Richest Countries Even Richer An Entire Neighborhood Is Being Flipped by a Los Angeles Developer How One Rogue Exec Thrust Levi’s Into the Culture Wars Jack Bogle Was a Punk The 400 Airplanes That Russia Seized Have Become an Epic Insurance Struggle ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•20 hours ago,Powell’s Fed Set to Go Big and Keep Going Until Inflation Tamed,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/powell-fed-set-big-keep-130000993.html
5/2/2022,"OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway's vice-chairman Charles Munger said on Saturday that retail broker Robinhood Markets Inc, which is trading near a record low, was getting its comeuppance. After a peak in 2020 in trading volumes, Robinhood posted a 43% fall in first-quarter revenue earlier this month as transaction volumes declined across asset classes amid poor performance of shares. The company said it was laying off 9% of its full-time workforce. ""Look what happened to Robinhood from peak to trough, wasn't it obvious something like that was going to happen?"" said Munger.

5/2/2022,"The first shipments of Russian coal and crude oil, paid for in yuan, will arrive in China in April and May, respectively. Chinese state media used the opportunity to denigrate the United States, claiming that the international status of the U.S. dollar is “at risk.” However, financial expert Albert Song believes that it will not affect the U.S. dollar’s status as the leading global reserve currency. Fenwei Energy Information Service Co., China’s leading information and service provider to the coal and coke industries, revealed that several Chinese companies purchased Russian coal in Chinese currency in March, and the first shipment would be made in April. This is also the first shipment of Russian commodities paid in yuan to arrive in China after Russia was sanctioned by Western countries. Fenwei did not specify on which date the shipment was expected to arrive. In addition to coal, Chinese buyers also used yuan to purchase Russian crude oil. The first ESPO (Eastern Siberia Pacific Ocean) crude oil will be delivered in May, according to a commentary published in early April on Cngold.org, a Chinese online media outlet about investing. Citing the purchases from Fenwei, the article stated that payments in U.S. dollars will become less popular. “Russia announced that it would only accept payments in rubles for Russian oil and natural gas, which turned the United States and European countries from those who impose sanctions to those who are subjected to sanctions,” the commentary said. “Chinese yuan seized the opportunity and began to reveal its potential in global trade payments. Now that coal and oil paid for in yuan will arrive in China, the international community [will] become green-eyed [at our success].” On April 23, Albert Song, a researcher at Tianjun, a politics and economics think tank, told The Epoch Times that the recent Chinese purchases of Russian commodities in yuan will not affect the international status of the U.S. dollar, “because these are only bilateral trades between China and Russia, not multilateral trades involving other countries. ” Song has 27 years of professional experience in China’s financial industry, focusing on research in China’s politics and economics. According to data released by China’s General Administration of Customs in mid-April, the quantity of imported coal and lignite to China dropped 39.9 percent year-on-year in March and 24.2 percent year-on-year in the first quarter. However, Russian imports not only retained the top spot in China’s coking coal imports in March, the quantity more than doubled year on year. China’s total imports from Russia are also growing significantly. The latest mid-April report from the General Administration of Customs showed that in the first quarter of 2022, its total imports from Russia increased to $21.73 billion, a jump of 31 percent year-on-year, ranking second only to Indonesia’s 31.4 percent. Related: Can Lebanon Repair Its Failing Energy Sector? When touting the growing influence of the Chinese currency, the article on Cngold.org also revealed that the Chinese regime is currently negotiating with Saudi Arabia, planning to use the renminbi to price crude oil, in part. Song disagrees with the commentary’s conclusion that the Chinese yuan is an emerging star on the international market. “The most important thing is that a country’s sovereign currency is recognized by many countries. Although the Chinese Communist Party claims that the renminbi is on the path of internationalization, the share of the renminbi’s international payments over the years has only been 3.2 percent because it is a government-controlled currency and cannot be freely exchanged. It is therefore a currency with poor credit, to begin with,” Song commented. On April 7, the European Union announced the fifth round of sanctions against Russia, including a ban on coal imports from Russia. The toughest sanction so far is to cut Russian banks from the global financial system. After Visa and Mastercard suspended services in Russia, Russian banks indicated that they planned to issue cards using China’s UnionPay system. As China’s largest credit card brand, Unionpay cards are issued in over 70 countries and regions. However, Russian news agency RBC reported on April 20 that China’s UnionPay refused to cooperate with Russian banks for fear of being sanctioned, leaving Russia with fewer options for a credit card provider for its global business. “China UnionPay chooses not to cooperate with Russian banks, for fear that itself will get implicated in the sanctions. The CCP needs the New York Clearing House interbank payments system to obtain dollars. Sanctions against China will block it from earning foreign exchanges through exports,” Song explained. He further elaborated that there are three driving forces for China’s economic growth—foreign trade, investment, and consumption. “All three are in decline. If additional sanctions are imposed on China, it will be an unbearable situation for China’s economy,” he said.

5/2/2022,"Investing in natural resources can seem daunting for those just getting started. Whether you’re looking at lumber, oil or natural gas, the prices of these commodities can be extremely volatile. And that volatility is also reflected in the share price performance of companies that produce and process those same commodities. So how should a novice investor approach the market of natural resources? MoneyWise recently spoke with investing legend Rick Rule — former president and CEO of Sprott U.S. Holdings — to learn how to tackle this increasingly critical sector. Rule thinks the raw materials space is a great place to be for the next five years due to the inflationary, interest rate and geopolitical risks the market faces. But you can’t just follow the herd. “You're going to be a contrarian, or you're going to be a victim,” Rule says. Let’s take a closer look at what Rule means by that. A contrarian investor deliberately goes against prevailing market trends. They buy when most investors are selling, and sell when others are buying. It’s a strategy a lot easier said than done: When the price of an asset plunges, you simply don’t know where the floor is. But according to Rule, being contrarian is particularly important when it comes to investing in natural resources. “The cure for low prices in commodities is always low prices,” he says, pointing to oil as an example. When crude was trading at $20 a barrel at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, producer costs were roughly $50 to $60 a barrel on average. So by producing 70 million barrels a day, the industry was taking daily losses of $2 billion. As a result, producers couldn’t even maintain sustaining capital investments while new projects were certainly out of the question. “If you don't continually reinvest in a business, where the only guarantee is depletion, you lose the ability to produce,” Rule says. But as we’ve clearly seen, it's those low prices that have led to constrained supply and increased demand. Oil prices are now at over $100 a barrel, translating into big profits for contrarians who loaded up on the cheap. “Markets are messy, but markets always work.” Of course, not all beaten-down assets are guaranteed to turn around. Shares of embattled BlackBerry, for example, plunged from over $147 apiece in June 2008 to around $10 in 2012. Today, they're trading at $5.88. So what should investors pick up if they want to take a contrarian approach? Rule’s answer is simple: Consider things that we can’t live without. “You need to look at asset classes that are necessary for the maintenance of the living standards of humankind that are out of favor.” Again, oil serves as a good example. Rule explains that if you have a natural resource like oil, which is essential to the material well being of human beings, and that commodity is priced substantially below its cost of production, only two things can happen: The price goes up, or the commodity becomes unavailable (and the world's material standard of living goes down). The easy money on oil was made two years ago when its price was deep in the doldrums. Rule cautions that if the Russia-Ukraine conflict resolves, we could see “a fairly immediate and precipitous decline” in oil and gas prices. That said, he still sees opportunity in the energy space — particularly north of the border. “Canadian oil and gas industry is priced relative to cash flow as though the oil price was at $60, but it's at $100. In other words, a big decline is already built in the prices of the producers.” While the significant volatility of energy stocks can make holding them uneasy, Rule advises patience. “If you are willing to own these stocks for three or four years, the extraordinary free cash yields that they generate at lower energy prices and their current reticence to engage in too much reckless expansion, but rather, their preference for returning cash to shareholders means that the sector is particularly attractive.” In any sector, there are small companies, medium companies and large companies, each offering unique risk-reward profiles. When an industry is expanding, both little players and established leaders can thrive. But for investors who are just getting started in the commodities space, Rule says it’s best to stick with blue chip names. “I think for beginning investors, in particular, at least 75% of their natural resource-oriented portfolio should be in very large companies, where the company operates in the best quartile worldwide in terms of production costs, and historically has operated in the best quartile worldwide in terms of return on capital employed.” “In other words, not just big companies, but big, good companies.” This advice applies to more than just oil and gas. Gold, for instance, is getting renewed investor attention amid spiking inflation and global unrest. The price of the yellow metal has surged to around $2,000 an ounce as of this writing. Gold investors who are keeping it simple with big miners are indeed doing well. Shares of Barrick Gold (GOLD) are up 20% year to date, while Newmont (NEM) is up 22% over the same period. Rule says that when generalist money comes into the precious metals market, it doesn’t go into “dreadful looking” penny stock names. “It goes to Barrick.” We are already in a commodity price boom. But investors who are eager to jump into the space should be extra careful at these elevated levels. “The cure for high prices is always high prices,” Rule cautions. “There will be a time when $110 oil is silly, it will cause people to drive less, and it will cause other people to drill more.” Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms.

5/2/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The global shift away from easy money is poised to accelerate as a pandemic bond-buying blitz by central banks swings into reverse, threatening another shock to the world’s economies and financial markets. Most Read from Bloomberg Naomi Judd, of Grammy-Winning Duo The Judds, Dies at 76 Bored Ape Metaverse Frenzy Raises Millions, Crashes Ethereum Musk Engages in Twitter Spat After Rebuttal From Ocasio-Cortez Omicron Sublineages Evade Antibodies From Earlier Infections Biggest Treasury Buyer Outside U.S. Quietly Offloading Billions Bloomberg Economics estimates that policy makers in the Group of Seven countries will shrink their balance sheets by about $410 billion in the remainder of 2022. It’s a stark turnaround from last year, when they added $2.8 trillion — taking the total expansion to more than $8 trillion since Covid-19 arrived. That wave of monetary support helped prop up economies and asset prices through a pandemic slump. Central banks are pulling it back — belatedly, in the view of some critics — as inflation soars to multi-decade highs. The dual impact of shrinking balance sheets and higher interest rates adds up to an unprecedented challenge for a global economy already hit by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s new Covid lockdowns. Unlike previous tightening cycles when the U.S. Federal Reserve was alone in shrinking its balance sheet, this time others are expected to do likewise. ‘Major Shock’ Their new policy, known as quantitative tightening — the opposite of the quantitative easing that central banks turned to during the pandemic and the Great Recession — will likely send borrowing costs higher and dry up liquidity. Already, rising bond yields, falling share prices and the stronger U.S. dollar are tightening financial conditions — even before the Fed’s push to raise interest rates gets into full swing. “This is a major financial shock for the world,” said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis SA, who previously worked for the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. “You are already seeing the consequences of tapering in reduced dollar liquidity and dollar appreciation.” The Fed is expected to raise rates by 50 basis points at its May 3 to 4 policy meeting and several times thereafter, with traders seeing about 250 basis points of tightening between now and year’s end. Officials are also expected to start trimming the balance sheet at a maximum pace of $95 billion a month, a quicker shift than most envisaged at the start of the year. The U.S. central bank will achieve this by letting its holdings of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities mature, rather than actively selling the assets it bought. Policy makers have left open the option that they might, at a later stage, sell mortgage bonds and return to an all-Treasuries portfolio. In 2013, the Fed’s balance-sheet plans caught investors by surprise and triggered an episode of financial turmoil that became known as the “taper tantrum.” This time around, the policy has been well telegraphed, in the U.S. and elsewhere. Asset managers have had time to price in the effects, which should make a wrenching shock on the markets less likely. First in History So far, the Fed’s proposed runoff has led investors to demand a cushion for risks of owning long-term U.S. Treasuries. Term premium — the extra compensation that investors require to own longer-maturity debt rather than continually rolling over shorter-dated obligations — has been on the rise. Fed officials have said that QE helped depress yields by lowering term premium, providing a cushion for the economy during the 2020 recession. Investors expect QT to do the reverse. The Fed’s pace of balance sheet unwind is expected to be roughly twice as fast as in 2017, when it last ran down its holdings. The magnitude of that contraction and its expected trajectory are a first in the history of monetary policies, according to Gavekal Research Ltd. fund manager Didier Darcet. Others are moving in the same direction: The European Central Bank has signaled it will end QE in the third quarter, a timeline that is complicated by the spillover from war in Ukraine. The Bank of England has already started to shrink its balance sheet by ending gilt reinvestments in February. It is expected to hike rates again in May, bringing the key rate to the threshold where policy makers will weigh active sales from their asset portfolio. The Bank of Canada’s passive roll-off of its balance sheet — opting not to buy new bonds when the ones it owns mature — is expected to see its holdings of government debt shrink by 40% over the next two years. The Bank of Japan is the standout and remains wedded to asset purchases — it had to scale them up in recent weeks to defend its policy of controlling bond yields. The yen has weakened to the lowest in 20 years in the process. China, which avoided QE through the crisis, has switched to stimulus mode with targeted measures aimed at providing funding for smaller businesses, as it fights to contain the country’s worst Covid outbreak since 2020. Chinese leaders on Friday promised to boost stimulus to spur growth. Investors fear the unknown as liquidity is drained from bond markets that have been flooded with central-bank money over a period that stretches back to the 2008 financial crisis. Markets like housing and crypto currencies that soared in the easy-money years will face a test as liquidity tightens. “With all this central bank tightening coming into a slowdown already, it will really be all about if the central banks will tip us into recession,” said Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab & Co., which manages over $7 trillion in total assets. Some are paring back on risk assets in anticipation. Robeco Institutional Asset Management has bought short-dated bonds and cut back on its holdings of high yields, credits, and emerging market hard-currency bonds as it expects the economy to slow down or even head into a recession this year. Wealth manager Brewin Dolphin Ltd. is becoming more defensive as it looks to reduce equity holdings when there’s a rally. Citigroup strategist Matt King said liquidity flows are far more important, and have better correlation with equities, than real yields. He estimates that every $1 trillion of QT will equate to a decline of roughly 10% in stocks over the next 12 months or so. ‘Watching Paint Dry’? To Chris Iggo, the chief investment officer at Axa Investment Managers, it’s a good time to buy bonds as a safety hedge in case stocks react badly to QT and higher interest rates. “Equities tend to do worse when the economy really tanks, and earnings are cut. That is preceded by higher rates,” said Iggo. “On that timeline we are not there yet. But adding fixed income slowly as yields go higher will eventually give a more efficient hedge in a multi-asset portfolio when and if equity returns do turn more negative.” Central bankers have argued that shrinking their balance sheets by allowing bonds to roll off, rather than abruptly selling them, shouldn’t be too disruptive. The process was once described by then-Fed chair and current U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen as akin to “watching paint dry.” Still, the combination of QT, rising short-term rates, a strong dollar, higher commodity prices and U.S. fiscal contraction presents the U.S. and world with a major headwind, said Gene Tannuzzo, global head of fixed income at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. “That’s a lot to deal with for the economy,” Tannuzzo said. “We don’t have to have a recession to say growth is going to be pretty sluggish at the end of the year.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek War Is Making One of the Richest Countries Even Richer An Entire Neighborhood Is Being Flipped by a Los Angeles Developer How One Rogue Exec Thrust Levi’s Into the Culture Wars Jack Bogle Was a Punk The 400 Airplanes That Russia Seized Have Become an Epic Insurance Struggle ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•13 hours ago,End of Easy Money Brings a $410 Billion Global Financial Shock,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/end-easy-money-brings-410-200017533.html

Bitcoin returns to late Friday levels Bitcoin investors continued their recent dour mood this weekend amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and a widely-expected, half-point interest rate hike by the U.S. central bank this week. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap was recently trading at about $38,400, up 2.2% for the past 24 hours but approximately where it started the weekend. Bitcoin finished April down 17%, its worst month yet in a ragged 2022 for cryptos. Ether, the second largest crypto by market cap, followed a similar weekend pattern and was trading at roughly $2,840, up about 3.9% over the previous day but little changed from late Friday. Most other major cryptos were recently rising. Terra's luna token and SOL climbed over 5% and 7%, respectively at one point. Popular meme coin DOGE jumped nearly 6%. Trading was light as is often the case on weekends. ""At the moment, there are no major bullish catalysts on the horizon and BTC is likely to grind in this range or break down lower before more aggressive accumulation can begin,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of fund manager BitBull Capital wrote to CoinDesk. ""The lack of bullish catalysts is still evident and U.S. equities have show weakness as well as the U.S. dollar index rose. All these factors continue to weigh down BTC."" DiPasquale noted that the Federal Reserve Federal Open Market Committee's likely decision to try to tame inflation through a more hawkish rate increase ""could result in price volatility."" The Fed is also expected to explain how it will reduce its asset portfolio of mortgage and Treasury securities, which has ballooned to $9 trillion during the pandemic. Crypto declines in recent days have largely dovetailed with major stock indices as investors veer away from riskier assets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged a hefty 4% on Friday. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were off 3.6% and 2.7%, respectively. Gold was up slightly. The Nasdaq 100, an index of mostly tech, biotech and healthcare companies, plummeted 13% in April. Economic growth has slowed worldwide, a result of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. On Friday, the European Union reported that the economies of 19 countries that use the euro grew by just 0.2% for the first quarter of the year. The news followed the announcement that the U.S. economy had grown by a sluggish 0.4% over the same period. Rising energy prices and supply chain delays exacerbated by the Russian offensive have hampered businesses worldwide. With Bitcoin failing to hold the $42,000 level this week, DiPasquale was measured in his expectations for the coming days. ""We have continued to see $38K levels acting as support but continued testing of this range may result in a breakdown toward $35K-$32K,"" he wrote, adding: ""Bulls will want to see the bleeding stop and serious buyers stepping in before they can be confident of a trend reversal."" S&P 500: 4,131 -3.6% DJIA: 32,977 -2.7% Nasdaq: 12,334 -4.1% Gold: $1,896 +.08% Singapore's less crypto friendly environment Three Arrows Capital is the latest crypto firm that’s decided to call Singapore quits and move to Dubai. “The energy in Dubai’s digital asset industry is electric right now,” fund co-founder Su Zhu told CoinDesk during the Crypto Bahamas conference. “We have decided to move our Three Arrows headquarters to Dubai and I’m looking forward to meeting more technology startups.” “For a while, Singapore was making pro-crypto decisions, but now something’s changed course,” added Kyle Davies, the fund’s other co-founder. To be sure, on paper Singapore hasn’t advanced any new set of rules that would affect a fund like Three Arrows Capital. The government has been clear that its policy position is to create a “conducive environment for such activities to flourish in Singapore.” But that is for institutional capital. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has also been clear that it doesn’t approve of retail investors getting deeply involved in crypto. “We have taken a tough line on unfettered access to retail public because retail investors should not be dabbling in cryptocurrencies. Many global regulators share similar concerns about retail exposure to cryptocurrencies,” the agency’s Managing Director Ravi Menon said in a recent interview, adding that it has granted retail crypto licenses but they come with strict terms and conditions. Funds like Three Arrows Capital don’t deal directly with retail crypto. They aren’t open to non-institutional or accredited investment. So why the long face? It might have something to do with DeFiance Capital, one of Three Arrows’ peers in the city. In March, DeFiance Capital was placed on an Investor Alert List by MAS. DeFiance Capital isn’t sure why it happened, and MAS won’t give CoinDesk a clear answer. Putting a fund on an investor alert list, which has negative connotations, and not explaining the reasoning, isn’t a good look. It also might be the beginning of problems in doing business in Singapore. Visas for foreign staff are increasingly difficult to attain, and the logical narrative of the city being a massive beneficiary of Hong Kong’s capital and talent flight isn’t necessarily shaping up with TradFi also looking at Dubai as the next hub instead of Singapore. At the same time, Dubai is making the relocation process as easy as possible with visas sponsored by the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) special economic zone processed in less than a week. Plus, the DIFC has a parallel legal system Bitcoin Momentum Weakens; Support at $35K-$37K Bitcoin (BTC) is testing support around its 100-week moving average, although upside momentum has slowed over the past month. The cryptocurrency could remain in a wide trading range until a decisive breakout or breakdown occurs. BTC is on track for an 18% decline this month and is down about 40% from its all-time high around $69,000 reached in November of last year. Most technical indicators are neutral on the daily and weekly chart and bearish on the monthly chart. That could increase the risk of a breakdown in price, especially if support at $37,500 fails to hold. A series of higher price lows since Jan. 24 has supported buying activity on dips. Still, resistance at $46,710 has capped rallies over the past three months. For now, BTC is on watch for a countertrend reversal signal next week, per the DeMARK indicators, which typically precedes a brief upswing in price. 8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(12:30 UTC): Jibun (Japan) Bank manufacturing PMI (April) 9:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:30 a.m. UTC): Australia and New Zealand Banking Group job advertisements (April) 1 p.m. HKT/SGT(5 a.m. UTC): Japan consumer confidence index (April) In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""The Hash"" on CoinDesk TV: Ukraine Launches Website for NFT Donations, Panama Passes Crypto Law and More Earlier this week, ""The Hash"" hosts discussed top stories, including the Ukrainian government's new initiative to use NFT donations in the war against Russia, Panama's new crypto law and private equity investment firm Apollo's new hire for its digital asset division.

5/2/2022,"By Aditi Shah PUNE, India (Reuters) - To make its first electric vehicle for the consumer market, India's Tata Motors Ltd repurposed an unused shop floor at its flagship plant. Here, there's no fancy assembly line - Nexon SUV bodies designed for gasoline models are wired and fitted with battery packs by hand. The area, which could be mistaken for a prototype lab, initially made just eight SUVs a day. But demand has shot up over the two years since the Nexon EV's launch. Tata now makes more than 100 a day though much of that is now handled at another plant nearby. Even with this humble start, which draws on India's tradition of 'jugaad' - a word referring to frugal DIY innovation and workarounds, Tata dominates the country's fledgling electric car market. That contrasts sharply with other major automakers which have poured billions of dollars into EV tooling and technology from the get-go, though Tata's success also owes much to government subsidies and high tariffs that keep out imports from rivals like Tesla Inc. Going into India's untried market for EVs, Tata knew it had to make an affordable car for an extremely cost-conscious population. Instead of building an EV plant or line which would be expensive and take time, it decided to pick an existing successful model and work on outfitting it with a battery pack. An EV plant for a nascent market would have been ""a huge amount of investment sitting on the potential of emerging volumes. We didn't want to do that,"" Anand Kulkarni, vice president of product line and operations at Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, told Reuters. Tata also limited upfront investment by relying on Tata group companies for a range of EV components and infrastructure, and by choosing a cheaper battery chemistry type. That enabled it to price the Nexon EV around $19,000 - not necessarily cheap in India but affordable for the upper-middle class and not much more expensive than the top version of the Nexon gasoline model. With just the Nexon EV and one other model for fleet sales, Tata commands 90% of India's electric car sales, giving it an all-important first-mover advantage even if EVs account for only 1% of the overall auto market. Last June, Tata outlined aggressive plans to launch 10 electric models by March 2026. This financial year alone, it wants to quadruple EV production to 80,000 cars, sources have said. Those ambitions attracted $1 billion in investment from U.S. private equity firm TPG, valuing its EV business at $9 billion - far below some EV startups but equivalent to 40% of Tata Motors' market value. ""This has definitely given us a significant head-start. It now gives us a force multiplier to aggressively move on EVs,"" said Shailesh Chandra, managing director of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and the EV subsidiary. Tata has also earmarked $1 billion of its own money to fund its EV plans and by 2025 Chandra expects electric models to make up a quarter of its sales. Longer-term, Tata is working on an EV-specific car platform and wants its first car using that architecture to launch in 2025. The company is also evaluating the need for a dedicated EV plant, Kulkarni said. In the meantime, it plans to modify combustion engine platforms to build EVs with bigger batteries and longer driving ranges. Those models are likely to hit the market in about two years. LEANING ON TATA FAMILY The Nexon EV has a relatively modest real-world driving range of around 200 km per charge. The range is, however, sufficient for most potential Indian buyers, a Tata survey of consumers showed, prompting it to choose a 30 kilowatt hour iron-based battery from China's Gotion High Tech Co which is cheaper than other lithium-ion batteries. Tata has also judged it safer for India's tropical weather conditions, Kulkarni said. Gotion is working with Tata AutoComp Systems on assembling the battery packs and on the battery management system. Tata AutoComp, which sources most of the EV parts, is one of several Tata conglomerate firms that Tata Motors leans on - a huge advantage at a time when many automakers are ploughing funds into becoming more vertically integrated and less reliant on suppliers. Tata Power Company Ltd is setting up charging stations, Jaguar Land Rover contributes to design while Tata Chemicals Ltd has plans for battery recycling and local cell manufacturing. When Tata began EV production in 2020, most parts were imported. Today, Tata AutoComp produces around 50% of the components in-house, its CEO, Arvind Goel, told Reuters. ""Our plan is to localise everything,"" he said. All of the motor's parts except the magnet are due to be produced locally over the next couple of years. Excluding the cells, the battery will be made in-house and the company is working on its own battery management system, Goel added. RISKS AHEAD Tata's EV business is, however, set to face challenges. The government wants 30% of all cars sold in the country to be electric by 2030 and while that goal may look optimistic, competition is on its way. South Korea's Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors plan to start selling EVs in India this year although their models are set to be bigger and pricier. Expectations are also high for some rivals to launch gasoline-electric hybrids. ""The major threat will come when competitors like Hyundai launch EV models in a similar price band and as Toyota and Suzuki's hybrid cars come into the market,"" said Gaurav Vangaal, associate director at S&P Global Mobility. And like other automakers, Tata is struggling to source semiconductors amid a global shortage that has become its biggest challenge in ramping up production and has caused a 5 month backlog in EV orders. That said, Tata intends to make the most of its enviable lead in India's EV market. It has accrued a trove of data from monitoring the 25,000 EVs it has on the road - particularly relevant for developing electric cars in hot climates, says Kulkarni. ""India has several hotspots which make it a challenge for electrification. Developing EVs in this market provides us with rich data, information which can flow back into our development process. I can't tell you the kind of head start this gives us,"" he said.

5/2/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar held near a 20-year high on Monday as the euro struggled around the $1.05 mark, as investors prepared for a busy week of central bank meetings including a likely Federal Reserve interest rate hike. Markets in Asia and London were closed for public holidays so trading was quiet. Investors are expecting the Fed to hike rates by 50 basis points when it meets, and the uncertainty is around how hawkish Fed Chair Jerome Powell will sound in comments following the decision. Markets are pricing in an aggressive run of rate hikes from the Fed as it tries to tame soaring inflation. That, together with an expected much slower rate of European Central Bank tightening and worries about the impact of the war in Ukraine on the euro zone economy have sent investors scrambling for dollars and left the euro at levels last seen in 2017. The dollar index gained 5% in April, its best monthly performance since January 2015. ""We expect the USD to stay strong versus the EUR, as a hawkish FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] stance and geopolitical concerns will support the USD. Short-term investors may look to sell rallies in EURUSD above $1.08,"" Thomas Flury, strategist, and Brian Rose, senior U.S. economist at UBS Global Wealth Management wrote in a research note. They have lowered their euro/dollar forecasts to $1.05 for June from a previous $1.11, $1.06 for September, $1.08 for December and $1.10 for March 2023. The dollar index was last 103.19, down marginally on the day. The euro traded up 0.1% at $1.0555. BNP Paribas said last week that big speculative flows and not concerns about a worsening economic outlook explained the euro's slide to a five-year low below $1.05 this week. Elsewhere, the dollar gained half a percent on the Chinese yuan in offshore markets, reaching 6.6895 and just below its strongest since late 2020. Sterling slipped 0.1% to $1.2569, while Japan's yen was down against the dollar at 130.16 but off recent lows. Other central bank meetings this week include the Bank of England on Thursday, where it is expected to raise rates 25 basis points to 1%. The Australian and New Zealand dollars initially fell sharply in Asian hours as a selloff on Wall Street undermined risk appetite and overshadowed the prospect of higher interest rates at home. But by 0715 GMT the Aussie had bounced off three month lows and was last at $0.7060, unchanged on the day. The Australian dollar shed 5.7% last month as fears of a recession in Europe and lockdowns in China undermined risk assets. The kiwi dollar was pinned at its lowest since mid-2020 at $0.6422, having lost 6.9% in April.

U.S. futures rose after April’s slump, among the worst since the pandemic roiled markets in 2020. Treasuries were little changed after tumbling on Friday and a dollar gauge held around the highest level since 2020 as investors prepare for a week that’s likely to see a global round of monetary-policy tightening. The offshore yuan weakened in the wake of data signaling a sharp contraction in Chinese economic activity amid idled factories and snarled supply chains. Japan’s yen was also on the back foot against the greenback. Among individuals moves in Europe, Adler Group SA shares plunged after KPMG said it was unable to give an audit opinion and Vestas Wind Systems A/S slumped after forecasting its first loss in a decade.

Activision Blizzard Inc. climbed after Warren Buffett snapped up more of the stock in a merger arbitrage bet. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday, the largest increase since 2000. The question is how high it needs to go to get runaway inflation under control -- and whether the aggressive tightening cycle that lies ahead will trigger a recession. Bond yields may stay “elevated for the foreseeable future” due to inflation and the Fed’s sharp rate hikes allied with balance-sheet reduction, Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in a note. Price pressures are being stoked by the elevated cost of commodities ranging from fuel to food, in part due to disruptions from Russia’s war in Ukraine. Russia Tension Those challenges could intensify: the European Union is set to propose a ban on Russian oil by the end of the year, with restrictions on imports introduced gradually until then, according to people familiar with the matter.

5/2/2022,"Warren Buffett announced on Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) now owns a whopping 9.5% of video game giant Activision Blizzard (ATVI). The announcement, which the CEO made during Berkshire’s annual shareholders meeting, means that if Microsoft’s (MSFT) pending purchase of Activision Blizzard receives regulatory approval, the conglomerate should see a sizable return. “We now own 9.5%, something like, 9.5% of Activision,” Buffett said. “It is my purchases, not the manager, who bought it some months ago. And if the deal goes through we make some money, and if the deal doesn't go through who knows what happens.” The stake, which is worth some $6 billion, is a large increase from the $1 billion Berkshire Hathaway purchased before Microsoft announced it is buying Activision Blizzard. Buffett said his decision came down to the fact that Microsoft’s purchase values Activision Blizzard at $95 per share. Activision Blizzard was trading at $75.60 per share as of the close of markets on Friday. Berkshire initially took a stake in Activision Blizzard prior to Microsoft’s decision to purchase the firm on Jan. 18 for $68.7 billion. According to Buffett, one of Berkshire’s managers chose to make the deal at the time. After Microsoft announced the deal, however, Buffett said that he decided to purchase additional shares of his own volition. The 91-year-old CEO also wanted the audience to know that he hasn’t spoken to anyone at Microsoft and doesn’t know what the Justice Department or European Union will do as far as approving the purchase. Microsoft moved to purchase Activision Blizzard following a slew of controversies at the video game publisher including allegations that the company fostered a frat-like atmosphere rife with sexual harassment and discrimination against women. In March, Activision Blizzard agreed to pay $18 million to settle a suit related to the allegations filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. More recently, The Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and her then-boyfriend Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick were accused of previously using Facebook’s public relations team in 2016 and 2019 to quash a story about a protection order Kotick’s ex-girlfriend filed against him in 2014.

5/2/2022,"Although electric vehicles (EVs) may appear to be the last thing the oil and gas industry would desire, energy firms are investing heavily in EV technologies, not wanting to miss out on new energy transition opportunities. The likes of Shell, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, Equinor, and BP are all backing EV projects as they expand their portfolios to include non-traditional energy sectors. In 2021, several international oil majors acquired EV-related companies and technologies while, at the same time, several car manufacturers announced plans for the rollout of new EV models and an eventual transition away from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. The global electric car market is predicted to be worth over $354 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 19%. And with the number of electric passenger vehicles increasing by an anticipated 60 million by 2026, it’s no wonder that energy companies are investing in the future of transport. In Europe, Shell has been just one of the oil majors to expand its EV charging network over the last year. Shell’s subsidiary, ubitricity – standing for ubiquitous electricity – is using innovative technologies to enhance access to EV charging stations by powering cars across cities through lamp posts. Shell’s public charging network, Shell Recharge, expects to have over 500,000 charging points globally by 2025, establishing locations across supermarkets, street-charging points, and EV hubs. Shell is also leading by example by establishing an EV charging hub in London, replacing its petrol and diesel pumps with ultra-rapid 175kW charge points, which provide cars with around an 80 percent charge in 30 minutes. This is a global pilot for the energy firm, and the site in Fulham is constructed out of sustainable materials showing how the future of car fuelling could look. TotalEnergies has established a similar goal, to create 150,000 EV charge points across Europe by 2025. The oil major already has around 22,000 charge points in Greater Amsterdam, 3,000 in Antwerp, 1,700 in London, 2,300 in Paris, 1,500 in Singapore, and 11,000 in Wuhan. And in November 2021, it allocated over $210 million to fit around 150 of its motorway and expressway service stations with high-power charge points for electric vehicles across France. In the U.S., ExxonMobil is gradually developing products to support the growing EV network. The firm launched its range of MovilEV fluids and greases aimed at allowing EVs to travel further between charges, extending equipment component life, and promoting safer operation. As well as EVs, Exxon is looking at the potential for low-carbon fuels for driving the future of transport. In April, Porsche announced a $75 million investment deal with HIF Global and partners, including Siemens Energy and ExxonMobil, for the development of eFuels – synthetic low-carbon fuels it aims to use across several of its vehicles. Exxon is supporting Porsche’s aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 by investing in the car manufacturer’s use of hydrogen and carbon dioxide, using wind energy to develop its efuels. Related: EU In Talks With Alternative Suppliers As It Considers A Russian Oil Ban Other energy majors are taking a different approach to the EV market by investing in raw materials for battery production. In November, Equinor announced its investment in Lithium de France for the development of batteries. Lithium de France joins net-zero carbon geothermal energy output with the extraction of lithium from hot brines located deep in the subsurface of the earth to provide the raw material required for the production of lithium batteries. Last year, Equinor also announced a $130-million investment in Solid Power, a U.S. firm developing all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) for electric vehicles. The BMW Group and Ford have also partnered with Solid Power to acquire ASSBs for their new EV models. Equinor believes the development of ASSBs could provide lower-cost EV batteries to the market. But it’s BP that’s ahead of the pack when it comes to EVs, announcing a $1-billion investment in UK EV charging infrastructure this March. The investment will be rolled out over 10 years to triple its charging points by 2030. BP pulse, the company’s EV charging business, expects to add hundreds of new jobs to the market, as well as support the acceleration of the U.K.’s EV market through the development of rapid and ultra-fast chargers in key locations. This April, BP sent EV stock soaring with the announcement of a multi-year contract with Tritium. Tritium will provide almost 1,000 chargers for the U.K., Australian, and New Zealand markets. Upon the announcement, the Nasdaq-listed company shares rose by over 12 percent. BP’s investment plan goes hand-in-hand with the U.K. government’s EV infrastructure strategy, which aims for a minimum of 300,000 public charge points by 2030. Despite many of the world’s energy majors continuing to pump huge amounts of money into oil and gas operations, they also recognize the inevitability of an energy transition over the next decades. Several international players are now investing in the future of energy and transportation, making sure they diversify their portfolios to remain relevant in the years to come.

5/2/2022,"So far, 2022 has hit Amazon where it hurts — in the wallet. During the first three months of the year, the e-tailer suffered a $3.8 billion net loss, shocking analysts and Wall Street. It was the company’s first quarterly loss in seven years and, it turns out, Amazon itself may be partly responsible. After reporting $116.4 billion in revenue, which limped over estimates of $116.3 billion and even showed a little growth, at 7 percent over the same time last year, analysts were left stunned by the financial stumble. More from WWD The Fashion in 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' Season Four 2020 Holiday Gift Ideas: Google's Top Searched Beauty, Home and Tech Gifts Amazon Prime Day 2020: Fashion and Beauty Deals to Check Out Amazon blamed the tanking value of its major investment in Rivian Automotive, a once-buzzworthy EV (electric vehicle) company whose initial public offering in November was hailed as the most successful IPO in several years. Rivian basked in the glow of its key investor and, thanks to a partnership deal, could boast that it was supplying EV delivery vans to one of the world’s top e-commerce platforms. But in recent months, its stock has been tanking, leaving investors agape as three-quarters of Rivian’s share value evaporated. For Amazon, which soaked a total of $1.8 billion into the start-up, the free fall resulted in a whopping $7.6 billion loss. The reasons for the downturn range from self-inflicted — like a big price hike that triggered backlash from preorder customers — to other complications, including component shortages. But Amazon’s own actions didn’t help. It’s supposed to receive 100,000 Rivian-made electric delivery vehicles, but confusion reigns, as it’s not clear when they’re coming and how many have been produced so far. What investors do know, however, is that Amazon isn’t relying on that: Early this year, revelations surfaced that the company has been striking e-car deals with Stellantis, Daimler and others, shaking confidence in the start-up. It makes for a fascinating twist. Rivian’s marquee investor wound up undermining the business. Now its falling share value — fueled by that and other woes — came back to bite Amazon. Not that it’s alone. Ford Motor Company invested in the EV company as well, resulting in $5.4 billion in loss. But optimism over its strategic plans, and the fact that it beat revenue and earnings estimates, gave Ford some resilience. That’s not the case for Amazon right now. The last quarter looks particularly bad compared to last year. In the first quarter of 2021, pandemic-fueled online shopping and gains across other business units drove 44 percent year-over-year growth and $108.5 billion in revenue, with profits north of $8 billion. First-quarter 2022 projections essentially cut that in half, laying out expectations of $4.4 billion in profit that were ultimately unfulfilled. According to Amazon, the second quarter doesn’t look much better. It forecasts slowing year-over-year growth between 3 and 7 percent, pegging revenue between $116 billion and $121 billion. Analysts thought it would come to $125.5 billion. Shares fell 10 percent in after-hours trading, and as of Friday, they still haven’t recovered. At least it has the Prime Day annual sales extravaganza to look forward to in July. According to chief executive officer Andy Jassy: “The pandemic and subsequent war in Ukraine have brought unusual growth and challenges” — which paints Amazon as subject to the same broader challenges that have been plaguing the retail and technology sectors across the board. While that’s true, it’s clearly not the full picture. Still, he tried to focus on the bright spots during the quarter, like Amazon Web Services, which has become a rather foundational part of the company. The cloud division outperformed Amazon as a whole, with $18.44 billion in sales blowing past the $18.27 billion expected and operating income soaring 57 percent to $6.5 billion. Jassy also painted a positive portrait of its consumer business, with high growth over the past two years prompting the company to double its fulfillment network. With that behind it, now it’s focusing on efficiencies like delivery speed. Performance has been improving, he said, even “approaching levels not seen since the months immediately preceding the pandemic in early 2020.” It’s not clear if Rivian’s electric delivery vehicles are supposed to be part of that plan, and if so, when. The new Buy With Prime program could also be a pressure test on Amazon’s infrastructure, as offering fast shipping and other Prime perks to outside e-commerce sites looks like a major expansion. Notably, in only the second time Amazon broke out figures for its ad business, it apparently eked out a small victory — which is conspicuous in a tough quarter for tech, in general. Ad sales of $7.88 billion may not have met expectations of $8.17 billion, but they still represent a 23 percent uptick over last year. That’s good enough to edge out Google (22 percent) and trounce Facebook (6.1 percent). Of course, as a retailer, Amazon faces challenges that go beyond tech sector concerns, like warehouse labor issues. Just weeks ago, workers in Staten Island, New York, voted in favor of forming a labor union, setting up a historic first for the company — the arrival of its first official unionized workplace in the U.S. Now other warehouses are trying to unionize as well.

5/2/2022,"Apple's value chain in China, an emblem of the country's global role as a source of labour and assembly, has been hit hard by strict lockdowns in Shanghai and neighbouring provinces, raising the risk that the US tech giant may accelerate a shift of its operations away from China, say analysts. While it is hard to put an exact figure on the losses resulting from the disruption to transport and production along Apple's extensive value chain in China, chief financial officer Luca Maestri told a conference call on Thursday that Covid-19-related lockdowns and a chip shortage would reduce the company's revenue by up to US$8 billion in the June quarter. Maestri said this was ""substantially larger than"" the impact in the previous quarter and also warned about the likely knock-on effect of reduced consumer demand in China due to lockdowns.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Apple's close links with China have, historically, been underpinned by two main factors. First, the country is an ideal assembly centre for the California-based tech giant, thanks to its advanced infrastructure, skilled labour force and efficient logistics services. Components from Taiwan, South Korea and elsewhere are assembled into iPhones and iPads on factory floors in China for the whole world to buy. Secondly, China itself is the second-largest market for Apple, thanks to the country's growing middle class, which has become increasingly affluent over the past decade, say analysts. But this positive alignment of factors is now under threat. China's strict lockdowns in Shanghai and Jiangsu province - key financial and manufacturing centres - since the end of March to tame the highly-infectious Omicron variant of Covid-19, have raised doubts about the country's position as an integral part of global supply chains for Apple. The situation has become more acute for China given that other countries - particularly Vietnam and India, which are returning to normal after Covid-related disruption - are eyeing a bigger share of Apple's value chain. Apple CEO Tim Cook has maintained smooth relations with Beijing. Photo: EPA-EFE alt=Apple CEO Tim Cook has maintained smooth relations with Beijing. Photo: EPA-EFE> According to calculations by the South China Morning Post, more than half of Apple's 192 suppliers with an internal manufacturing site for the company, including Foxconn, Pegatron, Quanta, Wistron and Compal, have production facilities in lockdown-hit Shanghai and Jiangsu. Moreover, two Foxconn factories in Shenzhen had to suspend operations for days in March amid a local brief lockdown, while the largest iPhone assembly compound in Zhengzhou has been short of labour as Covid-19 restrictions have made it hard for migrant workers from other areas to reach the Foxconn factory there. For lesser-known suppliers or subcontractors in Apple's value chain, it has been even harder to maintain normal levels of operation. Foxconn had to suspend operations at two plants in Kunshan last week after one worker in its closed-loop was found to be infected with Covid-19. Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at TF Securities who follows Apple, said lockdowns in the Yangtze River Delta region would roughly lead to a 30 to 40 per cent drop in shipments this quarter for Apple, although the shortfall could be narrowed to 15 to 25 per cent if other suppliers step in. Delivery times for Apple MacBook Pros have been delayed by up to five weeks as the sole assembler, Quanta, has been forced to suspend operations due to the Shanghai lockdown, said Kuo. Apple had already started to consider reducing its reliance on China but the recent lockdowns have accelerated the process, said Kuo. Relocating some production facilities from China is ""no longer a proposal but an action plan"", added Kuo. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its plans for China in the face of lockdown-related disruption. The Covid-19 lockdowns come at a time when geopolitical pressure is rising for an economic decoupling between China and the United States. Former US President Donald Trump pushed for the reshoring of US manufacturing and the Biden administration has been working with regional allies to reduce supply chain reliance on China. Two of the four campuses of Foxconn in Kunshan, located on the north of the city, went into strict lockdown on April 20 after the Apple supplier reported confirmed Covid cases. Photo: SCMP/Ann Cao alt=Two of the four campuses of Foxconn in Kunshan, located on the north of the city, went into strict lockdown on April 20 after the Apple supplier reported confirmed Covid cases. Photo: SCMP/Ann Cao> Apple, under chief executive Tim Cook, has maintained a smooth relationship with Beijing despite some sporadic consumer boycotts of Apple products in China. Cook heads up the advisory committee for the economic management school at Tsinghua University, which gives him access to China's national leaders. Tech media outlet The Information reported at the end of last year that Cook signed an agreement with Chinese officials, estimated to be worth about US$275 billion, to help China develop its technological prowess and to head off state action which would have hobbled Apple's devices and services in the country. In Thursday's conference call, Cook said Apple was likely to move more production capacity back to the US considering the ongoing challenges. ""Our supply chain is truly global ... we do a lot in the US and we'll probably be doing even more here as more chips are produced here,"" he said, without giving more details. Other options for Apple could include India, where land and labour are much cheaper than in the United States. With roads and ports clogged in China due to lockdown, iPhone production in India surged by 50 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022. This was aided by a decision to assemble the iPhone 13 in a Foxconn factory near Chennai, according to Indian media reports. And China remains critically important for Apple as a consumer market. ""China growth remains the fuel in the engine [for Apple],"" Dan Ives and John Katsingris, analysts at New York-based Wedbush, wrote in a recent research report. But the analysts added that supply chain issues have already cut the sale of around 15 million units of iPhones over the past few quarters. Meanwhile, there is little sign that China is about to give up on its ""dynamic zero"" policy approach to Covid-19. For those industrial enterprises allowed to resume production, strict quarantine rules remain in place, which could translate into additional costs, reduced efficiency and fresh uncertainties down the line. ""The best case [for full resumption] is June,"" said Kuo.

5/2/2022,"By Danilo Masoni MILAN (Reuters) - Shares fell and the dollar held near highs in holiday-thinned trading on Monday, as concerns about economic growth lingered ahead of an expected U.S. rate hike this week and after data showed COVID-19 lockdowns slowed China's factory activity. MSCI's benchmark for global stocks was down by 0.3% by 0811 GMT, as European and Asian shares fell ahead of the Federal Reserve decision and following Wall Street's steep losses on Friday in the wake of a disappointing Amazon update. Data that signalled a steeper pace of contraction in China's factory activity also dampened risk appetite, although the closure of London and most Asian markets for a holiday reduced volumes. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1.2%, on course to snap a three-day winning streak. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.1% and South Korea's KOSPI declined 0.3%. Factory activity in China contracted at a steeper pace in April as widespread COVID-19 lockdowns halted industrial production and disrupted supply chains in the world's second largest economy. A survey on Monday also showed that euro zone manufacturing output growth stalled in April as factories struggled to source raw materials while demand took a knock from steep price increases and concerns about the economic outlook. That raised fears of a sharp slowdown in the second quarter that will weigh on global growth, just as central banks around the world start to tighten policy aggressively to combat inflation pressures, exacerbated this year by the war in Ukraine. Investors expect the Fed to raise rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday, although there was uncertainty around how hawkish Chair Jerome Powell will sound in comments following the decision. ""A 50bp hike in the fed fund target rate and the announcement of the beginning of quantitative tightening seems to be a done deal,"" UniCredit economists led by Tullia Bucco said. ""Still, market participants are uncertain as to whether this big leap forward in the Fed's policy-tightening process will be accompanied by dovish, neutral or hawkish statements from Powell,"" they added in a note. Around 250 basis points of rate hikes are already priced in by money markets by the end of this year, which UniCredit says reduces the scope for hawkish surprises this week. On Friday, Wall Street suffered its worst drop since 2020, as Amazon slumped on a gloomy quarterly report, and as the biggest surge in monthly inflation since 2005 spooked investors already worried about rising interest rates. U.S. equity futures bounced back on Monday, sending Nasdaq and S&P 500 e-minis up between 0.8% and 0.6%. U.S. treasury yields nudged up in European morning trade, staying a little below of their peaks hit last week. The benchmark 10-year yield added 0.4 basis points to 2.941%, having reached as high as 2.981% on April 20. The dollar edged back towards its nearly two-decade high and the euro slipped down to $1.05, as investors prepared for the likely Fed rate hike. The dollar index was last at 103.32, little changed on the day. The euro traded down 0.1% at $1.0536. Oil prices fell as concerns about weak economic growth in COVID-19 hit China lingered, offsetting risks of supply stress from a potential European ban on Russian crude. The European Union is leaning toward a ban on imports of Russian oil by the end of the year, two EU diplomats said, after talks between the European Commission and EU member states this weekend. Brent crude fell 0.9% to $106 per barrel, and U.S. crude lost 1% to $103.69. Gold prices fell as elevated U.S. yields pressured demand for zero-yield bullion.

5/2/2022,"By Jonathan Stempel OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc dove into equity markets in the first quarter, spending more than $51 billion on stocks including a much larger stake in Chevron Corp. Berkshire, which Buffett has run since 1965, also said on Saturday quarterly operating profit was little changed from a year earlier, with some businesses able to fend off supply chain disruptions. Geico, the car insurer, posted an underwriting loss. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company also said it repurchased $3.2 billion of its own stock in the quarter, but none in the first three weeks of April. Berkshire's disclosures suggest that Buffett has finally found large new uses to dispose of Berkshire's cash pile, which shrank more than $40 billion to about $106 billion. The Chevron stake grew to $25.9 billion as of March 31 from just $4.5 billion three months earlier, as oil prices surged higher following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That came on the heels of Berkshire's purchase of well over $6 billion of stock in Occidental Petroleum Corp, where it already had a $10 billion preferred stock stake. Buffett has also committed $11.6 billion to buy insurance company Alleghany Corp, and bought $4.2 billion of HP Inc stock. Berkshire ended March with $391 billion of stocks, more than half of the company's $712 billion overall market value. Other businesses include the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and a variety of manufacturing and retail operations including See's Candies and Dairy Queen ice cream. NET RESULTS FALL First-quarter operating profit edged up to $7.04 billion, or about $4,786 per Class A share, from $7.02 billion a year earlier. Berkshire's net income fell 53% to $5.46 billion, or $3,702 per Class A share, to $11.71 billion, or $7,638 per Class A share, a year earlier. Net results included $1.58 billion of gains and losses from stocks including Apple Inc, as well as Chevron. An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized gains and losses with net results, and Buffett urges investors to ignore the resulting volatility. Berkshire released results ahead of its first in-person annual shareholder meeting since 2019 in Omaha. DISRUPTIONS In its quarterly report, Berkshire alluded to the Ukraine invasion, without mentioning it specifically, and the spread of Omicron variants of COVID-19 in discussing the supply chain issues that many businesses now face. ""Significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs have persisted in 2022,"" it said. ""Further, the development of geopolitical conflicts in 2022 have contributed to disruptions of supply chains, resulting in cost increases for commodities, goods, and services in many parts of the world."" Berkshire businesses that took hits included Precision Castparts aircraft parts, Clayton Homes mobile homes and McLane food distribution. Chip shortages were also a problem, dampening consumer shipping volume at BNSF and reducing sales volume at Berkshire Hathaway Automotive car dealerships. Revenue nevertheless rose at both, with BNSF benefiting from higher fuel prices and surcharges, and car and truck sales revenue growing because vehicles are getting more expensive. Rising used car prices and shortages of replacement parts also weighed on the Geico auto insurer, which posted an underwriting loss because loss claims are increasing.
