4/5/2022,"Hacker collective Anonymous announced on Twitter that it successfully breached and leaked the personal data of 120,000 Russian soldiers. https://twitter.com/YourAnonNews/status/1510494900713840641 ""All soldiers participating in the invasion of Ukraine should be subjected to a war crime tribunal,"" Anonymous said in the message. The leak included personal information like dates of birth, addresses, passport numbers, and unit affiliation. Anonymous also tweeted that it would take a while for society to forgive Russia for the atrocities in Ukraine spurred by Putin's invasion. https://twitter.com/YourAnonNews/status/1510480218632380423 While Anonymous announced the leak on Sunday, it occurred in early March and first appeared on Pravda, a Ukrainian news outlet, days after the invasion began. The outlet did not disclose the source of the leak but stated the ""Center for Defense Strategies acquired this data from reliable sources,"" according to Newsweek. This week, the Russian military has been facing even more scrutiny after concern was raised over alleged human rights abuses in Bucha. Reports suggested civilians were being abused and killed, and some say corpses have been found in yards, streets, and cars. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Anonymous has been very outspoken about the war. ""The hacking will continue until Russia stops their aggression,"" Anonymous said. Among its efforts to fight back, the collective has claimed it has disabled government, corporate, and news websites, hacked into a top censorship agency, and hacked into Russian TVs. Other recent efforts include hacking into unsecured printers in Russia to spread anti-Kremlin propaganda. In an interview with IBT, one of the collective members said they were instructing Russians on how to install open-source software to allow citizens to bypass the country's censorship, according to Raw Story.

Sullivan said the Biden administration would announce fresh military assistance for Ukraine in the coming days and stressed that further sanctions against Russian energy are also on the table in talks with European allies. Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion in Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24, is Europe's bloodiest since World War Two. Russia calls it a ""special military operation"" aimed at protecting civilians. Sullivan warned the next phase may be protracted with Russian troops outnumbering Ukraine's.

4/5/2022,"The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-11 on Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court nomination. The move forces Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to invoke special procedures to advance Jackson's nomination. The so-called discharge vote is expected to happen on Monday afternoon. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on Monday moved one step closer to becoming the first ever Black woman on the Supreme Court, even though the Senate Judiciary Committee deadlocked on her nomination. The panel split 11-11 on Jackson's nomination, with all Democrats in support and all Republicans against. The deadlock forced Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to invoke special procedures to advance Jackson's nomination. The top Democrat filed what's called a ""motion to discharge"" the committee from Jackson's nomination. That discharge vote only requires a simple majority, and given the Senate's 50-50 split with Democrats in control, they will be able to push Jackson's nomination forward. After that vote on Monday evening, Jackson remains on track for a final confirmation vote before the full Senate, which will likely take place later this week. Still, the tied vote represents how partisan the Supreme Court confirmation process has become in recent years. The committee was widely anticipated to deadlock after several Republicans on the panel announced their opposition to Jackson. Those GOP members, including Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Ted Cruz of Texas, and Josh Hawley of Missouri, aggressively questioned Jackson during her confirmation hearings last month, appearing likely to vote against her. Yet GOP opposition will not tank Jackson's nomination. The 51-year-old judge is expected to be confirmed with full Democratic support and the backing of at least one Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who revealed last week that she plans to vote for Jackson. Senate Democrats and the White House have been vying to peel off some GOP votes for a bipartisan confirmation. Last year, Collins supported Jackson's confirmation to her current seat on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, as did two other Republicans: Graham and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. This time around, Graham opposed Jackson's nomination because of what he described as her record of ""judicial activism"" and a ""lack of a steady judicial philosophy."" Murkowski has not yet announced how she will vote, but Monday's discharge vote could preview how she intends to. Most Republicans have already said they will vote against Jackson. Though another possible swing vote for Jackson is Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who has not yet announced which way he will go. Monday's committee vote comes after Jackson met individually with senators for weeks and faced roughly 22 hours of questioning during her confirmation hearings, which at times grew contentious. Republicans grilled Jackson on her sentencing record and her judicial philosophy, while Democrats touted her extensive legal experience, her endorsements from both sides of the political aisle, and her history-making moment as the first Black woman nominated for the nation's highest court. Jackson expressed gratitude for the nomination and pledged that if confirmed, she will ""support and defend the Constitution and this grand experiment of American democracy that has endured over these past 246 years."" ""I decide cases from a neutral posture. I evaluate the facts. And I interpret and apply the law to the facts of the case before me without fear or favor consistent with my judicial oath,"" Jackson said in her opening statement.

4/5/2022,"A satellite image analysis conducted by The New York Times appears to disprove Moscow's claims that the massacre in Bucha, Ukraine happened after Russian soldiers had left the town around March 30. Since gruesome images out of Bucha emerged over the weekend, the Russian Ministry of Defense has denied responsibility for any of the killings and decried the reports as a ""hoax."" On Sunday, the ministry even suggested the bodies were placed on the street after Russian troops withdrew, the Times writes. However, a Times' review of video and satellite images shows ""many of the civilians were killed more than three weeks ago, when Russia's military was in control of the town."" For example, when cross-referenced with a video filmed April 2, satellite images provided to the Times showed that at least 11 bodies seen in the April 2 video had been on the street since March 11, ""when Russia, by its own account, occupied the town,"" the Times writes. More specifically, the images show human body-sized objects on Yablonska Street in Bucha between March 9 and March 11. The objects ""appear in the precise positions in which the bodies were found after Ukrainian forces reclaimed Bucha, as the footage from April 2 shows,"" the Times adds. Further examination reveals the objects were in those positions for more than three weeks. The situation out of Bucha has so far sparked international condemnation and promises of more sanctions on Russia. Germany and France on Monday expelled numerous Russian diplomats, while President Biden called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be tried for war crimes. 7 brutally funny cartoons about Will Smith's Oscars slap Russia threatens to end cooperation at International Space Station unless 'illegal sanctions' are lifted Secret Service is renting $30,000-a-month Malibu mansion to protect Hunter Biden, ABC News reports",World/The Week,Satellite images show bodies in Bucha while Russia still occupied town,https://news.yahoo.com/satellite-images-show-bodies-bucha-212525687.html
4/5/2022,"This story contains graphic descriptions and images. Ukrainian law enforcement officers have discovered a torture room in Bucha, just outside Kyiv, according to Ukraine’s Prosecutor General’s Office. Russian forces have tortured and killed civilians inside the torture room, the office claimed. “Soldiers of the Russian Federation armed forces tortured unarmed civilians and then killed them,” the Prosecutor General’s Office said in a Facebook post about the alleged torture room. ‘Worse Than Animals’: Emotional Zelensky Views Carnage in Ukraine Town The Prosecutor General's Office shared photos it says depict several Ukrainians that were killed in the room. The Daily Beast has not independently verified the photos, although Reuters provided photos of the men allegedly killed in the room. The discovery is the latest in a series of horrific disclosures about alleged Russian atrocities in Ukraine since the war began in February. Just this weekend Ukrainian authorities and journalists uncovered mass graves with Ukrainians shot dead, allegedly by Russian forces, in Bucha. Images of dead naked women, some of them burned, have also emerged from Bucha in the last several days. Ukrainians have also had their hands bound behind their backs, and been shot dead in the streets, images taken in the city show. And although Russia has denied the allegations that it has been behind the string of disturbing killings, suggesting that they happened after Russia began to withdraw from the region, satellite imagery shared with The Daily Beast and first reported by The New York Times reveals Russia is lying through its teeth. Many of the dead bodies in question were on the streets of Bucha approximately 20 days before Russia withdrew. Satellite imagery from private company Maxar Technologies shared with The Daily Beast Sunday appears to show a 45-foot-long trench dug in Bucha as well—the excavation of which began March 10, well in advance of Russian troops’ withdrawal, Maxar said. President Joe Biden labeled Russian President Vladimir Putin a “war criminal” Monday and said that Putin should be tried for war crimes as the disturbing images emerged from Bucha and other cities in Ukraine. Putin’s Minions Demand Grotesque ‘Rewards’ for Mass Killers in Ukraine Already, the International Criminal Court, along with a Ukrainian investigation, is probing alleged war crimes in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the killings a ""genocide,"" while the Biden administration stopped short of using the label. But Biden’s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday that label still hasn’t been ruled out. Sullivan suggested that Ukrainians and the rest of the world should be prepared for more heartless attacks and grim images to emerge from Ukraine, even as Russia works to change its ground game to focus more on eastern regions of the country. “We should be under no illusions that Russia will adjust its tactics, which have included and will likely continue to include… brazen attacks on civilian targets,” Sullivan said in a briefing Monday, warning that although Moscow is retreating from Kyiv, Russia forces will likely continue to launch air and missile strikes in Ukraine. The images of the atrocities in Ukraine have rallied world leaders to step up the sanctions against Russia—the European Union is working on a new sanctions package rollout, and the Biden administration is preparing to announce new sanctions against Russia later this week, according to the White House.
