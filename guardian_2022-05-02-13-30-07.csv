5/2/2022,"The Arkansas governor, Asa Hutchinson, is considering a run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 and would not be deterred if Donald Trump made an expected bid to return to the White House. “No, it won’t [deter me],” Hutchinson told CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday. “I’ve made it clear. I think we ought to have a different direction in the future and so I’m not aligned with [Trump] on some of his endorsements, but also the direction he wants to take our country. “I think he did a lot of good things for our country, but we need to go a different direction and so that’s not a factor in my decision-making process.” Trump is free to run – and has amassed huge campaign funding – after being acquitted in his second Senate impeachment trial, in which he was charged with inciting the deadly January 6 Capitol attack, in his attempt to overturn defeat by Joe Biden. More than 20 years ago, Hutchinson was a House impeachment manager in the trial of Bill Clinton, over the 42nd president’s affair with Monica Lewinsky. As Arkansas governor, Hutchinson now operates in the more moderate lane of Republican politics. On CNN, he was asked about an appearance last week at a “Politics & Eggs” event in New Hampshire, a “traditional stop for any presidential hopeful” in an early voting state. “You’ve got to get through course this year,” he said, “but that’s an option that’s on the table. And that’s one of the reasons I was in New Hampshire.” Hutchinson used his CNN interview to take a shot at Ron DeSantis, another potential candidate in 2024, regarding the Florida governor’s battle with Disney over his anti-LGBTQ+ schools policy. The Arkansas governor was also asked if he would support Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader and an ardent Trump ally, to become speaker if Republicans take control in November. He said: “Well, of course, you know, Speaker McCarthy, or excuse me, Majority Leader McCarthy has his own set of challenges within the caucus. And he’s got to be able to somehow bring that together.” McCarthy was recently shown to have said Trump should resign in the aftermath of the Capitol attack, to have changed his tune to support the former president, and to have lied about what he told his party. Hutchinson told CNN: “I would say that we had one message after January 6 among many of our leaders, recognising the problem with the insurrection. And that tone has changed and I believe that that’s an error. “I don’t think we can diminish what happened on January 6. We’re going to be having hearings there in Congress and much of this will come out in public in June, and that’s not going to be helpful for those that diminish the significance of that event. “And so that worries me in terms of not just the majority leader but also worries me in terms of other leaders that have diminished what happened on January 6.”",News/US news,Trump or no Trump: Asa Hutchinson mulls run for president in 2024,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/01/trump-asa-hutchinson-republican-presidential-nomination-2024
5/2/2022,"Elderly residents trapped at a nursing home near the frontline of war in eastern Ukraine are to be evacuated thanks to donations from a fundraiser held thousands of miles away in New Orleans in the US. Ukrainian-born Katya Chizayeva, who now lives in the Louisiana city, organised the event at a restaurant after reading in the Guardian about the plight of residents at the facility in Chasiv Yar, a Donbas village just kilometres away from the frontline. A total of $8,000 (£6,351) was raised for the nursing home. Without the means to leave, elderly people have borne the brunt of the fighting in the Donbas over the last eight years. The situation only worsened when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February. When the Guardian visited the nursing home in April, most of the residents interviewed had been made homeless by the shelling. The nursing home’s director, Ievhen Tkachov, said they are in the process of evacuating the last 12 people – a mixture of those who are bedridden and new residents they have received because of the fighting nearby. “The biggest chunk of the money will go towards making the accommodation suitable for the old people,” said Tkachov. Tkachov started searching for a place to move the residents when the war started. Having lived under the Russian-backed separatists, Tkachov said they had to leave. “I know there will be no water, no electricity, no heating, no medicine. This lot will become a mass grave in a matter of days,” said Tkachov, referring to his vulnerable residents. “We have to go.” Over a month ago he wrote a post on Facebook as he panicked about approaching Russian soldiers. Russian forces have not made much progress along the entrenched 2014-2022 eastern frontline where Chasiv Yar sits. But in the first weeks of the war, they captured swathes of territory to the north and east, encircling Ukrainian-controlled Donbas. A local church in the Khmelnytskyi region of western Ukraine contacted Tkachov. They asked the local authorities for help and a disused school was allocated for the elderly evacuees. Tkachov and his team are in the process of renovating it. So far, they have evacuated more than 30 people to the school. “We are going to buy a boiler to make it warmer,” said Tkachov, explaining how the money would be spent. “At the moment it’s suitable for a student who comes in for half a day and then goes home but our people will be there full-time.”“ “We want to buy some special beds, they cost around $500,” said Tkachov. Tkachov said the donation had made a big difference, though he lamented the exchange rates. “There’s another nuance,” he said. “From the $8,000, we only received $7,200 thanks to the [Ukrainian]) state currency exchange system.”",News/World news,Donbas nursing home residents evacuated after New Orleans fundraiser,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/02/donbas-nursing-home-residents-evacuated-after-new-orleans-fundraiser
5/2/2022,"Those most at risk of dying with Covid are being prevented from accessing potentially life-saving treatments, Australia’s peak body for GPs said. Deaths from Covid-19 in Australia remain consistently high, with Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria reporting more than 40 Covid-19 deaths between them on Sunday. Along with the unvaccinated, people with underlying health conditions or who are immunosuppressed are overrepresented in the Covid-19 deaths data. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president, Adj Professor Karen Price, said she was concerned about a lack of awareness about drugs now available that can be taken by those most at risk of developing severe disease and potentially dying. These treatments, if taken early after symptom onset, can prevent Covid from developing into severe disease. “There are a number of barriers in people accessing these medicines, the main being that the time from symptom onset to taking the first tablet must be five days or less,” Price told Guardian Australia. “Which is not a lot, given the person needs to identify their symptoms, get tested, notify or have their GP be notified of their positive status, have their eligibility for these medicines be determined and then get their script filled at their local pharmacy.” Price said there needs to be more public awareness of the medicines and who is eligible so that people know that if they test positive, they should contact their GP as soon as possible. “Early notification is critical to ensure patients receive the care they need, including access to antivirals,” she said. There are now a range of treatment options to manage different stages of Covid-19 disease. From Monday, Paxlovid was made available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for certain high-risk patients with mild-to-moderate Covid-19. The oral antiviral treatment is taken twice-daily for five days and should be taken within five days of symptoms appearing. Lagevrio is another antiviral shown to reduce the risk of severe infection and hospitalisation. Four capsules are taken every 12 hours for five days, and it is most effective when taken as soon as possible after symptoms show. There are also treatments like sotrovimab that need to be given through intravenous infusion by a nurse at a healthcare facility. Like the oral treatments, intravenous treatments are most effective when given within the first five days after symptom onset. A Therapeutic Goods Administration spokeswoman said supplies are available in the National Medical Stockpile. Doses of Paxlovid and Lagevrio have been predeployed to residential aged care facilities, Aboriginal-controlled community health organisations and the Royal Flying Doctor Service, she said. In Victoria, the Monash Satellite Clinic is one of the facilities providing early treatments for Covid-positive patients. A spokesman did not directly answer questions about whether there is concern some people may be dying as they are not aware of or not getting early access to the drugs. “Our Covid Pathways program, delivered by Monash Health, community providers and GPs, identifies medically at-risk patients to ensure the best possible treatment and care is made available as soon as possible,” a spokesman said. The president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Omar Khorshid, said Covid deaths data needs to be analysed to determine whether there were deaths that may have been prevented if given access to early treatments. “States and territory health departments do need to forensically look at what’s going on, and what lessons can be learned,” Khorshid said. “They need to look at every death and ask whether each person received early treatment, and if not, if they should have. It’s not reasonable to give every at-risk person treatment, as these drugs also carry side-effects and issues. But there are really important questions to ask about these deaths.”",News/Australia news,"People at greatest risk of Covid death being prevented from accessing life-saving antivirals, RACGP says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/02/people-at-greatest-risk-of-covid-death-being-prevented-from-accessing-life-saving-antivirals-racgp-says
