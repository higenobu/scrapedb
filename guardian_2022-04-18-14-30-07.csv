4/18/2022,"Nearly one in 10 parents are “very likely” to use a food bank to feed their children over the next three months, a survey has found. It means that as many as 1.3 million parents are expecting to have to visit a food bank as families struggle to cope with rising costs of living, with 88% of those surveyed admitting their monthly food bill has increased in the past three months alone. The Trussell Trust research, carried out with the food delivery company Deliveroo, also found that a third of parents skipped at least one meal to keep up with other costs, while 20% said they had been unable to cook hot food at least once in the past three months because of the cost of using an oven. Of those who said their household bills had gone up, 58% said they had cut back on heating as a result. Emma Revie, the chief executive of food bank charity, said: “Everyone should be able to afford their own food, but as families face the biggest income squeeze in a generation, people are telling us they’re having to make impossible decisions between heating and eating and being forced to turn to food banks to feed themselves.” She said the charity was about to enter a partnership with Deliveroo to provide up to 2 million meals and support for people facing hunger across the country. “Our new partnership with Deliveroo will help us support food banks to provide emergency food and in-food-bank support to thousands of people in immediate crisis while we work towards our long-term vision of a future where nobody needs to turn to charity to get by,” she said. Will Shu, Deliveroo’s chief executive, said: “I am pleased we are partnering with the Trussell Trust to support local food banks across the country. We’re committed to using our platform to play a positive role in the communities in which we operate. “Together with our consumers, our amazing restaurant and grocery partners and our network of riders, we want to play our part in helping to tackle food insecurity in the UK.” The archbishop of Canterbury spoke in his Easter Sunday sermon at Canterbury Cathedral of his concern for families struggling with rising energy and food prices. “Families across the country are waking up to cold homes and empty stomachs as we face the greatest cost-of-living crisis we have known in our lifetimes. And because of this they wake up with fear,” he said. Leading analysts warned last week that energy bills would stay well above £2,000 for two more years. Cornwall Insights, which approximately predicted the recent 54% rise in the cap on average energy bills to £1,971, said that prolonged high prices would threaten the chancellor’s loan scheme to help households cope with the soaring cost of gas.",News/Society,Almost one in 10 parents ‘very likely to use UK food bank in next three months’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/18/almost-one-in-10-parents-very-likely-to-use-uk-food-bank-in-next-three-months
4/18/2022,"More than 11,000 people who volunteered or worked with the UK Covid vaccination programme have decided to take up jobs within the NHS, health officials have revealed. As the Covid pandemic struck, researchers began work on vaccines to tackle the disease, with the first vaccination after emergency use authorisation given in the UK in December 2020. The jab marked the start of the largest mass vaccination programme in the history of the NHS, with tens of thousands of people taking up paid or volunteer roles to help. More than 92% of people aged 12 and over in the UK have received a first Covid jab to date, with almost 68% having had three doses. Now health officials have revealed that 11,483 volunteer vaccinators have decided to start a new career in the NHS, with some studying for clinical roles or others taking up jobs supporting medical teams. Among them is Chloe Radley, a former makeup artist. She said: “During the first months of the pandemic, I lost the vast majority of my customers and was unable to resume my work so I decided to take the plunge and support our local vaccination programme in an admin role,” she said. “I immediately fell in love with the job and the team, and when my manager encouraged me to apply for another role in the health service I jumped at the chance – I’m now a patient pathway coordinator and find the work so rewarding.” Sajid Javid welcomed the figures. “Thanks to the phenomenal efforts of thousands of volunteer vaccinators during the pandemic, we’ve built a wall of defence against the virus and are learning to live with Covid,” said the health secretary. “I’m delighted that more than 11,000 former volunteers have been inspired by their experiences to now pursue a rewarding career in the NHS, continuing to make a positive difference to people’s lives every day.” The NHS said those who had chosen to take up positions in the NHS after volunteering with the vaccination programme would help the organisation address the backlog of people requiring care. Data suggests the number of people waiting to start routine hospital treatment in England is at a record high, at 6.2 million people. Meanwhile, an analysis of the NHS workforce, excluding those working in primary care, revealed that between September 2020 and September 2021 more than 400 workers in England left the NHS every week because of concerns over work-life balance: a total of 20,834 NHS staff. Amanda Pritchard, the NHS England chief executive, urged others to also consider joining the NHS: “From new starters to people who had retired, thousands took up the call to get jabs in arms in their local communities and it is fantastic that more than 11,000 people have decided to stay with us in another capacity, taking on one of the many rewarding roles across the health service,” she said. “With more than 350 different roles within the NHS – there are roles for everyone so please search NHS careers today, if you are interested in joining us too.”",News/Society,"More than 11,000 decide to join NHS after being part of Covid jab team",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/18/more-than-11000-decide-to-join-nhs-after-being-covid-jab-volunteers
4/18/2022,"‘Iwas super-psyched,” says Kurt Vile, legs bouncing as he perches on the edge of an orange chair. “Just grateful for the gig.” The singer-songwriter is speaking from the basement of his century-old Philadelphia home, taking it easy in the corner of the studio he designed for himself as a hideout for when he’s overwhelmed or nervous. “I hadn’t played in so long,” he explains. Vile is talking about the time, back in November 2020, when Seth Meyers asked him to perform John Prine’s Speed of the Sound of Loneliness on his talkshow. It would be the first time anyone had performed live on the show in eight months, owing to the pandemic, and Vile relished the challenge. Vile is a Prine devotee, as is Meyers, and it would also serve as a tribute: Prine had died of Covid seven months earlier. But the dream soon became a nightmare. As a car took Vile to New York, his back started to throb. At the TV studio, the makeup artist stood on the other side of the dressing room door and told him how to apply blusher. What’s more, Vile had decided to shift the song’s tempo from its usual trot to make it his own, speeding up some bits and slowing others. As he rehearsed alone backstage, however, he worried that he was making a mistake. When the show aired the next day, on Thanksgiving, his fears were confirmed. “People said I had just butchered that song, that John was rolling in his grave.” Vile gives a meek laugh, leaning back so far in his chair he almost disappears. “I felt like I let John Prine down. I spiralled.” That night, Vile slipped away from the family Thanksgivings celebrations and fell into an all-consuming spell of self-doubt, playing guitar and working through his despair alone. By the time he went to bed, he had written Like Exploding Stones, a candid take on his own failures. Synthesisers unwind as he strums his strings, singing slowly about simpler times while ruminating over performance anxieties and the pressure of life in the public eye. “It was,” he says, “an exorcism.” Vile – still skinny and fresh-faced at 42, with a sense of boyish elan – has specialised in carefree stoner jams full of tunefully muttered quips for nearly two decades now. Though written in first-person, his inscrutable songs have long felt resistant to ready interpretation, so the candour of Like Exploding Stones is a fundamental shift. The slow-burning, seven-minute song, recorded as Vile’s band jammed over the tape he made that night, is the first single from (watch my moves), his first album in four years and his most personal yet. It’s also his major-label debut, recorded in the home studio he built with cash from Verve Records. It’s a bold departure from someone who passes as a perpetual teenage skateboarder, clad in flannel and a Cate Le Bon T-shirt, with his basement shower full of skateboards and guitars. “I can be in arenas,” he says, likening himself to Willie Nelson or Bob Dylan. “I know I have the ability, the chops, the songs. And I like the idea of having songs in pop charts, of connecting with people. I have those capabilities.” But can he do all that and hold onto his peculiarity, while dealing with the anxieties these opportunities can bring? Vile talks about his music with intensity and gets frustrated when his breezy songs are seen as tossed off: he believes his last record, 2018’s Bottle It In, was misunderstood, the intricacy overlooked. “That was a deep album. I get so deep and work so hard. I want to blow minds.” He gives a high, impish laugh that’s more of a howl. “I very rarely let music through that might be embarrassing, that I’m not crazy proud of.” Making records became Vile’s raison d’etre soon after his father, a bluegrass obsessive, gave him a banjo for his 14th birthday. He skipped college and moved from the Philadelphia suburbs to downtown, cobbling together a living from various jobs while compiling tapes and recording with his friends and roommates, the War on Drugs. Soon after their 2008 debut, Vile left those psychedelic heartland rockers and signed to Matador, his career bubbling up as indie music trickled into the mainstream. When Matador asked him for a single after he’d been there for more than five years, Vile wrote Pretty Pimpin. “I was trying to write a hit song,” he says, “and I did.” The song has now had 92m Spotify streams. “I’ve touched that area enough that I know I can go there again. I want to do that with every song now, in different ways.” Vile felt he had plateaued within indie, where each new record was trotted out much like the last. “It’s always one little step,” says Vile, who avoids eye contact by staring at the floor until he lands on a point he likes, as he does now. “I put everything I have into all my records and, by the end, I am depleted. How many more times can I do that without trying something new?” After Vile participated in a tribute to the Velvet Underground on the Universal subsidiary Verve, executives there asked about his plans. Newly 40 and at the end of his Matador deal, he reckoned the time had come to jump, not least because Verve’s extended family included the Velvets, as well as Alice and John Coltrane. “I have always been a hustler, thinking about what’s next,” he says. “This was my opportunity to see what happened.” On 11 March 2020, Vile met his longtime manager, Rennie Jaffe, in Philadelphia to sign his new contract and celebrate. Later that night, Donald Trump announced a travel ban, in response to Covid. Despite Vile’s ambitions, this sudden pause and cancellation of his upcoming tour brought a whiff of relief. The musician had struggled for years with what he calls “ping-pong psyche”, thinking more about what was coming next than what was happening now. Part of him longed for the sort of at-home stability the pandemic offered. Stuck in Philly, Vile developed a routine, aided by the fact he had quit drinking the previous year (and smoking weed, more or less). He was in bed by 10pm and up by 7am to drink coffee and read about music before recording until the evening. His daughters – Delphine, nine, and Awilda, 11 – studied upstairs with their mum, Suzanne Lang, Vile’s wife of nearly 20 years. His world got smaller. “We have such beautiful trees here,” he says. “I just started thinking about them.” Vile used the Verve funds to turn his basement into his dream studio, christened OKV Central. The studio is an extension of Vile’s already musical home: in an upstairs room, an organ and piano sit surrounded by books, records and sketchpads. Stacks of albums and tapes crowd every corner of the basement, with the walls serving as shrines to bands Vile loves: Neil Young box sets, Dinosaur Jr setlists, ZZ Top cassettes, Silver Jews liner notes. Vile picks up a photo of the rapper Schoolly D and beams: “Philly pride!” This continuum between work and home life feeds into the new songs, which are confessional in a way Vile has rarely been. Despite his bluster about success and stardom, (watch my moves) is intimate and unguarded, a record of pandemic-era domesticity. “Write about what you see around you,” he croons on the string-laced beauty Chazzy Don’t Mind. “Children and flowers / And days for hours.” The lyrics take in kids’ toys on the windowsill, favourite records on the stereo, new growth in old gardens. His brother Sam and his nephew Coda star in the video for Mount Airy Hill (Way Gone), while his daughters flank their father – hiding behind an alligator mask, naturally – on the album cover. Vile laments the world’s crises during Jesus on a Wire, a charming country number. Playing guitar at home, he concludes, might be all he can do to help now. He agrees that this is his “homecoming” record, acknowledging that the next step – setting off on tour to promote it – may not be easy. “I’m finally coming into my own here, in the woods making music on my own,” he says later by phone, three days into band practice. He slips outside for the first time since rehearsals began and adds: “But in reality, I’m about to get thrown back into these insane times, with all their anxieties.” As his voice trails off, he notes that the weather is wonderful, though he doesn’t know if it will stay that way for long.

4/18/2022,"This week get ready to watch the skies; it is the time of year for the annual Lyrid meteor shower. The chart shows the view looking east from London at 2300 BST on the evening of peak activity, which is the night of 21 April going into 22 April. Although the peak of the shower is not until the early hours of the morning, this year a bright, waning gibbous moon will interfere with the visibility of the fainter shooting stars and so start looking in the earlier part of the night before the moon has risen. The Lyrids originate from Comet Thatcher, which passes close to the sun every 415 years. This leaves a stream of dust in its orbit, which Earth then collides with every year, creating the annual meteor shower. Typically, observers count between five and 20 Lyrids an hour. Although not particularly high in number they can be spectacular, leaving trails across the sky that persist for several seconds. The Lyrids all originate from the radiant point, shown on the chart, that appears to be near the bright star Vega in the constellation of Lyra. Unfortunately, they are more difficult – but not impossible – to see from the southern hemisphere because the radiant is quite far north.",News/Science,Starwatch: search the skies early for the Lyrid meteor shower,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/18/starwatch-search-the-skies-early-for-the-lyrid-meteor-shower
4/18/2022,"Dusk on a pleasantly mild spring evening, and the air is filled with the high-pitched chirping of scores of toads, a sound I first heard on this spot more than 40 years ago. I need to be very careful where I tread: they are emerging from under tree roots and decaying leaves, crossing my path as they leave the wood, returning to their ancestral breeding pond. Next morning, more arrive, clambering over tussocky grass, and even my boot, determined to reach the water: the unstoppable march of the toads, which often ends in tragedy if reaching their goal entails crossing a busy road. Today, the only hazards are my feet and an occasional farm vehicle. Thomas Pennant, the 18th-century Welsh naturalist, called toads “the most deformed and hideous of all animals”, his opinion likely swayed by their warty, toxic skins, down-in-the-mouth countenance and by centuries of associating them with witchcraft. But holding one, it’s hard not to be mesmerised by the beauty of those amber eyes or moved by their primeval breeding instinct. I lowered the struggling amphibian back into the grass, then watched as he plopped into the water. Cumbersome crawling gave way to buoyant breaststroke, propelled by powerful kicks of spade-footed hind legs. Then he floated, mid-pond, taking stock of his surroundings, until ripples spreading from a passing female caught his attention. He set off in pursuit: no luck, she batted him away with a powerful kick. There were plenty more in this pond, many hard to spot on the muddy bottom, others swimming in search of a mate. Some had already paired; large females piggy-backing males that gripped them in amplexus, the mating embrace that only ends when she has wound long strings of eggs around water weeds and he has doused them with his sperm. In a few days this annual toad orgy will be over. They’ll return to a crepuscular existence, only leaving their hiding places to feed after sunset, seldom seen in daylight except in accidental encounters. It’s reassuring to know that they are still here in such numbers, after all these years.

4/18/2022,"Silverchair are arguably one of the most successful Australian bands of all time. With five albums spanning 12 years, all of which crashed into the charts at No 1, 8m international sales and 21 Aria wins, they certainly have the statistics to compete. Musically, each album represented a vast sonic leap from the last – testament to frontman Daniel Johns’ exploratory nature, the band’s musical dexterity, and the whims and fads of youth; when Silverchair retired, they were all only 27. With the release of Johns’ upcoming solo album, FutureNever, this week we’re celebrating the depth and variation of Silverchair’s catalogue with this definitive list. No further arguments: 25. UntitledLet’s kick this countdown off with a rarity, as all self-servingly smug listicles should. When Silverchair were asked to provide a song for the 1998 Godzilla movie, it seemed a fait accompli that one of their dino-stomping riff-o-ramas would accompany slow-motion footage of the titular reptile laying waste to a cityscape. Instead, Silverchair delivered a bleak, untitled, acoustic ballad about eating disorders and suicidal ideation. The film went with Puff Daddy instead. 24. If You Keep Losing SleepIn which Silverchair find themselves in a nightmarish Willy Wonka world of baton-twirling, candy-crunching, bubble-machines, blowing zany melodies at crazed carnival barkers, as Oompa Loompas stomp in concert with the kick drum. It’s the furthest they travelled from the erstwhile grunge of their first album, and probably the song that broke the band up, as Chris and Ben looked at each other, then at the box of slide-whistles in the studio, and wondered how they got to this point. 23. CemeteryThis was the band’s moment of increased maturity, as Johns leaned heavily into his Billy Corgan cauldron and stirred up a thoughtful, well-rounded rock ballad – although the dark fantasy of living in a cemetery has no doubt graced countless teenage diaries for millennia. 22. Reflections of a SoundJust a beautiful latter-era song that, like so many of Johns’ tunes from this period, sounds like the weather finally breaking, musically and lyrically speaking. He also brings back many of the sonic tricks he used on the 2004 Dissociatives record, which is notable for being the only music Johns ever made where he sounds like he was actually having fun. 21. FreakDUN-dundundun-DUN-DUN-DUN-dundundun. The best two-chord riff in existence, appropriately coupled with the most nonsensical lyrics this side of the Andes, with a confusing proto-sci-fi clip that saw a mad scientist capturing the band’s sweat to power some form of rock machine? Whatever. Freak remains a monster song, an outsider anthem to file alongside Creep, Loser and Asshole in your mid-90s nobody-understands-me playlist. 20. Without You“You brighten my life like a polystyrene hat” is an inane simile but luckily, the rest of this song is imbued with enough might to charge past this line: pounding tom-driven drums, a guitar riff that sounds like a lawn mower repeatedly starting up, a waltzing interlude and a crashing chorus that no stray simile can undo. 19. World Upon Your ShouldersOne of the very best moments from Diorama, albeit an often overlooked one, World Upon Your Shoulders opens with a sun-drenched country riff, stutters during halting verses, then opens up into the most gorgeous, life-affirming chorus on the entire album. This song is only hampered by a lyric that reads like a placeholder: “Violent, big and violent / you’re like a thing that’s big and violent.” Indeed. 18. FindawayThe closest thing to a pop song on their first album, Frogstomp, despite pop songs being absolutely against everything any earnest 15-year-old grunge band in industrial Newcastle stands for. They hid it towards the end of the album, but we still found it. 17. Luv Your LifeAn unabashed love letter to Johns’ then-wife Natalie Imbruglia, with all the do-do sections, plonking piano, and sweet cooing vocals that such a thing requires. It almost would have been too twee, save for the breathtaking “flinch against the fire” bridge that lifts Luv Your Life from a treacly luv declaration and into something else entirely. 16. Punk Song 2A great pop-rock basher that was buried away as the B-side to the Freak single. Perhaps for this reason, the guitars roar a little more, Johns’ vocal is pleasingly unprocessed and the band sound like they are smashing this thing out in the same room, first take, no overdubs. Wait until the second chorus kicks in, and it becomes apparent that Johns was bleeding great melodies during this late-teenage period. 15. The Greatest ViewDriven by a twanging 12-string Rickenbacker riff, The Greatest View was a palette cleanser that rid the dark aftertaste of Neon Ballroom, and drove Johns’ increasingly public health struggles far from front of mind. With this song, Johns let you know that he has the clearest vision of where he actually is, what is going on around him, and where he is heading. You almost believe him, too. 14. FaultlineThe best outro in the entire Silverchair discography, and with mature, haunting lyrics about the Newcastle earthquake, of all things, this is the most classically well-written song from Frogstomp. The flipside of Pure Massacre, although in both songs people are dying “for no reason at all”. 13. Across the NightIn Silverchair’s sonic timeline, Across the Night is the scene in Wizard of Oz where everything goes from black and white to eye-smashing technicolor. Strings swoop, Johns wavers into falsetto and mostly stays there, and genius composer Van Dyke Parks weaves parts of every single Disney soundtrack into the tapestry. It is an ambitious and excellent song. And Johns somehow manages to avoid sounding pretentious while singing, “T’was the moon that stole my slumber” or insane by declaring “I hugged a man’s arthritic shoulder.” Very hard to do! 12. Straight LinesWhen Young Modern arrived, Silverchair were a band in name only. This stunning lead single, which crashed into No 1 and became their most successful song to date, was co-written with The Presets’ Julian Hamilton, who has writing credits on four of the album’s 11 songs. It’s a buoyant, forward-marching pop song, the sound of Johns leaving his teenage band behind and following the yellow brick road to where it may lead. Maybe towards a neck tat? 11. Tuna in the BrineFor all the ceremony of Diorama’s suite of glorious singles, the album’s ambitious heart beats truest within Tuna in the Brine, a six-minute symphony that soars like an opera, glides across multiple avant garde movements, and makes the most of Parks’ string and brass arrangement abilities. Like all great songs, it saves the best until the end. 10. Spawn AgainThe biggest outlier in the Silverchair catalogue, and as close as they would skirt to the wallet chained, trenchcoat wearing crowd of the late-90s. Spawn Again is metal machine music with “meat is murder” lyrics and an unhinged, anguished vocal. Still in mint condition on well-worn copies of Neon Ballroom due to being one of the most-skipped songs of the CD era (wedged uncomfortably between Ana’s Song and Miss You Love), it roars like the mighty protest song it is. 9. SlaveFreak Show is divided between songs built on big riffs, and transitional songs that point towards the pomp and drama of Neon Ballroom. This is the former, and it is a perfect opening song: a thudding, bloodying, lumbering rock beast that cycles through a series of massive riffs before the vocals hit and implore you not to over-think any of it. 8. Israel’s Son“I want you to know that I want you dead” is only one of the troubling lyrics to be found here – taken not from Johns’ twisted psyche, but instead, like many of his early songs, from watching SBS documentaries about our broken planet. The subsonic bassline that opens this song, and their first album, is worth the price of admission alone. 7. Emotion SicknessFrom the machine gun orchestra that announces its arrival, through multiple tempo shifts and instrumental flourishes, Emotion Sickness was the first Silverchair song that even your high-school music teacher couldn’t deny. A statement of intent, like all the band’s album openers were, this was the biggest sonic and stylistic leap the band ever made. From here on out, Silverchair were painting from a wider colour palette, for better or worse. 6. After All These YearsThe type of beautiful and fragile song that could only be arrived at by someone who was self-taught at piano, with all the ambition and joy of discovery without the rapped knuckles that edit out unorthodox voicings and chord choices. Attached to this are some of Johns’ most open-hearted lyrics, a pristine performance, and vocal lines so pure they recall Brian Wilson at his most creative. 5. The DoorAnother of the big riff songs from Freak Show, The Door distills the eastern influences pervasive in western rock, sounds that drifted across from India via the Beatles, blew through Led Zeppelin to Soundgarden, and ended up bobbing in the shallows at Merewether Beach. The best headbanging song in their canon. 4. Paint Pastel PrincessTucked away at the end of Neon Ballroom is the most overlooked song in Silverchair’s entire catalogue. This little gem sprinkles nonsensical alliteration over swooping strings, weaves in a dancing guitar line dipped in effects, and builds towards Johns’ finest chorus. Paint Pastel Princess is the sonic equivalent of those turn-of-the-century Silverchair gigs at which Johns was caked in eyeliner and dressed like a mirror ball Bowie, while the other two lads were still rocking cargo shorts. 3. Ana’s SongIf Cemetery was the song that signalled that Silverchair were growing up, this was the one that announced their arrival as a serious band. “Ana” is the personification of an eating disorder that had plagued Johns and signposted an ever-increasing struggle for control of his own life. Not at all self-indulgent, with most of the messaging cloaked in poetry and melody, it remains a high water mark for his songwriting. 2. Miss You LoveThis beautiful ballad combines Johns’ most poetic lyrics with a wonderful melody. The “big” sections are used sparingly, the arrangement isn’t clogged with instruments, and Johns’ uncertain vocal is a masterclass in how to emote without overdoing it. Beautiful. 1. TomorrowBack when the Newcastle Water Board was flooding the mainstream with propaganda, it took a plucky 15-year-old to tell the truth about the hard-to-drink liquid travelling through the city’s pipes. With this immaculately crafted epic, Silverchair arrived fully formed, scoring a #1 single that went on to be the most played song on US rock radio in 1995. The EP version is slightly preferable to the one re-recorded for Frogstomp, mostly because it sounds a little rougher around the edges – clearly made by three teenagers who just wanna throw every idea they have into the pot and see how it tastes.",Arts/Music,The 25 best Silverchair songs – sorted,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/18/the-25-best-silverchair-songs-sorted
4/18/2022,"“John was the sort of man,” Anne Darwin tells us in voiceover early in this drama, “who would buy a Range Rover we couldn’t afford and then spend £3,000 on a personalised number plate.” We all know that sort of man. Perhaps you’re married to him. If so – and while I’m not a professional marriage counsellor – my advice is: pack a bag and never look back. Instead, like a more tragicomic Tammy Wynette, Anne stood by her man. Until she could stand him no more, that is. The big question asked by Unforgotten creator Chris Lang’s dramatisation of real events, The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe (ITV), is why it took her so long. You may remember the Darwins. In 2002, the 51-year-old former teacher and prison officer paddled a canoe up the coast from his home in Seaton Carew, Co Durham, capsized the boat, faked his own death and hid out for a bit. In the meantime, his wife reported him missing, lied to their two sons about her husband’s fate and claimed the life insurance with the – to my mind utterly fantastical – idea that ultimately the couple would resume their marriage, debt free. “What could be simpler?” John (Eddie Marsan) asks Anne (Monica Dolan) in the drama. “It’ll all be over in a couple of weeks, I promise you.” Marsan is terrific in the role – a small-town Walter Mitty who is both wild eyed and deluded. His patchy north-east accent is no match for Dolan’s, however, which sounds like Sarah Millican’s with less helium. Dolan’s best work here, though, is to appear both biddable and doubtful. Her sad eyes tell us that Anne thinks John’s plan is as cunning as one of Baldrick’s. After returning furtively to the family home, John began a new life, holed up in a room that was hidden behind a wardrobe. “Where’s the last place anyone would think of looking?” John asks Anne rhetorically in the drama. “Next door! Genius!” Neither Canoe Man nor ex-Mrs Canoe Man were involved in this drama, which gives Lang freedom to imagine how the couple went through with their folly. Lang made his name on the peerless cold-case drama Unforgotten, and here his droll and disobliging reimagining of the Darwins’ survival of the dimmest ensures that the couple will remain unforgettable. He tells the story from Anne’s perspective, which serves to make her more sympathetic than her man-baby spouse. In one scene after his disappearance, she is at home struggling to keep the lie afloat with police and family when, calamitously, the phone rings. It’s John, calling from a phone box in the woods to complain. “My mattress keeps deflating,” he whines like a child midway through the orienteering module of the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme. “I haven’t had hot food in three days and I’ve got chilblains.” Lang’s inclination here is to play the story for laughs. That’s understandable – they are a laughable pair – but often, the dialogue lacks verisimilitude. Only occasionally does Lang’s drama rise to the pathos of Ed Sinclair’s Landscapers, starring Olivia Colman and David Thewlis, about another pair of real-life Brits not cut out for their life of crime. But then, Christopher and Susan Edwards, who murdered her appalling parents then buried them in the couple’s Mansfield garden before fleeing to France, were more sympathetic than the Darwins. The challenge here is to explain why Anne, though neither stupid nor venal, went along with her marital muppet’s plan to mug off the authorities and live off ill-gotten gains. Lang, in what probably amounts to poetic licence, has Anne tell the true story of a woman who held on to the rope of a rising hot-air balloon. There came a moment when the only way to survive was not letting go. The analogy is clear: John’s insurance scam is the rope and doing the right thing is the ground, steadily disappearing from view. As for John Darwin, truth is dafter than fiction. He was heard of last month, heading for Ukraine, aged 71, to fight against the Russians. When asked about his chances of survival, John’s second wife told reporters: “He will have a bullet proof vest and good life insurance, good for me.” Unless, of course, he plans to fake his own death.

4/18/2022,"Women who speak out about gender inequality are often dismissed, especially in England. After all, women here are lucky – we are much better off than in other countries. Aren’t we? The short answer is, only some of us. Devastating new data analysis from the Health Foundation has revealed – on the starkest measure – that for many women in England, that is far from being the case. Life expectancy for women in the poorest parts of England is less than the overall life expectancy for women in every OECD country in the world besides Mexico. Let that sink in for a second. Lower than every other country in that club, bar one. In 2017-19 female life expectancy in the most deprived local areas of England was 78.7 years. In the richest areas, it was 86.4 years. What does that say about the situation for England’s poorest women in 2022? It tells us that women are the “shock absorbers of poverty”, according to the Women’s Budget Group. Women are more likely to be poor and have more debt than men. Because of unpaid caring responsibilities often they can work fewer hours, and as a result have fewer savings and smaller pensions. For minoritised and disabled women, the picture is even bleaker. When the social safety net is slashed – as it has been, repeatedly, for more than a decade – it is women who fall first through the cracks. “There’s really clear evidence that poverty is related to lower life expectancy,” says Jemima Olchawski, chief executive of the Fawcett Society. “Over a decade of austerity and rising poverty levels have hit women hardest. They’re more likely to be working on the lowest incomes, to be lone parents or to retire with a lower pension.” It is not poverty alone that has an impact on life expectancy – inequality in and of itself, is bad for people, she adds. “So high levels of inequality will be contributing to shorter lifespans for these women – that’s a really important part of this picture.” Mandu Reid, leader of the Women’s Equality Party, agrees. “Women are paying a heavy price for a one size fits men approach to planning the economy,” she said. Reid, a woman not easily blind-sided by dismal gender inequality statistics, admits to being genuinely shocked at the new analysis. “Political choices are being made that benefit those who have always benefited,” she says. “This data tells us very clearly that we are not using our abundant wealth to address inequality. There is no way we should be in that position. No way.” The data snapshot was taken before the pandemic. A pandemic which resulted in twice as many (43%) young women from low-income households saying their financial situation had deteriorated, compared with 21% of higher-income young women and just 16% of higher-income men. In their report on the unequal gendered economic impacts of the pandemic, the Commons women and equalities committee concluded “existing gendered inequalities in the economy have been ignored and sometimes exacerbated by the pandemic policy response”. In December, the government pledged to “reset the dial” on women’s health in England, with its Vision for Women’s Health strategy, after 100,000 women came forward to share their healthcare concerns. With muttering that it was about bloody time that the rampant sexism in healthcare was recognised, that was welcomed. But even the most dazzling of healthcare visions can achieve nothing without resources and long-term commitment. And even then, it will have little impact on this most stark of bottom lines if women’s longstanding and persistently unequal position in society is not addressed. With the government refusing to carry out a review into the cost of childcare that keeps so many women out of work, no commitment to restoring the £20 universal credit uplift and the cost of living crisis biting hard there seems little sign of that. “We’re moving into a cost of living crisis, which again, will hit women the hardest,” says Olchawski. “The potential impact of that is terrifying.”",News/Inequality,‘Shock absorbers of poverty’: women’s lives cut short by their unequal position in society,https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/apr/17/shock-absorbers-of-poverty-womens-lives-cut-short-by-their-unequal-position-in-society
4/18/2022,"Florida’s education department has rejected 54 mathematics textbooks from next year’s school curriculum, citing alleged references to critical race theory among a range of reasoning for some of the rejections, officials announced. The department said in a news release Friday that some of the books had been rejected for failure to comply with the state’s content standards, Benchmarks for Excellent Student Thinking [Best], but that 21% of the books were disallowed “because they incorporate prohibited topics or unsolicited strategies, including CRT”. Department officials disapproved an additional 11 books “because they do not properly align to Best Standards and incorporate prohibited topics or unsolicited strategies, including CRT”. Critical race theory is an academic practice that examines the ways in which racism operates in US laws and society. The release does not list the titles of the books or provide any extracts to offer reasons why the books were removed. The announcement follows a series of hardline measures by Republicans in the state to alter teaching in schools as conservatives thrust the issue of critical race theory into the country’s ongoing political culture wars. In June last year, the Florida board of education ruled to ban the teaching of critical race theory in public schools. That included the teaching of the New York Times’s Pulitzer prize-winning series the 1619 Project, which re-examines American history in the context of slavery and its consequences. In a statement, Florida’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis welcomed the education department’s announcement and accused some textbook publishers of “indoctrinating” children with “concepts like race essentialism, especially, bizarrely, for elementary school students”. Florida Democrats rebuked the announcement. Democratic state representative Carlos G Smith argued on Twitter that DeSantis had “turned our classrooms into political battlefields and this is just the beginning”. Swathes of Republican-controlled states in the US have passed measures seeking to ban the teaching of critical race theory, which will probably be a prominent conservative talking point in this year’s midterm elections. Many of those bills and orders are vaguely worded, leading to fears of censorship on school and college campuses around the country.",News/US news,Florida rejects 54 math textbooks over ‘prohibited topics’ including critical race theory,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/17/florida-rejects-math-textbooks-critical-race-theory
