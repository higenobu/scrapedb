2/26/2022,"In his novel The English Patient, Michael Ondaatje mentions “a violent and cold southwesterly known to Berbers as ‘that which plucks the fowls’”. Wind really can produce this effect, with 19th-century meteorologists recording several instances of chickens stripped of their feathers by tornadoes. Some thought the phenomenon might give valuable clues on the mystery of how fast winds moved inside a tornado. Prof Elias Loomis set out to investigate, armed with a cannon and a supply of freshly killed chickens. He found that firing birds at a muzzle velocity of 340mph stripped off their feathers, but also reduced the chickens to small fragments. Loomis suspected the gunpowder blast might have been a factor in the shredding, but concluded that the windspeed in a tornado was less than 340mph. The 20th-century invention of the wind tunnel offered a more scientific way to explore the phenomenon. The meteorologist Bernard Vonnegut – brother of the novelist Kurt – reviewed previous work and observed that it could be affected by “flight moult”, a reaction in which panicking birds shed feathers. This is assumed to be an evolutionary adaptation to ensure predators get only a mouthful of feathers. Flight moult means that feathers may come out at relatively low wind speeds, leading Vonnegut to conclude that “the plucking phenomenon … is not indicative of winds as intense as might be supposed”.",News/News,Weatherwatch: can wind ever be strong enough to pluck a chicken?,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/26/weatherwatch-can-wind-pluck-chicken

2/26/2022,"Our daughter loves to leave her greens on her plate, and we (almost as much) love trying to come up with ways of reincorporating them into her next meal. We blend them into batter with other leftover vegetables to make rainbow pancakes; or finely chop, saute and add cream, to make creamed greens; or add them to soups and stews such as today’s classic Portuguese soup that’s traditionally made with cabbage, potatoes and often chorizo. Mine is a vegetarian version that we used to serve at Poco in Bristol and that our daughter will wolf down quite happily. At the restaurant, we’d add celeriac and sea lettuce as well as potato, to give the soup some extra umami; you could also add leftover cooked meat such as shredded roast chicken, sliced ham or sausage. Once made, the soup will keep for four to five days in the fridge. This comforting soup works well with either leftover cooked potatoes, greens (rainbow chard, kale, cabbage or spring greens) and meat, or with uncooked veg (I used rainbow chard, which gives the soup a warming, yellow colour). It’s hard to imagine that such a humble dish could be so satisfying, yet somehow the combination of greens and potatoes, cooked and blended until creamy, is utterly delicious. The addition of celeriac, washed but unpeeled, with the potatoes is optional, but does add another dimension of flavour. With the exception of the very rooty end, which is best trimmed and composted, celeriac skin is completely edible and will tenderise and turn delicious and palatable with a little cooking (or finely grated, if using it in a salad).

Bring back to a boil, turn down to a simmer, cover and leave to cook for 15-20 minutes, until the vegetables are tender. Blitz the soup until half of it is blended but you still have plenty of intact cubes of potato and celeriac, then stir in the sea lettuce (if using), greens and parsley, and simmer for five to 10 minutes more, until soft.

2/26/2022,"What were you hoping for?If not the love of my life, then at least a couple of good anecdotes. First impressions?Tall! Easy to chat to and equally as curious about how the Guardian’s matchmaking works. What did you talk about?Creative careers. Holidaying vs travelling. Family. Climate dread. His chocolate addiction and screenwriting ventures. Any awkward moments?When he said he wasn’t drinking due to an extended dry Jan and I was halfway through a glass of wine. Good table manners?Definitely. He was keen to share lots of food and even let me take home our barely drunk bottle of wine. Best thing about Dean?He was interested in lots of things, so we had plenty to talk about. Would you introduce him to your friends?Most of them. Blind date is Saturday’s dating column: every week, two strangers are paired up for dinner and drinks, and then spill the beans to us, answering a set of questions. This runs, with a photograph we take of each dater before the date, in Saturday magazine (in the UK) and online at theguardian.com every Saturday. It’s been running since 2009 – you can read all about how we put it together here.What questions will I be asked?We ask about age, location, occupation, hobbies, interests and the type of person you are looking to meet. If you do not think these questions cover everything you would like to know, tell us what’s on your mind. Can I choose who I match with?No, it’s a blind date! But we do ask you a bit about your interests, preferences, etc – the more you tell us, the better the match is likely to be. Can I pick the photograph?No, but don't worry: we'll choose the nicest ones. What personal details will appear?Your first name, job and age. How should I answer?Honestly but respectfully. Be mindful of how it will read to your date, and that Blind date reaches a large audience, in print and online. Will I see the other person’s answers?No. We may edit yours and theirs for a range of reasons, including length, and we may ask you for more details. Will you find me The One?We’ll try! Marriage! Babies! Can I do it in my home town?Only if it’s in the UK. Many of our applicants live in London, but we would love to hear from people living elsewhere. How to applyEmail blind.date@theguardian.com Describe Dean in three words?Tall, interesting, easygoing. What do you think he made of you?Hard to tell – he didn’t ask a lot of questions so I felt like the one doing all the interrogating. Although he did look disappointed when I said Dune was an average film … Did you go on somewhere?Nope. And … did you kiss?No. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?I think Dean would have liked a drink, because he looked lovingly at, and sniffed, my glass of wine. Marks out of 10?7. Would you meet again?I don’t think the vibe was there, but sure, everyone deserves a second chance. What were you hoping for?The love of my life. First impressions?I wasn’t attracted to her and knew that wouldn’t change, so I decided to enjoy the meal and conversation instead. What did you talk about?The workings of Guardian Blind Date. Galleries. Julia’s cheesemaking. She asked a lot of questions, which made me conscious that the conversation was a little one-way at times, but she seemed genuinely interested in my life as a freelancer. Any awkward moments?We both struggled to work out the menu. Good table manners?I was too busy shovelling food in my mouth to notice any glaring faux pas. Best thing about Julia?Easygoing. She seemed like quite a sweet person and knew how to keep the conversation flowing. Would you introduce her to your friends?It wouldn’t get that far, I’m afraid. Describe Julia in three words?Open, unassuming, polite. What do you think she made of you?It had been a long day and she said I perked up when dessert arrived, so maybe I was a tad lacklustre. Did you go on somewhere?No, we walked together to the tube. And … did you kiss?No. I think it was clear from the off that there was no chemistry. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?A more suitable match. Marks out of 10?6. Would you meet again?I wouldn’t. Dean and Julia ate at the White Horse in Mayfair, London W1. Fancy a blind date?

2/26/2022,"Iam sitting in the kitchen in front of my laptop, drinking coffee in the sluggish morning light, just back from the southwestern leg of the band’s 2022 tour. I am exhausted, my stuff is still piled in a big pyramid in the sitting room, and my shoulder aches where the banjo strap catches it. “Would you care to know,” I say, “where our album currently sits on the official UK Folk chart?” The oldest one looks up, composing his features into a careful, blank expression. “Go on, then,” he says. “It’s currently at 31,” I say. “Isn’t that where it was last week?” he says. “It’s a monthly chart,” I say. “It only changes every 30 days.” “So this is just a reminder,” he says. “Your daily reminder,” I say. The tortoise stomps past, a look of unmistakable fury on his face. “He’s raging,” the oldest one says. “He wants out,” I say. “But it’s too early.” My wife walks in, in a similar, stately rage. “When are you gonna move your stuff?” she says. She does not stay long enough to hear my answer. I watch as the tortoise attempts, not for the first time, to leave through the cat flap; I know from experience that he’s about a centimetre too wide. He stays wedged in there, preventing the cat from coming and going, before backing out and taking up an angrier position in the middle of the room. Later on the sun comes out, the air warms up and the garden door gets left open. The tortoise escapes, as he often does at this time of year. I have learned to let him enjoy these temporary victories. He thunks down the back steps in a bid for freedom and heads in a southerly direction, imagining that the halved tomato he finds in his path is his discovery, and not my doing. That afternoon I look up from my computer to see the tortoise strolling across the lawn, with the cat riding him like a horse. He is wary enough of general threats to retreat into his shell whenever a shadow is cast across him, but takes no notice of a cat standing on his back. It is just one more humiliation on a long list that includes the knitted dinosaur costume we put him in at Christmas. When I next look up, both cat and tortoise are gone. Later still, when the temperature has plunged and the rains have returned and my wife has gone to bed before Newsnight has even started, she sends me a text from upstairs: an emoji of a tortoise. Encoded in this text is an instruction: go out into the cold wet night and retrieve the tortoise from wherever he is hiding. On Tuesdays I might also get an emoji of a recycling bin, but it’s only Monday. I go into the kitchen, where the oldest one is still sitting at his computer, now in a recreational capacity. The wind is whistling outside, and the rain is lashing the skylight above my head. “Is this, like, a named storm?” I say. “I haven’t named it,” he says. “I mean officially,” I say. “Sorry, what are we talking about?” he says, looking up. “Nothing,” I say. “I need to get the tortoise.” “Ugh,” he says. Even a few nights on a stage in front of an audience will inflate the ordinary ego to an extent that a conscious effort is required to shrink oneself back down to size when you get home. I don’t know what remedies other people use, but half an hour searching for a tortoise in driving rain usually does it for me. Every season he adds a new hiding place to his rotation, to make it just a little bit harder. Eventually, I spot a protruding foot by the light of my phone, and find him in his latest bolthole under the ivy. I pick up the cold doorstop weight of him, carry him inside and place him gently under the dog’s bed. Then I send my wife a thumb’s up emoji and lock the back door. Sitting back down in front of Newsnight, I think about what this routine must be like for the tortoise: every day he makes a daring escape, and every morning he wakes up in the same spot under the dog’s bed, as if it had all been a dream. It’s probably not so bad, I think – exciting and frustrating by turns, but with a rhythm to it that must become familiar, even comforting over time. I look over at the giant pyramid of my stuff, still untouched, and think: 31, all month.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Tim Dowling: hunting for a tortoise in driving rain will shrink my inflated ego nicely,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/26/tim-dowling-hunting-for-a-tortoise-in-driving-rain-will-shrink-my-inflated-ego-nicely
2/26/2022,"Abright day. Crisp, clear, cornflower sky. One of those February days. You know the kind. Pre-pre-spring. Utterly still. No hint of Dudley, Eunice or Franklin. I have a regular walk. Up the hill, through the estate, into the small wood at the top of Streatham Common. A fragment of peace in London’s sprawling suburbia. And on this still morning, it soothes the soul. An insistent great tit, its strident two-note call pinging around the canopy; a wren, machine-gun burst from a nearby bush; a black labrador, galumphing and panting; a robin, its silvery ribbon of song disguising the awkward reality of its intrinsic belligerence. Lovely stuff. And then, a sound to make my head snap up. Drrrrrrrrr. A great spotted woodpecker. Most birds sing. But every band needs a drummer. Drrrrrrrr. The sound of a beak hitting wood 20 times a second. One of the first indicators that winter might soon – please, please – be coming to an end. My first this year was in early January, but since then, silence. This is a welcome return. It goes again – louder but still invisible – and I scan the canopy, seeking but not finding. Wouldn’t you get a headache? Well, of course – even if you could move your head that quickly, you would. I would too. But we don’t have thick skulls with a spongy lining, wrapped around the brain to minimise rattling. We don’t have a hyoid bone coiled round our head like a helmet. We can’t contract our neck muscles milliseconds before impact to further lessen the shock. And – unrelated to the drumming, but equally fascinating – we don’t have sticky tongues that wrap themselves round the inside of our heads and then unfurl to lap up insects and larvae and all sorts of other delicious stuff. We are, in short, woefully equipped to live the life of a woodpecker. I’m in danger of getting a crick in my neck. Still no sign of the noisy, elusive drummer. Then it shuffles out from behind the trunk – a piebald bringer of cheer – and fossicks in the bark briefly for my delectation, before taking off and bouncing away over my head.
