4/26/2022,"Cults make prophetic promises they can almost never fulfill, which in turn leads them to revise those guarantees in order to keep their flock in line and their scams alive. In that regard, few have faced a bigger obstacle than the Remnant Fellowship Church, whose founder and leader Gwen Shamblin routinely preached that being faithful to God—primarily by maintaining a slim waistline and training children to be docile and subservient—resulted in glorious financial, familial, and spiritual rewards. That was all well and good during the prosperous Remnant Fellowship times, but it became an onerous problem on May 29, 2021, when a plane piloted by Shamblin’s husband Joe Lara crashed on its way to a Florida MAGA rally, instantly killing Shamblin and everyone else on board. ‘Barry’ Is Still Darkly Hilarious—and the Best Show on TV That tragedy served as a de facto cliffhanger for The Way Down: God, Greed, and the Cult of Gwen Shamblin, HBO Max’s docuseries from last September, and it’s where director Marina Zenovich picks up with The Way Down Part 2, a two-installment coda that investigates what this calamity has meant for the Remnant Fellowship Church and Shamblin’s attendant Weigh Down Workshop diet business. The latter was the vehicle that first brought fame and fortune to Shamblin herself, a nutritionist who argued that true believers should transfer their hunger for food into devotion to the Almighty. It was a program that contended that shedding pounds was an act of piousness, and via books, VHS tapes, and in-church classes, it made Shamblin a national sensation. Moreover, it allowed her to form the Remnant Fellowship Church, a Brentwood, Tennessee-based religious organization that Zenovich’s exposé revealed to be an insular Christian cult that punished the heavyset, isolated members from friends and relatives, brainwashed children into embracing its Holy Trinity-denying doctrine, oppressed women through misogynistic power structures, and urged parents to abuse and beat their children into obedient submission. Notable for both her charismatic sermons and her ever-growing hair (which eventually topped out at a remarkable foot-high beehive), Shamblin promoted the notion that splendid things came to those who knelt before God, while bad things were the byproduct of unfaithfulness. Thus, her untimely demise—even more than the prior, sudden death of her granddaughter—was a monumental complication for the church. The Way Down’s second part is curious about how the organization’s leaders will explain this situation to their legions of members, and whether anyone will buy what they’re selling. Yet what it comes up with is more than a bit deflating. Waiting six months before delivering its final two installments was, apparently, not long enough, as director Zenovich offers few insights into the future of Remnant Fellowship Church, whose plans for reconfiguring its doctrine—and hierarchical structure—remain in flux, or at least still largely hidden from public view. With no exciting bombshells about either the church’s subsequent phase or about the fate of Lara’s former partner Natasha Pavlovich and their daughter, The Way Down shifts its attention to the plane crash itself. Early indications are that Shamblin’s amateur-pilot husband Lara—a former actor who clearly married Shamblin less out of love or devoutness than out of a desire for a wealthy benefactor who’d grant him the high life (and country music career) he craved—was ill equipped to handle the type of plane, and low-visibility weather conditions, he faced on the day of the catastrophe. CGI recreations of the craft’s flight plan, set to Lara’s final radio transmissions, corroborate that theory, although as one official remarks, it’s certainly possible that a technical malfunction could have caused the fatal accident. As with Remnant Fellowship Church’s sustainability, it’s simply too early to tell. Consequently, The Way Down’s return engagement feels decidedly premature. There are tantalizing intimations that Shamblin’s daughter Elizabeth—seen looking frighteningly skeletal in archival video clips—might not be the heir apparent everyone assumed she’d be, and there’s more predictable news that Elizabeth’s brother Michael (whose relationship with the church was always rocky) has divorced his wife and severed ties with his mom’s empire. For the most part, however, Zenovich seems to have jumped the gun on detailing what’s next for Shamblin’s cult and the many acolytes she nurtured along the way, providing scant revelations that might propel her story forward. These two supplementary episodes feel like addenda that, in most respects, end the saga on an indefinite note, unsure of what Remnant Fellowship Church will look like during its ensuing era—if, that is, it continues to exist at all. Without much in the way of intriguing developments, The Way Down turns inward for its closing chapter, addressing the way in which Remnant Fellowship Church countered the negative publicity generated by the docuseries’ late-2021 premiere. Even there, though, Zenovich informs us about unsurprising measures taken by Shamblin’s successors—namely, correspondences to HBO that denied all the claims against them, and web sites set up to propagate their self-serving narratives. Naturally, Remnant Fellowship Church didn’t like being outed as a cult that counseled men to keep wives and daughters under their authoritarian thumb; that fully supported child-murdering members Joseph and Sonya Smith, who were convicted of killing their 8-year-old son Josef; and that was run like a money-making venture designed to line the pockets of Shamblin and Lara, who enjoyed the myriad fruits of their followers’ labor. But that was evident before, and The Way Down Part 2 adds little detail or nuance to such ideas. Most surprising of all is that The Way Down’s second part features interviews with a handful of Remnant survivors who came forward after last fall’s premiere, but barely takes the time to flesh out their stories. Instead, these individuals put more effort into defending themselves against online claims that they’re gullible dupes than they do recounting their harrowing personal ordeals, which is frustrating both because their contentions are less than totally convincing (given the abject nonsense Shamblin peddled), and because they offer nothing that expands our understanding of Remnant Fellowship Church’s day-to-day operations. The most director Zenovich derives from these conversations is that Shamblin was reportedly homophobic as well—hardly the sort of eye-opener that justifies this disappointingly meager follow-up.

4/26/2022,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — North Dakota’s longest-serving state senator announced Monday that he would resign following a report that he had traded scores of text messages with a man jailed on child pornography charges. Republican Ray Holmberg, who rose to become one of the state’s most powerful lawmakers in a career that spanned 46 years, said he would resign effective June 1. His term was scheduled to end on Nov. 30 and he already had announced in March that it would be his last. “Recent news stories have become a distraction for the important work of the legislative assembly during its interim meetings,” Holmberg, 79, said in a statement announcing his resignation. “I want to do what I can, within my power, to lessen such distractions.” Holmberg did not immediately return messages from The Associated Press on Monday. His attorney, Mark Friese, said he didn't have anything to add beyond Holmberg's statement. Friese, a prominent North Dakota criminal defense attorney, said Tuesday that Holmberg hasn’t been charged with any crime, and there is no indication that he will. GOP Gov. Doug Burgum said in a statement he “supports Sen. Holmberg’s decision to resign.” He did not elaborate. Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner said he spoke with Holmberg earlier about his future in the Legislature. “No charges have been brought against Sen. Holmberg at this time ... he felt it was in the best interest to resign at this time,"" Wardner said. Days after the published report about his text messages, Holmberg had announced that he would step down as head of a powerful panel that oversees the Legislature’s business between sessions. The Forum of Fargo reported April 15 that Holmberg exchanged 72 text messages in August with Nicholas James Morgan-Derosier. Prosecutors allege Morgan-Derosier possessed several thousand images and videos depicting sexually abused children. He also is accused of taking two children under the age of 10 from Minnesota to his Grand Forks home, with the intent of sexually abusing them. Holmberg first told the Forum that he had read a newspaper story about the charges, then in a later interview said he had not, the Forum reported. He told the Forum that his text messages with Morgan-Derosier were related to “a variety of things,” including patio work Morgan-Derosier did for him. He also told the newspaper that he no longer has the text messages. “They’re just gone,” he said. Holmberg has been one of the Legislature’s most powerful lawmakers for decades, serving as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He chaired the Legislative Management committee, which decides committee assignments and chooses study topics that often inspire legislation, four times. He also sat on the state’s Emergency Commission, which allocates funding and resources in times of an emergency, and served on or chaired several GOP-led redistricting committees. When he announced in March that this would be his last term, he said the stress of a session and a campaign would “only exacerbate a weakened ability to concentrate on the matters at hand and effectively recall events.” Many North Dakota Republicans, including Burgum, showered Holmberg with accolades at the time. Holmberg will remain on the Legislature’s payroll through May and on its state-funded health insurance plan through July, a benefit that is worth about $1,425 monthly.",U.S./Associated Press,North Dakota lawmaker quits after child porn suspect texts,https://news.yahoo.com/north-dakota-lawmaker-quits-child-172043018.html
4/26/2022,"Corporate voices boomed across the nation in support of Black Lives Matter and various social justice initiatives following the death of George Floyd in 2020. Nearly two years later, what was left in the wake of 2020 was a drastic spike Black murders with experts pinning blame on the BLM and defund the police movements. The summer of 2020 was marked by protests and riots from coast to coast in support of the BLM and defund the police movements following the death of George Floyd. Companies stretching from behemoth e-commerce and tech company Amazon to beauty giant Ulta posted messages reiterating ""Black lives matter,"" and companies around the country pledged millions of dollars to various social justice organizations that pushed to reimagine policing and reallocate funds from police departments. FBI data reported by Fox News Digital last week shows murders spiked disproportionally among Black Americans in 2020 by 32% compared to the year prior. Murders across the board spiked by nearly 30% that year, marking the largest single-year increase in killings since the agency began tracking the crimes. MASSIVE INCREASE IN BLACK AMERICANS MURDERED WAS RESULT OF DEFUND POLICE MOVEMENT: EXPERTS At least 7,484 Black Americans were murdered in 2019, according to FBI data Fox News Digital reported last week. That number shot up to at least 9,941 murders in 2020, meaning there was an increase of 2,457 Black Americans murdered over the previous year. For White Americans, FBI data show there were 7,043 White people murdered in 2020, meaning 2,898 more Black people were killed compared to Whites. An average of 6,927 Black Americans were murdered each year between 2010 and 2019, meaning Black murders shot up by 43% in 2020 compared to the previous 10-year average. AMAZON SUSPENDS BLACK LIVES MATTER FROM CHARITY PROGRAM AS CONTROVERSY SWIRLS AROUND GROUP'S FINANCES To experts such as the Manhattan Institute’s Heather Mac Donald, BLM and the defund movements that swept the nation directly contributed to the spike. The spike ""began months after lockdowns beginning only after riots,"" Mac Donald told Fox News Digital, noting the ""spike was not at all related to COVID."" Fox News Digital reached out to a handful of corporations and companies that pledged support for Black Lives Matter and various organizations supporting tenets of the defund movement, such as the Equal Justice Initiative and the National Urban League in the days and months following the death of Floyd. The Equal Justice Initiative advocates for the reallocations of ""funds from traditional policing to services that promote public safety."" While the National Urban League outlines on its website that it has ""21 Pillars"" on ""comprehensive and realistic reform and accountability,"" including ""collaborate with communities to re-envision public safety"" and ""change divisive policing policies."" Representatives for Nike, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Ben & Jerry’s, Nordstrom, Target and Ulta did not return Fox News Digital’s requests for comment. Companies such as Nordstrom, Ben & Jerry’s and Amazon openly aligned themselves with Black Lives Matter. Nordstrom said in January of 2021 that it was ""supporting the important work of nonprofit organizations,"" including the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation. Amazon announced in 2020 that it was donating $10 million ""to organizations that are working to bring about social justice and improve the lives of Black and African Americans,"" including BLM. While Ben & Jerry’s noted in 2020 that it supported the BLM movement years before Floyd’s death and declared, ""Today, we want to be even more clear about the urgent need to take concrete steps to dismantle white supremacy in all its forms."" 'WOKE' RETAILERS WHO ASKED CONGRESS FOR HELP AMID SMASH-AND-GRABS SUPPORTED LEFT-WING POLICE REFORMS Nike - along with Converse, Jordan Brand and Michael Jordan - announced in 2020 it would donate a combined $140 over 10 years to organizations such as the National Urban League and Equal Justice Initiative. Apple launched a $100 million program called the Racial Equity and Justice Initiative in June of 2020, which pledged support to various groups including working with EJI. Facebook pledged support to groups fighting racial inequality just days after Floyd’s death, including EJI, as did Ulta Beauty. In 2020, Target announced a $10 million commitment to ""advancing social justice,"" including donations to the National Urban League. The Equal Justice Initiative and National Urban League did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment when confronted with the FBI data on Black murders and experts arguing the defund movement contributed to the spike. Black Lives Matter’s press team has not responded to repeated requests for comment on the data and experts’ arguments. The national organization, which was co-founded by a self-described ""trained Marxist,"" has come under intense scrutiny in recent months as questions were raised about leadership’s financial dealings. Amazon announced in February of this year that it suspended the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation from its charity platform for failing to disclose where tens of millions of dollars were allocated. Just last week, former diversity leader under the Donald Trump administration Bruce LeVell wrote an op-ed slamming corporations for their ""huge miscalculation"" in backing the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation. ""Unfortunately, BLMGNF has intimidated the leaders of some of America’s largest corporations into paying fealty to its harmful and deceptive narrative,"" LeVell wrote in the Tennessee Star on Thursday. ""Rather than challenging the Marxist provocateurs at BLMGNF, corporate leaders have prostrated themselves and even donated shareholder resources to a cause that is intrinsically opposed to free markets, individual liberties, law and order, and everything else that allows American businesses to thrive.""",Business/Fox News,Companies that loudly supported BLM fall silent when confronted with skyrocketing Black murders,https://news.yahoo.com/companies-loudly-supported-blm-fall-060327006.html
4/26/2022,"A ride safety expert believes ""someone killed"" the teenager who died after falling off an amusement park ride in Florida and believes charges should be filed in the teen's death. Tyre Sampson, 14, fell to his death from the Orlando FreeFall ride at ICON Park in Orlando, Florida, March 24. An operating manual for the Orlando FreeFall ride says the maximum passenger weight is just over 286 pounds. Sampson, who lived in Missouri, was 6 feet, 5 inches tall and reportedly weighed 360 pounds. Ken Martin, an amusement park ride safety analyst and consultant, told Fox News Digital he believes the Orlando FreeFall incident is ""criminal,"" and says ""somebody killed Mr. Tyre Sampson."" ""I'm sorry. With all these circumstances, all these incidents that occurred, it's criminal. Somebody killed Mr. Tyre Sampson,"" Martin said. ORLANDO FREEFALL: FLORIDA LAWMAKER CALLS FOR 'LOOPHOLE' IN LAW TO BE CLOSED AFTER TEENAGER DIED ON RIDE Martin suggets a grand jury be formed with input from people within the industry, saying that somebody should be charged for Sampson's death. Martin said the ride's operator should have seen that the shoulder harness was not in the right spot, adding that ""multiple causes"" led to the incident. ""Once Mr. Sampson got on the ride, the ride operator should have come around, attempted to pull the shoulder harness over him and lock it,"" Martin said. ""We all saw that. We know that the shoulder restraint did not come down where it was supposed to be and that, you know, is an issue."" ORLANDO FREEFALL: FLORIDA LAW 'LOOPHOLE' MAY HAVE LEFT TEEN RIDER IN DEATH TRAP: EXPERT An accident report filled out by an employee states that the seat harness was in a locked position after Tyre fell out. ""FreeFall was coming … down the tower. When the magnets engaged, the patron came out of the seat,"" an employee wrote in the report. ""Harness was still in a down and locked position when the ride stopped."" Martin said that a uniform code for amusement parks is needed, specifically for signage alerting passengers of limitations and safety requirements for a specific ride before entering. Current Florida law allows a manufacturer to decide what goes in — and what stays out — of passenger limitation signs. FLORIDA FREEFALL TRAGEDY: STATE AGENCY HIRES FORENSIC ENGINEER TO INVESTIGATE TEEN'S AMUSEMENT PARK DEATH The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services released its commissioned engineering report performed by Quest Engineering last week, which states that a ""proximity sensor"" for the harness being used by Sampson was ""manually loosened,"" meaning Sampson wasn't properly secured in his seat. Nikki Fried, Florida commissioner of agriculture and consumer services, said during a press conference last week that ""maladjustments"" were made to the seat's proximity sensor that allowed a safety light to illuminate, allowing Sampson to ride even though he was not ""properly secured in the seat."" Surveillance camera capture suspect shooting New York police officer before being killed by FBI agent. ""These maladjustments allowed the safety lights to illuminate – improperly satisfying the ride's electronic safety mechanisms — that allowed the ride to operate even though Mr. Sampson was not properly secured in the seat,"" Fried said. ""The report confirms that manual adjustments had been made to the sensor for the seat in question that allowed the harness' restraint opening to be almost double that of the normal restraints opening range."" FLORIDA FREEFALL TRAGEDY: AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE AT CENTER OF TEEN'S DEADLY FALL WAS BUILT IN DECEMBER Samson's harness had a proximity sensor that ""was manually loosened, adjusted and tightened to allow a restraint opening of near seven inches,"" according to the report. Normally, the range is around three inches, according to the report. ""Orlando Slingshot has fully cooperated with the state during the initial phase of its investigation, and we will continue to do so until it has officially concluded,"" Trevor Arnold, an attorney representing operator Orlando Slingshot, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""All protocols, procedures and safety measures provided to us by the manufacturer of the ride were followed. Today’s report suggests a full review of the ride’s design, safety, operation, restraint mechanisms and history – which, of course, we welcome. We look forward to working with the Florida legislature to implement change in the industry, as the safety of our patrons is always our top priority."" FLORIDA FREEFALL TEEN DEATH: RIDE SAFETY EXPERT HARNESS 'WAS NOT ON CORRECTLY' The ride has been closed since Sampson's death March 24. Depending on the outcome of the department's investigation, it could be closed for good, Fried said during a previous press conference.

4/26/2022,"By Andrew Chung and Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to block an elite Virginia public high school's admissions policy - designed to increase its racial and socioeconomic diversity - that was challenged by a group that said the rules discriminated against Asian Americans who make up the majority of its student body. The justices denied a request by the group, Coalition for TJ, to reinstate a federal judge's February ruling that stopped Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria from using the recently devised admissions policy. Three conservative justices on the nine-member court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, said in the brief court order that they would have granted the request. The case is the latest front in a legal battle in the United States over school admissions policies involving or affecting the racial composition of campuses. The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had put Judge Claude Hilton's February ruling striking down the high school's admissions policy on hold while litigation over the admissions policy's legality moved forward. The Supreme Court is due later this year to hear cases involving Harvard University and the University of North Carolina that give its conservative majority a chance to end affirmative action policies used by universities to increase enrollment of Black and Hispanic students. Thomas Jefferson is a magnet school with a selective admissions policy that has had chronic underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic students. The school board adopted a new admissions process that ended a standardized testing requirement and guaranteed seats for the top students from each public middle school in the surrounding area. Coalition for TJ, represented by the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, sued the school board last year, arguing that the new admissions policy discriminated against Asian American students.

4/26/2022,"Hours from the California coast, surfers are hoping one of the next spots where they can catch a wave is in the desert. At least four large surf lagoons are proposed for the region around Palm Springs, which is more commonly known for art festivals, mountain hikes and golf, and has no natural waves in sight. But some environmentalists and residents say it isn't water-wise to build large resorts in one of the driest spots in California during one of its driest periods in recent memory. They contend water in the massive surf pools will evaporate quickly in the desert heat, wasting a precious resource, while proponents argue the waves will boost tourism, ramp up recreation and use less water than ever-popular golf courses. “Is that their best use of the limited water resources in these climate-driven drought times, is golf courses and surf spots?” said Conner Everts, executive director of the Southern California Watershed Alliance. “It’s like a fantasy. It’s like Dubai.” California is going through a relentless drought, worsened by climate change, and its nearly 40 million residents have faced repeated calls in recent years to conserve water. The greater Palm Springs area sits atop a groundwater aquifer but receives remarkably little rainfall and relies on water from the State Water Project, which is running below capacity, and the Colorado River, a critical U.S. water supplier that is overtaxed. Local water district officials say there’s enough water in a 20-year plan to support the new wave pools and resorts. The proposals, which range from private, luxury communities to a public wave park, come as surfing soars in popularity in the United States. It became an Olympic sport last year, and industry experts forecast its continued growth as travel recovers following pandemic shutdowns and amid a rise in inland surf parks, according to San Jose-California-based Global Industry Analysts Inc. Cheyne Magnusson, a pro surfer who is revamping a Palm Springs water park and adding a wave pool, is counting on that. He said the area is ideal because so many die-hard surfers live within driving distance and waves can be unreliable at the beach. It's also a popular vacation spot, he said, and beginners might want to try surfing in a safe environment. “A lot of people have a day off today, and they really want to go surfing. I can guarantee they are going to get a good wave, and they're going to get a lot of them,” said Magnusson, who helped develop a wave park in landlocked Waco, Texas. Magnusson's project is under construction, and two others are approved. In nearby La Quinta, a proposed 400-acre (160-hectare) development around a half-mile-long (0.8-kilometer) wave basin faces opposition from homeowners who moved to the area in search of a quiet retirement community. They say the proposed Coral Mountain development will draw noisy surf festivals and ruin stargazing with its glaring lights. And they're concerned the pool's anticipated annual use of 120 acre-feet of water — in addition to the water used in the development's 600 homes, hotel and retail outlets — will deplete community water supplies. In 2016, one acre-foot was enough water for between three and four California households for a year, according to the nonprofit Water Education Foundation. “With the evaporation and the wind and everything that is going to happen...,” said Alena Callimanis, a member of the group La Quinta Residents for Responsible Development, “the optics of this are just crazy.” But John Gamlin, president of CM Wave Development, noted the wave basin will use eight to 10 times less water than a golf course, and golf course already has been approved for the site. He said many local backyard swimming pools use drinking water, but the basin will use non-potable water treated in an onsite filtration plant. “At the end of the day we’re confident that the Coral Mountain project will be among the most responsible water users in the Valley,” Gamlin said in an email, adding that residential areas and open spaces, which account for most the project’s outdoor water use, will also use non-potable water. The Coachella Valley Water District, which serves much of the region, said whether to build projects is up to local officials, but the water is there. While the groundwater basin's storage hit a low in 2009, supplies have since improved through replenishment efforts and conservation, said Lorraine Garcia, a district spokesperson. Critics, however, note the district has replenished the groundwater with imported water sources, and these are limited. State officials recently said water agencies will receive 5% of what they requested this year beyond what's needed for critical activities such as drinking and bathing in what has been the driest start to a California year in at least a century. The conditions come amid a tourism boom in greater Palm Springs, which became a travel destination over a century ago when residents sought out the hot, dry climate believing it was good for their health. In the past decade, more younger visitors have come for music and art festivals, said Scott White, president of Visit Greater Palm Springs. In the summer months, the temperature often exceeds 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 C). “To me, the surf parks just make natural sense,” White said. Desert resident and surfer Dave Hilts said he’d like to try out the wave pools for extra practice — though he'd still drive to the beach regularly to surf. He started the Coachella Valley Surf Club to give kids from low-income inland families a chance to surf and is working with a teacher who began a surf club at her desert high school. “It is going to bring a lot of new people into surfing that could never surf before,” he said. That growth, however, worries Ruth Langridge, a senior researcher at University of California, Santa Cruz focused on water law and policy. She said she's long been wary of large-scale development in the desert because of the water demand — from pools or otherwise. “You can fallow an agricultural area, but you can’t fallow a city once you build it,” Langridge said. “There’s a real concern about development in places where there isn’t going to be sufficient water.”",U.S./Associated Press,Surge of desert surf parks stirs questions in dry California,https://news.yahoo.com/surge-desert-surf-parks-stirs-164354950.html
