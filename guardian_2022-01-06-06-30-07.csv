1/6/2022,"“Hospitals in the north of England are incredibly busy now, in particular because of Omicron. At the hospital where I work we’ve gone from 26 Covid inpatients on Boxing Day to 104 now. Unlike previous waves of Covid, only four people are being cared for in ICU, whereas in previous waves we were maxed out at 20 people in ICU. That’s good from the patients’ point of view. But it does stress the rest of the system, including the bit of the system I work in – acute medicine.  That’s because the system sort of sludges up because of the infection control procedures we have to operate to keep patients safe, and keep Covid and non-Covid patients separated. Those are particularly necessary just now, given how easily Omicron is spread. Covid patients need to be kept in single rooms as far as possible or isolated in areas for them, which can reduce the number of beds for other patients to go into. Do we have enough single rooms for them all? No, not at all. And if a non-Covid inpatient in a four-bedded bay tests positive for it then you can lose the other three beds, because segregation is so important. If there aren’t enough beds for other patients then you cannot get patients in to have an elective procedure, because urgent patients have filled up the elective beds. That means that we can’t get as many patients in for elective procedures as we would like. The numbers of patients we are treating now – both Covid and non-Covid – is quite incredible. Our acute medicine team is staffed to look after 45 patients but this morning we had 62. Ten of those 62 have got Covid and the others have a mixture of all the medical conditions that land people in hospital – pneumonias, strokes, heart attacks, liver disease. My colleagues on the respiratory wards are the same. They’re staffed for 45 and have got 58. Covid is affecting all the acute specialties. We’ve got more non-Covid patients than we’ve ever been looking at before in the first week of January, and we’ve got Covid on top of that. It’s not the worst year ever, but it’s on a par with that. This is my fourth wave of Covid. Staff are mentally tired from making so many decisions all the time without a break. But this time myself and colleagues aren’t thinking ‘here we go again’. It’s more ‘we have to do this, we will look after these people, it’s something we have to do’. No one’s happy. No one’s enjoying it. But it’s sort of heads down and do our utmost for these people. You do always feel a bit of anxiety, though, coming in every morning to see how many patients are waiting for you in A&E, who haven’t got a bed. How long have they been there? Omicron-driven staff sickness is not affecting my hospital too badly. We’ve had some junior doctors off, but only a few consultants, and nursing-wise we are coping. But I know that parts of other hospitals in the north have been really ravaged, decimated, because of horrendous staff shortages. You know an NHS trust is in trouble when they’re sending out group texts saying ‘can anybody come in and do a few hours?’ Loads of NHS staff up and down the country will be getting those messages now from their workforce department. They are messages to doctors and nurses saying basically ‘please can anyone spare a few hours to come in and help?’ They’re seeking help in all the frontline departments – A&E, medical admissions, surgical admission and respiratory medicine. They’re the ones that are really busy and need extra staff. Are people answering the call? Mostly people are now just too tired. Some answer and do come in. Maybe they’ve got a few days off and choose to come in, at whatever risk to themselves. But I talk to people who say: ‘Yeah, I got the text, but I’m just too tired. My choice is either doing the extra hours or doing my shift tomorrow. And I’ll stick with my shift tomorrow’.” * Dr Scriven is a former president of the Society for Acute Medicine, which represents doctors who specialise in acute medicine and look after patients who do not need surgery, including many who are Covid+",News/World news,‘Covid is affecting all of acute care – so the system sludges up’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/covid-is-affecting-all-of-acute-care-so-the-system-sludges-up
1/6/2022,"Millions of patients will suffer worsening quality of care unless ministers take immediate action to alleviate the staffing crisis engulfing the NHS, health chiefs have warned. The NHS Confederation, which represents the whole healthcare system, is tonight calling for a range of new measures to be implemented in the NHS in England to help overstretched hospitals and struggling ambulance, mental health, community, GP and social care services cope with “widespread” shortages of medics and health workers.  Tens of thousands of medical students should be deployed on to wards and other healthcare settings, NHS and social care staff must be granted priority access to lateral flow and PCR tests, and the self-isolation period should be reviewed to see if it can be slashed from 10 days to five, as has happened in the US and France, it said. The call came as growing numbers of operations are being cancelled, with more than 20 NHS trusts declaring an “internal critical incident” in recent days as they struggle to cope with the intense Covid pressure. It emerged on Wednesday that at least four more NHS trusts have taken that step, the highest form of alert any hospital can issue, as had the entire NHS in Norfolk. NHS staff absences have now spiralled to double what they normally would be at this time of year, and 17,276 people are in hospital in the UK with Covid – up 58% in a week – as Omicron continues to put “enormous strain” on every part of the health service, the NHS Confederation added. The absence of tens of thousands of staff is already having a “detrimental” impact on the ability of the NHS to provide healthcare, it warned, and said that, without further measures, the staffing crisis “threatens the quality of patient care”. Given the worsening situation, there should also be “explicit acknowledgment” from the national regulators that clinical tasks “might need to be allocated in ways which would not normally be recognised as best practice”, the NHS Confederation said. Matthew Taylor, its chief executive, told the Guardian that in the last 24 hours hospital bosses had become “extremely concerned” about the widening ratio of staff to patients. Boris Johnson insisted on Wednesday he was right not to take any further action. The prime minister told MPs the cabinet had agreed to keep the existing plan B restrictions and ease travel testing rules. He also confirmed plans being implemented across the UK to end the requirement for confirmatory PCR tests for asymptomatic people who test positive using a lateral flow device (LFD). An estimated 3.7 million people in the UK had Covid in the week ending 31 December, the highest number since comparable figures began in autumn 2020, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. In England one in 15 people in private households had Covid-19, according to ONS estimates. The level is one in 10 in London. A further 194,747 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases were recorded in the UK as of 9am on Wednesday, while 334 more deaths were recorded – although this figure includes a backlog of hospital data from England since 1 January. “It’s clear that we are facing a staffing crisis in the NHS, with a number of hospitals telling us they have around 10% of their staff in self-isolation or on sick leave for other reasons,” Taylor told the Guardian. “This is pushing up the ratio of staff to patients to levels hospitals are extremely concerned about. “The prime minister’s attempts to reassure the public that the NHS is not being overwhelmed will not chime with the experience of staff working in some parts of the NHS. The government now needs to do all it can to mobilise more staff and other resources for the NHS to get through this extremely challenging period.” While he welcomed Johnson’s announcement that 100,000 critical workers will get direct access to testing from next week, the move “does not go far enough”, Taylor said, and NHS, social care and other key workers should also have “priority access” to tests. He said there was “merit” in reviewing the self-isolation period “to see if the evidence supports a halving of the period to five days”. “We also need other short-term measures, including deploying medical students on wards and taking other steps to cover rota gaps,” he added. All of Greater Manchester’s 17 hospitals have postponed non-urgent surgery. Its healthcare system will not necessarily be able to “ride out” the wave of Omicron infections, the mayor, Andy Burnham, said, with the number of Covid patients in the region’s hospitals almost tripling in the past two weeks, from 346 people to 1,020. Cara Charles-Banks, the chief executive of the Royal United Hospitals Bath trust, one of those to declare an internal critical incident, said it had done so on New Year’s Eve “due to ongoing pressures caused by both Covid and non-Covid patients, sickness among our staff and availability of beds.” University Hospitals Dorset, which runs acute hospitals in Bournemouth and Poole, is preparing to cancel some routine operations after also declaring a critical incident. On Wednesday Poole hospital had only four free beds while Bournemouth had 25. The same level of sickness absence prompted West Suffolk hospital to join the lengthening list of trusts declaring an incident. Both the acute trusts which provide care to people in Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire also declared an internal critical incident over the bank holiday weekend. The chief executive of one trust in the north of England said it has had to scale back non-urgent surgery after the number of Covid inpatients it is treating soared by 80% since Christmas Eve. “We are doing priority one and priority two surgical cases, with others having to be cancelled,” the chief executive told the Guardian. Their trust is also redeploying staff because 10% of frontline personnel are off sick. “The NHS runs hot all of the time so it doesn’t have the reserve for extraordinary events. Something has to give and, as in previous waves, it will be the care that can be delayed and it will be the goodwill and potentially the wellbeing of staff.”",News/World news,"Ministers must act now on NHS staffing crisis, health chiefs warn",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/ministers-must-act-now-on-nhs-staffing-crisis-health-chiefs-warn

1/6/2022,"Uefa would welcome a bid for the 2028 European Championship from the UK and Republic of Ireland after hopes of bringing the 2030 World Cup there began to fade. The English Football Association is undertaking a feasibility study into a World Cup bid after receiving £2.8m of funding from the UK government. But while a final decision has not been taken, senior figures in the organisation believe any bid is unlikely to succeed.  The Guardian understands the Scottish FA is also uncertain over making a commitment to the 2030 project after proposed funding for the refurbishment of Hampden Park as part of the deal was not forthcoming from Whitehall. The Conservative party made a 2030 bid part of its 2019 election manifesto and last summer Boris Johnson said it was “the right time” to “bring football home”. The pledge was made alongside a commitment to put £550m into the game in the UK, with £50m released last year. A World Cup bid is likely to face several challenges, however, not least the prospect of a strong rival European candidacy in the form of a joint bid from Spain and Portugal, and a shared South American offering on the centenary of the first World Cup in Uruguay. Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, has said he wants to back only one European bid. In a failed bid to secure the 2018 World Cup the English FA received only two votes in 2010 and although the process now gives a vote to each of the 211 members of the Fifa congress, a UK and Ireland vote is again likely to struggle to reach widespread support. An alternative European Championship bid has therefore been gaining traction inside the five associations and relations with Uefa are strong despite the unrest at the Euro 2020 final last year. Ceferin told the Times that the incident “could have happened anywhere,” calling London “a great hub” for hosting a major sporting event. Uefa recently announced that a one-off match between Italy, the European champions, and Argentina, the Copa América winners, would take place at Wembley in June. At the 2028 European Championship the number of competing teams could be expanded to 32, with the facilities offered by the five nations likely unrivalled by alternative bidders. Any proposal to host the 2030 World Cup must be submitted to the Fifa Council before a meeting of the Congress on 31 March. The English FA did not comment on the possibility of not proceeding but referred to a previous joint statement about the feasibility study which said: “Staging a Fifa World Cup would provide an incredible opportunity to deliver tangible benefits for our nations. If a decision is made to bid for the event, we look forward to presenting our hosting proposals to Fifa and the wider global football community.”",Sport/Football,UK and Ireland may favour 2028 Euros bid over 2030 World Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/05/uk-and-ireland-may-favour-2028-euros-bid-over-2030-world-cup
