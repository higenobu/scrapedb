2/23/2022,"What to make of the situation in Eastern Europe? Russia has massed forces on the Ukrainian border, and recognized two adjacent Ukrainian provinces – both with ethnic Russian population majorities – as independent. The US has matched this bellicosity with saber rattling of its own, although the Biden Administration has made it clear that it will oppose Russian moves with economic sanctions rather than force. The result: a geopolitical mess that is threatening stability from Moscow to Washington and all points in between. Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has added some fuel to investor concerns, making public its stance on market fortunes should an open conflict – or harsh sanctions against Russia – take effect. In either of those cases, the firm sees the S&P 500 index losing another 6% in the immediate aftermath. Such a loss would come on top of the ~10% drop the index has already seen this year. When markets and futures are uncertain, and volatility is high, the logical portfolio move is into high-yield dividend payers. These are the classic defensive plays, giving investors a dual path toward returns, from both the share appreciation and the dividend payments. Bearing this in mind, we used the TipRanks' database to zero-in on two stocks that are showing high dividend yields – on the order of 8% or more. Each stock also holds a Strong Buy consensus rating; let’s see what makes them so attractive to Wall Street’s analysts. KKR Real Estate Finance Trust (KREF) It’s no surprise to find a REIT on a list of dividend champs – these companies, which buy, own, lease, and manage a variety of real properties, have long been known for their high-yield dividends. KKR, which operates primarily in 9 states (New York, California, Texas, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Colorado, Illinois, and Florida) has a real estate portfolio composed mostly (over 98%) of senior loans. The company’s property investments are mainly in multifamily dwellings and commercial office space, although there are also significant investments in life sciences properties and the hospitality sector. Earlier this month, KKR reported its 4Q and full-year results for 2021. The company reported that its investment portfolio was valued at $6.8 billion as of the end of 2021, and that it had $6.7 billion in financing capacity. KKR has $41 billion worth of real estate assets under management, an average loan size of $131 million – and best of all, 100% of all loans are described as ‘performing.’ For the full year, the company had 58 cents per share in distributable earnings. That last is a key point, since distributable earnings fund the dividend. On February 1, the company declared a common stock dividend of 40.625 cents. This annualizes to $1.625 per common share, for a yield of 8%. Covering KREF for BTIG, analyst Tim Hayes writes: “KREF has $900M of loans either closed or in the process of closing (most of which are multifamily), which we expect to drive net growth in 1Q22 and put the portfolio in a position to benefit from higher rates by late 1Q22/early 2Q22. Credit performance remained strong in 4Q21, with 100% of the loan portfolio performing, and management provided positive updates on watchlist credits (one of which repaid in full subsequent to quarter-end). Shares currently offer an 8.1% yield — an attractive spread to other fixed-income securities, in our opinion, given the low-risk profile of KREF's portfolio.” Based on the above, Hayes gives KREF a Buy rating, and his $23.50 price target indicates confidence in 12% upside by the end of this year. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~20% potential total return profile. (To watch Hayes’ track record, click here) The analyst consensus on KREF shares is a Strong Buy and it is unanimous, based on 3 positive reviews set in recent weeks. The stock is selling for $20.87, with an average price target of $23; this gives it a potential upside of ~10%. (See KREF stock analysis on TipRanks) Ellington Financial (EFC) And now we’ll turn to another REIT, Ellington Financial. This company takes a broad approach to the REIT field; instead of focusing on just one type of asset, it invests in multiple types of real properties and related securities. Ellington’s portfolio includes equity investments, mortgage-backed securities, and both commercial and residential mortgage loans. Ellington reports its Q4 results on February 23, but it’s worth looking back briefly at the previous quarter to get a feel for the company’s performance. In 3Q21, EFC reported $47.7 million at the top line, up 18% year-over-year, and core EPS of 46 cents. While the Q3 EPS had fallen 5 cents from the previous quarter, it was still enough to fund the monthly dividend. At 15 cents per common share, the dividend comes to 45 cents per quarter, and yields an impressive 10.4%. The company most recent dividend declaration, made on February 7, keeps the payment at the current level and will be paid out on March 25. Analyst Trevor Cranston, writing from JMP Securities, describes Ellington as a near-perfect defensive stock, writing: “We believe that Ellington Financial has consistently demonstrated its ability to generate best-in-class risk-adjusted returns among the residential mortgage REIT group, which in our view is largely attributable to the company’s outstanding protection of book value that has allowed it to generate positive economic returns every year since its founding, including in turbulent years such as 2008 and 2020..."" ""As a result of EFC’s consistent protection of its capital base, we view the company’s long-term risk-adjusted return prospects to be among the best in the mortgage REIT universe and believe the company continues to be a most attractive investment opportunity for long-term dividend-oriented investors,” Cranston added. These comments support Cranston’s Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, while his $20 price target indicates room for an upside of 16% this year. (To watch Cranston’s track record, click here) Judging by the consensus breakdown, opinions are anything but mixed. With 3 Buys and no Holds or Sells assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that Ellington is a Strong Buy. At $19.50, the average price target implies ~14% upside potential from current levels.

2/23/2022,"The adherents of the YOLO movement are a young bunch of diehard optimists believing in a single stock and its future performance, pitching in all the chips they have, while hoping for the best. The meme phenomenon has spread far and wide beyond the obscure dark and not-so-dark humor online boards into the financial market, with crypto meme coin tickers taking up the precious characters of Tweets posted by some prominent investors like Elon Musk. But it has recently overspilled into the conventional financial industry of Wall Street, taking on the form of the YOLO movement. This bizarre phenomenon has seen stocks being pumped beyond even the most optimistic prices by online message boards in an almost coordinated tidal wave that swept across the booming market through 2020 and 2021. With over 80% of investors in YOLO stocks being born in the late 1990s, their overconfidence in continued market growth is staggering, allowing them to take on leverage in the form of credits and debts to start investing in selected stocks. And though there is no actual asset class that could be termed YOLO, it pertains to companies that have posted immense gains and generated headlines during the pandemic lockdown period. Among the most notable examples over 2020 to 2021 are AMC Entertainment (AMC), which skyrocketed by over 2,000% in just under a year, and GameStop (GME)– up 5,232% in the past year. Others in the league are Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBY) with 328% gains, Blackberry (BB) – 113% year-to-date, and others. It all started in early 2021 with GameStop Corp. (GME), which saw its stocks boosted by a group of Reddit users who started investing in it and attracted others to do so. The price soared tenfold from $4 in 2020 to $350 in early 2021. And though stocks eventually took a nosedive to $40 by February of 2021, the GME saga allowed some investors to make millions in short positions on its traction in under a few weeks. Needless to say, a legend was born that took on a life of its own and spread like wildfire, feeding on the hype frenzy and the trusting nature of YOLO stock investors. In fact, stocks with considerable short interest attract droves of buyers. In turn, the short-sellers have to start covering their positions by buying back the shares that they had previously borrowed and sold. Such a rush results in massive artificial demand fueled by message board posts, pushing prices up. Youth is oftentimes described as a disease of inexperience. And rightly so, considering the young age of most investors in YOLO stocks. Such inexperience in true market dynamics is the reason why the strategy is extremely risky, as most investors in one-off stocks hyped by message boards have never seen a bearish market, nor have they any clue of what a market crash looks like. Considering that, and the fact that many of them are investing borrowed funds, their life savings, or even their mom-&-pops’ money, is painting out an eerie picture of the potential consequences of what a sudden market crash or shakeup could result in. Past the fun and excitement of YOLO investing lies the harsh reality that only a meager portion of quick in-&-out investors rake in millions on the strategy. The risks far outweigh the benefits, as the odds of losing all are roughly the same as making some. Intuition and message board posts from users pursuing their own interests are far from ideal investment consultants. When taking on the murky path of YOLO investing, one must never forget about portfolio diversification — a pillar of investment management that most young investors simply disregard. Apart from offering some interaction with a community of concurring investors that may vanish as quickly as the investment in hyped stocks, YOLO is not a sound long-term investment strategy. The mere fact that YOLO stocks were chronic underperformers is a clear indicator that their price spikes are doomed to be grounded the moment the hype wears out. However, if one is eager to try out YOLO investing, the first step would be to select the proper stocks. Reddit channels like Wallstreetbets are the go-to venue, where heated discussions and real-time updates can shed light on potential unicorns and gems. Doing some proper research is also vital, making sure that selected companies have high short interest and available call options, so essential for leveraged investments and bets on positive price traction. YOLO is a fad, a fleeting phenomenon that is certainly not for the average or inexperienced investor. Such stocks are best suited for professional traders with leverage to spend, while novice or entry-capital market players should opt for lower-risk instruments like growth stocks, value stocks, dividend stocks, and large-cap stocks of major companies. Considering that a great many YOLO investors entered the market out of boredom during the first lockdowns, or after being chatted into it by friends and message board users, the risks they bear with every cent injected are immense. YOLO is more like gambling with borrowed money, where the chances are teetering on the edge of the blade either way. Far worse is the fact that YOLO stocks serve the experienced investor and the lucky few, attracting droves of fresh liquidity providers by splaying a handful of success stories as the norm of future stock performance for all involved. With less experience and even less money than previous generations, YOLO investors are playing naked with fire.

2/23/2022,"By Tom Sims FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Allianz has dismissed two asset managers who oversaw a group of investment funds that collapsed after racking up massive losses when the spread of coronavirus triggered wild market swings, according to regulatory filings. The downfall of the $15 billion Structured Alpha funds has landed the German insurance company in hot water with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission, which are both investigating what went wrong. The funds were run by portfolio manager Greg Tournant, who had been with Allianz Global Investors since 2002, according to a profile that used to be on Allianz's website. ""(Tournant) was discharged for violation of firm policies designed to ensure compliance with industry regulations and standards relating to the preparation and provision of client communications,"" according to a filing on Dec. 13 by the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Reuters reported in October that the DOJ was looking into possible misconduct by managers of the Structured Alpha funds and the misrepresentation of risk to investors. Tournant did not immediately respond to a LinkedIn message seeking comment and has not responded to multiple previous efforts by Reuters to contact him. Allianz declined to comment. A second Allianz employee, Stephen Bond-Nelson, was ""discharged for violation of firm compliance policies"", according to a separate filing. Reuters was unable to reach Bond-Nelson for comment. Investors in the funds, which were predominantly U.S. public pension funds, have sued Allianz for a total of $6 billion in damages, though settlements have now been reached with some. The Allianz funds used complex options strategies to generate returns but when the coronavirus pandemic sent stock markets into a tailspin in February and March 2020, they plummeted in value, in some cases by 80% or more. In their lawsuits, investors alleged Allianz had strayed from its stated investment strategy of hedging to limit potential losses. The funds catered in particular to normally conservative U.S. pension funds, including those for labourers in Alaska, teachers in Arkansas and subway workers in New York. Last week, Allianz announced a 3.7 billion euro ($4.2 billion) provision to deal with the fallout, pushing the company into a fourth-quarter loss and resulting in a cut in pay for its chief executive and other board members. In a 2016 video reviewed by Reuters, Tournant likened Structured Alpha's strategy to insurance. ""Our strategies are not race cars looking to speed their way to high returns. They're four-wheel drive vehicles designed to tackle rough terrain,"" he said in separate marketing material.
