5/9/2022,"In 1950s Paris, Régine Zylberberg, a barmaid, cloakroom assistant and occasional seller of bras in the local market, had an idea that would transform the city’s nightlife and make her the darling of the international jet set. Fed up with customers at the famous Whisky-à-Go-Go club repeatedly playing the same songs on the jukebox, and remarking that the sound of “couples snogging in the corners” between records killed the atmosphere, she installed two turntables for continuous music. It was the start of a career as a nightclub owner for the woman who would become known simply as Régine and that would see her credited as creating le discothèque. Régine, nicknamed Queen of the Night, has died aged 92. From her first club in Paris’s Latin Quarter, Chez Régine, established in 1956, her empire would eventually stretch to more than 20 establishments entertaining the world’s beau monde: the rich; the famous; the aristocratic, including royals, from Buenos Aires to Monte Carlo via Kuala Lumpur, Cairo and Los Angeles. Her clientele was eclectic but almost exclusively wealthy, powerful and well connected, among them Andy Warhol, Brigitte Bardot, the Rothschilds, the Kennedys, Liza Minnelli, Truman Capote, Marlene Dietrich, Henry Miller, Richard Nixon, the future president Georges Pompidou, the mobster John Gotti and Salvador Dalí. She dyed her hair flame red and attracted diverse lovers: the actors Robert Mitchum, Warren Beatty, Gene Kelly, Steve McQueen and Omar Sharif, and singer Jacques Brel, as well as sporting stars and alpinists Jean-Claude Killy and Maurice Herzog, the Spanish matador El Cordobés and the Swedish tennis champion Björn Borg. “I do love champions,” she told French television. Dancing was her passion: “If you can’t dance, you can’t make love,” she would say, and she famously taught the Duke of Windsor to do the twist. The rich and famous went to Régine’s, where drinks were sold by the bottle, to see and be seen, but their exclusivity was founded on illusion; a “Full” sign would be put outside each of her clubs even as they opened, a hype that created the demand that saw everyone, however privileged, queue to enter. “After a certain hour [of the night], it’s sometimes difficult to distinguish a princess from a prostitute. And one doesn’t exclude the other,” she wrote in her memoirs. Only London failed to fall for Régine’s charms. Her two attempts to open clubs in the city crashed. “The English have no style,” she claimed afterwards. By the early 80s, Régine also had her own line of perfume, but as times and tastes changed, the clubs closed, and bad investments diminished her fortune. For those who knew her traumatic history, and she made no secret of it, Régine’s self-professed workaholism and search for recognition and respect were rooted in trying to compensate for a childhood blighted by an alcoholic father, an absent mother and the Nazis. Régina (she became Régine later) was born in Anderlecht, Belgium, to Tauba Rodstein and Joseph Zylberberg, both Polish Ashkenazi Jews. Her parents had lived for eight years in Argentina and moved to Paris when Joseph, a drinker and gambler, lost the family boulangerie in a poker game. Rodstein soon gave up and returned to Argentina, leaving Régina and her brother, Maurice, in their largely absent father’s care. During the Nazi occupation of France, the children went into hiding in a series of foster homes, including a convent in Aix-en-Provence where Régina was beaten by other girls for being Jewish. At the age of 14, she was working at a refuge for the elderly in Lyon where she fell in love with the owners’ son, Claude, nephew of Bernard Schonberg, the chief rabbi in the city. In 1944 he was on his way to the synagogue to discuss marrying her when he was arrested by the Nazis and dispatched to the concentration camps, where he died. Shortly afterwards, aged 16, Régina married Leon Rotcajg, with whom she had a son, Lionel, but they divorced four years later. In postwar Paris, Régine worked in the café-bar-brasserie in the 20th arrondissement established by her father, where she also learned to cook. After opening Chez Régine, in France she also became well known as a singer and occasional actor, starring in films by the directors Claude Lelouch and Claude Zidi and recording a number of albums. Having sold all her nightclubs by the late 2000s, Régine declared herself “ruined”. However, she went on to harness her connections for charitable causes, including the fight against drug abuse, wrote three volumes of a memoir and returned to singing. In 2015, she set off for her first concert tour, performing just some of the 300 songs she claimed had been written for her during her lifetime. “For a long time, songs were just a hobby. But now I realise that the stage has been the most important part of my life,” she said. Asked by a French journalist why she had not retained her family name, and went by Régine, she responded: “Can you imagine someone saying ‘tonight, we’ll meet at the Régina Zylberberg…’? By the time you say it, the night is already over.” In a profile published in New York magazine in 1977, Régine said her penchant for throwing spectacular events was to make up for all the birthday parties she never had. “One by one, I have filled the dreams of my childhood,” she told the magazine. She married Roger Choukroun, a computer engineer, in 1969 and divorced him in 2004, but despite her marriages and many lovers, Régine would always describe Claude Schonberg as her “first and only true love”. Her son, Lionel, died in 2006. She is survived by a granddaughter, Daphné.

5/9/2022,"Sinn Féin hailed its first victory in a Northern Ireland assembly election as a defining moment for the British-controlled region and called for a debate on a united Ireland. The party’s president, Mary Lou McDonald, had a simple message for unionists on Saturday, telling them: “Don’t be scared, the future is bright for us all.” The party has deliberately played down its long-term goal for a united Ireland, but unionists will have been spooked by previous statements that they would like to see a border poll on Irish unification within five to 10 years. Categorically no. That power lies only with the Northern Ireland secretary. Brandon Lewis on Sunday categorically ruled out such a poll and his successors are unlikely to order a referendum with such profound implications. As Sinn Féin’s deputy leader, Michelle O’Neill, pointed out on the BBC’s leadership debate before the election, the Brexit vote demonstrated the perils of referendums called without adequate preparation. The last such exercise in Ireland legalised abortion and is widely considered a model for controversial polls. It took years of preparation including citizens’ assemblies and proposed legislation agreed by parliament in advance so voters knew the precise consequence of their ballot. The Good Friday agreement allows for a poll at some point but avoids defining the circumstances precisely other than it is the British government who decides not parties in Northern Ireland. It states: “If at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland, the Secretary of State shall make an Order in Council enabling a border poll”. The agreement does not define what it means by a majority, but experts say a number of metrics would have to be used, not just an election result. A group of academics led by Alan Renwick, the deputy director of University College London’s constitution unit, spent two years studying a potential border poll. Their 259-page report asks all the key questions about how one could come about and how it would be designed. They conclude that there would have to be majority support for a united Ireland, probably between 51% and 55%, for some time before the secretary of state would have to exercise their “mandatory duty”. Alan Whysall, also of the UCL constitution unit, points out that a united Ireland was a distant prospect in 1998 and the wording in the agreement is marred by “serious gaps and ambiguities in the framework” for a poll. UCL suggests six sources of evidence for a majority: election results, opinion polls, qualitative research, a vote in Stormont, seats won at elections and demographic data. It is widely assumed, rightly or wrongly, that those of Catholic heritage would support a united Ireland while those of a Protestant persuasion would fight for the status quo. The latest census results out this summer could show that Catholics outnumber Protestants for the first time. Peter Shirlow, the director of the University of Liverpool’s institute of Irish studies, believes however that a new cohort could emerge as Northern Ireland’s peace settlement matures. He calls them “secular unionists” from both faith heritages who want to Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. Debates south of the border assume that parliament would sit in Dublin if a united Ireland were ever to come to pass, but UCL found this would be fraught with problems. Its report outlines four constitutional options: Devolved institutions retained in Northern Ireland but with sovereignty transferred from London to Dublin. A single central legislature, likely to be in Dublin, but unionists would be likely to see this as a hostile takeover. “This model has been the historic preference of many Irish republicans, constitutional or otherwise. But some would see this approach [as came across in our evidence sessions] as being at odds with the consensus-building aspect of the 1998 agreement,” UCL says. A federal state. This model “would avoid some of the governance complications of lopsided devolution. But a two-unit federation would be imbalanced,” says UCL, which looked at institutions based around city regions or centres of population. A confederation of two states – a Northern Ireland independent of the UK and Ireland. UCL found this “would less clearly meet the prescription of unity laid down by the 1998 agreement”. The post-Brexit status of Northern Ireland in or out of the EU could also require a referendum.",News/UK news,United Ireland: why is it not on cards despite Sinn Féin success?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/08/united-ireland-how-might-it-happen-and-what-would-it-be-like
5/9/2022,"Unusually, the announcement that 29-year-old Scottish actor Ncuti Gatwa is to be the new Time Lord seemed to set non-Doctor Who fans alight as much – or even more – than avid followers. After the beloved Sex Education star (co-star Gillian Anderson described him as a “natural on camera”) was named as the 14th doctor on Sunday, compliments rolled in from both sides of the Atlantic. “I don’t even care about Doctor Who but I will 100 percent watch anything with Ncuti Gatwa in it,” wrote London PR agency founder Kasimiira Kontio. Meanwhile, US writer Meecham Whitson Meriweather tweeted: “Me googling ‘what is Doctor Who about’ after hearing Ncuti Gatwa is gonna be playing them.” But until fairly recently, he was a relative unknown. Born in Nyarugenge, Rwanda and raised in Scotland, where his family moved when he was two during the 1994 genocide, he has said he was “an easy target” at secondary school in Edinburgh, where there were few black families, but that he “always had faith in my charisma.” The family lived in university accommodation while Gatwa’s father studied for a PhD in philosophy and theology. But his father was forced leave the family and move to Cameroon because he was unable to get work as an academic in the UK, which Gatwa has described as “an amazing sacrifice”. Gatwa went to church and bible study growing up as his father was a minister. He still has faith, he has said, but that he is “not the biggest fan of organised religion”. The idea that he might become an actor first came when he was 17 and his drama teacher complimented him on his talent. After training at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, he moved to London where he struggled to make ends meet. Before landing his breakthrough role in the Netflix show Sex Education in 2018, he spent time homeless after burning through his savings. “Being a 25-year-old man with no money or job affected my sense of self-worth,” he wrote in the Big Issue. “Rejection became unbearable. Auditions weren’t just acting jobs, they were lifelines.” While working as a temp at Harrods and sharing a friend’s bed, he lost weight because he could not afford to eat. He also suffered from depression but did not tell friends because he did not want to be a “burden”. “I would get compliments for looking so presentable. When I lost weight due to eating only one meal a day, people told me how lean and healthy I looked,” he wrote. He started his onscreen career as an extra in the 2014 sitcom Bob Servant. Two years later he played Demetrius in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, in Emma Rice’s first show at the Globe. In perhaps an indicator of his stratospheric rise to fame after the release of the first season of Sex Education, he had less than 1,000 followers on Instagram at the beginning of 2019. Now, after his breakout turn as Eric Effiong, a gay teenager from a British Nigerian family, in the show, his following is 2.6 million. He was awarded best actor at the Scottish Baftas the following year and at tonight’s Bafta TV awards he is nominated for best male performance in a comedy programme. He has spoken about people calling his identity into question because of his Scottish accent. “People really cannot understand the concept of a black boy in a tracksuit in London being from Scotland,” he has told the Independent. “People think I’m taking the piss. I’m like, ‘Stop taking my Scottishness away. You don’t define me.’” His parents are his role models, who he said have inspired his work ethic and a sense of responsibility. “I’ve not completed the spot yet, but do things with intention and it’s not just you … you’re doing this for other people that are looking up to you and your future kids,” he told Teen Vogue.",Arts/Television & radio,Doctor who?

5/9/2022,"The US has unveiled a new layer of sanctions on Russia, targeting services, Russia’s propaganda machine and its defence industry on the eve of Vladimir Putin’s planned Victory Day parade. The new measures were announced as leaders from the G7 group of industrialised democracies held a virtual summit with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a show of solidarity. They are primarily intended to close loopholes in the existing sanctions and to tighten the noose around the Russian economy by another few notches. The new sanctions include: *A ban on sales of US services to Russia, like accountancy and management consultancy *No more US advertising or sales of broadcasting equipment to three Kremlin-controlled television stations *Technology export bans including industrial engines, bulldozers and other items that can be used by Russian defence factories *Visa restrictions on another 2,600 Russian and Belarusian individuals, including military officials, and executives from Sberbank and Gazprombank In imposing a ban on services the US is falling into line with the UK, which made a similar announcement last week. The two countries provide the overwhelming bulk of services like accountancy and management consultancy to Russian corporations. The Biden administration sees US service providers as potential tools Russia could use to sidestep the punitive measures already imposed. “They’ve been asked by Russian companies to help them figure out how to reformulate their business strategies in the wake of sanctions, in some cases how to get around these sanctions, or in the case of accountants how to hide some of their wealth, and we’re shutting that down,” a senior administration official said. Like the UK, the restrictive measures do not apply to lawyers, but the US official said that could change, and that Washington and London are coordinating their moves in that respect. “We made a judgment at least for now, that if there was a desire to seek due process through a US lawyer, we would allow that to continue,” the official said. “But we’re reevaluating the breadth of these services sanctions every day, and depending on how we see behavior change over time, we can certainly broaden the sanctions.” The new media sanctions will target three Kremlin-controlled propaganda outlets: Channel One, Russia-1 and NTV. American companies will no longer be allowed to sell equipment like video cameras or microphones to them, and US advertising on their channels will be banned. Last year, US companies bought $300m in advertising in the Russian market. “A lot of these advertisers have announced since the invasion that they’re going to cut their business activity with these stations, but we want to make sure that decision endures and just send a broader signal that US companies should not be in the business of funding Russian propaganda,” senior a senior administration official briefing the press ahead of the announcement. The new technology export bans on industrial items such as heavy engines and bulldozers are intended to have an impact on Russian war efforts by hitting the supply chain for defence manufacturers. The US claims that Russia two major Russian tank plants, Uralvagonzavod Corporation and Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant, have already been forced to halt production due to a lack of foreign components. The 2,600 new visa restrictions on individuals include military officials and Russian proxies deemed to have played a part in the invasion and there will be a new visa policy which would apply automatically to military or proxy officials involved in human rights abuses. The targeted sanctions will also hit eight executives from Sberbank, Russian’s largest financial institution, and 27 from Gazprombank, owned by Russia’s giant gas industry. Until now Gazprombank has been left untouched because of its role in facilitating European purchases of Russian natural gas. “This is not a full block. We’re not freezing the assets of Gazprom bank or prohibiting any transaction with Gazprombank,” the senior administration official said. “What we’re signaling is that Gazprombank is not a safe haven, so we’re sanctioning some of their top business executives, people who sit at the top of the organization, to create a chilling effect.”",News/US news,"US unveils new sanctions on Russia, targeting services, media and defense industry",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/08/us-unveils-new-sanctions-on-russia

Rutten, 59, a former Netherlands midfielder who has managed a string of clubs over the past 20 years or so, including Twente, Schalke, PSV Eindhoven, Vitesse and Feyenoord, preferred to stay in his native Netherlands to be close to his family. Rutten is set to return to PSV, where he has been lined up as an assistant to Ruud Van Nistelrooy, who will take over as the club’s manager next season. “Erik ten Hag has asked me to be his assistant at Manchester United, I said no,” Rutten told Dutch TV. “Everyone makes his own choices in life.

5/9/2022,"It is not just significantly enhanced revenue-raising powers that local government needs (Editorial, 2 May), but fundamental financial reform. Here, our local authority has lost more than £500m of government funding since 2010. Councils in poor areas are obliged to seek ever increasing sums from poor people. With little government help to councils, no wonder budgets are extremely tight for the provision of services. The Westminster politicians leading the Labour party should be following the lead of Scottish Labour and calling for the abolition of the council tax and its replacement with a fairer local levy linked to property values and ability to pay. Why should the NHS be funded out of general taxation, but social care by local taxpayers, many struggling to make ends meet? Why should those resident in lower band housing have to subsidise those in grander properties? Councils need to have access to funding out of national taxation, and powers to enable them to deliver sorely needed social housing for rent.Phil TateChester  In your leader you write about top-heavy government structures. In Cumbria next year it’s going to get worse. Cumbria county council is to be abolished and the six district councils are to be replaced by two unitary authorities. Perhaps that is a good thing, but the government has dictated the regional boundaries, ignoring local views. Worse still is the drastic reduction in the number of councillors. Maybe we do have too many and some reduction is justifiable. Here in Stanwix (north Carlisle) we have three city councillors, one of whom is also a county councillor. But in the new authority there’s going to be just one. I suppose it’s all about saving money, not about improving democracy. Local government is a nuisance as far as Westminster is concerned. Forty years ago I lived in the Netherlands and I cannot help but note the stability of government structures there compared with the way there has been continuous tinkering here since 1974, all about giving central government more power at the expense of local democracy.Ian K WatsonCarlisle  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
