4/27/2022,"A £25m “fraud squad” is to be launched after MPs criticised the government’s failure to crack down on criminals who stole billions of pounds of taxpayers’ cash through Covid support schemes. Announcing the creation of the Public Sector Fraud Authority (PFSA) on Wednesday, the Treasury said it would double the government’s counter-fraud efforts, adding to work of the £100m taxpayer protection taskforce (TPT) launched more than a year ago. The PSFA, which is to start operating by July, will be run through the Cabinet Office and given the £25m budget to “crack down on criminal gangs who rip off the taxpayer”. It is believed that about £4.9bn was lost to fraud through the bounceback loan scheme, while another £5.7bn is estimated to have been lost from fraud and error within the furlough and self-employment programmes. The Treasury could not immediately confirm how many people would be recruited to the PSFA but said it would be staffed by an “elite team” of data experts and economic crime investigators tasked with recovering public funds. They will also be in charge of spotting “suspicious companies and people” trying to gain access to government contracts, and review existing Whitehall programmes to try to detect any vulnerabilities to fraud. The announcement came hours after parliament’s influential public accounts committee called for more resources to counter fraud efforts, after criticising the government for its “unacceptable” failure to recover taxpayer cash. MPs on the committee said the government was “complacent in preventing fraud”, in particular through bounceback loans, which were distributed by high street lenders but 100% guaranteed by the state – leaving taxpayers to foot the bill. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said on Wednesday: “People are rightly furious that fraudsters took advantage of our vital Covid support schemes, and we are acting to make sure they pay the price.” The Treasury said further details about the PFSA would be released after the new efficiencies and value for money committee, which is chaired by the chancellor, meets for the first time on Wednesday afternoon. The PSFA is part of the government’s latest efforts to show it is cracking down on fraud, and comes more than a year after it committed £100m to setting up the TPT, which is run by 1,200 HMRC staff and has a target to recover up to £1.5bn by the end of this financial year. The government says it has also tapped the Cabinet Office counter-fraud function for support and given another £6m in funds to the national investigation service (Natis) to tackle fraud and crime related to Covid support schemes. Natis and the National Crime Agency had together made about 66 arrests in relation to bounceback loan scheme fraud as of early March.",News/Business,Sunak launches squad to recover billions from Covid fraudsters,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/sunak-launches-squad-recover-billions-covid-fraudsters-public-sector-fraud-authority-taxpayers
4/27/2022,"A council in England has paid £60,000 a week – the equivalent of £3.12m a year – for a “wholly unsuitable” children’s home placement for an autistic teenager with a mild learning disability. The judge hearing the girl’s case was so appalled that he ordered the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, to explain the government’s position on what he called a “national crisis” – the severe shortage of secure placements for vulnerable children with complex needs. The case, first reported by the open justice court of protection project, involves a girl who spent at least five months alone in the locked annexe of a children’s home. She was cared for by six dedicated members of staff while her local authority tried and failed to find a home that would better meet her needs. The council told the court of protection it had approached several hundred providers nationwide but no one was willing to take her. The girl had been in care since June 2019, after her mother could not cope, and had lived in at least 15 different settings since then. The court heard she had a history of violence towards her carers, and last year was hospitalised after being continuously awake and “experiencing mania” for 72 hours, during which she gained access to the roof of her care home and threatened to kill herself. She threw boiling water from a kettle over staff caring for her, and threw nail polish remover into the eyes of a carer, saying she wanted to blind them. She armed herself with knives and parts from a broken bed and threatened staff. She set fire to a tea towel, saying she wanted to burn the house down. Though she did not need medical care and was assessed as not meeting the criteria for detention under the Mental Health Act 1983, she ended up in a hospital bed in accident and emergency because the children’s home would not take her back. A judge authorised her deprivation of liberty in a secure placement, but the only one the council could find cost £60,000 a week. A barrister for the local authority described it “a staggering cost, which has come about through there being a complete lack of alternative resources”, the open justice court of protection project reported. The placement was “wholly unsuitable” and left her isolated, the barrister acknowledged. Keeping the girl and her carers safe has been a constant battle, the court heard. Last year the teenager was arrested after she attacked a staff member. In the police cell she hit her head and pushed her acrylic fingernails up her nose to create blood, which she spat around the cell. Mr Justice Poole, who has dealt with the case several times, said in a hearing: “This case is reflective of a national crisis. Support from central government is needed.” He gave permission for relevant case papers to be disclosed to NHS England and to the education secretary “with a view they each are invited to provide information and witness statements to the court”. Zahawi wrote to the court through the local authority involved to put forward his position, the Guardian understands. The Department for Education did not answer when asked what the education secretary’s position was. A spokesperson said: “All children and young people deserve to grow up in stable, loving homes. We commissioned an independent review of children’s social care, which will set out to radically reform the system, and are working hard to raise standards for children in care while it continues. We are also taking forward urgent reforms to address pressures in the sector, including providing £259m to maintain capacity and expand provision in secure and open children’s homes.” The Guardian understands that the girl has recently moved to a more suitable placement in rented accommodation, with the same team of carers, and that the care cost has reduced to £33,000 a week (£1.71m a year). Rachel de Souza, the children’s commissioner for England, said the girl was suffering as a result of a “systemic failure to plan cohesively and locally for children in care”. She added: “Unfortunately, I am seeing more and more cases like this. I appreciate the shock generated at the amount of money involved here, though the problem runs far deeper than the money involved. This is about children’s lives being repeatedly and continuously turned upside down when they are most vulnerable because we have not invested in quality places for them to live. “What I want to see is a total re-think about how we provide this type of care. Now, the system relies on councils buying beds in children’s homes, some of which are good, some of which are not. The child is then expected to fit in with the home and evicted if their needs change. This puts the onus on the child. “I want to see more locally run homes, which are flexible enough in their approach that children can stay put even as their needs change.”",News/Law,Council paid £3m a year for ‘wholly unsuitable’ place for vulnerable girl ,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/27/council-paid-3m-a-year-for-wholly-unsuitable-place-for-vulnerable-girl
4/27/2022,"Retail sales in the UK have slumped in April as hard-pressed households reined in their spending amid the soaring cost of living, according to the latest industry snapshot. The figures from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) found retailers suffered a rapid decline in sales volumes, in a month when consumers faced soaring gas and electricity bills, record fuel prices and a sharp increase in the cost of the weekly shop. In a sign that the worst squeeze for household disposable income since the 1950s is starting to affect consumer spending, the data showed a particularly sharp fall for clothing and specialist food and drink shops. Motor traders said sales were poor in April, having been good in March, while retailers warned that sales volumes were likely to continue declining in May, albeit at a more modest pace. Compiled from a survey of 108 companies, including 51 retailers, in the weeks immediately after Rishi Sunak’s spring statement, the CBI survey showed that sales volumes were considered to be poor for the time of year in April. The headline retail sales balance on the lobby group’s distributive trades survey fell to -35 in April from +9 in March, significantly below the average of -3 expected in a Reuters poll of economists. The CBI said some of the drop in sales reflected consumers switching back to spending more on services – such as eating out in pubs and restaurants and travelling on holiday – after the easing of Covid restrictions. Retail sales had soared in lockdown while other opportunities to spend were limited. However, it also warned that soaring prices were hitting consumers’ spending power. Households faced a record energy bill increase of 54% at the start of April, in a month when petrol and diesel rose to a record high amid the war in Ukraine and as the government increased taxes on workers. “It follows a sharp drop in March, and suggests that the current decline in real incomes, due to the jump in inflation and the higher tax burden, will weigh on retail sales,” said Gabriella Dickens, a senior UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. Annual inflation reached 7% in March, the highest rate since 1992. Economists have warned that inflation, which acts as a gauge for the rising cost of living, could hit 10% this year. Martin Sartorius, an economist at the CBI, said high inflation meant the cost of living crisis was going nowhere soon. “To combat these challenges, the government will need to keep a close eye on support for vulnerable households and businesses struggling with higher energy prices. Meanwhile, going for growth must continue to be the government’s primary domestic focus, as increasing productivity growth is the only sustainable route to raise living standards,” he said.",News/Business,UK retail sales slump as soaring energy prices hit households,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/uk-retail-sales-slump-as-soaring-energy-prices-hit-households-cbi
4/27/2022,"Priti Patel’s plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda is facing its first legal challenge after a charity instructed lawyers to demand the disclosure of documents because of fears the policy is contrary to international law. In a pre-action letter to the Home Office, which is expected to lead to a judicial review claim, the solicitors Leigh Day stated that the charity Freedom from Torture “has serious concerns about the lawfulness of the policy”. It has requested “disclosure of information regarding the policy”, including documents outlining it, risk assessments and the memorandum of understanding signed by the UK and Rwandan governments. Under the deal, signed off by Patel and praised by Boris Johnson as a way of saving hundreds of people from trafficking, those arriving by small boat across the Channel would be flown with a one-way ticket to Rwanda. Britain has promised Rwanda an initial £120m as part of an “economic transformation and integration fund” but the UK will be paying for operational costs too. However, no details have been released by the Home Office. The home secretary issued a rare ministerial direction to overrule concerns of civil servants about whether the scheme would deliver value for money. Patel has been the subject of significant judicial criticism for repeatedly failing to disclose key policy documents, including those relating to the confiscation of phones from newly arrived refugees and contentious plans to task Border Force to “push back” boats carrying refugees across the Channel. Freedom from Torture, a London-based charity, was part of a successful challenge to stop the pushback of boats in the Channel. The government officially withdrew those plans on Sunday, just days before a judicial review of the tactic was due to be heard in the high court. A crowdfunding appeal will be launched by the charity to help raise funds to cover the costs of the legal challenge, which it hopes will lead to the Home Office policy being withdrawn. Sonya Sceats, the chief Executive at Freedom from Torture, said: “The outpouring of compassion for those fleeing Ukraine and Afghanistan has shown that the public wants people seeking safety to be welcomed. But instead, this government is planning to ship refugees halfway around the world to Rwanda. We shouldn’t have to resort to legal action for this government to treat refugees with basic human dignity – but here we are again. “This cruel plan is not only deeply immoral and likely unlawful, it would also deny torture survivors and others access to vital trauma services like those provided by Freedom from Torture. Up and down the country, people are beginning to mobilise against this government’s cynical efforts to stoke fear and xenophobia against refugees. This action is one part of a wider fight by the caring public to tell the government that this heartless policy is not in our name.” Fewer than 200 people who came to the UK without authorisation would have been sent to Rwanda last year, analysis of government figures found. The Refugee Council said 172 people could have been sent to the east African country had a deal been in place. It estimates that this year the number is not likely to be much higher. The figures cast doubt on Johnson’s claim that “tens of thousands” of people who have arrived in the UK without authorisation could be given a one-way ticket to Rwanda. A Home Office spokesperson said the agreement requires Rwanda to process claims in accordance with the UN Refugee Convention, ensuring protection from inhuman and degrading treatment. “Our new migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda fully complies with all international and national law. Whilst we expect the Partnership to be challenged in the court, we will defend any legal challenge robustly.”",News/UK news,Priti Patel’s Rwanda asylum seeker plan faces first legal challenge,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/27/priti-patel-faces-legal-challenge-over-rwanda-asylum-seeker-plan
4/27/2022,"The Conservative chief whip is investigating reports that a Tory frontbencher watched pornography on his phone in the Commons chamber, a statement from his office has said. Female Tory MPs met Chris Heaton-Harris on Monday night to complain about sexism in parliament, with one alleging that a male colleague was watching pornography next to them in the House of Commons. The group of about 12 to 14 female MPs shared their experiences of sexist behaviour among Tory male MPs, telling Heaton-Harris that something must be done. They also called for action against three cabinet ministers who are reportedly subject to inquiries about inappropriate sexual behaviour. The MP who raised the issue did not name the male MP but there are reports that he was seen watching porn in both the chamber and a committee meeting. A spokesperson for the whips said: “The chief whip is looking into this matter. This behaviour is wholly unacceptable and action will be taken.” It comes following an outcry about misogyny towards the Labour deputy leader, Angela Rayner, after the Mail on Sunday published claims from a Tory MP that accused her of crossing and uncrossing her legs, like the character played by Sharon Stone in the film Basic Instinct, to distract Boris Johnson at prime minister’s questions. Rayner has hit out at the false claims. Johnson was pressed about whether the Tories were taking sexual harassment seriously by Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, who asked in PMQs on Wednesday whether this was grounds for dismissal. “Of course sexual harassment is intolerable … of course it’s grounds for dismissal,” he said. At the meeting of a group known as the 2022, the female MPs demanded action against sexism in the Conservative party. Theresa May was present for part of the meeting. The Sunday Times reported last weekend that 56 MPs had been referred to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Service over sexual complaints, including three cabinet ministers and two shadow cabinet ministers.",News/Politics,Chief whip investigates reports Tory MP watched porn in House of Commons,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/27/chief-whip-investigates-reports-tory-mp-watched-porn-in-house-of-commons
4/27/2022,"Russian forces have pushed deeper into eastern Ukraine and captured several villages in their offensive to fully control the two provinces of Donbas, Kyiv has said, while to the west there are mounting fears that the war may spill over into neighbouring Moldova. The Ukrainian defence ministry said on Wednesday that Russian forces had pushed Kyiv’s army out of Velyka Komyshuvakha and Zavody, in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, and gained control over Zarichne and Novotoshkivske in Donetsk. The Kremlin said this month it was pulling its forces out from around Kyiv to focus on capturing the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in Donbas, which have been controlled by pro-Russia separatists since 2014. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of the Donetsk region of Donbas, said on the Telegram messaging app on Wednesday that Russian forces “continue to deliberately fire at civilians and to destroy critical infrastructure”. The interior ministry of Moldova’s pro-Russia breakaway region of Transnistria, which borders western Ukraine, said on Wednesday that shots were fired overnight from Ukrainian territory towards a village housing a large Russian ammunition depot. The ministry also said drones were observed over the village, and it claimed they too had been launched from Ukraine. Its statement came after a series of explosions in the unrecognised region that authorities there referred to as terrorist attacks. Russia’s foreign ministry has refused to rule out Transnistria – occupied by Russian forces for decades – being drawn into the war, saying Moscow was “concerned” by the explosions targeting the state security ministry, a radio tower and military unit. It was not clear who is behind the blasts in Transnistria but the attacks gave rise to international alarm that Moldova could be Russia’s next target or that Moscow could try to use the breakwaway region as another launching point to attack Ukraine. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, claimed that Russian “special services” were working to “destabilise the situation in the [Transnistria] region, to threaten Moldova. They show that if Moldova supports Ukraine, there will be certain steps.” The UN and US have expressed alarm but have not yet backed Kyiv’s claim that Moscow was responsible. Meanwhile, blasts were heard on Wednesday in three Russian provinces bordering Ukraine, reports said, and an ammunition depot near Staraya Nelidovka in Belgorod province caught fire. Russia earlier accused Ukraine of attacking a fuel depot in Belgorod but Kyiv has not confirmed responsibility for incidents reported on Russian territory. The Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said it was natural that Russian regions where fuel and weapons were stored were learning about “demilitarisation” – a pointed reference to Moscow’s stated objective for the nine-week-old war in Ukraine, which it calls a special military operation to disarm and “denazify” its neighbour. “If you [Russians] decide to massively attack another country, massively kill everyone there, massively crush peaceful people with tanks, and use warehouses in your regions to enable the killings, then sooner or later the debts will have to be repaid,” Podolyak said. “Karma is a cruel thing.” Russia’s defence ministry said its Kalibr missiles had struck an arms depot in Ukraine’s southern-central Zaporizhzhia region storing “foreign weapons and ammunition supplied to Ukrainian troops by the US and European countries”. The ministry said Russia’s air force destroyed 59 Ukrainian military targets overnight. Petro Andryushchenko, an official in Mariupol, said Russian forces hit the Azovstal steel plant there, where about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters and 1,000 civilians are still holed up, with 35 airstrikes over 24 hours. Zelenskiy has been pleading for heavier firepower to push back the Russian advance in Donbas but western allies are wary of being drawn into an outright war with Russia. With Moscow’s potentially critical eastern offensive under way, however, Washington pledged on Tuesday to move “heaven and earth” to enable Ukraine to win. Germany announced on Tuesday it would send self-propelled anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine, reversing its much-criticised cautious stance on heavy weapon supplies. The UN refugee agency UNHCR has said it expects more than 8 million Ukrainians to eventually flee their country, with nearly 5.3 million having already left, and that $1.85bn will be needed to host them in neighbouring countries.",News/World news,Russian forces capture several villages in push into eastern Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/russia-forces-capture-villages-eastern-ukraine-war
4/27/2022,"Welcome to The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly (and free) cricket newsletter. Here’s an extract from this week’s edition. To receive the full version every Wednesday, just pop your email in below. Roll up! Roll up! The hunt is on for a new head coaches for the England men’s cricket teams. Gary Kirsten, Graham Ford, Simon Katich … Justin Langer, Ricky Ponting – heck maybe even that Aussie guy the Spin saw get ejected from Edgbaston in the early noughties for throwing cooking apples into the crowd while dressed as an alpine milkmaid – will no doubt be polishing up their CVs and swotting up on their ECB values as we speak. They’ll need to clear the diary for the interviews on 9 and 10 May, that’s when it’ll be tracksuits off, suits on and shoulder yokes down for the stroll into Lord’s with their plans for “setting out and then executing short-, medium- and long-term plans for the development of the England team”. Sheesh. Talk about a heavy load. The candidates thinking of throwing their peaked cap in the ring for the England gig might want to have a look into the somewhat turbulent history of the role before they do so, the job is the soufflé of the cricketing world, seemingly simple yet difficult to execute, vulnerable to collapse(s) and more often than not ending in disappointment and failure. Mickey Stewart became the first cricket manager in the mid-80s. Stewart was tasked with the job of bringing “organisation, preparation and discipline” to the England side after years of defeat, ill-discipline and even drug-taking allegations. His tenure lasted six years and is largely deemed a success, despite a fractious relationship with David Gower and the rebel tour of South Africa happening on his watch. Those who played under Stewart praised his man-management, tactics and planning. Graham Gooch later wrote in his autobiography that Stewart was “an anchor for England”. The following decades would see the waters get much choppier. Keith Fletcher, the Gnome of Essex, succeeded Stewart for a three-year reign between 1992 and 1995, a period in which the side went down in five of the seven series they played. In 26 Tests they lost 15, drew six and won a paltry five. Fletcher’s years “running” the side coincided with Ray Illingworth becoming increasingly more powerful as chair of selectors. The no-nonsense former captain of England and Yorkshire ended up with a power of veto over new captain Michael Atherton and he was not afraid to use it, even on the eve of a Test match. Illingworth had a tendency to brief against the team and criticise them in the press, his outspoken and power-monopolising ways soon saw to the end of Fletcher. Illingworth simply swallowed up the team manager role like a basking shark hoovering up plankton. Predictably, it didn’t end well. Illingworth was seen as out of step with the modern game, after further fallouts with the captain and players (he memorably called Graeme Hick “soft-centred” as result of a “molly coddled upbringing”) Illingworth quit after England’s disastrous showing in the 1996 World Cup. David Lloyd took over in 1996, an enthusiastic, popular and fatherly figure who backed his players to the hilt: Lloyd had a strong rapport with his captain, Atherton, a fellow Lancastrian. Bumble’s passion could sometimes bubble over, resulting in high-profile gaffes such as the “We flippin’ murdered ’em” line he delivered after a frustrating drawn Test in Bulawayo against Zimbabwe in 1996. Fallouts with the ECB suits saw the lugubriously vowelled and anecdote-laden Lloyd head for the commentary box. England’s timid group stage exit of their own 1999 World Cup was his final coda as coach, though he had handed in his notice before it began, meaning Alec Stewart’s captaincy was then kiboshed in the blood-letting afterwards. After a summer in which England slipped to the bottom of the Test rankings and new captain Hussain was booed by his own fans after defeat to New Zealand at the Oval, Duncan Fletcher took over, becoming the first overseas head coach. Fletcher reaped the rewards of central contracts and forged strong relationships with his captains, Hussain and Vaughan (but not Flintoff) and created a senior leadership group within the team to impart his message. The Zimbabwean was a meticulous technician (the forward press, anyone?) as well as an astute reader of the game. Forever be-shaded with a perennial blank frown like a polar bear with a migraine, Fletcher was memorably inexpressive on the team balcony whether England were sliding to defeat, squeaking to a win or if Ricky Ponting was giving him a mouthful of expletives. He will forever be remembered for masterminding the 2005 Ashes win even though his legacy was tarnished significantly in the following years, eventually bowing out on the back of an overseas Ashes whitewash and a haphazard, Fredalo-ed 2007 World Cup campaign. Enter Peter Moores, the only man to have held the position twice, with both of his tenures ending in lamentable circumstances. New captain Kevin Pietersen torpedoed both his own and Moores’s jobs in 2009. KP bristled at Moores’ lack of international experience as a player and his “intense” methods of coaching, calling Moores “the woodpecker” and falling out with him on matters from training to selection. The tag of Moores being an analysis obsessed and stats-driven coach proved to be his undoing in his second stint. After England’s creakingly outmoded style of play led to an embarrassing exit from the 2015 World Cup Moores was misquoted as saying that “he’d have to check the data” with regards the reasons for England’s early exit. Moores is said to have heard about his second exit from the role (after Test defeat to West Indies) through his wife who was scrolling on Twitter. In between Moores’ stints Andy Flower took the job and England, with the help of captain Andrew Strauss, to No 1 in the Test rankings, a feat they achieved in the third Test of the 2011 home series against India, who were coached at the time by Flower’s countryman and predecessor, Duncan Fletcher. A first global tournament win, holy grail and hen’s teeth overseas victories in Australia and India were high points in an unprecedented period of success. Flower was gnarly and uncompromising, qualities that cost him in the end, brick-lifting Bavarian training camps are all well and good if the team are winning but the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash finished him off. From 2012-14 the job was split for the first time by red and white-ball formats. After a perceived power struggle between Ashley Giles and the more powerful Flower, the “experiment” was deemed a failure when England were left with orange yolk on their face after 2014 T20 World Cup defeat at the hands of the Netherlands. Trevor Bayliss was hired as a sort of Aussie Mr Miyagi “wax on, take a heavy load off” kind of coach in 2015. Suspicions surrounding his laidback and white-ball focused approach abounded but Bayliss is one of the few in the role to have gone out on his own terms, a drawn (but unregained) Ashes and World Cup win under his arm, along with a Yukka plant and CD of whale noises. Bayliss spent time afterwards as an estate agent, perhaps just to fill up his cup of disdain and ill-will before sliding into another top-level tracksuit and going again. Chris Silverwood, the latest head coach casualty, could have been forgiven for dreaming of a career as a traffic warden as the team bottomed out in the latest Ashes debacle. But a matter of weeks after his sacking he became coach of Sri Lanka instead. What does all this tell us? Well, it rarely ends well for England’s head coach. It doesn’t take long before perceived weaknesses are sniffed out and seized on. Too weak, too stern, too laid back, too intense, too emotional, too sullen, too strict, not strict enough, obsessed with training/data/analysis, not concerned enough with training/data/analysis. Too attacking, too defensive … They meddle too much! They’re too hands off! What do they even do? Those who get the roles will have to do it in their own way, and good luck to them. Look out for the press, the fans, the players, the suits and the opposition. If they don’t get you first then the job will, in the end. It nearly always does.",Sport/Sport,"The Spin | Too weak, too stern, too strict, too lax: a brief history of England coaches",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/27/too-weak-too-stern-too-strict-too-lax-a-brief-history-of-england-cricket-coaches
4/27/2022,"There are at least 1.4 million migrants living in the UK without access to public funds – that means no social security, no temporary accommodation and no access to domestic violence refuges. When the pandemic first hit, through my work at the food bank that I set up with a group of friends, I saw first-hand the vulnerability of people struggling with their immigration status. I knew I had to do something to help undocumented migrants but I wasn’t sure if I was committing a crime by doing so. I decided that people’s dignity was more important than harsh rules at a time of crisis, and I started gathering volunteers and distributing food to a few families. Soon afterwards, I received requests from hundreds of undocumented and vulnerable people desperate for help. Now I’m worried that the cost of living crisis could be about to make things even worse. The users of my service are not only frightened by the virus and the Home Office, but also by hunger. Delivery drivers, families with young children, pregnant women, older people, victims of domestic violence and others working in restaurants are among those forgotten by the system. Many have lost their income and homes, putting them at risk of exploitation. My food bank and others are documented in a collaborative film between the Guardian video team and myself. It was extremely difficult to get undocumented people to speak on camera for fear of the authorities. We filmed Josef, who has been living in London for 19 years and has never been to a doctor because he is undocumented. Josef has asthma and went to a hospital to get the Covid-19 vaccine but was denied because of his immigration status. Josef has been an invaluable part of the team helping many hundreds of families avoid destitution while struggling with his own life. In the film, we speak to Adam, a Deliveroo driver who delivered food to households during the lockdown and who is sadly struggling to make his living as a result of his immigration status. He feels trapped and hopeless about his future. Michel, a young lady who was initially trafficked into the UK for domestic labour when she was a child, told me that she chose to work for the NHS during the first lockdown. She felt a moral obligation to help maintain the cleanliness of the hospital, risking her own life in doing so, yet she feels treated as a second-class citizen for not having the same rights as people holding a British passport. Halfway through filming, I had to make the very difficult decision to close my food bank. A lot of my volunteers had gone back to working in the informal economy. I struggled to find a permanent venue for the project until finding a short-term space provided by a local church. The generosity and kindness of places like that contributed to helping us feed those in need, but demand is slowly increasing, pushing against the limits of what we can provide. Nicole, who runs another food bank, estimates that 80% of her users have no recourse to public funds and she is now getting calls from people asking her to pay for their electricity, something she doesn’t have the funds to do. At the same time, Nicole’s family has also been struggling with their own immigration status, which has pushed them further into debt. Nicole’s cousin Geatan arrived in the UK when he was just 10. He is from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and had to flee the civil war with his family. Like me, he also wanted to be a film-maker but student finance declined his grant application as he had no access to public funds. He told me that he had started feeling different from others when he was in sixth form as he was not allowed to travel abroad with his classmates because of his immigration status. Today, Geathan is 26 and still in the same situation. As you’ll see from our film, the most vulnerable people in society suffer the most in times of hardship. Instead of our government helping those in need in such desperate times, the most vulnerable people have to rely on kindness from strangers and use food banks to get their everyday necessities. While some people will be adjusting to the new normal, for a lot of people nothing about their situation has changed: they continue to stay under the radar and are vulnerable to crisis. Meanwhile, the people who they trust to help them, the people who are operating separately from the authorities, are struggling too.
