3/28/2022,"It was after travelling 6,600 miles and battling through the tropical assault course of the Luzon rainforest that Chris Thorogood set his eyes upon the rare and extraordinary flower that ignited his childhood imagination 30 years ago. Thorogood, 38, last month became the first westerner to see the Rafflesia banaoana – an otherworldly-looking red spotted species that spans half a metre across – in an experience that reduced him to tears. “It’s hard to put into words the feeling,” he said on Sunday. “It’s a combination of the exertion of the trek, which is quite intense, but also a feeling of sharing a moment with something ephemeral, rare, and a striking work of nature that you can’t see anywhere else. It’s a bit of a tear-jerker to sit with something like that.” The Rafflesia banaoana is the rarest and most elusive species of the genus named after Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore. The flowers are found only in the deep rainforests of Luzon island in the Philippines. Thorogood, the deputy director of the Oxford Botanic Garden and Arboretum, describes it as “the world’s most whopping weird plant”. The botanist is quick to point out that although he is the first westerner to set eyes on the Rafflesia, the experience would not have been possible without the work of Pastor Malabrigo Jr and Adriane Tobias, of the University of the Philippines, the only two other botanists to have seen the flower. The trio gained permission to enter the farthest reaches of the rainforest by the indigenous Banao community, who own the land and escorted them to the flower by hacking a trail through the dense and hostile vegetation. By the time they reached the Rafflesia, Thorogood’s arms were covered in blood from leeches and he nursed a plant sting that “felt like someone poured boiling water” on his skin. The two-week expedition was the culmination of years of planning, but its genesis goes back to Thorogood’s childhood bedroom in Chelmsford, Essex. From the age of eight, he would marvel at photographs of alien species of rare flowers in the remotest corners of the planet. “There were these extraordinary photographs of these flowers in the jungle somewhere that seems so remote and inaccessible and alien to me, as a child, having never really travelled very far,” he said. “It’s almost like they were a magnet from the other side of the globe luring me to go and see them. I remember quite clearly as a child being entranced by these photographs in books of these otherworldly botanical enigmas. I think I subconsciously made my plans then that I was going to make it my life’s work to go and see them.” Rafflesias can grow to 1.5 metres across and weigh 10kg, making them the largest flowers on earth. There are 13 species of Rafflesia in the Philippines and they remain something of a mystery in the scientific world. Thorogood, the author of a book titled Weird Plants, said it was vital to understand rare species so they can be better protected. “Two in three of the world’s plant species are threatened with extinction, which is alarming, and we’re losing plant species possibly more quickly than we can describe and discover them,” he said. “We can’t conserve or protect something if we don’t know it exists.” As for his next expedition, Thorogood is remaining tight-lipped: “With 400,000 or so different plants, there’s a bewildering diversity of plants out there. So it’s very difficult to narrow it down to one or two. But there will be plenty of plants lying in wait for me, I’m sure.”",News/Environment,‘A striking work of nature’: the search for a rare flower in the Philippines jungle,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/27/jungle-flower-rafflesia-banaoana-luzon-philippines
3/28/2022,"Joyce Carol Oates’s multitudinous collections are repeatedly subtitled “tales of suspense” or “stories of mystery”. You tend to know what you’re getting with an Oatesian short – a disquieting snapshot of American life on the verge of individual or ideological collapse – and these nine additions to her oeuvre don’t disappoint. The first, Detour, is a classic of its type. A diversion forces a woman down a forest road, she wrecks her car and, looking for help, ends up a befuddled prisoner in an isolated house. The set-up is cliched to the point of being arch, but Oates brilliantly toys with our understanding of a confused mental state. At least there’s some relief at the end of that horror. In Wanting, the rising panic the reader and protagonist feel as she agrees to go to a stranger’s macabre studio is gripping. There’s a similar exploration of the excitement inherent in a reckless act in Intimacy, where a creative writing professor is thrilled and intimidated by a supposed war veteran’s threatening demeanour. The reckoning here is left entirely to our imagination – another typically superb Oates trope. Throughout, she stylishly conveys the sweep of a life; the consequences of experiences, however tiny. The smaller experiments with form are interesting too. In Parole Hearing, California Institution for Women, Chino, CA, she inhabits a fictional disciple of Charles Manson, every sentence beginning “Because”. Miss Golden Dreams 1949, meanwhile, is mischievously written from the perspective of a cloned Marilyn Monroe doll. The collection ends with the title story, in which a woman who has fought off unbearable abuse is pregnant and happy. When her sliding doors moment arrives, a hopeful or heartbreaking future is left open to interpretation. It’s Oates’s work in microcosm; nuanced rather than neat.

3/28/2022,"One must always wear headphones when watching video, take care not to be “a table-hogger”, and one must not – in any circumstance – look askance at a crying baby. Those are the cardinal rules of working from a cafe, according to the etiquette bible Debrett’s. The 253-year-old British institution, which once advised women to avoid using “vulgarisms, flippancy, coarseness, triviality or provocation”, has turned its attention to the modern trend of working from public spaces. In a new guide titled Cafe Rules for Digital Nomads, Liz Wyse, Debrett’s etiquette adviser, explains when it is appropriate to make video calls in a cafe (never) and how often to order food or coffee (at regular intervals). “Cafes need turnover to make a profit, so you must not turn into a table-hogger, who nurses a single cup of coffee while other customers come and go,” intones the official advice. Workers should remember that cafes are a place for people to socialise and chat, so do not glare if you find the noise disturbing: “You must never look askance at your near neighbours because their animated conversation or crying baby is playing havoc with your concentration. That is your problem, not theirs.” Founded in 1769, Debrett’s started as a guide to the British aristocracy but branched out in the mid-1900s to become the unofficial rulebook on “British style, correct form, modern manners”. The rise of hybrid working during the pandemic has had a mixed reaction among cafe owners. Many have welcomed the extra custom but others have banned laptops after 5pm and complained about workers hogging tables without buying many drinks. Last month, Costa Coffee launched a limited trial of soundproof booths with charging points in a number of its stores for customers willing to pay £13 an hour. The trial, in partnership with My Work Booth, is in two stores in Manchester and two in London but will be extended in the coming weeks. For those who have no option but to work amid the clatter and din of a busy cafe, Debrett’s has the final word. “You should avoid video calls or conferences when you are working in a cafe, as you will look unprofessional,” said Wyse. “You don’t want colleagues or clients to get the impression that you are casual about your work commitments. “If circumstances arise where you have no choice and have to join a video call, explain where you are and apologise for your backdrop. When you are not speaking always remember to mute the sound, otherwise you will deafen your colleagues with clattering coffee cups and chattering customers.”",Lifestyle/Money,‘Don’t be a table-hogger’: Debrett’s issues guide for working from a cafe,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/27/dont-be-a-table-hogger-debretts-issues-guide-for-working-from-a-cafe
3/28/2022,"Just how long has the British monarchy been in crisis? This time – after “Megxit”, after Prince Andrew – it was the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s disastrous trip to the Caribbean. What was supposed to be a “charm offensive”, drumming up enthusiasm in the year of the Queen’s platinum jubilee, ended up looking more like a long goodbye, with the headlines spotlighting anti-royal protests, failures to address legacies of slavery, and the news that Jamaica is planning to ditch the Queen as head of state. It may well be time for the royal family to face up to the fact that the sun is setting on those final remnants of the empire that they once embodied – and not a moment too soon. For Britons, it can be easy to forget that the Queen’s realm and territories stretch far beyond these isles. Out of the 54 “independent and equal nations” that make up the Commonwealth of Nations, 15 (including the UK) still count the Queen as their head of state. Becoming a republic doesn’t necessitate surrendering membership of the Commonwealth itself – it simply means a symbolic rejection of British rule. And with Barbados finally taking the leap last year, longstanding debates about republicanism have been reignited in the remaining realms. The issue is just as hotly debated in the likes of Australia (54% of people there would support becoming a republic) as it is in Jamaica, but packing William and Kate off to the Caribbean has inevitably focused minds in that region. Though republican camps in the Caribbean have long cited the impact of colonialism and slavery on the contemporary fortunes of their countries, a new reckoning is afoot, against the backdrop of the global Black Lives Matter movement and renewed conversations about the legacy of empire. Thanks to the attention the royals command, the disintegration of British overseas rule is being documented in real time. The signs weren’t looking good for William and Kate from the outset. The couple’s first official engagement, in Belize, was unceremoniously cancelled after protests from the Q’eqehi Maya people over a land dispute with a charity that William patronises. Heading to Jamaica, they were met with more demonstrations, this time calling on the royals to address the issue of reparations for the several hundred years they directly profited from the slave trade. Government officials backed up the sentiment, with Jamaica’s prime minister, Andrew Holness, informing a solemn William and Kate that the country was “moving on’’ and wanted to be “independent”, seemingly following the example of Barbados. It’s no wonder the royals were gracing Sunday’s front pages in damage-limitation mode, with William offering a half-apology for the tour. As ever, sometimes opening their mouths only make things worse: in a speech given in Kingston last week, Prince William expressed “profound sorrow” for the transatlantic slave trade, but people were quick to point out that he stopped short of an apology or acknowledging the monarchy’s direct interests in slavery. At one point in history, enslaved Black Africans arriving in the Caribbean via the Royal African Company were branded with the initials “DY”, marking them as the property of the then Duke of York . Royal profiting from slavery continued apace – the future William IV even personally argued for the continuation of the trade in the House of Commons in 1799, a move that, according to historian Brooke Newman, helped “delay” abolition for a few more years but “misjudged the mood of the nation” – and damaged the reputation of the royal family as a result. For the royals, the trip has been a sharp lesson in how people in the Commonwealth now perceive Britain and its institutions. As the Jamaican dancehall artist Beenie Man put it during an interview with ITV News: “We are just here, controlled by the British, ruled by the British law when you go in the court. It’s all about the Queen … but what are they doing for Jamaica? They’re not doing anything for us.” The Jamaican writer Ashley Rouen Brown summed up the grounds for resentment succinctly: Jamaicans, he wrote, are “currently the only citizens within the Commonwealth realm that require a visa to visit the land of their head of state”. Meanwhile, requests for financial reparations, in recognition of the impact centuries of plunder had on economic prospects, have been met with egregious responses, like David Cameron’s 2015 offer for Britain to finance a £25m prison to hold Jamaican “criminals” in lieu of compensation for slavery. In Jamaica, republicanism has been part of the political conversation since the 1970s, and there is cross-party support for the move. But now, debate has been replaced by decision. Emancipation is in full swing. It’s no coincidence that it comes as the Queen – who “made the Commonwealth central to her life when she became monarch” – reaches the twilight of her reign. But nor can it be a coincidence that this is all happening after several years of governmental and monarchical misrule in London. The aftermath of the Windrush scandal still leaves a bitter taste. And, albeit on a different scale, it’s worth taking account of some more of Beenie Man’s words: “If Harry was coming, people would react different,” he said. “People are going to meet Harry.” In that sense, the royals really are the authors of their own misfortune. But with or without the Sussexes, there is an air of historical inevitability to all this. So, what happens next? Ahead of Kate and William’s visit, the Windrush campaigner Patrick Vernon said: “If Jamaica decided it did [want to become a republic], there would be a domino effect on the rest of the English-speaking Caribbean.” His words may well be prescient. The royal couple flew into the Bahamas, the last leg of their tour, to be greeted by protests on the ground and opposition from the likes of the Bahamas National Reparations Committee. Belize has announced a constitutional review, and late last year leaders including the St Vincent premier were urging fellow Commonwealth realms to attain republican status. The wheels seem firmly set in motion, with the royals’ open-backed Land Rover left spinning in the sand. This kind of reckoning with reality is long overdue, and, who knows, it may even be a long-term positive for Britain if it helps disabuse our political class of its globe-trotting, Empire 2.0 fantasies. At the very least, now is the time to admit that for many parts of the world, the benefits of sovereign British rule are most heavily felt by the home nation itself. Within our own borders, we may kid ourselves that the monarchy is still a glittering jewel in our crown. But for many people overseas who wish to escape the long shadow of empire and exploitation, the shine has well and truly rubbed off.

3/28/2022,"Drummers have had to learn to live with satirical jokes about their musicianship or aspects of their personalities, but Taylor Hawkins proved that the drummer could be a star in his own right, and also that being a drummer could co-exist happily with being a singer, songwriter and bandleader. Hawkins, who has died suddenly aged 50 while on tour with Foo Fighters in Colombia, had been a member of the group since 1997. His first album with them was There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999), which reached the Top 10 in the US and the UK and brought them their first Grammy award (for best rock album). Hawkins was at the drumkit for seven further Foo Fighters albums, as they established themselves as one the world’s top rock acts drawing devoted hordes of fans internationally. To date they have won 12 Grammys, and their consistently successful albums have topped the US album chart twice and the UK chart five times. Their latest album, Medicine at Midnight, is nominated for three Grammys, with the awards ceremony due on 3 April. In addition to his musicianship, Hawkins brought humour, enthusiasm and personality to the group. As well as singing on the Foo Fighters songs Cold Day in the Sun and Sunday Rain, he would often sing cover versions with the band and was a regular songwriting contributor on their albums. Recent live shows had found him seizing the microphone to step into Freddie Mercury’s shoes – not a job for the faint-hearted – and perform an outsized version of Queen’s Somebody to Love, as he did at his final performance with the band at Lollapalooza Argentina on 20 March. Meanwhile he always threw himself into his work behind the drums with passionate, arm-flailing intensity. His blond hair and athletic frame gave him the air of having just stepped out of the California surf, accentuated by his fondness for sleeveless T-shirts and Bermuda shorts. But he combined showmanship with technical skill, coupled with a knowledge and respect for musical history. He recalled how attending a Queen concert in 1982 was a life-changing experience – “it was the beginning of my obsession with rock’n’roll, and I knew that I wanted to be in a huge rock band”. One of his main inspirations was Queen’s drummer Roger Taylor, alongside the Police’s Stewart Copeland, Phil Collins, U2’s Larry Mullen and Stephen Perkins from Jane’s Addiction. He also picked up some tips from the jazz drummers Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich. Hawkins was born in Fort Worth, Texas, to Terry Hawkins, a businessman, and his wife, Elizabeth Ann. He had two older siblings, Heather and Jason. In 1976 the family moved to Laguna Beach, California, and Hawkins graduated from Laguna Beach high school in 1990. When he was 10 his parents bought him a drum kit, which proved to be a pivotal moment. “I was a fat, chubby, stupid kid who failed at everything and whom nobody liked,” he later recalled. “Then I started playing drums.” His mother was always supportive of his efforts at singing and playing drums. “She was a big supporter and told me I’d make it,” he told the Sydney Morning Herald. “She counteracted Dad’s stony coldness, typical of a 1970s man.” He began performing with local groups, and after being drummer for the progressive rock-influenced outfit Sylvia he joined the backing group for the vocalist Sass Jordan. Then his profile received a major boost when he was recruited to join Alanis Morissette’s band as she toured her 1995 breakthrough album Jagged Little Pill (it sold more than 30m copies worldwide). Hawkins appeared in the video for You Oughta Know, the album’s first single, which helped trigger its meteoric success, and also in the video for You Learn. It was while he was touring with Morissette that Hawkins got to know Dave Grohl, founder of Foo Fighters, since they would often be on the same festival bills. The pair immediately struck up a close rapport on both a personal and musical level, as Grohl described. “Our musical relationship – the foundation of that is our friendship, and that’s why when we jump up on stage and play, we’re so connected, because we’re best friends.” When Foo Fighters needed a drummer in 1997, after William Goldsmith quit during the making of the band’s second album, The Colour and the Shape, Hawkins was the obvious choice. The fact that he also had ambitions as a singer and songwriter meant that he had little hesitation in giving up his job with Morissette. Alongside his Foo Fighters work, Hawkins released three albums with his band, Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders, played cover versions with Chevy Metal, released an album with the Birds of Satan, and had another album due for release in 2022 with NHC, which featured Hawkins alongside Dave Navarro and Chris Chaney from Jane’s Addiction. Hawkins is survived by his wife, Alison, whom he married in 2005, and their children, Oliver, Annabelle and Everleigh.

3/28/2022,"After last year’s Covid-dogged TV ratings disaster, the 2022 Oscars arrive in the grip of a full-blown identity crisis. Will anyone watch, will it be too boring, are they dissing the small fry, too mean, too cuddly, too many hosts, not enough hosts…? It’s safe to say the organisers are walking a tightrope, with TV masters ABC reading the riot act on the one hand, and unsung industry figures furious about being denied their few seconds in the spotlight and planning protests. Added to that are the usual PR shenanigans, with Power of the Dog director Jane Campion coming the most spectacular cropper so far, after copping a load of flak fpr appearing to knock the Williams sisters. It’s also not helping that Los Angeles is in the grip of a new Covid surge with one or two laying part of the blame on Bafta. Local regulations means that the participation of a number of high profile names is in the balance, pending tests. So what do we know? Three main hosts have been “tapped”, as they say: Wanda Sykes, Regina Hall and Amy Schumer (the latter mildly embarrassing herself by pitching they get Volodymyr Zelenskiy on the show via videolink). There’s a whole ton of fancy presenters lined up, including West Side Story star Rachel Zegler who basically had to beg for a slot after no one gave her a ticket. On top of the customary performances from the song nominees (Beyoncé! Billie Eilish! Not Van Morrison, who says he can’t make it because he’s on tour!), the Oscars will see the first ever live version of smash-hit We Don’t Talk About Bruno, which wasn’t actually nominated. And hold on to your hats as two “popular” awards get their first run-out: the Oscars Fan Favorite and the Oscars Cheer Moment. In terms of the wider significance of the show, this might be the moment that the upstart streamers finally break through and dislodge Old Hollywood. The best picture race looks like a straight fight between Apple’s Coda and Netflix’s The Power of the Dog; the trad studios’ best hopes are West Side Story and Belfast. (The latter in particular seems to have been steadily going back in the betting since its barnstorming audience award triumph at the Toronto film festival, which often presages a best picture win. But maybe not this year.) In the US: The E! channel gets things underway with its Brunch at the Oscars at 11:00 PT/14:00 ET, then moves to Live From the Red Carpet show at 14:00 PT/17:00 ET.

3/28/2022,"Plans that would enable clubs to qualify for the Champions League based on historic performance and not their league position are back on the table, a year after the collapse of the European Super League. Members of the European Club Association, an organisation which includes 10 Premier League sides, are to lobby Uefa to allow two teams to qualify for Europe’s elite club competition based in part on their coefficient, a metric calculated according to continental performance over the five previous seasons. The Guardian understands that the proposals would see clubs who finish outside Champions League places in their domestic leagues, but qualify for the Europa League or win a domestic cup, compete for two places which would then be decided by coefficient ranking. The proposals have been discussed within the Club Competitions Committee working group, which sees senior members of the ECA work on competition reforms with Uefa. They are also likely to be raised at the organisation’s General Assembly in Vienna this week. Allowing clubs to qualify for the Champions League via club coefficient were part of original plans to expand the competition approved by Uefa last year. At the time they were seen as allowing big clubs to guarantee a place in the competition even if they failed to qualify on merit by league position. Following the collapse of the European Super League and public concerns over preserving ‘sporting integrity’, Uefa said the reforms could be adjusted. Speaking earlier this month at the Financial Times Business of Football summit, the governing body’s president, Alexander Ceferin, said that while the means of qualification for two additional sides had not been confirmed, it would mean “more places for smaller and mainly mid-sized leagues”. Any reversion to using a coefficient as basis for qualification, however, is likely to benefit clubs from bigger European Leagues, where there are more qualifying spots to start with and where teams tend to dominate the latter stages of tournaments. A club in a big league can even see its own coefficient boosted if other clubs in their division are successful in Europe. The proposals will prove divisive. The European Leagues organisation which represents domestic competitions across the continent is against qualification by coefficient, as are a number of fan organisations. One leading fan group, Football Supporters’ Europe, this weekend launched an initiative called Win it on the Pitch that calls for the reform of EU law which, among other things, would ensure “qualification to Europe via domestic success”. The issue remains a sore point within the Premier League, too. While the league’s biggest clubs are ECA members, including all six of the breakaway Super League sides, other clubs are increasingly vocal about competitive imbalance within the division, one they see as being furthered by Uefa reforms. Last year’s plans for a Super League were led by the then-chairman of the ECA, Andrea Agnelli, who subsequently resigned from his role. Juventus, where Agnelli is chairperson, have also left the organisation, alongside fellow Super League clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona, with the chairman of the ECA now Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi. Sources close to the ECA confirmed that discussions with Uefa over Champions League reform remained ongoing, but insisted any final decision would be made by the governing body.
