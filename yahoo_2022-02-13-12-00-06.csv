2/13/2022,"The recent reports that Donald Trump“never stopped ripping” up documents while he was president, flushed some down the toilet, and absconded with at least 15 boxes of White House papers (including pages marked as classified) when he left office, made Hillary Clinton tip her new, hilarious hat while trolling her old rival. Clinton highlighted the latest merchandise being offered by her nonprofit Onward Together — a cap sporting the phrase “But Her Emails” — in an Instagram post and tweet on Friday. They’re described as “black unstructured dad hats” that are union-made in America. The most important element is the phrase, which is frequently used to slam back at the cascade of Trump’s continually emerging eye-popping behavior while president. Yet he acted positively outraged while campaigning against Clinton at her history of sending emails on a private service while she was secretary of state in the Obama administration. He still has his fans chanting “Lock her up!” because of the emails. She was cleared of wrongdoing after extensive investigations. Clinton wrote on Instagram that the new hats were being offered “just in time for Galentine’s Day, and the news that Trump was flushing documents down White House toilets.” (Galentine’s Day is a made-up holiday popularized in NBC’s “Parks and Recreation.”) The black versions of the hats were already sold out on Saturday. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) tried to humiliate Clinton over the hats, responding in a tweet: “This is just sad.” But Twitter critics weren’t having it. This is just sad. https://t.co/beeZGDfJ0N — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) February 11, 2022 Sadder. pic.twitter.com/2IrVtQa1Ur — JON (@JonInPGH) February 11, 2022 pic.twitter.com/AUsuCSFyYY — AvalancheGirl (@ColleenL66) February 11, 2022 We agree. Flushing classified documents down the toilet shouldn't even be in the same conversation as deleting Nana's quiche recipe email, but here we are — individual 1 (@FredDibean) February 12, 2022 So you are saying flushing documents is ok, but wearing a hat is sad.

2/13/2022,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico said on Saturday the United States has decided to temporarily suspend avocado shipments on security grounds from the western state of Michoacan, a major producing region that has faced chronic problems with gang violence. Mexico's Agriculture Ministry said U.S. health authorities had notified Mexico of the decision after one of its officials, who was carrying out inspection work in the city of Uruapan, Michoacan, received a threatening call to their cell phone. The ministry said the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is carrying out an investigation to assess the threat, and to determine what measures are needed to guarantee the safety of its personnel working in Michoacan. The news is a setback to the administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, with United States the top consumer of Mexican avocados, snapping up many thousands of tonnes each year to make guacamole, a favorite Super Bowl snack. The Super Bowl will take place on Sunday. The announcement was made hours after the U.S. government expressed dismay about violence against journalists https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-violence-usa/u-s-embassy-dismayed-over-violence-against-journalists-in-mexico-idUSKBN2KH0OG in Mexico, following the latest in a series of killings of reporters. Michoacan has long been one of the most troubled states in Mexico and Lopez Obrador has struggled to impose himself against gangs that have kept violence near record levels on his watch. The state has frequently been convulsed by turf wars between gangs, in particular the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), one of the most powerful outfits in the country. Earlier this week, the Mexican Army said it had entered a part of Michoacan regarded by security experts as a stronghold of the CJNG, and restored order in 43 localities. In the past six weeks, Michoacan exported over 135,000 tonnes of avocado to the United States, the ministry said.
