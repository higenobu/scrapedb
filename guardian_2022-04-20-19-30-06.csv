Every branch of Waterstones, Foyles, Blackwell’s, Hatchards and Hodges Figgis will have a curated Read for Ukraine table at the front of the shop, featuring a mix of fiction and nonfiction titles donated by publishers and their authors. Among the 27 books in the initial selection are Mr Loverman by Bernadine Evaristo, The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, Summer by Ali Smith and A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian by Marina Lewycka. Oxfam’s Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal will receive 100% of the proceeds from sales of the books. In addition, Penguin Random House and Waterstones are offering a special charity edition of Andrey Kurkov’s Death and the Penguin, a tragicomic novel about an obituary writer and his pet penguin, Misha. Kurkov has written a new introduction, placing the novel in the context of the Ukrainian conflict. Every sale of the book, which is priced at £12.99, will include a donation of £10. James Daunt, managing director of Waterstones, said: “We are very proud as booksellers to be able to work with authors and publishers to make this collective contribution to help the humanitarian effort to support those affected by the crisis in Ukraine. We thank the authors and publishers for their generosity. This is a compelling selection of books, with every penny from their sale going to support this urgent work.” Waterstones said the campaign is likely to continue for some months, with the selection of books being regularly refreshed in collaboration with publishers. Danny Sriskandarajah, chief executive of Oxfam GB, said: “We are incredibly grateful to everyone involved in the Read for Ukraine initiative for their support to people fleeing devastating conflict in Ukraine. As humanitarian needs continue to grow, the money raised will help Oxfam and partner organisations in eastern Europe to provide vital support to people who have already lost so much. With so many people displaced by the conflict, we are also working to set up safe travel routes for refugees and advocating for governments to honour their international commitments to the rights of all refugees.” The full list of Read for Ukraine books can be viewed and purchased online.",Arts/Books,Waterstones launches scheme to raise £1m for Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/20/waterstones-launches-scheme-to-raise-1m-for-ukraine-oxfam-appeal
4/20/2022,"Muttering often accompanies Kutluğ Ataman’s work, though usually it comes from the art itself. My first encounter with the Turkish artist and film-maker came with the 1999 video work Women Who Wear Wigs. Four characters told their stories on adjacent screens: a political activist obliged to disguise herself, a trans woman who had suffered abuse from the police, a chemotherapy patient, and a devout Muslim student banned from wearing a headscarf at a secular university. Each spoke insistently. It took effort to tune in and pay attention. The last major work I saw of Ataman’s – Küba (2004) – was in a warehouse in the Antwerp docks. Each of 40 old TV monitors broadcast an account given by a resident of Küba, one of Istanbul’s many informal, unlicensed neighbourhoods (the structures are known as gecekondu – literally “night built”). Stationed opposite the TV sets, armchairs invited you to sit and listen to individual stories among the hubbub. Bound up in the presentation were ideas about what it meant to focus amid clamour, and to make time to listen in the busy city. There was, implicitly, also a deeper question about why it took an art installation to achieve this. But there is also muttering of a more insidious kind. Since the rise to power of the Islamist populist Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (president since 2014, the country’s prime minister for 11 years prior) Turkey has been a dangerous environment for dissenting voices, and an increasingly hostile one for the LGBT community. Ten years ago, Ataman turned his back on Istanbul’s art scene, and a flourishing international career, and went to tend land in rural Anatolia. This show – split between a little first-floor gallery and a shop-front space in London’s Soho – is his return. While he may have stepped away from the art world, Ataman is still steeped in its references. The central work here The Stream is a conceptual companion to Nam June Paik’s classic Fire Piece (1992). The Paik work was a low mound of black TV monitors, smashed and whole, transmitting colour footage of flames. Ataman answers Paik’s fire with water: 20 old screens strapped to a rustic wooden frame show the artist digging irrigation ditches. While the tech in the gallery is new(ish), the vibe on screen is Old Testament. Ataman is barefoot on stony ground, gouging ditches with an old metal-headed hoe. The monitors are positioned so that the water, when it comes, flows upward, as if he were summoning some kind of miracle from the ancient soil. The hubbub of voices from Ataman’s earlier works is replaced by the insistent sound of metal on wet rubble. Shown nearby are black and white photographs of Anatolian villagers apparently turning their local minaret into a rocket and floating it into space. Taken from Ataman’s sharp 2009 mockumentary Journey to the Moon, the photographs remind us that this artist’s films and images are not always what they seem. Just in case we haven’t kept our wits about us, the other half of the show (presented in a second space) is called “fiction” – though again, how much we should trust that declaration is unclear. The most stirring works appear to be documentary photographs of badly beaten women in flimsy outfits walking in a desperate state along forest roads in the darkness. This series, Other Planets, was made during production of a feature film for which Ataman worked with trans people, recreating episodes of abuse they experienced in Turkey during the 1990s. These are complicated artefacts. As production photographs, they are indeed fiction. They are also records of real, traumatic, events. Do real life and cinematic fiction inevitably leak into one another, however incompatible the pairing might be? In a series of sculptural objects, cartoonish stills from the 1960s Turkish B movie Kilink are pasted to the undersides of scrappy bits of wooden furniture, together with fetishised items of underwear (a suspender belt, sheer stockings). The scenarios in the stills are preposterous – a villain disguised in a skeleton suit accosting young women in intimate apparel – yet they seem to have integrated themselves into a person’s home life, perhaps stirring sexual memories. The final work in this gallery of film references might be there for the title alone: a mop-like white wig floats on a dark screen, its fine tendrils every so often disturbed by someone breathing beneath the hair. The work shares its title with Samuel Fuller’s 1963 state-of-the-nation thriller Shock Corridor, which questions the power an individual has to transcend an oppressive environment. This, then, offers an overarching theme: how do you learn about sex when discussion is taboo? How do you construct a trans identity when every element of your person is threatened? How do you learn to draw water from stony ground?

4/20/2022,"The first season of Russian Doll (Netflix) was one of the best comedies of 2019, though to call it a comedy was to grasp at a rigidity that it never really claimed to have. It followed the trials and troubles of Nadia (Natasha Lyonne), a video game designer with a self-destructive streak, who kept dying after her 36th birthday party, only to find herself reincarnated at the same party, doomed to relive her death day in all of its glorious varieties, again and again and again. Its creators – Amy Poehler, Leslye Headland and Lyonne herself – found a morbid wit in Nadia’s predicament, and mined it for comedy, though by the end it had shape-shifted into something philosophical and profound. Fans will remember that Russian Doll resolved its time-loop crisis in the end, when Nadia and fellow frequent death sufferer Alan (Charlie Barnett) finally came together, which begs the question of what a second season could do. If it condemned Nadia and Alan to forget the lessons they worked so hard to learn in order to stick to the premise, it would have felt cruel, even nihilistic. It’s safe to say that this second season does not repeat its former concept, except that it deals with the matter of time – although that’s about all that is safe to say. This is best enjoyed with no spoilers; even revealing which actors play which characters would dent some of the satisfying surprises that appear along the tracks. Nadia is now approaching her 40th birthday, and, after the universe “trying to fuck with me”, as she once succinctly put it, is planning to celebrate with Alan in a more low-key way. It doesn’t go to plan. “The universe finally found something worse than death,” Nadia begins, and I’ll leave it there. This is a truly gorgeous series, from its aesthetic to its script, and it feels incredibly rich. It is filled with directorial homages to 1970s cinema, particularly the films of Robert Altman, and there are lots of clever scenes involving mirrors and reflections. It is stuffed with Lyonne wisecracking and swaggering around a variety of locations (again, I’m wary of spoilers, though New York City is a key character at this point) in her trenchcoat and sunglasses, to an apt soundtrack of Depeche Mode’s Personal Jesus. She is mesmerising as she lobs out erudite riffs on anything from hospital waiting rooms (“Is the hospital actually treating patients today or are we just putting on a Beckett play?”) to her inability to give up smoking: “I am keenly aware that my lungs are essentially two shrivelled up Nick Caves.” Just wait until she says “cockroach”. Once again, Lyonne takes the spotlight here and, by all accounts, the family-based storyline that runs through this season is personal. The supporting cast, including Chloë Sevigny returning as her mentally ill mother Lenora, and Schitt’s Creek’s Annie Murphy, who appears as, let’s just say, someone else, are also excellent, as are Nadia’s inner circle, particularly Elizabeth Ashley as Nadia’s substitute mother, Ruth. It feels more settled in its own skin than the first season, leaning more towards the dramatic than the comedic, though the old adage that comedy equals tragedy plus time gets a vigorous cross-examination here. I adore this series, and adore this season, though I do appreciate that its quirks may not be for everyone. Nor is it a flawless five stars. Alan’s storyline feels adrift from the rest, as if it exists only to keep Barnett in the mix. He and Nadia are having mutual-ish experiences, again, though are less anchored to each other. It is more sprawling, and less concise, despite having one fewer episode than season one, and it lacks the easy charm of the timeloop concept, which in turn makes it a more demanding watch. But it is so inventive, and creative, and original, that it seems petty to quibble. As the story progresses, it gets smarter and weirder, and the surreal twists once again land in an unsentimental yet beautiful place. It dares to ask big questions about trauma, grief and fate. If that doesn’t sound amusing, well, it still manages to be. Lyonne has said that if the first season was about how not to die, the second is about how to live. There are few television series that I want to watch again, and even fewer that I want to watch again immediately after the final credits roll. Who has the time? But this is all about bending the rules of time, and I plan to go back to the start to find out what I missed.",Arts/Television & radio,"Russian Doll review – did we need this second season?

4/20/2022,"David Beckham apparently unwinds at the end of a long day by playing with Lego, which he’ll do until the wee hours – two, three, four in the morning. “It relaxes me,” he said during an interview. It’s something I thought about a lot earlier this year, as my family existed in the perpetual, foggy fugue state otherwise known as “everyone got Covid the day before we were supposed to go on our first family vacation in more than two years, and so now we’re stuck in our apartment and can’t leave, and we thought this was over, already”. What did we do to pass the time? We watched movies. We made enough banana bread to feed China. We read books, and threw balls back and forth across the living room. We stretched together to the Cosmic Kids Yoga sessions that immediately flashed me back to those harrowing days in March 2020, when we were all Lysoling our vegetables and banging on kitchen pots to cheer on frontline workers as we watched the world unravel. And we built. Magna-Tile castles. Lego playgrounds. Lincoln Log villages. For hours on end. We combined all three materials, making Lincoln Log seesaws that ringed a blue Magna-Tile pool. We used triangles to make neon-colored Magna-Tile pizzas, which we served on Lego picnic tables. And as the piles of tissues around us grew – as the preschooler tested positive, then the baby, then my husband, as the kindergartner was the last one standing, as I thanked my lucky stars we knew more about this devastating virus and only had minor symptoms – we built our way to bedtime. Then we woke up, and did it again. We all know how important free play and imagination are to children’s brains – it’s a cornerstone of human development, and one of the many reasons the trend of sitting kids in front of screens and relying on technology for entertainment instead of requiring that they generate it themselves has been such a terrifying digital age evolution. But what was it specifically about building, I found myself wondering as we constructed towers, crashed them down, and erected them again, that was so innate, so soothing, so necessary? And why was it so satisfying to me, a grown woman who once got so overwhelmed by a set of Ikea instructions for a dresser that she lived for weeks with her socks and underwear in little piles on the floor? In my attempt to get at an answer, and as the house’s collective snot production started to wane, I came across a charming little book. Published in 1933 by one Harriet M Johnson, The Art of Block Building treats children’s play structures with the same solemnity as an art critic visiting a new exhibition. “One feels a lovely balance in Ingrid’s building, made at three years, seven months,” Johnson writes on one page. “The really dramatic quality about these young builders is not their mastery of techniques but their attitude towards the material,” she writes on another. Johnson was the founder, and then director, of the first ever laboratory nursery school in America, and a pioneer of the belief that early childhood was critical to later life success. She intuited that engaging with block building and construction was something innate to humans, and writes of a child’s “impulse” – the impulse to build, to name the structure, to dramatize what is going on around the structure – that is born nearly when they are. Yes, block building has baked-in engineering and mathematical concepts, and the activity has been linked to nearly every possible pre-school readiness skill: being good at math, having increased spatial awareness, cooperating and showing higher verbal ability. But for Johnson, just like for Beckham, the point of the play was more fundamental: it was, simply, to build. Whatever enrichment came from the activity was secondary. As time simultaneously constricted and expanded, bedtime somehow growing farther away as the day progressed, I joined my children in clicking blocks together, stacking them up, leaning them at weird angles, building bridges. “My tower has bunny ears!” the preschooler crowed. My own connection to the outside world grew increasingly tenuous, but I found myself unclenching my jaws and relaxing into the play, reconnecting with some pre-Ikea self that once enjoyed focusing on a task without an end goal in mind. “There is a pleasurable component for most of us in messing around with our hands,” Stuart Brown told me over the phone. “It’s an intrinsic part of our nature to enjoy hand-brain activity, which you’re doing with this construction-play. We lose that in the march towards adulthood, where it’s not quite as easy to access.” Brown is the founder of the National Institute of Play, a non-profit with the mission of studying the transformative power of play and applying it liberally to society. Decades ago, when lending his psychiatric services to a government commission investigating Charles Whitman, a marine veteran who killed 15 people from the tower of the University of Texas in 1966, he became attuned to the profound effect of the absence of play on homicidal men. In the intervening years, he’s come to believe that, for all ages, play can be as important to public health as other more mainstream initiatives. As we spoke, he mentioned the concept of “hand-brain coevolution”, the theory that the size of our brains, and our species’ unique cognitive capacity, is tied inextricably to the development of a hand that could throw rocks and make tools. It undergirds Johnson’s observations: the urge to click blocks together, to create and build, to touch and explore, is deeply embedded in being human. Brown labeled my week of construction time my “play vaccination” and told me that this inoculation, gained during minds-on moments when we’re plugged into silliness, fun, and pleasure without a purpose, is perhaps more critical to society – adults and children alike – than ever before, as we all come out of a period of tremendous anxiety and pressure. While these pockets of time may be hard to come by as adults, they’re arguably easiest for us parents, who live with members of the under-four-foot crowd. “It’s something you need to up your spirit, to increase connections in the brain, to alter your mood,” he said. “Play has very profound and powerful ramifications.” Just as we finished our quarantine, news of the war in Ukraine broke. The last few nights before bedtime stories and lullabies, we’ve continued to get down on the floor and build together. Who knows if this activity will stick. But it’s nice to know that even if our world gets smaller, even if the world continues to roil outside, we can take a few moments to build our way out.

4/20/2022,"When Kika Keith and her daughter opened a cannabis dispensary in South Central Los Angeles last year, they faced a design challenge: how could they create a store where older Black customers, who had seen all the ravages of the “war on drugs”, would feel comfortable making a purchase? It had been a tough battle for Keith to open a dispensary as a Black woman, in a post-legalized marijuana market where most of the business owners had become white men. She and her daughter, Kika Howze, wanted their store, Gorilla Rx Wellness Co, to reflect their focus on neighborhood investment and their hip-hop aesthetic. But they didn’t want to emulate the sleek hip-hop branding of youth-focused cannabis companies like Cookies or Stiizy, the kind of “shiny” dispensaries that had “music videos playing with girls’ breasts out”, as Keith put it. They would have Los Angeles-born hip-hop stars like Kendrick Lamar and ScHoolboy Q on their soundtrack, but they wanted their dispensary to feel like a grocery store, with products more reminiscent of a Whole Foods vitamin aisle. “We want to model what a community-first dispensary looks like, and at the head of our community is our elders,” Keith said. More than five years after California voters approved the sale of recreational marijuana, the legal weed market still faces plenty of economic and social challenges. But there’s also a wide variety of legal dispensaries across the state working to erase the stigma of criminalization and attract new cannabis consumers. What California’s legal marijuana stores actually look and feel like has been a key part of that redefinition. New entrepreneurs like Keith are continuing to push the boundaries of dispensary design, particularly when it comes to appealing to a broader range of Black consumers, while simultaneously pushing back against the “whitewashing” of the legal cannabis market. “Corporations conveniently forget that a lot of cannabis culture is centered around Black culture,” said Ebony McGee Andersen, the chief operating officer of Josephine & Billie’s, another South Los Angeles dispensary operated by and for Black women. “You can’t fake that. You can’t appropriate that.” Across California, there have been all kinds of experiments in legal dispensary design – some more successful than others. The past five years has introduced giant weed tourist attractions like Orange County’s Planet13, a marijuana theme park of a store that features a fake smoke-filled VW party bus with surf boards on top, and Deli by Caliva, a chain of dispensaries modeled after 1950s-style neighborhood sandwich counters. There was, briefly, a luxury shop within a Beverly Hills department store called “The High End,” which sold luxury French rolling papers and $1,100 bongs. (The department store, Barneys, filed for bankruptcy later that same year.) In Los Angeles, one of the clear winners in the race to define the aesthetic of the legal dispensary has been MedMen, a national cannabis company often referred to as the “Apple store of weed” for its sleek Scandinavian design and digital service. But as new companies try to find space in the challenging legal market, opening another dispensary with the same bland “Apple store” aesthetic is not enough, said Melanie Coddington, the Oakland-based founder of Sungrown Studio, which specializes in dispensary design. “Consumers want to know the owner’s story now,” said Coddington, who has designed at least 20 dispensaries across the country since 2019. As someone who previously focused on designing high-end residential properties, Coddington opened a cannabis design-practice with the goal of creating stores “that feel open, safe, welcoming to women”, in contrast to the medical marijuana dispensaries that felt “shady” and often “looked like a sad shabby dentist’s office”. To begin the design process, Coddington says, she gives new dispensary clients a style quiz with questions like, “Who is your ideal celebrity endorser? Are you more Martha Stewart, or Snoop Dog, or Reese Witherspoon?” The latest trend in cannabis design is “wellness,” with dispensaries that have “a yoga studio vibe, or a relaxing spa vibe”, she said. The sheer variety of California’s legal marijuana products – smokable, drinkable, edible, topical – “can be a little overwhelming” for consumers, and one of the challenges for dispensary design is creating an atmosphere were “canna-curious” newbies feel comfortable asking questions, said Mindi Basha, the vice- president of retail at the Parent Company, one of California’s largest cannabis corporations. Wyllow, a cannabis brand opening a dispensary in Beverlywood on 4/20, is modeling itself on the boutique experience of a Diptyque candle store or a Jo Malone perfume store, but with a distinctive Los Angeles twist. The dispensary looks like a tiny, neon-lined cathedral, with LED lights that shift color over the course of the day, and four velvet-covered banquettes for one-on-one consultations with a cannabis “atelier.” The store will have a sound installation at the door with recordings of “rustling rolling paper, exhaled smoke and taps on an ashtray”, and customers will start their visit by smelling different terpenes, the compounds that give weed strains their distinctive scent and flavor, to understand what profile they might enjoy most. Camille Roistacher, Wyllow’s founder, is modeling her luxury customer service on the Nordstrom’s shoe department, where she worked in high school and college. Customers would “ask for one pair of shoes, and you had to show them four pairs of shoes”, she said. Roistacher, who is Black and Mexican, came to the cannabis industry after years of working in tech. Her dispensary will introduce customers to a large proportion of women and BIPOC-owned cannabis brands, something she knows is crucial from her own struggle to get “shelf space” in dispensaries for her own cannabis brand. At Josephine and Billie’s, which brands itself as the first dispensary in the United States designed specifically by and for women of color, allowing customers to pick up and touch the products for sale was a key part of making the shopping experience feel safe, according to founder Whitney Beatty and Andersen, the chief operating officer. They didn’t want customers to feel profiled or like they were in a Walmart, “which has their black hair products behind glass”, Andersen said. Instead, their model for the customer experience was a combination of Disneyland and Sephora: a little magic and a lot of hands-on product education. The store is named after Black artists Josephine Baker and Billie Holliday, who faced persecution for smoking marijuana, and is designed to resemble a cannabis speakeasy “tea pad” of the American Jazz age, where Black patrons could smoke and talk in a relaxing environment. There’s a timeline on the wall with a long history of centuries of marijuana’s medicinal and social uses, putting the recent painful decades of prohibition in broader context. The store’s speakeasy-style entrance, where customers have to say a password to duck behind a velvet curtain into the main retail space, has resonated with customers, Andersen said, giving them a moment to take a breath and feel like they’re transitioning into a less anxious space. It’s a contrast not only with the long criminalization of marijuana, but also with the uncomfortable atmosphere of many male-owned dispensaries, which were marked by “a lot of sexism and misogyny”, Andersen said. Andersen and Beatty obsessed over the details of their store’s design, building a big bathroom for customers to use and selecting decor that would make the space feel “like your auntie’s living room”, so much so that they almost put a plastic cover on the store’s couch. With older Black women customers in mind, they’re also careful to stock a wide variety of cannabis products that don’t have to be smoked or inhaled, like creams and salves, or cannabis-infused honey, something that older women in their own families who were against marijuana were more willing to embrace. Gorilla Rx founder Keith, whose father was Rastafarian, was raised in a “really cannabis conscious” family, where the plant was important “for wellness and spiritual purposes”. But in South Central Los Angeles, she said, the “war on drugs” left a legacy not only of incarceration and criminalization targeting Black families, but also of selective enforcement, with “grimy” illegal trap shops allowed to keep operating in Black neighborhoods, even as they were cleared out of wealthier and whiter neighborhoods on the city’s west side. “It was really important that we created a space that was welcoming and inviting to our elders in the community and that had the ability to be wellness-focused and erase the stigma,” Keith said. LA peeps look! A Black woman owned dispensary is here!! Gorilla RX Wellness in south LA!! 🪴🪴🪴 pic.twitter.com/SXvjXpDd54 Working with Jocelyn Williams, a Black female designer, Keith and her daughter built a light-filled store decorated with bright color-blocking, with “joyful” design inspirations that included Keith’s grandmother, who kept her Christmas tree with its bright lights in her house for six months of the year; the Hello Kitty store in the mall she loved as a child; and a roller skating rink, which inspires the oval path customers take as they circle through the dispensary’s different options. Even before they made much of a social media marketing push, Howze said, the store repeatedly went viral on social media, with customers celebrating the existence of Los Angeles’s first Black woman-owned dispensary, and praising the comfort of shopping at a weed store with multiple Black female employees. To avoid the “post-gentrification aesthetic” of “this store is really great but I can’t afford anything in it”, Howze said, Gorilla Rx offers everything from a “$10 eighth to a $90 eighth.” A Black woman owns it too. So dope. https://t.co/reiuCzgIDk And to help Black customers “reclaim their wellness”, the store expanded their hours to open at 8am, Howze said, in order to cater to registered nurses and others stopping by the store before their morning shifts, for salves they can use for pain relief on their knees or wrists as they prepare to be on their feet all day. Convincing older Black Americans that cannabis products are safe to use can still be an uphill battle, Howze said: some of their younger customers will buy cannabis salves that they plan to repackage and give to relatives who need the pain relief but hate the idea of marijuana. But, she said, “There are other folks who come in with their parents. That’s a joy to see.”",News/US news,"Inside these LA dispensaries, Black women are redesigning what cannabis culture looks like",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/20/california-los-angeles-black-women-cannabis-dispensary
4/20/2022,"Welcome to The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly (and free) cricket newsletter. Here’s an extract from this week’s edition. To receive the full version every Wednesday, just pop your email in below. Cricket is not often accused of being short of statistics, but there is one that we hardly ever see. It measures what may be the most sought-after quality in sport: the ability to win. And the least sought-after – the tendency to lose. Welcome to the win/loss ratio, an off-putting name for a crucial metric. For this year’s Wisden Cricketers’ Almanack, which is published on Thursday, I’ve had a look at international captains through this lens. While doing the research, I also worked out the win/loss scores for England’s current (male) Test players. As they all play for the same team, you might expect them to be much of a muchness. Far from it: some players have a habit of being on the winning side, others don’t, and most of the time we have no idea which is which. Before doing the digging, you have to decide how far back to go. Four years seemed about right, because (a) it’s the traditional cycle of international cricket, (b) it covers the Covid bubble era but also plenty of normal sporting life, and (c) it means you don’t have to include more than one of the horror movies known as Ashes tours. So the starting point is spring 2018. England’s men have played 51 Tests since then, winning 22 and losing 20. The good news is that they are one of only four nations with more wins than losses. The bad news is that they’re a distant fourth behind Australia (won 16, lost 7), New Zealand (17:8) and India (24:13). Test cricket, like English football, has a big three. In those 51 games England have used 35 players, of whom 29 have tasted victory and 34 have tasted defeat. Not everyone’s a winner – that’s no lie. (Not everyone’s a loser either: Matthew Fisher, with his single cap, has only a draw.) If you work out the win/loss ratio for them all, you end up with a surprising top five. All hail Keaton Jennings! His record with the bat may be as middling as most other recent England openers, but when it comes to winning he’s second to none. He heads a motley quintet here, joined by two spinners, one swing-bowling all-rounder and one knight of the realm. All five are currently out of the fray – Adil Rashid concentrating on white-ball cricket, Sam Curran recovering from a back injury, Dom Bess recovering from the yips, Alastair Cook long since retired, Jennings in the wilderness since 2019. The only one to feature lately is Curran, who played two Tests against India last summer. Typically, he was there for England’s only win. Here’s the rest of the top 10: There’s yet another spinner, in Moeen Ali, making three in the top eight – but still no sign of the incumbent, Jack Leach. And there are two regulars in Jos Buttler and Stuart Broad, each outshining someone he trails in the pecking order. Jonny Bairstow has witnessed as many defeats as Buttler (13), but far fewer wins (also 13). And Jimmy Anderson, although he has outbowled his old mate Broad over the past four years, is less likely to end up on the winning side (won 14, lost 14). With some of these names, it’s not hard to see why they have flourished. Chris Woakes is picked more often at home, where England usually do better. All the spinners have been to Sri Lanka, a happy hunting ground for England since Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara retired. Seven of the top 10 have just missed an away Ashes, which does wonders for your win-loss ratio. But geography doesn’t account for everything. Some players really are serial winners. Buttler, although he had a dismal Ashes, brings the winning habit from white-ball cricket (as of Monday morning, he was the runaway leading scorer in this year’s IPL). Broad knows how to seize a game by the scruff of the neck. Anderson is more consistent, but Broad has more of the hot spells that win matches. Notice any other big names missing from the top 10? Joe Root is 11th, with 1.16 – 22 Tests won, 19 lost. All those hundreds haven’t made him a winner, though he ranks higher than Anderson (14th, equal with Bairstow, Jofra Archer and Jason Roy on 1.00) or Ben Stokes (18th on 0.94), who has 16 wins and 17 defeats. This doesn’t make Stokes a bad player: he’s still the hero of Headingley 2019. But it does show that he hasn’t often done it since. One broader point emerges from the figures. Several of England’s winners are bowlers who bat – Curran, Bess, Moeen and Woakes. (Moeen sees himself as a batter who bowls, but his recent stats beg to differ.) They are sometimes dismissed as bits-and-pieces players, but selecting them works, for a simple reason: it gives you greater numbers. It means there are five or six bowlers, so the workload is spread, the attack more varied. And there are decent batters down the order to cash in when opposing bowlers are tired. England now find themselves desperately needing victories. The win/loss ratio has some clear messages for whoever ends up selecting the team. Bring back Curran when he’s fit. Pick Broad over Anderson, unless you’re expecting a swing-fest. See whether Moeen can be lured out of Test retirement; if not, line up Matt Parkinson or Matt Critchley as the next Rashid. Bring back Buttler in place of Ben Foakes (and hand the gloves to Bairstow, who bats even better when keeping wicket). Rather than making Stokes a shoo-in for the captaincy, have a proper shortlist that includes Buttler and Broad. In general, when in doubt, pick a bits-and-pieces player. They’ll get as many runs as most of the specialist batters, and more wickets.",Sport/Sport,The Spin | Why studying England’s win/loss ratio can bring selectors some clarity,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/20/why-studying-england-winloss-ratio-can-bring-selectors-some-clarity-spin-cricket
4/20/2022,"A public university in Ohio has agreed to pay $400,000 to one of its professors after it rebuked him for refusing to use a student’s preferred pronouns. In 2018, Nicholas Meriwether, a philosophy professor at Shawnee State University in southern Ohio, addressed a transgender student as “sir” when she raised her hand in class. This prompted the university to launch an investigation into the incident. It found that Meriwether had created a “hostile environment” in the classroom. The university delivered Meriwether a written warning that stated that he could be fired or suspended without pay for violating the university’s nondiscrimination policy. Meriwether asked if referring to all students by self-asserted gender identity, and including a disclaimer in his syllabus that noted he was only doing so under “compulsion”, would comply with the university’s policies, which he was told would not. He also offered to refer to the student by either first or last preferred legal name without using gendered titles, but continued to refuse to refer to the student as a woman. Meriwether then sued the university, but had his case dismissed by a federal district court due to lack of standing. However, in 2020, a three-judge panel from the sixth US circuit court of appeals ruled that Meriwether is allowed to sue the school, writing in a 32-page opinion: “Traditionally, American universities have been beacons of intellectual diversity and academic freedom. They have prided themselves on being forums where controversial ideas are discussed and debated. And they have tried not to stifle debate by picking sides.” The judges, all of whom were Republican appointees, with two having been nominated by Donald Trump, added: “But Shawnee State chose a different route: It punished a professor for his speech on a hotly contested issue. And it did so despite the constitutional protections afforded by the first amendment. “The district court dismissed the professor’s free-speech and free-exercise claims. We see things differently and reverse.” The judges sent the lawsuit back to the lower court, where Meriwether could have argued that his rights to free speech and religion, as well as his 14th amendment right to due process, were violated and denied. As a result of the case, the university last week agreed to pay Meriwether $400,000 in damages and attorneys’ fees. In a separate statement, Shawnee State University explained their “economic decision” to settle the case, saying: “Though we have decided to settle, we adamantly deny that anyone at Shawnee State deprived Dr Meriwether of his free speech rights or his rights to freely exercise his religion.” It added: “Over the course of this lawsuit, it became clear that the case was being used to advance divisive social and political agendas at a cost to the university and its students. That cost is better spent on fulfilling Shawnee State’s mission of service to our students, families and community.”",News/US news,"US professor wins $400,000 payout after refusing to call trans student a woman",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/20/professor-shawnee-state-university-wins-damages-trans-student
4/20/2022,"Ukraine says it has reached a preliminary agreement with Russia on establishing a humanitarian corridor to evacuate outnumbered Ukrainian soldiers holed up with thousands of civilians in an iron and steelworks in the besieged city of Mariupol. Moscow is edging closer to full control of the city in what would be its biggest prize since it invaded Ukraine in February. Relentless bombardment and street fighting have left much of the city pulverised, killing at least 21,000 people by Ukrainian estimates. Its fall could mark the most strategic breakthrough for Russia since the beginning of the invasion. On Tuesday evening, according to reports that could not be independently verified by the Guardian, the Russian defence ministry offered a ceasefire for Wednesday, which would begin at 2pm Moscow time, and claimed it would let fighters surrender and leave unharmed. Earlier in the day, Russia called on Ukrainian forces to “immediately lay down arms” by issuing a fresh ultimatum for the defenders to end their resistance, after Ukrainian forces ignored a previous ultimatum on Sunday. Ukraine is aiming to evacuate 6,000 civilians in 90 buses from Mariupol on Wednesday, according to the mayor of the city, Vadym Boychenko. Boychenko said 100,000 civilians remained in the city and that tens of thousands have been killed. If the deal holds, it will be the first agreement reached on creating a safe corridor for civilians to flee Mariupol to other Ukrainian cities since 5 March. That agreement, however, quickly collapsed, and many residents have been trapped there for weeks without power, running water and other supplies. In video message published to his Facebook account early on Wednesday morning, Serhiy Volyna, a commander for the Ukrainian marines from the 36th Separate Marine Brigade fighting in Mariupol, said his forces were “maybe facing our last days, if not hours” and appealed for extraction. ‘’The enemy is outnumbering us 10 to one,” Volyna added. Boichenko said that about 40,000 civilians had been forcibly moved to Russia or Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine. “Unfortunately I have to declare that as of today they are forcibly deporting” residents, Boichenko told Ukrainian television. “We have verified through the municipal register that they have already deported over 40,000 people.” The fall of Mariupol, the largest trading port in the Azov Sea from which Ukraine exports grain, iron and steel, and heavy machinery, would be an economic blow to Ukraine and a symbolic victory for Russia. The town is a large port city and a base for Ukrainian armed forces. Taking control would give Moscow a land corridor from the Donbas to Crimea. The long-anticipated large-scale military operation in the Donbas and second phase of the war began on Monday with Russian forces carrying out one of the biggest barrages of missile strikes since the beginning of the invasion. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the intensity of fire by Russian troops towards Kharkiv, the Donbas and in Dnipro has “increased significantly”. Zelenskiy said the Russian military was throwing everything it has into the battle, with most of its combat-ready forces concentrated in Ukraine and just across the border in Russia. “They have driven almost everyone and everything that is capable of fighting us against Ukraine,” he said in his nightly video address to the nation. Despite claims that they are hitting only military sites, the Russians continue to target residential areas and kill civilians, he said. So far, according to Ukrainian officials, the frontline in Ukrainian-controlled Donbas is holding. The Ukrainian military expert Oleh Zhdanov described Kreminna in the northern Luhansk region as a “weak spot” – Russian forces seized the city on Tuesday and Ukrainian troops have withdrawn, the regional governor said. Moscow’s troops frequently attack Ukrainian positions from all sides, said Zhdanov, and were occupying jumping-off points on three sides of the Donbas region: north, east and south. The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, said Russian forces may be able to take some territory because of superior numbers and artillery. It stressed, however: “Russian operations are unlikely to be dramatically more successful than previous major offensives around Kyiv. The Russian military is unlikely to have addressed the root causes – poor coordination, the inability to conduct cross-country operations, and low morale – that impeded prior offensives.” In the northern Kharkiv region, Ukrainian forces mounted several successful counterattacks. They recaptured the villages of Bairak and Bobrivka, north-east of Kharkiv city, and Hurisivka, another village between Kharkiv and Izyum, where Russia has assembled a formidable attack force. On Monday, Oleksandr Motuzianyk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s ministry of defence, said Izyum was the area with the highest concentration of Russian troops. Izyum, regarded for centuries as the gateway to the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine and, from there, to the Black Sea, fell fully to Russian forces on 1 April, trapping thousands of civilians in a city where as many as 80% of its residential buildings have been destroyed. “The enemy has accumulated its forces in Izyum and, unfortunately, has a predominant number of manpower and heavy equipment,” Maksym Strelnyk, the deputy mayor, who managed to leave with thousands of fellow citizens before the town was captured, told the Guardian. “The Russians are trying to move in the direction of Donetsk region, but there are no serious successes. They are using Izyum as a foothold for the offensive and concentrating all their forces in the city. They set up their barracks, ammunition depots, hospitals, canteens. “The Russian army in this war is writing itself into world history forever as the most barbaric and inhuman army in the world,” Zelenskiy said.",News/World news,"Humanitarian corridor out of Mariupol agreed with Russia, says Ukraine",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/humanitarian-corridor-out-of-mariupol-agreed-with-russia-says-ukraine
4/20/2022,"A Taiwanese news channel has broadcast by mistake a fictional news alert that said Chinese armed forces had launched an invasion, firing missiles at cities and ports surrounding the capital, Taipei. Several news captions declaring a violent attack by China’s People’s Liberation Army had been mocked up for forthcoming security drills, but were broadcast accidentally to Taiwanese viewers at 7am on Wednesday. “New Taipei City was hit by communist missiles, the Taipei port has exploded, facilities and ships were damaged and destroyed,” the Chinese Television Systems (CTS) news ticker read. “On the brink of war … The Chinese Communist party prepares for war … The president has issued an emergency order.” The partly government-owned CTS station issued an on-air “clarification and apology” several hours later, saying the report had been created in conjunction with emergency services for the drills, but had been accidentally broadcast. “[Yesterday] CTS news channel cooperated with the New Taipei City government fire bureau to record a disaster prevention video. On the 20th, due to a wrong setting by the production staff, we mistakenly flashed the messages from yesterday about the war and disaster prevention. People do not need to panic.” The New Taipei fire department told the Guardian the fake news alerts were supposed to be shown on 5 May during the annual disaster response drills, which will this year include a missile attack scenario. “The exercise includes an earthquake scene, tsunami, a bridge collapse and explosion,” a spokesperson said. “This year, our boss said we will also include the war scenario in the exercise … It is the first time in recent years.” Taiwan’s defence minister, Chiu Kuo-cheng, said he had been “surprised to see the news”. Chiu said the army had responded quickly to verify and dispel the erroneous alert. The error was “a good lesson to our journalist friends”, he said. Screenshots of the broadcast spread across Taiwan’s social media, with some people expressing worry, some laughing at the error, and others criticising the TV station and media in general. “An unforgivable mistake, and perhaps not a mistake,” said one. “It needs serious punishment, they made social panic,” said another. In China, the error was viewed or discussed by more than a million people on Weibo, under the hashtag: “Taiwan media makes a big own goal.” Taiwanese opposition politicians called for regulators to punish the station for creating panic. Li Yong-de, the minister for culture who overseas public broadcasting, apologised. In a statement, CTS offered a “sincere apology that this serious flaw has caused panic among the public and trouble to relevant units”, and said those responsible would be punished. Taiwan has lived under the threat of invasion by neighbouring China for decades. The ruling Communist party considers Taiwan to be a breakaway province of China, and has not ruled out using force to “unify” it. Taiwan rejects Beijing’s claim, saying it is already an independent nation. Under the increasingly authoritarian rule of Xi Jinping, China’s government and armed forces have raised economic, diplomatic, and military pressure on Taiwan, including disinformation and propaganda campaigns. In the last two years there has been a marked increase of air force sorties into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone, and other military exercises designed to intimidate Taiwan, whose air force scrambles in response to each incursion. Taiwan is considered to be at the highest risk of invasion than in several decades, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sparked alarm among the island’s leaders and population, but few analysts or observers believe such an attack on Taiwan is imminent.

4/20/2022,"The Australian government woke up Wednesday morning to a Solomon Islands-shaped headache. Tuesday night, news broke that the Pacific nation, less than 2,000km from Australia’s east coast, had signed a security deal with China. A draft of the agreement, leaked on social media last month, contained concerning provisions, including one that suggested the deal could allow China to establish a military base in the country, with the draft text permitting China to “make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands”. Before the rounds of morning radio and television were done, it was clear that Labor was determined that the Solomons-China deal would be the issue of the day. Penny Wong lashed the Coalition when she told ABC radio the government’s handling of the situation was “the worst Australian foreign policy blunder in the Pacific since the end of world war two”. Labor is doing its best to try to link this agreement to the government’s perceived weak spot: dropping the ball in a time of crisis. “No visit from the foreign minister, no visit from the defence minister, no engagement in a serious way with prime minister Sogavare,” said Anthony Albanese. Australia can overstate its ability to shape the foreign policy of independent countries in the region, as Pacific analysts were quick to point out. “Appreciate Penny Wong is campaigning, but this assumes Australia has ‘influence’ over the Pacific,” tweeted Joanne Wallis, professor of international security at the University of Adelaide. “I’ve heard so many Australian ‘experts’ say that, for example, we need to ‘stop’ Solomons or elsewhere hosting a Chinese base. As though this is up to Australia.” Scott Morrison, in full pugilistic swing at a press conference on Wednesday morning, defended his government’s record in the Pacific and said he was “pleased the Labor party are catching up on this issue” of Chinese interest in the Pacific, which was something he has “known about and [has] been taking strong action about” for years. He also insisted his government’s response had been carefully “calibrated” to be respectful to Solomon Islands and to recognise its sovereignty. “Our view is very much that you don’t go stomping around telling Pacific Islands what they should and shouldn’t do,” said Morrison. Incidentally, this view may be news to some Pacific leaders, many of whom had their last in-person meeting with him at the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu in 2019. Tuvalu’s prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, said he had been “stunned by the un-Pacific tenor and manner” of Morrison’s behaviour at that forum, and a furious Frank Bainimarma, the prime minister of Fiji, accused Morrison of being “very insulting and condescending” to other leaders as they clashed on the issue of climate action. Given Sogavare’s style of governing and domestic political pressures in Solomon Islands, it seems unlikely that any ministerial intervention from Australia was going to slow down a deal that Sogavare was intent on signing. Solomon Islands is a sovereign country with complicated domestic politics, not to mention huge economic and social challenges. There are lots of things at play that don’t have to do with Australia. But it also offers a moment to consider whether Australia is the good partner for the Pacific that it thinks it is. Morrison reamed off Australian contributions to the region at his press conference on Wednesday – aid to the region, Covid-19 vaccines, undersea cable projects and responding to crises, such as the recent volcano and tsunami in Tonga, or riots in Solomon Islands last year. These are all good things and important contributions Australia has made to the Pacific. But there is one area in which Australia consistently falls down as a partner: climate change, which Pacific leaders have repeatedly said is the gravest security threat it faces. There might not be a direct link between Australia’s climate policy and the security deal – Morrison certainly thinks there isn’t, dismissing such a connection as “nonsense” today – but it is without doubt that Australia’s climate policy has contributed to the dimming of Australia’s reputation in the region, especially given Australia claims to be family. A Pacific climate envoy once described Australia’s relationship with the Pacific region on the issue of climate change to me as “dysfunctional” and “abusive” – providing aid to the region to deal with the effects of global warming but undermining attempts to halt its progress at the same time. Labor is arguing there is more that Morrison could have done to prevent Solomon Islands from signing this deal with China, and we’ll never truly know if they’re right. But there is something Australia can do to bolster security in the Pacific and to firm up its position as a trusted partner there: listen to its neighbours and act on the climate crisis.",News/World news,Solomon Islands’ security pact with China raises the question is Australia the partner for the Pacific it thinks it is | Kate Lyons,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/solomon-islands-security-pact-with-china-raises-the-question-is-australia-the-partner-for-the-pacific-it-thinks-it-is
4/20/2022,"Good morning. Russia has increased the intensity of its eastern offensive but has been repeatedly repelled by Ukrainian forces, the UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said, as western governments pledged to send more artillery, and a new deadline for surrender in Mariupol approached. The MoD said late on Tuesday that shelling and strikes were increasing over the line of control in Donbas but that Russian forces continued to be hampered by logistical and technological problems. It also noted an “inability to stamp out resistance” in Mariupol as a sign of failure to achieve Moscow’s objectives. The Russian defence ministry has said it will offer the besieged port city a ceasefire today to allow Ukrainian defenders holed up in the Azovstal steelworks to lay down their arms. About 1,000 civilians are reportedly hiding in underground shelters beneath the steel plant in Mariupol, according to the city council. Most of the civilians are believed to be women with children and elderly people. How are Ukrainian troops faring in Mariupol? A commander for the Ukrainian marines in Mariupol said his forces were “maybe facing our last days, if not hours” and appealed for extraction, in a Facebook post published early this morning. What is happening with the diplomatic effort? Western nations are preparing to stage coordinated walkouts and other diplomatic snubs in protest at Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Washington. Janet Yellen, the US treasury secretary, is planning to avoid sessions attended by Russian officials. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 56 of the invasion. Donald Trump attempted a coup on 6 January 2021 as he tried to salvage his doomed presidency, and that will be a central focus of forthcoming public hearings of the special House panel investigating events surrounding the insurrection at the US Capitol, the congressman Jamie Raskin has said. Raskin is a prominent Democrat on the committee and also led the House efforts when Trump was impeached for a historic second time, in 2021, accused of inciting the storming of the US Capitol by his extremist supporters who were trying to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. “This was a coup organized by the president against the vice-president and against the Congress in order to overturn the 2020 presidential election,” Raskin said in an interview with the Guardian, Reuters news agency and the Climate One radio program. Public hearings by the bipartisan special committee investigating January 6 and related actions by Trump and his White House team and other allies, chaired by the Mississippi Democrat Bennie Thompson, are expected next month. What else did Raskin say? “We’re going to tell the whole story of everything that happened. There was a violent insurrection and an attempted coup and we were saved by Mike Pence’s refusal to go along with that plan.” Reproductive rights advocates in Texas have filed a new legal challenge to halt a near total abortion ban that has been in effect for more than half a year. Senate bill 8 bars abortion once embryonic cardiac activity is detected – typically as early as six week of pregnancy, which is before most people are aware they are pregnant – and offers no exception for rape or incest. The lawsuit, filed yesterday, asks a federal court to rule the extreme law unconstitutional. It cites public threats and legal action from anti-abortion activists against Texas abortion funds, groups that have been instrumental in helping patients travel out of state for care, arguing that this conduct has chilled their first amendment rights. “Plaintiffs urgently need this court to stop Texas’s brazen defiance of the rule of law, uphold the federal constitutional rights of pregnant Texans, and restore the ability of abortion funds and their donors, employees and volunteers to fully serve Texas abortion patients,” the federal court filing reads. Wendy Davis, a former Texas senator who famously led an 11-hour filibuster against an anti-abortion bill in 2013, said: “We are asking the courts today to stop the unconstitutional harassment of abortion funds by confirming SB 8 cannot be used to silence donors with bogus threats.” Prince Harry has said the Queen was “on great form” during their recent meeting, and he wanted to make sure she had “the right people around her”. Speaking to NBC about his meeting with the monarch, Harry said: “Being with her it was great, it was just so nice to see her, she’s on great form.” In a 59-page opinion on Monday, the US district judge Kathryn Mizelle of Tampa, Florida, overturned the federal requirement that people wear masks on planes and public transportation. She has become an instant heroine of the Republican right hailed for “courage” and “common sense”. The Fantastic Beasts star Ezra Miller has been arrested on suspicion of assault in Hawaii. Miller already faces charges of harassment and disorderly conduct after an incident last month at a karaoke bar on the island. A growing number of cities and states have restricted the information that local law enforcement departments can exchange with immigration authorities. But new documents reveal that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has tapped private technology companies to skirt such sanctuary policies. Netflix lost subscribers for the first time in 10 years at the start of the year and said it expects to lose even more in the spring, sending its share price crashing again yesterday. The streaming giant’s share price initially fell close to 20% on news that ​​it had lost 200,000 subscribers globally during the first quarter. Some of the largest, most profitable companies in retail and food services are still paying most of their workers less than $15 an hour, and many staff still make less than $10 an hour, according to a new company wage tracker developed by the Economic Policy Institute and the Shift Project. According to a 2021 report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a worker needs to make at least $20.40 an hour to afford the rent of the average one-bedroom apartment in the US. Ashley Stayner is a self-professed true crime fan. She also happens to have had a front-row seat to two true crime narratives in her own family, writes Radheyan Simonpillai. Her father is the abduction victim turned hero Steven Stayner, the subject of the two-part television movie I Know My First Name is Steven, which aired in 1989. Her uncle is Carey Stayner, the serial killer sitting on death row for the Yosemite murders, which have been covered on numerous true crime programs such as American Justice, FBI: Criminal Pursuit and more. The Biden administration is launching a $6bn effort to rescue nuclear power plants at risk of closing, citing the need to retain nuclear energy as a carbon-free source of power that helps to combat climate change. “US nuclear power plants contribute more than half of our carbon-free electricity, and President Biden is committed to keeping these plants active to reach our clean energy goals,” said the energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm. “We’re using every tool available to get this country powered by clean energy by 2035.” An aggressive humpback whale appeared to turn the tables on a pod of orcas off the Canadian coast, stalking and then ambushing the group that more usually would have been attacking it.

4/20/2022,"Just Eat Takeaway is considering selling off its Grubhub arm after reporting a decline in orders compared with bumper levels during Covid lockdowns. The takeaway delivery specialist said orders dropped by 1% to 264.2m in the first three months of 2022 as it struggled when trying to match the pandemic-boosted levels from a year earlier, when many cafes, restaurants and hospitality venues remained closed for several months. As a result, the company reduced its transaction value and earnings forecasts for the year. It also warned that it was expecting growth to remain “challenging” between April and June. The Netherlands-based Just Eat only agreed to buy the US-based app Grubhub for $7.3bn (£5.8bn) in June 2020, in a deal that was completed last year. The tie-up created the world’s largest food delivery service outside China, and gave Just Eat access to the lucrative food delivery market in the US, adding to its base in some of the world’s other most profitable markets: the UK, the Netherlands and Belgium. Reporting its results for the first three months of the year, Just Eat said in a statement that it was “actively exploring the introduction of a strategic partner into and/or the partial or full sale of Grubhub”. Jitse Groen, Just Eat’s chief executive, said: “Our priority for 2022 lies in enhancing profitability and strengthening our business. “We expect profitability to gradually improve throughout the year, and to return to positive adjusted Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) in 2023.” Groen added that there was no guarantee that talks about the future of Grubhub would lead to a deal. The announcement comes only weeks after the company revealed a pre-tax loss of more than €1.1bn (£916m) for 2021, after making significant investments, although it said it was “rapidly progressing towards profitability”. Just Eat said in March when reporting its results that northern Europe was its most profitable region, while it had doubled the number of orders placed by customers in the UK and Ireland over the past two years. Even though it is best known for its restaurant and fast food delivery, the company has entered the fast grocery delivery market in the UK, the Netherlands and Canada, and said there had been “significant progress” in this area. After a tie-up with Asda in the UK, Just Eat is giving a trial to a fast delivery service for customers of the Central England Co-op, where shoppers at 10 stores across Cambridgeshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Northamptonshire, the West Midlands and Yorkshire can get their groceries brought to their door. Just Eat followed its rivals Deliveroo and Uber Eats into the grocery delivery market, which already had fast delivery deals with some of the UK’s biggest supermarkets.
