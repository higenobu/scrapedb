1/28/2022,"More than five years after a North Carolina mother and her then-1-year-old daughter vanished, they were found safe just 20 miles away from home. Amber Renaye Weber, then 21, and daughter Miracle Smith were found at a home in Bunnlevel, N.C., Tuesday, the U.S. Marshals announced. Weber and Smith were last seen on Dec. 4, 2016, in Fayetteville and reported missing several weeks later on Jan. 31. All leads went cold until Fayetteville Police Department’s Investigative Assistant Sonia Roldan took over the investigation a year ago and began collaborating with the U.S. Marshals. The U.S. Marshals said the investigation “developed information” that the missing child and mother were in Bunnlevel and “may be associated with (Joe) Smith,” who was arrested on Jan. 19 for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Officials found Miracle at the Bunnlevel home and turned her “and her sibling over to the Harnett County Department of Social Services to provide victim assistance.” Four guns were also found at the home. Brandon Taylor, a deputy U.S. Marshal with the Investigative Operations Division, told the Daily News that Amber gave birth to Miracle’s sibling after the pair went missing, but could not identify the child’s father. Police did not disclose their relationship to Smith, but Taylor told The News that he appears to be Miracle’s grandfather. Amber and Miracle were previously abused before they went missing, according to officials. Monty Weber, Amber’s father, told CBS17 that she had been staying with her sister before vanishing, then “took off in the middle of the night” with the baby. “The culmination of years of following leads and tips resulted in the outcome that we had all hoped for today; the successful recovery of a child who had been missing since December 2016,” Michael East, U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of North Carolina, said in a statement. “The U.S. Marshals Service and our investigative partners will not quit, nor be deterred, until these children are rescued.” ———",U.S./NY Daily News,Missing North Carolina mother and daughter found safe after five years,https://news.yahoo.com/missing-north-carolina-mother-daughter-022600951.html
1/28/2022,"Apple (AAPL) reported its Q1 earnings on Thursday, blowing away Wall Street's expectations with a historic quarter on strong demand for the iPhone 13 and services. Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what analysts were expecting from the company as compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue: $123.95 billion versus $119.05 billion expected. Earnings per share: $2.10 versus $1.90 per share expected. iPhone: $71.6 billion versus $67.7 billion expected1. iPad: $7.2 billion versus $8.1 billion expected. Mac: $10.8 billion versus $9.5 billion expected. Wearables: $14.7 billion versus $14.1 billion expected. Services: $19.5 billion versus $18.6 billion expected. Apple's stock was up more than 1% following the announcement. The company's revenue jumped some 11% in Q1 despite the ongoing chip shortage, which took a $6 billion bite out of Apple's revenue in Q4 2021. ""This quarter’s record results were made possible by our most innovative lineup of products and services ever,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. “We are gratified to see the response from customers around the world at a time when staying connected has never been more important."" The holiday quarter is incredibly important for Apple, as it provides Wall Street with a look at how the company's products may perform throughout the rest of the year. Moving forward, Wedbush's Dan Ives offered a positive outlook for Apple's Q2. “While the supply chain issues have curtailed some growth for Apple on this massive product cycle playing out across its entire hardware ecosystem, we believe the pent-up demand story for Cupertino is still being underestimated by investors with chip issues a somewhat transitory issue in our opinion,” Ives wrote. Bloomberg reports that Apple is also expected to launch a 5G-capable version of its iPhone SE in the coming months, along with updated versions of its iPad and Mac laptops. But it will be some time before those rumored products show up on Apple’s bottom line.

1/28/2022,"After two decades at Fox, Troy Aikman could be moving on. Soon. Aikman concedes to Clarence E. Hill, Jr. of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that Sunday’s 49ers-Rams NFC Championship could be Aikman’s last with Fox. “It could be, yeah,” Aikman said. “I don’t anticipate that but it could be.” Aikman reportedly has been targeted by Amazon for Thursday Night Football. He could end up working for both networks. A major factor in any discussions involving Aikman will be money. With Tony Romo inching toward $20 million per year and Aikman currently (reportedly) in the range of $7.5 million annually, it’s time for the rising Romo tide to lift other boats, as it inevitably will — no matter how crazy anyone else may think Romo’s compensation page is. It is what it is, and the influx of gambling money is only going to keep it moving farther and farther north. “Those conversations are happening now,” Aikman told Hill regarding his potential suitors. “And I’m really being as honest as I can be about it. I really don’t know what it’s gonna look like when it’s all said and done and it does get settled. As to whether I’ll be working for Fox and Amazon, whether I’ll just be working for Fox or whether I’ll just be working for Amazon. I really don’t know what might happen.” Neither is also an option, in theory. But that’s highly unlikely. That said, Aikman said in late 2019 that he has entertained making the Millen-Lynch move from broadcast booth to G.M. gig with an NFL team. There has never been any serious chatter from a team’s perspective about that happening. If Aikman ultimately has to choose between Fox and Amazon, he could be inclined to explore a new beginning. In 2019, he got a talking-to after taking Twitter shots at resident Fox colleague Doug Gottlieb, who described Andrew Luck’s decision to retire over rehabbing an injury as “the most millennial thing.” In 2016, Aikman publicly complained about the network’s decision to hire Skip Bayless. “Clearly, [then-Fox Sports president of national networks] Jamie Horowitz and I have a difference of opinion when it comes to building a successful organization. I believe success is achieved by acquiring and developing talented, respected and credible individuals, none of which applies to Skip Bayless.” So maybe, if Amazon is ready to stuff enough cash into Aikman’s pockets, he’ll finally tell folks like Bayless and Gottlieb to go Fox themselves, and change networks.

1/28/2022,"Former President Donald Trump is claiming that he can't find the supplies to produce his book. Trump said that he was told his publisher can't find enough paper, ink, glue, or leather to produce the book. Trump's book is published by Winning Team Publishing, a company co-founded by Donald Trump Jr. in 2021. Former President Donald Trump claimed this week that he couldn't get enough supplies to produce his book because of ongoing supply chain disruptions. Trump spoke to Fox Business host Lou Dobbs on a Wednesday episode of Dobbs' podcast, ""The Great America Show."" Trump responded to a question from Dobbs about how he felt about product shortages in the US, claiming that he faced problems printing his book because of issues with the supply chain.  ""Nobody ever heard the term 'supply chain,'"" Trump said. ""The supply chain, it was automatic. It just was embedded. It was embedded in a free country, in a democracy. It was embedded in our country. We didn't sit around talking about the supply chain. Now all of a sudden, it's the two words people are using most because you can't get anything.""  He went on to claim that he was running out of supplies to produce copies of his book, ""Our Journey Together.""  ""I just did a book, which is very successful, they sold 240,000 copies, and we just ordered another 240,000, I guess, or more,"" Trump said. ""The publisher, the printer, who is one of the biggest in the country, I think he said he has eight plants, he said, 'Well we have one problem — we can't get paper, we can't get ink. We can't get glue. We can't get leather for the covers.' He said, 'I've been doing this for 40 years, I've never had a problem getting anything,"" Trump said.  Trump added that his publisher was paying ""a huge premium"" to get these supplies.  Trump's publisher for ""Our Journey Together,"" Winning Team Publishing, is a company that was co-founded by his son, Donald Trump Jr., in 2021. It brands itself as ""the nation's premier conservative publishing house,"" with the mission of promoting ""authors who represent the Silent Majority, America First patriots, and liberty-minded readers.""  Winning Team Publishing claimed on its website that ""every single copy of Our Journey Together is proudly printed in America,"" noting that ""overwhelming demand and global supply chain issues"" have caused production delays. Two versions of ""Our Journey Together"" are available, one for $74.99 and a signed copy at $229.99. However, the descriptions of both books do not appear to indicate that they are leather-bound. According to the book's listing on Winning Team Publishing's website, copies are scheduled to ship in February 2022.  This past June, Trump boasted that he was ""writing like crazy"" and working on ""the book of all books"" about his presidency. In November, he revealed the book would be a coffee table book filled with photos. Donald Trump Jr. told Axios in that month: ""My father picked every single photo in this book, wrote all the captions, including some by hand.""

1/28/2022,"YAMHILL, Ore. (AP) — Former New York Times journalist Nicholas Kristof traded the concrete canyons of Manhattan and the ritzy New York suburb of Scarsdale for his old family home, located on a dirt road in Oregon, to run for governor. But Kristof, who won two Pulitzer Prizes, including for reporting on China's failed 1989 pro-democracy movement, was declared ineligible for the seemingly simplest of reasons: He hadn't lived in Oregon long enough. Kristof has gone to the state Supreme Court to fight the Jan. 6 decision. The justices could begin deliberating the matter as early as Thursday. During an interview at his farm on the outskirts of the tiny town of Yamhill (population 1,000), Kristof spoke with concern about the plight of neighbors he had grown up with after moving here when he was 12. Some are barely hanging on financially. Some have died from drugs, suicide and obesity. One froze to death while homeless. “At The New York Times, I had a very good toolbox to call attention to problems, but it wasn’t a toolbox to fix them,” Kristof said of his decision to trade journalism for politics. Three dogs gamboled about as Kristof, whose curly hair is graying, spoke during the interview in a shed. Several acres of pinot noir and chardonnay grapevines soaked up the wintry sunshine, with the first harvest expected this year. Kristof and his wife, Sheryl WuDunn — who shared the Pulitzer for the China reporting — wrote a book, “Tightrope,” about the despair of so many in Oregon and beyond as blue-collar jobs disappeared and hourly wages kept falling when adjusted for inflation. Easy access to opioids compounded problems, causing addiction and overdoses. He's also written about the issues as a columnist for The New York Times, a position he resigned from last year to run for governor. He lives once again in the family house with his wife and his 89-year-old mother. He says he saw the coronavirus pandemic make things worse — some old friends relapsed and resumed using drugs, some became homeless, some kids doing remote learning didn't have cell phone or internet access. COVID-19 was the tipping point that made him run as a Democratic candidate for the state's highest office, he said. But the fact that Kristof voted in New York state in 2020 was the main evidence Oregon election officials cited behind their decision that he hadn't been “a resident within” Oregon for three years before the November 2022 election, as the state Constitution requires. “For 20 years living, working, raising his kids, holding a driver’s license, filing taxes and voting as a New York resident until a year ago just doesn’t pass the smell test,” Secretary of State Shemia Fagan said. Kristof's candidacy, meanwhile, has raised questions about what makes a true Oregonian. His attorneys told the Supreme Court that Fagan's broad interpretation of the Constitution's requirements for governor may disfavor candidates like Kristof who frequently travel and maintain multiple residences. Kristof regularly visited his Oregon property, which he expanded over the years after moving away to attend Harvard and Oxford before joining the Times. “There are many peripatetic Oregonians who, for various reasons, live in more than one place and may prefer candidates who understand the experience of living in multiple places or changing residences often,” the lawyers wrote, citing “seasonal migrant workers,"" university students, soldiers and others. Reyna Lopez, executive director of Oregon's farmworkers union, PCUN, and the daughter of Mexican immigrant farm workers, objected to the comparison. “For a wealthy white man to compare the fact that he owns property in Oregon while living in New York to the lives and experiences of migrant workers is deeply shocking. Farmworkers are forced into an itinerant and difficult life ... to survive and support their families,"" Lopez said in a brief filed with the court in support of Fagan's decision. Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, who is defending Fagan's decision at the Supreme Court, referenced concerns that are as old as Oregon that outsiders would seek political office here. Delegates to Oregon's Constitutional Convention of 1857 expressed the “holy horror of your California graceless, godless school of politicians” coming to Oregon in search of office, Rosenblum said. Kristof's attorneys insisted ""he has been a resident of the state for many years, his ties to Oregon are deep and abiding, and voters — not elections officials — should decide his suitability to be governor."" Fagan on Jan. 6 told reporters that according to Oregon law, “if a person casts a ballot in another state, they are no longer a resident of Oregon.” But former Secretaries of State Bill Bradbury and Jeanne Atkins pointed out to the court that the provision concerns the right to cast a ballot, not “the right to be on the ballot.” “So, even while saying that voting elsewhere costs you the right to vote here, the Legislature has not said that it also costs you the right to run for office here,” they said. Kristof has raised $2.7 million in campaign donations. That figure includes large donations from out of state, but also contributions from every county in Oregon. If the court upholds Kristof's disqualification, he won't have to return the money. He could use it for a different campaign. Yamhill County Commissioner Casey Kulla, who was also running for governor before going for state labor commissioner instead, said he has encouraged Kristof to run for the state House, Congress or the county commission. If the court overturns Fagan, Kristof will face leading candidates Tina Kotek, who recently resigned as Oregon House Speaker, and state Treasurer Tobias Read for the Democratic nomination in the May primary. Kristof won't say what he'll do with the campaign contributions if the court rules against him. “I have great confidence in the Oregon Supreme Court,"" he said. ""So I’ll be on the ballot and we will need those donations.” Kristof and WuDunn still own their house in Scarsdale. A campaign spokeswoman said they intend to sell it. ___ Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky",U.S./Associated Press,Ruined lives prompted Kristof's run for Oregon governor,https://news.yahoo.com/kristof-tries-show-oregon-home-150027179.html
