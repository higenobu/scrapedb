5/16/2022,"New Zealand will help some people to buy electric vehicles, end its reliance on fossil fuels, lower agricultural emissions, and reduce waste going to landfill, the government has promised in the most significant announcement on climate change action in the country’s history. The emissions reduction plan sets the direction for climate action for the next 15 years, with a cap on the amount of greenhouse gas New Zealand can emit, in order to meet targets to limit the global average temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The government announced the details of New Zealand’s first comprehensive plan to slash climate emissions and how it will be funded at parliament on Monday. The plan last week garnered near cross-party support, which will give it enduring influence if there is a change in government. Two minor parties did not support the plan – the rightwing ACT party, which said it is not necessary, while Te Pati Māori (the Māori Party) said it does not go far enough. The finance minister, Grant Robertson, has revealed how the “climate emergency response fund” – generated from emissions trading and ringfenced for climate spending – will be allocated, ahead of the primary budget announcement on Thursday. “This is a landmark day in our transition to a low emissions future,” Jacinda Ardern said in a statement. The day will be bittersweet for the prime minister, who has called climate change this generation’s “nuclear-free moment” and long campaigned on the promise to slash emissions, but was unable to attend the announcement due to testing positive for Covid-19 and needing to isolate at home. “The emissions reduction plan delivers the greatest opportunity we’ve had in decades to address climate change,” Ardern said. “We can’t opt out of the effects of climate change so we can’t opt out of taking action.” The minister of climate change, James Shaw, said the plan would lay the path towards a net zero future where more people could buy electric vehicles, towns and cities would have better transport infrastructure, the highest emitters would switch to clean energy, farmers would grow food in a way that helps the climate, and warmer, more affordable heating options for homes would exist. It would ensure an equitable transition for Māori, through developing a Māori action plan and through funding and resources for Māori-led programmes and solutions. “This is a historic day for climate action in Aotearoa,” Shaw said. “Because of this work, New Zealand is on track to bend the curve of its emissions downwards for the first time in its history.” One of the most significant initiatives is the clean car upgrade programme, which will support lower and middle income families to transition to low-emission alternatives through a “scrap and replace” trial. That will allow eligible families to trade in their vehicles and receive support to buy electric or hybrid vehicles, which will in turn be cheaper to run. This, and plans to improve public transport through greener bus fleets, better cycleways and walkways, and more frequent trains, will put the country on track to make zero-emissions vehicles 30% of the light vehicle fleet (cars, vans and utes) and reduce the total kilometres light vehicles travel by to 20% by 2035, the government says. More than $1.2bn had been allocated towards this part of the plan, which was expected to reduce emissions equivalent to taking 181,000 cars off the road between now and 2035, said Michael Wood, the minister of transport. The climate fund was established using an initial $4.5bn from the emissions trading scheme – which charges certain businesses for the greenhouse gases they emit – and meant “the polluters are paying [for pollution], not households”, Robertson said. A portion of that fund – $1.3bn – has been earmarked for international climate aid, with half committed to the Pacific. Another $1.5bn will be allocated in future budgets. Further spending announcements will be made as part of the overall 2022 budget announcement on Thursday. On Monday, Robertson announced the first tranche of funding allocations. One of the largest investments, at just over $650m over four years, will go towards decarbonising industry and speeding up the switch to cleaner energy options. Megan Woods, the minister of energy and resources, said: “Rising global energy prices we cannot control show we must wean ourselves off expensive fossil fuels.” Emissions from the energy and industry sectors made up 27% of New Zealand’s total emissions, she added. Agricultural emissions are being largely dealt with in a separate policy called He Waka Eke Noa – a five-year programme working with the sector to reduce methane and build resilience. But the government has committed more than $700m over four years to lower agricultural emissions, expand the contribution of forestry to reduce carbon, and produce alternative “green” fuels. Central to this is the establishment of the new centre for climate action on agricultural emissions, which will drive innovation and product development. New Zealand has long relied on its “clean green” image for tourism, trade and wider global cultural cache, and has regularly made headlines for some of its grander gestures, including when Ardern declared a climate emergency. But the country’s green reputation has become more untenable in recent years. The country’s gross emissions per person are high and it is one of the world’s worst performers on emissions increases. Emissions in New Zealand rose by 57% between 1990 and 2018 – the second-greatest increase of all industrialised countries. “New Zealand trades on its environmental reputation – it is the key to the ongoing security of our primary exports and tourism, our two main export earners,” Robertson said, adding that investing in low-emissions projects and industries would protect those industries. “These [overall] plans mark the greatest transformation for the economy and New Zealand society in my time in politics.”",News/World news,Help to buy EVs in ‘landmark’ New Zealand net zero climate plan,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/help-to-buy-evs-in-landmark-new-zealand-net-zero-climate-plan
5/16/2022,"Every major opinion poll failed to predict Scott Morrison’s re-election in 2019, but once again news organisations have run numerous stories based on polls in the current campaign, including some that point to dramatic results nationally and in specific seats. The 2019 result sent shock waves through the polling industry, and kicked off a period of reflection, innovation and transparency. Pollsters now promise greater rigour, and have deployed some new techniques, but they have also urged voters to think differently about what polls can tell them. So what weight can we lay on the opinion polls as the election approaches? Murray Goot, an emeritus professor of politics and a leading polling expert, believes one problem was that the polling companies herded together behind a Labor victory as “the risk of being the lone fool was much greater than being one of many fools”. An inquiry into the performance of the polls in 2019 found the errors were not the result of a last-minute shift in voter sentiment, nor of voters deliberately misleading pollsters, but that the polls overestimated Labor’s vote because their samples were “unrepresentative and inadequately adjusted”. Most polls published by news outlets rely on online survey-based polling, with the exception of Roy Morgan and Ipsos, which also incorporate telephone interviews. Pollsters ask respondents about their voting intention and past voting patterns, as well as demographic and socioeconomic information. Many of these companies will pay respondents for completing the online-based surveys – so if you’re wondering if you’ve ever been polled by one of the newspapers, you should know. Also in the mix is so-called “robopolling”, more commonly used in seat- and topic-specific polling from groups such as uComms. These are the phone calls you get from a random number, with an automated voice listing the voting options and asking which demographic categories you fall into. One industry source described this method as “cheap and cheerful”. As the companies conducting this polling in 2019 relied on lists of voters’ landline numbers, there were concerns that it skewed towards older respondents, and therefore the data did not accurately reflect the diversity of the voting pool. Social researcher Rebecca Huntley says one of the problems in 2019 was that polling seemed to confirm what people already believed. “There was an accepted wisdom that the Labor party was going to win and it seemed to be confirmed by polling and a Liberal party in disarray,” Huntley says. But, she says, “the problems with polling in other democracies eventually crept up on Australia”. In response to the 2019 failures, the Australian Polling Council was established, with major players adhering to a code of conduct and agreeing to make their methodologies public – with the exception of Resolve, which is not a member of the council. National political polls published by newspapers have entirely moved away from robopolling, but otherwise the various companies have made different adjustments. Goot said there is now “a very big spread in methodologies”, particularly in how polls try to gauge voter intention. Peter Lewis, the executive director of Essential Media – which conducts polling published by Guardian Australia – agrees. “It’s a whole lot less monolithic now.” An example of this differentiation is the way undecided voters are surveyed. Most polls offer respondents some way of answering that they don’t know who they will vote for, with the exception of Resolve, which requires respondents to pick a candidate. While this is designed to simulate the decision they will have to make on election day, some observers question whether this accurately captures undecided voter sentiment, as respondents only get paid if they complete the survey. Some polls ask undecided voters a secondary question on how they are leaning, while others, such as the Guardian’s Essential poll, allow a respondent to complete the survey without making a choice. Essential polls reported by Guardian Australia no longer include undecided voters in a two-party-preferred score that adds up to 100, instead recording the parties’ share as, for example, 49% to 45%. The companies have also sought to account for other factors that may lead to errors, such as the underrepresentation of voters for minor parties (who more commonly decline to take part in polling), and assumptions about how preferences flow. Some polls have brought in quotas based on different demographics, such as socio-economic status, that they incorporate into samples. One of the latest innovations is YouGov’s “multi-level regression with post-stratification” (MRP). The results of the statistical technique, which surveyed about 19,000 voters and were published by News Corp, has given an insight into the intentions of voters in each of Australia’s 151 seats – a much more ambitious snapshot than other polls. The Australian newspaper reported on Wednesday that the poll showed Labor would win 80 seats, giving it an outright majority, and that the Liberals were on course to lose Goldstein, Kooyong, Chisholm and Higgins in Melbourne, and Reid, Robertson, Lindsay and Bennelong in New South Wales. Several of these, particularly Higgins and Bennelong, have not been considered likely Liberal losses by other national polls or political commentators. Goot says MRP is not solely polling, but a predictive model that relies on the sophisticated use of survey and demographic data about the “nature of the seat”. “While the 19,000 respondents to make seat-by-seat predictions is ridiculously small if you divide by 151 electorates, the MRP model gets a lot of data about each respondent,” he said. It then makes informed assumptions about the proportionality of their sentiment in the electorate based on 2016 census data and more recent data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, about factors such as homeownership, education level and religion. MRP was pioneered in the UK in 2017, and Goot says it has performed well there after an uncertain start. This is the first time MRP has been used in Australia. Huntley agrees there have been improvements, including the establishment of the polling council, greater transparency about questions and methods, and new methodology (such as MRP), but still sounds a note of caution. “These are some of the improvements, but we still need to come back to the fact that it is not definitive. We always have to have a modest approach to people’s expectations of polling.” “It may be that the result is largely what the polls said it would be – but that does not mean that polling is a crystal ball. It just means we did the best with the tools that we have.” Still, Huntley says, polls are a useful tool, particularly when combined with qualitative research, and in marginal seats. “Regardless of the [polling] results, it is unlikely, based on my qualitative research, that Scott Morrison is going to be returned as prime minister because of the palpable dislike of him,” she says. Experts broadly believe that nationwide two-party-preferred polling is a more reliable predictor of the election outcome and that individual seat polls can be fraught. Kevin Bonham, an electoral studies and scientific research consultant, says a constant problem for seat-specific polls is “demographic churn”, especially in inner-city seats, where there are “a lot of transient votes”. “They have a long history of being very badly polled,” Bonham says. Further complicating the reliability of individual seat polling is the involvement of independents, Bonham says. “Their support often snowballs towards the end of the campaign.” We can’t be sure, but the onus is partly on the public to know how to read them, Bonham says. “People don’t realise polls are snapshots, not forecasts – they’ve got predictive value but they change,” he says. “The only thing that is certain is that things will happen that can’t be predicted by the polls.” One other certainty is that the pollsters will be awaiting the outcome of the election more anxiously even than most voters, particularly those who have made confident claims for their improved methodologies and new methods such as MRP. “Pollsters this time around are terrified of getting the wrong result,” Goot says. “This election will really be a bit of a test as to which model is most accurate. A lot will be learned after election day.” The two-party preferred figure combines preferences to show which major party is ahead, such as Labor on 52% and Coalition on 48%, and will add up to 100. However, Goot says pollsters are at pains for the public to understand that a party winning this 2PP figure alone is not enough to predict an election winner, as winning the popular vote in Australia does not guarantee winning a 76 seat majority in the lower house. He and other pollsters the Guardian spoke to point to the election pendulum concept – which lists seats held by each major party based on marginality at the last election with the most marginal seats closest to the centre – as a better predictor. This election, Labor needs 51.8% of the two-party preferred vote – a universal swing of 3.3% toward the party compared with the 2019 election – to win the seven seats needed to govern in its own right. ABC election tsar Antony Green explains the pendulum is lopsided this election due to the strong margins the Coalition enjoys in some seats, because of Labor’s collapse in Queensland at the 2019 election, and the fact that swings to Labor in seats it already holds safely don’t help it claw back a parliamentary majority.",News/Australia news,Will Australia’s opinion polls be more accurate in 2022 than at the last election?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/will-australias-opinion-polls-be-more-accurate-in-2022-than-at-the-last-election
5/16/2022,"The federal government will spend $20m to buy out fisheries in Australia’s south-east in part because the climate crisis is affecting population numbers of some species, making current fishing levels unsustainable. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority will buy back vessel permits in the south-east trawl fishery, which is the largest commonwealth-managed fin fish fishery in Australia. It is the first time the authority has said it will conduct a buyout because of climate change and environmental factors, which are preventing the recovery of some populations. The government announced $24m in the March budget for a structural adjustment package for the fishery, the bulk of which is for the buyouts to try to ensure its long-term sustainability. The authority told a Senate hearing in April that it was particularly concerned about population numbers of four species – jackass morwong, redfish, john dory and silver trevally – whose numbers did not appear to be recovering despite being subject to low catch limits designed to address historic overfishing. The authority’s chief executive, Wez Norris, told the hearing that the large-scale closure of some operators was necessary, describing the magnitude of this step as “quite shocking”. The Greens healthy oceans spokesperson, Peter Whish-Wilson, said it marked “the first time we’re having a discussion about the impacts of climate change on fisheries and ultimately on exports and fishing communities”. “I think it’s long overdue because the climate impacts have been there for some time and there’s been a failure to acknowledge that in any formal sense,” he said. “To see a fishery essentially shut down over climate change, it’s a worrying precedent.” In the previous parliament, a Senate inquiry had been examining the management of quotas in Australia’s fishing industry. Whish-Wilson said he hoped the inquiry would continue in the next parliament and that it would explore both the planned buyouts in the south-east as well as any climate impacts that had already been quantified in Australia’s fisheries more broadly. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A spokesperson for the authority said the 57 permits in the south-east trawl fishery were all eligible for buyout and the process for that was being determined. The spokesperson said the eastern Australian current had been warming, extending further down the coast and persisting for longer, which had caused some subtropical species to extend their range farther south but also pushed the northern range of some cold-water species southwards. Very low catch limits for species such as redfish had been aimed at enabling stocks to rebuild but these “do not appear to be recovering as anticipated”. The population of jackass morwong had also shown accelerated declines even though catch limits had been lowered. “It is now clear that limiting the catch of some species has not enabled them to rebuild or is not slowing their rate of decline … and that other factors [such as climate change] are impacting fish stocks within the south-east trawl fishery,” the spokesperson said. The Australian Marine Conservation Society expressed concern that management practices within the fishery were also a factor, alongside climate change, in the decline of some fish species. The AMCS’s sustainable seafood program manager, Adrian Meder, said the south-east trawl fishery was one that had benefited from an earlier buyout in 2005-06 aimed at addressing declining populations. He said since that time measures that would have improved scrutiny and detected overfishing – such as cameras on boats – had still not been introduced in the fishery. “Taxpayers might feel better about another big payout for this fishery if that concrete action had been taken already,” Meder said. “Any payout now must come with immediate and effective reform of the fishery and how it operates in a rapidly changing climate.” The South East Trawl Fishing Association said the 2005 reforms had moved the fishery “into a situation where no fish stock has been experiencing overfishing since”. The association’s executive officer, Simon Boag, said despite this there had not been an average jackass morwong recruitment (the arrival of baby fish into the fishery) in more than a decade. He said the buyout was a “tough move” but rebuilding fish populations would require fewer vessels in the fishery. “The only thing we can control is how much fish we take, in this case the current adjustment does just that – it will significantly lower the catch of jackass morwong,” he said. The authority’s spokesperson said all commonwealth fisheries, including the south-east trawl fishery, were managed in accordance with the government’s harvest policy, which ensured catch limits were set in line with scientific advice. “Application of the harvest strategy policy has provided transparent, reliable and consistent decision making, providing high levels of confidence that fishing has been occurring at sustainable levels,” the spokesperson said.",News/Environment,Australian authorities to buy out fisheries citing climate crisis ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/16/australian-authorities-to-buy-out-fisheries-citing-climate-crisis
5/16/2022,"Of the more than 1,200 candidates in the federal election running for the House of Representatives, just 100 (8%) come from backgrounds other than Anglo-Australian, according to lists compiled by the Asian Australian Alliance and the Centre of Multicultural Political Engagement, Literacy and Leadership (Compell). There are a further 38 diverse candidates running for the Senate. According to a report from the Australian Human Rights Commission, 21% of Australians have a non-European background and 3% an Indigenous background. Over 300 ancestries were identified in the 2016 census. Less than 40% (458) of House candidates are women, with the majority of both diverse and female candidates running as challengers in safe or fairly safe seats. The most commonly self-identified occupations of House candidates – aside from existing members of parliament – are managers, retirees and businesspeople. Some unique occupations listed by only a single candidate include a showman, firearms dealer, humanitarian and a carbon farmer. Although the lists are largely crowdsourced via public statements and may not be comprehensive, as the Australian Electoral Commission does not release extensive data on candidates’ backgrounds, they nevertheless highlight a troubling lack of diversity in the electionwhich “is not representative of multicultural Australia”. Of the 100 House candidates identified as having backgrounds other than Anglo-Australian, just three are incumbents in safe seats: the Coalition’s Ian Goodenough and Labor’s Linda Burney and Peter Khalil. Labor’s Cassandra Fernando is contesting in Wills, where the incumbent Labor MP Anthony Byrne is retiring. The majority of diverse candidates identified (57%) are challengers in safe or fairly safe seats. There are five diverse candidates in marginal seats currently held by their parties, including Dave Sharma, Marion Scrymgour, Gladys Liu, Anne Aly and Ken Wyatt. Tharini Apolline Rouwette, the CEO of Compell, says the makeup of parliament and the candidates isn’t reflective of Australian society. “Our parliament is not representative of multicultural Australia, hence why we need diversity in parliament and also to normalise people of colour in leadership roles,” she says. “There’s about 4% of people of colour in parliament today which is hardly reflective of the Australian population that is increasingly becoming multicultural. The information collected, together with my follow-up surveys/interviews will hopefully be the beginning of a long journey towards collecting information that will inform us as to what we need to do to get more people of colour elected in government.” Men make up over 60% of the 1,204 candidates in the AEC list, according to data compiled by Ben Raue at the Tallyroom. There are four non-binary candidates and two whose gender is unknown. Both major parties have more male than female candidates, but a slightly higher percentage of Labor candidates are women. Women make up a disproportionate share of candidates in marginal seats – they represent 38% of all candidates, but 41.6% of candidates in marginal seats. Some 263 women (56%) are running as challengers in safe or fairly safe seats. Guardian Australia compiled a list of occupations from the AEC candidate list, identifying around 254 unique occupations – an approximation, since there can be a number of names for the same occupation, and some candidates wrote expansive job titles such as “finance” or “business”. Aside from member of parliament, lawyers, directors, consultants, managers, retirees and the unemployed are among the biggest occupations for candidates in the major parties. Some candidates who quit their jobs to contest the election are listed as unemployed. The most common occupations for Coalition members are lawyers and directors (nine each), followed closely by consultants and managers. Union officials and unemployed are the top occupations for Labor candidates. Students and retirees make up the top occupations for the Greens.

5/16/2022,"Sweden has indicated it will follow Finland in applying for Nato membership. The two countries’ move abandons decades of military non-alignment triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and would redraw the security map of Europe. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance would look to provide both countries with interim security guarantees while the applications are processed, including possibly by increasing troops in the region. In apparent retaliation, the Kremlin has pulled the plug on electricity supplies to Finland, with which it shares a 1,300km (800 mile) border. Nato pledged open-ended military support for Ukraine on Sunday. At a meeting of alliance foreign ministers in Berlin, Germany’s Annalena Baerbock said it would provide military assistance “for as long as Ukraine needs this support for the self-defence of its country”. British intelligence revealed that Russia may have lost as much as a third of the invasion force, as more than 400 Russian soldiers were estimated to have been killed or wounded last week trying to cross the Donets river. UK defence chiefs said Russia’s offensive in the eastern Donbas region had “lost momentum” and that Moscow’s battle plan was “significantly behind schedule”. Ukraine’s president Volodymr Zelensky has warned that the military situation in Ukraine’s south-eastern Donbas region is “very difficult” as analysts say Russian president Vladimir Putin has his sights on annexing southern and eastern Ukraine in the months ahead. Russia’s defence ministry claimed it had carried out “high-precision” missile strikes on four artillery munitions depots in the Donetsk area in the east of Ukraine. The ministry also claimed airstrikes had destroyed two missile-launching systems and radar, and 15 Ukrainian drones around Donetsk and Lugansk. As Russian forces struggle in Ukraine, Ukrainian forces made inroads. The first Ukrainian battalion reached the Russian border in the Kharkhiv region today.

5/16/2022,"Police leaders have accused Priti Patel of a “power grab” that would allow the home secretary to intervene in local law enforcement matters and silence chiefs who want to speak out on issues deemed politically sensitive. An extraordinary row has broken out behind the scenes, with police bosses accusing Patel of trying to obtain new powers without parliamentary approval. The vehement backlash from chief constables and police and crime commissioners (PCCs) comes after an attempt by the government to redraft a written protocol that tries to define where the responsibility lies in policing. Parts of the plan have been labelled “profoundly dangerous” anda “power grab threatening operational independence” by one chief constable. Police and crime commissioners, in a private response, described some of the government proposals as “ultra vires”, meaning going beyond the home secretary’s legal authority. The government handed powers over local policing to PCCs as part of its localism agenda a decade ago. But one government proposal makes it easier for the home secretary to intervene in such matters, while another increases the pressure on chiefs and PCCs to answer to the home secretary. A Home Office source with close knowledge of Patel’s thinking rejected the criticism. They said: “It is not a power grab, it is not a threat to operational independence, but making clear whose job and whose responsibility things are in the policing world. Should it not be the home secretary’s role to ask questions?” The row at the top of the criminal justice system in England and Wales centres on the Home Office’s attempt to revise the policing protocol, which was first produced in 2011 and came into force in January 2012. The Home Office draft of its new version, seen by the Guardian, was sent to chief constables and PCCs for their views, with consultation closing on 2 May. It sets out how the government, chief constables and police and crime commissioners should work together. It is widely agreed that, after a decade, updating the original version is a good idea. But the new draft protocol gives the home secretary the right to demand answers from chief constables, which PCCs believe impinges on their role. One chief constable said the protocol “expanded” the home secretary’s role beyond what is written in law. Another said: “It was your party that gave these powers away, if they don’t like it, take it back with legislation through parliament. A lot of chiefs believe the way it is written now is ultra vires. They are angry.” Since Patel became home secretary, her department has wanted more involvement in policing under a policy called “lean in”. The chief constable said: “They use the term leaning in. For the first time, the chiefs are leaning out.” A Home Office source said the changes made sense and expressed bafflement at the opposition. “We are going to write down more clearly whose job is what, who can ask for information and who can do various things,” they said. The 2012 version of the protocol made clear that the introduction of PCCs had “allowed for the Home Office to withdraw from day-to-day policing matters”. The new version, police leaders say, tries to claw back power without parliamentary approval, with Patel and her officials wanting to expand her “legitimate role in holding PCCs and CCs [chief constables] to account”, and thus make it easier to take police leaders to task. The proposed protocol says: “We propose to lower the threshold for home secretary intervention in appropriate circumstances. This would equip the home secretary to intervene earlier as required, thus reducing the risk of failing to deliver effective policing.” Government proposals would also increase pressure on police leaders to provide the home secretary with information that she asks for, which they are not obliged to do. The document says: “In order to ensure that the home secretary is equipped with the information required to respond to the public and parliament, PCCs and CCs should expect the home secretary to ask chief constables for information about policing matters.” In their private response, the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners said: “There is no formal statutory power for the home secretary to require the police and crime commissioner to give information … As such, any attempt to create a legal responsibility for police and crime commissioners to provide information to the home secretary through the protocol would be ultra vires.” Also in the proposed protocol is a demand that chief constables act “in a politically neutral manner”, which has been added to the previous stricture that they must be impartial. This is opposed by chief constables. One chief said they would be “fettered” and unable to comment on public policy that they believe may affect crime fighting – such as the effects of austerity. Another chief said it was so imprecise that they could not publicly speak out on issues of political dispute – such as tougher sentences or opposing the decriminalisation of cannabis, which is supported by some frontline politicians. The elected police and crime commissioners said such a “recentralisation” cannot be done through “amendments to the protocol”. Instead, they said: “Creation of new powers of strategic oversight can only be achieved through primary legislation and must be subject to the full scrutiny that is required of primary legislation.” In another section, they say, the “proposed change seeks to alter the constitutional relationship between the police, the people, and central government, which is one of the great strengths of British policing”. The deep misgivings come despite the protocol’s foreword giving this reassurance: “The protocol cannot create new law, provide actors with powers they do not already have, or take away the discretion of any relevant body to use their existing powers.” It adds: “By updating the protocol, we intend to bring greater clarity to the role of the home secretary in the policing landscape, as well as the role of chief constables, PCCs and police and crime panels.” In a separate development, Patel will announce in a letter to police forces on Monday that she is easing conditions on the use of stop and search powers under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act. Section 60 powers give officers the right to search people without reasonable grounds in an area when they expect serious violence, and to look for weapons before they can be used, or those used in a recent attack. The move effectively undoes limitations put in place in 2014. Changes include lowering the rank at which stop and search can be authorised, and extending the length of time the powers can be in force.",News/UK news,Priti Patel accused of ‘power grab’ over new policing proposals,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/15/priti-patel-accused-of-power-grab-over-new-policing-proposals
5/16/2022,"Children have become more sedentary and their physical activity levels have deteriorated in the wake of the pandemic even after the lifting of restrictions, a study suggests. Researchers said child physical activity levels fell below national guidelines during the Covid-19 crisis and did not recover when lockdowns ended. The UK’s chief medical officers recommend that all children and young people should take part in an hour of moderate to vigorous physical activity each day. However, the study led by the University of Bristol found that by the end of 2021, only a third were meeting the national recommended physical activity guidelines. While there was no change in their parents’ physical activity levels, the findings showed 10-11-year-olds took part in on average just 56 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity during weekdays from last April to December. Researchers said that was around eight minutes on average less – a drop of 13% – than children of a similar age were doing before the pandemic. It found children were less active at the weekend than during the week, taking part in 46 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity during weekend days. This was also about eight minutes lower than children who were measured using the same methods before the pandemic. The study also revealed a marked increase in sedentary time, with children spending 25 minutes longer sitting down each day during the week than previously. “It was surprising, the extent children’s physical activity levels had fallen after the pandemic, indicating that changes in physical activity patterns did not revert to previous levels once freedoms had been restored,” said the study’s senior author, Prof Russ Jago, of the University of Bristol. “These findings highlight a greater need to work with children, families, schools and communities to maximise the opportunities for children to be physically active as we emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic.” Nearly 400 children and their parents from 23 schools in Bristol were recruited for the study. They wore an accelerometer to measure the intensity of physical activity and answered questionnaires. This information was compared with data from 1,296 children and their parents recruited from 50 schools in the same area before the pandemic. “The key strength of this study was that we used data collected before and after the pandemic, using the same methods and in the same schools,” said Ruth Salway, a statistician at the University of Bristol. “The data clearly demonstrates children’s physical activity had deteriorated once the restrictions were lifted. “This emphasises the importance of understanding how such habits change over time, so appropriate support and interventions can be introduced as normality resumes.” The study, funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research, was published in the International Journal of Behavioural Nutrition and Physical Activity.",News/Society,Children’s activity levels have not recovered after end of Covid restrictions – study,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/16/childrens-activity-levels-have-not-recovered-after-end-of-covid-restrictions-study
5/16/2022,"The government is lifting restrictions placed on police stop and search powers in areas where they anticipate violent crime, the home secretary has announced. In a letter to police forces on Monday, Priti Patel outlined the easing of conditions on the use of the tactics under section 60 of the criminal justice and public order act. Section 60 powers give officers the right to search people without reasonable grounds in an area when they expect serious violence, and to look for weapons before they can be used or for those used in a recent attack. The limitations were put in place in 2014 by then home secretary Theresa May. Stop and search tactics are controversial because of concerns that they disproportionately affect black and minority ethnic communities, with campaign groups previously warning that relaxing the restrictions could compound discrimination. The changes extend the length of time the powers can be in force from 15 to 24 hours. The period a section 60 can be extended to is now 48 hours, having previously been 39 hours. The rank at which officers are able to authorise the deployment of stop and search has been lowered from senior officer to inspector, while a superintendent can now extend the authorisation. Authorising officers now only need to anticipate that serious violence “may” rather than “will” occur, and no longer need to publicly communicate authorisations to communities in advance. Patel said: “The devastating impact of knife crime on families who have lost their loved one is unbearable. No one should have to endure the pain and suffering of the victims of these appalling crimes and we have a responsibility to them to do everything in our power to prevent future tragedies.” She said the use of stop and search has increased by about 85% since 2019 and contributed to 50,000 weapons being taken off the streets. Patel added: “I stand wholeheartedly behind the police so that they can build on their work to drive down knife crime by making it easier for officers to use these powers to seize more weapons, arrest more suspects and save more lives.” Weyman Bennett, co-convenor of Stand Up To Racism, told the Guardian that this “draconian action” would lead to “unnecessary conflict”. “The restrictions were put in because two police reports found there was indiscriminate use [of stop and search] against black communities. Our civil rights are being eroded and thrown in the bin by Priti Patel,” he said. The move coincides with the launch of Operation Sceptre, a week of intensive action by every police force in England and Wales to tackle knife crime. The government has also launched a consultation to make it easier for officers to search known knife carriers. It comes after the introduction of serious violence reduction orders under the controversial police, crime, sentencing and courts act passed last month, which are intended to make such checks easier. The Home Office rolled back restrictions on the section 60 tactics in 2019 as part of an attempt to tackle knife crime. A report by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) watchdog last month urged an overhaul of the use of stop-and-search powers to tackle the disproportionate impact the measures have on ethnic minority groups. In the year to March 2021, black people were seven times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, while Asian people were two-and-a-half times more likely. The IOPC report cited allegations that one child was stopped 60 times. The Guardian reported that the male teenager was sometimes searched multiple times in the same day over two years, starting in 2018 when he was aged 14.",News/Law,Priti Patel lifts restrictions on police stop and search powers,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/may/16/restrictions-on-police-stop-and-search-powers-permanently-lifted
5/16/2022,"At least 239 barriers, including dams and weirs, were removed across 17 countries in Europe in 2021, in a record-breaking year for dam removals across the continent. Spain led the way, with 108 structures taken out of the country’s rivers. “Our efforts to expand dam removals across Europe are gathering speed,” said Pao Fernández Garrido, project manager for the World Fish Migration Foundation, who helped produce Dam Removal Europe’s annual report. “An increasing number of governments, NGOs, companies and communities are understanding the importance of halting and reversing nature loss, and buying into the fact that dam removal is a river-restoration tool that boosts biodiversity and enhances climate resilience. We’re also seeing lessons being learned from previous dam removals, new countries kickstarting removals, and new funds, including crowdfunding.” More than 1m barriers are estimated to exist on Europe’s rivers, with many built more than a century ago. At least 150,000 are old, obsolete barriers that serve no economic purpose. Dams, weirs and other river obstacles block fish migration routes, often leading to the loss of breeding areas and reduced numbers of species such as salmon, sturgeon, trout and eel, which affects the wider biodiversity of ecosystems, including species ranging from eagles to otters. Free-flowing rivers also transport sediments and nutrients. “Removing dams is a real need,” said Fernández Garrido. “We have hundreds of thousands of abandoned barriers, which is a safety problem. Dams affect water quality and underground water levels, cause channel and coastal erosion and beach disappearances, generate greenhouse gas emissions and lead to declines and even extinctions of migratory fish populations, with a 93% decline of migratory fish in Europe in the last 50 years. Dams have a negative impact on the environment, so if a dam or weir isn’t strictly necessary any more, we mustn’t pass the burden to future generations.” Dam Removal Europe is a coalition of seven organisations, including the World Fish Migration Foundation, WWF, the Rivers Trust and Rewilding Europe, working to restore healthy, free-flowing rivers across the continent. The latest report found that 76% of the removals were of small dams and weirs, but 24% were higher than 2 metres. Three countries – Portugal, Montenegro, and Slovakia – recorded their first ever dam removals in 2021. In Finland, a functioning hydropower dam was also dismantled, the first of three on the Hiitolanjoki River, which, when completed, is expected to allow landlocked salmon to return to spawning grounds. “This is the perfect example to show that when an operating hydropower dam isn’t needed, and energy can be supplied by other sources, it’s worth removing it and recovering the river,” said Fernández Garrido. “The river will be totally free of dams for the first time in over 120 years.” Spain removed 108 barriers from its rivers in 2021, including the 13m-high Anllarinos dam, the tallest European dam taken out last year. “Spanish law is one of the best for dealing with dams,” said Rafael Seiz from WWF-Spain’s Freshwater Programme. “Spain has legislation that obligates the owner to pay for its infrastructure removal once they stop using it.” “Spain, France, Denmark, Finland and the UK are blazing a trail,” said Fernández Garrido. “There are other countries that need to make strong efforts to start, such as Italy, Portugal and Greece, and almost all countries in eastern Europe, where many proponents of dam removals are still afraid to openly talk about it.” With dramatic declines in freshwater fish populations, restoring free-flowing rivers is seen as urgent. “We truly think 2022 will beat 2021, [because] financial aids are being created to help cover the removal costs, like the new Open Rivers Programme, which will invest €42.5m over the next six years to help remove river barriers in Europe,” said Fernández Garrido. “We really want to see governments from all countries taking action and creating national grants and plans to completely free some of their rivers from obstacles, so there is, at least, a free and healthy river per country. We’re talking about creating a big shift.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Record number of dams removed from Europe’s rivers in 2021 ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/16/record-number-of-dams-removed-from-europe-rivers-in-2021-aoe
5/16/2022,"A group of 58 leading economists and politicians, including the former business minister Vince Cable, has written to the chancellor to say that scaling back City regulation will put the UK at risk of another financial crash. The open letter, which has also been signed by the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis and Columbia University professor Adam Tooze, was sent in reaction to the Queen’s speech, which outlined Rishi Sunak’s plans to “cut red tape” through a financial services and markets bill. “We wholeheartedly support the government’s aim to stimulate long-term UK economic growth, including through financial regulation,” the letter said. “Yet we believe that competitiveness is an inappropriate objective for regulators.” News of the pending bill – which comes as the UK aims to replace EU regulations following Brexit – has stoked fears about a regulatory race to the bottom, with economists saying it could force watchdogs to act as “cheerleaders” for big city institutions. They argued that competitiveness objectives could be a “recipe for excessive risk-taking”, and could create the same conditions that have since been blamed for the 2008 banking crash. “After the last global financial crisis, which cost the world economy some $10tn, it was accepted that a focus on competitiveness by the then Financial Services Authority (FSA) had helped cause the disaster,” the letter said. They even pointed to a 2019 speech by Andrew Bailey – the Bank of England governor who formerly headed the FSA’s successor, the Financial Conduct Authority – in which he argued against reintroducing a competition objective for the City watchdog. “It didn’t end well for anyone, including the FSA,” Bailey said. Cable said in a statement: “It is extraordinary that the lessons of the financial crisis are being forgotten already, despite the massive harm that was done. The new emphasis on ‘competitiveness’ rather than stability and safety is an ominous warning that those who forget their history are doomed to repeat it.” The pending bill is part of the government’s response to pressure from lobby groups including UK Finance, TheCityUK and the City of London Corporation, which were broadly opposed to Brexit but have yet to see any of the benefits promised by pro-leave politicians. City groups have, for example, been pushing for a review of capital requirements for insurers and banks that could help free up cash for new investments and loans, and make it cheaper to take riskier bets, since they would have to hold less capital to protect against potential losses. That is on top of pushes to make changes to a wide-ranging package of regulations known as Mifid II. There are calls for firms to be allowed to bundle customer charges, and for the permanent removal of caps on “dark trading” – which obscure the size of planned trades but can give investors access to better market prices. Some are calling for a review of UK-specific rules like ringfencing – which require banks to protect consumer deposits by separating their retail and investment banking operations – as well as reducing the time it takes to secure regulatory approval for company directors, and simplifying regulation for challenger banks. The Treasury has not yet confirmed the main policies that will make up the financial services and markets bill, which is expected to be put to parliament in the coming months, but has pushed back against claims that it will result in a watering-down of regulation. Miles Celic, chief executive of the TheCityUK, defended the reintroduction of competitiveness objectives for regulators, saying other countries like Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore had managed to strike a balance with other goals such as financial stability and consumer protection. Celic said: “It is self-evident that high-quality, well-implemented and effective regulatory standards are clearly good for competitiveness and economic growth, and so there is no contradiction between an effective regulatory regime and the proposed new secondary competitiveness objective.” A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “We want to ensure the financial services sector is delivering for businesses and consumers across the UK, while also cementing our position as a global leader and promoting high international standards. “Now we have left the EU, it is right that the regulators’ objectives reflect financial services’ critical role in supporting the economy, making the UK an even more attractive place to invest and do business.”",News/Business,"Cutting City regulation risks another financial crash, say economists",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/cutting-city-regulation-financial-crash-economists-rishi-sunak-uk
5/16/2022,"Bereaved relatives of those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire and the community living in its shadow are struggling to agree on the best way to commemorate the disaster. Next month marks five years since a fire engulfed the tower block in North Kensington, west London, killing 72 people. A memorial garden is “by far” the most popular option to commemorate the tragedy, according to a report published on Monday by the Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission. However, it stresses that there are “very different views” on the best tribute, with the remains of the tower itself proving most controversial. The block is currently covered in green safety wrapping, with the message “Forever in our hearts”. What to do with it remains painfully divisive. “Some bereaved families have asked us to stress the deep pain and sorrow that would be felt if the tower was to come down – and the fury that would be unleashed if this happened without them being properly consulted with,” the report said. It added: “A large number of people – particularly those living and working in the local community – tell us that living with the tower places a huge strain on their mental health.” Parents are particularly concerned about the impact of this on children. Ideas from bereaved families include a museum to commemorate lost relatives, a sky garden and maintaining the charred remains of the tower as a memorial. “Even with the best will in the world and all the imagination we can muster, we know that some painful choices lie ahead,” the commission wrote. The government will decide if the tower comes down, the report said, but if it does, materials from it will be made available for use in the memorial if that is what the community requests. About 2,000 people were surveyed for the report, including about 100 bereaved family members and survivors. Almost two-thirds said they would like the memorial to include a garden, a third would like it to feature artwork or a monument and one in 10 wanted to incorporate a building such as a museum. The commission put its work on hold last September after an article in the Sunday Times said ministers were set to announce the demolition of the tower. The commissioners said they were “shocked, dismayed and completely blindsided” by it and did not resume their work until January this year after reassurances from Michael Gove that he would listen to the community. The commission is co-chaired by solicitor Thelma Stober, who was injured in the 7/7 terrorist attacks, and Michael Lockwood a senior civil servant who ran the response in the aftermath of the fire. He is now director general of the Independent Office for Police Conduct. In a joint statement, they said: “Our role is to ensure that what happened at Grenfell is never forgotten … Today’s report is a huge step forward. It reflects the incredible amount of work undertaken by all of the community representatives on the Memorial Commission, and of all the bereaved families, survivors and local residents involved over the past two years.” The commission will make final recommendations next year. A covenant will protect the site from any use which goes against the community’s wishes. Yvette Williams, one of the organisers of the Justice4Grenfell group, said she was sceptical that the consultation would be listened to by the government. “What evidence do we have to trust the government that they will deliver on what the bereaved families want?” she said. A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: “We are committed to supporting the Memorial Commission and the community as they develop their vision for a fitting memorial to those who lost their lives in the Grenfell Tower tragedy.”",News/UK news,‘Painful choices’ remain over tribute to Grenfell Tower victims,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/painful-choices-remain-over-tribute-to-grenfell-tower-victims
5/16/2022,"The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, will release a $173bn balance-of-power wishlist at the party’s campaign launch in Brisbane on Monday night, outlining seven key concessions it wants from Labor in the event of a minority government. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has ruled out doing any deals with the Greens to form government, while Bandt has said the party will not support the Liberals under any circumstance. But the Greens are preparing their list of key demands for Labor in the event that it falls short of the 76 seats it needs to form majority government, with the party confident of winning at least one seat in Queensland to give it two lower house MPs. The party’s seven key demands are no new coal and gas; dental and mental health into Medicare; building 1m affordable homes and better renters’ rights; free childcare; wiping student debt; lifting income support; and progress on all elements of the Uluru statement from the heart. The cost of the policy demands is about $173bn over four years but the Greens are also advocating $182bn in new revenue and savings measures to cover the cost, including through a “super profits” tax, a billionaires tax, a crackdown on corporate tax avoidance and ending fossil fuel subsidies. Bandt will release the party’s demands at a campaign launch at the BlackHops Brewery on Monday in the Brisbane electorate of Griffith, which is held by Labor’s Terri Butler on a 2.8% margin. The Greens are hoping they can secure a win in Griffith and are also eyeing off the Coalition-held seats of Ryan (6%) and Brisbane (4.9%) as possible gains. Labor is also hoping to pick these seats off the Coalition. The Greens candidate for Griffith, Max Chandler-Mather, secured 23.6% of the vote when he ran in 2019 and the party is confident it can build upon this 6.6% swing at Saturday’s election. Bandt predicted a close result on election night that could put the Greens in the box seat, and said voters “deserve to know what will be on the negotiating table”. “This election has become a narrow contest between a terrible government that’s got to go and a visionless opposition that keeps agreeing with them,” he said. “The Greens will kick the Liberals out and keep Labor on track.” He said the party would tackle the climate crisis by stopping new coal and gas mines, and address the rising cost of living by getting dental and mental health into Medicare, building affordable housing and making childcare free. Bandt said expanding Labor’s childcare policy to make it free for everyone would cost up to $3bn more than its existing policy. Labor has not released full costings of its childcare proposal but it is estimated to be between $5.4bn and $6.3bn a year. The Greens childcare policy is costed at about $8.3bn a year. “The Greens also want action for First Nations people, including a Truth and Justice Commission to begin acknowledging the violence and dispossession of this land’s first peoples, as well as progress towards a Treaty, to complement Labor’s commitment to progress the Voice to Parliament,” Bandt said.

5/16/2022,"The Coalition has conceded its plan to allow first homebuyers access to superannuation will push up prices, as industry super and progressive thinktanks warned it could add tens of thousands to the cost of a home. The policy, unveiled at the Coalition launch on Sunday, to allow first homebuyers access to up to $50,000 of retirement savings has prompted warnings that house prices in Sydney could increase by as much as $134,000. The scheme has already been rubbished by Labor and the former prime minister Paul Keating, the architect of Australia’s compulsory super system, setting up a major policy fight in the last week of the federal election campaign. Scott Morrison defended the policy in a round of interviews on Monday morning, arguing it would help first homebuyers get off “the sidelines where they see house prices go up” but would not hurt their super balances because the investment in the home would go back in after it was sold. But the superannuation minister, Jane Hume, told Radio National there would likely be “a bump in house prices” in the short term, as “a lot of people bring forward their decision to buy a house”. At a doorstop in the Queensland Labor seat of Blair, Morrison claimed that the price impact of the policy would be “marginal” but ignored calls to release modelling underpinning the claim. Morrison said the Property Council had “disagreed with some of those analyses that others have done”. “I simply don’t agree with the assertion [prices will rise],” he said. Earlier, Morrison told ABC Brisbane the government is aiming to “minimise” any potential price impact with supply-side policies aimed to encourage older Australians to downsize house and limits on how much super can be withdrawn. Labor’s housing spokesman, Jason Clare, seized on Hume’s admission and claimed the Coalition policy would increase house prices. He called the policy proposal “the last desperate act of a dying government”. “It just pushes prices up,” he told ABC News Breakfast. “If they really thought this was a good idea, do you think they would plant it six days before an election? They have been in office for almost a decade.” Labor’s superannuation spokesman, Stephen Jones, tweeted that the policy would “blow up the housing market in Australia”. Under the policy homebuyers at any income level will be able to access 40% of their super, up to a maximum of $50,000, to buy a property that must be owner-occupied, provided they have already saved a 5% deposit. In January the McKell Institute modelled the impact of allowing prospective homebuyers access to superannuation in conjunction with researchers from the Centre for Housing, Urban and Regional Planning at the University of South Australia. They found allowing access to $40,000 from super would encourage the take-up of $73.6bn in new housing debt as renters entered the market to buy, causing a one-off price surge in the first year of the policy. The biggest price impact would be in Brisbane, where the median house price was estimated to rise $99,346, followed by Hobart ($92,796), Adelaide ($84,534), Perth ($57,413) and Sydney ($45,342). The report also concluded that “given the historical stronger performance of super compared to real housing market returns, the effect of compounding over a long time period (30 years) means that individuals accessing super for housing are likely to end up financially worse off in the end”. Industry Super Australia estimated the effect could be even larger, basing its predictions on a model of pent-up demand for homes and the observed take-up of the previous early super release scheme during the pandemic. It found that allowing couples to take up to $40,000 from super could push prices in Sydney up by 16%, adding $134,000 to the median price; Perth by 14%, adding $60,000; Darwin by 10%, adding $45,000; and Melbourne by 9%, adding $55,000. The ISA chief executive, Bernie Dean, said: “Throwing super into the housing market would be like throwing petrol on a bonfire – it will jack up prices, inflate young people’s mortgages and add to the aged pension, which taxpayers will have to pay for.” The McKell Institute’s executive director, Michael Buckland, said the data showed the policy amounted to a further intergenerational transfer of wealth from young people to existing, older homeowners. “What first homebuyers desperately need is a little calm in the overheated housing market,” he said. “This proposal would kickstart yet another house price spiral, stripping young people of their super savings and doing virtually nothing to improve real affordability.” Earlier, Morrison told Channel Seven’s Sunrise the policy would “absolutely not” run down workers’ super, and they “may well have more” retirement savings because the initial investment and a portion for any capital gain “goes back into their super” if they sell. The prime minister accused Labor of opposing the policy because “they don’t treat super like it is your money”. “It’s your money, you earned it and saved it … and we want to help you get into your own home without impacting on your long-term superannuation.” On Sunday the assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, argued the policy was “calibrated at a level that’s not going to have a material impact, but it will help people buy their first home”. Asked if prices would surge, Sukkar told Sky News: “No, not in a material way because when you look at the size of the Australian housing market – $9.9tn – you look at the number of first-homebuyers there are a year and there are about 100,000, about a third of all new homes or less than a third of all new homes.” Clare also noted many young people hoping to buy their first home may not have much in their superannuation account to withdraw. “The average person in their 20s has only got about $20,000 in their super. Some of them less,” he said.",News/Australia news,Coalition minister concedes plan to allow first homebuyers to access super will push up house prices ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/coalition-plan-to-allow-first-homebuyers-to-access-super-will-jack-up-house-prices
5/16/2022,"Failure to act on the promises made at the Glasgow Cop26 climate summit last year would be “an act of monstrous self-harm”, the UK’s president of the conference will warn today in Glasgow. Alok Sharma, the cabinet minister who led the UK-hosted summit that ended with agreement to limit global heating to 1.5C, will say that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and rising energy and food prices, have changed the global outlook drastically in the six months since. But responding to those changes by reneging on climate commitments would only result in worse damage, he will say. “The current crises should increase, not diminish, our determination to deliver on what we agreed here at Cop26, and honour the Glasgow climate pact,” he is expected to say. “[World leaders must show that] though the world has changed, our resolve has not.” Sharma is returning to Glasgow on Monday to mark six months since Cop26 ended. Nearly 200 countries have agreed to develop new commitments this year to cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with the 1.5C goal, which requires roughly halving carbon levels by 2030, according to scientific advice from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Though Cop26 made important progress – all the world’s big economies have now committed to net-zero goals, compared with a handful before the UK took on its Cop26 role – it fell short of producing national plans, called nationally determined contributions (NDCs), that add up to the 2030 target. But countries agreed to return this year to the Cop27 conference in Egypt in November with strengthened commitments. Sharma urged countries to “pick up the pace” and make fresh commitments in line with stark warnings from the IPCC in new reports published this spring, and after recent extreme weather such as the heatwaves that have struck India and Pakistan. “The window of time we have to act is closing fast [and] we must urgently adapt and reduce emissions, because current targets are not enough,” he will warn. “Every country must respond to the call to revisit and strengthen their NDCs, and they must do so in 2022. The Glasgow pact calls on countries to look again at their NDCs, not at some vague point in the future, but this year, in 2022,” he will say. Many climate experts have told the Guardian they are concerned that the war in Ukraine, soaring prices for energy and food, and governments responding by increasing fossil fuel production, are imperilling the Cop26 promises. The Guardian has also uncovered evidence of nearly 200 “carbon bombs” – oil, gas and coal mega-projects, proposed or under way – that would destroy any chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Experts have warned that the answer to these crises is to move much faster away from fossil fuels. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said: “I believe we have the chance to make this a historic turning point, towards a cleaner and more secure energy system.” Failure to cut emissions will result in some of the world’s biggest cities running out of water, a report from the charity Christian Aid warned on Monday. London, Sydney, Beijing, Cairo, Cape Town and Phoenix are all in danger of running out of water as the climate crisis takes hold, according to the report, entitled Scorched Earth: the impact of drought on 10 world cities. Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, who studied the 2018 drought in Cape Town, warned: “Changing rainfall and higher temperatures – the result of greenhouse gas emissions – are making drought more common and more severe in parts of the world. As we saw in Cape Town, this can add up to catastrophic water shortages even for some major cities.” Nushrat Rahman Chowdhury, co-author of the Christian Aid report, said: “Drought is not new, but its intensity and frequency have increased over the last 30 years due to global warming. It is a real danger; it threatens lives and livelihoods of some of the poorest people in the world, who have done the least to cause the climate crisis.”",News/Environment,"Breaking climate vows would be ‘monstrous self-harm’, warns Cop26 president",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/15/breaking-climate-vows-would-be-monstrous-self-harm-warns-cop26-president

Liverpool’s FA Cup victory on Saturday ensured that, at the age of 23 years and 219 days, Alexander-Arnold has won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Club World Cup and Uefa Super Cup. Alexander-Arnold is the sixth player to complete that sextuple after Ryan Giggs, Denis Irwin, James Milner, César Azpilicueta and Andreas Christensen.

You see legendary players who do that and you think it is unbelievable. To be able to say I have done that at such a young age is a dream come true and it is motivation to go on and carry on winning more trophies. “Hopefully there is a lot more to come. The motivation is to win them all again and keep winning and keep adding to the trophy cabinet. “Days like Saturday help me.

I will keep my head down, try and win more trophies and hopefully at the end of my career I can be proud of what I have done.” The FA Cup triumph against Chelsea also completed the set for Jürgen Klopp, who became the first manager in Liverpool’s rich history to win the European Cup, league title, FA Cup and League Cup. Liverpool could yet add the Premier League and Champions League to this season’s trophy haul and Alexander-Arnold credited a fellow member of the sextuple club, Milner, with maintaining high standards inside the dressing room. “He is someone who keeps us all on our toes, he is massive in that dressing room,” Alexander-Arnold said of the 36-year-old, who is out of contract this summer but has been offered a one-year extension by Liverpool. “He is one of the biggest characters I have been around and it is credit to him. “It is no surprise he has carried on winning everywhere he goes because he is relentless in what he does. He instils that mentality in us and he embodies that. Five years ago if anyone had told me I would achieve what I have achieved I don’t know what I would have said. It is very special and, hopefully, in five more years I am in an even better place than I am now. It has not gone too bad so far. Five or 10 years’ time and we will hopefully be talking about bigger and better things.” Liverpool have won three consecutive finals against Chelsea on penalty shootouts and with a different goalkeeper in each one – Alisson in the FA Cup, Caoimhin Kelleher in the Carabao Cup and Adrián in the 2019 Super Cup. “Three different goalkeepers, three times winners. I said that in the changing room,” the goalkeeping coach, John Achterberg, said. “That is what you want. You need a little bit of luck as well as hard work. It makes all our day.” Achterberg described Alisson’s performance at Wembley as “outstanding, awesome”. Klopp dedicated the trophy to neuro11, the company which has worked with Liverpool for the past year on penalty technique, but the goalkeeping coach insists ultimate responsibility for the team’s spot-kick success remains with the players. “We work on things but in the end Ali makes the final decision,” Achterberg said. “We discuss everything. They have all been practising a lot on penalties this season. Obviously the guys from Germany came to work with them specifically, but more and more players have been practising after training and getting confidence. It is a big credit to them all because it is big pressure to take one. You win as a team. We analyse all these things and there is a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes.”",Sport/Football,Alexander-Arnold hungry for more Liverpool silverware after historic feat,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/alexander-arnold-hungry-for-more-liverpool-silverware-after-historic-feat
5/16/2022,"Mikel Arteta denies trying to manufacture a “them against us” culture inside the Arsenal dressing room as they look to secure the two wins that would guarantee a return to Champions League football, and claims he offered no complaints about the refereeing calls made during Thursday’s damaging derby defeat to Spurs. Arsenal’s result at Newcastle on Monday night will determine whether they enter the final day of the season with their fate in their own hands. A win will mean three points against Everton secure a place among the elite; anything else will hand Spurs a similar advantage when they travel to Norwich. Arteta was seething after the 3-0 north London derby loss, making perfectly clear his belief Paul Tierney’s first-half decisions to award Tottenham a penalty and dismiss Rob Holding were incorrect and had cost Arsenal the game; it seemed an attempt to foster a bunker mentality, at least to some extent, but he claims excuses are not his style. “What I have tried to do in [two and a half] years here is not make any complaints,” he said. “I have no complaint and I didn’t complain on Thursday. I just said I could not give a clear assessment on what I thought about the game, and that’s it.” In reality Arteta’s post-match comments at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – “If I say what I think I am suspended for six months” – said more than enough and there is a sense in some quarters that Arsenal are at times too happy to linger on perceived injustices. “Whatever we do, we will try to defend the club in the right way, like we have always tried to do,” he said. “The other night I tried to do it as well … I was being clear and honest. I think that is my job and my responsibility, when I talk on behalf of the club, to express how we feel. And if I cannot do it, I prefer not to.” Arsenal will wait nervously on the fitness of their first-choice centre-backs, Ben White and Gabriel Magalhães. White seems likely to start after making the bench at Spurs, having recovered from a hamstring problem; Gabriel hobbled off late on and his involvement will be a late call. Europa League football is at least guaranteed for next season and, after a year away from continental competition, fifth place would still constitute good progress for Arteta’s side. However, he would not countenance celebrating such an outcome. “No, we want to be playing in the Champions League,” he said. “We’ve come so far, it’s in our hands and we want to now capitalise on that, and the excitement and the opportunities there. We will really want to go for it.”",Sport/Football,Mikel Arteta denies creating ‘them against us’ culture at Arsenal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/mikel-arteta-denies-creating-them-against-us-culture-at-arsenal
5/16/2022,"Andreas Christensen limited Chelsea’s defensive options in the FA Cup final by making himself unavailable for selection on the day of the game. Christensen, who is poised to join Barcelona on a free transfer at the end of the season, was a surprise absentee from the squad that lost on penalties against Liverpool at Wembley on Saturday. He was not carrying an injury and told Thomas Tuchel of his decision on Saturday morning. It is understood that he had not been feeling well during the week and informed Chelsea’s head coach that he was not ready to play. Christensen had managed to start Chelsea’s win against Leeds last Wednesday. Tuchel made no mention of the centre-back being injured before or after the Liverpool game. Christensen’s teammates were said to be shocked and confused when the Denmark international left the team hotel. It is unclear if Christensen was going to start against Liverpool, though sources suggested he was going to be a substitute. But if he had not started the final he would have been a candidate to come off the bench at Wembley after Thiago Silva sustained an early injury. Silva soldiered on and finished the game but the 37‑year‑old was walking with a heavy limp as he exited Wembley. Tuchel will have a chance to talk about Christensen before Chelsea, whose defence will be weakened further when Antonio Rüdiger joins Real Madrid, face Leicester on Thursday. Last week, though, the club’s head coach admitted the Dane’s decision to join Barça has affected his form. Christensen was substituted at half-time during Chelsea’s defeats by Real Madrid and Arsenal last month, and he has been in an awkward position after talks over a contract extension hit a dead end earlier this season. Chelsea twice had verbal agreements with Christensen for a new deal, only for the defender to change his mind on both occasions. The player later hired new representatives, who wanted to start negotiations from scratch. Chelsea’s board took a different view. The situation has not gone down well at Stamford Bridge. But there is no bitterness towards Rüdiger, even though the Germany centre-back is also leaving on a free. The feeling is that Rüdiger, who has agreed a four-year deal with Madrid, has not messed Chelsea around. He had another fine game against Liverpool. Rüdiger made it clear after the Wembley defeat that the sanctions imposed on Roman Abramovich had nothing to do with his decision to move to the Bernabéu. Chelsea offered the 29-year-old player, who earns around £90,000 a week, £230,000 a week to stay and would have made him the highest paid defender in the club’s history. But the negotiations broke down when Chelsea received a request for a signing‑on bonus and large fees for the player’s representatives. Talks could not resume after Abramovich was hit with sanctions. Yet Rüdiger suggested Chelsea had a chance of keeping him. “I don’t want to go too deep into things,” he said. “There was a chance. But sanctions is not the reason.” Losing Rüdiger and Christensen is a huge blow. Chelsea, who could also allow César Azpilicueta to join Barcelona, may need to bring in two centre-backs this summer. They have looked at Sevilla’s Jules Koundé, Atlético Madrid’s José María Giménez, Leicester’s Wesley Fofana and RB Leipzig’s Josko Gvardiol. Strengthening the defence will be a major priority for Todd Boehly once his consortium has bought the club from Abramovich. Tuchel met Boehly for the first time last Thursday but is yet to talk to the American about transfers. “We had lunch together but it was in the room where everybody was, like players and staff,” Tuchel said. “He was very friendly, very open and it was a very informal meeting over lunch. It was like half an hour, 40 minutes, so it was not too detailed. It was just to get a feeling and say hello, and we talked more about baseball and basketball actually. It was not the moment. We will do this in the next weeks.” Chelsea must make decisions over Jorginho and N’Golo Kanté, with both midfielders out of contract next year, while there are doubts over Romelu Lukaku’s future. Tuchel admitted that it will be difficult for Chelsea to catch up with Liverpool and Manchester City this summer. “It’s maybe impossible, I have to say,” he said. “They are improving their squad in every transfer window. It seems like we are losing key players. We are losing Toni, we’re losing Andreas. This is tough and we already have a gap to close.” Tuchel defended Mason Mount after the midfielder missed the decisive penalty in the shootout. “The penalty will change nothing on my opinion about Mason. He is a key figure in this squad. He is a super nice guy and we don’t start doubting now because he misses a penalty.”",Sport/Football,Andreas Christensen made himself unavailable for Chelsea at FA Cup final ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/andreas-christensen-made-himself-unavailable-for-chelsea-at-fa-cup-final
5/16/2022,"An 18-year-old white man opened fire at a Buffalo, New York supermarket on Saturday, killing 10 people and wounding three others in what authorities have described as a “hate crime and racially motivated violent extremism”. Eleven of the 13 victims were Black, and two were white. Authorities said that the shooter, who is white, drove to Tops Friendly Market around 2.30pm, “allegedly wearing tactical gear and armed with an assault weapon”. When the shooter arrived, he shot four people outside the grocery, three of whom died, local prosecutors said. He then entered the supermarket, where a security guard, who had recently retired from the Buffalo police department, tried to stop him. The guard died in the exchange, and the shooter shot eight additional people inside the store, six of whom died, authorities said. The attacker was arraigned on a first-degree murder charge hours later, authorities said. Here is what we know about the victims so far. Salter, a retired Buffalo police lieutenant, was working as a security guard at Tops on Saturday when the shooter entered the grocery. Salter shot at the shooter in an effort to stop him, but was fatally wounded, according to WHIO TV. “One of the individuals inside the store is a security guard, a beloved security guard, who is a retired Buffalo police officer – a hero in our eyes – he engaged the suspect and fired multiple shots,” Buffalo’s police commissioner, Joseph Gramaglia, reportedly said at a press conference. Salter was 55, WHIO said. The 86-year-old had just visited her husband at his nursing home when she decided to pick up food at Tops, WGRZ reported. Whitfield is the mother of Buffalo’s former fire commissioner, Garnell Whitfield. “She was a religious woman who cared deeply for her family,” her daughter-in-law, Cassietta Whitfield, told The New York Times. “She’ll be truly missed.” Ruth Whitfield, a mother of four and grandmother of eight, called Buffalo home for more than 50 years. Cassietta Whitfield described her as a devout parishioner of the Durham Memorial A.M.E. Zion church. Ruth Whitfield sang in the choir, The Times reported. The Buffalo News identified one of the victims as Katherine Massey, reporting that a family member confirmed her death. She went to Tops to buy groceries, the newspaper reported. Massey’s sister, Barbara Massey, said in a text to a reporter: “She was a beautiful soul.” Betty Jean Grant, a former Eerie county legislator, said that 72-year-old Massey was a civil rights an education advocate. Less than one year ago, Massey wrote a letter to the newspaper calling for more federal gun regulations. “There needs to be extensive federal action/legislation to address all aspects of the issue,” Massey wrote. “Current pursued remedies mainly inspired by mass killings – namely, universal background checks and banning assault weapons – essentially exclude the sources of our city’s gun problems. Illegal handguns, via out of state gun trafficking, are the primary culprits.” The New York Times reported that Roberta Drury, 32, was among those killed at the Tops supermarket. Amanda Drury, her sister, told the newspaper that she was going to the store to buy supplies for dinner. “She was very vibrant,” Amanda Drury reportedly said. “She always was the center of attention and made the whole room smile and laugh.” For 25 years, 77-year-old Pearly Young ran a food pantry in Buffalo’s Central Park neighborhood, WGRZ reported. The shooter killed Young as she was shopping for groceries. Young, who fed the needy every Saturday, was a “mother, grandmother, and missionary,” the news station said. Patterson routinely gave people rides to the supermarket, and assisted them in carrying their groceries, the New York Times said. His great niece, Teniqua Clark, confirmed to the newspaper that he was fatally shot. The family of Celestine Chaney has identified her as one of the 10 people killed, according to the New York Times. Chaney’s son, Wayne Jones, told the newspaper that his mother was visiting her sister. Chaney wanted strawberry shortcake, so they went to Tops for the ingredients. “She loved those,” he said. Chaney’s sister got to the freezer, “but my mom cannot really walk like she used to,” Jones reportedly said. “She basically can’t run.” This is a developing story and will be updated accordingly.",News/US news,Buffalo shooting: what we know about the victims so far,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/15/buffalo-shooting-what-we-know-about-the-victims
5/16/2022,"Boris Johnson is poised to give the green light to controversial legislation on the Northern Ireland protocol this week as he flies to Belfast for crunch meetings, gambling that the move will restart stalled talks. The prime minister warned that it was a “necessity to act” if negotiations with the EU did not resume and said new measures would be put to parliament in the coming days. It comes as it emerged that business leaders in Northern Ireland have urged Johnson not to take any unilateral action in a private letter to Downing Street. A source confirmed that the letter from the Northern Ireland business Brexit working group, an umbrella organisation of 14 business bodies, told the prime minister there was the prospect of a deal with the EU. “It was being suggested that action was needed because business groups asked for it and trade was suffering because of the protocol. We asked them specifically not to launch unilateral action. We do not need the nuclear option when we believe there is still a prospect of a deal,” said the source. They said that it was astonishing that Johnson was flying to Northern Ireland threatening unilateral action and not meeting the group, despite their pleas, adding that the government had shown scant interest in business – with one 15-minute Zoom call with Liz Truss in January and no engagement since. The business working group – which includes the Confederation of British Industry, the NI Food and Drink Association, the Ulster Farmers Union, Manufacturing NI, Hospitality Ulster, the Institute of Directors NI, Logistics UK and the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium – is reportedly perplexed by statements from government listing issues that have already been resolved or which are close to being resolved. Amid frayed relations between the prime minister and Truss, Johnson will emphasise the need for restrained language to his foreign secretary. However, he is still set to sign off her preferred tactic for new legislation which would override parts of the protocol to remove checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. Truss has prepared a bill giving the government the right to suspend elements of the Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland, a move which the EU has warned could spark a trade war. Measures in the bill are expected to include a new “green lane” for goods for sale only in Northern Ireland and stronger penalties for those smuggling into the EU via the Republic. Ahead of crunch talks with parties at Stormont, Johnson said the circumstances had fundamentally changed since the deal was signed. “It was designed in the absence of a trade and cooperation agreement and when it was unclear one would be agreed. It has not been adapted to reflect the realities of the TCA. “It was designed before a global pandemic and a European war which has created a cost of living crisis on a scale not seen for half a century.” Johnson said in the op-ed for the Belfast Telegraph that there could not “even be a question” about the fast availability of medicines in Northern Ireland nor was it fair that the chancellor could not grant people in Northern Ireland the same tax and VAT benefits.” He said negotiations remained at an impasse while the EU claimed it was “impossible to make the changes to the protocol text to actually solve these problems in negotiations – because there is no mandate to do so.” One official said they expected the time frame for the new legislation to be decelerated to allow diplomatic efforts to resume. Another Whitehall official acknowledged the legislation was “several weeks away” from being formally put to MPs. Dozens of Conservative MPs have suggested they would vote against a bill in its later stages. A Whitehall source said they acknowledged the internal briefing war of the past week, which included cabinet splits and threw the internal choreography in crisis, had been unhelpful with a decades-old peace process at stake. “The priority tomorrow is to calm things down,” they said. The source suggested Johnson would tell Truss to handle things more delicately. Sources close to Truss have denied her team leaked details of the planned legislation and say they have not been responsible for some of the more inflammatory rhetoric – which they claim has irritated the foreign secretary. “The ideal solution is that we work through the problems with the protocol with the EU and through a negotiated solution and get the executive back up and running,” a government source said. “If they are not willing to show flexibility it’s our responsibility as a government to look at other options. [Truss] does favour looking at legislation as a way of doing that. But there is a difference between giving ourselves the powers to do something and then actually doing something.” No 10 said it was Johnson’s priority to restore the conditions for negotiations – claiming he had a “conciliatory” call with Ireland’s taoiseach last week. However, the Irish Times on Saturday reported sources describing it as “the single worst call he [Martin] has ever had with anyone”. Johnson is expected to meet the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Féin in Belfast on Monday. The DUP blocked the election of a speaker at Stormont on Friday, meaning the assembly is unable to function after the elections where Sinn Féin became the largest party. Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill who is first minister designate, said she would warn Johnson that any unilateral action to walk away from the protocol would be “reckless” and “deepen political instability”. “Any threat of unilateral action by the British government to denounce the withdrawal agreement, or disapply the protocol would be reckless. Walking away from international obligations would also represent an appalling attack on the international rule of law,” she said. “Only through joint agreement with the EU can solutions to problems or concerns be resolved. I will be telling Boris Johnson that unilateral action deepens political instability and economic uncertainty and must not happen.” On Sunday the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said the UK had “the right to act in a sovereign way” and to “reopen or re-examine the protocol” but he denied the actions would constitute a breach of international law. Johnson has previously vowed not to scrap the protocol and said he is only seeking reform that has “the broadest possible cross-community support”. Simon Coveney, Ireland’s foreign minister, “criticised sabre-rattling and grandstanding” from ministers over the past week. Johnson has already been told that dozens of Conservative MPs would attempt to stop the bill from becoming law if it reaches the later stages – though many see it as a negotiating tactic. Coveney said the behaviour of UK ministers was “creating a lot of tension in my country, your closest neighbour, and also potentially being on the verge of making a decision that could fundamentally undermine the functioning of the institutions of the peace process in Northern Ireland”. He told Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News that the relations between Britain and Ireland were being fundamentally damaged because of “unhelpful briefings that we’re getting from very, very senior levels within the British government this week”. Coveney said the EU had not threatened any specific retaliation – though several European parliamentarians have said there will be consequences, including the potential suspension of the trade deal, should the UK government act unilaterally. “There’s no way the EU can compromise if the UK is threatening unilateral action to pass domestic legislation to set aside international obligations under an international treaty that, don’t forget, the UK was the primary designer of along with the EU,” he said.",News/UK news,Boris Johnson poised to give green light to bill on Northern Ireland protocol ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/15/boris-johnson-poised-to-agree-controversial-bill-to-suspend-parts-of-ni-protocol
5/16/2022,"Good morning. Climate change is a top priority for voters in this week’s federal election. The big parties are vying to flip the long-held seats of Reid and Parramatta. And from onion eating to the bonk ban, we’ve got the 15 craziest moments in Australian politics sorted. A white teenager opened fire at a Buffalo, New York supermarket on Saturday, killing 10 people and wounding three others in what authorities have described as a “hate crime and racially motivated violent extremism”. Eleven of the 13 victims were Black and two were white. Authorities said the 18-year-old drove to Tops Friendly Market about 2.30pm “allegedly wearing tactical gear and armed with an assault weapon”. He shot four people outside the grocery, three of whom died, local prosecutors said. He then entered the supermarket, where a security guard, a retired police officer, tried to stop him. The guard was killed, and the shooter shot eight additional people inside the store, six of whom died, authorities said. The attacker was arraigned on a first-degree murder charge hours later. Vigils were held on Sunday across Buffalo for the victims. In striking Tops Friendly, the shooter – a self-confessed white supremacist – was not just hitting at a supermarket, but also a place where locals gathered as a community. The shooting comes amid a rise in racial violence in the US: hate-based crime has been getting worse, largely cultivated in the cauldron of the darkest reaches of the internet. Australia’s major parties are vying to flip long-held seats of Reid and Parramatta, as many voters remain undecided, uninterested and unsure. Though Scott Morrison’s name may be a negative in the marginal seats of western Sydney, that doesn’t necessarily translate into enthusiasm for Labor. We asked Guardian Australia readers about the local issues that matter most to them in the forthcoming election. Overwhelmingly, climate change topped the list. From natural disasters to food security and transitioning the economy away from a reliance on fossil fuels, the local effects of climate change will be at the forefront of many voters’ minds. Hospital overcrowding and delays to care have never been worse, and the morale among emergency doctors and nurses has taken an enormous hit, writes Stephen Parnis. Residents of a remote Indigenous community who have been left to drink uranium-contaminated water for a decade will get a new treatment plant by the end of the year. Julia Gillard has contributed a rare campaign endorsement for Katy Gallagher – the shadow finance minister – an intervention underscoring Labor’s concern that the high-profile independent David Pocock could split the progressive vote in Canberra. A member of the administrative appeals tribunal has said he was benched from hearing social security cases because he decided too many against the government. The NSW government has refused to pass laws closing a loophole that allows prison staff to treat children in youth detention as adults, including the use of “oppressive” fully naked strip-searches. Boris Johnson is poised to give the green light to controversial legislation on the Northern Ireland protocol this week as he flies to Belfast for crunch meetings, gambling that the move will restart stalled talks. Russia may have lost a third of the invasion force it sent into Ukraine as its offensive continues to struggle in the face of stiff resistance, British military intelligence has said. The Ministry of Defence said the Russian campaign in Ukraine’s east had “lost momentum” and was now “significantly behind schedule”. North Korea said a total of 42 people had died as the country began its fourth day under a nationwide lockdown aimed at stopping its first confirmed Covid-19 outbreak. At least 296,180 more people came down with fever symptoms and 15 more had died by yesterday, the state news agency said. Voters in Lebanon have gone to the polls in the first national election since a disastrous economic collapse and an explosion that wrecked the Beirut waterfront in 2020, amid low expectations that the leaders they hold responsible will face a serious challenge to their stranglehold on the country. The use of Pegasus spyware to target Catalan independence leaders and Spanish politicians – including the prime minister – has plunged Spain into a “crisis of democracy” and national security that can be tackled only with an independent investigation, a leading cybersecurity expert has warned. There is a moment a few episodes into Conversations With Friends, the adaptation of Sally Rooney’s debut novel, when it seems as though the makers are deliberately trolling viewers, writes Lucy Mangan. She says she likes a mood piece as much as the next person, but to stretch one out across a dozen episodes is to test the boundaries of even the most willing soul. I am lucky to have old friends, writes Catherine Carr. Being in their company is one of my favourite things. I have also been married for ages, and I sometimes indulge in the image of me in 2061, clasping the dry old hand of my husband and telling whoever will listen about the young man I married, and our secret to a long and happy life together. But, magnificent as these relationships are, they will probably not be the longest of my life, nor – perhaps – the most formative. Those accolades are reserved for the bonds I have with my two sisters. Want to make art? You better be rich. Wages are low, work insecure and funding has been gutted. Amid a cost-of-living crisis and a pandemic, is Australia about to lose a swathe of artists to obscurity? People with disability say their NDIS support is being cut and the process to appeal the decision is weighted against them. The Coalition has previously claimed the cost of the scheme is blowing out but is promising to “fully fund” it going forward, while Labor is proposing a major overhaul to the NDIS if it wins government.Laura Murphy-Oates speaks to Guardian Australia’s social affairs and inequality editor, Luke Henriques-Gomes, about reports that crucial disability supports are being cut and what the major parties are planning for the future of the NDIS.

5/16/2022,"Chelsea are not a sentimental team by nature. Nor are they a team who appear overly preoccupied by questions of style and process. They can play football from the stars and football from the gutter – often in the same game, occasionally even in the same move. They are not, by any stretch of the imagination, an ugly or unappealing side to watch. But nor, by the same token, do they crave approval in the slightest. What does this mean in practice? If you are Jess Carter, it means that, when Lauren Hemp starts running at you with 80 minutes played in the FA Cup final, at the head of a five-on-three Manchester City counterattack, you immediately and instinctively chop her down. If you are Sam Kerr, it means that even when you have barely had a touch of the ball all game, you still somehow leave the pitch with two goals and a medal round your neck. If you are Erin Cuthbert, it means that even in the thick of a bruising and broken midfield battle you can locate the one moment of pure balletic grace that will turn the game on its head. And if you are Emma Hayes, it means you have no hesitation in substituting off one of your substitutes to close down the game, even when that player is Ji So-yun, an all-time great playing her last ever game for your club. Maybe for the neutral or the purist there was a certain unsatisfying imperfection to the way Chelsea won this: a deflected goal past a distraught goalkeeper in a game that could really have gone either way. In fact, it was hard to imagine a better expression of what Chelsea do, what they stand for, how they win. The freakish lob, the 25-yard screamer, the lucky ricochet: Hayes celebrates them all just the same like the owner of a provincial construction firm who has just received a frankly astonishing county court judgment in her favour. Manchester City had 61% of the possession here. They had 23 shots to Chelsea’s nine, created most of the running, most of the pressure, most of the chances, most of the excitement. They came into this game on a high of 14 straight wins, with key players returning from injury, with fine rhythm and momentum. None of it was of the slightest relevance. One can call it rotten luck or one can call it a lack of composure. Ultimately, when they wake up on Monday morning nursing bruises and a broken heart, it does not remotely matter. Certainly City seemed keen to match Chelsea physically, aggressively asserting their territory, tightly marking the main attacking threats. It was a niggly, grapply opening, analogous to the bit at the start of a Scrabble game where both players seem intent on assembling a thicket of annoying and usually fictional two-letter words. Kerr’s opening goal was probably what the game needed. City came forward, shed a few inhibitions and equalised through Hemp, who cut inside and smashed the ball in with her weaker right foot. Cuthbert’s long-range strike on the hour seemed to have won the game but a minute from time Hayley Raso produced a sensational run and finish to make it 2-2. Many weaker teams than Chelsea might have subsided at that point. And yet through all the wildly juddering emotions of the day, it always felt as if Hayes was in control, still orchestrating, still seeing the game unfold a few moments before anyone else. She cycled calmly through her substitutions. Five at the back became four. Chelsea rolled up their sleeves, cleared their lines, settled in for the long haul and trusted that their opponents would crack first. They were right, of course. A large part of Chelsea’s devastating potency in these games is that sense of certainty: the ability not just to envisage their own triumph but somehow to make their opponents envisage it too. There was an inevitability to Kerr as she bore down on City’s goal in extra time, an inevitability to the deflection that took the ball past Ellie Roebuck, an inevitability to the way they saw the game out under the highest pressure, with the double on the line and a crowd of 49,000 baying for more drama. And for all the excellence on the pitch Hayes is really the common denominator in all this, the architect, the dreamer. Superstars come and go. Teams are dismantled and remade. But before Hayes arrived the biggest thing Chelsea had ever won was the Surrey County Cup. She built this thing from scratch, made it flesh over almost a decade, kept renewing and refreshing the dynasty. This is how one wins the two biggest prizes in domestic football without ever really seeming to get out of third gear. Hayes’s Chelsea have played better matches, more emphatic matches, more important matches. But there has perhaps never been a match that more perfectly encapsulated their essence. You think you have them on the ropes, you think they are riding their luck but really you are just playing their game and deep down you know it. Afterwards Chelsea’s exhausted players and their exhausted coach took their curtain call and strode out towards the east end of Wembley where the blue flags were still flying. They looked not euphoric but defiant, not victorious but vindicated. “This is who we are,” they seemed to be saying. “Did you ever doubt us?”",Sport/Football,FA Cup final win encapsulates essence of Emma Hayes’s Chelsea | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/15/fa-cup-final-win-encapsulates-essence-of-emma-hayess-chelsea
5/16/2022,"Emma Hayes said her current group of players is the “best I’ve ever coached” after Chelsea’s hard-fought 3-2 victory against Manchester City in the FA Cup final. “Honestly, those women will go down in history,” a beaming Hayes said. “I will look back in 10 years’ time and I’ll be like: ‘That group was immense.’ It’s the best team I’ve ever coached. “I totally understand that we always want to talk about perfection in football but having been on the winning side more often than not, let me tell you, it’s about human endeavour. And we have a group of people who are not going to be on the losing team, they’ll find a way.” Hayes’s team twice took the lead in a thrilling chess match of a game that went to extra time in front of a record crowd for the final. Sam Kerr put Chelsea ahead in the 33rd minute only for Lauren Hemp to equalise shortly before half-time. Erin Cuthbert restored Chelsea’s lead just after the hour but the City substitute Hayley Raso scored with a minute of normal time remaining. Kerr struck again in the first half of extra time. The Manchester City manager, Gareth Taylor, said that rather than disappointment he felt pride in the fight shown by his side. “Of course I’m biased but I felt we were the dominant team for large periods of the game,” he said. “We showed character to bounce back. “We were the only team in extra time that I felt was going to go on and do it but then we made a slight error on the halfway line which ended up costing us. Obviously, it’s difficult then because Chelsea can see the finish line and see the game out. “My feeling at the moment isn’t really disappointment. Of course, we have lifted the trophy before and wanted to do it again but at the moment my feeling is of pride for the way the team has played at times.” Hayes was overcome with the win. “I seriously want to cry with joy,” she said. “I’m so happy, if you can’t tell from the smile on my face. I’ve been involved in lots of football matches. Nothing was more enjoyable than that win today. Even though my assistant nearly knocked me out following our winner. He literally pulverises me. That game was a win for women’s football. “I love these games. I love playing Man City and they love playing us for the same reason, it’s football at the highest level. Tactically both teams have their strengths. I thought we did enough because we stopped them in their game, in the way that I’ve seen them control the games. I thought we were bold; really, really bold and I think that’s why we’re the winning team.” Sign up for our new and free women’s football newsletter! The manager was dismissive of speculation regarding her future in the post-Abramovich era after completing the league and FA Cup double meant she has 11 major trophies with Chelsea. “You ask me this question every time that we win so it’s not like I’m coming in here disrespecting the question, but I think this needs to be about the three players that are departing rather than my future,” she said, referring to Jonna Andersson, Ji So-yun and Drew Spence. “As far as I’m concerned I don’t have to kill any speculation. I’m under contract at Chelsea and there’s nothing to talk about.”",Sport/Football,Emma Hayes hails Chelsea’s FA Cup winners as ‘best I’ve ever coached’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/emma-hayes-hails-chelseas-fa-cup-winners-as-best-ive-ever-coached
5/16/2022,"Frank Lampard was critical of the officials after Everton lost 3-2 to Brentford. Jarrad Branthwaite and Salomón Rondón were sent off and the manager was left upset by his side not being given a penalty in the buildup to the first dismissal, when the home side were 1-0 up. Richarlison was having his shirt pulled by Mads Bech Sørensen in the area but Michael Oliver did not award a penalty, allowing Brentford to clear the ball up the pitch, where Branthwaite pulled down Ivan Toney to earn his first-half red. “I thought it was a penalty,” Lampard said. “It’s a shirt pull, a clear shirt pull, it’s a foul in the box. If you’re asking Richarlison to go down then you’re asking people to fall on the floor. My players have been criticised, when they shouldn’t have been, for going down for fouls that are fouls. I think that was a penalty. I can’t complain about the red after that. If they don’t give that [the penalty] then it’s a red card. “The reality is we’re on the bad end of a lot of decisions this season. That’s hard because I have to represent the club and the fans that come here and those small margins can affect our position. I do believe if it’s a penalty on the shirt pull means 2-0 and 11 men, and I think we all know how that game goes.” Sørensen did give away a penalty for a pull on Richarlison before half-time but the defender was not given a second yellow card, which Lampard believes would have been deserved. Rondón will be unavailable for Everton’s crucial final two games against Crystal Palace and Arsenal and Branthwaite for the first of those, a further blow to Lampard. Rondón was sent off for a two-footed lunge on Rico Henry four minutes after coming off the bench. “Salomón’s is a bad tackle, I think you see in his reaction then he comes off. It’s a hot-headed reaction. It’s not the Salomón I know.”",Sport/Football,‘We’re on the bad end of decisions’: Lampard unhappy after Everton lose,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/were-on-the-bad-end-of-decisions-lampard-unhappy-after-everton-lose
5/16/2022,"David Tennant and Catherine Tate will return to Doctor Who for the show’s 60th anniversary celebrations, the BBC has announced. The duo have reunited after 12 years to film scenes that are due to air next year. Tennant, 51, first stepped into the Tardis in 2005 to play the 10th Time Lord, with his final episode airing on New Year’s Day in 2010. Comedic actor Tate, 52, starred as his companion Donna Noble. The Doctor and Donna parted ways when the Time Lord had to wipe her memory in order to save her life. He left her family with a warning that if she had a memory of the past, she would die, because the powers that she possessed threatened to overwhelm her brain. Russell T Davies, Doctor Who’s returning showrunner, said: “They’re back! And it looks impossible – first, we announce a new Doctor, and then an old Doctor, along with the wonderful Donna. What on earth is happening? “Maybe this is a missing story. Or a parallel world. Or a dream, or a trick, or a flashback. The only thing I can confirm is that it’s going to be spectacular, as two of our greatest stars reunite for the battle of a lifetime.” Tennant took over the protagonist’s role in 2005 from Christopher Eccleston, and was succeeded by Matt Smith. The Scottish actor returned for an appearance in the 50th anniversary special, The Day of the Doctor, in 2013. Like his predecessors, Tennant has continued to play the role off-screen in a series of spin-off audio releases. In 2020 he was voted the fans’ favourite Doctor. Tennant and Tate’s collaborations extend beyond Doctor Who. The pair worked on a stage version of Much Ado About Nothing together in 2011 and Tenant also made a cameo appearance on The Catherine Tate Show. Doctor Who returns to BBC One later this year with a 90-minute special episode to celebrate the BBC’s centenary, which will be Jodie Whittaker’s last appearance as the 13th Doctor. Sex Education actor Ncuti Gatwa, 29, will be taking over from Whittaker and becomes the fourth person of Scottish origin to take up the post following on from Sylvester McCoy, fellow Royal Conservatoire graduate Tennant and Peter Capaldi. Showrunner Chris Chibnall, who cast Whittaker as the programme’s first female protagonist, is leaving to be replaced by Davies, who was behind the programme’s 2005 reboot and left in 2009.",Arts/Television & radio,David Tennant and Catherine Tate to return to Doctor Who in 2023,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/15/david-tennant-catherine-tate-return-doctor-who-2023
5/16/2022,"The Metropolitan police are investigating social media footage which appears to show a man being repeatedly struck on the head by officers while on the ground in an incident in east London on Saturday evening. During a pre-planned operation to tackle moped and e-scooter crime in Dalston, an area which is often crowded with food delivery riders, police attempted to arrest a man for immigration offences and a crowd gathered to prevent it. The footage, posted to Twitter, shows a protester clashing with officers outside Kingsland shopping centre, and during a struggle he is seemingly struck in the head five times. Police said a number of officers were assaulted during the incident and that “any footage showing use of force” was being “reviewed” by the directorate of professional standards. On Twitter, the incident was described as “a bit of a standoff”, with the crowd in Dalston chanting “fuck the police”. A Met spokesperson said: “We are aware of a number of videos on social media filmed during the incident. We would urge people to remember that such videos rarely provide a full and accurate picture of what is taking place. “Police officers are aware that any use of force must be proportionate and reasonable, and they understand that their actions will be scrutinised as they go about their work and that they will be held to account where appropriate.” Nine people were arrested for offences including violent disorder. They remain in police custody. It comes after a similar standoff in Edinburgh on 5 May during which dozens of protesters gathered to stop Home Office vans leaving an area of the city after a raid.

5/16/2022,"My grandmother, Elisabeth Evans, was a refugee from the Nazis during the second world war who found sanctuary in Britain. An only child, she lost most of her family during the conflict and went on to have eight children of her own. Elisabeth, who has died aged 96, was born in Pottenstein, Austria, to Rose (nee Fanta), who was Jewish, and Ludwig Achtner, a Lutheran lawyer who worked for Jewish clients in Vienna. Her later childhood was marked by the rise of Adolf Hitler, whose long speeches Elisabeth had to endure at compulsory youth rallies. By the eve of war, the family were in danger and Ludwig took his own life. Virtually all of her maternal family perished, murdered in ghettos and camps. She never fully recovered from the heartbreak of losing her grandparents and father. In the summer of 1939, Elisabeth and her mother arrived in London, the Quakers having helped arrange safe passage. Rose went into domestic service and Elisabeth was accepted into the celebrated Bunce Court school in Kent, run by Anna Essinger for children escaping from the Nazis. Elisabeth excelled at school and made lifelong friendships. By the mid-1940s she was living with Jewish friends and activists in what she described as a “London kibbutz” in Highgate. The property was destroyed one evening by German bombing, killing her friends, with Elisabeth surviving because her room lay above the rubble. A political person, astute and progressive, she met her husband, William Evans, an architect, when they were both active in the Labour party in Paddington. They married in 1948 and Elisabeth converted to Catholicism. She went on to have eight children, and later explained that she had been denied birth control. Her years as a busy mother and wife supportive of her husband’s career masked her own abilities. She was a talented pianist and mathematician. She was nonetheless devoted to her family. Always forgiving and loyal, she loved music, played the piano, read extensively, and was always informed (and usually angry) about politics. She smoked like a chimney for decades, until suddenly stopping in solidarity with one of her sons who was trying to quit. She did not drink, but had a taste for fine food, especially Austrian dishes. It was a blow to her when in the 1980s her marriage broke up, though she and William never divorced. Elisabeth is survived by seven of her eight children, 13 grandchildren, eight great-grandchildren and three great-great grandchildren.",News/World news,Elisabeth Evans obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/elisabeth-evans-obituary
5/16/2022,"The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, will face a grilling from angry Conservative MPs over inflation on Monday, as cabinet sources moved to quell the incendiary remarks about the Bank’s independence. The governor’s appearance before MPs – which has been likened to the showdowns with former Bank boss Lord Mervyn King during the 2008 crash – will come amid intense work from the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to find new measures to ease the cost of living before the summer recess. Labour will challenge Conservative MPs to vote for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies in an amendment to the Queen’s speech – a move Sunak has failed to rule out but which is intensely opposed by the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng. Bailey’s appearance at the Treasury select committee will come in the aftermath of growing criticism of the Bank’s performance, including from some cabinet ministers, one of whom told the Telegraph they were now “questioning its independence”. Cabinet sources moved to quell speculation, with one dismissing the prospect as “not even up for discussion”. Another cabinet minister called independence “sacrosanct” and said the Bank’s situation was not unique: “All central banks are grappling inflation.” A Downing Street source said that Boris Johnson was not entertaining the prospect. Harriett Baldwin, one of the Tory MPs on the committee, said there were serious questions for the Bank to answer on inflation. “I have been flagging up for a long time now the risk of them misjudging things and putting in too much monetary stimulus into the economy for too long,” she said. “When things started to open up again, they didn’t really take their foot off the pedal very quickly. There are things that have been unforeseen like the war in Ukraine, but there are things that were foreseen that the fiscal and monetary stimulus was there for too long and too protracted once things started to recover.” Kwarteng said on Sunday that it was concerning that inflation was running higher than the Bank’s target. “It is a matter of fact that when the Bank of England became independent in 1997, they had an inflation target of 2%. Inflation is running into almost double digits now. That is an issue, clearly,” he told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme. “We have had the Covid pandemic, we have had a huge spike in economic activity after the lockdown restrictions were eased, and then, of course, you have got this war in Europe for the first time in 70 years. “All of these things mean that it is a very difficult time and I think [Bailey] is doing a reasonable job. But it is true to say that 2% is part of their mandate and they have to keep it to 2%.” Labour said the attacks on the bank’s independence were a distraction. Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow chancellor, said: “Instead of trying to blame the Bank of England for the government’s mistakes, the chancellor should call an emergency budget, scrap the hike in national insurance and back Labour’s costed plan for a windfall tax to help keep people’s energy bills down.” The Treasury has denied plans for an emergency budget but is expected to announce some new limited measures to ease the cost of living once data on fuel prices appears within the next fortnight, which will inform the autumn price cap rise. Tax changes will be impossible before the autumn budget, though Johnson has repeatedly insisted to MPs that he is looking for ways to cut taxes. The shadow climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, said it was “frankly obscene that the government is refusing” a windfall tax on oil and gas companies and predicted it was inevitable, calling it an “unanswerable case”.",News/Business,Tory MPs to grill Bank of England governor over high inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/15/tory-mps-to-grill-bank-of-england-governor-over-high-inflation
5/16/2022,"Frontlines have shifted as Russia makes advances in the fiercely contested eastern Donbas region, and Ukraine’s forces waged a successful counteroffensive near the strategic Russian-held city of Izium. Near the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, where Ukrainian forces have been on the attack since early this month, local commanders said they believed Russia was withdrawing troops to reinforce positions around Izium to the south. Russia’s defence ministry claimed to have carried out “high-precision” missile strikes on four artillery munitions depots in the Donetsk area, also destroying two missile-launching systems and radar and taking out 15 Ukrainian drones. But British military intelligence said in an update that Russia’s offensive in the Donbas had “lost momentum” and that it believed Moscow had now lost one-third of its invading force. Heavy fighting is still raging at the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, as Russian forces attempt to complete the capture of the strategically vital port. A pro-Russian separatist commander posted a video on Sunday showing white brightly burning munitions falling on the steel plant. It was not immediately apparent what type of munitions were used or the time of the video, which was posted on the Telegram messaging application by Alexander Khodakovsky, a commander of the forces of the pro-Russian self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk. Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers are holed up in the steel mill’s underground bunkers, many of them wounded. Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion, Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long considered the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and Belarus before the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had 169,000-190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land, and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s oft-repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine would never join Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees, and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
5/16/2022,"It should have been the day Everton put themselves on the verge of securing Premier League survival, instead they imploded. They finished with nine men after Jarrad Branthwaite, then Salomón Rondón, set the team’s downfall in motion. Strikes from Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison were not enough, as Brentford took advantage of Branthwaite’s first-half dismissal thanks to a Séamus Coleman own goal and headers from Yoane Wissa and Rico Henry, who was the victim of Rondón’s ludicrous late lunge. Calvert-Lewin quickly showed what Everton have missed for much of this season. Making his first start since 9 April, the striker flicked a long pass back into the path of Richarlison in the third minute. The Brazil forward controlled the ball but had it whipped off his feet by Anthony Gordon on the edge of the box, allowing him to jab a shot at goal which David Raya palmed up in the air; Richarlison could only head wide. The vociferous home fans were rewarded within 10 minutes when Gordon was tripped on the right flank. The winger dusted himself off to take the free-kick, whipping in a low cross to the front post for Richarlison to attack. His connection was weak at best, but it was enough to divert the ball across Raya into the corner, trickling into the net via a touch from Calvert-Lewin. Cue an eruption, a flare on the pitch and the smell of smoke mixed with optimism. That optimism quickly dissipated in a controversial 10-second spell. Richarlison claimed he deserved a penalty after having his shirt pulled by Kristoffer Ajer in the box but the referee, Michael Oliver, saw nothing illegal in the grappling. Mathias Jensen cleared the ball upfield for Ivan Toney, who tweeted after the match about his family having been racially abused, to chase. The poor positioning of Everton’s defence gave him a head start. Branthwaite raced behind him but he curtailed Toney’s run outside the area by pulling him down, resulting in a red card. “I thought it was a penalty,” Frank Lampard said. “The reality is we’re on the bad end of a lot of decisions this season. That’s hard because I have to represent the club and the fans that come here and those small margins can affect our position. I do believe if it’s a penalty on the shirt pull, it means 2-0 and 11 men, and I think we all know how that game goes.” The mood was not improved when Everton failed to clear a corner, allowing Brentford to rebuild their attack. That resulted in a Wissa cross from the left being diverted into his own net by Coleman’s flicked header to silence Goodison once more. Another Calvert-Lewin flick-on ensured the half ended as it started: with a Richarlison chance. He did not get the opportunity to take aim on this occasion because Mads Sørensen pulled down the Everton player, although the defender did not receive a second booking. Amid all the anxiety around the ground, Richarlison stayed calm to slot down the middle. Cue more flares. Christian Eriksen provided the perfect cross for the equaliser. The midfielder whipped a corner to the front post where Wissa found space to flick across goal and beyond Jordan Pickford. Everton’s problems dealing with crosses were becoming clear, which is unsurprising for a team missing a centre-back for the majority of the game. Before Brentford’s supporters had stopped celebrating the leveller, they were ahead. Jensen’s deep cross from the right was attacked with gusto by Henry, one of the smallest players on the pitch. He leapt out of a sea of blue to power a header into the top corner to complete the turnaround. Rondón committed the final act with a heinous two-footed lunge on Henry late on four minutes after coming off the bench. Rondón will be unavailable for Everton’s crucial final two games against Crystal Palace and Arsenal and Branthwaite will miss the first of these, a further blow to Lampard. Everton sit two points clear of Burnley and one above Leeds but they will anticipate needing to win one of their remaining fixtures. “A lot of so-called experts said we were on holiday and we didn’t have anything to fight for,” said Thomas Frank, whose side face Leeds on the final day. “We need to be very professional and want to win as many games for Brentford fans but also to show respect for the league to do everything we can because if I was in that situation, I would expect that from other teams.”",Sport/Football,Everton suffer two red cards as Rico Henry gives Brentford turnaround win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/everton-brentford-premier-league-match-report
5/16/2022,"Pep Guardiola insisted Manchester City’s players will give “all of their lives” against Aston Villa on Sunday after his side’s comeback against West Ham left them needing one more victory to seal a second successive Premier League title. City know that victory against Steven Gerrard’s side will be enough to see off Liverpool’s challenge despite Riyad Mahrez’s failure to seal a comeback victory at the London Stadium. Having trailed 2-0 at half-time after Jarrod Bowen struck twice, City battled back through Jack Grealish and an own goal from Vladimir Coufal before Mahrez was denied from the spot by Lukasz Fabianski. Liverpool must now beat Southampton on Tuesday night and hope their former captain Gerrard can produce a result at the Etihad Stadium at the weekend to have a chance of overhauling their rivals. But with a full house expected as City attempt to win a fourth title in five seasons under their manager, Guardiola is confident his players can seize the moment. “I can assure you something – that we will give them all of our lives to do it,” he said. “It’s an incredible privilege to have the chance to become champions in front of our people at home and I’m looking forward to it. “We will rest for a couple of days and try to be ready for Villa but the positive thing is it’s still in our hands. They are desperate to win it and we have showed that all season.” Guardiola added: “I have a feeling every time you win a title it gets more difficult. But this is what you expect when you are up against a team like Liverpool. We know we can’t make a mistake.” City ended their 44-year wait for a league title thanks to Sergio Agüero’s last-minute goal against Queens Park Rangers on the final day of the 2012 season and also won the title on the final day in 2019 after beating Brighton. Asked whether next weekend could be as dramatic, Guardiola – who admitted he had decided against introducing Ilkay Gündogan at half-time – said he was hoping for a more straightforward afternoon. “Ten years ago belongs to Sergio,” he said. “It’s similar because of the maths. It will be tough because it will be emotional but we will give absolutely everything that we have to win the title. The players have so much desire to win the game. “To win the title is not just about how good we are with the ball. Of course that is important but there are many other aspects and we showed that today.” West Ham’s point confirmed that they will at least be in the European Conference next season as captain Mark Noble was given a rousing send-off after 18 years at the club. David Moyes admitted he was delighted with the performance of his team and backed Bowen to receive his first England call-up when Gareth Southgate names his next squad. “It’s not for me to pick the England team but I think he is doing as well as anyone in England. I thought his two goals today were fabulous,” said Moyes. “I want to try and build. Next season will be hard but for us to have European football again will be fantastic.”",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola promises City will give ‘all of their lives’ to retain league,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/pep-guardiola-promises-city-will-give-all-of-their-lives-to-retain-league
5/16/2022,"On Saturday, 18-year-old Payton Gendron parked his car in front of the entrance to a Tops Supermarket in a Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York. Exiting the car wearing metal armor and holding an assault rifle, he shot and killed a female employee in front of the store, and a man packing groceries into the trunk of his car. After entering the store, he murdered the store’s guard, and by the end of his killing spree, he had shot 13 people, killing 10 of them. Eleven of the people he shot were Black, and two were white. As the manifesto he left behind makes clear, this was fully intentional. The first listed goal in his manifesto was to “kill as many blacks as possible”. Gendron was a meticulous planner. He live-streamed his massacre, and the video begins with him following to the letter the beginning of the plan he lays out in the manifesto.. But the manifesto – which is meant to inspire and instruct subsequent attacks – also outlines the ideology that inspired the murders. Gendron was motivated by a classic version of White Replacement Theory, the view that a cabal of global elites is trying to destroy white nations, via the systematic replacement of white populations. According to White Replacement Theory, the strategies employed by these “global elites” include the mass immigration of supposedly “high fertility” non-whites, and encouraging intermingling between members of non-white races and whites. Gendron was deeply influenced by a series of recent mass killers who were animated by white replacement theory including Brenton Tarrant, whom Gendron openly acknowledges as his model. In Christchurch, New Zealand, Tarrant massacred 51 people at a Mosque in the name of White Replacement Theory, also live-streaming his actions. Gendron’s manifesto begins in a similar fashion to Tarrant’s, by decrying the “white genocide” that will result from the supposedly low fertility rates of white populations and the high fertility rates of non-white immigrants brought in to “replace” them. It is more openly anti-Black than Tarrant’s manifesto – it is a deeply American version, with roots in Jim Crow and lynching. It is also vastly more explicitly antisemitic. Ten pages of Gendron’s manifesto are devoted to arguing for a genetic basis for the racial IQ gap, as well as (ironically) a genetic basis for higher rates of violent crime. It’s clear that Gendron closely follows various academic debates about race, IQ, and crime. According to the ideology guiding Gendron, Black people are not intelligent enough to engineer the replacement of whites, and the destruction of their civilization. The real actors behind White Replacement, according to Gendron, are the Jews, a topic which occupies the subsequent 29 pages of his manifesto. Gendron’s lengthy section on Jews purports to document Jewish hatred of non-Jews. It includes a section of Talmud quotes supporting Gendron’s thesis that Jews hate Christians, and a section documenting supposed control of academia, media, and industry (focusing on the pharmaceutical industry). Gendron ties Jews to child abuse and pedophilia. The section mocks a supposed Jewish fixation on environmental causes of Black crime. Gendron argues that Jews are behind Black social and political movements and organizations, including the NAACP and Black Lives Matter. Gendron also argues that Jews are behind the movement for transgender inclusivity, supposedly sponsoring transgender summer camps for “Scandinavian style whites”. The section ends by blaming Jews for creating “infighting” between people and races. The example Gendron’s manifesto provides is that “Jews are spreading ideas such as Critical Race Theory and white shame/guilt to brainwash Whites into hating themselves and their people”. The ideology that motivated Gendron’s mass murder in Buffalo, White Replacement Theory, has a lengthy and blood-soaked 20th century history. Since 2011, it has been the explicit motivation for over 160 murders, including Norway’s Anders Breivik’s slaughter of 77 people, mostly immigrants, in 2011, Dylann Roof’s mass murder of Black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015, the Tree of Life Synagogue killings in 2018, and the murder of 23 people, mostly immigrants, in El Paso, Texas, in 2019. Mass atrocities do not occur in a vacuum. They are enabled by a present normalization of a lengthy previous history, a process that the philosopher of mass killing Lynne Tirrell labels the social embeddedness condition. White Replacement Theory was the dominant structuring narrative of Nazi ideology. Adolf Hitler also announced his genocidal intent in a lengthy manifesto about the supposed Jewish threat to white civilization, entitled Mein Kampf, which was published in 1924. Hitler also was obsessed by mass immigration, and the threat it posed to “white civilization.” Currently, White Replacement Theory has been mass popularized and normalized, perhaps chiefly by the American political commentator Tucker Carlson. It is rapidly moving to the center of the mainstream narrative of America’s Republican party. In this form, it appears stripped of its explicit connection to antisemitism. You will not find Tucker Carlson asserting that the Jews are behind the mass replacement of American whites that he bemoans regularly in what is regularly the most watched cable news show in the United States among adults 25-54. But what Carlson has been doing is spending an entire year repeating a conspiracy by Christopher Rufo that says that American education has been infected by a pro-Black ideology (CRT) that was created by German Jewish Marxist intellectuals (the Frankfurt School). And that while the CRT version of this conspiracy theory is new, it is a direct descendent of the “cultural marxism” conspiracy theory, which was a primary topic of Breivik’s manifesto. The fact that Carlson does not mention American Jews as a target by name should be cold comfort to American Jews. Every single right wing anti-Semite in America who watches Tucker Carlson’s show hears him as denouncing Jews when he regularly platforms the 20th century’s worst anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. Some American Jews hope that by identifying as white, and lending their support to racist narratives about IQ and crime, they can diminish rightwing American antisemitism. This is a terrible error. American Ku Klux Klan ideology in the 1920s strongly overlapped with Nazi ideology, placing Jews at the center of a conspiracy fomenting a supposed race war to overthrow white civilization. American Jews who support Tucker Carlson and his ilk, that is, others who repeat the White Replacement narrative, are supporters both of anti-Black racism, and antisemitism in its most violent form. It is in the tracts of the 20th century’s most explicit antisemites that we find the development of White Replacement Theory, who used it to justify the mass killing of Jews. Gendron’s manifesto reveals yet again the unbreakable historical link between anti-Black racism and antisemitism. Any supporter of White Replacement Theory is a clear enemy of the Jewish People. America has many mass shootings. But this mass killing of Black Americans in a Buffalo supermarket must serve as a wake-up call to our country. White Replacement Theory is deeply ingrained in the worst aspects of American and European history. With its attacks on “Critical Race Theory”, this is a fact that the American political right is deliberately and knowingly trying to erase from our collective consciousness, so they can appeal to it again as a political weapon against liberal democracy. As Gendron’s manifesto makes clear, White Replacement Theory is not just an attack on minorities. It is a weapon directed by fascists at American democracy itself.",Opinion/Opinion,Buffalo shooting: how white replacement theory keeps inspiring mass murder | Jason Stanley,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/15/buffalo-shooting-white-replacement-theory-inspires-mass
5/16/2022,"The New South Wales government has refused to pass laws closing a loophole that allows prison staff to treat children in youth detention as adults, including the use of “oppressive” fully-naked-body strip-searches. The NSW Ombudsman, Paul Miller, has invoked his rarely used power to force ministers to respond to his investigation into the use of adult strip-search powers against children, saying he was not satisfied the government had taken sufficient steps to address his calls for the law to be overhauled. Last year, Miller furnished a special report to parliament detailing a case in 2019 when three children in a youth detention centre were subjected to a strip-search in which they were made to completely undress and spread apart their buttocks. The search occurred in a room monitored by CCTV. In NSW, youth justice officers are only able to conduct partial strip-searches – meaning children in detention cannot be searched while naked. Youth justice rules also ban the use of a strip-search in view of CCTV. But the report raised concerns that a memorandum of understanding signed between youth justice and corrective services NSW allowed for those laws to be circumvented. The 2019 MOU allowed corrective services staff from the general prison population to enter children’s detention centres during a “riot or disturbance”. The wording of that agreement, the ombudsman found, allowed corrections staff to “bring with them all the same powers for the children and young people as they have for adult prisoners in an adult correctional centre”. “In effect, the youth justice centre becomes legally ‘cloaked’ as an adult correctional centre for so long as the CSNSW officers have control of it, so that the children and young people in that centre may lawfully be treated by those officers in the same way,” the report last year found. But the government has refused to implement the recommendations to overhaul the laws to ban the use of fully naked body searches on children, a decision the ombudsman has now forced them to explain to the state’s parliament. In a rare use of the ombudsman’s powers to demand further explanation from the government, Miller published a second report on the issue late last week saying changes introduced by the government did not address the problem. The 2019 search of the three children was “oppressive”, “disproportionate to the risk posed”, and “unreasonable”, the ombudsman found. Officers from corrective services were called to the Frank Baxter Youth Justice Centre after a disturbance in which the three young people had climbed on to the roof of a building and “made a series of serious threats to the safety of staff”. They were eventually convinced to come down from the building, where they were handcuffed and subjected to pat-down searches which did not find anything. Officers then conducted a fully naked body strip-search which required the children to completely undress. The ombudsman found a number of steps during the search were “unnecessary and inconsistent with policy”, and would not have usually been permitted under rules governing youth detention centres. The report found, for example, that officers inspected between the buttocks of one of the children, and instructed him to “lift his penis”. “Fully-naked-body (FNB) strip searches of children and young people are neither necessary nor appropriate and do not reflect good public policy,” Miller found in his special report. “In our view, the practice of FNB strip searching of young people is not consistent with the principles of trauma-informed practice, as an FNB strip search is almost always a confronting and humiliating experience.” In the report Miller made a number of recommendations aimed at closing a loophole which allowed the fully naked body searches under the remit of the MOU. The government, he said, should pass laws to “expressly prohibit” fully-naked-body searches of children and young people in detention as well as amending existing laws to ensure partial-body searches used “the least intrusive method required to achieve the purpose of the search”. But the government rejected those recommendations. In a joint-reply to last year’s report, the then corrections minister Anthony Roberts and minister for families and community services, Alister Henskens SC, said they did not support any legislative changes. Instead, the government said the MOU had been updated to give “additional guidance about the respective roles and responsibilities” of corrective services officers called to youth justice centres during cases of disturbances. But in his latest report, Miller found that under the terms of the new MOU corrections officers can still conduct fully naked body strip-searches on children. The new MOU, Miller wrote, states that the searches can be conducted in cases where a “risk” is identified, but “provides no guidance as to the circumstances that might constitute such a risk or who is to make that decision”. The new MOU also contains no requirement for officers to record why the search was conducted, he found. Under the policies corrective service officers are now required to have reasonable grounds before undertaking a partially clothed strip-search on a young person, but not a fully naked body search. Under the powers used by the ombudsman, the government is now required to give an explanation to parliament about its response to the report. In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson for the department of communities and justice said that it was working through the ombudsman’s report. The government is in the process of rolling out body scanner technology that it says will reduce the need for strip searches in youth detention centres. The spokesperson said the scanners were being rolled out “across all youth justice centres in NSW to improve safety and security for detainees and for staff”. “Youth Justice staff carry out partially clothed body searches to keep centres safe,” the spokesperson said. “At all times Youth Justice works to ensure the security and safety of Youth Justice centres, detainees and staff.”",News/Australia news,NSW government refuses to close legal loophole allowing prison staff to strip-search children,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/nsw-government-refuses-to-close-legal-loophole-allowing-prison-staff-to-strip-search-children
5/16/2022,"Residents of a remote Indigenous community who have been left to drink uranium-contaminated water for a decade will get a new treatment plant by the end of the year under a plan by the Northern Territory government to address the issue. Details of the project were revealed in a statement to the Australian stock exchange by engineering firm Clean TeQ Water, which announced it had signed a $5m contract in March to build an ion-exchange water filtration system for the 350-person community at Laramba. The Clean TeQ Water CEO, Willem Vriesendorp, directed questions to Northern Territory’s Power and Water Corporation but said in the statement the contract “demonstrates the development of our company in delivering larger and more complex plants. “The global need for groundwater treatment technologies is increasing [due to] economic activity, climate change, declining ground water levels and increasing pollution from natural sources, agriculture, and industry,” the statement said. Design of the system is currently under way and the “practical completion of the plant” is expected by 16 December 2022. The Central Lands Council CEO, Lesley Turner, said residents of Laramba had so far been left without details of the treatment plant and had been forced to pay for bottled water while they wait. “Minister Chansey Paech announced this filtration system in Laramba last October and told the community it would take 40 weeks to install,” Turner said. “Residents want to know why no work has started yet and why they still have no details about the technology. They also asked the government to supply Laramba with uncontaminated drinking water for those 40 weeks. “These are some of Australia’s poorest people, forced to shell out $12 for a box of safe drinking water that barely fills a few billies each. “We have been told the community will receive free, uncontaminated water at some stage, but the residents need urgent answers about when this will start.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The development comes as the community awaits the result of a legal challenge to a Northern Territory Civil and Administrative Tribunal decision in July 2020 that found landlords had no obligation to install filter taps in homes to ensure water was safe to drink. In Laramba the NT government is both landlord and supplies drinking water to the community. A decision is expected on Monday. The presence of uranium in Laramba’s water supply has been known since at least 2008 but the scale of the issue was only confirmed in 2018 when testing by Power and Water Corporation found concentrations of uranium at 0.046mg/L. This was nearly three times the limit of 0.017mg/L recommended in the Australian drinking water guidelines published by the National Health and Medical Research Council. Follow-up testing in 2020 found the problem was getting worse as uranium concentrations – which occur naturally in the area – had risen to 0.052mg/L. The water also contained contaminants such as nitrate and silica. In response to media pressure the NT government announced $28m in April 2021 to find “tailored” solutions for water issues in remote Aboriginal communities across the territory. Drinking water in remote Indigenous communities within the Northern Territory is managed by Indigenous Essential Services (IES), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the government-owned utility company Power and Water Corporation (PWC). IES has no staff, no offices and pays a fee to its parent company for administration services. During the community’s recent legal challenge, the NT government filed a fact sheet published by PWC as evidence. It said the company planned to build an “ion-exchange water treatment system” in Laramba that “has been proven to work in a similar environment in a remote Western Australian community”. The system operates by binding uranium ions with a resin to clean the water. It also said PWC “is getting approvals from Department of Health and the NT Environment Protection Authority” on the project. Guardian Australia contacted both NT Health and the EPA, but neither had received an application for approvals on the treatment plant. NT Health said PWC was “undertaking an assessment” about how to classify wastewater from the plant. “This classification will determine if approvals are required from NT Health,” it said.

When Guardian Australia asked PWC about the situation at Laramba in October last year, it could not confirm any work had taken place. Around that time representatives from PWC travelled to the Pilbara in Western Australia on a fact-finding trip to visit the remote community of Yandeyarra, where an ion-exchange water treatment plant has been operating for about 10 years. PWC was contacted for comment but declined to comment. The NT minister for essential services and water security, Eva Lawler, was expected to make an announcement regarding the water treatment plant this week.",News/Australia news,Remote NT community not told about $5m contract to fix uranium in water supply,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/remote-nt-community-not-told-about-5m-contract-to-fix-uranium-in-water-supply
5/16/2022,"A sunny Tuesday morning in mid-May and Amey Soo is on what she calls the “baby walk” along the water in the inner-west Sydney suburb of Drummoyne. As kayakers and fishers fiddle around on the boat ramp, she stands in the shade with her newborn in a carrier and contemplates her vote in the marginal electorate of Reid. She usually votes for the Liberal party, she tells Guardian Australia, but won’t be this time. She would have liked to support an independent, like the teal candidates running in the seats of Wentworth and North Sydney, but doesn’t see an obvious alternative. She is still “not too sure” about Labor, she says, but thinks they’re “the least of the evils”. So, why the change? “Because of Scott Morrison,” she says. Held by the Liberal party on a margin of just 3.2%, Reid is one of a few key NSW seats being targeted by Labor as it seeks to win government on 21 May. Internally, the party is confident of winning the seat, held by the moderate Liberal party MP Fiona Martin. But Labor has seen this movie before. In 2019 it also held high hopes Reid would flip, running the former McKell Institute executive director Sam Crosby. Instead, the seat’s margin barely shifted, one of a number of disappointments for Labor on the night. In 2022, western Sydney is, as always, a tantalising prospect for both major parties. As Labor hunts Reid, the Coalition believes it is in with a chance in the neighbouring seat of Parramatta, where Labor has preselected the economist Andrew Charlton, a former adviser to Kevin Rudd who was parachuted into the seat despite opposition from the local party. A diverse electorate which covers Sydney’s second CBD and the surrounding suburbs of Granville, Toongabbie, Dundas and Harris Park, Parramatta has been held by Labor since 2004. It has a high proportion of Arabic-speaking residents, as well as voters of Indian, Chinese and Lebanese descent. The local member, Julie Owens, is retiring, and the prime minister has made a series of appearances in the electorate alongside the Liberal party candidate, Maria Kovacic, who he has dubbed “the real eel” because of her support for the local rugby league club. The Coalition hopes Labor’s decision to install Oxford-educated Charlton, who lived in the ritzy eastern suburb of Bellevue Hill, will backfire. But voters who spoke to Guardian Australia for this piece either weren’t aware of the local candidates, or else were not worried. At a playground in Parramatta Park, Hannah Graham has just read an article in Sydney tabloid the Daily Telegraph about Charlton failing to name three favourite restaurants in the area. She hasn’t decided who she will vote for, and said the article didn’t sway her. “I don’t think it really matters that he’s not from here,” she says. “I’ve gone for jobs before where I didn’t know the company. I don’t think that means you’re not able to do the job necessarily.” Others are similarly inclined. In Harris Park, a suburb outside Parramatta with a large Indian-Australian population, Ramesh Vyas and his two friends Dinesh and Chiman Patel are all voting for Labor. “Mr Charlton!” they all echo when asked who they’re voting for. “Good man. He came to our temple. We love Charlton too much,” Vyas says. Hamna Amaan, from Guildford, hasn’t heard of either of the local candidates, but is nonetheless also supporting Labor. “I just like, favour them, with what they’re advocating,” she says. So too do Irfan Azhar, a construction worker from Granville who says he doesn’t trust the Liberal party, and Moses Nassar, who, while running his fingers over a set of rosary beads outside a Lebanese cafe in Harris Park, says he still loves Gough Whitlam. “I talked to [Andrew Charlton] last week,” he says. “He was here. I support Labor all the time. Labor gives a chance a little bit to the poor people. Liberal for rich people.” If that sounds bad for the Coalition, it certainly wasn’t the only impression. Voters like Louie El Azzi said he was voting for Morrison because he felt “comfortable” with him as prime minister. Varun Dabas was one of many who said he was voting for the Coalition because he believes they handled the Covid-19 pandemic well. Many others remained undecided, uninterested, or unsure about Albanese. Manorm Prasad thinks Morrison is “good”, and nominates education and safety as her two issues. But, like many first-generation Australians in Parramatta who Guardian Australia spoke to, she said she would ask her children for advice about who to vote for. “Definitely, they’re going to tell me what to do, because I have no idea and they are more educated than me,” she says. And so back to Reid. Stretching from the wealthy inner-west suburbs of Drummoyne and Five Dock to diverse, densely populated Strathfield and out to the true west around Lidcombe and Homebush, campaigning in Reid requires a deft touch. “It’s three different electorates,” Labor’s candidate, Sally Sitou, says. In the leafy bayside suburbs in and around Drummoyne, voters tend to have more in common with the wealthy eastern suburbs, where independents like Allegra Spender are causing headaches for moderate Liberal MPs. Usually a Liberal-dominated voting area, many residents here cite climate change and a federal integrity commission as key issues. Soo is one of them. She calls Morrison a “hypocrite”, who has embarrassed Australia internationally by dragging his feet on climate action. She cites a series of billboards organised by comedian Dan Ilic before the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow which satirised Australia’s record on emissions reductions. “It just makes a mockery of Australia,” she says. “[He] just makes us look like we want to sell coal to anyone and everyone when we’re not – we’re not like that.” She is not alone. Also on his morning walk is retiree Vaughn Kirkby. Another longtime Liberal party supporter, he’s feeling particularly torn as the election approaches. Kirkby likes the local Liberal party MP, Fiona Martin, and supported her crossing the floor to oppose the government’s religious discrimination bill. “She represents my views,” he says of Martin. Kirkby doesn’t rate the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, and he hasn’t been impressed by the opposition generally – “I think there’s a lot of lightweights” – and yet, he’s still not sure he can bring himself to vote for Morrison. “He’s a grub,” Kirkby says. “He’s just, you know, he’s marketing. He’s thin.” Not everyone agrees, of course. Fiona Sarkis, a lawyer from the neighbouring suburb of Russell Lea, thinks Morrison is unfairly criticised, and appreciates the job he did in guiding the country through the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic. “I know people whinge about bits and pieces, but really, in the scope of things he’s done pretty good,” she says. “I didn’t not work a day. My kid had daycare looked after. My husband had his job in construction. I look at myself and my family, [we were] all pretty safe during Covid.” For Sitou, an academic who lives in Homebush in the electorate, campaigning in the seat has meant juggling a mishmash of local issues which vary widely. While voters in Drummoyne might cite climate change as a key issue, head a little farther west and the issues on voters’ minds tend to stick to the central theme of the campaign: cost of living. “It’s really distinct,” she says. “Any smart campaign, you’ve got to target your messaging and issues you want to shine a light on. Overwhelmingly, the feedback I’m getting when I’m out doorknocking is different areas have different concerns.” In Burwood, Shelley Tan, a nurse, isn’t feeling full of confidence about Albanese, but says she’ll vote for Labor because she believes the party will do more to help lift wages. “We need a pay rise,” she says. “[Albanese] is not the greatest, but I’ve got no other choice, do I? I don’t want to vote for Scott Morrison.” That same sentiment pops up over and over again as you speak to voters across the west of Sydney. They may not like Scott Morrison, but they’re hardly overwhelmed with enthusiasm for what Labor is offering. It would also concern the opposition to hear that while many voters who Guardian Australia speaks to have listed healthcare – traditionally one of the party’s strengths – as a priority, they aren’t necessarily linking that to a Labor vote. Lucy, from Burwood, who declines to give her last name as she runs after her grandchildren through the park, is also a nurse. She wants the government to invest more money in healthcare, but also says she “trusts” Morrison to improve the sector. “Maybe I will choose Morrison, but I think after I choose him I hope something can improve,” she says. Reid has one of the highest Chinese-Australian voting populations in the country, and concern about the Morrison government’s handling of the relationship between both countries is also an issue that pops up repeatedly. “I’ve had enough with Scott,” Li Wu from Strathfield says. Wu voted for the Liberal party at the last election, but says she’s switching her vote as a result of the worsening trade standoff between both nations. “I really want the government to fix the relationship with China. That’s all,” she says. Sitou says it’s an issue that has continued to pop up during the campaign. She says the concern about “heightened rhetoric” around China is also pragmatic. “The main concern is the impact the heightened rhetoric has on people’s lives and also small businesses,” she said. “There’s quite a lot of small businesses in Burwood that have relationships with China, [and] their concern is what is this heightened rhetoric means for us and for our businesses.” But it’s also true that as you head into Reid’s more diverse pockets, the traditional attack lines on the prime minister that have been baked into mainstream discourse – Scotty from Marketing, the Liar from the Shire – seem less relevant. Sabita Banik and her husband, Subrata, both general practitioners from Strathfield, are eating lunch at Oporto in Strathfield as they explain that they don’t want to vote. Sabita is concerned about the cost of living because, she says, “the cost of everything is going up, but not our salaries”, but she doesn’t know anything about Albanese. On Morrison? “I like him. I see Scott all the time. I see his Facebook. His cooking. Cooking Indian dishes,” she says. Ashay Parulekar, who is voting in his first federal election after becoming a citizen, tells Guardian Australia he is voting for the Coalition in part because of the strength of the economy, and because of the government’s fostering of ties with India. “Definitely the relations with India and Australia has strengthened over the years,” he said. Parulekar came to Australia in 2015 and says he has seen “a drastic change” in the relationship between India and Australia. “The relations have gone amazing [since then].”",News/Australia news,"Undecided, uninterested, unsure: major parties vie to flip long-held seats of Reid and Parramatta",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/undecided-uninterested-unsure-major-parties-vie-to-flip-long-held-seats-of-reid-and-parramatta
5/16/2022,"Leon Cameron coached his last game on Sunday. He choked up as he addressed his players beforehand. He told them he had no silverware, but no regrets. “I’ll tell you the same thing I told you on day one,” he said. ‘She’s on.” But when Carlton slammed on four goals in the first 10 minutes, she was over. Afterwards, Cameron limped through a guard of honour of the league chief executive and both teams. He looked relieved. He looked exhausted. He is nearly 50, and has worked full time in football since he was 16. Coaching was “zapping”, he said. It was time to do something else with his life. The end of coaching tenures aren’t the savage affairs they used to be. They used to come with years of recrimination and bitterness. Wounds would never be healed. Many men were completely lost to football. These days, they’re cleaner. They’re mutual decisions. The coach isn’t sacked, and doesn’t quit. All parties read which way the wind is blowing. The departing press conference is amicable. Brad Scott’s departure at North Melbourne was in many ways the template, and at times almost felt like a job application. Cameron’s record was very good. He had lots of injuries and homesick players. But the Giants contended year after year. They were so close in the 2016 preliminary final, narrowly going down in one of the great games of the modern era. They were never really a ‘system’ team, particularly down back. But when they were really humming, they played some exquisite football. At times, it was like watching a flawless training session. They were an uncompromising, hard-nosed, line-pushing lot. In several finals – against Sydney in 2016 and the Bulldogs in 2019 – they brutalised their opposition. They had a knack of winning finals when no one gave them a prayer, most memorably against Collingwood in the 2019 preliminary final. In the dying minutes, they defended like crazy men in the puddles at the Punt Road end. When the siren sounded, the crowd groaned, an almighty brawl broke out in the Olympic Stand, and the Giants celebrated the most significant win in their history to a silent and sullen MCG. But they’ve been paddling this year. They put Adelaide to the sword a fortnight ago, but have otherwise been flat, unconvincing and in desperate need of a reset. Toby Greene’s brain fade in Tasmania last year cost them dearly. Against Geelong in Canberra, Cameron said they were boring. That was the game where he and the club knew it was the end of the road. They came to a mutual agreement. This is an industry, as the Giants boss said, that “death-rides coaches”. But his was a dignified end. The entire playing list, friends and family gathered around him. They’ve always been a club with a purpose, a hard edge and an identifiable brand. A lot of the credit for that should go to Cameron. In terms of securing a new coach, GWS now has a head-start on the competition. Nathan Buckley ruled himself out on the weekend. Astonishingly, James Hird is seen as a serious contender. But Alastair Clarkson is the name on football’s lips. At times, the obsession with Clarkson can be a bit much. Football history is littered with examples of coaches who were seen as Messiah figures, were lured with bucketloads of cash and didn’t work out. Some believe he lost his way in his final years at Hawthorn, that he gutted the list and their football was at times bordering on unwatchable. “I’m only coming back for another premiership,” he said this week. He reckons all 18 clubs are capable of winning a flag in the next few years. It’s a big call for anyone who watched Essendon or North Melbourne on the weekend. Essendon, in particular, looked like a team which could use a few Clarkson home truths on Saturday night. They registered a paltry 30 tackles. If he was coaching them, you suspect he’d have them leaping off freezing piers at five in the morning. Right now, Clarkson is having a whale of a time. He played Jeff Kennett and Hawthorn like a harp. They’re still paying him handsomely to swan around the world – studying, spruiking the game, rubbing shoulders with some of the best coaches in America. He can name his own price at any number of clubs. He has months to figure out what he wants to do, where he wants to live and whose playing list he fancies shipping into shape. A short man, he looms large over the entire competition.",Sport/Sport,Leon Cameron’s dignified GWS Giants exit fits his treasured tenure | Leon Cameron,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/16/leon-camerons-dignified-gws-giants-exit-fits-his-treasured-tenure
5/16/2022,"To marquee or not to marquee? That is the question for A-Leagues operators the Australian Professional Leagues. Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and Covid chaos, or to take arms against a sea of troubles? A key pillar in the league’s short-term strategy to emerge from its horror 2021-22 campaign was unveiled mid-week, as APL managing director Danny Townsend revealed that a list of 35 potential “world-class” signings had been earmarked by the league as potential “sugar hits” for what is hoped will be a reinvigorating 2022-23. It all sounds like something from a Hollywood film, Townsend sitting down with clubs and putting together a team to save the (A-Leagues) world. Yet surveying the landscape, it is easy to see why the immediate bounce which would come with this strategy is being pursued. Battling waning interest and emotional investment even before being buffeted by Covid headwinds that ripped their best-laid plans to pieces, none of the A-Leagues 12 men’s teams averaged more than 10,000 attendees this season and television ratings and fan interest have waned to dangerously low levels. What better way to drum up immediate curiosity than borrowing someone else’s fame? Per its executive, the APL will work with clubs this off-season to determine positions of need in their men’s or women’s teams before supporting them in signing a figure who both addresses this need and brings that sweet nectar of mainstream notoriety. These individuals would be recruited with both an understanding and contractual requirement that not only would they be providing their on-field talents, but also serving in an ambassadorial role – avoiding previous circumstances wherein marquee signings have been reluctant to do any media, which somewhat defeats the point. Now, with all this talk of sugar, the appeal of diving into the impending free-agent list on Transfermarkt and devolving into a sokkah version of Veruca Salt is a powerful one. “I want a Gareth Bale, Danny,” clubs may cry. “And I want a Cesc Fàbregas, and a Zlatan Ibrahimović.” And any such arrivals would be a positive, anything that would boost the league’s reputation right now would be. But Australian football has had a long and not always fruitful relationship with the marquee signing, the global superstar brought to these shores in an attempt to bathe the local game in the reflected glow of an already-established reputation and celebrity. At its core, they effectively boil down to endorsement deals, only instead of taking cash to spruik the benefits of petro-states with dubious human rights records or non-fungible tokens, the player in question is providing their endorsement of a footballing club and the league in which it plays. This inevitably carries some level of sacrifice on the part of the signing beyond a standard relocation; acknowledgement that they are now not so much a footballer who resides on the game’s biggest stage and more a brand deployed on rescue missions to its fringes. Some simply are not ready to do this, and others demand a significant premium for doing so. On occasion, it works great. Alessandro Del Piero at Sydney FC, Shinjo Ono at Western Sydney and Emile Heskey at Newcastle coincided with the A-League’s (unironic) peak. Crowds swelled and the mainstream couldn’t get enough. But these tenures ultimately did little to arrest the alarming backsliding in the years that followed after the rush from their presence wore off. The crescendo in the league’s active support and high point in technical and tactical approaches from teams that underpinned the Del Piero epoch was not fostered by the then Football Federation Australia. The governing body quandered a golden opportunity for the league to stand on its own feet. Now, Townsend insists the foundations now exist in the A-Leagues to allow the competition to capitalise on the sugar rush to come. And the APL is free to spend its money however it likes. It spent years telling the public it had the means and wherewithal to invest and invest well. Caveat emptor. New or old fans will enjoy bright lights, no doubt, and some will likely stick around. That’s good. But inevitably, the dwindling number of rusted-ons will at some point want more. And this is where the questions come in. Is the APL, in what would be a break with local tradition, capable of following through on a long-term strategy that would grow the game and allow the league to stand on its own two feet? Is there recognition of what fundamentally underpins the product (that’s the football bit) and how everything, ultimately, flows from that? For all the talk of data lakes and prevailing commercial eco-spaces, how will the emotional, irrational connection that underpins fans and their teams be fostered? Is the broadcaster at some point going to stop alienating fans trying to pay for and watch the product? These, among other topics, are the A-Leagues’ vegetables. It’s free to have all the sugar it wants and in the short term, will enjoy and probably benefit from the rush. At some point, it will have to eat its greens so it can grow up to be big and strong.",Sport/Football,Marquees are tasty sugar hits but A-Leagues must also eat their greens | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/16/marquees-are-tasty-sugar-hits-but-a-leagues-must-also-eat-their-greens
5/16/2022,"Julia Gillard has contributed a rare campaign endorsement for Katy Gallagher – the shadow finance minister – an intervention underscoring Labor’s concern that the high-profile independent David Pocock could split the progressive vote in Canberra. The former prime minister has written to the residents of the Australian Capital Territory and recorded a video endorsement for Gallagher, a former chief minister, who holds one of the territory’s two Senate spots. For the past 50 years, the two ACT Senate spots have been held by the Labor and Liberal parties but in 2022, two high-profile progressive independents, Pocock, a former rugby union star player, and constitutional law professor Kim Rubenstein are vying to replace the Liberal incumbent, Zed Seselja. The independent campaigns have high visibility around the national capital and both Pocock and Rubenstein are well-known locally. Labor strategists believe Pocock now has sufficient momentum to imperil Gallagher’s re-election bid in the event traditional Labor voters choose to mark him No 1 on the Senate ballot paper. The current Labor ACT chief minister Andrew Barr took to social media last week to tell residents he would be putting his own party at No 1 on the Senate ballot paper and Pocock at No 2 because it would be “great” if the two territory senators would back territory rights in the federal parliament. Barr noted that Labor was prepared to facilitate a vote in both the House and the Senate to lift the ban on territories legislating on euthanasia and “wouldn’t it be great if both ACT senators voted in favour of territory rights – that’s why I’ll be voting 1 Labor and 2 Pocock”. Gillard says in the new letter to residents she doesn’t usually “talk about politics” but Gallagher deserves the continuing support of the people of Canberra. “There’s been a lot of talk about independents recently,” Gillard says. “What our federal parliament needs is more strong, experienced women. And that’s why I believe the choice you face this election matters so much.” She says the voters of Canberra “have the opportunity to make sure we keep one of our best, brightest and strongest women in the Senate”. “Katy Gallagher is more than just a good friend to me, she is a strong advocate for the values that matter to Canberrans,” Gillard says. Gillard notes Gallagher’s positive record on Canberra’s transition to 100% renewable energy and her support for a federal anti-corruption body. The former prime minister notes if Labor wins the coming election, Gallagher will be the finance minister in an Albanese government. “That’s why I would encourage you to ask yourself this question before you cast your vote – can I really risk losing someone like Katy from the Senate? To me, the answer is clear, and that’s why I’m asking you to put Katy Gallagher number 1 on the Senate ballot paper”. Pocock, in a recent interview with Guardian Australia, said there was frustration in the city about being ignored because “we are such a safe seat, as a result of that we’ve had a huge underinvestment in infrastructure”. The high-profile independent, who has received funding from the Climate 200 group, has been the target of a negative advertising campaign run by the rightwing advocacy group, Advance Australia, centring on his record of environmental activism. A recent Redbridge robo-phone survey of voting intentions which was funded by the Pocock campaign had Labor at 27%, followed by the Liberals at 24% and Pocock at 21%.",News/Australia news,Julia Gillard makes rare appearance to back Katy Gallagher as Labor fears David Pocock upset,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/julia-gillard-makes-rare-appearance-to-back-katy-gallagher-as-labor-fears-david-pocock-upset
5/16/2022,"“Physician, heal thyself.” This proverb has been in use for at least 2,000 years, but it is relevant today, and it applies to me. I am dealing with burnout, and it has taken many months for me to realise it. The combination of a few years of a heavy workload, of ever-increasing demands, and limited opportunities to rest and recharge have taken their toll. The advent of a global pandemic has clearly contributed to all these factors. The scramble to ready our hospitals for a disease of high infectiousness and severity. The privilege and pain of caring for many who I watched die in 2020. The angst of dealing with vaccine refusers, and wave after wave of Covid cases, and new, often overwhelming demands on myself and my colleagues. They have laid siege to my energy and my empathy. The demands upon many of us in emergency medicine and nursing have to be seen to be believed. Their origins lie in a health system which treats emergency departments as a panacea for all its shortcomings: a disastrous aged care system, a general practice system which discourages the care of complex patients, a mental health system that is woefully under-resourced, and a federal/state health funding system where cost-shifting and finger-pointing are the reality. Emergency physicians have been talking about hospital overcrowding for more than 20 years, and burnout is nothing new among many of my medical, nursing and allied colleagues who have given so much to caring for people in the worst moments of their lives. But the overcrowding, the delays, and the adverse impacts on patients have never been as profound as they are now. Unsurprisingly, morale among my colleagues has taken an enormous hit. Burnout has not happened to me overnight. Rather, it has been a progressive erosion of my usual coping mechanisms, to the point where my physical and mental energy have become so much harder to find. Decisions and procedures that are usually second nature to me, now require considerable effort and cause more angst than they should. Joy has been hard to find, not only in my work – which should be very satisfying – but in most of the activities of my daily life. I cannot be unaffected by seeing people suffer on waiting room floors and ambulance stretchers, when I know I could help, if only I had the space and staff to do so. I am aware of the data that clearly shows that clinicians with burnout are impaired. We are less efficient, and we are much more likely to make mistakes. In my role, mistakes have the potential to be very serious . While many colleagues have been surprised to hear of my situation – I may be good at hiding personal distress – I have come to understand the impact of burnout on the people I love most. My family. I have often been irritable, distracted, and unable to give all of myself to them in the ways they need and deserve. That is probably the trigger that led me to take the advice of my psychologist, my GP and my emergency physician wife. To deal with my burnout before it deteriorates further. I have been advised to take leave from my clinical work for three months. That has been hard to accept, but I am so grateful to my colleagueswho have been supportive and understanding and sought to assuage the guilt I feel at the prospect of not being there to help with the extreme demands we are experiencing. I have chosen to speak about my circumstances publicly, because I hope that it will give permission to many healthcare workers to give a higher priority to their own self-care. In that, they are being professional and ethical, doing their best to be safe and effective in their work and making their careers sustainable. I speak out because the most enduring solution to healthcare worker burnout is to address the daunting problems in the Australian health system which cause it in the first place. We are in a federal election campaign and yet the offerings of our political leaders for health system reform and enhancement have been evasive or superficial. I hope that changes in the weeks ahead. As I step back from the frontline for a while, I look forward to the rest and reflection that I need. I don’t know how my time away will change me, but I hope to be able to return as a wiser, better man, able to care for many. Including myself.

5/16/2022,"A member of the administrative appeals tribunal has said he was benched from hearing social security cases because he decided too many against the government. Michael Manetta says the AAT deputy president, Karen Synon, a former Liberal senator, expressed concern in June 2021 about the number of appeals against his decisions by the Department of Social Services before he was benched in September in a bid to increase “consistency” between tribunal members’ decisions. After months of internal complaints Manetta has blown the whistle on a move he called “completely incompatible with the rule of law” that “undermines the impartiality and independence of the tribunal”. Synon told Guardian Australia she categorically denies “any implication or inference that I have acted in any manner that is not fair, impartial and just in the exercise of my statutory duties at the AAT”. The AAT is an independent tribunal that conducts merit reviews of government decisions, such as DSS decisions to refuse welfare payments or to recoup jobseeker and jobkeeper overpayments. The AAT was the forum in which welfare recipients argued against robodebts before the government later conceded after court action that the process of raising debts based on income-averaging was unlawful. Manetta told Guardian Australia “exactly the same” dynamic is at play in a variety of other social security decisions, in which he has rejected the department’s interpretation of the law on a number of points that have never been definitively decided on appeal. Although not on the same “catastrophic” scale of the robodebt scandal, which resulted in the government paying out a $1.8bn settlement, Manetta warned there were many more “unresolved potential time bombs” litigated in the AAT’s social security division. These include what compensation moneys are counted when calculating the preclusion period before an injured person can receive welfare and time limits for the department to recover allegedly overpaid jobseeker and jobkeeper payments. Manetta, a part-time member first appointed in May 2016, said of the 300 decisions he has made, 24 have been appealed, a level he described as “hardly controversial”. Only nine appeals were successful. Manetta was reappointed for a further five-year term in May 2021, after a positive performance review by a retired federal judge, he said. But in June, Synon queried the number of appeals against Manetta’s decisions, he said. “I said it should be a matter of indifference to members whether parties appeal,” he said. “They have a right to do that but I stand by my decisions.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning According to Manetta, he and Synon discussed the possibility of setting up an appeal panel to hear cases involving “errors of law of a recurrent nature” but the idea “came to nothing”. In September, Manetta was removed from social security cases and given only child support cases, which are revenue-neutral for the government. Manetta objected in writing to Synon, the AAT president and later to the acting president. In February 2022, Manetta spoke to Synon about being benched and she said “she was concerned at the high level of my decisions against the department (around 65%) as out of kilter with most of the other members”, he said. “She wanted consistency of decision-making across the division.” But Manetta said that decision was “entirely incompatible with the rule of law”. “We’re independent adjudicative officers. You can’t take sides, you can’t even start with a presumption that the government’s interpretation of the law is probably right.” Manetta also claimed that at this meeting Synon revealed the secretary of the DSS had met with the AAT president and Synon about one of his decisions. Manetta said he was “staggered” a party before the tribunal was given “special access” rather than making representations at the ministerial level. Manetta refused to do only child support work, and was delisted, meaning he is not currently hearing cases despite holding an appointment to May 2026. He complained again to the new AAT president, Justice Fiona Meagher, on 19 April, receiving an acknowledgement but “nothing since”. “I believe that the removal of competent decision-makers because of the trend of their decisions is an affront to fundamental principles of fairness; it undermines the perception of impartiality and independence which is essential to the work of the tribunal; it offends the rule of law and erodes public confidence in the quality of administrative justice.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Manetta, a barrister and former South Australian state Liberal candidate, said his complaint “isn’t about politics”, but it is “essential” that only lawyers should be appointed to the AAT. An AAT spokesperson said “the president is aware of matters raised by member Michael Manetta and these are currently being considered in consultation with deputy president Synon”. Jo Dyer, the independent candidate for Boothby, said Manetta’s complaint “goes to the heart of how this government serves the people of Australia, in this case some of the most vulnerable people … those reliant on social security who believe they have been wronged by the government”. “These people have every right to appeal government decisions … if they do so, they should be able to expect fairness and rely on the rule of law. “After its heroic role in revealing the illegality at the heart of the government’s robodebt scandal … the AAT has now been compromised.” Synon said it was “inappropriate for me to respond to questions about a member within my division” beyond her denial of any improper conduct. The DSS denied meeting with senior tribunal members to discuss. Manetta’s decisions. “This is incorrect,” a spokesperson said. “The secretary of the department has a regular meeting with senior members of the AAT as part of routine of stakeholder engagement to discuss strategic issues and changes in policy that may impact on the AAT.” “There is no discussion about the actions of any member of the AAT or specific cases during these meetings. This would be improper.”",News/Australia news,AAT member says he was benched after too many decisions against government,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/aat-member-says-he-was-benched-after-too-many-decisions-against-government
5/16/2022,"In 1936, during the first heady months of France’s new Popular Front government, a Parisian schoolteacher coined the phrase that symbolised the hopes invested in it. “Tout est possible!” (Everything is possible) wrote Marceau Pivert in an editorial for the Socialist party newspaper of the time. As fascism overwhelmed the continent, it proved a tragically over-optimistic assessment. Divided over how to respond to the threat, by 1938 the leftwing coalition of socialists and communists governing the country had fractiously fallen apart. The challenges facing the contemporary French left pale somewhat in comparison. But they also have to do with problems of unity – or the lack of it – and with the growing popularity of the modern far right. The absence of a united front in the recent presidential race led once more to dispiriting defeat and, in the case of the Socialist party candidate, Anne Hidalgo, outright humiliation. Representing the traditional party of the centre-left, Ms Hidalgo scored a mere 1.75%. The Greens performed marginally better (4.6%), but only the most radical candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, made a fight of it. Campaigning on a hard-left and markedly Eurosceptic platform, Mr Mélenchon almost matched Marine Le Pen’s score in the first round. Some more moderate supporters voted for him as the only leftwing candidate with a realistic chance of success. Something had to be done after the latest disappointment – and was done with surprising rapidity. Ahead of next month’s legislative elections, a new “popular union” has been agreed, which will run a common slate of leftwing candidates. The lion’s share of seats will be contested by Mr Mélenchon’s La France Insoumise party, with Green and Socialist candidates fighting most of the rest. Current polls suggest that the New People’s Ecologist and Social Union (Nupes) has a good chance of becoming the main opposition to President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist bloc in the national assembly. In a political landscape divided almost equally between the left, the centre and the right, the consolidation of the progressive vote is overdue. But this fragile coalition has been formed almost entirely on Mr Mélenchon’s terms. In Paris, for example, which has remained a bastion of the Socialists, Ms Hidalgo’s colleagues will be allowed to contest only two of 20 seats. Senior Socialist figures, such as former French president François Hollande, have voiced dismay at a common programme that pledges to ignore Brussels rules on debt and deficits. Other policies include reintroducing the wealth tax abolished during Mr Macron’s first term, lowering the retirement age to 60, and a price freeze to address the cost of living crisis. It is a radical agenda, some of which is at odds with what the centre-left campaigned for only a few weeks ago. His rivals having performed so poorly, Mr Mélenchon has the Socialists and Greens over a barrel as they seek to salvage something from the wreckage. But it will require impressive diplomatic skills to hold the new grouping together, and it is not clear that La France Insoumise’s leader possesses them. Mr Mélenchon is a charismatic but polarising figure, whose Euroscepticism and hostility to French membership of Nato may be difficult for his new allies to swallow. Divisions may therefore be papered over rather than resolved, but the popular union is nevertheless a positive development. The presidential election campaign was notable for a stark rightwards drift, in relation to race and immigration in particular. As twin economic and environmental crises are confronted, French democracy needs a left that can make its progressive voice count in the public square. It may be a rocky ride to come, but a necessary first step has been taken to achieve that.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the newly united French left: beyond the fragments | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/15/the-guardian-view-on-the-newly-united-french-left-beyond-the-fragments
5/16/2022,"Voters in Lebanon have gone to the polls in the first national election since a disastrous economic collapse and an explosion that wrecked the Beirut waterfront in 2020, amid low expectations that the leaders they hold responsible will face a serious challenge to their stranglehold on the country. A number of civil society candidates lined up against an entrenched ruling elite with pledges to change a political landscape in which feudal lords and their networks have enriched themselves since the end of the civil war. The chances of a real breakthrough appeared slim as the polls closed on Sunday evening, with the most likely outcome being a return to some form of the status quo, where power is apportioned along established sectarian lines, with existing control structures barely diluted. In the run-up to the election, the former prime minister and leader of Lebanon’s Sunni Muslim community, Saad Hariri, had urged a voter boycott, and many of his followers appeared to pay heed, with low turnout in Sunni parts of the country amid a modest turnout nationwide. Many polling stations were without electricity and some were short on ballot papers, in a microcosm of the country’s continuing disintegration under fuel and power shortages, and hyperinflation as the local currency continues to lose value. At some polling centres, there was no shortage of the precious commodity of fresh dollars, which had been used to lure the support of last-minute voters, particularly families who had arrived with multiple members. “They have to give me something,” said one woman at a west Beirut polling station. “What else am I going to get from these people?” At another polling station in the Keserwan region, one voter, Joseph Karam, 41, said he had considered voting for civil society candidates, but had decided to cast his ballot for the Lebanese Forces, a civil-war-era party that has been resurgent in recent years and has won the patronage of Gulf states for its willingness to confront Lebanon’s dominant political bloc, Hezbollah. A total of 718 candidates from 15 electoral districts were running for seats in the 128-member parliament. Going into the poll, Hezbollah and its allies retained 71 seats. Their support base was expected to hold firm against a handful of secular Shia candidates and a push by mainstream parties backed by western states. The Lebanese Association for Democratic Elections said its delegates had been forced to withdraw from two polling stations after threats by Hezbollah supporters and their allies in the Shia Amal group. While fistfights were reported at some booths, and there were claims of harassment by rival blocs at other locations, the poll seemed to have defied predictions of more serious unrest. “The issue now is counting these ballots,” said Anwar Habib, a voter from the southern city of Sidon. “This is not a secure process. Hezbollah and Amal will do anything they can to win.” Preliminary results were expected by Monday. Weeks of political horse-trading are then expected before a government is formed.",News/World news,Lebanon votes in first national election since onset of economic crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/lebanon-votes-polls-national-election-parliament
