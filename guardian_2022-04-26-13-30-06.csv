4/26/2022,"The arboreal corridor around the River Wharfe is bright with the sharp, tangy colours of April: the fresh lemon-and-lime fuzz of hawthorn budburst; the icy white of wood anemones; the acidic yellow of willow catkins. There is a gauzy delicacy to it all, with the sunlight diffused through a sheet of high cloud. Much of the wider landscape is still thin and pallid from winter, but these first stabs of colour have a vitality that startles and surprises me, as they somehow do every year. After few weeks of cold, volatile weather, serenity and sunshine have returned, suddenly uncorking the energy of spring again. I take a closer look at the river and, sure enough, what I hope to find is there: a constant flow of small brown insects flying upstream, travelling just above the surface of the water, like a soft horizontal snow. I have noticed this phenomenon on April days like this in previous years. It can only be seen during a window of around a fortnight, and it seems to require the air to be windless and the water still. I’m no entomological expert, but I have consulted people who are, and it seems likely to be the mass hatching of grannoms (Brachycentrus subnubilis), a type of caddisfly. These small, moth-like insects have a fascinating infancy within the river. As larvae, they wrap themselves in a protective tubular silk case, which they augment with scraps of vegetation and debris, arranged in a specific ornate pattern. Once ready, a rise in water temperature triggers the pupae to float to the surface in vast numbers and emerge into the air as adults. Some species of caddis use their discarded shells as a raft, floating on the surface until they’re dry enough to take flight. Individually, these might be inconspicuous creatures, but the vast scale of their emergence is quietly spectacular. For days on end, hundreds stream past every minute, and slacker sections of the water simmer with ripples as the bugs take flight, falling upwards into spring.  With thanks to Matt Shardlow and Craig Macadam",News/Environment,Country diary: A mass hatching rises from the river,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/26/country-diary-a-mass-hatching-rises-from-the-river
4/26/2022,"A bare few miles inside Australian waters, the dark nearly absolute, a small fishing vessel sat low in the ocean, waiting to be boarded by the Australian navy. Maikel Husa, a slightly built boy of just 15, was among those watching as the patrol boat approached. Husa had been deceived. He left his village on Sulawesi for Java on the promise of paid work transporting goods. The captain instead took on 58 asylum seekers, destined for Australia. When they were intercepted north of Ashmore Reef, in the dying hours of New Year’s Eve 2009, one of first things the Australians asked him was his age. Husa, afraid and far from home, told them he was a child. “I said I was born in 1994,” he recalls. He would soon tell immigration officials and federal police the same thing. Husa told the Australians he just wanted to go home. That’s exactly where he should have been sent, according to federal police policy on juvenile people smugglers. Instead, he would spend years behind bars in maximum security prisons in Australia, held as an adult aged 19. Husa is one of dozens of children, some as young as 13 when they were detained, who were wrongly prosecuted as adult people smugglers using deeply flawed evidence to show how old they were. The boys were jailed in Western Australia’s adult correctional system before being released years later and quietly sent back to Indonesia. On Tuesday, Husa and five others won a remarkable victory. Despite the passage of more than a decade since their conviction, they argued successfully for the WA court of appeal to hear their cases and quash their convictions, overcoming a refusal by the former attorney general Christian Porter to refer them for a fresh appeal. “I can say there were systemic failures at every step for these children,” their lawyer, Mark Barrow, of Ken Cush & Associates, says. “In the end, the six acquittals stand as truth of the injustices.” The court found a “substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred” and found that, without the X-ray evidence, all six boys would “not have been charged as an adult”. The court said commonwealth prosecutors now acknowledged their earlier reliance on the wrist X-ray technique “gives rise to a serious doubt about the integrity” of the convictions and left “no reliable evidence” to sentence the boys as adults. “The Crown has conceded that a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by each of the convictions; the judgments of conviction should be set aside; and judgments of acquittal should be entered,” the court said. The case has done much more than simply clear the boys’ names. It has exposed hundreds of pages of internal records, which for the first time reveal the full story of Australia’s shocking conduct, including the extent to which police knew there were questions about the accuracy of the evidence they were using to prosecute the children as adults. The documents tell the story of six children lured from isolated fishing villages with vague promises of work on boats, only to become collateral damage in a government’s desperate attempt to appear tough on borders. Interview transcripts and affidavits show the boys told anyone who would listen – navy, immigration, police – that they were under 18. But in nearly all the cases the Australian Federal Police instead relied on reports from a doctor who said he could help determine a person’s age using X-rays of their wrists. Seven years later, his evidence in a similar prosecution would be criticised by appeal judges as “unsatisfactory and unreliable” and as having “no acceptable basis in fact”. The Guardian can now reveal that both police and senior government figures were told before the six boys were convicted that there were serious questions about the technique’s accuracy. Internal police notes show an investigating officer working on some of the cases had been involved in a remarkably similar prosecution eight years earlier, during which doubts were raised about the accuracy of using wrist X-ray evidence. The courts in that case heard that using the technique to determine age was “not an exact science” and open to error, and that the key reference tool on which it depended should be used with “judicious scepticism”. These doubts did not stop police relying on wrist X-rays when they arrested the six boys in 2009. Instead, internal records show, police altered the dates of birth the boys gave them – adjusting the year, but keeping the month and day – to make their ages fit the X-ray evidence and to prosecute them as adults. The new dates, described by the boys’ lawyers in court as “fictitious”, were used on sworn legal documents. The prosecutions continued even after the immigration department warned the government about the reliability of the X-ray technique, pointing out the UK considered it “an inexact science” with a “margin of error [that] can sometimes be as much as five years either side”. That warning was given before five of the six children were convicted as adults in the WA district court. In two cases, those of Hamzah Gogo, 15, and Muhammad Maleng, 13, the warning came just a month before they were sentenced to five years in adult prisons. The government did nothing to intervene. Now, senior legal figures are calling for an independent inquiry into the actions of police. The retired New South Wales supreme court judge Anthony Whealy says the AFP’s decision to rely on the wrist X-ray evidence, despite questions about its reliability, was “deeply concerning”. “Incarceration of juveniles in adult prisons is a matter of the gravest concern, both domestically and internationally.” At 13, Rudi Usman was the youngest of the six. Usman left school after his fourth year and had spent much of his young life working on fishing boats in Oebobo, a village of about 1,000 people on the outskirts of Kupang, on the western part of Timor. Before his voyage to Australia, he earned the equivalent of about $13 a month, almost all of which went to his parents. In December 2009 he was asked to help crew a boat carrying timber. He would be paid 2m rupiah – about $250 – an amount that would transform his family’s circumstances. It was only once he was on board that he discovered the boat was carrying passengers – 53 Afghans, mainly Hazaras – bound for Australia. Twenty-two miles north of Ashmore Reef, Usman’s boat was intercepted by an Australian customs vessel. Taken to Christmas Island, he told police he was born on 12 February 1996, making him 13. But the date of birth he gave to police was altered. The new date – 12 February 1991 – appeared on sworn legal documents. That made him 18, aligning with the findings of the wrist X-ray, and allowing him to be prosecuted as an adult. Usman was sentenced to serve five years in an adult prison, the mandatory minimum introduced by the Howard government. Maikel Husa’s date of birth was similarly altered. He told the Australian authorities he was born on 1 January 1994, but police changed it to 1 January 1990. “This is not true,” he says. “I didn’t tell anyone in Australia that was my date of birth.” Husa, like all but one of the boys, pleaded guilty, and his lawyers did not contest the evidence about his age. Only one of the six Indonesians, Muhammed Maleng, gave authorities any reason to believe he was an adult, initially telling police he was 13, before saying he was much older because he “thought it would help me if I was much older. I made up my age.” Husa was sent to maximum security prisons, where he spent more than two years among some of WA’s most dangerous criminals. The adult inmates of Perth’s Hakea jail had a nickname for him – “the boy”. “I asked why and they said because I looked so young. Vandi was broke when a vague offer to work on a boat landed in his lap in 2009. Born on the island of Binongko, the 17-year-old farm worker and fisher had never travelled out of sight of his birthplace. He would soon find himself detained on an Australian navy vessel off Browse Island, north-west of the Kimberley coast. “I was asked how old I was,” he says. “I said I was 17 years old and born in the year 1992.” He told immigration officials and police the same. Three days later, police charged him as an adult. The prosecution notice and indictment, both sworn documents, listed his date of birth as 17 March 1990, giving him an age of 19, which fitted with the X-ray evidence of the Perth-based radiologist Dr Vincent Low. Low’s report, seen by the Guardian, told police that “complete fusion has occurred at all examined growth plates. This indicates skeletal maturity and therefore a skeletal age of 19 years or greater.” Police and prosecutors should have had reason to question the evidence. Other experts they had used had expressed concerns about the limits of using wrist X-rays to determine age, including Dr Sven Thonnell, whom commonwealth prosecutors had used repeatedly. “It really doesn’t help at all in determining the chronological age or the skeletal age,” Thonnell said in giving evidence in a 2002 case. Immigration officials had also sounded the alarm internally about the use of such X-rays. In June 2010, eight months before Vandi went to trial, the immigration department provided a briefing to senior government ministers. It warned that wrist X-rays could have an error range of at least two years either way. Interpreting wrist X-rays, the department warned, was highly subjective. Different experts could interpret the same image differently. The department also pointed the ministers to the UK’s official guidelines on the practice. They were unequivocal. “The issue of whether chronological age can be determined from the estimate of bone age has been discussed at great length in the literature,” the guidelines said. “The answer is that it cannot.” The briefing was provided well after Low’s reports to police. But it prompted no intervention from the government in Vandi’s case, nor in any of the others. In 2002, seven years before the arrest of Vandi and the other five boys, a remarkably similar case came before the courts. Federal police were attempting to convince the WA children’s court to let them prosecute an Indonesian boy, who insisted he was 15, as an adult people smuggler. The boy had repeatedly told authorities he was not an adult. But, just as they would in 2010, police relied on a wrist X-ray, interpreted by Low, who concluded the boy was likely to be over 18. Low’s technique involved inspecting an X-ray of an accused’s wrist and comparing it against a reference tool for skeletal maturity, known as the Greulich and Pyle Atlas. The reference tool was built largely from the bones of healthy, middle-class Americans. He relied on the tool to say that, on average, skeletal maturity occurs at 19 years old. During the 2002 proceedings, Low himself conceded it was “not an exact science” and there was a “possibility of error” in conducting X-ray comparisons. The court heard that the authors of the GP Atlas had warned it should be used with “judicious scepticism”. The authors said the tool was meant to be used only to estimate a person’s skeletal maturity, rather than their actual age, and said there was a tendency to attribute it a greater precision than they had ever intended. While the court accepted the doctor’s evidence, it found, given the potential uncertainty and the defendant’s insistence he was a child, that the boy was probably under 18. The AFP brought its own appeal to the WA supreme court, saying the judge had not given enough weight to Low’s evidence, but the appeal was dismissed. The supreme court judge said Low’s evidence must be read subject to “the cautions and warnings to which I have referred contained in the Atlas on which the evidence was based and must be read subject also to the qualification which Dr Low gave about his own evidence”. Yet, seven years later, the AFP again relied on the wrist X-rays to charge Vandi and the other five boys as adults. AFP case notes, seen by the Guardian, show one member of the investigative team for some of the cases in 2010 was closely involved in the 2002 case that raised serious questions about the accuracy of the practice Vandi’s age was raised at his trial, but the court ultimately deemed him an adult. It would take more than two years for the then federal attorney general, Nicola Roxon, to release on licence 15 children who had been convicted, due to concerns about their age. Cases were dropped against a further 48 children who had been charged and remanded in adult jails, where they had spent on average 199 days. One, Ali Jasmin, had his conviction overturned in 2017. Jasmin’s case led the way for the current group of six. It also prompted a landmark class action against the Australian government by 122 people who said they were detained or prosecuted as adults for suspected people smuggling. In overturning Jasmin’s conviction, the WA court of appeal was scathing of Low’s evidence. “Low’s opinion that, at the time of the alleged offence, there was a 24% chance that the appellant was aged 18 years or younger may have been plausible at the trial, by virtue of its precision and the confidence with which it was expressed,” the judges ruled. “But in truth it had no acceptable basis in fact or by reference to generally accepted scientific methodology. Dr Low’s opinion was unsatisfactory and unreliable.” In 2012 the Australian Human Rights Commission released a scathing report, An Age of Uncertainty, which found the method was “inherently flawed”, because, among other things, there was no constant relationship between age and skeletal maturity, and the technique took no account of differences between Indonesian populations and those used as the basis for the GP Atlas. Other experts told the AHRC more than half of all men achieved skeletal maturity before the age of 18. Low did not respond to a request for comment. But in a submission to the AHRC inquiry that led to the report, he defended his methods, saying they were based on an exhaustive dataset and a widely used method to analyse a person’s skeletal maturity. Low said other studies showed there was no difference in skeletal development based on ethnicity and people from backgrounds with poorer nutrition were likely to develop more slowly, meaning the technique would tend to identify them as younger, rather than older. He said his opinions left open the possibility that subjects were under the age of 18. “My opinion and testimony introduces a realistic appraisal of the possibility of the subject being less than 18 years of age due to the normal variation in human physiology,” he said. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists, of which Low is a fellow, wrote to the government in 2011, well after his evidence in these cases, urging it to abandon the use of wrist X-rays for age determination. “We advise you that these methods are unreliable and untrustworthy when used as criminal evidence in a court of law,” the college said. The practice is now completely discredited and no longer used. Two memories burn brightly in Colin Singer’s mind when he recalls 27 April 2010. Singer, an independent prison visitor in Perth, had arrived at Hakea prison, ready to help anyone who might need him. Waiting for him were the prison’s superintendent, deputy superintendent and chaplain. “Excuse me, sir, I think we have a problem,” they told him. Singer was taken to the prison’s medical director. The doctor was distressed. He handed Singer a piece of paper, with a series of names highlighted. “He had this piece of paper in front of him, and it had the names of all the prisoners they were doing the medicals on,” Singer says. “He had highlighted them and then he had just written across this thing, ‘THEY’RE KIDS’.” Some of the children, the doctor said, were prepubescent. Singer can still recall seeing Ali Jasmin for the first time. “I remember going and there’s this tiny kid, just holding on to this fence. I remember going up to him and saying, ‘Hey mas, are you Ali Jasmin?’ “He just burst into tears.” At first, Singer thought the mistake would quickly be corrected. He raised it the same day with the office of the inspector of custodial services and the Indonesian consulate. “I was an idiot. I thought this is so bad, come tomorrow morning, everything’s going to be fixed. Ten years later, we’re still fighting the same thing.” Singer tried to protect the children. He watched their cases through the courts, advocated for their release, publicly and privately, and began flying to Albany, where some of the children were transferred, at his own expense. “The key thing is, from day one, everyone knew they were kids,” he says. In An Age of Uncertainty, the AHRC said the Australian government’s treatment of children caught up in smuggling operations was “disturbing” and that “Australian authorities apparently gave little weight to the rights of this cohort of young Indonesians”. “Each of the Australian Federal Police, the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney-General’s Department engaged in acts and practices that led to contraventions of fundamental rights … such as the right to a fair trial.” The commission said agencies laboured under heavy workloads, with difficult investigations and limited resources, leading to poor practices. “Others, however, seem best explained by insufficient resilience in the face of political and public pressure to ‘take people smuggling seriously’; a pressure which seems to have contributed to a high level of scepticism about statements made by young crew on the boats carrying asylum seekers to Australia that they were under the age of 18 years.” One Indonesian national, whose case was abandoned because the commonwealth could not establish he was over 18, was incarcerated for more than two years – of which more than 21 months was spent in an adult jail – before he was released without any conviction and allowed to return home. Maikel Husa has been home nearly a decade now. He is married and his daughter will turn two next month. He has rebuilt his life and, like others, says he does not like to think about his time in Australia. “When I got home, I worked as a fisherman on a small boat. I still do this. I didn’t like what happened to me in Australia.”",News/Australia news,‘Systemic failures at every step’: the Indonesian children Australia sent to adult jails for years,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/systemic-failures-at-every-step-the-indonesian-children-australia-sent-to-adult-jails-for-years
4/26/2022,"Uber faces a $26m fine after the ride share company admitted engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct over its cancellation fee warnings and taxi fare estimates. Under Uber’s policies, people have five minutes from the time a driver has accepted a ride to cancel it without incurring a fee. However, between December 2017 and September 2021, the ride share app warned users who went to cancel a ride that they “may be charged a small fee since your driver is already on their way” even within the five-minute window. The message was shown for people booking UberX, Uber Premier and Uber Comfort rides. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said more than 2 million Australians were shown this misleading warning. Uber has since admitted its mistake and fixed the message. “Uber admits it misled Australian users for a number of years, and may have caused some of them to decide not to cancel their ride after receiving the cancellation warning, even though they were entitled to cancel free of charge under Uber’s own policy,” the ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said. Since September last year, the message has advised users they won’t be charged within the free cancellation period. The ACCC is also taking Uber to court over its Uber Taxi ride option, which the watchdog says overinflated the estimated cost, meaning the actual fare was cheaper than Uber’s lowest estimate. The ride option was only available in Sydney, and was removed in August 2020. “Digital platforms like Uber need to take adequate measures to monitor the accuracy of their algorithms and the accuracy of statements they make, which may affect what service consumers choose. This is particularly important as online businesses often carefully design their user interfaces to influence consumer behaviour,” Cass-Gottlieb said. Uber said in a blog post on the matter it had “worked to streamline” its in-app messages since the ACCC raised it, and despite the warning message, most users still ultimately cancelled their ride without charge. “Over time we have constantly evolved our offering, looking for ways to create better customer experiences, trial new products and invest in our technology,” Uber said. “We are committed to continually raising the bar – for ourselves, our industry, and most importantly for the people who use our services.”Uber is not fighting the court action. The ACCC and Uber have agreed to jointly seek orders, including for Uber to pay $26m in penalties. However, it will be for the court to decide if the penalties are appropriate.",News/Australia news,Uber faces $26m fine in Australia over misleading cancellation warnings and taxi fare estimates,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/uber-faces-26m-fine-in-australia-over-misleading-cancellation-fee-charges-and-taxi-fare-estimates
4/26/2022,"New South Wales public school teachers will strike next Wednesday after a unanimous vote by the union state executive, amid major concerns over wages and conditions. Teachers will also be allowed to walk off school grounds when any state government MP is visiting – the first time this kind of action has been rubber-stamped in at least a decade. Members will also refuse to implement any new government departmental policy or initiative that had been due to be introduced at the start of term two. The NSW Teachers Federation president, Angelo Gavrielatos, said he had been left with no options after the premier, Dominic Perrottet, “failed” to negotiate a better deal for teachers who have dealt with a raft of Covid-related challenges this year. “If we don’t pay teachers what they are worth, we won’t get the teachers we need,” Gavrielatos said. “Acting on uncompetitive salaries and unsustainable workloads is the only way to stop more teachers leaving and attract the people into the profession we need to fix the shortages. “The profession is now left with no alternative but to act in the interest of our students and our profession, and take industrial action.” He urged members to “make May 4 too loud to ignore”. Teachers last went on strike in December, before suspending planned industrial actions for term 1 due to spiralling Covid cases. A poll of 10,000 teachers, released on Tuesday, found almost three-quarters of respondents had an unmanageable workload while nine out of 10 said their pay did not reflect their expertise and responsibilities. Seven in 10 were reconsidering their positions due to workload. The teaching workforce has been under pressure in recent years due to issues exacerbated by Covid, including staff being forced to work outside their specialties to cover shortfalls and some schools returning to remote learning. The state is also facing a severe secondary teacher shortage, with unreleased federal government modelling suggesting the state will be short-staffed by 1,700 educators within three years.",News/Australia news,NSW teachers to strike next week over pay and conditions ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/nsw-teachers-to-strike-next-week-over-pay-and-conditions
4/26/2022,"Six Indonesian children wrongly jailed in Australia as adult people smugglers have cleared their names in a case exposing a grave and “substantial miscarriage of justice”. The six Indonesians, aged between 13 and 17 at the time of their arrest, were intercepted on fishing boats in Australian waters in 2009, during the highly charged political climate around border protection. The children had been lured on to the boats from their impoverished villages with vague offers of highly paid work, often unaware of their destination or that they were to transport asylum seekers. Internal records seen by the Guardian show the children repeatedly told immigration officials and police they were children, which ordinarily would have meant they were sent home under Australian Federal Police policy. Instead, police relied on the use of X-rays to interpret the maturity of their wrists, comparing them to a reference tool built using the bones of healthy, middle-class Americans. The X-rays were used to conclude that the boys were likely to be adults, and police charged them as such. All but one of the boys pleaded guilty. That technique has since been completely discredited. On Tuesday, the WA court of appeal overturned the convictions of Rudi Usman, Hamzah Gogo, Muhammad Maleng, Maikel Husa, Usman Ari and Vandi, who were represented by Ken Cush & Associates. The court found “a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred”. The court found that, without the wrist X-ray evidence, all six boys would “not have been charged as an adult” and the WA district court would have had no jurisdiction to deal with their cases. “The cogency of the remaining available evidence, as to the date of birth of each appellant, cannot support a finding that, at the material time, any of the appellants was of or over the age of 18 years,” it found. The court said commonwealth prosecutors had now conceded their earlier reliance on the wrist X-ray evidence “gives rise to a serious doubt about the integrity of each plea of guilty and about the integrity of each decision not to put in issue the appellant’s age”. “The Crown has conceded that a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by each of the convictions; the judgments of conviction should be set aside; and judgments of acquittal should be entered,” the court said. “The Crown accepts that there was no reliable evidence when each appellant was convicted and sentenced that he was of or over the age of 18 years.” Documents attached to the boys’ case reveal both police and senior government figures knew before the boys were jailed that there were doubts about its accuracy. Documents seen by the Guardian show an investigating officer in some of the cases had been involved in a remarkably similar prosecution eight years earlier, during which the court heard that using wrist X-ray evidence to determine age was open to error and “not an exact science”, and that the key reference tool on which it depended should be used with “judicious scepticism”. Despite those concerns, police altered the dates of birth provided to them by the six children – changing the year of birth, but keeping the month and date – to turn them into adults and make their ages fit the X-ray reports. The new dates, which the boys’ lawyers told the court were “fictitious”, were used in prosecution notices, indictments and other sworn legal documents to prosecute the children as adults. An internal immigration department briefing from June 2010 shows the government was directly warned about the reliability of the technique. That briefing occurred well before five of the six children were convicted and sentenced, but after the X-ray reports were produced. The briefing warned the government that wrist X-rays were prone to error and pointed to UK guidelines warning against using them to determine age, which said: “The issue of whether chronological age can be determined from the estimate of bone age has been discussed at great length in the literature. The answer is that it cannot.” After about three years and multiple complaints about the detention of children in adult jails, they were released on licence and sent home. Many were not told they were being released due to doubts about the evidence. They remained convicted people smugglers who were still technically serving their sentence. In 2012, the Australian Human Rights Commission investigated the detention of children on people-smuggling charges and delivered a scathing report, titled An Age of Uncertainty, which said Australia’s treatment of such children was “disturbing” and that “Australian authorities apparently gave little weight to the rights of this cohort of young Indonesians”. The then human rights commissioner Catherine Branson told the Guardian she thought at the time the government agencies responsible for investigating and prosecuting smuggling felt they were under political pressure. “I concluded that these agencies wanted to be seen to be bringing prosecutions and securing significant penalties,’’ she said. “They wanted to be seen to be taking people-smuggling seriously. “They wanted to find some way to determine age; there was a high level of anxiety to find a biological marker that could tell you precisely how old a person was, but, in the end, their reliance on the wrist X-rays proved to be ill-founded.” At the time, Branson, now chancellor of the University of Adelaide, considered it likely that many of the young people crewing people-smuggling boats were “in a sense, victims themselves”. “They were mainly from remote Indonesian islands, from impoverished backgrounds,” she said. “If someone approached these young people, offering what was to them an enormous amount of money, and all they have to do is come sailing for a few days, of course they would accept. “Many of them appeared to have had no idea what they were part of; they were already out at sea when they learned that passengers were on board, they couldn’t get back, there was then nothing they could do. The ringleaders in all of this were, by the time the vessels reached Australian waters, far away. “It seemed pretty clear to me many of these young people were victims too.” Andreas Schloenhardt, a professor of criminal law at the University of Queensland, has written extensively on the criminalisation of people smuggling by Australia and the mandatory minimum penalties that severely limited sentencing discretion. He argues that they forced judges to impose harsh sentences they considered to be disproportionate to the culpability of offenders, a fact acknowledged by some judges themselves. The prosecution of alleged people smugglers was influenced by a “great deal of misleading political and media rhetoric … myths and stereotypes about people smuggling and people smugglers”, he wrote in the Sydney Law Review in 2016. Schloenhardt told the Guardian a confluence of pressures was brought to bear on different government agencies as the number of boats grew: from seven arrivals in 2008 to 300 by 2013. The AFP had been given laws that made “facilitating the entry of five or more people” into Australia “a very simple, easy-to-prove offence” to be laid against captains and crew of asylum boats. The commonwealth director of public prosecutions was “completely overwhelmed by the caseload” generated by the growing number of boats. “But the most significant flaw is in the design of this legislation,’’ Schloenhardt said. “Australian law has been consistently criticised because it does not reflect international law. To this day, our thresholds for prosecution are much lower, and we capture people that under international law do not commit any offence. “This is a political decision, of course. The people who wrote these laws in the 1990s, who rewrote them in 2010, they knew what they were doing.” Schloenhardt said mandatory minimum sentences were introduced for people-smuggling offences despite widespread criticism. Tony Kevin, a former Australian ambassador who has spent decades researching the issue of asylum seeker boats, said Australian policies had made asylum voyages more dangerous. “Australian policy, by criminalising the Indonesian ferrymen and the sailors who worked for them, has had all sorts of perversely negative consequences. Those policies encouraged people smugglers to seek out old, dilapidated boats of little value – because they knew the boats would be burned – and that made voyages more lethal.” Kevin said severe penalties for adults, but not for children, meant there was an incentive to recruit minors to be crew. “These poor young boys – they didn’t know what was happening, they didn’t carry documents – and great mistakes were made I’m sure, which left them rotting in Australian prisons. “But these children were expendable to the nasty people organising these trips, whom we rarely, if ever, saw before Australian courts.” The AFP said in a statement that it no longer used wrist X-rays for age determination. It said it could not comment on matters before the courts.",News/Australia news,Indonesian children jailed in Australia as adult people smugglers win court battle to clear their names,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/indonesian-children-jailed-in-australia-as-adult-people-smugglers-win-court-battle-to-clear-their-names
