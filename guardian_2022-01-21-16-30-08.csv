1/21/2022,"From its title alone, you may be forgiven for thinking that The King’s Daughter is a film about a king’s daughter. It isn’t. It’s about Pierce Brosnan’s berserk quest to achieve immortality by stabbing a mermaid through the heart. True, there is a king in it; and, yes, he does have a daughter. But I have to make this perfectly clear, it’s actually a film about Pierce Brosnan trying to murder a mermaid through the heart.  Clearly, there have been meetings about this. The King’s Daughter is an adaptation of Vonda McIntyre’s 1997 novel The Moon and the Sun; a novel that, it must be said, won the Nebula book award ahead of A Game of Thrones on publication. But you can’t call a film The Moon and the Sun, because people might inadvertently think they’re going to watch a film about the actual moon and the actual sun. My instinct, given the subject matter, would have instead been to call it Pierce Brosnan Stabbing a Mermaid Through the Heart. This is partly because it is a precise description of what happens in the film, but mainly because who wouldn’t want to watch a film called Pierce Brosnan Stabbing a Mermaid Through the Heart? Only the very worst kind of idiot, that’s who. But no. They went with The King’s Daughter, because one of the characters is the king’s daughter. That’s it. That’s the only reason. It’s like renaming Planet of the Apes as Charlton Heston’s Shipmate, or The Terminator as A Nice Leather Jacket. It’s pointless. I have a theory about films. The blander a movie’s title, the more it has probably been messed around with in production. Tom Cruise once made a film with the (excellent) working title of All You Need is Kill, but upon release its name was changed to Edge of Tomorrow which – just to give you an idea of its impossible blandness – is literally taken from the lyrics of the Saved by the Bell: The College Years theme tune. Remember Snakes on a Plane? That film was nearly released as Pacific Air Flight 121, which is arguably the dullest combination of words and letters in all of history. So, judging by its title, you might think that The King’s Daughter has had a similarly troubled production. And boy, has it ever. The film spent 15 years trying to get off the ground under various studios with various directors. It was finally made in 2014 with director Sean McNamara, but then – just three weeks before its original release date in April 2015 – Paramount pulled the film from its schedules without explanation. In short, this movie has sat on a shelf for the best part of a decade. It isn’t cinema, it’s a historical artefact. You can see how long The King’s Daughter has been sitting in storage just by its cast. Pierce Brosnan has long since adopted the look of a sexy silver Colonel Sanders, but here he’s still in the midst of his brunette pomp. Fan Bingbing, who plays the mermaid, has had her entire career blown up by a tax evasion scandal since shooting wrapped. Kaya Scodelario, who plays the king’s daughter, fell in love with co-star Benjamin Walker on the film’s set. They have since married and had two children together. Now, obviously, the uncertainty surrounding this film must have been galling for all involved. Vonda McIntyre didn’t sign over the rights to her book thinking that it would dissolve into such a mess. The actors didn’t want to make a film that nobody would see. Sean McNamara has remained prolific throughout, directing films such as Aliens Ate My Homework and Baby Geniuses and the Space Baby, but the whole affair must have left a mark on him. The worst thing is that The King’s Daughter isn’t even that bad. Again, I should be clear, it isn’t good. It’s the sort of film where, one hour into a movie that is entitled The King’s Daughter (and 58 minutes after the narrator has introduced the king’s daughter by calling her “the king’s daughter”), the king’s daughter reacts to news that she is the king’s daughter with palpable “who could have possibly seen this coming?” Sixth Sense twist-level shock. But, still, it isn’t that bad. The King’s Daughter is set in Versailles, and it was shot there too, so it intermittently looks very beautiful. Everyone in the cast is impossibly attractive. Brosnan plays Louis XIV as a sort of mid-70s Jagger, which is a lot of fun. This isn’t a film that’s totally without merit. And yet events have conspired against it, and it is destined to be quickly forgotten. But ask yourself this: would that still be the case if they had chosen to call it Pierce Brosnan Stabbing a Mermaid Through the Heart?

1/21/2022,"The amount of money Guatemalans living abroad send home to their families reached record levels in 2021. Remittances rose to more than $15bn (£11bn) in 2021, an increase of 35% on the previous year. The unprecedented rise prompted experts to question the political will to tackle the migration crisis when remittances from the US contribute so much to the Guatemalan economy.  The Biden administration has maintained pressure on the governments of Central America to resolve the causes of migration, launching a plan to invest $4bn over four years in the Central American country, along with neighbouring Honduras and El Salvador. “[The political elite] don’t go for migration, they won’t stop it,” said Paul Briere, a former congressional representative in Guatemala who once headed the country’scongressional commission on migration. “They won’t make the effort to stop migration, they won’t make the effort to combat corruption, they will not make the effort to combat inequality, they will not make the effort to combat poverty, because they need that to be the situation. They need these people to leave Guatemala.” Guatemala continues to have an extremely low minimum wage when compared with the cost of living, forcing many to depend on remittances for survival while elites benefit from low labour costs. “The worst thing is that we are becoming a remittance dependent country,” Briere said. “It is a perverse system. [Migrants] are our largest export item, when it should be, in my opinion, an embarrassment.” “It is an indicator of the grand exodus from the country to the United States that has existed in the last 20 years,” added Pedro Pablo Solares, a lawyer and migration expert. Remittances have especially contributed to maintaining the Guatemalan economy during the Covid pandemic. In December 2021, the Guatemalan Chamber of Industry issued a press statement celebrating the “historic” economic growth of 7.5% in 2021, of which remittances were the largest growing sector. The next largest growth area was exports which increased by 15.4%. Since 2014, the number of Guatemalans seeking to migrate has increased significantly in part due to the structural inequalities and the lack of job opportunities. According to Mario Arturo Garcia, a Guatemalan remittances analyst, in the past few years banks have seen increases of between 200,000 to 250,000 new users each year and between 2 and 2.5 million remittance transactions every month. There are an estimated 2.9 million Guatemalans living in the US, according to the Guatemalan Ministry of Foreign Relations. For Guatemalan families living in poverty the money sent home means they are able to survive and provide housing and education for their children. Brenda Pérez, 25, lives in the village of Llano de Pinal on the outskirts of Guatemala’s second largest city, Quetzaltenango, with her two daughters, aged nine and five. Her husband, Carlos, migrated to the US in 2019 hoping to earn enough money to build his family a home and provide his two daughters with an education. “The money he sends has helped us a lot,” said Pérez. “Here we could not do anything, because of how little we are paid.” Before he left, Pérez’s husband earned 25 quetzales (about £2.40) a day working in agriculture, when there was work to do. Since migrating he has sent about 3,000 quetzales home every month from his job in a restaurant. Pérez has supplemented the money her husband sends with weaving that she sells for between 25 and 60 quetzales. The money sent from the US has also helped the family pay for an internet connection so that the girls can attend school online as well as buy food which has risen in price. “The price of everything has risen a lot,” said Pérez. “Even electricity has become more expensive.” While frustration with the increase in cost of living grows in Guatemala, remittances and migration relieve some of the pressure on the government. They mean that the Guatemalan state does not have to meet the social needs for education, quality infrastructure, or healthcare in the country, all of which receive low state investment. “The issue is that if people don’t have that escape valve, to emigrate, then obviously the internal conflict in Guatemala is on the rise,” Briere said. “Because by not providing even basic services to people, it obviously generates a greater discontent with local authorities and with the central government.” Sign up for the Global Dispatch newsletter – a fortnightly roundup of our top stories, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues:",News/Global development,Guatemala’s economy buoyed by record $15bn sent home from workers overseas,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/21/guatemala-remittances-15bn-buoy-up-economy
1/21/2022,"Nestle has withdrawn a special range of KitKats in India which featured images of sacred Hindu deities on the wrapper, after accusations of hurting religious sentiments. The limited range of the well-known chocolate bar had been launched as part of the global “KitKat travel breaks” range, where photos of artwork by local artisans were printed on the wrappers.  But the Indian version of the range, which was designed to celebrate the crafts of the Indian state of Odisha, provoked an online backlash as they featured images of Hindu deities Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Mata Subhadra. Many expressed outrage that the wrappers might end up in “dustbins, drains, gutters” or trodden underfoot, which would be disrespectful of the gods and the Hindu faith. As Hindu nationalism has been on the rise in India, there has been a heightened sensitivity towards the depiction of the Hindu faith in the public sphere and recent accusations of hurting religious sentiments have been levelled at books, films, TV shows and advertisements. It is a honor to see our Odisha culture & lord jagannath, balabhadra & subhadra on ##KitKat but plz think once, whn some1 will eat 🍫 & will throw the wrapper into dustbins, drains, gutters & many will walk on it 😭.

Nestle said that as “pre-emptive action”, it had now recalled the KitKat range from the market. “We wanted to encourage people to know about the art and its artisans. We do understand the sensitivity of the matter and regret if we have inadvertently hurt people’s sentiments,” the company said in a statement. It is not the first time the KitKat travel range has landed Nestle in hot water.

1/21/2022," A comedy-drama from Christopher Miller (21 Jump Street) that offers a snarky take on the mystery whodunnit. Set in the aftermath of a high-school reunion, there’s been a murder but also a lot of flirting, old rivalries rekindled and amnesia-inducing levels of drunkenness. Starting with gauche, likable Aniq (Sam Richardson), Tiffany Haddish’s detective Danner interviews each partygoer in turn – including Chelsea (Ilana Glazer) and Jamie Demetriou’s Walt. It’s a little too delighted with its own conceit at times, but there’s the making of an involving through-line in Aniq and Zoe (Zoe Chao) and what happens with their romantic chemistry.Apple TV+, from Friday 28 December “I still can’t believe that dragonflies have two penises.” It’s a crazy world out there, and in his podcast of the same title, this Queer Eye star has been exploring it engagingly. Transferring the formula to TV was the natural next step and the result is thoroughly watchable. Ranging from gender identity to snacks, the aesthetics of insects to the practicalities of ice dancing, his curiosities are somewhat random. But he’s funny and easy to warm to, never pretending knowledge he doesn’t have, and asking the right questions. TV as an unusually entertaining Wikipedia binge.Netflix, from Friday 28 December Fans of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK will remember Cherry Valentine, who came out to the world as a Gypsy drag queen in season two last year. Cherry was born and raised as George Ward in the Traveller community in the north-east of England. However, George didn’t feel accepted and moved away, only maintaining contact with his mother. In this documentary, George is returning to his roots to see how easily queer and Gypsy identities can become compatible. Expect some painful home truths and, hopefully, a touch of redemption, too.BBC Three, from Tuesday 25 December An affecting documentary following reporter Ashley John-Baptiste as he gets to know his brother. John-Baptiste grew up in foster care and believed himself to be an only child until he was contacted by his sibling in his mid-20s. The film widens its perspective to show that this isn’t all that uncommon – there’s a shortage of foster carers willing to take more than one child so it isn’t always easy to keep siblings together. Alongside his own, hugely emotional voyage of discovery, John-Baptiste explores the realities of a creaking system.BBC Three, from Wednesday 26 December Another documentary series that treats a successful football team with an almost mystical fervour. It explores the “life, work and miracles” of Atlético Madrid’s manager Diego Simeone and is centred on his team’s La Liga triumph in the 2020-21 season. But there’s plenty of room for reflection on Simeone’s career as a famously robust midfielder, perhaps best remembered in England as the Argentinian provocateur who played a central part in David Beckham’s pivotal World Cup dismissal in 1998. Boo hiss!Amazon Prime Video, from Wednesday 26 December What would you do if you were a heartbroken heavy drinker, who regularly mixed booze with pills, and you witnessed what might have been a murder?

This new series works as both a mystery and an endearingly silly parody of a “woman driven mad by domesticity” pseudo-psychological drama.Netflix, from Friday 28 December The latest TV sensation out of South Korea shares a certain brutality with Squid Game – and a plot that hinges round events so outlandish that no one in authority will believe they are happening. In fairness, if as a police officer you received a phone call from a teenager claiming his school was being overrun by zombies, you might be forgiven a certain scepticism.

1/21/2022,"For a little over a year, America has faced a democratic crisis unlike any it has seen in recent history.  As Republicans have spread lies about the 2020 presidential election, confidence in it remains staggeringly low and about 1 in 3 Americans now believe Joe Biden was not legitimately elected. Republicans who claim the election was stolen are trying to grab key election administration roles, prompting unprecedented alarm that a future election could be overturned. And after an election with record participation, Republicans have pushed a wave of new laws making it harder to vote, placing new restrictions on longstanding policies that went unquestioned for years. “We’re facing the most significant test of our democracy since the civil war,” Biden said in July. On Wednesday night, Democrats’ biggest hope of blunting that threat failed in a historic defeat as Republicans used the filibuster – a technical senate rule that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation – to block a sweeping voting rights bill from passing. For months Democrats had offered the legislation as an antidote to the anti-democratic sickness that is plaguing America. The bill would have been the most dramatic expansion of the right to vote in a generation. It would have outlawed partisan gerrymandering, protected election officials from partisan interference, required early voting and same-day registration, and restore the pre-clearance provision at the heart of the Voting Rights Act. Politically, the loss was extremely bruising for Biden, who has spent an enormous amount of his political capital in recent weeks only to end up on the losing side. And – even worse – though the measure was blocked by 50 Republicans who refused to even negotiate around it, the moment was one of clear weakness for Democrats. The party has control of both chambers in Congress yet appeared helpless as two of its conservative senators joined with Republicans to preserve the filibuster and doom the legislation. But the deeper stakes of the failure go far beyond politics. It was a moment in which an American government system, crippled by deep partisanship and an arcane rule, turned its back on a rising threat of a dangerous anti-democratic tide. It’s a moment that future historians will be mystified by, a group of scholars warned in November. “To lose our democracy but preserve the filibuster in its current form – in which a minority can block popular legislation without even having to hold the floor – would be a short-sighted blunder that future historians will forever puzzle over,” they wrote. What happens next isn’t exactly clear. Biden suggested the 2022 elections could be illegitimate absent congressional action, a claim the White House quickly walked back on Thursday. “He was explaining that the results would be illegitimate if states do what the former president asked them to do after the 2020 election: toss out ballots and overturn results after the fact,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, tweeted. Cliff Albright, a co-founder of the group Black Voters Matter, said the vote Wednesday was “disappointing”, but said that his group would continue to push for significant voting reforms. He noted how successful pressure from his group and others had been in getting Biden and other Democrats to support changing the filibuster and pointed out that historic past campaigns to pass the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act required continued pushing after setbacks. “Those debates and those votes were important, to put them on record. So that’s a victory for movement,” he said. “I don’t think this moment will be forgotten.” Tiffany Muller, the president and executive director of Let America Vote/End Citizens United, similarly pledged her group would “regroup” and “keep going” to push voting reforms. “We’re going to take that fight to the states. And we’re going to continue to elect champions down the ballot who will prioritize our democracy, and we’re gonna make sure that we’ll hold Republicans accountable at the ballot box in 2022,” she said. “There is no doubt about it that last night’s vote makes the best option on the federal level not available to us anymore. But we’re still gonna look at ‘are there ways to get other pieces of legislation passed on the federal level?’” Politically, Democrats have pledged to fight on. Previewing what could be a midterm message to frustrated voters on Thursday, Jaime Harrison, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, said the failure in the Senate was evidence for why there needed to be more Democrats in the US Senate. “We can send more Democrats to the US Senate and give President Biden and Vice-president Harris the votes they need to pass voting rights legislation. We can show those who stand in the way of voting rights that their actions have consequences,” he said in a statement. Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who laid out a plan for a talking filibuster, said in a statement he would continue to push to reform the rule. “We fell short. But this is not the end of the story,” he said. “When I came to the Senate, 48 senators voting to change the filibuster seemed like a distant dream, something that would never happen. We’re not there yet, but we’re closer than we’ve ever been.” With broad voting reform stalled, there appears to be some bipartisan appetite in congress for changing the Electoral Count Act, a confusing 19th century law that sets out the procedures for counting electoral votes. Trump’s legal team planned to use ambiguities in the law to try and overturn the election, and election scholars for years have said that it needs to be fixed. “There’s a good win there,” Manchin said after the vote on Wednesday. “I mean, my goodness, that’s what caused the insurrection.” But Democrats have rejected fixing the law alone as an acceptable solution, saying it’s unacceptable to fix the way votes are counted if the rules of voting are rigged. It would be a bit like deciding to fix an unreliable scoreboard in a game of basketball where the rules are rigged against one team. Muller also said she was skeptical of how sincere Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, was in his wish to change the law. “We are supportive of reforming the act. But that’s not going to be nearly enough to protect voters in all of these states. It does nothing to fight back against these voter suppression laws,” she said. Meanwhile, congressional inaction is also likely to encourage those seeking to undermine democracy to be even more aggressive, Sherrilyn Ifill, the director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, told Congress on Thursday. “In 2021, we saw a repeat of history – a steady drip of old poison in new bottles. Whereas in a bygone era, discriminatory intent in voting restrictions was dressed up in ideals such as securing a more informed and invested electorate, the new justification is fighting imaginary voter fraud, a phantom conjured only to attack,” she said, according to prepared remarks. “With no pushback from Congress, those intent on subverting the next election by continuing to raise doubts about 2020 are becoming more brazen, not less,” she added. Eric Foner, a historian at Columbia who studies the Reconstruction era in US history, said it was difficult to predict how future historians would remember this moment. He said there were parallel moments in history when congressional efforts to protect voting rights were thwarted by the filibuster, such as in 1890 when federal voting protections backed by Henry Cabot Lodge were defeated after a filibuster in the senate. “​​Historically, the filibuster has been used for one reason: that is to prevent legislation supporting the rights of Black people,” he said. “Let’s not try to glorify the filibuster as having any reasonable reason for existence other than allowing a minority to rule over a majority.”",News/US news,"After Democrats’ historic defeat on voting rights, what happens next?",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/20/after-democrats-historic-defeat-on-voting-rights-what-happens-next
1/21/2022,"FBI agents and the House panel investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol have both learned of an alleged plan by allies of retired army Lt Gen Michael Flynn to gather “intelligence” on top Republicans to “move” them to back election audits in key states Trump lost, said ex-whistleblower Everett Stern who talked to the panel and the FBI. Stern, who runs the intelligence firm Tactical Rabbit and is a Republican vying for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, in multiple interviews with the Guardian said two Flynn associates with the rightwing Patriot Caucus group enlisted his help in April in a scheme to seek potentially damaging information on two Republican members of Congress to prod them to back an audit of the 2020 vote that Joe Biden won.  Stern told the Guardian he spent several hours in November telling House panel investigators about the alleged drive by Flynn associates who sought campaign finance and other dirt on Pennsylvania’s senator Pat Toomey and congressman Brian Fitzpatrick to win their support for an audit to bolster Trump’s debunked charges that Biden’s win was fraudulent. A long shot candidate to succeed the retiring Toomey, Stern said he alerted the FBI in June when he learned more details of the bizarre drive by Flynn allies to specifically target the two Republicans, both of whom backed impeaching Trump after the January 6 insurrection. The efforts by Flynn’s Patriot Caucus allies were launched after Trump failed to block Biden from taking office, and are part of a wider drive by Trump loyalists and Flynn to help boost Trump’s political fortunes via more state audits nationwide into false charges that Biden’s win was rigged, and elect like-minded candidates in key states to top electoral offices. Stern provided text messages, emails and other documents revealing he had multiple contacts with one of the Patriot Caucus members, Velma Anne Ruth, and two other influential Flynn allies, Houston real estate mogul Al Hartman and former army green beret Ivan Raiklin, who were pushing audits in several key states. Stern said Flynn’s Patriot Caucus associates first approached him in Pennsylvania for possible help after an April Republican party event, and soon after told Stern in phone calls they worked with Flynn and the Patriot Caucus, and planned to recruit “former domestic and foreign intelligence officials” to facilitate their scheme. The plan by Flynn’s allies alarmed Stern, but as a former whistleblower involved in exposing a large bank money laundering scandal by HSBC in 2012, he told the Guardian he decided to play along for a few months to glean information to expose the Trump allies’ scheme. Stern expressed dismay that Flynn’s Patriot Caucus associates “don’t understand that Biden is the president. They wanted to collect information through Tactical Rabbit and my campaign,” to turn up the heat on Toomey and Fitzpatrick to back an audit which Stern viewed as potentially “extortion”. Stern gave the Guardian a voice mail he received in which Hartman talked about leaning on moderate Republican “RINOs” in Pennsylvania to gain support for an audit of that state’s vote which Biden won by over 80,000, and Hartman said a similar drive in Michigan was needed. Stern said Hartman wanted to use Tactical Rabbit’s intelligence gathering tools and his campaign to dig up potentially embarrassing campaign finance information and other dirt about the Pennsylvania members, plus Republican political figures in Michigan who were also resisting audits. Hartman and Raiklin also talked with Stern about meeting Flynn, Trump’s disgraced ex-national security adviser, and proposed compensating him for his information via campaign donations, said Stern. In an April exchange of Hartman text messages seen by the Guardian, Hartman asked a Flynn scheduler to help “connect” Flynn with Stern whose Senate campaign and credentials he touted highly, calling Stern a “strong believer”, in their cause. Although Stern tipped off the FBI in June about what he deemed a threat to national security and he said he met with agents again in November, it’s not clear if his allegations are still being pursued. Stern’s allegations have echoes of Flynn’s scheming with Trump and other loyalists in late 2020 to thwart Biden’s win, efforts that included a White House meeting with Trump where Flynn proposed declaring martial law in several states Biden won and then rerunning the election there. In November, the House panel probing the January 6 Capitol attack subpoenaed Flynn who Trump had pardoned post election even though he had pled guilty twice to lying to the FBI during the Russia investigation. In response to the subpoena to testify and turn over documents, Flynn sued the panel but a judge quickly dismissed his lawsuit last month. John Sipher, who was in the CIA’s clandestine services for 28 years, shares Stern’s view of Flynn who he knew in the military and shortly thereafter. “I am appalled by what he has become,” Sipher said in an email. Asked if he thought the FBI was pursuing Stern’s charges, Sipher said: “I would hope and assume they are taking this seriously.” While Fitzpatrick and Toomey were the main “targets” Stern said other Pennsylvania officials including judges were also being targeted by the Flynn allies as they sought to ramp up pressure for an audit in the state. Neither Fitzpatrick or Toomey’s offices replied to multiple requests for comment. The Patriot Caucus, a coalition of Patriot and other rightwing groups in some two dozen states with which Raiklin and Hartman have ties, according to Stern and documents, has worked with Trump loyalists like Flynn to push audits in key states Biden won, and backed Trump allies for governor, and other top posts in states like Pennsylvania and Arizona Trump lost. Flynn himself on 7 January publicly endorsed another Trump ally and election audit promoter, Doug Mastriano for governor in Pennsylvania, at a campaign rally also attended by Raiklin. Flynn has also endorsed two Trump backed candidates in Arizona: Kari Lake, an ex-Fox News figure for governor, and Mark Finchem, a state representative who attended the January 6 Stop the Steal rally, for secretary of state. To coordinate national efforts, Raiklin and Hartman on 3 July spearheaded one of a series of “Election Integrity” calls with Trump loyalists, lawyers and donors to discuss the status of audits efforts in several states and other plans to cast doubt on Biden’s win, according to an Arizona senate document shared by the watchdog group American Oversight. “Join us every second Saturday for SITUATION UPDATES and COLLABORATION from active leaders in the election remediation process at state level – attorneys with Mike Lindell and Patrick Byrne, data analysts, state legislators, gubernatorial candidates, and grassroots activists whose goal is completing a cyber forensic audit in their state,” the Arizona document reads. A who’s who list of Trump loyalists and groups invited to join these calls included the America Project and America’s Future, both of which Flynn played key roles with as they poured some $2m into a discredited audit of Arizona’s largest county, plus the Patriot Caucus’ Velma Anne Ruth, Finchem and Byrne, the millionaire chief financier of the Arizona audit. Hartman in emails with Stern obtained by the Guardian invited him in June to attend a religious far right meeting known as Ziklag in Dallas where he could meet separately with Flynn. Stern said Hartman told him a “private meeting was going to be arranged with Flynn” who Stern was told wanted to meet him. After indicating to Hartman he would attend, Stern opted to cancel at the last minute after his lawyer indicated there could be legal repercussions from a meeting with Flynn. “I thought it was extremely dangerous to meet with a three star general who I believed had broken the law.” “They planned to give my campaign funds to help me” develop damaging information on Toomey and Fitzpatrick, Stern claimed. “It was like a wink, wink. Hartman is the man behind the curtain. He’s an operative and financier,” promoting audits. Hartman has long been a donor to the right. He’s on the advisory council for the pro Trump Turning Point USA and has been active in the conservative donor network led by oil billionaire Charles Koch. Raiklin, an army reserve officer who reportedly has known Flynn since 2014, is facing an internal army reserve probe into possible violations of rules barring partisan political activity, according to a military official who spoke to Reuters last month. Raiklin in December 2020 outlined a wild scheme in tweets and a podcast to thwart Biden’s win, charging a vast conspiracy that included Pence, intelligence, China and Big Tech, as Reuters reported. Raiklin told Trump to “activate the emergency broadcast system,” and deployed the hashtag #FightLikeAFlynn, stressing that “we the people are going to force this plan on them”. Neither Hartman or Raiklin replied to multiple calls seeking comment. A Flynn scheduler did not respond to questions for the story. Velma Anne Ruth with the Patriot Caucus, who was photographed with Stern at a June event in Pennsylvania where she wore a tank top that said General Flynn, called Stern’s charges “delusional, fabricated and defamatory”, in a text message. Stern said he shared the photo and other documents involving exchanges he had with Ruth with the FBI. Senior ex-prosecutors and intelligence officials say Stern’s allegations merit law enforcement attention. “Stern’s allegations suggest serious crimes,” said ex-prosecutor Paul Rosenzweig who worked on Ken Starr’s team during the impeachment of Bill Clinton. “If his allegations were corroborated by extrinsic evidence they clearly would warrant investigation.” Former CIA official Sipher, who has spoken with Stern before, said: “Everett is someone with a strong sense of right and wrong, and willing to suffer the consequences of doing the right thing. We would be better served to have more people like Everett in public life.”",News/US news,Michael Flynn allies allegedly plotted to lean on Republicans to back vote audits,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/21/michael-flynn-allies-allegedly-targeted-republicans-back-election-audits
1/21/2022,"All plan B measures in England will be lifted next week, meaning an end to compulsory mask-wearing in shops, vaccine certificates for entering venues, and guidance to work from home. But are the public ready to embrace these freedoms just weeks after Covid cases in the UK hit a record high and with daily deaths higher now than when the measures were introduced? Some are likely to feel more than ready to cast aside restrictions that have been financially and personally cumbersome, while others may fear things are moving too quickly. Regardless of the range of attitudes, changing the rules will shift behaviour.  “The research so far has shown that it has been rules that have been the dominant feature in driving behaviour,” said Prof Robert West, a behavioural scientist at University College London (UCL). “When you take the rules away, it won’t happen immediately, but what we’ve seen previously is a gradual erosion of protective behaviours even when attitudes are not changing that much.” West points to a steady decline in the number of people adhering to advice to wear masks once it is not longer a requirement. “People still said they thought it was a good idea, but fewer and fewer people were actually doing it.” West said that indications that the government would allow the legal requirement to self-isolate to lapse did not necessarily mean that people would jump the gun and change their behaviour in advance of this rule change. “From data earlier in the pandemic we did not see substantial rule-breaking ahead of relaxations but in any event the adherence to self-isolation requirements has been low – one of the reasons why we have done so badly in the UK,” he said. “Thinking about other relaxations of legal restrictions, such as changes to cannabis laws in the US, I am not aware of major changes to behaviour ahead of the change.” Once a certain threshold is crossed, the social norm can shift, hastening an overall change in behaviour. However, society does not move as a cohesive group, reflecting the very wide differences in risk faced by different groups and also shaped by personal experiences during the pandemic. “You’ve got many groups of people, including about a quarter who are clinically vulnerable because of their age and/or health status,” said Prof Susan Michie, the director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at UCL. “Many have stopped going out to restaurants and bars and are living very restricted lives. That’s not to do with the rules, it’s to do with the level of infection that has been allowed to surge and stay high over many months.” By contrast, Michie said, young men have been the least likely to adhere to rules and are the group most likely to shift to less cautious behaviour once rules are lifted. People also respond to messaging as well as the letter of the law. Simon Williams, a senior lecturer in people and organisation at Swansea University, said that on this front people may have been left feeling uncertain about what behaviours were now recommended. “As the government mentions, caution is still important, since, despite the positive trend, rates are still high,” he said. “However … the problem with the general advice to ‘be cautious’ is that it is too vague and conflicts with the message that is sent by the removal of all policy measures and protections. “Throughout the pandemic there has been a feeling amongst many that there have been ‘mixed messages’ – often a result of policies and messages not matching up.” Prof Stephen Reicher, a behavioural scientist at the University of St Andrews, noted that behaviour depends not just on people’s eagerness to be out and about, but also on the extent to which choices are available. If working from home is no longer government guidance, it may no longer be an option for many employees, for instance. And when the requirement to self-isolate ends in March (or before then), along with test-and-trace support grants, some of those on low incomes who relied on these payments may not feel they have a choice. “We concentrate a lot on the issue of motivation – will the public want to or not want to go out,” said Reicher. “But actually, when you say ‘it’s up to you’, it means it’s up to you if you’ve got the resources to do it; if not, bad luck.”",News/World news,Mixed messages?

1/21/2022,"Among memories of bake sales, lunchtime walks in salubrious surroundings and debating with colleagues the optimum technique for making a cup of tea, my fondest memory of the office shall always be striking up a friendship – and subsequent relationship – with someone very special. Over a period of days, weeks and months, we bonded over shared interests and enjoyed the buzz of an office romance while being careful to maintain discretion. I sincerely hope that office romances will not become a thing of the past. We are getting married in spring.Stuart, West Midlands  Years ago, I worked for the London Evening News as an advert taker. One guy started by telling me about an amazing product that was guaranteed to help stiff joints, sore necks etc. I thought it sounded brilliant, as my mother had terrible neck problems. I asked if he would like to place a boxed advert to make it stand out and he seemed excited by this. Later that day, the sales manager flew out of his office and screamed for the person responsible for the advert. I was so pleased to tell him it was me and it was for stiff necks, but he turned scarlet and asked a colleague to take me to the ladies’ and have a word. She explained that the product was actually a vibrator, but I was young and didn’t know what that was. Nobody wanted to explain it to me and it took me years to find out – I was very embarrassed when I did!Creanna Cullen, retired, Derbyshire In my early 20s, I worked at a bank. I came back from lunch one day and my team members started asking if I could pop out again to get some sweets; they were feeling a bit low and chocolate or cakes would really cheer them up. I relented and took my suit jacket off my chair, put it on and promptly got stuck. At first, I was confused – I thought I must have put my arms through the lining – but when I saw all of my team laughing their heads off, it dawned on me that they had sewn up the end of both arms of my jacket. That aside, my colleagues really looked after me, always covering for me when I was feeling rough from the night before, making me home-cooked food and giving me advice on dating. I loved those days and that team.Mark Hawkins, implementation manager, Bedfordshire My favourite office memory comes from my time in Montreal. My marriage had just broken down and I was in visa hell. I don’t think I would have survived the year had it not been for my colleagues and my boss, who became like family to me during this difficult time away from my home country. I still consider several people from that office my closest friends and we remain in daily contact. We worked hard and laughed like drains. There was a true spirit of camaraderie in everything we did, whether it was laughing about an embarrassing incident or blasting Enrique Iglesias when someone’s work passed a quality check – every day was so much fun.Elizabeth Gibson, contracts specialist, Manchester My colleague became convinced that there was a pigeon stuck inside a wall in our office. It was a listed building and we would always talk about how loud the pigeon’s “cooing” was. One day, she came into work early and, with the office being so quiet, she found the “cooing” extremely loud, so she contacted maintenance to investigate. They had a look and then called her into a corridor to show her the pigeon, sitting on a window ledge on the other side of the wall. The window was frosted and a blind had been pulled down, so she hadn’t realised that it was an external wall. We heard the maintenance person radio to say: “Yeah, well, it’s outside. I can’t do anything about it being outside.” It was hilarious – and we have never let her live it down.Charlotte, social worker, Lancashire One day, when I was working in the students’ office of a university, I was wearing a lovely green, sparkly scarf. A young chap came to the counter. As I spoke to him, I became aware that I was being pulled downwards. The man looked concerned as an unseen force began dragging me under the high counter. I looked around to see one of my colleagues doubled over laughing. As I was almost on my knees, they pointed at the industrial-sized document shredder under the counter. The fringes of my lovely scarf had gone into its rollers, which triggered the sensors to go full Jaws on me. “Do excuse me,” I said to the student, who was by now goggle-eyed, watching this middle-aged woman limbo under the counter. Fortunately, I was able to whip off the scarf and order was restored.Esther Doyle, retired, London",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘We get married in spring!’ Readers’ favourite memories of office life,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/21/we-get-married-in-spring-readers-favourite-memories-of-office-life
1/21/2022,"Bose is back with a revamp of its most popular noise-cancelling headphones, which improve the technology but keep the good bits mostly the same. The company appears to have taken an “ain’t broke, don’t fix it” approach to the new headphones, which are similar to the excellent QuietComfort 35 from 2016 but markedly different to the more modern NCH 700 that launched two years ago.  The QuietComfort 45 cost £320 ($330/A$500) and are non-showy and comfortable. The design has been refined with smoother ear cushions and fewer lines and microphone holes in the ear cups for a more minimalist look, but side by side the differences with the QuietComfort 35s are subtle. The headband is now lined with smoother vegan leather rather than the suede-like Alcantara of their predecessors. The headphones are still light, well balanced and stay put on your head without needing to clamp particularly hard, aiding their long-term comfort. The construction feels robust and capable of taking a beating, similar to their longstanding predecessors that stood up very well to years of the rough and tumble of travel and my daily commute. The QC45 are a standard set of Bluetooth 5.1 headphones supporting the universal SBC and AAC audio formats, which are compatible with most phones, tablets, computers and other devices. They can connect to two devices at once, such as a phone for calls and tablet for video, and had a rock solid connection to iPhones and Android devices. You can use a cable for wired listening even when the headphones are out of battery. A sliding switch turns the headphones on and off and puts them into pairing mode, while a trio of buttons control playback and volume. A button on the left cup switches between sound modes. Unlike most high-end rivals, the QC45 do not pause the music when you take them off, however. Weight: 240g Dimensions: 184 x 152.4 x 76.2mm Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.1 with multipoint, 3.5mm, USB-C charging Bluetooth codecs: SBC, AAC Battery life: 24 hours All Bose headphones have a signature sound that has proven divisive in audiophile circles, typically because they heavily process sound, which means music is considered to be removed from what the artist intended. The QC45 sound generally pleasant and better balanced than rivals, producing a solid punch in the low end without it overriding other tones. Vocals are particularly clear, but the treble and highs can be over accentuated, making some punk tracks with heavy use of cymbals a little overbearing. Separation between instruments and tones is excellent, even for very complex and overlapping tracks. Despite lacking any virtual surround-sound feature, the QC45 do an excellent job of recreating the big booms, action and vocals of movies. The active noise cancelling removes more unwanted sound than almost any other set of headphones, reducing higher tones and speech more reliably and to a greater extent than most rivals. Unlike the NCH 700, the QC45 only have two sound modes: “quiet”, with noise canceling on, and “aware”, with noise cancelling turned off and the sound of the outside world piped in – useful for listing out for traffic or announcements. You cannot use them without one or other sound mode turned on. Call quality is reasonable, with my voice coming through clear if a little distant-sounding, but they let some background noise through and fall far short of the performance of the NCH 700. The QC45 last for about 25 hours of listening over Bluetooth between charges or significantly longer via cable. That’s plenty for most commutes and the longest of flights, but five hours short of their best competitors from Sony. They fully charge via USB-C in 2.5 hours, with a 15-minute charge adding up to three hours of playback. Bose estimates that the battery will last in excess of 500 full charge cycles but it is not replaceable, ultimately making the headphones disposable. The headphones are generally repairable, and some replacement parts including the ear cushions, at £24.95 for a pair, are available. The headphones do not contain recycled materials. Bose does not publish individual product environmental impact reports but does publish annual sustainability reports. The Bose QuietComfort 45 cost £319.95 ($329/A$499.95). For comparison, the RRP of the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 is £349.95, the QuietComfort 35 II cost £299.95, the QuietComfort Earbuds cost £249.95, the Sony WH-1000XM4 cost £279, B&W PX7 cost £349.99, Apple AirPods Max cost £549. The Bose QuietComfort 45 offer some of the very best noise cancelling and comfort money can buy. If you need a set of headphones to wear for hours on end, such as on long-haul flights or endless commutes, there aren’t many better options. They’re light, fold up for travel, feel robust, sound good, connect to two devices at once, can be used with a cable and last for about 25 hours between charges. But while that formula made their predecessors top dog in 2016, the QC45 lack the bells and whistles offered by the latest rivals at similar or lower prices, such as automatic pause, virtual surround sound, sound and noise cancelling customisation and support for higher quality audio formats. The Bose are still great but a bit pricy at RRP. They are frequently discounted so look for a deal or consider the still excellent QC 35 II, which are available for about £200. Note the battery cannot be replaced on the new headphones by Bose, ultimately making them disposable and losing a star. Pros: best-in-class noise cancelling, super comfortable, 25-hour battery life, good sound, Bluetooth can connect to two devices at once, fold up for travel, cross-platform companion app, can be used with a cable. Cons: expensive, voice mic lets in background noise, no higher-quality audio format support, no equaliser, no variable noise cancelling levels.

1/21/2022,"Tonga has turned back an aid flight from Australia due to a positive Covid case on board, despite assurances from the Morrison government that humanitarian relief from the volcanic eruption and tsunami could be offered in a Covid-safe way. Tonga is Covid-free and has a strict border control policy, requiring contactless delivery of aid that began arriving by plane on Thursday.  The Australian aid flight left Brisbane on Thursday afternoon but was turned around mid-flight after being notified of the positive Covid case, an Australian defence spokeswoman said. All crew had returned negative rapid antigen tests before departure, but PCR tests later showed the positive result. The supplies were moved to another flight that took off on Friday. The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano eruption last Saturday triggered a tsunami that destroyed villages, resorts and many buildings, and knocked out communications for the nation of about 105,000 people. Three people had been reported killed, authorities said. On Monday the Australian minister for international development and the Pacific, Zed Seselja, told the ABC that Australia had developed protocols “for how humanitarian supplies can be delivered in a Covid-safe way” by minimising person-to-person contact. Seselja committed to “comply with whatever requirements the Tongan government has for anyone entering the country”. “We absolutely respect the need and the desire for the Tongan people to make sure that they don’t have Covid come into the country, even if it’s through humanitarian flights,” he said. Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, spoke to his Tongan counterpart, Siaosi Sovaleni, on Wednesday, reassuring him that Australia was “placing the highest priority on delivering support in a Covid-safe way”. Almost a week since the eruption, Tongans are struggling to find clean drinking water with their island homes shrouded in volcanic ash. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We are cleaning the ash and have been since Monday,” Branko Sugar, a 61-year-old who runs a bottle shop and fishing charter business from the capital Nuku’alofa, said. “Everything is so dusty, and we are running out of water,” he said over a patchy telephone line. “We only have the tap water, and it’s been contaminated. We’re just cleaning, cleaning, cleaning and can hardly breathe for all the dust.” The first aid flights from Australia and New Zealand landed in Tonga on Thursday with much-needed supplies of water for sanitation and hygiene as well as shelter, communication equipment and power generators.

Australia’s HMAS Adelaide en route from Brisbane is due in Tonga next week. United Nations spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said in a briefing that Tonga had asked for urgent assistance and the agency is in close contact with the authorities. “Assessment teams have reached most parts of the country, including remote and isolated islands,” Dujarric said. “We remain seriously concerned about access to safe water for 50,000 people throughout the country. Water quality testing continues, and most people are relying on bottled water,” he said. Some 60,000 people have been affected by damage to crops, livestock, and fisheries due to ashfall, saltwater intrusion and the potential for acid rain, Dujarric said. There are also reports of fuel shortages, he added. Australia’s foreign minister Marise Payne said on Friday cash donations to Tonga for immediate humanitarian supplies – Australia has donated $1m – would need to be followed with more substantial support for rebuilding. “The impact of this volcanic eruption and the subsequent tsunami and the damage the inundation is causing will be an ongoing challenge for Tonga, particularly in relation to infrastructure,” she said. Telephone links between Tonga and the outside world were reconnected late on Wednesday, although restoring full internet services is likely to take a month or more. Tongans have turned to social media to post images of the destruction by the tsunami and give accounts of their shock after the massive explosion. Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center has said the force of the eruption was estimated to be the equivalent of five to 10 megatons of TNT, or more than 500 times that of the nuclear bomb the United States dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima at the end of World War Two.",News/World news,Tonga turns back aid flight from Australia after positive Covid case discovered,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/tonga-turns-back-aid-flight-from-australia-after-positive-covid-case-discovered
