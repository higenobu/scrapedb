1/25/2022,"President Biden was caught on a hot mic Monday appearing to call Fox News reporter Peter Doocy a ""stupid son of a bitch"" in response to a question asked at the start of a White House event on lowering the prices of consumer goods.  As the meeting at the White House wrapped up, a reporter asked the president for an update on a call held earlier in the day on the situation in Ukraine. Biden seemed impatient that the question had veered off the topic of the meeting.  “The only reason I don’t like doing this is that you never report on why I called a meeting, and this is really important. I had a very, very, very good meeting — total unanimity with all the European leaders. We’ll talk about it later,” Biden told the reporter. “Thank you.” Another reporter then proceeded to shout out a question about a Pentagon plan to possibly send up to 8,500 U.S. troops to Eastern Europe in anticipation of a Russian incursion in Ukraine. Biden ignored that question, and the reporters were in the process of being escorted from the room when Doocy yelled out, “Do you think inflation is a political liability in the midterms?” “That’s a great asset — more inflation,” Biden responded in a low voice that was heard on his live microphone. “What a stupid son of a bitch.”  It’s the second time in a week that Biden was heard criticizing a question posed to him by a Fox News reporter. At the conclusion of a White House press conference on Thursday, Fox News correspondent Jacqui Heinrich fired off a question about Biden’s response to the threat posed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in Ukraine.  “Why are you waiting on Putin to make the first move, sir?” Heinrich asked.  “What a stupid question,” Biden said as the reporters were led from the room. ",Politics/Yahoo News,"On hot mic, Biden appears to call Fox News reporter 'stupid son of a b****'",https://news.yahoo.com/on-hot-mic-biden-appears-to-call-fox-news-reporter-stupid-son-of-a-b-225939659.html
1/25/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — The man who shot two New York City police officers in a Harlem apartment, killing one of them and putting another in critical condition, died Monday of injuries sustained when a third officer shot him, Mayor Eric Adams said at a news conference on his plans to combat gun violence. Lashawn J. McNeil, 47, had swung open a bedroom door and opened fire at the officers Friday as they responded to a 911 call for a domestic dispute, authorities said. Officer Sumit Sulan, a rookie who was shadowing the two wounded officers, shot McNeil as he tried to flee, striking him in the head and arm, police said. A law enforcement official told The Associated Press that McNeil died Monday afternoon at Harlem Hospital, where he'd been in critical condition since the shooting. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and did so on condition of anonymity. McNeil's mother told the New York Post she was trying to convince her son to get help for mental health issues and that she wouldn't have called 911 had she known he was going to use violence against the officers. “If I knew, I never would have made the phone call,” Shirley Sourzes said in an article published Monday on the Post's website. “I would never have called!” Three officers arrived at the apartment after a call came in from a woman needing help with McNeil, who was her son, officials said. They spoke with the woman and another son, but there was no mention of a weapon. Then two of the officers walked from the front of the apartment down a narrow hall, authorities said. McNeil then opened the door and fired on the officers. The gun he used was a .45-caliber Glock stolen from Baltimore in 2017, equipped with a high-capacity magazine capable of holding up to 40 extra rounds, NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said. Police said Monday that while searching the apartment over the weekend they found a loaded semi-automatic rifle under McNeil’s mattress. Officer Jason Rivera, 22, was killed and Officer Wilbert Mora, 27, was gravely injured. Mora was transferred Sunday from Harlem Hospital to NYU Langone Medical Center. Rivera, 22, entered the police academy in November 2020 and had been assigned to the 32nd precinct in Harlem since graduating last May. He’d made 15 arrests in his short career, according to police records. In an essay at the police academy, he wrote that he became an officer to “better the relationship between the community and the police,” acknowledging unpleasant experiences with police while growing up in the Inwood section of Manhattan. Mora, 27, entered the academy in October 2018 and had been assigned to the Harlem precinct since November 2019. He’s racked up 33 arrests, police records show. McNeil was on probation for a 2003 drug conviction in New York City and also had several out of state arrests. In 1998, he was arrested in South Carolina for unlawfully carrying a pistol, but records show the matter was later dismissed. In 2002, he was arrested in Pennsylvania for assaulting a police officer, Essig said. __ Follow Michael Sisak on Twitter at twitter.com/mikesisak",U.S./Associated Press,"Man who shot 2 NYPD officers, killing 1, has died",https://news.yahoo.com/official-man-suspected-killing-nypd-210258367.html

""I peeked outside the door, and that's whenever I noticed the animal on my left-hand side, and it was so scared and so cold and shivering,"" Eyth said.

1/25/2022,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Police said on Tuesday they were investigating the death of a man who was reportedly killed when an explosive vest he was wearing detonated while he was driving his car in a suburban street in the Australian city of Melbourne. The vest was understood to have been triggered by the car hitting a speed bump on Young Road in the suburb of Hallam on Saturday morning, Seven News reported. Security camera video showed the flash of the explosion rise about the car's roof and from the driver’s side window. A speed bump wasn't apparent in the video. The car continued to travel a few hundred meters before it hit a parked vehicle near the corner of Young Road and Homewood Boulevard. Emergency services were called to reports of a minor vehicle collision at the intersection at 11:40 a.m. local time, a police statement said. A 43-year-old man from the suburb of Dandenong was found dead inside his car, which also contained “explosive items,” police said. Police have not released his name. “Bomb Response Unit members attended due to explosive items located inside the vehicle and it took a considerable amount of time for the Bomb Response Unit to render these items safe,” police said. “The circumstances surrounding his death are under investigation by the Arson and Explosives Squad and it is not being treated as suspicious,” police said. The term “not suspicious” means police do not consider the man was a victim of a crime. Police did not say where the man was heading. He had visited the home of his ex-partner immediately before his death, Seven reported. Witness Ben Augel estimated 15 police cars responded, closing streets as bomb and arson experts worked. Neighbors said police spent almost 24 hours at the scene, Seven reported. “I just heard a big, loud bang at 11 a.m. and looked out the window of my house and saw a car had gone through the roundabout and hadn’t braked or anything like that and crashed,” Augel told Seven. Seven described the driver as a former soldier and a father. A spray painted tribute on a brick wall near the scene of the tragedy said: ”Dad my soldier 4 ever” with a love heart.",U.S./Associated Press,Australian reportedly killed when explosive vest detonates,https://news.yahoo.com/australian-reportedly-killed-explosive-vest-222740661.html
1/25/2022,"By Tiemoko Diallo BAMAKO (Reuters) -Mali's government said on Monday it had asked Denmark to immediately withdraw troops deployed to the West African nation as part of a French-led counter-terrorism task force because it was not consulted and the deployment failed to follow protocol. ""The government of Mali notes with astonishment, the deployment on its territory of a contingent of Danish special forces within the Takuba force,"" the government said in a statement. It said the deployment took place without its consent, and without consideration of the additional protocol applicable to the task force, adding that Denmark should immediately withdraw the troops. The statement said all partners in the task force needed a prior accord with the government before deployments in Mali. The decision comes amid tension between Mali and its international partners including regional bodies and the European Union that have sanctioned Mali https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-will-fall-line-with-ecowas-sanctions-mali-borrell-says-2022-01-13 after the transitional government failed to organise elections following two military coups. Tensions have escalated also over allegations that transitional authorities have deployed private military contractors from the Russia-backed Wagner Group to Mali, which some EU countries have said was incompatible with their mission. A statement on the Danish defence ministry website said on Monday that about 90 personnel including surgeons and the Danish army special forces, logistics support were deployed. Their mandate was supposed to last until early 2023, it said. The Takuba Task Force was established as a partial successor to a French counter-terrorism operation in the West African Sahel region that French President Emmanuel Macron has started to reduce from its initial 5,000-strong force. The task force is comprised of some 14 European countries, which provide special forces, logistical and tactical support to work alongside regional troops for targeted operations against Islamist militants. The forces are expected to help Mali and West Africa Sahel neighbours Burkina Faso and Niger tackle jihadist militants linked to the Islamic State and al Qaeda who have occupied swathes of territory in the tri-border area of the countries. ""The aim is to stabilize Mali and parts of the Liptako-Gourma three-country area encompassing localities in Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, and to ensure the protection of civilians against terrorist groups,"" the Danish statement said.
