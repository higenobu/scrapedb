5/6/2022,"Scott Morrison has insinuated Anthony Albanese is using his Covid infection as an excuse, suggesting he “can’t hack the campaign”. Morrison used a campaign event in Western Australia on Friday to personally target the Labor leader, brushing off suggestions his opponent’s performance could be impaired by his recent bout of Covid-19. Asked if Albanese’s performance on the campaign could be excused by “brain fog”, a symptom of cognitive impairment attributed to Covid, Morrison told the West Australian’s Leadership Matters event that “if that’s what he wants to believe, if that helps him get through the day, well good luck to him”. “But when you’re prime minister, you don’t get to do that … being in a campaign is nothing compared to running a government,” he said. “And if you can’t hack the campaign, then I think people are starting to think, is this guy really up to it?” The comment follows a similar jibe last week, in which Morrison accused Albanese of having a “quiet week” while he was in Covid isolation as opposed to his “busy” schedule when the prime minister was infected earlier in the year. The Coalition trails in the polls ahead of the 21 May election and is facing a growing insurgency in normally blue-ribbon inner-city electorates from teal independents, who received a boost from former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull on Friday. Morrison has urged voters to retain the Coalition because they do not know and cannot trust the Labor alternative. Before he contracted Covid, Albanese started the campaign with a gaffe: failing to recall the unemployment rate and official interest rate. But since the initial stumble, Albanese has sharpened his performance, including winning the first leaders’ debate, according to the audience of undecided voters. On Thursday Albanese appeared to need a briefing note from an adviser to answer a question asking for the details of Labor’s six-point plan to improve the National Disability Insurance Scheme. In a solo appearance earlier on Friday, Albanese said improving the NDIS was “not about gotcha questions” and rejected suggestions his campaign had been slow in comparison to Morrison’s since he emerged from isolation. Albanese told reporters that Covid “has an impact” but responded to a question about “needing to nap in the afternoon” by reciting a lengthy list of campaign appearances. Albanese noted on Thursday he appeared on breakfast television, did a radio interview, attended the smart energy expo, did a press conference, held meetings at the commonwealth parliamentary offices, spoke at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, went into his electorate office in Marrickville and appeared on the ABC’s Q&A program. “I think that’s a pretty heavy program.” Later on Friday Morrison told the event that the election was a choice between a “strong economy or a weaker economy”. “I want Australia to be strong and secure in a difficult, turbulent world - and strength matters more than ever,” he said. “I don’t subscribe to the ‘small target’ philosophy of leadership that others seem to have done. You can’t as prime minister. The job is too big to be small. “Small target means a small leader. A small leader is a weak leader. And a weak leader is a risk to Australia, our economy and our security.”",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison suggests Anthony Albanese is using Covid as an excuse in response to ‘brain fog’ question,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/scott-morrison-suggests-anthony-albanese-is-using-covid-as-an-excuse-in-response-to-brain-fog-question
5/6/2022,"Icannot think of a more stressful viewing experience than Tehran (Apple TV+), a thriller so hectic it makes Homeland look like one of those ambient noise apps that send you off to sleep. The first season saw Tamar (Niv Sultan), an Israeli Mossad hacker/agent with an Iranian family background, going undercover in Tehran in order to facilitate airstrikes on a nuclear power plant. There was a lot of double-crossing, a lot of shooting, and an awful lot of stress. It ended in fairly disastrous fashion, leaving plenty of options open for what could happen next. All-out war? More subterfuge? Either way, it was unlikely to be relaxing. We join Tamar and her Iranian collaborator Milad (Shervin Alenabi) hiding out in Tehran, two months after the first season’s finale and after all the betrayals it unleashed upon the key players on each side. The old mission is in limbo and must be wrapped up, and Tamar, who has been left adrift, must figure out how to extract herself. But this is not a repeat of season one, and a new mission is to be established. I briefly hoped that, for those of us of a nervous disposition, the new mission might involve manoeuvring Mossad and the Revolutionary Guard towards a cup of tea and a nice lie down. Instead, it involves prisons, hospitals, break-ins and break-outs, secret services, people-smuggling, newly appointed government officials, family members in various states of compromise and, in what looks like a display of Apple TV+’s confidence in the international appeal of the series, a brand new star in the form of Glenn Close. Appearing as British woman Marjan Montazeri towards the end of the first episode, and speaking a mixture of Farsi and English, Close exudes power and malevolence. As she stepped out of the shadows, she reminded me a little of Ozark’s Cartel lawyer Helen Pierce, crossed with the wicked stepmother in a fairytale. She is authoritative and suspicious, and, as this is Tehran, it is impossible to know whether she should be trusted or not. Unfortunately, Tamar, trapped in Iran, still hunted by Faraz and still of enormous use to the Mossad, does not appear to have much choice in the matter. All the standard hacker/thriller tropes are present, and used with effect. No episode is boring – everything is taken right up to the wire. There are uploads and downloads, unravelling at an excruciating pace, and chugging towards 100% on the progress bar, as impending danger threatens to kick down the door. There are long chase scenes every five minutes or so. There is a lot of running around in marketplaces and hiding in dark corners, as atmospheric music pounds ominously. And it seems more grim this time around. The bodycount was never particularly restrained, but there are multiple hangings, shootings, and ridiculously large machine guns. But, in among the relentless action, we occasionally see beyond the espionage into a certain side of life in Tehran. There are drug deals at the gym. The wealthy son of a familiar and crucial commander drives expensive sports cars around the city and is soon to be entangled in business that is highly beneficial to the Mossad’s interests. The aftershocks of the first season continue to have an effect on Tamar, and it feels important to see that she has been traumatised by the horrors she has both witnessed and played a key role in facilitating. Will she be able to maintain the cool, rational judgment she needs to continue to play the long game? Tehran is one of a raft of better dramas that suggest Apple is getting its act together as a streaming service worth paying attention to, after a long period of treading water. Its policy of releasing a couple of episodes then drip-feeding the rest week-by-week works particularly well for thrillers and stories that thrive on twists and turns; I am now waiting for whatever insanity Shining Girls is ready to unleash upon us every Friday. Tehran is a perfect fit for this approach. Two episodes at once is plenty. Bingeing a whole series in one go would be masochistic. Whether the prospect of watching a drama about the distinct possibility of a catastrophic war fought in the shadows and involving nuclear capabilities will float your boat may be up for debate, but perhaps it will be like the early days of the pandemic, when everyone decided that the film they would most like to watch was Contagion. I still have a sneaking suspicion that Tehran thinks of itself as slightly more highbrow than it is, but it is a solid thriller, often breathlessly exciting, and has cracked the code of relentless tension.",Arts/Television & radio,Tehran series two review – Glenn Close adds menace to this breathlessly exciting thriller ,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/06/tehran-series-two-review-glenn-close
5/6/2022,"Multi-instrumentalist and singer Angeline Morrison has long been fascinated with ancient traditions. At 16, she fell in love with the Padstow May Day tradition of the Obby Oss after travelling to see it from her home town of Birmingham. It inspired her to move to Cornwall, where she now works as an academic. Her back catalogue shivers with her interests in psych and folk horror, but her main focus now is on the place of people of colour in British folklore. That will culminate later this year in a project produced by Eliza Carthy, The Sorrow Songs – but first, this collection introduces Morrison’s many talents. Her voice, showcased in the opening a capella, The Green Valley, is sweet but full-bodied. Abundant with meaning and feeling, she tells the story of a woman abandoned after pregnancy with longing, sadness and resilience; its lyrics also suggest factors of race at play. “A contented mind bears no slavery,” she sings. In Our Captain Cried, Morrison’s harmonies are double-tracked with melodies to striking effect; she also plays eerie medieval recorders on The Cruel Mother, strident autoharp on Bonny Cuckoo, and a glistening mountain dulcimer on sacred harp song Idumea. All are produced simply but powerfully by the Lilac Time’s Nick Duffy. Morrison’s version of the well-known ballad When I Was a Young Girl, about a young woman imagining her death, is particularly affecting, slow and solemn against a drone full of dread. The title track about a girl “as brown as brown can be” with “eyes as black as sloe”, is even better, Morrison immersing the listener in a story full of passion, rejection and revenge as she masters the precision of storytelling as well as its poetry. Singer and fiddler Lily Henley’s Oras Dezaordas (Lior Editions) explores ballads dating back to the expulsion of Sephardic Jews from 15th-century Spain, alongside original compositions in the minority language of Ladino. Carrying the voices of women through history, and Henley’s work in American roots music, it’s a fascinating and beautiful release. Ye Vagabonds’ Nine Waves (River Lea) is the second album from Irish brothers Diarmuid and Brían Mac Gloinn. Their blood harmonies remain movingly tender, while Irish contemporary classical group Crash Ensemble add stimulating textures to their songs. Bryony Griffith and Alice Jones’ A Year Too Late and a Month Too Soon (Proper) is fun, too, a spirited collection of old Yorkshire songs about wanton lasses, cockfights and collier lads, inspired by characters from their local communities.",Arts/Music,Angeline Morrison: The Brown Girl and Other Folk Songs review | Jude Rogers's folk album of the month,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/06/angeline-morrison-the-brown-girl-and-other-folk-songs-review
5/6/2022,"This off-the-deep-end satire from political rapper turned film-maker Boots Riley heads for the surreal uplands beloved of Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman. LaKeith Stanfield brings his stoner charm to Cassius (AKA Cash), a poor Oakland resident who finds he is a natural at telemarketing, mainly due to the “white voice” he is encouraged to use on callers. However, his friends, including radical artist girlfriend Detroit (Tessa Thompson), worry he is compromising his morals for money. Riley takes a hardline with the inequities of capitalism – along with sideswipes at Black stereotyping and art world posturing – but it’s done with a playfulness and keen eye for the unexpected.Saturday 7 May, 10pm, BBC Three It’s a bit of a task fitting Dickens’s semi-autobiographical novel into two hours but Armando Iannucci has managed it in most excellent fashion. Dev Patel (the colourblind casting is a masterstroke) plays David, who goes from much-loved son to abused orphan to naive, lovelorn youth, forever surrounded by eccentric characters who fuel his imagination and, ultimately, his writing. Shot in an off-kilter style that echoes Lewis Carroll, it’s a very funny film, with a top-notch cast from Tilda Swinton’s donkey-obsessed Betsey Trotwood to Peter Capaldi’s pathetic Mr Micawber.Saturday 7 May, 9.20pm, Channel 4 If an actor can be elected president, why can’t a 1980s TV cop solve a murder on the Isle of Man?

However, when the main suspect in a woman’s killing demands to speak to Mindhorn, Thorncroft sees a chance to disinter his career … oh, and help the police prevent more deaths, of course. Comically retro action with a high gag count from the cream of UK comic talent.Saturday 7 May, 12.10am, BBC One Quentin Tarantino’s first western is a very violent, blackly comic tale of slavery and retribution in the pre-American civil war south. Jamie Foxx is a fierce presence as Django, a slave who, after being freed by Christoph Waltz’s German bounty hunter Schultz, joins him in his work and then on a mission to free Django’s wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). However, she is owned by powerful Mississippi plantation owner and committed sadist Calvin Candie (a studiedly melodramatic Leonardo DiCaprio). It’s a heady concoction, in love with its own transgressive thrills.Sunday 8 May, 10pm, 5Star For those missing the Roy family’s torrid saga, here’s a fascinating, fact-based exposé of the moral vacuum that comes with extreme wealth. When John Paul Getty III, grandson of US billionaire J Paul Getty, is kidnapped in Italy in 1973, the old miser (a chilly Christopher Plummer) refuses to pay the large ransom. Aghast at his inhumanity, Paul’s mother Gail Harris (Michelle Williams, engrossing as ever) and Getty’s ambivalent deal-maker Chace (Mark Wahlberg) try to keep her teenage son alive.Wednesday 11 May, 1.05am, Film4 Cary Grant always played best with strong, intelligent actresses and Irene Dunne is certainly that in Garson Kanin’s sparky 1940 farce. Seven years after Ellen (Dunne) was lost in a shipwreck, she is declared legally dead and so husband Nick (Grant) marries again. But Ellen survived, having found shelter on a desert island, and returns just in time to gatecrash his honeymoon. Gail Patrick’s blameless second spouse Bianca and Ellen’s fellow survivor – and potential love rival – Stephen (Randolph Scott) add to the confusion. Smart, slapstick stuff, with Dunne in command of both Grant and most of the film.Thursday 12 May, 10.40pm, BBC Four Jason Reitman’s engaging fantasy comedy is a respectful sequel to his father Ivan’s 1980s films (the all-female 2016 take is ignored) but with added stylistic nods to Stranger Things and the Spielberg of Close Encounters and ET. Here, the ghoul-chasers are kids: siblings Trevor (ST’s Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace).

5/6/2022,"The family of a three-year-old girl who was allegedly left in a hot bus for six hours outside her childcare centre in central Queensland say they are hoping for a speedy recovery. Nevaeh Austin was found unconscious on a bus in almost 30C heat by staff about 3pm on Wednesday outside Le Smileys Early Learning Centre in Gracemere. The toddler was flown to Queensland children’s hospital in a critical condition later that night. But her family says, thankfully, her condition has since stabilised. Speaking with Guardian Australia, a family member of Nevaeh said the toddler “was doing well”. The family member did not wish to be named but said she was “relieved” Nevaeh’s recovery appeared to be headed in the right direction. Nevaeh was awake and talking, her grandmother Pamela Parker told Seven News. “She’s squealing, laughing, being silly, poking her tongue out, hiding – she’s doing awesome,” Parker said on Friday. “She is doing great, but at this stage, we don’t know [how long she’ll take to recover].” The Queensland children’s hospital confirmed the toddler was in a stable condition but remained in the intensive care unit. Police say an investigation into how Nevaeh was left on the bus is under way and they are investigating whether “procedures may have been breached”. In a press conference on Thursday, Capricornia police district Det Insp Darrin Shadlow said Nevaeh was the only child who was picked up on Wednesday morning and had been transported by a bus driver and another staff member. He said when staff eventually found Nevaeh in the bus, they performed CPR on the toddler and called triple zero. She was then rushed to Rockhampton hospital before being airlifted to the Queensland children’s hospital. Messages have poured in for the family and the toddler since news of the incident hit social media. A man who identified himself as Nevaeh’s uncle posted an image of the toddler on Facebook and wrote: “#prayforveah. You got this my Lil mate.” A person who identified as a friend of the family also wrote: “Thank you to everyone that has messaged, called or offered help at this horrendous time. Vaeh has Austin in her blood so is fighting her little heart out and has been raised by a tough woman.” Another friend of the family said Nevaeh’s incident had made her realise how “precious” life was, adding: “Hold your babies that little bit tighter tonight.” The Queensland education minister, Grace Grace, said the incident “simply should not have happened” and that her heart went out to the family.“Families need to have peace of mind that when they send their children off to school, kindy or daycare, they will come home safe,” she said in a statement. “My department, as the regulatory authority, is working closely with the [Queensland police service] to ensure we gather all of the facts surrounding this tragic event.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Grace said after the death of a child on a bus in Cairns back in 2020, the government launched the “Look before you lock” campaign aimed at sparking behaviour change among those transporting children. “As a result of this campaign, we have seen the numbers of children being left on buses significantly reducing. However, one child is still too many,” she said. The minister said legislative amendments were made in October 2020 to strengthen obligations on services that transport children. “This included a mandatory requirement for services to have a written policy and procedure for the transportation of children and that these procedures are regularly practised,” Grace said. “So I remind everyone again to look before you lock. It’s a simple practice that must be followed every single time.” The childcare centre did not respond to requests for comment.",News/Australia news,"Toddler allegedly left on childcare bus in almost 30C heat ‘doing well’ in recovery, family says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/toddler-allegedly-left-on-childcare-bus-in-almost-30c-heat-doing-well-in-recovery-family-says
5/6/2022,"Unions have urged Scott Morrison to consider sacking a member of the industrial tribunal for what they describe as “extraordinary and inappropriate” public comments about Labor’s wage policy, which they claim compromise the independence of the commission. The labour economist Mark Wooden reportedly said the Fair Work Commission does not want the government “telling [it] what to do” and Labor was playing “political games” by promising to lift the minimum wage. In a letter to Morrison on Friday the Australian Council of Trade Unions warned that the comments from Wooden, an expert member of the commission’s minimum wage panel, “undermine the independence and impartiality” of a review that sets the pay of 2.2 million Australians. In this year’s minimum wage case, unions have asked for a $2,000 a year increase for the lowest paid, but the Morrison government has followed its usual practice of making a submission that does not nominate a raise of a particular size. While attacking the government’s record on wage stagnation, Labor has pledged it will make a substantive submission to the annual review if elected. Wooden reportedly told the Sydney Morning Herald that “as a member of the independent umpire, I’m very comfortably relieved the governments of the day don’t pressure us to make a particular decision”. “Anthony Albanese is saying we will raise wages, which I think is very interesting since the only lever [the government] have to pull is the wages of the public service … when he says he’s raising wages, it’s just political games.” Wooden reportedly said other aspects of Labor’s industrial relations policy, such as ensuring labour hire workers are paid the same as employees in the businesses in which they are placed could influence wage growth. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, wrote to Morrison on Friday describing Wooden’s comments as “extraordinary and highly inappropriate”. “[Wooden] has inserted himself into the political debate about low wages growth and the skyrocketing cost of living by appearing in today’s media to back in the government’s position.” “Working Australians can have no trust in this process when a member of the expert panel makes such an extraordinary political intervention right in the middle of the federal election campaign,” she said, likening it to a Reserve Bank board member commenting on the political debate about interest rates. She asked for “an immediate investigation into today’s intervention to consider disciplinary action against him, including removal from the panel.” All members of the commission are bound by a code of conduct that requires them to uphold principles including independence and impartiality. It advises members to “avoid involvement in political controversies” including by refraining from expressing views on politically sensitive topics. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Members must also avoid the appearance of bias that might lead a fair-minded observer to reasonably conclude they have not brought an “unprejudiced” mind to a question they must consider. Wooden was appointed to the expert panel for a five-year term in March 2020 by the Morrison government. Labor’s shadow industrial relations minister, Tony Burke, said: “I’m deeply concerned that this intervention by an individual involved in deliberating on the minimum wage jeopardises the integrity of the wage review process,” he said. The Fair Work Act gives the industrial relations minister power to handle complaints about FWC members, and the governor general may suspend or terminate them for misbehaviour. A government spokesperson said: “The government respects the independence of the Fair Work Commission. Mr Wooden’s comments are a matter for him.” Guardian Australia asked Wooden and the FWC for comment.",News/Australia news,ACTU urges Morrison to discipline Fair Work Commission member over ‘extraordinary’ public comments,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/actu-urges-morrison-to-discipline-fair-work-commission-member-over-extraordinary-public-comments
5/6/2022,"To All the Boys I Loved Before, the 2018 Netflix YA hit that launched a franchise and in-house star in Noah Centineo, was integral to the platform’s revival of the rom-com for a reason: it had the ineffable “it” factor. The film, written by Sofia Alvarez and based on the novel by Jenny Han, updated the best of teen romance tropes to the present – awkward yet attractive girl, charismatic yet sensitive Romeo, harmless frenemies; insular school traditions, thwarted flirtations, a good dose of heart and a larger helping of heat. On a streaming platform full of background movies, the first To All the Boys was refreshingly fun to watch. Along for the Ride, the new Netflix teen romance written and directed by Alvarez, misses that spark. A lot of that comes down to its protagonist. Like To All The Boys’ Lara Jean, Along for the Ride’s Auden (named after the poet – yes, she’s a bookworm) is beautiful, thin, decently fashionable, smart, well-read and lives in an upper-middle-class single parent household. Both are neurotic and awkward, and bury their unspoken desires into the fictional worlds of books. But whereas Lana Condor plays Lara Jean with endearing charm and a bit of a wink – she’s ridiculously in her own head – Emma Pasarow’s Auden remains barely makes it out of her shell. She’s inexplicably ill at ease and, despite being eminently enviable, starts the film at her prep school’s graduation with no friends. Auden’s aloofness remains confusing throughout – a flat blankness at the center of a narrative that requires some element of charisma. To quote her co-worker Leah (Genevieve Hannelius) halfway through the film: “I don’t get it. I mean, there were people at our school who were way more awkward than you, and even they had friends.” Auden, too, wants to change, as she baldly states in the opening minutes of the film, based on the novel by YA romance staple Sarah Dessen. Worn down by her exacting professor mother Victoria (Andie MacDowell, playing the role of haughty maternal figure in her sleep) and desirous of change, Auden elects to spend her final summer before college – she has a scholarship to the prestigious, fictional Defriese University – at her father’s house in the sleepy beach town of Colby. Her novelist father Robert (Dermot Mulroney) is too busy to hang out, and repeating the pattern of distracted absenteeism with his infant daughter. Auden’s unsettlingly upbeat stepmother Heidi (Kate Bosworth, throwing all her weight into a Live Laugh Love yoga mom), cracking under the stress of single motherhood in practice if not name, gets Auden a job at her beachwear boutique (whose style Victoria derisively refers to as “cupcake glitter breast implants”). The beats are familiar if thin: withdrawn and standoffish at first, Auden eventually warms to her trio of uninhibited co-workers – Leah, Esther (Samia Finnerty) and Maggie (Laura Kariuki, a standout). And she meets a mysterious, guarded boy: Eli (Belmont Cameli), a BMX biker and fellow insomniac who spots her at 2am reading on the pier. She wants to be a different, less risk-averse person; he wants a “do-over” and an escape from grief following the death of his best friend and BMX partner. Cameli, who looks as if Alex Pettyfer’s character from Magic Mike was transported 10 years into the future, brings a sly imperiousness to Eli that chafes with Pasarow’s bottled, frustratingly flat Auden and dialogue that often leaves her at a loss for words. It’s difficult to distinguish the line between the character’s awkwardness and the performance’s. True to Dessen’s style of YA, Auden and Eli’s courtship is slow, physically and emotionally constrained, and mostly absent physical contact. The climax of sexual tension are two passionate kisses, on which the actors and Alvarez, hovering the shaky camera around their heads, deliver. Their first hook-up scene, in particular, is the high-water mark of movie: spotlit shots of the lovers spliced with the joyous splashes of anonymous friends during a night swim – a scene that begins to capture the spontaneity and butterflies of teenage love and play. That type of spark made, say, the hot tub scene in To All the Boys imprint on the brain, infinitely replayable. There are moments in Along for the Ride – the co-workers’ 6pm dance party, a finale on the beach, camera lingering on the lovers’ bodies in the ocean – where the magic that cements a teen film seems within reach. For a few seconds here or there, you can feel it. The rest of it just passes by like the tide.

5/6/2022,"UK house prices rose again in April, extending the longest run of monthly increases in six years, according to Halifax, but the lender said rising interest rates and squeezed household budgets would cool the market over the next year. The average cost of a home rose by 1.1% in April, the 10th consecutive monthly rise in the longest run since 2016, to a record high of £286,079. The price of the average property is up 10.8% on the same month last year, with homeowners enjoying an almost £50,000 increase in the price of their property over the last two years. Halifax said that the pandemic-fuelled housing boom, marked by buyers in a “race for space” as urban dwellers sought out more rural properties when flexible and remote working took hold, will continue for the time being. “For now, at least, despite the current economic uncertainty, the strong increases we’ve seen in house prices show little sign of abating,” said Russell Galley, the managing director of Halifax. “Housing transactions and mortgage approvals remain above pre-pandemic levels, and the continued growth in new buyer inquiries suggests activity will remain heightened in the short-term. The imbalance between supply and demand persists, with an insufficient number of new properties coming on to the market to meet the needs of prospective buyers and strong competition to secure properties driving up prices.” However, the rate of growth is slowing, with April down on the 1.4% increase in March, and the 11.1% annual rate in the same month, according to Halifax’s monthly property index. On Thursday, the Bank of England raised interest rates from 0.75% to 1% to tackle increasing inflation, which is expected to rise above 10% this year, the highest level since 1982, as home energy bills are expected to jump again in October. “The headwinds facing the wider economy cannot be ignored,” Galley said. “With interest rates on the rise and inflation further squeezing household budgets, it remains likely that the rate of house price growth will slow by the end of this year.” Halifax said housing demand is focused on larger family homes rather than smaller properties such as flats, with the price of detached and semi-detached properties rising 12% annually, compared with 7.1% for apartments. Northern Ireland has overtaken the south-west of England as the UK’s strongest performer in terms of house price rises, up 14.9% year on year to £182,565. The average property in the south-west rose at 14.8% to an average of £301,632. Wales rose 14.2% to £214,396, an all-time high, while Scotland’s slower growth rate of 8.3% still fuelled a new record average of £196,471. Greater London continues to show the slowest rate of growth at 6.2%. However, it also has the highest-priced houses in the UK at an average of £537,896.",News/Business,"UK house prices rise but cost of living crisis will cool market, says Halifax",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/06/uk-house-prices-rise-but-cost-of-living-crisis-will-cool-market-says-halifax
5/6/2022,"Forty-one years since their debut album, Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret, and 20 since their last album, 2002’s underwhelming Cruelty Without Beauty, Soft Cell return with an album that makes the very best of their vantage point as synth-pop elders with an eye on the future. *Happiness Not Included cleverly compares the 80s promises of a future straight out of science-fiction (“rocket ships and monorails, electricity that never fails”) with how things have actually turned out. While these songs reference war, famine, loneliness, isolation and authoritarianism, Marc Almond’s witty lyrics and synth man David Ball’s bouncy tunes mean the mood is more wryly hopeful than bleak. Heart Like Chernobyl actually begins: “Oh dear / I feel like North Korea.” Other songs are outrightly nostalgic. Bruises on All My Illusions gazes not exactly wistfully at Almond’s pre-fame days as a cloakroom attendant. Polaroid cheekily fuses the band’s real 80s meeting with Andy Warhol with an imaginary trip to his 1960s Factory (“Nico danced in oil-wheeled lights and Lou Reed had me in his sights”). But it’s harder to imagine their younger selves coming up with the sublime Light Sleepers, an almost symphonic hymn to outsiders; the serenely lovely, piano-led closer, New Eden, is a similarly an almost classical rallying call for a new society. Such musical progressions happily coexist with trademark electro bangers such as Purple Zone (recently released in a different version with the Pet Shop Boys) which raises a middle finger to ageing with a tune from their top drawer.",Arts/Music,Soft Cell: *Happiness Not Included review – synth-pop elders with an eye on the future,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/06/soft-cell-happiness-not-included-review
