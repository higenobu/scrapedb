1/7/2022,"It’s the first week of January, so it must be time for “high pay day”, the High Pay Centre’s illuminating calculation of the moment at which the average chief executive of a FTSE 100 company will have been paid as much as the average UK worker will earn in the entire year. The imaginary gong will strike at about 9am on Friday morning. That, notably, is slightly later than normal because the thinktank has to use backward-looking data for its exercise and, relatively speaking (a crucial qualification), the FTSE 100 crew had a lean time during the first pandemic year. In 2020, their average pay fell from £3.25m to £2.7m. That was still about 86 times the median earnings of a full-time UK worker but represented a multi-year low ratio-wise.  Do not, though, imagine a trend has been established. Three factors suggest normal service, as viewed from the boardroom, will be restored. First, the FTSE 100 rose 14% in 2021, which will inflate the value of share-based incentives that tend to be the biggest components of large packets. Second, those companies that accepted furlough support from the public purse, and sensibly judged it unacceptable to award boardroom bonuses while doing so, will now feel they’re off the leash. Third, remuneration committees will be under pressure from executives to apply a catchup approach after a year of relative (again) restraint. The only force pushing in the other direction is the shareholders. Here’s Andrew Ninian of the Investment Association, the fund manager’s trade body: “As we recover from the pandemic, investors will be watching to ensure [last year’s] fair approach is maintained.” That is hardly blood and thunder stuff. Prediction: high pay day will fall earlier next January. This time last year, Simon Wolfson, Next’s chief executive, said it was “harder than ever to predict sales and profits for the year ahead”. He’s proved his point in spades because his first stab at a profits forecast was £670m, which has turned out to be a wild underestimate. Five upgrades later, and with only three weeks of Next’s financial year left to run, the group now says it’s on track for £822m. The last flurry was provided by a pre-Christmas rush, including in the shops, not just online. Wolfson describes the horizon-gazing challenge this time as “unusually difficult”, which could almost be regarded as an improvement in clarity versus “harder than ever”. Not by much, though. None of his “five areas of uncertainty” can be called minor. Will the release of pent-up demand, which almost certainly helped in 2021, fade during the year? Will consumers prefer to spend on holidays and going out? Will inflation in food and energy curb spending on clothes and homeware? Will Next’s own price increases, expected to be 6% by the autumn as it absorbs higher shipping costs and wage rises, depress demand? How will consumers react to a 1.25% rise in national insurance plus possible rises in mortgage costs? Yes, that’s a decent summary of the non-Covid trading worries. All would be mitigated by inflation-matching rises in workers’ pay, but therein lies another deep uncertainty. The good news for Next investors is that Wolfson is still pencilling in a 7% increase in sales and a 4.6% gain in profits, taking the latter measure to £860m. But it would be unwise for the rest of the non-food retailing sector to get too excited. Next has proved over a couple of decades that it is the smartest operator in town. It may well find 7% revenue growth within the cost-of-living squeeze; many others won’t get near. The early stock market story of 2022 is the sell-off in US tech stocks, and the best illustration is Rivian, the electric truck and van developer that listed last year at a valuation of $65bn (£48bn) despite having generated no revenues. The stock price more than doubled soon after listing last November, delivering a market value of $150bn, but on Thursday touched its starting level. A specific worry is that Amazon, Rivian’s big backer, unveiled a deal this week to buy battery-powered vans from Stellantis, the former Fiat Chrysler. Nobody should have been shocked by the appearance of competition, of course, and Rivian and Amazon cooed sweetly that their own partnership was solid. But nor, equally, is the market’s reappraisal of Rivian’s worth remotely odd. A company with no revenues was briefly valued at more than Volkswagen, a firm that made profits of €9.7bn (£8.1bn) last year. That was the truly bizarre part. If the tech sell-off gets serious, there is still room to reverse.",News/Business,‘High pay day’ falls a bit later this year – but FTSE bosses need not fear | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/07/high-pay-day-ftse-ceo-pay
1/7/2022,"The bosses of Britain’s biggest companies will have made more money in 2022 by breakfast time on Friday than the average UK worker will earn in the entire year, according to analysis of the vast gap in pay between FTSE 100 chief executives and everyone else. The High Pay Centre, a thinktank that campaigns for fairer pay for workers, said that by 9am on 7 January, the fourth working day of the year, a FTSE 100 chief executive will have been paid more on an hourly basis than the UK worker’s annual salary, based on median average remuneration figures for both groups.  The country’s biggest unions said it was disgraceful that “greedy executives are taking home millions while ordinary workers face yet another year of pay squeezes”, and they demanded that firms be forced to appoint a frontline worker to executive pay committees. FTSE 100 chief executives were paid £2.7m on average in 2020 (the latest full-year figures available), which works out at 86 times the £31,285 average salary for full-time UK workers, according to Office for National Statistics figures. The average CEO pay fell 17% in the 2020 financial year as many bosses took a temporary pay cut at the start of the pandemic and first national lockdown and many of their bonuses were cancelled. It means that this is the first year in a decade that CEOs have had to work into the fourth day of the working year to make the same amount as the average full-time worker in a year. Most FTSE 100 companies have not yet announced CEO pay for their financial year ending in 2021, but 57% of those that have done so have recorded an increase on 2020 levels, the High Pay Centre report said. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “The pandemic has shown us all who keeps the country going during a crisis. There are millions of hardworking people in Britain – from carers, to delivery drivers, to shop floor staff – who give more than they get back, but greedy executives are taking home millions while ordinary workers face yet another year of pay squeezes. “As we emerge from the pandemic we need to redesign the economy to make it fair, and that means big reforms to bring CEO pay back down to earth.” O’Grady said the company committees that set CEO pay must be “required to include workforce representatives who can speak up for a fair balance of pay with ordinary workers. Incentive schemes for company directors should be replaced by profit-share schemes that include the whole workforce. Too much wealth is being hoarded at the top.” Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, the pharmaceutical company that makes the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, was the highest paid, receiving £15.5m. The other top earners were Experian’s Brian Cassin, who got £10.3m, CRH’s Albert Manifold, with £10m, and Berkeley’s Rob Perrins, who collected £8m. Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB union, which represents 600,000 workers, said the figures showed that bosses were paid 173 times the amount collected by carers who risked their lives on the frontline of the pandemic. “Fat cat bosses trousering 173 times more than the carers who look after our loved ones is a disgrace,” he said. “It doesn’t look very levelled up and is everything that’s wrong with our economy. All UK workers must be properly paid and valued if we want to get our post-Covid economy on track.” The Unite union’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “Is it the nurse in an intensive care unit saving the lives of those struck by Covid, or an elite investment banker making millions, who contributes most to society? Which of them stood up for all of us during the pandemic?”",News/Business,Top CEOs to surpass average yearly UK pay after just four days,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/07/ftse-bosses-pay-average-9am
1/7/2022,"The armed forces are being deployed to help hospitals in London deal with a surge in Covid patients because the Omicron variant is leaving so many staff sick and unable to work. Of the 200 military personnel involved, 40 are doctors who will help NHS staff look after patients. The other 160 personnel, who have no medical training, will check in patients, ensure stocks are maintained and would also be “conducting basic checks”, the Ministry of Defence said.  Some have already started work and they are expected to support the NHS in the capital until the end of the month. The announcement comes two days after Boris Johnson said he hopes England can “ride out” the current wave of Covid-19 without further restrictions, but did acknowledge parts of the NHS would feel “temporarily overwhelmed” by Omicron. Health union leaders, although grateful for the help, have said this latest move means the government can no longer be “dismissive” of concerns about “delivering safe care”. Thousands of NHS staff have been off work each week in London, which last month became the first part of the country to see a huge wave of Covid cases caused by the new strain, leaving hospitals struggling to cope with unprecedented levels of staff absence. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of hospitals group NHS Providers, welcomed the assistance from personnel from what is thought to be all three armed forces. But he said that their arrival underlined the extent of NHS understaffing. “Trust leaders will welcome the support of colleagues from the armed forces during what continues to be an incredibly challenging time for the NHS in London. “The fact that we need to call upon army medics and general duty personnel at all underlines the sheer scale of the workforce challenges the NHS is facing. “The experience of the pandemic makes plain underlying issues which need resolution – the need for a national long-term plan for the health and care workforce, ongoing challenges with vacancies and recruitment pre-dating the pandemic by a number of years.” Hospitals elsewhere in England, which are seeing dramatic increases in Covid admissions, may also seek military aid, Hopson added. The news came as the UK reported a further 179,756 Covid cases on Thursday, with the number of people infected with the Omicron variant continuing to increase rapidly. The latest figures – which reflect infections picked up by testing – bring the UK total for the past seven days to 1,272,131, up 29% on the week before. The true number of infections is estimated to be substantially higher as not all infections are captured by the testing programme. The data also showed that in England there are 17,988 Covid patients in hospital, up from 15,659 the day before, with a further 231 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test reported in the UK on Thursday. Military personnel have helped out in hospitals in previous waves of the pandemic and continue to assist the ambulance services in Wales and Scotland and have also been helping the booster programme. The Royal College of Nursing said the deployment proved that the NHS is critically short of staff and asked for assurances that those involved have the skills to help look after patients. “The government can no longer deny the staffing crisis in the NHS. The prime minister and others can no longer be dismissive of questions about the ability of NHS staff to deliver safe care,” said Patricia Marquis, its nursing director for England. “Once the military has been brought in, where does the government turn next in a bid to ‘ride out’ the wave rather than deal with it? “Nursing staff might welcome any extra help at work right now, but we need to know that the government isn’t compromising patient and professional standards in any way.” Hopson earlier said soaring infection rates in the north of England mean that one NHS trust expects to have 30% more Covid cases next week than it had at the last peak. He fears that hospitals outside the capital will not be as able to cope with the new wave of admissions as those in London. He said this was because they had deeper staffing problems, higher levels of sickness and absence, older populations and in some cases worse social care provision. Some trusts outside London have as many as 19% of their staff absent because of Covid, much higher than the 10% off sick or isolating that other NHS organisations have been reporting, he added.",News/World news,Military deployed at London hospitals due to Omicron staff shortages,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/military-deployed-at-london-hospitals-due-to-omicron-staff-shortages
1/7/2022,"Swindon and Manchester City were regular combatants in the 1990s, meeting in the second tier and during Swindon’s one season in the Premier League, 1993-94. Friday’s visit to the County Ground will be a first meeting in 20 years. On 5 January 2002, former Swindon man Kevin Horlock scored the second in a 2-0 home win at Maine Road. The years since have seen the clubs move in radically different trajectories, and they now operate on different planets. Swindon arrested a slump with a 5-2 defeat of Northampton on New Year’s Day, and lie in the League Two play-off positions. The club have explained price hikes for this game “due to the historical financial issues that were inherited” from the previous ownership. City, clear at the top of the Premier League, have this week been strengthening their finances further by adding an Abu Dhabi-based renewable energy company to their sponsorship portfolio. JB  Swindon v Manchester City, Friday 8pm (all times GMT) As the old maxim goes, Huddersfield always win the Cup when the year ends in 22, especially if they get to visit Turf Moor along the way. They played there twice en route to lifting the trophy for the first and only time in 1922, ousting Burnley at the start of their campaign before beating Notts County at Turf Moor in the semi-final. So we can be certain that, before Saturday’s tie at Burnley, Carlos Corberán will rev his charges up with tales of heroes such as Billy Smith, the scorer of their winner at Wembley back in the day and – by the by – the first player in English football to find the net directly from a corner. With both teams beset by Covid-related problems, and Huddersfield fighting for promotion from the Championship while Burnley battle against relegation from the Premier League, it is difficult to predict the lineups of each side, but it would not be a major shock if the visitors knocked out the Clarets. PD Burnley v Huddersfield, Saturday 12.30pm Boreham Wood have developed a taste for beating Football League opposition in recent years, having broken their duck by defeating Blackpool in the first round of the FA Cup in 2017-18. Last season they beat Southend on penalties in the first round of a run that ended with defeat to Millwall in the third. They have reached the stage this time without facing an EFL club, having seen off Barnet and Eastleigh, also winning a local derby with St Albans City to get this far. Wimbledon have found League One something of a struggle lately, not least due to Covid cancellations. A stern letter to authorities demanded the league “implement the strongest-possible measures to ensure that – where a club is able to fulfil a fixture – it does so”. Mark Robinson’s team looked rusty in losing to Oxford during their one Christmas assignment, but 1,200 Dons will be making the trip to the other side of the London conurbation. JB Boreham Wood v AFC Wimbledon, Saturday 3pm The lowest-ranked team left in this year’s competition, Kidderminster Harriers sit fifth in the National League North and will fancy their chances of causing an upset against a Reading side more interested in Championship survival than any sort of Cup run. A capacity crowd of more than 5,000 will pack the intimate environs of Aggborough for the arrival of Veljko Paunovic’s second-tier strugglers and the Royals’ Serbian manager has said he will rest plenty of first-choice players for an encounter that precedes four league games in 12 days for his team. “We have to approach the game on Saturday in the best possible way and in our best interests,” he said, no doubt aware that what serves his best interests will also benefit those of his opposite number, Russell Penn. Having had their past three games postponed, Kidderminster’s players enjoyed a restful festive period, while the striker Ashley Hemmings will be confident of adding to goals he scored against Grimsby and Halifax in the first and second rounds. BG Kidderminster v Reading, Saturday 3pm That St James’ Park is a sell-out for the visit of Cambridge is not so much a tribute to Mark Bonner’s team, or perhaps a last chance to see the mercurial talents of Wes Hoolahan. Or even the chance for the Geordie nation to see Kieran Trippier unveiled on the hallowed turf. Instead, and despite the club’s lowly position in the Premier League, a fountain of optimism continues to gush on Tyneside. Whatever the providence of the Saudi Arabian cash that will fund their January recruitment drive, a not-Mike Ashley bounce continues among the club’s fans. A Covid-hit Christmas and no game since 27 December has also left the public wanting more, and there was much to get excited about in that night’s 1-1 draw with Manchester United. An FA Cup run would be a distraction for Eddie Howe but perhaps one that could help fuel the battle against relegation. JB Newcastle v Cambridge, Saturday 3pm With automatic promotion back to the Premier League the club’s overriding ambition, Valérien Ismaël made no apology for practically forfeiting West Brom’s place in the Carabao Cup this season by fielding a back-up side against Arsenal, who cavorted to a 6-0 win in August. We will never know for sure whether Ismaël would have opted for a similar approach to the FA Cup, since circumstances have made the choice for him: injuries, suspension and international duty mean the Baggies could be without up to 10 first-team players when they host Brighton on Saturday. Graham Potter best make sure he picks a team strong enough to progress because there is no justification for Brighton not taking a serious tilt at the Cup this season. Last year they slumped out in the fifth round after fielding a weakened side at Leicester, who, of course, went on to lift the trophy. Hopefully Potter has learned from that. PD West Brom v Brighton, Saturday 3pm The architects of one of the most mind-blowing FA Cup runs in living memory, when as a third-tier side they were robbed by poor officiating and the absence of goal-line technology in their 1997 semi-final against Middlesbrough, Chesterfield have an opportunity to recreate the magic of yore when they take on Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. The European champions are second in the Premier League, while their visitors sit 92 places below them, banging on the door of the Football League. Unbeaten in 14 games under the management of the 38-year-old James Rowe, Chesterfield were actually the first visiting team in history to win a League game at Stamford Bridge, in 1905, and will be hoping history of a sort can repeat itself in the first encounter between the clubs in 72 years. Whatever the outcome, this glamour tie and the financial windfall that comes with it is a thoroughly deserved reward for those behind the Chesterfield FC Community Trust, who have performed such sterling work since securing the purchase of the club 17 months ago. BG Chelsea v Chesterfield, Saturday 5.30pm Yeovil and Bournemouth share Alec Stock in common. The FA Cup made Stock’s name, from leading Southern League Yeovil to a famous defeat of first division Sunderland in 1949 and then taking second division Fulham to losing the final in 1975. Bournemouth was the final stop in a long managerial career for the man whose lugubrious, wistful tones inspired the Fast Show’s Ron Manager. Yeovil, back in non-league after a lengthy stay in the Football League ended in 2019, look to repeat the heroics of 1949 in toppling Bournemouth, who lead the Championship. Mid-table in the National League, it would be quite the achievement for Darren Sarll’s team, though they may be aided by a Covid outbreak that led to the postponement of Bournemouth’s match with Peterborough on Monday. Should the game go ahead, Scott Parker is likely to have his selection limited for the club’s first ever FA Cup visit to Yeovil. JB Yeovil Town v Bournemouth, Saturday 5.45pm Harrogate Town first entered the FA Cup in 1919 but this will be their first appearance in the third round, marking another milestone in the rise of a club enjoying an impressive second season in the Football League despite a recent dip in results. The decision to turn full-time four years ago has borne sweet fruit for the club, and Simon Weaver, who is in his 13th year in charge, can now claim to be the longest-serving league manager. Weaver has already led the team to Wembley glory – they won the 2020 FA Trophy – and will be aiming to build on good wins in the previous rounds over Wrexham and Portsmouth when they travel to Luton, another enchanting first. The returns of the defenders Rory McArdle and Will Smith from injuries could boost their chances of upsetting the Championship side. PD Harrogate v Luton, Sunday 12.30pm The FA Cup ought to be a priority for both Manchester United and Aston Villa. In Scotland with Rangers, Steven Gerrard concentrated on winning the league. Villa are a club of considerable ambition and with the top four beyond reach and the relegation battle not too much of a concern, a run to Wembley can be considered. What of United? Roy Keane, in a late-2021 pundit-off with Jamie Carragher, suggested that Cristiano Ronaldo had been signed to win “the cups”. United are staring down five years without a trophy, the longest drought since winning this competition in 1983 followed 1977’s FA Cup win. Behind the scenes, and on the back pages, there are suggestions United’s players are struggling with Ralf Rangnick’s lack of celebrity, as well as his 4-2-2-2 formation. There is already a whiff of Roy Hodgson’s ill-suited regime at Liverpool about the German’s appointment.

1/7/2022,"Anyone who has watched Ruben Östlund’s magnificent 2014 Alpine misadventure can see how tricky it could be to transpose from screen to stage, especially a modestly sized one. After all, its MacGuffin is a thunderous avalanche across the French Alps that sparks marital distrust and meltdown during a family skiing trip. Michael Longhurst has taken on the precipitous challenge but for all the comic additions in Tim Price’s adaptation, quirky downsizing in Jon Bausor’s set design and heroic performances all round, this feels like the realisation of an impossible dare.  The set is dazzling white and angled to look like a slope; wisely, it does not seek to emulate the visual vastness of Östlund’s film but still feels a little too confined. The production amps up the kooky and comic inflections that the film combined so masterfully with family tension, trauma and charges of selfishness and betrayal that the avalanche triggers. Harried mother Ebba (Lyndsey Marshal) rushes to protect her children (Florence Hunt and Henry Hunt on this night, both excellently stroppy) while high-earning father Tomas (Rory Kinnear) rushes to save himself – or so the argument goes. But the overall result is less spikily ambiguous comedy drama than silly sitcom. The bigger questions around human survival and the possibility that men and women may behave in different, Darwinian ways feels largely lost. Maybe it is because these questions and their emotional ripples hang on the effects triggered by the avalanche which, in this production, is simply not terrifying enough, though there is a brave attempt with blasts of dry ice and a vibrating crescendo of sound. Where Touching the Void, another mountain-bound adaptation, managed to conjure high stakes on stage, this drama never quite emanates enough physical danger. The kooky humour seems overegged, too: skiers who look as if they have strolled off a Pepsi Max advert glide past this awkwardly British-looking family (though they stick to the original version and say they are from Sweden). A man with a vacuum cleaner who pops up at all the wrong moments feels like an overplayed joke. Vivaldi’s Four Seasons is used as an arch accompaniment, as in the film, but there is also high energy club music that conjures a certain Eurobeat vibe but feels slightly thrown in for good measure. There is a nifty ski path across the stage and minor characters sweep down it. But the central family gestures comically at skiing, while staying static, and thumping music gives them the appearance of performing moves at a dry ski-slope centre simulator. The script is weakest when it strays from the original screenplay. One added scene features an argument between Tomas and the hotel manager over a lost doorkey swab that is underpowered in its humour. Kinnear is watchable enough, as he always is, but both his and Marshal’s characters seem flattened and we wonder if the permanently lost look is Tomas’s or Kinnear’s own for having so little room to manoeuvre in the part. He is also, perhaps, a little too hapless to pass off as an alpha male who will not own up to his fear, cowardice or rank selfishness. The story’s penultimate scene, in which he rescues Ebba on the slopes – so ambiguous in the film that it feels almost surreal – spells out its meaning here and feels incredibly clumsy for it. The finale takes place around a jammed lift rather than the aborted coach journey of the film and it just does not feel satisfactory enough, giving the production a sense of limping to its end.

1/7/2022,"The number of adults living with dementia worldwide is on course to nearly triple to 153 million by 2050, according to the first study of its kind. Experts described the data as shocking and said it was clear that dementia presented “a major and rapidly growing threat to future health and social care systems” in every community, country and continent.  US researchers said the dramatic rise from an estimated 57 million cases in 2019 would be primarily due to population growth and ageing. However, several risk factors for dementia – including obesity, smoking and high blood sugar – would also fuel the increase, they said. Improvements in global education access are projected to reduce global dementia prevalence by 6.2 million cases by 2050. But this will be countered by anticipated trends in obesity, high blood sugar and smoking, which are expected to result in an extra 6.8 million dementia cases. The Global Burden of Disease study is the first to provide forecasting estimates for adults aged 40 and older across 195 countries worldwide. The findings are published in the Lancet Public Health. Dementia cases will rise in every country, with the largest growth in north Africa and the Middle East (367%) and eastern sub-Saharan Africa (357%). The countries projected to record the largest rises worldwide are Qatar (1,926%), the United Arab Emirates (1,795%) and Bahrain (1,084%). The smallest estimated increases are in the high-income Asia Pacific (53%) and western Europe (74%), the study suggests. Japan is expected to have the smallest increase in the world at 27%. In the UK, the number of dementia cases is projected to increase by 75%, from just over 907,000 in 2019 to almost 1.6 million in 2050. Hilary Evans, the chief executive of Alzheimer’s Research UK, who was not involved in the study, said the figures “lay bare the shocking scale of dementia across the world”. She said: “We need to see concerted global action to avoid this number tripling. Dementia doesn’t just affect individuals, it can devastate whole families and networks of friends and loved ones. The heartbreaking personal cost of dementia goes hand in hand with huge economic and societal impacts, strengthening the case to governments across the world to do more to protect lives now and in the future.” Dementia is already one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people globally, with costs in 2019 estimated at more than $1tn (£750bn). Although dementia mainly affects older people, it is not an inevitable consequence of ageing. A Lancet commission in 2020 suggested up to 40% of cases could be prevented or delayed if exposure was eliminated to 12 known risk factors: low education, high blood pressure, hearing impairment, smoking, midlife obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, social isolation, excessive alcohol consumption, head injury and air pollution. The researchers behind the new study called for more aggressive prevention efforts to reduce dementia risk through lifestyle factors such as education, diet and exercise, alongside research to discover effective disease-modifying treatments and new modifiable risk factors to reduce the future burden of disease. The lead author, Emma Nichols, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, said: “To have the greatest impact, we need to reduce exposure to the leading risk factors in each country. For most, this means scaling up locally appropriate, low-cost programmes that support healthier diets, more exercise, quitting smoking, and better access to education.” The authors acknowledged their analysis was limited by a lack of high-quality data in several parts of the world and by studies using different methodologies and definitions of dementia.",News/Society,"Number of adults with dementia to exceed 150m by 2050, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/06/number-adults-with-dementia-exceed-150-million-2050-study
