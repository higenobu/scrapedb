1/31/2022,"The prime minister and chancellor have bolted themselves together in a mutual destruction pact. Come hell or high water, the national insurance rise will happen, rudely snubbing a campaign by the Daily Mail. The Tory right wants no tax rises and no spending, while Labour wants the highest tax burden to be paid by those who have the most. But instead of hitting older people, or the unearned income of rich people, this tax will be paid by young people. It’s a political shocker: the NI rise will take £255 a year from typical earnings, in perfect synchronicity with the explosion in fuel bills, council tax rises and inflation, which is on track to reach 6% by April. The government has also ruled out abolishing VAT on fuel, another regressive tax. This is an epic case of political and policy mismanagement.  The tax hike is intended to keep Boris Johnson’s pledge to solve social care “once and for all”. But virtually none of the money from this tax hike will reach care. Most of it will be consumed by the 6 million-long NHS waiting list. Johnson’s promise that “nobody needing care should be forced to sell their home to pay for it” is so badly framed that it will reverse his promises to “level up” the UK: the regressive £86,000 cap paid by everyone with property or savings is a flat tax, so those in the north with cheaper properties may lose everything, while owners of more valuable southern homes can expect to pay just a portion of their wealth. Every aspect of this policy seems designed to anger almost everyone while failing to tackle the real crisis that leaves a million and a half people with no care, while care homes and domiciliary services tumble into bankruptcy. The government has proposed no real reforms to this chaotic system. One of Margaret Thatcher’s most destructive privatisation programmes was forcing councils to shed care homes by only subsidising residents in private homes. The result was that a hotch-potch of private providers emerged in the following years, from small family businesses to huge private-equity companies and property asset-strippers that loaded care homes with debt. There has always been tension over the division between NHS and social care. The health and care bill now bumping through parliament creates “integrated care systems”, designed to pool resources between councils and the NHS. This may work in some co-operative areas, but it’s already clear that merging two hard-pressed sectors is too fraught to work. Who’s to blame for record numbers of NHS beds blocked this winter by patients waiting for social care? Even before Covid, these numbers were rising. From 2014-15, there were 1.6m total delayed bed days in England, when frail people languished in hospital due to the lack of a care package or care home place. But here, for once, is a bright glimmer of light. As far away from Westminster as NHS England stretches, Northumbria Healthcare trust is showing how health and social care can be merged – and it is doing so by reversing Thatcher’s social care privatisation. It is insourcing care, bringing it under the wing of the NHS. Sir James Mackey, chief executive of the Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation, returned in 2017 from a secondment to a national role as head of NHS improvement, full of innovations. Here’s how the Northumbrian plan works: Mackey’s trust has bid for social care contracts from local authorities that would usually be awarded to private providers. The NHS foundation will seamlessly integrate domiciliary care within the health service. Mackey plans to build care homes to take over residential contracts too, if he can raise the capital. Here is a smooth transition without bottlenecks between the two sectors, with health and social care funded from the same budget, with every incentive to stop people needing a hospital bed and to get them home quicker when they do. Gaining only a nugatory share of this new levy, local authorities, which have suffered severe cuts over the last decade, still won’t be able to afford to put more money towards social care. Better still, Northumbria is integrating what will be 250 care staff between the two services, so they are all on the same NHS agenda for change pay scale, preventing the flight of underpaid care workers to other sectors. Where care was often a dead-end job, Northumbria offers an NHS career path with training for everyone from porters and cleaners upwards. How can Mackey afford more generous pay, I ask? “Private equity takes 8-10% in profit, but we can spend that on better conditions for staff. I want home carers to have the chance to become directors of nursing,” he says. To this end, he is building a health and care training academy with Northumbria University and has helped to set up a profitable factory making scrubs and PPE. “Why buy from China when we can employ people here?” Next comes a laundry and a sterile services unit, such as the NHS used to run in the days before outsourcing. What’s the catch? This fortunate trust is exceptional. It has less debt than most, fewer vacancies and a waiting list backlog so short it will probably be gone by April. Northumbria’s problems are social, Mackey says: “High unemployment, inequality, poor education cause the worst disease burden. Levelling up? Give us the money to do what we need locally.” Trusts around the country are flocking to see how Northumbria does it, though most are too sunk under debts, mile-long waiting lists and workforce crises to follow this path. Imagine if they could. The NHS could solve the social care crisis with a seamless gold-standard service that is as good for care staff as it is for patients. But first the health service needs to be freed from the crushing pressures it faces after a decade during which it has received the lowest ever level of funding. Instead, the Johnson-Sunak NI tax rise comes with no plan for any solution.

1/31/2022,"Another week, another war of words between the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) and the Professional Jockeys Association (PJA): two bodies which seem to be, for the moment at least, in a state of perpetual antipathy. The latest dispute concerns the BHA’s announcement last week that the 3lb Covid allowance for riders, which has been in place since June 2020, will be replaced by a general 2lb rise in the weights from 26 March. The allowance was introduced when racing emerged from lockdown in June 2020, but with weighing-room saunas off-limits to maintain social distancing. Jockeys – or the 250 or so that responded to a survey – subsequently voted to keep the saunas closed, but apparently in the expectation that the 3lb allowance would be retained.  Instead, the BHA – which also consulted with trainers as any rise in the weights has potential welfare implications at the other end of the scale – has opted for a general 2lb rise. A pound – or 453 grams in new money – might not sound like very much, and for some riders at least, it is not. For others, though, the ones who are engaged in an eternal battle against their own bodies, it feels as if the BHA is, fairly literally, insisting on its pound of flesh. Adam Kirby, last year’s Derby winner, is certainly in that group, and was one of the first to criticise the BHA’s plan last week. “I don’t get why the allowance was a problem in the first place,” Kirby told Sky Sports Racing. “Three pounds is a massive help to us. It’s no hindrance whatsoever to the horses. Track records have been broken and horse soundness is good.” The BHA, on the other hand, would argue that it needs to see the issue more generally, and take the views of other stakeholders into account. That includes both trainers and owners, who would rightly be concerned about the effect of rising weights on young horses in particular – the great majority of Flat horses, after all, are still growing and developing throughout their careers – and also the sport’s other major source of funding: the punters. In this respect, the BHA is rightly concerned about an increasing disparity in recent years between the published weights on the racecards and the actual weight in a horse’s saddle. Riders already get an allowance for their body protector, which was raised from 2lb to 3lb when the more effective Level Two protector became mandatory in 2018. Flat jockeys also get a further 1lb “warm clothing” allowance in the winter months. With the Covid allowance too, this means that the rider of a horse set to carry top weight of 9st 12lb in a Flat handicap this afternoon could actually tip the scales at 10st 5lb without being flagged as “overweight”. There is, of course, an argument that the relative weight is what matters, and that Horse A is still be giving 2lb to B if that is what their respective handicap marks say it should. But this assumes, for instance, that the relationship between weight carried and a horse’s performance is linear, even as actual burdens increase well beyond 10st. Dale Gibson, the acting chief executive of the PJA following the recent departure of Paul Struthers, has suggested that there is data – as yet unpublished – which shows that “the 3lb allowance was not affecting results”. Nor is it entirely clear how many jockeys will be seriously impacted by the change. How many, for instance, were using saunas on a regular basis in the first place? Was it something that many jockeys resorted to occasionally, or a handful used almost daily? Top weights in Flat handicaps in 2019 – the only full year in which the 3lb allowance was in place – actually had a better strike rate (19%) than in any of the five years from 2015 to 2019, when it was 17.25% overall and ranged from 16.86% to 17.91%, which does not suggest that the unpublished extra poundage has held them back. In a general sense, though, it seems only fair and right that the gap between published and actual weights should be minimised as much as possible. On the other hand, riders have been getting taller, stronger and therefore heavier for decades and there is no reason to think the trend will stop any time soon. The sport needs several hundred healthy, professional and dedicated jockeys to maintain the punters’ supply of competitive races, many of whom, on the Flat in particular, will be maintaining a body weight from one year to the next that their genes have an issue with. The latest 2lb is unlikely to be the last, in other words, and when a rider like Kirby, who is at the sharpest end of that daily struggle right now, speaks out, it is probably a good time to listen.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: listen to jockeys in battle of the scales with racing’s rulers,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/31/talking-horses-listen-to-jockeys-in-battle-of-the-scales-with-racings-rulers-horse-racing-tips
1/31/2022,"Output from China’s manufacturing sector slowed to its weakest in almost two years in January as the country’s tough anti-Covid measures forced factories into temporary shutdowns. A monthly snapshot of industry in the world’s second biggest economy showed production being hard hit by Beijing’s zero-tolerance approach to the pandemic.  The Caixin/Markit purchasing managers’ index dropped from 50.9 in December to 49.1 in January – putting pressure on China’s policymakers to step up support for the flagging economy. A reading below 50 suggests output is contracting rather than expanding, with January’s figure the weakest since February 2020, when blanket restrictions were in force during the first wave of the Covid-19 virus. Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, said: “Over the past month, there were Covid-19 flare-ups in several regions in China, underscoring the downward pressure on the economy. “Both supply and demand in the manufacturing sector weakened. Several regions tightened epidemic control measures following the resurgence, which impacted production and sales of manufactured goods. The subindexes for output and total new orders in January fell to their lowest since August. Overseas demand shrank at an even faster pace.” Wang said the spread of the Omicron variant overseas hit China’s external demand, with the gauge for new export orders in January the lowest in 20 months. Craig Botham, the chief China economist at Pantheon Macro, said: “A spike in Covid cases – a mix of Delta and Omicron – is the primary driver of the slowdown in January, along with factory closures ahead of the lunar new year holiday, and a smattering of production limits to limit air pollution during the Winter Olympics.” Meanwhile, growth figures for the eurozone showed output in the single currency zone has returned to pre-pandemic levels. According to the EU’s statistical agency, Eurostat, gross domestic product in the eurozone rose by 0.3% in the final three months and by 5.2% in 2021 as a whole. The quarterly growth rate eased from the 2.3% recorded in the third quarter, following the reintroduction of restrictions to slow the spread of the virus. A breakdown by country found a marked divergence in growth, with the eurozone’s biggest economy, Germany, contracting by 0.7% while France, Italy and Spain – the next largest – all expanded. France grew by 0.7% in the final three months of 2021, Italy by 0.6% and Spain by 2%. Fourth-quarter growth figures for the UK have yet to be released.",News/World news,Rise in Covid cases slows manufacturing in China to weakest in two years,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/rise-in-covid-cases-slows-manufacturing-in-china-to-weakest-in-two-years
1/31/2022,"A northern English outpost of the Eden Project has moved a step closer to reality after councillors in Lancashire granted planning permission for the £125m eco-attraction. Eden Project North, which would be built in giant, transparent domes on Morecambe’s promenade, is being presented to government as a “shovel-ready” initiative that could help boost the deprived seaside town.  Eden has asked for £70m in public money towards the £125m educational project, which it says will “reimagine the British seaside resort for the 21st century”. The investment would inject £200m a year into the north-west economy, it says. An estimated 400 people would be directly employed at Eden Project North, which will combine a range of indoor and outdoor experiences all based on connecting people with Morecambe Bay and helping them to understand and protect the marine environment. The attraction could open in 2024 if the government stumps up the necessary startup cash. The latest milestone for the Morecambe project comes after years of development and extensive community consultation. David Harland, chief executive of Eden Project International, said: “The project is now definitively shovel-ready and a compelling financial case has been made to government. We are primed and ready to create this beacon to a green and sustainable future, be part of ‘levelling up’ and drive economic and social enhancements across the region. “While we are incredibly proud of what we and our partners have achieved so far, we now need UK government support to quickly bring this to fruition and maintain momentum.” Caroline Jackson, the leader of Lancaster city council, said: “Eden Project North promises to be the most significant project in our district for a generation. It will provide huge benefits to our economy through a commitment to local purchasing and creation of good local jobs, as well as shining a light on sustainable regeneration. “The granting of planning permission is a major milestone in the project and all that remains now is for the government to show the same commitment and provide the necessary funding to make it a reality.” David Morris, the local Conservative MP, said: “I have been meeting with ministers for quite some time now and we are in the advanced stages of securing a funding package to allow the project to start being built. “Planning being granted gives this funding ask greater precedence and I look forward to being able to make a further announcement shortly on the work I have been doing with ministers behind the scenes.”",News/UK news,Lancashire grants planning permission for Eden Project North,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/31/lancashire-planning-permission-eden-project-north
1/31/2022,"For the past fortnight Sue Gray’s report on “partygate” has been hovering over Downing Street like a huge vulture, seeking only somewhere to land. A redacted version is expected imminently. In the meantime, Boris Johnson is panicking. For partygate he has substituted policygate, a wild orgy of populist pronouncements designed to show he is still in charge. If Johnson cannot lie himself out of trouble, perhaps he can bribe himself out of it. What do you want, everyone? I would get the Treasury to let you off extra taxes, if only that mean Rishi Sunak would let me. I can promise help with gas bills and heating allowances. I can shower the north of England with money and mayors. I can let you visit your loved ones in care homes, perhaps. I can even get on a plane, fly east and pretend to threaten Vladimir Putin with war.  I can remind the country of my Brexit triumph by cutting £1bn in bureaucracy. I can let NHS staff off vaccinations and get tough on oligarchs’ boltholes. I can promise to sack the Downing Street madhouse staff and move my office to the House of Commons tearoom. I can leave Carrie in charge. British government is experiencing the reality of personality politics. There is no cabinet government, just cabals of courtiers, rivals and enemies. There is no democratic legislature, just an alternative court in waiting. Leadership has no recourse to ideology, to principles, even to a programme. Party has no meaning beyond opinion polls. The one guiding fixation of the UK government is its leader’s desire to stay in power. It is unlikely that the outcome of the contest between Sue Gray’s report on partygate and the Metropolitan police’s inquiry was a deliberate save-Johnson tactic. That suggests a cunning beyond the wit of the present Downing Street. It rather indicates the collapse of parliament as any sort of monitor of standards in public life. But, at the end of the day, Gray will have taken the heat off the prime minister. He has been given a last desperate throw of the dice. That it takes the imminence of defenestration to concentrate Johnson’s mind on government is comment enough on his leadership. His posturing against Russia is an absurd diversion. He has lost his battle with Sunak on the rise in national insurance. His daily one-man conduct of the health sector is whimsical and extravagant. The cabinet and parliamentary party are now aware, with varying degrees of explicitness, that they have a prime minister unable to conduct coherent cabinet government. His usefulness to them has solely been to win elections. He has done this in the past through charm. He now seeks to do it by brazen survival instinct, by fight not flight. The moment to topple Johnson was by a vote of his MPs a fortnight ago. The Sue Gray/Cressida Dick fiasco has awarded him time to assemble his fair-weather friends and cajole, bribe and bully them into giving him another chance. Johnson’s patronage, like his VIP contracts, must have yielded some tidy debts to be called in. There is a sense in Westminster that his darkest hour may have passed. The vulture still hovers, but Johnson’s luck has held and its feathers appear to have been plucked, at least for a while. And in politics a while is an age.

1/31/2022,"Shot in a Victorian hothouse in South Africa with a mixed cast of local actors and the odd imported Brit – including Jessica Alexander, soon be seen in Disney’s live-action The Little Mermaid – this tense dystopian horror-thriller feels geographically non-specific, almost as if it were taking place in some kind of dream world. That touch of hazy vagueness is just right for SA director and co-writer Kelsey Egan’s cracking feature debut (co-written with Emma Lungiswa De Wet) which imagines a family of survivors hiding out in the title’s botanical conservatory after a pandemic has ravaged most of the world’s population. The invisible threat here is an airborne virus called “the shred” which wipes out memories and leaves its victims in a bestial state, unable to remember even their own names. A matriarchal woman known only as Mother (Adrienne Pearce) guides her three female progeny – cautious Evie (Anja Taljaard), dreamy Bee (Alexander) and adolescent Daisy (Kitty Harris), alongside shred-infected brother Gabe (Brent Vermeulen) – by teaching them how to garden (they have to pollinate the plants themselves because the bees are all gone), to read, paint, and pass on the stories of the Before Times.  Most importantly of all, they’ve ritualised the practice of killing anyone who comes near their home; then they eat the best bits of the invader and compost the rest to fertilise the pumpkin and strawberry plots. (This so relatable because so many of us got into gardening over lockdown as well as learning new skills around the house.) But when a handsome young man (Hilton Pelser) who seems unscathed by the shred arrives and the women only injure instead of killing him, they warily nurse him back to health. Could he be their long lost brother Luca, who left years ago as a teenager? Without any means of recording people’s faces – other than painting – fallible, fragile memory is all they have to go on. Egan and her team have dressed the cast in floaty white linens with lace and quasi-Victorian accessories, so they all look like Picnic at Hanging Rock; it is a dainty, craft-centric look that makes a refreshing change from the Burning Man bric-a-brac of most post-apocalyptic cinema. Plus it evokes the American civil war-era-set drama The Beguiled, made originally with Clint Eastwood in 1971 and then remade recently by Sofia Coppola, which is also a story about an injured man infiltrating a female-dominated space. Glasshouse takes the resulting themes and really runs with them, working up the material into a sinister, seductive meditation on memory, desire and loss.  Glasshouse is released on 7 February on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,Glasshouse review – dreamy dystopian horror with a Picnic at Hanging Rock vibe,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/31/glasshouse-review-dreamy-dystopian-horror-with-a-picnic-at-hanging-rock-vibe
1/31/2022,"Norma Waterson, who has died aged 82, was one of the finest and most versatile singers of the British folk revival. She spent most of her life singing traditional songs, many from her native east Yorkshire, in two highly successful groups, the Watersons and Waterson:Carthy, in which she was joined by other members of her family. But her no-nonsense, soulful and unashamedly emotional approach was well-suited to a wide variety of other musical styles, as she displayed in the solo recordings and collaborations with Eliza Carthy, her daughter, that won her a following far beyond the folk scene. She was a hard-working, prolific artist who refused to stop recording or touring, and was singing as well in her 70s as she had in her 20s. Her final album, Anchor (2018), was the second that she had recorded with Eliza, and was a typically varied and experimental affair. It included Norma singing lead on a dramatic, jazz-edged treatment of the Tom Waits song Strange Weather and on a gently powerful version of Nick Lowe’s The Beast in Me.  The duo’s award-winning debut album, Gift (2010), was followed by a tour, during which Norma fell seriously ill, suffering from heart problems. She recovered, and returned to her home in Robin Hood’s Bay, on the Yorkshire coast, cared for by her husband, the singer and guitarist Martin Carthy, and Eliza. Although she found it hard to travel, she wanted to continue singing, and performed at the local annual festival, Normafest, set up in her honour. Her last such appearance was in January 2018. Norma was brought up in the port of Hull, Yorkshire, by her maternal grandmother, Eliza Ward, partly of Irish Gypsy descent, who ran a second-hand shop during the second world war. Norma’s parents, Florence and Charles, died when she was very young and she spent much of her childhood looking after her younger brother Mike and sister Elaine, better known as Lal. It was a time, Norma said, when “most people had a piano in the parlour. We didn’t have a telly but my grandma knew all the music hall songs and we listened to pop music on Radio Luxembourg”. The children sang together around the house, and formed a group, the Mariners, during the trad jazz and skiffle era of the 1950s. From American folk, they became increasingly interested in the English tradition. They started a folk club in a Hull pub, the Blue Bell, and changed their name to the Watersons. The group consisted of Norma, Mike and Lal, and their second cousin John Harrison, and they transformed the 60s folk revival in Britain partly because they dressed like any other fashion-conscious young musicians of the time (they were nicknamed the “folk Beatles”), but mostly because of their attacking, unaccompanied harmony treatment of ancient English songs. As Mike commented at the time “we’re earthy, like the Rolling Stones”. He and Norma handled most of the lead vocals, with Lal providing often highly adventurous harmonies – this was a group that followed no traditional rules. As Norma explained: “If you couldn’t find a note, you sang a harmony.” The Watersons’ first album, Frost and Fire (1965), was followed by The Watersons and A Yorkshire Garland. The group were widely praised but split up in 1968, exhausted from touring. Norma’s first marriage (in 1958), to Eddie Anderson, had also ended, and now she spent time away from her brother and sister, moving to Montserrat in the West Indies, where she worked as a DJ. When she returned in 1972, she married Carthy, who joined the reformed Watersons, taking the place of Harrison. The new line-up recorded three albums, For Pence and Spicy Ale (1975), Sound, Sound Your Instruments of Joy (1977) and Green Fields (1981). In 1977 Norma also recorded the album A True Hearted Girl with Lal. In 1976, all three siblings and their families moved to Kirk Moor, a group of isolated farming cottages on the edge of the North York Moors. It is an exquisite, remote location, reached down a narrow lane that can be snowbound in winter, and was known to local villagers as “the hippy commune”. The arrangement ended in the late 80s when Norma and Lal and their families moved to Robin Hood’s Bay. Lal left the Watersons in 1990, but Norma kept working in a new group, Waterson:Carthy, in which she was joined by her husband and daughter. This group differed from the Watersons because it made use of instrumental backing, with Martin Carthy demonstrating his celebrated guitar work and Eliza playing the fiddle. Waterson:Carthy recorded six albums, first as a trio (on Waterson:Carthy, 1994 and Common Tongue, 1997), then with Saul Rose joining them on melodeon (Broken Ground, 1999), and later with Tim van Eyken taking his place (A Dark Light, 2002, Fishes and Fine Yellow Sand, 2004 and Holy Heathens and the Old Green Man, 2006). They concentrated on English traditional songs, but also included material from the Bahamas, the US, or a song by Mike. Norma was also part of the occasional folk harmony “super-group” Blue Murder. On their 2002 album, No One Stands Alone, she was joined by Martin and Eliza, Mike and the vocal trio Barry Coope, Jim Boyes and Lester Simpson, for a set that included a rousing treatment of Mike’s Rubber Band. Norma was one of the finest exponents of English traditional songs, but displayed her love of other styles in her eclectic and soulful solo albums. Norma Waterson (1996) included songs by Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter of the Grateful Dead, Elvis Costello, Richard Thompson and Lal, as well as the self-composed Hard Times Heart. The album was nominated for a Mercury prize, an award usually associated with pop and rock rather than folk, and very nearly won – the prize went instead to Pulp’s Different Class. Three years later, she expanded her range with The Very Thought of You, which included an emotional (but never sentimental) reworking of Over the Rainbow, and Love of My Life, by Freddie Mercury – along with the first recording of Lal’s angry Reply to Joe Haines, written after Harold Wilson’s former press secretary had written what Lal thought to be a deeply offensive article about Mercury’s death from Aids. In 2000, Norma recorded her first solo album of traditional songs, Bright Shiny Morning. With the album Gift, and the subsequent tour, she brought all these different musical influences together. She had suffered from a series of health problems, and had difficulty in walking, but was still in magnificent voice and handled the majority of the solos during the tour. At the BBC folk awards in 2011, Gift was named album of the year, and the song Poor Wayfaring Stranger, taken from the album, best traditional track. In 2016 she received a BBC folk awards lifetime achievement award. She was made MBE in 2002. Her last London concert, at which she appeared alongside Eliza at the Union Chapel, in 2010, was recorded and released as The Gift Band – Live on Tour album. It provided a triumphant and suitably emotional summary of her career. She told her audience that “it’s hard to stick to just one kind of music”, before joining her daughter for a set that included folk songs, contemporary songs by Thompson, the slow and emotional Dreaming, written for her by Loudon Wainwright, along with the gloriously tuneful Bunch of Thyme, a song about mortality, and songs she had learned in her childhood. Between songs, she chatted to the audience in the same easy-going and humorous way that she chatted to those who visited her home. Lal died in 1998; and Mike in 2011. Norma is survived by Martin and Eliza; and by Tim, her son from her first marriage.

1/31/2022,"Norway has halted a major hunt of wolves after campaigners secured a court injunction. Twenty-five animals, within four packs, are in the “wolf zone”, an area of nature set aside to protect the predators, and these have been given a stay of execution by the courts after campaigners argued wolves in a conservation area should not be shot.  At the start of this month, 51 wolves were due to be slaughtered after pressure from the hunting and farming lobbies in the country – a significant proportion of the 80 animals thought to live in Norway. “The wolves are saved for this year, as the hunting season only goes on for two more weeks and then it is the breeding season, when they cannot be shot,” Siri Martinsen, the chief executive of the animal rights organisation Noah, told the Guardian. The Guardian reported in January that conservation groups across Europe were appealing to the EU to take action against wolf population culls in Norway, Sweden and Finland, arguing that the Nordic nations were creating the most hostile environment for wolves in western Europe and flouting laws that protect the species. On Friday, Finland also suspended licences to kill three packs of wolves, citing EU legislation. The wolf is on Norway’s “red list” of endangered animals, so the government has set up a “wolf zone” – comprising 5% of Norway’s territory – where the animals are free to roam without being persecuted. Three environmental organisations – Noah, WWF Norway and Association Our Predators – argued that killing the 25 wolves in the conservation zone would be a breach of European environment law, and secured an injunction until this could be debated. A similar issue cropped up in 2020, when Noah took the government to court for its decision to hunt a wolf family inside the wolf zone. Last summer the court delivered its judgment and concluded that the decision was in breach of the Nature Diversity Act, ruling that the government did not manage to show sufficient grounds to make an exception from the strict protection of the wolf. The judgment has been appealed by the government and the appeal hearing is scheduled for summer 2022. Martinsen said the government was hostile towards wolves – the leading Labour party last year formed a coalition with the Centre party, which has a policy to remove all wolves from the country. “They don’t want wolves in Norway, they have always been clear that wolves should not be breeding in nature,” Martinsen said. Other European countries have introduced anti-wolf policies. Hunters in Sweden have already shot dead most of their annual target of 27 wolves. In Germany, where wolves crossed over from Denmark in 2017, there has been a debate over the predator’s impact on agriculture, and in the UK there are fierce arguments over whether they should ever be reintroduced.",News/World news,Norway’s wolves ‘saved for this year’ as animal rights groups fight cull,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/norway-wolves-saved-for-this-year-as-animal-rights-groups-fight-cull
1/31/2022,"In 2016, Portugal’s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, issued a lighthearted rebuke to his prime minister: António Costa, the president noted, was prone to “a chronic and slightly irritating optimism”. Almost six years on, Costa’s optimism appears fairly well founded. On Sunday night the 60-year-old leader of Portugal’s Socialist party (PS) defied the polls, as well as political trends elsewhere in Europe, to secure a surprise outright majority in a snap general election.  The PS had won an absolute majority only once before, and there have now been just four such majorities achieved by any party in the past 35 years. Expectations are likely to be high as the Socialists prepare to return to office to administer €45bn of EU Covid recovery funds. Costa, who has been prime minister since 2015, has been praised for overseeing an economic turnaround, reversing bitterly unpopular austerity measures and managing one of the most successful vaccination programmes in Europe. He has also shown himself able to navigate tricky political waters. Few imagined that his geringonça (improvised solution) with the Socialists’ erstwhile allies in the Portuguese Communist party and the Left Bloc would last a year, let alone six. Costa’s absolute majority now frees him from having to rely on the Communists and the Left Bloc, whose opposition to the 2022 budget triggered the early election. Parts of the leftwing electorate appear to have voted strategically, backing the Socialists as they had the best chance of winning and punishing the smaller parties they blame for bringing the last legislature to a premature end. The centre-right Social Democrats (PSD), who finished second, were ahead in some polls last week but may have been scorned by centrists voters who were uncomfortable at the prospect of a PSD minority government having to strike deals with the far-right Chega party. The Socialists have said they could increase the minimum wage in western Europe’s poorest country from €705 (£582) a month to €900 by 2026, and plan to spend most of the EU funds on updating Portugal’s infrastructure. The PSD, meanwhile, had promised to cut taxes on corporate profits and personal income. If the polls were wide of the mark when it came to the winners – the consensus was that it would be a close race between the Socialists and the PSD, with neither winning an outright majority – they were not wrong on Chega. And if Sunday was a monumental night for Costa and his party, it was also one for the former football pundit André Ventura and his far-right grouping. Chega won 12 seats, up from just one in the 2019 election, to become the third-largest party in the 230-seat parliament. Its share of the vote rose from 1.9% three years ago to 7.2%, meaning that more and more Portuguese voters are heeding Ventura’s populist, anti-Roma discourse. Chega’s rise echoes the arrival of the far-right Vox party in Spain’s parliament three years ago. Spain and Portugal – long fondly imagined to be immune to the far right because of their relatively recent experiences of the Franco and Salazar dictatorships – have each now proved themselves insufficiently vaccinated. Among those offering their congratulations to Ventura were Vox’s leader, Santiago Abascal, and Marine Le Pen. The latter hailed Chega’s victory as further proof that “throughout Europe, people are rising up to reclaim their freedom and their sovereignty”. Costa, whose natural optimism has now been buoyed by an unexpected electoral triumph, has acknowledged the scale of his new mandate and promised not to abuse it as he seeks to bring together a fragmented country and help lead its social and economic recovery from the pandemic. “An absolute majority doesn’t mean absolute power; it doesn’t mean governing alone,” he said on Sunday night. “It’s an increased responsibility and it means governing with and for all Portuguese.”",News/World news,Hopes will be high for Portugal’s optimism-prone PM after big win,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/hopes-high-portugal-optimism-prone-pm-antonio-costa-election-win
1/31/2022,"Thousands of NHS cancer patients who have exhausted all other options are being offered liquid biopsy blood tests to match them to personalised medicines. The groundbreaking genetic analysis gives patients a better chance of successfully trying new treatments. A pioneering scheme piloted at the Christie NHS foundation trust in Manchester proved so successful it is being rolled out across the UK, the Guardian can reveal.  The development is a significant breakthrough. Cancer patients who have run out of options but are still reasonably well have been able to access clinical trials based on their cancer type – breast cancer, for example – for decades. However, many of these trials do not target the DNA profile of the patient’s tumour. Now cancer patients running out of options are being offered personalised drugs via the nationwide initiative. By understanding the genetic faults in a patient’s cancer from a simple blood test, doctors can match more patients to specific clinical trials – with the hope of saving or extending lives. The Target National initiative is being funded by the Christie charity and the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation in Newcastle. It is recruiting thousands of cancer patients via 18 cancer centres in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The new approach is essentially a match-making service for patients and clinical trials. The quicker patients can try new drugs that may help them, the better chance of life-changing results. The pilot found patients accessing new drugs this way were more likely to see their tumours shrink. The results also suggested that a wider pool of patients and clinical trials would further increase the chances of success. “The learnings from our original Target study in Manchester were that genetic testing needs to be done on a large scale to identify rare genetic mutations and that broader access to medicines through clinical trials being undertaken across the country rather than just one site are required,” said Dr Matthew Krebs, a consultant oncologist at the Christie who is leading Target National. “This study will allow thousands of cancer patients in the UK to access genetic testing via a liquid biopsy. This will enable us to identify rare genetic mutations that in some patients could mean access to life-changing experimental medicines that can provide great treatment responses, where there are otherwise limited or no other treatment options available.” The scheme is open to cancer patients with solid tumours who have exhausted all other options and are considered by their oncologists to be suitable for early-phase experimental trials. Researchers analyse the genetic characteristics of a patient’s cancer from a blood sample and look for faulty genes that may inform that individual’s suitability to receive an experimental treatment. David Kearney was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer in February 2016 but access to clinical trials through the pilot scheme has kept him alive. “Taking part in the Target trial helped me by enabling my doctors find the right clinical trials for me,” the 58-year-old father of two from Bury said. In 2021, he celebrated his 25th wedding anniversary with his wife, Amanda, and became a grandfather for the first time. “I have now been on clinical trials for nearly two years, which has kept my cancer at bay, and I really hope many more people from across the UK will experience the same success.” The new initiative uses a state-of-the art blood test made by Roche that spots genetic faults in the cancer. Because tiny amounts of DNA leak from tumours into the blood stream, a simple blood sample is all that is needed to find the tumour’s genetic code. “We can’t guarantee that we will find a fault in the genetic code of every cancer patient we recruit, or that if we do, there will be a suitable drug trial for them,” said Krebs. “However, as we learn more about the genetics of cancer in this study, it will help doctors and scientists develop new treatments to help people in the future. “Ultimately, we hope liquid biopsy testing will be adopted into routine NHS care but we need studies such as this to show the benefit of the test on a large scale and provide the evidence that patients can benefit from being matched to targeted medicines on the basis of the blood test.”",News/Society,NHS cancer patients to get pioneering genetic test to find best treatments,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/31/nhs-cancer-patients-to-get-pioneering-genetic-test-to-find-best-treatments
1/31/2022,"Frank Lampard has said is “very hungry to get started” after being confirmed as Everton’s manager on a contract to 2024 and has told his players that he expects “fight and desire” at all times. The 43-year-old accepted the chance to succeed Rafael Benítez and agreed terms on the deal at chairman Bill Kenwright’s office in London on Sunday. He met his new squad for the first time on their return to training at Finch Farm on Monday, where Donny van de Beek was also present before his anticipated loan from Manchester United.  Lampard is joined by a backroom team comprising the former Chelsea coach Joe Edwards as assistant manager, Paul Clement as first-team coach and Chris Jones as first-team coach and head of performance. The former Derby and Chelsea manager had also wanted Antony Barry to join him but the coach opted to remain at Stamford Bridge. Duncan Ferguson and the goalkeeping coach Alan Kelly will remain part of Everton’s coaching staff at the request of Lampard, who is understood to have offered a position to Ashley Cole. The manager takes over a struggling team only four points above the relegation zone having won once in 14 Premier League games. His first match will be at home to Brentford in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday. Lampard said: “It is a huge honour for me to represent and manage a club the size and tradition of Everton Football Club. I’m very hungry to get started. After speaking to the owner, chairman and the board, I very much felt their passion and ambition. I hope they felt my ambition and how hard I want to work to bring it together. “You can feel the passion Everton fans have for their club. That will be hugely important. As a team – the competitive level that the Premier League brings and the position we are in the table – we certainly need that. It’s a two-way thing. I think Everton is a unique club in that you can really understand what the fans want to see. The first thing they want is fight and desire and that must always be our baseline. My first message to the players will be that we have to do this together. We’ll try to do our job and I know the fans will be there backing us.” Lampard was chosen after a complicated two-week managerial search that involved an initial approach for the club’s former manager Roberto Martínez and fan protests over the potential appointment of Vítor Pereira. The Portuguese coach, Lampard and Ferguson were interviewed by Everton’s majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, and the club’s board on Friday. Moshiri said: “I am really delighted that Frank has joined us. He is an impressive young man and off the pitch. He has played at the very highest level of the game and has football in his blood. He impressed us all greatly during the thorough interview process and we’re all ready to give him all of our support as he looks to give the team an immediate boost.” Kenwright added: “Frank impressed us greatly throughout our process, coming across as a modern, ambitious and exciting young manager. He expressed a clear vision on how he wants to take the club forward and, importantly, a tremendous passion and genuine enthusiasm to join us. I’m sure Evertonians will give him the special welcome that only they can.” The arrival of Lampard and his backroom team, plus the move for Van de Beek, marks a hectic end to the transfer window for Everton and the Netherlands midfielder may not be the only incoming deadline-day deal. The Real Madrid striker Luka Jovic has been linked with a loan and the club are continuing to explore other midfield options.",Sport/Football,‘Hungry to get started’: Frank Lampard confirmed as Everton manager,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/31/frank-lampard-confirmed-as-everton-manager-hungry-to-get-started
1/31/2022,"The names of Boris Johnson’s aides interviewed by detectives investigating parties in Downing Street may not be released because of police policy, even if they are being treated as suspects or issued with fines for breaking the lockdown rules they helped make. Sue Gray’s report contains minimal details of the parties the Met is investigating, which are among the most serious breaches and most politically controversial.  The Met asked Gray to leave out all but bare details of the parties police are looking at, triggering huge anger at the force. The policy of the Metropolitan police on naming those who form part of its criminal investigations follows the guidance from the College of Policing, which sets standards for law enforcement in England and Wales. The policy is to usually name people only when they are charged or summonsed for an offence and a criminal investigation has progressed to the stage where guilt or innocence will be determined by a court. There are limited, ill-defined exceptions. Thus those interviewed as witnesses, or suspects, are not usually named. Furthermore the Met has not been naming people issued with fines for breaking coronavirus rules, and in some cases has issued anonymised details. A Met spokesperson said: “We follow the College of Policing guidelines. Those guidelines say police will only name people when they are charged, unless there are extenuating circumstances.” Nothing would stop Johnson or his press aides from themselves choosing to make public the names of those interviewed under caution or punishment such as a fine. The last time a criminal investigation centred on Downing Street, when the Met investigated Tony Blair’s government for allegedly handing out peerages for donations, the former Labour prime minister was interviewed by detectives three times. Then the Met did not name the PM as being interviewed as a witness, though political sources did. Cash for peerages, as the inquiry was dubbed, collapsed in 2007 with no charges. Blair’s aides beat back a police wish to interview him as a potential suspect under caution warning he would feel obliged to resign. As yet the Met will not say which parties are under investigation. The clampdown came after the 2012 Leveson report following concerns about police and media relations triggered by the phone-hacking scandal. Rules on what information could be released by police about those who were subject to investigation came under further scrutiny after the VIP paedophile scandal, where the Met fell for the lies of a fantasist and pursued establishment figures over baseless claims. Andy Trotter, the former media lead for chief constables until his retirement in 2014, said: “The exemptions were for a policing purpose, such as for the safety of victims or to get further information from the public about a crime.” Guidelines from the College of Policing about naming those under police investigation state: “Suspects should not be identified to the media (by disclosing names or other identifying information) prior to the point of charge except where justified by clear circumstances eg a threat to life, the prevention or detection of crime or a matter of public interest and confidence.” Trotter said that when new police media rules were being drafted after the Leveson report, there was discussion among chiefs about whether there should be an exemption if “the [Met] commissioner or prime minister was arrested”. But the issue was never resolved, other than to agree that a senior officer could decide whether the policy should be waived. That argument for any potential exemption may be weaker for “partygate” because breaches of pandemic rules are punishable only by fixed-penalty notices, which are low level, akin to a fine for a driving offence.",News/Politics,Names of people interviewed in parties inquiry may not be released ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/names-of-people-interviewed-in-parties-inquiry-may-not-be-released
