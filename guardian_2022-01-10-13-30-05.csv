1/10/2022,"The Power of the Dog and Succession were the big winners at an unusual, stripped-back Golden Globes. Traditionally, the ceremony is a glitzy telecast with A-listers in attendance but after a year of controversies surrounding diversity and amoral practices, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association lost its footing in the industry, with publicity firms, studios and celebrities choosing to distance themselves.  Sunday night’s event took place at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles, with no stars or audience, and just select members and grantees. Results were announced via social media. The acclaimed Netflix drama The Power of the Dog was named best picture – drama, while Jane Campion became the third woman to win best director. Kodi Smit-McPhee also won best supporting actor for his performance in the film. Will Smith was named best actor in a drama for King Richard, while Nicole Kidman won best actress in a drama for playing Lucille Ball in Being the Ricardos. It was Kidman’s fourth win from 16 nominations. Steven Spielberg’s acclaimed remake West Side Story dominated the musical/comedy categories, winning best picture, best actress for Rachel Zegler and best supporting actress for Ariana DeBose. Andrew Garfield was also named best actor in a musical or comedy for Tick, Tick … Boom!. On the television side, HBO’s hit drama Succession picked up awards for best drama, best actor for Jeremy Strong and best supporting actress for Sarah Snook. The network also saw freshman series Hacks named best comedy and its star Jean Smart win for best actress in a comedy series. Jason Sudeikis was named best comedy actor for Ted Lasso, while O Yeong-Su won best supporting actor for Netflix’s breakout hit Squid Game. MJ Rodriguez became the first trans woman to win the award for best actress in a drama series for Pose. Kate Winslet was named best actress in a limited series for the acclaimed crime drama Mare of Easttown while Michael Keaton was named best actor in a limited series for Hulu’s opioid drama Dopesick. Barry Jenkins’ period drama The Underground Railroad also won for best limited series. Other winners included Japan’s Drive My Car as best film not in the English language, Encanto for best animated feature, Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast for best screenplay, No Time to Die for best original song and Dune for best original score. Staff members representing various non-profits supported by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association were on hand to announce winners. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis appeared via video to talk about the HFPA’s philanthropic efforts. “I am proud to be associated with them in this venture,” Curtis said, while Schwarzenegger praised the organisation’s support of diverse voices. The event required proof of vaccination and a negative PCR test. Attendees were also required to be masked and socially distanced at all times. After a series of Los Angeles Times exposés revealing a lack of diversity in the HFPA’s voting membership and a number of “ethical lapses”, the past 12 months have seen high-profile actors including Tom Cruise and Scarlett Johansson speak out against the association, as well as NBC deciding not to broadcast this year’s ceremony. Attempted repair work has included “overhauling” previously restrictive bylaws, implementing changes with regards to code of conduct and ethical practices, and bringing in a diverse set of 21 new members. “Last year the Hollywood Foreign Press Association was challenged to change – and we did,” said Helen Hoehne, its president. “Both internally, within the Association, as well as adding 21 members to bring fresh perspectives. “We are on a journey of change and we’re not going to rest. We are going to be outspoken about what we’re learning and challenge others to join us.” Kyle Bowser, senior vice-president of the NAACP Hollywood Bureau, spoke of a joint five-year initiative to increase diversity, equity and inclusion. “Imagination is the currency that sustains and propels the entertainment industries,” he said during the ceremony. Last year’s televised ceremony suffered a catastrophic 60% drop in viewers. Sunday’s Critics Choice awards had been expected to act as an unofficial replacement, with celebrities in attendance and a televised ceremony, but the event was postponed as a result of an increase in Covid-19 cases. This year’s Oscar nominations are due to be announced on 8 February, with the ceremony taking place on 27 March.",Arts/Film,Golden Globes: The Power of the Dog and Succession win at celebrity-free ceremony,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/10/golden-globes-the-power-of-the-dog-and-succession-win-at-celebrity-free-ceremony
1/10/2022,"The judge hearing Novak Djokovic’s case has queried “what more” he could have done to prove his medical exemption and criticised the Australian government for reneging on a deal to give him more time to defend his visa from cancellation. Judge Anthony Kelly said he was “preoccupied” and “somewhat agitated” by the issue of why Australian officials did not accept an exemption document provided by the world No 1 male tennis player from a qualified physician, backed up by an independent Victorian government panel.  The federal circuit court began to hear Djokovic’s case on Monday morning, allowing him temporarily out of detention to view the hearing away from the Park hotel in Melbourne, where he is being held. The expedited hearing comes ahead of a looming Tennis Australia deadline of Tuesday for Djokovic to be included in the draw to play the Australian Open. Djokovic is seeking to win a record 10th Australian Open which would be his 21st open grand slam title, the most ever for a male player in singles. He now finds his fortune at the whims of Australian administrative law which advocates have long complained is stacked against those seeking to regain visas, including the refugees held at the Park hotel, in detention for up to nine years. Djokovic arrived in Australia late on Wednesday evening before his visa was cancelled at 7.29am on Thursday morning on the basis he may be a threat to health and safety because he was unvaccinated. Djokovic’s counsel, Nicholas Wood, told the court the Serbian tennis star had done his “level best” to provide everything to substantiate his exemption that he recently had Covid-19, including uploading a medical exemption from the chief medical officer of Tennis Australia before travelling. Kelly interrupted to comment that the status of Djokovic’s medical exemption “preoccupied” him, describing it as a “relatively significant fact” that Djokovic had obtained an exemption from “a professor and eminently qualified physician”, which was further approved by an independent expert panel established by the Victorian state government. “That document was in the hands of the delegate [who cancelled his visa]. The point I’m somewhat agitated about is: what more could this man [Djokovic] have done?” Wood said that Djokovic had been “utterly confused” when interviewed on Thursday morning, pointing to a note he received before travelling from the home affairs department that his claim for an exemption had been assessed and accepted. The department argues that response does not amount to an assurance his medical exemption would allow him to enter Australia. Kelly noted Djokovic was “effectively incommunicado” from 4am when he was asked to switch his phone off until 7.42am when he was told of the cancellation, as the department reneged on an agreement to give him until 8.30am to consult Tennis Australia. The Australian government has argued visa-holders cannot be allowed to “filibuster” by refusing to completely respond to a notice to cancel a visa. Wood submitted that Djokovic had wanted to wait for a particular time to speak to Tennis Australia and the judge appeared to accept he had done so to “effectively take up the opportunity … to provide [authorities] anything further [they] might want”. Kelly noted that Djokovic was urged not to get in touch with his lawyers, which Wood said occurred on the “spurious rationale” it would be in his interests to complete his interview without them. In its written submission the Australian government argued that any failure to consider further representations from Djokovic is immaterial. Wood labelled that view “erroneous” unless the delegate had a closed mind about the case. Kelly suggested on one view the interview could be seen as an ex-post-facto justification for the cancellation decision. The Australian government submitted that recent infection with Covid-19 by itself is not enough for a medical exemption, and the evidence established that Djokovic “has recovered” and is therefore not entitled to one. Through counsel, Christopher Tran, it submitted that Djokovic had given a response to the notice to cancel the visa in the interview and there was no denial of procedural fairness. Tran said Djokovic may have felt “pressured” to respond, but urged the judge not to find that was Border Force officials’ intention. The hearing continues on Monday afternoon, with further submissions from Tran. The morning’s remote hearing suffered technical outages in webcasting that triggered adjournments or closed it from public view. Earlier on Monday, Wood accused the delegate of the home affairs minister of a “paucity of evidence” for the decision to cancel Djokovic’s visa, and warned that any defect in reasoning should see it reinstated. Legal experts have warned even after the expedited hearing, there is no guarantee Djokovic could secure a court order restoring his visa in time to play, and he could also face his visa being revoked again. In written submissions the home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, has asked the court, if it sides with Djokovic, to quash the original decision but not to order his release. The government submitted it had the power to make a fresh cancellation decision and noted “other powers” including re-detention. Wood sought an interlocutory injunction to release Djokovic pending the result of the case. Kelly noted on Thursday Tran had ruled out deporting Djokovic before the result.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic: judge ‘agitated’ by issue of why Australian government did not accept tennis player’s medical exemption ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/10/novak-djokovic-judge-agitated-by-issue-of-why-australian-government-did-not-accept-tennis-players-medical-exemption
1/10/2022,"Rescuers are still searching for a 14-year-old girl reported missing in Queensland flood waters, as the state emergency service begins the lengthy process of assessing hundreds of homes and businesses for damage. Flood waters on the Fraser Coast town of Maryborough, 250km north of Brisbane, peaked at 9.96 metres on Sunday night – below the level of the devastating 2013 flood.  The city centre was protected by a levee until 2am when an underground stormwater mechanism failed, allowing flood waters to surge up through the drains. Local police superintendent Michael Sawrey said it would take several days for the waters to fully recede. More than 1,000 people have been isolated by the floods, which followed ex-tropical cyclone Seth dumping 600mm of rain on the Wide Bay-Burnett region in two days. Sawrey said the number of people isolated gave an indication of the number of homes affected, but the exact number of those damaged would not be known until emergency services move in and conduct rapid assessments of homes and businesses. “The clean-up will take a while, as you would have seen,” he said. “The water was slow rising, and with that, it’s normally slow getting away. But … you can see from last night even how much water has gone down. So that’s a positive thing for Maryborough.” Sawrey said water police and police divers were continuing to look for the girl, who was swept away in flood waters at Booubyjan, near Gympie, on Saturday. “Unfortunately at this stage, we haven’t found the missing 14-year-old girl and we have grave concerns for her, but we’re putting in whatever efforts we can to try to locate her,” he told reporters on Monday. “It is an extremely difficult area surrounded by water, which has created hindrances to our search effort.” The prime minister, Scott Morrison, speaking in Canberra, said his thoughts were with the 14-year-old girl’s family. “I have a daughter who’s 14 years old, so I can understand the terrible, terrible time that family must be going through at the moment,” he said. He also gave his condolences to the family of a 22-year-old man, who was found dead in flood waters near Gympie on Saturday. A father and daughter who survived two nights clinging to a tree near Gympie were airlifted to safety by a rescue helicopter on Sunday afternoon. “The father explained to the crew that his car had been caught between two sections of floodwaters on Friday night and water began filling the car,” RACQ LifeFlight said in a statement late on Sunday night. “He and his primary school-aged daughter climbed on to the roof of the vehicle but were swept into the water in the darkness.” The father then swam to his car, grabbed a rope, and used it to tie himself and his daughter to the tree. When the waters subsided on Sunday they climbed the 10 metres down to the ground and raised the alarm at a nearby homestead. State disaster coordinator Steve Gollschewski said the father and daughter’s rescue gave crews hope for the missing teenager. “While we have very grave concerns, we are hopeful … we saw yesterday a pair of people come out after an extended period in a tree,” he said. “They were able to be supported when they came out after what was probably a pretty terrible experience for them, but they are safe.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning No others have been reported missing as a result of the flood. The Bureau of Meteorology said the flooding would move farther upstream as waters washed out toward Fraser Island. Falls of between 50 to 700mm were recorded north and north-west of Gympie over the weekend. Financial support via the disaster recovery payment will be available for people in the Bundaberg, Gympie and Fraser Coast regions from Tuesday.",News/Australia news,‘Grave concerns’ for 14-year-old girl missing in Queensland flood waters as search continues,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/10/grave-concerns-for-14-year-old-girl-missing-in-queensland-flood-waters-as-search-continues
1/10/2022,"Close contacts of Covid cases employed in critical supply chains will have their isolation requirements scrapped, in an attempt to address workforce shortages that have hit the food industry. Announcing a shake-up of isolation requirements on Monday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the requirements would not apply to customer-facing roles, but those working in “critical supply chains”.  All states and territories, except WA, are expected to sign off on the changes on Monday, with NSW and Queensland already announcing similar changes over the weekend. “Those who are driving the truck to deliver the food, those who are stacking the shelves at night, those who are in the distribution centres, those who are in the abattoirs, those who are in the manufacturing places that are producing food,” Morrison said. The changes will bring the food distribution industry and emergency services in line with requirements that already apply in some states’ health and aged care sectors. Anyone who tests positive or who is symptomatic will not return to work. The prime minister said national cabinet would assess extending the relaxed isolation requirements to other sectors, including aviation and potentially hospitality, but the disruptions to food supply chains and emergency services needed to be acted upon “immediately”, ahead of a meeting of national cabinet on Thursday. He also said the country now had no choice but to “push through” the Omicron wave, saying the alternative was a return to lockdowns. “I mean, you can just shut everything down and lock everybody away, and there will be no food on the shelves, and there’ll be no children getting taught, and there’ll be no one providing health care. “So that’s obviously not a practical way to move forward. And so what we have done as a government has always sought to balance the various demands and pressures on the system with the health imperative.” The new isolation changes were agreed to by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, which is comprised of state and territory chief health officers and the chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly. Kelly said that discussions with Coles and Woolworths on Sunday had indicated that absenteeism was running at between 30 and 50%, and the supermarkets “could not operate in those sort of circumstances”. “So that’s the sort of issues we’re dealing with and we need to move fast to take these risk based approaches,” Kelly said. “This is a reasonable step in relation to the increased transmissibility of the Omicron variant and the expected high number of incident cases in the community, and with the majority of those … mild illness,” Kelly said. “The provision to allow greater flexibility in balancing the need to reduce transmission against the detrimental loss of workforce is an appropriate measure.” In relation to the pressures being felt by the hospitality sector and other businesses, Morrison said the government would make changes “one step at a time”. “As the case numbers continue to rise the volume of cases will of course have an inevitable impact on the workforce, and so we are looking to maximise those people who remain in the workforce.” The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet said the government was focused on the issues in food supply chains, but he was aware of similar concerns in the hospitality sector that would also be considered. “We will work with our health teams in relation to that, but we need to prioritise here and ultimately our number one responsibility is to keep people safe. “But as we move through this period I would expect further adjustments will get made as we have from time to time … obviously we have been in contact with the hospitality industry and completely understand their concerns.” With the peak of the Omicron wave still several weeks away, Morrison also said he was confident that all states would resume face-to-face learning in term one, and was hopeful that states and territories would “harmonise their back-to-school plans”. “Our objective is go back, stay back, day one, term one,” Morrison said. “The idea is once we go back, we stay back, and we get certainty around that issue, and so we’ll be working through those issues this week and to get further certainty and harmonisation between the states and territories. “It’s obviously a key issue for parents as they think about their children going back to school in a few weeks’ time.” The secretary of the department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Phil Gaetjens, is working with the states to develop a consistent approach, despite Queensland already indicating it will delay the start of the school year until 7 February for most students. Kelly said that the discussion about children and Covid was “difficult”, but he emphasised that the vast majority of cases in young people were mild. “It’s related to balancing the wider aspects and the importance of face-to-face learning in schools with the risk of Covid,” Kelly said. “There are many other reasons why children should be in school … in the widest terms, including mental health, developmental health, physical health outside of Covid. So these are tricky things to talk through, but we are talking through them.” On Monday, the vaccine rollout for children aged five to 11 also commenced, with the head of the government’s vaccine taskforce, Lt Gen John Frewen, insisting that appointments and supplies were available, despite reports of parents struggling to access the jabs. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He said there would be 2m doses available by 21 January, with 8,000 places participating in the paediatric vaccine program. “The message again is there has been very strong take up on bookings and I do commend parents for their determination and willingness to bring their kids forward to get vaccinated,” Frewen said. “If there have been frustrations around getting appointments for some, then please if you can’t get an immediate appointment with your primary healthcare provider if that is your GP, then please do try the pharmacies, please do try the state hubs. “There are additional bookings coming online every day and there will be more and more opportunities over the weeks ahead.” Australia’s booster program is also under way, with about 250,000 shots being given on a daily basis.",News/World news,Covid isolation rules scrapped for critical workers to protect food supply chain,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/covid-isolation-rules-scrapped-for-critical-workers-to-protect-food-supply-chain
