2/18/2022,"Eddie Howe has admitted he cannot be certain that Kieran Trippier will play again this season after the England right-back underwent surgery on a broken bone in a foot on Thursday. Trippier has excelled in a Newcastle shirt since arriving from Atlético Madrid for £12m early last month and his manager described the absence as “a big blow” to the team’s struggle against relegation.  “The operation went well, which was good news, but I don’t know how long he’s going to be out,” said Howe. “We hope to have him back before the end of the season but it’s obviously a significant injury which is a blow to us because he was performing so well. We’re going to have to see how his early rehab goes. “Sadly, we’re going to miss his leadership skills on the pitch and everything that he was delivering for us. Kieran’s scored two goals in the last two games [the wins against Everton and Aston Villa] which have been defining moments for us but we’re confident we have enough quality in the squad to cover for his absence.” Whereas some injured players prefer to separate themselves from teammates while they recover, Howe is confident Trippier will continue to prove a galvanising presence in the dressing room. “The players here find Kieran an inspirational figure and that won’t change,” he said. “He won’t be on the pitch but he will still be around them at the training ground.” Howe has remained close to Trippier since signing him for Burnley earlier in his career and is impressed by the defender’s maturation in recent years. “I can’t compliment Kieran enough on everything he’s achieved,” he said. “Having known the young Kieran I realise he’s changed and developed many facets of his personality.” A run of three straight wins before Saturday’s lunchtime visit to West Ham has lifted Newcastle one place and four points clear of the bottom three but, with their Friday afternoon flight to London in danger of cancellation because of Storm Eunice, Howe said he and his players were contemplating making the near 300-mile journey by road.",Sport/Football,"Kieran Trippier could miss rest of Newcastle’s season, admits Eddie Howe",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/18/newcastle-kieran-trippier-could-miss-rest-of-season-eddie-howe
2/18/2022,"A teenager has denied the murder of 12-year-old Ava White but admitted possessing a knife. The schoolgirl was fatally stabbed in the neck after a Christmas lights switch-on in Liverpool city centre on 25 November.  A 14-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared via video link at Liverpool crown court on Friday charged with her murder. He admitted possessing an offensive weapon, a knife, in Church Alley, Liverpool, on 25 November. About a dozen members of Ava’s family were in court for the hearing, which lasted about half an hour, and some were in tears as the teenager entered his pleas. The judge, Mrs Justice Yip, told the defendant: “Your trial is going to take place in May, starting 9 May.” The case is expected to last three weeks. Ava, who has been described as “popular” and “bright”, was assaulted in the city centre just after 8.30pm. She was taken to Alder Hey Children’s hospital after paramedics arrived but died a short time later. After her death her father, Robert Martin, said the family was “completely devastated and heartbroken”. Hundreds of people attended a vigil held in her memory a week after her death. Family, friends and others gathered in Church Street, close to where the attack happened, to pay tribute to her. Hundreds of balloons, some in the shape of the letter A, were released at the start of the vigil. The Radio City tower was lit up blue in memory of the schoolgirl. Imagine by John Lennon was performed by Astrid Smith as hundreds held up glowsticks and phones to light up the city centre in Ava’s memory. Three other boys were also arrested in connection with Ava’s death. A Merseyside police spokesperson said a 16-year-old boy was released on bail, a 14-year-old was released under investigation and no further action was taken against a 13-year-old.",News/UK news,"Ava White: boy, 14, denies murder of 12-year-old in Liverpool",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/18/ava-white-boy-14-denies-murder-12-year-old-liverpool-fatal-stabbing
2/18/2022,"Thirty years ago percussionist Tim Williams formed a new-music group in Manchester. Williams has remained the artistic director of Psappha ever since, but later this year steps down from his role, so the group’s current tour is both a celebration of its 30th birthday and an extended farewell to its founder. The list of Psappha’s commissions from both established and fledgling composers over its history is prodigious and, characteristically, the programme it is touring also includes a brand new work. Like a number of Simon Holt’s recent pieces, The Sower, for alto flute, cello, piano and cimbalom, is inspired by the poetry of Antonio Machado, in this case by a text found on a bronze plaque in the Andalusian town of Baeza, where Machado taught French between 1912 and 1919.  Holt’s 20-minute single movement is threaded through with long solo lines for the flute and the cello, to which the other instruments add flurries of commentary or combine with them to create passages of machine-like insistence. The sound of the cimbalom sometimes blends into that of the piano but more often adds its own distinctive twang to the textures. It’s a piece that seems by turns elegiac and hopeful, full of the crisp, vivid instrumental detail that is so typical of Holt’s music. Williams and the pianist Benjamin Powell also took on The Axe Manual, Harrison Birtwistle’s 2001 workout for piano and a vast array of percussion, in which the two protagonists are either locked in musical combat or into manic toccatas. The technical challenges these confrontations throw up are immense but this was a performance of fabulous assurance. And between these substantial scores were two works that came out of Psappha’s scheme to foster composers at the starts of their careers: Joanna Ward’s Translucent, for a solo cellist (Jennifer Langridge), who has to hum, sing and shriek as well as play her instrument; and Ninfea Cruttwell-Reade’s Three Etudes for Piano and Flowerpots, in which the tuned ceramics produce sounds somewhere between a Javanese gamelan and John Cage’s prepared piano.

2/18/2022,"It is not suitable viewing for people with a fear of flying but a YouTube outlet that livestreams aircraft has become one of the unexpected hits of Storm Eunice. Big Jet TV has built up a steady audience over the last six years by livestreaming aircraft movements but its biggest audiences come during storms, when its cameras are set up on the perimeter of airports and broadcast for hours.  On Friday, the channel hit a record 200,000 concurrent live viewers for its stream of planes struggling to land in strong winds at Heathrow airport – more than usually watch many British rolling news television channels. The host often praises the pilots and ground teams for their hard work and expertise in landing the aircraft safely in difficult conditions, while viewers’ hearts must go out to those onboard. A significant part of Big Jet TV’s appeal is its founder and host, Jerry Dyer, who has built up a cult audience online for his unfiltered excitable commentary. Watching the channel is the transport equivalent of tuning into Sky Sports’ longrunning Soccer Saturday programme – except rather than having a retired footballer enthusiastically reporting a goal, viewers are treated to Dyer screeching with delight when a pilot pulls off a challenging landing. As one wobbling Air Algiers flight approached the Heathrow runway on Friday morning, Dyer shouted over the wind and made predictions about whether the aircraft would have to abandon its approach and make a “go-around”. “I think this guy’s gonna struggle. He’s all over the place. Here we go, here we go. Easy, easy. He’s down!” he cried. Occasionally, he lapsed into political commentary such as when welcoming an Aeroflot Boeing 777: “Next in from Moscow, let’s give a big warm welcome – or whichever side of the fence you’re on – to the Russians, ladies and gentlemen!” He told viewers that the storm was the ultimate test of pilots’ abilities: “They’ve been through all these scenarios in the simulators. British Airways train their pilots hard and they do try their best to simulate these conditions. But it’s like anything simulated: you’re all in a nice clean, stable environment and you can have a cup of coffee with you. “Inside that cockpit is massively intense. You’ve got the non-flying pilot reading out all the parameters, the altitude, the speed, all that kind of thing. You’ve got the pilot who’s trying to control the aircraft, manipulating the throttle, getting kicked around by the wind. When the winds are very intense you’re literally flying sideways … A big load of props has to go to these pilots and all the other people who are working in the industry as well.” Big Jet TV is a full-time operation for Dyer, supported by financial contributions from members who pay for access to extra streams. The two-person media business is supported by the director of operations, Gilly Prestwood, an early fan of Dyer’s streams who now provides technical support and keeps the broadcast on the road. While mainstream news outlets – which often use Big Jet TV’s clips – try to contextualise the storm and offer coverage from across the country, Dyer maintains his livestreaming for hours: “Oh, they’ve got a big one coming, oh it’s a freighter. Oh mate, I can hear that coming over the bushes. That was crazy, man.” Spotting an Air China cargo flight from Beijing coming in, he dubs it the “testkit express”, explaining that up to five planes a day have been flying in since the start of the pandemic delivering medical supplies to the UK. But he returns swiftly back to the main appeal of providing commentary on whether pilots can land their enormous planes in the most difficult conditions: “Fair play to this pilot, easy son, easy son. Go on, go, go, drop it, drop it, yeah, nicely done.”",News/UK news,Big Jet TV: livestreaming of planes landing during Storm Eunice goes viral,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/18/livestreaming-of-planes-landing-during-storm-eunice-goes-viral-bigjettv

2/18/2022,"Iam two mouthfuls into my avocado toast when I realise what it is about Nicôle Lecky, the actor, writer and singer-songwriter at the centre of BBC Three’s new musical drama Mood, that has her so tipped for stardom. She’s cool. Not just in the conventional, strong-looks-and-swagger way, or because her affable yet direct personality makes her uniquely easy to connect with (“Nobody is too old for Ibiza,” she offers when I share my latest holiday anxiety). But it’s in the forensic way she talks about her work, detailed but never dispassionate – the sign of an artist in full control of their vision. For Mood – based on Superhoe, her 2019 one-woman stage play – Lecky is very much in charge. She plays the lead. The script is hers. Many of the lyrics are hers (and usually sung by her, too). It’s executive produced by her, and nearly every character is one she has performed in the stage version. When we meet for breakfast in London, she’s on her way to the editing suite. “We started shooting in March. The cast and choreographer have all finished and moved on,” she says. “But I’m still here.”  Mood joins a stellar roster of television shows adapted from plays whose inspiration comes from their creator’s life: Michaela Coel’s Chewing Gum, Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag, Sophie Willan’s Alma’s Not Normal. It’s set in the diverse, working-class communities of east London where Lecky grew up. “But I always say [Mood] is more observational than autobiographical,” she says. Lecky plays Sasha, a 25-year-old mixed-race singer and rapper who is going nowhere. She can’t get over her ex, and spends most of her day smoking weed and scrolling through his Instagram. When her mum eventually throws her out, she has to find a way to fend for herself. She meets Carly, a glamorous influencer who promises to show her how to make it big. But the online game is far more complex than she could have imagined, taking her on an exploration of sex work, self-expression and the weighty impact of social media on young women. Unlike Fleabag, Chewing Gum et al, Mood is not a comedy. You might smile at the witty one-liners that she rhymes atop a rich soundtrack drawn from genres from disco to grime (“Cancel culture in my own home!” she raps, when her family kicks her out). But in the first two episodes there’s drugs, poverty, unemployment, racism and sex work – all dealt with without veering into moral panic, judgement or glamorisation. Unlike Sasha, who is surrounded by people who don’t take her talent seriously, Lecky says she’s “had many great mentors and supporters” throughout her career. As a child, she was “into everything artsy. I wanted to dance, I wanted to sing, I wanted to do drama. I was drawing a lot.” She excelled in choir and singing lessons, and was signed by a theatrical agent by 18, around the time she joined a youth theatre. Her bright academic record meant she was accepted to King’s College for war studies, but the demands of the course meant she couldn’t act on the side. She dropped out, heading to drama school instead. She was writing throughout – short stories, plays, poems. She won a place on a BBC scheme and ended up writing for the EastEnders spin-off E20 as a teenager. “But I had no notion of how somebody like myself would become a writer. I knew I was always writing, but I just didn’t think I could make money from it.” It was only after she left drama school that Lecky’s focus turned back to writing. “When I got my writing agent, I was like: ‘Here are all these scripts I’ve written.’ There was a body of work that was unseen, because it’s what I loved to do.” Happily, Lecky says her family have always been supportive, which she recognises is not always the case for working-class creatives, and that she no longer needs to pick between her passions. “I feel more empowered now, much more than when I was trying to pay my rent. A lot of the time you audition for stuff and you don’t even fucking want it, but you’re just like: ‘I need to eat.’” The realities of money and identity are at the heart of Mood. We see how characters experience similar things differently due to race, economics or mental health. In one scene, Sasha visits her friend – who is Black – and is joined by her white roommate as she laughs about the “free the nipple” movement on Instagram: “You posh girls,” says Sasha’s pal. “If we did that, everyone would be chatting shit.” To create the script, Lecky interviewed dozens of women involved in online sex work. She has consistently said in interviews that she is pro-sex work and sex-worker rights. But the real-life stories she heard didn’t fall neatly into either side of the debate. “I think that’s why, with this show, I’ve tried to look at the nuance,” she says. “I met one woman who came across very happy, and acted like she loved all of it. But later she levelled with me that there were things about it that bothered her. She makes shitloads of money, though.” There were other stories she came across, which she found herself disturbed by. “I formed connections with people I was talking to, particularly the younger girls. I was really fearful for one because she was doing it in secret. “I said to her the first time she did it: ‘What did you buy?’ She said: ‘I bought weave bundles.’ That sent me. I thought there was something quite innocent about it. Her Instagram was flawless, stunted out. I just thought: “At that age, I don’t remember being 18 and feeling a pressure that I had to look like I had all this money. Why would you have that much money?” Did she find there was a split in how women perceived sex work, along generational, class or even racial lines? “Not generationally, as everyone I spoke to was under 35. But there can be a split, culturally, in terms of what your upbringing is and what you’re exposed to sexually and politically. Where I grew up in east London, there was a lot of sex-shaming in secondary schools. I think back to school years and think how fucking hard you have it as a teenage girl.” Lecky was wary of passing judgment on any of the stories her interviewees shared with her. “If somebody tells me something, I take them at their word because how can I tell a grown woman that she isn’t empowered? Who am I to define somebody else’s liberation? Even that 18-year-old girl, in my head, I’m going: ‘When she’s my age [Lecky is 31], she’s going to regret this.’ But maybe she won’t, maybe that’s my internalised [misogyny]. There are a lot of people grinding for their jobs and getting far less money – so who’s happier?” I tell Lecky that we share some background – I grew up in a neighbouring working-class, ethnically diverse borough – and I recognised many of the small details, from the slang to the shots of the Docklands Light Railway (most shows opt for the tube). She smiles. “Specificity is my thing. I didn’t want [Mood to feel] general, because I’d done so much research.” Does she feel the burden of representation when she writes about these marginalised groups, especially ones so close to home? “I don’t actually feel that pressure, interestingly. These are people from my experience and I love my community. I see it more as a positive, as inspiration. I can’t get everything right. I’m OK with that.” Lecky says getting to this point has been a journey. She recalls coming off stage after performances of Superhoe and meeting audience members in tears. “They would come up to me afterwards and tell me secrets, maybe they’d sofa-surfed and slept with the guy whose sofa it was for free rent. It was really sad because it was like they were carrying this shame. I’m like: “That’s not your shame to bear. Someone’s been exploiting you.” When adapting the show into the scripts needed for Mood, Lecky would feel bad for having to cut those stories. But soon enough she learned it simply wasn’t possible for one writer to do it all. “You are one person. You can’t represent your whole community. I’m like: ‘You lot who are commissioners, commission more people from the community who have different experiences.’ It’s not for me to do that. That’s not me resisting, that’s me going: ‘I want to inspire everybody around me. Everybody should feel like they can tell whatever story, and equally people going: ‘It’s autobiographical, it’s your story,’ I say: “No, it’s not, it’s just one story I want to tell.” As she packs her bag to leave we discuss the upcoming premiere for Mood. Perhaps it’s local pride but I suddenly have a great desire for her to have the best time. “I hope you’re going to buy a new outfit,” I say, imagining the fun of shopping. She replies, laughing: “Why, do you not like what I’m wearing?” She departs, smiling at the parting banter. “Yep,” I think, “she’s cool.” Mood begins 1 March on BBC Three",Arts/Television & radio,"‘Commissioners: hire more people with different experiences!’ Meet Nicôle Lecky, TV’s newest superstar",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/18/nicole-lecky-tv-newest-superstar-bbc-mood
2/18/2022,"Ijust adore skiing. Not the part where you throw yourself down mountains – I’m hopeless at that, it’s genetic, I’m just not posh enough. No, I’m here purely for the aesthetic. The vibe. Cosy quilting and furry ear muffs; Bond-baddie polo necks and cartoonish moon boots.Skiing is a moodboard of all the good bits of winter. Crunchy snow, invigorating crisp air, hot chocolate, the promise of longer days and fresh adventure. I love the first bit of winter, until the end of December. In those months the world is fairy-lit and gingerbread scented and I can wish merry Christmas to the nice man in the post office and feel like I’m in the Downton Abbey festive special, except for it being Ed Sheeran on the radio instead of Christmas carols. January and February are a different story. These are the depths of the rubbish part of winter, to be trudged through while feeling listless. But while most of us are waiting grumpily at the bus stop with cold toes, trying not to get splashed by noxious puddle water and feeling vaguely cross that it’s still dark all the time, the ski people are snugly padded and rosy-cheeked and wearing sunglasses. Ski people make winter look fabulous – and I want in. Which is where faux-ski fashion comes in. Faux-ski is like après ski but without the eye-watering expense of an actual ski holiday. Faux-ski – wearing ski jackets and snow boots and Alpine knitwear, but for real life – is this season’s breakout outerwear trend.  The 1% already wear their plush Moncler or Perfect Moment quilting out to brunch in Mayfair on chilly days, the pricey ski jacket having taken over where the fur coat left off, a decade or two ago, among the jet set. That arctic white does set off a Verbier tan beautifully, it must be said. But this is different, because faux-ski is for everyone. Now that the kind of North Face quilted jackets that were once reserved for hiking expeditions are standard dog-walking attire, the rise of ski stuff as a fashion trend is the logical next step in jazzing up your coat game. Faux-ski is way more fun than the generic dark-Puffa-with-trackpants look that is still all around us. The high collars that keep out windchill on the slopes bring a dash of Audrey Hepburn elegance. Belted quilted jackets – practical for skiing because they stop snow from sliding up your back if you fall on your bum – have a Y2K snow bunny vibe, which is very this season. (At the time of writing, there were some bargain Isabel Marant Etoile “Dilys” ski jackets to be had in the Net-a-Porter sale.) Chevrons and high-shine metallics are as effective for getting noticed in real life as they are for getting spotted by mountain rescue. Moon boots – and the thigh-hugging, bootcut trousers that work with them – are very Paris Hilton, which as you will be aware of by now is once again A Good Thing, however baffling that might seem. Even balaclavas (also known as ski masks) have been all over TikTok, and starring in Zara window displays, recently. Doubling as a face covering, the balaclava is a practical pandemic winter accessory.There is one more accessory you need. Not goggles, but attitude. For which, feel free to channel Lady Gaga in her blood-red snowsuit in the House of Gucci movie, downing an alfresco espresso and rapping a spoon against her cup like a judge with a gavel. Nail that, and you are a bona fide skiing champ.

2/18/2022,"As you know, Oliver Dowden laments threats to all British statues – indeed, this week found the Conservative chairman in Washington DC, making a speech about such things to an American thinktank. As a keen student of his joined-up theories, I’ve always looked forward to the day Oliver feels ready to give us his speech on the disgraceful 2012 removal of the Jimmy Savile statue from Glasgow’s Scotstoun leisure centre. Have we not got to live with our history? Debate it, yes, question it, yes – but ultimately preserve every handcarved wooden statue of a paedo in whatever family setting happens to boast one. In the meantime, according to Dowden, woke ideology is putting the west at risk from countries such as Russia, even though Russians are so woke they have whole parks of torn-down statuary, featuring figures whose historical legacy they didn’t feel particularly minded to debate or live with when they were yanking them off the plinths. Absolute snowflakes.  I can’t remember whether the Tory chairman does street name culture-warring yet – only a matter of time, obviously – but he could certainly salute the tailors of London’s Savile Row for sticking with the name, no matter the vicious jibes about bespoke shellsuits that it doubtless drew from the wokerati of the time. And Oliver could also take issue with the users of the Scarborough footpath who no longer wished it to be known as Savile’s View, to say nothing of the local council which stripped Savile of the freedom of Scarborough. The monstrous television presenter’s ability to make use of said freedom was arguably limited at the time, given he was dead, but it was widely felt the act was symbolic and respectful of the victims. Forty odd miles away in York this week, the issue raises itself once more in the wake of Prince Andrew’s decision to agree a multimillion-dollar settlement with a woman he has never met, not even when she was a trafficked minor, and not even when there’s a photo of him with his arm round her which also features convicted child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell – a photo that was probably snapped by dead paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. According to the settlement statement, “Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein”. Which is weird, because when Emily Maitlis asked his HRH if he did, he honked: “No, still not … and the reason being that the people that I met and the opportunities that I was given to learn … were actually very useful.” Well quite. You don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater, and you don’t throw the Dummies Guide to Business out with the international child sex trafficker. In fact, you don’t even throw out the international child sex trafficker. Anyway. For whatever reason, the city of York is mulling its ties with the Duke thereof, with councillors declaring they will seek to revoke Prince Andrew’s honorary freedom of their city at the next full council meeting. Excitingly for Dowden’s speechwriters, this is not an isolated incident. Mid and East Antrim council will hold a debate in June on the renaming of Prince Andrew Way in Carrickfergus, though Prince Andrew Park and Prince Andrew Gardens in south Belfast both look to be getting away with it as things stand. By chance, a couple of weeks ago I read in the Shropshire Star about the residents of a Telford street who are also mulling a name change. Where once they were pleased or simply indifferent to live on Prince Andrew Drive, there are now differences of opinion among residents. Some feel that it’s time to freshen things up. “We think it should change,” said one, who was planning to write to the council. Others were more of the Dowden persuasion. “We don’t agree with what he might have done,” another neighbour told the paper, “but you can’t keep changing things. You can’t erase history. He’s still part of the royal family.” A further resident speculated that it wouldn’t make any difference. “I couldn’t be doing with the hassle of changing my address on everything,” she added. That in some ways feels most relatably British – the weary understanding that your street is named after some out-and-out shit, set against the full spectrum bureaucratic horror show of attempting to do something about it. It’s the absolute knowledge that what should be relatively simple will pretty soon involve someone very nice at the post office explaining to you that while your street might have a new name, you’re going to have to pay for a redirection of mail from your own home, to your own home, as technically the mapping software hasn’t caught up. Next: the bank. By the time you’re into your second hour of robot chat assistant with Yodel you’re very much at the stage of “Fine! I give in! I have always lived in Harold Shipman Row, and I always will! Restore factory settings and leave me to my fuming.” As one of the residents of Prince Andrew Drive commented tartly: “There’s another street near here called Sussex Close. I wouldn’t want to live there either!” Well now. That feels sufficiently generalised as to open a whole other can of worms. Could the entire county of Sussex suffer a kind of genre-killing, at the remote hands of two Montecito residents whose Spotify podcast has been taken into special measures? Given the deep-set establishment resistance to changing literally anything at all in the country if it relates to slavers and princes and other people who’ve “suffered enough”, we could be nearing the phase where it’s simpler for the Duke of York to hang on to his titles and York-based honours and so on, and for York itself to rebrand as something else entirely. Giuffre, say, or Maitlis. For now, it all remains very unclear. The fact is, we simply don’t KNOW what we’re allowed to feel about any of our local community environments unless some politician who lives in London tells us – ideally while he’s twatting about in Washington. Washington DC, that is – not Washington Tyne and Wear, which might well wish to consider the unfortunate associations with some of the most shameless opportunists in the world.

The ancient myth of Eurydice’s death, and its eerie aftermath when Orpheus tries to save her from Hades, anticipates the surrealists with its imagery of desire, death and the underworld. Its most beautiful modern telling is Jean Cocteau’s film Orphée. This painting is a kind of prehistory of Cocteau’s vision since it shows how the myth of Orpheus came to France: Niccolò dell’Abate was one of a group of Italian artists employed by the French monarchy at Fontainebleau, who injected a sensual classicism into French culture. In truth, we see the figures here as a parade of cavorting bodies and barely notice the story against the vast, blue, dreamy landscape.

2/18/2022,"Storm Eunice is battering parts of the UK, felling trees and scattering roof tiles as forecasters warn of a “significant threat to life”. But is it caused by climate breakdown, and can we expect an increase in such disruptive storms?  Eunice brewed in the central Atlantic and was spun up from the Azores towards Europe by the jet stream. Yes, gusts of up to 110mph have been recorded at the Needles lighthouse on the Isle of Wight. This has exceeded the prediction of 90mph winds, and is just under the record 120mph winds that hit during the devastating storm of 1987, during which 18 people died in one day. The Met Office says Eunice has the potential to be the worst storm since then. A rare red alert has been issued by the Met Office, with people asked to stay at home if they can. The government has convened Cobra to discuss response to the likely devastation ahead. Prof Hannah Cloke, a professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, said: “The Met Office red and amber warnings for high winds should not be taken lightly. Red means you need to act now because there is an imminent danger to life. Everyone who lives or works in those areas should be battening down the hatches, literally in some cases, to prevent people from being killed and injured and to protect your homes and businesses. “Let us be clear what this means. Winds of 70mph will uproot trees, which can block roads and crush cars or buildings. They can pick up roof tiles and hurl them around. If you are hit by one of those you will be seriously hurt or killed. Wind that strong will sweep people and vehicles off streets, and topple electricity lines. Do not take any chances. Stay inside.” Met Office scientists have said one of these can form. Matt Priestley, a research scientist at the University of Exeter, looking at storm tracks and extratropical cyclones, said they were small areas of very intense winds within a storm’s cyclone that were hard to predict. “They are generally about 10-20km wide and are generated by specific instabilities within the flight lines of storms and cause very high wind speeds. “They’re not a feature of all storms. They’re often just a feature of the most intense ones like Storm Eunice. The fact that they are such small scale but can have such high wind speeds makes forecasting them very, very difficult.” Michael Dukes, a forecaster at MetDesk, said it could be. He explained: “Although it is hard to pinpoint climate change as a reason for individual severe weather events, climate models do indicate an increase in these type of storms as the earth continues to slowly warm. So this is very much in line with what climate scientists have been warning us about for a number of years now.” While there is dispute between scientists over whether the storms themselves are likely to increase and become stronger, most agree that the climate crisis will make their impacts worse. The German climatologist Friederike Otto, who leads the pioneering World Weather Attribution service on whether droughts, big storms or heatwaves were made more likely by the climate emergency, said there was “very little evidence that winds in these winter storms have gotten stronger with climate change”. She said: “Nevertheless the damages of winter storms have gotten worse because of human-caused climate change for two reasons: one, the rainfall associated with these winter storms has become more intense, and many studies link this clearly to climate change; and two, because of sea-level rise, storm surges are higher and thus more damaging than they would otherwise be.” Richard Allan, a professor of climate science at the University of Reading, said: “Once-in-a-decade storms like Eunice are certain to batter the British Isles in the future but there is no compelling evidence that they will become more frequent or potent in terms of wind speeds. “Yet with more intense rainfall and higher sea levels as human-caused climate change continues to heat the planet, flooding from coastal storm surges and prolonged deluges will worsen still further when these rare, explosive storms hit us in a warmer world.”",News/Science,How bad is Storm Eunice – and is it a result of climate breakdown?,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/18/storm-eunice-climate-breakdown-crisis-extreme-weather
2/18/2022,"One of Europe’s most-wanted drug lords, a Belgian with a master’s degree in criminology, has been arrested in Switzerland after two years on the run. Flor Bressers, 30, nicknamed “the finger cutter”, has been sought since 2020 when he was given a four-year jail sentence for kidnapping, slashing with a razor and beating a Dutch florist who failed to smuggle drugs past UK customs.  He was prosecuted previously in 2010 in Limburg for allegedly cutting off the finger of a Dutch criminal with pruning shears. He was acquitted for lack of evidence, but the alleged incident earned him his nickname. Bressers has been linked via numerous cases to a narcotics gang operating in Antwerp believed to have smuggled tonnes of cocaine from South America to Europe. He was on both a Belgian and Europol most-wanted list for kidnapping, illegal restraint and hostage-taking and participation in a criminal organisation. It was thought Bressers had been hiding in South Africa but he was arrested in Zurich where he was found with his partner and child. The Belgian authorities have requested his extradition. Kristof Aerts, a spokesman for prosecutors in Antwerp, said Bressers was linked to ongoing judicial investigations in Antwerp, West Flanders and East Flanders. He said: “Serious organised crime is the common thread here. These include investigations into the international trafficking of drugs in which the violence was committed. “Last night, the fugitive was arrested in Switzerland. The arrest, carried out by special units and with the help of other Swiss police forces, is the result of an intensive manhunt that lasted several months.” Experts have warned that the extreme violence of the drug cartels operating in Mexico and Colombia has been exported to Europe in recent years. Earlier this month, prosecutors in Amsterdam said recreational drug users should reflect on the discovery of a soundproofed torture chamber in Wouwse Plantage in Brabant, in the Netherlands. In the shipping container, detectives had found a refashioned dentist’s chair, with straps for tying arms and legs, finger clamps, scalpels, claw hammers, pliers, loppers, pruning shears, gas burners, tie wraps and duct tape.",News/World news,‘Finger cutter’ drug lord arrested in Switzerland,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/18/finger-cutter-drug-lord-flor-bressers-arrested-in-switzerland
2/18/2022,"Six African countries – Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia – will be the first on the continent to receive the technology needed to produce their own mRNA vaccines from a scheme headed by the World Health Organization. The groundbreaking project aims to assist low- and middle-income countries in manufacturing mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards, with the aim of ending much of the reliance of African countries on vaccine manufacturers outside the continent.  The announcement comes in the same week that BioNTech, which produces the Pfizer vaccine for Covid-19 – itself an mRNA vaccine – announced it planned to deliver factory facilities built out of shipping containers to several African countries to allow the Pfizer vaccine to be produced on the continent. Primarily set up to address the Covid-19 pandemic, the global mRNA hub has the potential to expand manufacturing capacity for other vaccines and products, such as insulin to treat diabetes, cancer medicines and, potentially, vaccines for diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. The WHO established its global mRNA technology transfer hub after vaccine hoarding by wealthy countries – and problems with supply from India, as companies prioritised sales to governments that could pay the highest price – meant low- and middle-income countries were pushed to the back of the queue for Covid-19 vaccines. The scheme’s ultimate goal is to spread capacity for national and regional production to all health technologies. While the BioNTech initiative was welcomed for potentially shortening the supply chain of the Pfizer vaccine to Africa, it was also criticised for not sharing technological knowhow, which the WHO project will go some way towards redressing. “No other event like the Covid-19 pandemic has shown that reliance on a few companies to supply global public goods is limiting, and dangerous,” said the WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announcing the first recipients of the technology on Friday after visiting the hub in South Africa last week. “The hub will be not just for South Africa, it’s for Africa, Africa and the whole world, because the spokes will be distributed all over the world.” “The best way to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage is to significantly increase the capacity of all regions to manufacture the health products they need.” “We expect clinical trials [in South Africa] to start in the fourth quarter of this year, with approval expected in 2024, but this process can be sped up, [and] there are other options that the hub is exploring. Tedros added that the benefits of this initiative would “extend far beyond Covid-19, by creating a platform for vaccines against other diseases including malaria, tuberculosis and even cancer. So this is a strategic investment, not just for Covid, but for all the major health problems that we face”. Tedros has repeatedly called for equitable access to vaccines in order to beat the pandemic, and rails against the way wealthy nations have hoarded doses, leaving Africa lagging behind other continents in the global vaccination effort. He pointed out on Friday that 116 countries globally were still off-track for the target of vaccinating 70% of the population by the middle of this year, while 80% of the population of Africa was yet to receive a single dose. Currently only 1% of the vaccines used in Africa are produced on the continent of about 1.3 billion people. The WHO said it would work with the six countries to develop a roadmap of training and support so they could start producing vaccines as soon as possible. Training will begin in March. The South African hub is already producing mRNA vaccines at laboratory scale and is scaling up towards commercial scale. The South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said Friday’s announcement “means mutual respect, mutual recognition of what we can all bring to the party, investment in our economies, infrastructure investment and, in many ways, giving back to the continent”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said supporting African health sovereignty was one of the key goals of starting up local production, “to empower regions and countries to fend for themselves, during crises, and in peacetime”. Ramaphosa said on Friday that the global vaccine distribution scheme Covax and vaccines alliance Gavi should commit themselves to buying vaccines from local manufacturing hubs. “The lack of a market for vaccines produced in Africa is something that should be concerning to all of us. Organisations such as Covax and Gavi need to commit to buying vaccines from local manufacturers instead of going outside of those hubs that have been set up,” Ramaphosa said.",News/Society,Six African countries to begin making mRNA vaccines as part of WHO scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/18/six-african-countries-to-begin-making-mrna-vaccines-as-part-of-who-scheme
2/18/2022,"The death of a newborn baby with Lassa fever in Luton is a grim reminder of the global threat posed by deadly infectious diseases. Three cases have been confirmed in England – the first time the acute viral illness normally only seen in west Africa has emerged in the UK for 13 years. This weekend, officials from the UK Health Security Agency are closely monitoring hundreds of people identified as potential contacts of the three cases. The Guardian has learned many of these individuals will continue to be monitored for the rest of the month and into March.  The NHS is also performing risk assessments of staff and patients who were in the same areas as the Lassa fever patients in Luton and Dunstable University hospital and Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge. Although most people with the disease will make a full recovery, severe illness can occur in some and one in every 100 infected will die. No further cases have been identified to date. But global health experts say the return of Lassa fever – at a time when the UK is still fighting off another deadly infectious disease, Covid-19 – is a sign of worse things to come. “The three confirmed cases of the potentially deadly Lassa fever in the UK, now very sadly including one death, are a stark reminder of our interconnected world and the need to continue to invest in outbreak preparedness and response efforts,” said Dr Melanie Saville, the director of vaccine development at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Globally, the number of people contracting infectious diseases such as Lassa fever, the harms they can cause and their abilities to move rapidly from one side of the world to the other are growing – and for a variety of reasons, according to Saville. “Emerging infectious diseases are increasing in prevalence, severity and spread as a result of climate change, global transportation and human encroachment into previously isolated areas,” she said. The growing threat posed by deadly infectious diseases, Saville said, underlines the “urgent need for vaccines”. CEPI is now advancing the development of six Lassa fever vaccines. Three of these – developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, the International Aids Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), and Themis Bioscience – are the first in the world to enter clinical trials. The ultimate goal, Saville said, was to produce a licensed Lassa vaccine for routine immunisation. To enable this to happen, the largest-ever Lassa fever study, called Enable, has been launched to provide a more accurate assessment of the incidence of Lassa fever infections in west Africa. More than 20,000 people are being recruited to take part in the study, which will provide key information to help guide future late-stage Lassa vaccine clinical trials and potential vaccination strategies following licensure of a product. Some scientists have raised concerns that lessons have not been learned from Covid-19 about the need to properly fund the development of vaccines for other deadly infectious diseases. Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert, one of the creators of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, warned in October her team was struggling to raise the money needed to develop vaccines against diseases including Lassa fever. “We’ve actually gone backwards in terms of the work we’re doing on development of vaccines for the outbreak pathogens before the pandemic,” she said. “It’s just really slowed right down. Trying to get that moving again is really difficult and the funding still isn’t there to move that on.” That message might slowly be getting through. This week, the UK government said research into vaccines against deadly infectious diseases would be backed by a new £10m fund. The UK Vaccine Network will provide grants for 22 projects aimed at tackling severe illnesses in low- and middle-income countries. They include £498,000 to DIOSynVax to develop its vaccine against Lassa fever, Ebola and Marburg virus disease. The real hope, though, according to Saville, is the development of a vaccine that could be prepared for use against a new disease that has not yet emerged, such as a new member of the Lassa fever’s Arenaviridae viral family. Recognising that new viruses from this family could emerge in the future with greater transmissibility and/or fatality rates, experts are already using the work on the Lassa vaccine to guide the creation of a prototypic vaccine for use against the Arenaviridae family. “The idea here is that this prototype vaccine could be ready to be pulled off the shelf and swiftly adapted next time a novel Arenaviridae virus emerges,” said Saville. “That way, we don’t lose valuable time creating a new vaccine from scratch.” The good news is, for now at least, Lassa fever poses very little risk to people in the UK and is nowhere near as dangerous as Covid-19, which has killed 160,000 in the UK the past two years. “Lassa fever is a serious infection, but is nothing like as infectious as Covid-19,” said Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton. “Previous studies have estimated the R number of Lassa to be roughly between 1.0 and 1.6. The original wild-type coronavirus at the start of this pandemic had an R number of about 3, and the variants have become increasingly infectious. “Of course, any Lassa cases within the UK are of concern. However, we won’t be seeing transmission anything like the scale we have with the Covid-19 pandemic, and the risks to the wider public are very low.”",News/Science,"UK Lassa fever death highlights global threat of infectious diseases, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/18/uk-lassa-fever-death-highlight-global-threat-infectious-diseases-expert-outbreak-preparedness
2/18/2022,"Prince Harry “does not feel safe” when he is visiting the UK, a place that “is, and always will be, his home,” his legal team have told the high court. The prince’s desire to return to see family and friends was emphasised on the first day of a legal hearing related to his claim over the Home Office’s decision not to allow him to pay for police protection for himself and his family while in the UK.  The Duke of Sussex wants to bring his children to visit from the US, but he and his family are “unable to return to his home” because it is too dangerous, a legal representative previously said. A hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, which the duke did not attend, took place on Friday to hear an application by lawyers for Harry and the Home Office for the court to take steps to ensure some matters concerning arrangements for the security of public figures in the UK, including royals, should remain confidential. Referring to the duke’s claim over the Home Office decision, Shaheed Fatima QC for Harry, said: “This claim is about the fact that the claimant does not feel safe when he is in the UK given the security arrangements that were applied to him in June 2021 and will continue to be applied to him if he decides to come back. “And, of course, it should go without saying that he wants to come back: to see family and friends and to continue to support the charities that are so close to his heart. Most of all, this is, and always will be, his home.” Prince Harry lost his taxpayer-funded police protection when he and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, stepped back from royal duties in 2020. The couple privately fund their security in the US, where they now live. Harry’s concerns follow an incident in London in 2021, when he returned to the UK for the unveiling of a statue of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and his car was reportedly chased by photographers as he left a charity event. Part of Friday’s hearing, concerning legal matters, has been taking place in public before other details relating to security arrangements will be discussed in private. Security provision for the couple was one of the main issues when Harry and Meghan announced they were stepping down as working royals. Their website at the time suggested they believed the Home Office, through the Metropolitan police, should continue to provide protection for the family.",News/UK news,"Prince Harry ‘does not feel safe in UK’, lawyers tell high court",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/18/prince-harry-does-not-feel-safe-in-uk-lawyers-tell-high-court

Almost all operators, from Northern to Southeastern, advised against travel. Despite snow in Scotland, ScotRail, which was badly affected by Storm Dudley earlier this week, was planning to run services but told passengers to check before travelling. Public transport authorities in Manchester and London, to where the Met Office extended its red weather warning on Friday, urged people to avoid non-essential journeys. Transport for London said London Overground services were disrupted by high winds in the morning. Roads are expected to be treacherous on Friday, from high winds and rain in the south and snow and ice in Scotland. Police in Devon and Cornwall have advised motorists not to travel if possible. Motoring services, including the AA, were experiencing high demand from broken-down motorists needing rescue. The RAC echoed advice to avoid unnecessary travel and for people who did drive to go slowly, be vigilant and keep their hands firmly on the steering wheel, with gusts of wind up to 90mph expected. Main bridges into Cornwall and across the Thames were closed because of high winds. The Severn bridge was closed, as was the Prince of Wales bridge on the M4. Other roads including the A66 cross-Pennine route and the M8 between Edinburgh and Glasgow were partially closed. More than 100 flights in total have been cancelled at Heathrow, Gatwick and other airports.
