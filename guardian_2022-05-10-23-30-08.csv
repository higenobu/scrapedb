5/10/2022,"Alist of pronouns for each cast and creative member in this production arrives before opening night. It tells us that Taylor McClaine, the actor playing the show’s titular character, uses they/them, which feels apt for an adaptation of a story about gender fluidity from 1928. Orlando reminds us that the idea of multiple selves is not a modern invention. Virginia Woolf’s hero who turns into a heroine during the story is also a time traveller. Woolf’s thrilling fantasy of liberation from time and gender constraints begins in the Elizabethan age and ends in the 20th century, Orlando voyaging through it rakishly, having affairs and heartbreaks along the way. McClaine turns out to be perfect casting: arch, fresh-faced and puckish with a flame of red hair. This is a dinky version of the story that ekes out every last delicious drop of wit from Woolf’s text, as well as the voluptuous beauty of her language. It is an incredibly faithful adaptation by Sarah Ruhl, a feat in itself given the production lasts only 90 minutes. Stella Powell-Jones’s intelligent direction gives the show a self-conscious sense of story-building. The book’s biographical voice is turned into joint narration between the five cast members, who double up in roles and include Tigger Blaize, Skye Hallam, Rosalind Lailey and Stanton Wright. Each is as sharp and mischievous as the next. Initially it has the spirit of a parlour game but who can begrudge that when it is so smartly and slickly done? The drama becomes better as it loses the slightly starchy archness and builds on its joyful humour, which is sometimes delightfully physical. Ceci Calf’s set design creates an almost childlike spirit of make-believe; there is a miniature version of a stage on the set, naively painted, with curtains swinging open and sound effects made by the cast at times (Roly Botha’s sound design on the whole is excellent). Ali Hunter’s lighting design showers it with yet more magic and Emily Stuart’s costume design is profound. Orlando appears in Elizabethan ruff and knee-breeches at the start but then puts on period frocks and trousers. Despite their playfulness, the onstage costume changes underline not only the passing of time but also how feminine or masculine dress defines us. As Orlando says, it is the clothes that wear us and not the other way around. Femininity and masculinity themselves are, in this world, as slippery, unfixed and multiple as the clothes that are slipped on and off. “Who am I?” Orlando says towards the end, and then realises, ecstatically, that there is no single “I”. Orlando is at Jermyn Street theatre, London, until 28 May.",Arts/Stage,Orlando review – make a date for Virginia Woolf’s puckish time traveller,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/10/orlando-review-virginia-woolf
5/10/2022,"The government’s proposed ban on conversion practices intended to change people’s sexuality will in fact only fully cover under-18s, Downing Street has confirmed, saying it had to “strike the right balance” on outlawing the much-condemned practice. In an apparent change of plan likely to outrage equalities groups, No 10 said that adults in England and Wales who consented to sexuality conversion for religious or personal reasons would be allowed to do so. This is expected to be permitted only if “this does not cause serious harm”, officials said, with full details to be set out in the promised conversion therapy bill. The bill has already been watered down – originally it was planned also to outlaw similar practices intended to change someone’s approach to their gender identity. That was dropped, to the consternation of equalities groups and some MPs. The government document outlining the Queen’s speech said the law, targeted at “abhorrent conversion therapy practices”, would “protect under-18s, regardless of circumstance, and over-18s who do not consent and who are coerced or forced to undergo conversion therapy practices”. Asked whether this meant adults could undertake such practices with consent, Boris Johnsons’s official spokesperson said: “That’s the understanding. Obviously, we’ll set out the full details when we publish the bill.” Asked why this was the case when Johnson had described the process as “abhorrent”, the spokesperson said: “Obviously, this is a difficult area. We need to strike the right balance, but I think it’s important to wait for the full details of the bill to be set out.” He added: “It is obviously abhorrent to force this on anyone. But it is a complex area that needs careful management.”",News/Society,"Bill banning conversion practices will only fully cover under-18s, No 10 says",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/10/bill-banning-conversion-practices-england-wales-under-18s
5/10/2022,"Fur Clemt, meaning “very hungry” in Wigan dialect, is a much-loved community supermarket which sells unsold or overproduced food at a heavily discounted price to local people struggling with their household budgets. Since December, its owner, Shirley Southworth, has observed a shift: “We’ve seen membership soar and become more varied … It’s not just people on benefits, it’s those who are just about managing, people trying to keep their head above water.” What’s changed is the cost of living crisis, which has resulted in household spending rising most for those on the lowest incomes, who have the smallest margins and are unable to cut down on luxuries. This is not just the 20% of households living in poverty in Pemberton, where Fur Clemt is based, but also many families who are better-off.For Southworth, the volunteer-run organisation is about local people taking control. “It’s about doing something for yourself and not having it done by you … Wigan is a Labour-run council and they’re really supportive, but I’m not sure with central government there’s much connection between what’s going on on the ground and what they perceive.”Her scepticism is reflected in new polling of 2,164 people, which showed that just 14% trusted the government to solve the cost of living crisis, according to New Local, a thinktank that represents councils and advocates for community-run services. More than two-thirds (68%) argued that more power should be given to local communities to tackle the issue themselves, and nearly four-fifths (79%) said Westminster and Whitehall were making decisions “about people and places they know little about”. This may help explain Conservative losses in the local elections, which have been interpreted as punishment from voters dissatisfied with the prime minister’s perceived failure to tackle the impact of soaring inflation – expected to reach 10% this year – and the biggest annual decline in living standards since records began in 1956. Fur Clemt is one of a growing number of community-led organisations which, exasperated with a lack of government support to tackle the cost of living crisis, are taking matters into their own hands. Other organisations include the Ambition Lawrence Weston charity, based in a deprived housing estate in Bristol, which raised £4m to build the tallest wind turbine in England. The revenue it generates will be spent on community projects, while the energy it produces will alleviate fuel poverty for local families.These projects especially benefit people who would not have expected to need extra support prior to the cost of living crisis, such as working families. Fur Clemt’s model removed the stigma associated with food banks, said Southworth, by marketing itself as an environmental project aimed at reducing food waste and allowing people to buy the food they wanted.“One lady comes in twice a week and said she took her children to Legoland on the savings she had made, and she wouldn’t have been able to afford to do that otherwise. It gives families the opportunity to make savings. It might be to buy electricity or gas, but it might also be to treat the kids to something,” she added. Southworth works with Wigan council and community groups to reach the most vulnerable, including domestic violence survivors and homeless people. She also runs cooking classes on how to use the food in stock, and is negotiating fuel vouchers with an energy company to offset soaring gas and electricity costs. To enable more organisations to emulate Fur Clemt, New Local is calling for the government to introduce a community power act, which would devolve power to councils and local people to give them a greater say over public spaces, services and local investment. The thinktank says this differs from David Cameron’s much-derided “big society” because the state would adequately resource communities and voluntary organisations, for instance by giving them 25% of the levelling up budget, which at present prioritises large-scale infrastructure projects. The New Local chief executive, Adam Lent, said: “Rather than struggle for half-baked, top-down solutions, the government should trust and resource communities to tackle the issues that are affecting them directly at a local level. That would really be giving back control.” A government spokesperson said this was under way through London-style devolution deals, which aimed to put “power into the hands of those who know their communities best” by 2030. He added that the government was boosting councils with extra funding, while changes to universal credit and direct support for bills would help working families. For projects such as Fur Clemt, extra funding could not come soon enough, Southworth said. “Funding always helps because we can pass that on in various ways to the community. Our costs are rising as well. We have to collect our food, and the van and fuel costs are going up. It’s an expensive project to run and it’s getting more expensive, especially with the price of gas and electricity going up.”",News/Society,Taking back control: the local projects stepping up in the cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/10/taking-back-control-the-local-projects-stepping-up-in-the-cost-of-living-crisis
5/10/2022,"There’s a sweet moment in this mostly music documentary about rock star Nick Cave, in which he talks about having always defined himself in the past as a musician or a performer, but now he thinks of himself increasingly as a father or a husband. He even jokes that recently he took the government’s advice to retrain during the pandemic and became a ceramicist, specialising in mock-Meissen figurines showing the devil at various stages of a melancholy life, several of which enigmatically involved sailors. As the soliloquy says, one man in his time plays many parts, and in Cave’s case one of those roles could be described as semi-professional documentary subject, as there have already been quite a few films about him – most notably Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard’s inventive 2014 portrait 20,000 Days on Earth. Just two years later, The Assassination of Jesse James director Andrew Dominik made another film about Cave, One More Time With Feeling, observing him at an incredibly painful time soon after the death of one of his sons, a tragedy barely mentioned but deeply felt both in that latter film and in this, a sort-of sequel, made before the death of another son, Jethro Lazenby. At that point, Cave seemed to have healed at least a little, finding comfort not just in music and making, but also in listening to others’ pain. We see him reading messages left by fans, posts where they share their own losses and challenges, and he responds with encouragement and warmth, like the priest in a virtual church dedicated to himself, but with a strong pastoral element all the same. Elsewhere the film engages with Cave and Warren Ellis’ creative bond, one that’s produced some sublime work but also self-indulgent noodling (of which there’s a little too much here). Indeed, some might wish the spotlight was on Ellis more, a fascinating character who may be the more musically gifted of the pair, but not as capable of holding the spotlight like Cave – who has his suits, rumbly baritone and carefully coiffed too-black hair. Nevertheless, there is much to enjoy, not least for fans of Marianne Faithfull, here on delightfully cranky form when called upon to contribute vocals for a performance.

What was the best thing you did on screen last year?The thing that stands out was going to America to cover the buildup to the George Floyd trial, and the protests that were going on. There was a sense that the pandemic had stifled progress on dealing with racism, and there was this buildup of emotion that spilt out on to the streets in the days before the verdict, with some people releasing pent-up feelings they had had for their whole lives. It was a striking period of time. What would you be doing if you weren’t a presenter?I had a place at medical school. My father was a doctor and I spent my childhood thinking I was going to be one, too. But looking back, I think if I had gone into medicine, I would’ve ended up quitting and maybe becoming a lawyer. Which TV show made you want to be on TVI never intended to get into my line of work, but I did grow up watching the likes of Robin Day on Question Time and Brian Walden on Weekend World, and thinking that it was amazing to be able to do in-depth political interviews and hold people to account.

Throughout my news career I’ve been mistaken for George Alagiah or Martin Bashir. What show had you gripped during the last year?Succession.

And there are constant reminders of its links to reality – you can’t ever get away from the fact that you’re thinking about the Murdochs.

5/10/2022,"Ports and unions have cast doubt on the viability of legislation announced in the Queens Speech to ensure P&O and other ferry operators pay seafarers the minimum wage. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said that the new bill, introduced in response to P&O Ferries’ sacking of 800 crew, showed that the government would “stop at nothing” to ensure fair pay. However, the British Ports Association (BPA) said it was “unclear” that the legislation would work and said they could not enforce it, while the TUC dismissed the plans as unworkable. The Department for Transport said tens of thousands of seafarers would have to be paid the equivalent of the UK national minimum wage, currently £9.50 an hour, under provisions in the planned Harbours (Seafarers’ Remuneration) bill. The legislation will ban ferries that flout the pay rules from docking at UK ports. Talks are continuing with EU countries including France, Germany and Ireland to ensure routes between the countries become “minimum wage corridors”, guaranteeing minimum pay to seafarers operating them. Shapps said: “We will stop at nothing to make sure seafarers in UK ports are being paid fairly. P&O Ferries’ disgraceful actions do not represent the principles of our world-leading maritime sector, and changing the law on seafarer pay protection is a clear signal to everyone that we will not tolerate economic abuse of workers. “We will protect all seafarers regularly sailing in and out of UK ports and ensure they are not priced out of a job. Ferry operators which regularly call at UK ports will face consequences if they do not pay their workers fairly.” The government said it would consult closely with the ports and maritime sector on the scope of the new laws and enforcement measures over the next four weeks. Other vessels beyond ferries could be included. Cruise operators are known to pay far less than minimum wage to seafarers operating on ships out of Southampton. Possible enforcement measures include surcharges, suspension of port access and fines. The BPA said it was concerned by government expectations that ports should police shipping. The BPA chief executive, Richard Ballantyne, said: “The creation of new rules for ports to regulate ships in such a way is unprecedented. Enforcing the minimum wage is not an area where ports have a core competency. This should be a job for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency or HM Revenue and Customs. “It remains unclear whether the bill will achieve the government’s aims of improving longstanding issues for seafarers. Our initial assessment is that it might not be compatible with the UK’s obligations under international treaties or the current principles which governs our independent ports sector.” The TUC hit out at the government for dropping a promised employment bill that would have given greater rights and protection to all workers, including those at sea. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “This proposal is feeble and likely unworkable. “The government has done nothing to tackle the most flagrant labour abuse in years by P&O. Only stronger employment legislation that boosts worker protections and stops companies firing on the spot will prevent another P&O-type scandal.” Most of the 786 seafarers sacked by P&O Ferries in March were earning far more than the minimum wage, meaning the ferry operator would save millions in wages even after complying with new laws. The P&O Ferries chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, when appearing before MPs, said wage bills would also be slashed as new contracts would no longer cover seafarers’ rest periods between sailings and only “pay people when they work”.",News/Business,Ports and unions criticise Shapps’ plan for law on seafarers’ minimum wage,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/10/grant-shapps-law-seafarers-minimum-wage-queens-speech

5/10/2022,"The first thing one notices about Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is that this episode is as tonally different to standard Marvel fare as a nightmarish fever dream is from waking reality. Almost alone among the studio’s directors, Sam Raimi has been allowed to put his unique stamp on the saga – it feels at least as close to the film-maker’s earlier horror efforts Evil Dead II and Drag Me to Hell as it does to films such as Spider-Man: No Way Home and the Avengers movies. Why is Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch suddenly the villain? Who is America Chavez and why is Benedict Cumberbatch’s Doctor Strange a zombie version of himself? Let’s do a deep dive into the new film to find out. It has been quite the journey for Olsen’s character, from minor eastern European supervillain to fully paid-up member of the Avengers, to all-American housewife and now back to baddie in Multiverse of Madness. Despite having apparently found some kind of peace at the tail end of Disney+’s Wandavision, when she finally worked out it wasn’t cool to trap an entire town in her own heavily-stylised and rapidly shifting version of reality, Wanda now seems to have cracked again after coming into her full powers and chancing upon an evil book of dark magic known as the Darkhold. Her only mission is to reunite herself with the twin sons she discovered during Wandavision, Wiccan and Speed, having worked out that numerous alternative realities exist in which she and they live contented lives together. And yes, it’s a pity this ties into the sexist “mad mom” narrative that sees mothers as over-emotional creatures who make bad decisions because they love their children. Fortunately Olsen makes a wickedly evil protagonist, and one we know from the events of Wandavision is now powered-up to the extent that even Strange can’t take her down. How did you feel about her transition to supervillain? At the centre of Wanda’s focus is teenager America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), who has the power to jump between universes but initially cannot control it. This soon brings her into contact with the Strange we know and love from the main Marvel timeline (now known as Earth-616), when he and Wong are called upon to battle a giant one-eyed, multi-tentacled demon that we eventually discover was sent by Wanda to trap Chavez. At this point, if you’re wondering why the Scarlet Witch sent such an enormous blunt instrument against someone who we assume needs to be alive to wield her powers – well, that’s just one of the many plotholes in Multiverse of Madness. We should also mention that Chavez is at least the third instrument we’ve now come across for the introduction of the Multiverse, after Strange’s spell gone wrong in Spider-Man: No Way Home and Wanda’s antics in Wandavision. Or maybe it was there all along? Either way, Multiverse of Madness is not the most consistent of Marvel films (perhaps because Raimi found out halfway through writing it that he was expected to follow on from the events of Wandavision), and sometimes it feels as if it belongs in its very own universe. Those who were unaware of Raimi’s penchant for fast-cutting, unusual camera angles and regular reanimation of corpses might have found themselves a little confused by the action – let us know if you found yourself in this category. On the other hand, if you’re a fan of Evil Dead II, did you feel like all your Halloweens had come at once? In an attempt to flee as Maximoff launches an assault on the mystical retreat of Kamar-Taj, America accidentally transports herself and Strange to a new universe in which technology is to the fore and the United States government appears to be run by the Green party. Here, they are captured by a fresh version of the sorcerer’s old enemy Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and brought before the Illuminati (Hayley Atwell’s Captain Carter, John Krasinski’s Reed Richards, Patrick Stewart’s Professor X, Lashana Lynch’s Captain Marvel and Anson Mount’s Black Bolt.) None of them last very long here, as they are swiftly sliced and diced by an all-powerful Wanda, but the castings could have a lasting effect on the main Marvel Cinematic Universe (Earth-616). This is the first major sign we’ve seen of mutants (from the X-Men movies) and the Fantastic Four appearing in the MCU, even though we already knew that Disney’s purchase of 20th Century Fox made it possible for Marvel to start incorporating characters it sold the big screen rights to back in the late 90s. Krasinski’s appearance could easily just be stunt-casting – there has been a high-profile fan campaign for the American actor and his real-life wife Emily Blunt to appear as Richards and Sue Storm in the upcoming Fantastic Four reboot. Of the others, Patrick Stewart will be 82 in July, but you wouldn’t put it past him turning up again now he’s due to retire from Star Trek, following the upcoming third season of Picard. The Illuminati? This is an organisation that’s featured regularly in the comics, but with Tony Stark’s Iron Man dead in the main Marvel universe, it seems unlikely it will be turning up anytime soon in Earth-616. Perhaps the most long-lasting outcome of this encounter is that the Illuminati inform Strange that every version of himself in every universe ultimately becomes a force for evil. Turns out that episode of What If? was on the money after all. Can you see this revelation coming back to bite our hero in future? After being exiled to a ruined universe in which matter has turned upon itself, Earth-616 Strange meets a nefarious version of himself who has become corrupted by his own reality’s Darkhold, and sports a hideous third eye. He defeats his evil doppelganger, but in the movie’s final scene we see him bend over in agony as his own forehead pops out a horrifying extra peeper. This, presumably, is the result of having used the Darkhold to inhabit the dead version of himself we saw in the film’s opening scenes and rescue Chavez from Wanda, who had been casting a spell to finally steal those inter-dimensional powers. Fortunately, a mid-credits scene shows that Strange has become swiftly accustomed to having triple sight – in the comics the Sorcerer Supreme is often able to use the extra eye without any creepy after-effects, even if it’s pretty grim to look at, and it seems to be the same Eye of Agamotto that our Strange wears around his neck (and once housed the Time Stone). Where does Multiverse of Madness leave Strange? He’s certainly still the MCU’s central defender against the forces of evil in the absence of Stark, particularly now that alternate realities have become such a big part of the movie saga. That mid-credits scene, in which Charlize Theron’s Clea appears and opens a portal to another universe, suggests that we’re moving into a new era in which the latter could be his love interest, rather than Rachel McAdams’ Christine Palmer. In the comics, Clea eventually becomes Strange’s wife, so how do you think this will set up the events of Doctor Strange 3?",Arts/Film,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness: tonal shifts, misogyny and new superheroes – discuss with spoilers",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/10/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-tonal-shifts-misogyny-and-new-superheroes-discuss-with-spoilers
5/10/2022,"A trade union has enforced a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to stop a female former employee repeating allegations of sexual harassment against the union’s general secretary. The Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA) was granted an injunction on Sunday night to prevent a former organiser, Claire Laycock, from breaching a confidentiality clause in a compromise agreement signed in November. Laycock, who worked for the TSSA for several years as an organiser in Yorkshire, had claimed that she was harassed by the union’s general secretary, Manuel Cortes, in a pub after a Christmas party in 2018. Cortes vehemently denies harassment and has apologised for any hurt caused by his behaviour. The union, which represents white-collar workers in the transport industry, said it had conducted an inquiry into the claims, which were not upheld. The use of NDAs in cases where sexual harassment has been alleged has been heavily criticised since the #MeToo movement. Confidentiality clauses are often written in to the settlement of employment cases, but campaigners argue that their use by companies and organisations has become endemic and say they can be misused to suppress details of wrongdoing including sexual harassment, discrimination and racism. The TSSA sought an injunction on Sunday night after Laycock repeated allegations of sexual harassment against Cortes and bullying claims against senior staff members in a video uploaded to Reel News, a website run by a collective in London. She claimed that Cortes had put his arm around her shoulder and asked her to kiss him at a Christmas party. She claimed that later that same evening, he asked her to “go outside” with him. According to Laycock, at a subsequent informal meeting attended by union reps Cortes apologised, saying he could not remember all his actions on that night and that he had been drinking. The TSSA said it had investigated Laycock’s allegations twice and her claims were not upheld. On Sunday, the union sought an injunction against Laycock, Reel News and a named publisher of the material. Mr Justice Fordham, presiding, said in his judgment: “The claimant’s application contends that this, on the face of it, is a case of an egregious breach by the third defendant [Laycock] of the non-disclosure agreement, known as a ‘COT3’, dated 15 November 2021.” The judge ruled in favour of a two-day interim injunction imposed just on Laycock. No injunction was imposed on Reel News or its publisher. The union will again seek an extension of the injunction on Tuesday in the high court. It has also emerged that a report on sexism in the union was conducted in June by a GMB branch that represents some TSSA staff. The GMB branch report recommended an in-depth independent inquiry into sexual harassment and management of sexual harassment complaints. Staff at the TSSA said the report’s recommendations had not been acted upon. The TSSA said only 18 out of 48 staff members responded to the GMB survey, that some of the questions were not specific to the TSSA, and that the union had commissioned an independent report by an academic examining the culture and practices of the union. A spokesperson for the union said the TSSA has not, does not and will not seek to silence wrongdoing. “Upon leaving employment with TSSA, Ms Laycock signed an Acas-negotiated agreement which ensured that she was always fully entitled to make valid disclosures of all and any information. “What it did not permit, was for her to repeat allegations which were always strenuously denied, and after a thorough investigation were not upheld. Following further consideration on appeal in the union that position was confirmed. “The obligations in the Acas-negotiated agreement were mutual – ie applying to both TSSA and Ms Laycock, and TSSA has tried to respect that. “Acas-negotiated agreements when there is a dispute are an important and valid tool for workers and employers to use. It is important they are respected. TSSA is utterly opposed to sexism and harassment in all its forms,” she said. Regarding their own inquiry into the culture of the TSSA, the spokesperson said an independent report was being carried out by a third party “to look at whether our policies, practices and culture provide a safe space for all our members and staff”.",News/Politics,Union enforces NDA to stop woman repeating sexual harassment allegation,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/union-enforces-nda-to-stop-woman-repeating-sexual-harassment-allegation
5/10/2022,"Hayley Miranda, a 28-year-old contemporary dance producer, had never considered herself a cat person. “In fact,” she says, “I’ve always hated cats. But then I went to Greece last summer with my boyfriend and while there we found this four-week-old kitten, stray and alone. It ended up staying with us in our Airbnb for a few days until we found a shelter.” They returned to the UK, but Miranda had fallen in love with the kitten and wanted to adopt it. “A week before the kitten was due to come here, the woman at the shelter told us it was going to cost £1,000 to bring it here,” Miranda says. “We had to decide against it, which was really depressing, because we had fallen in love with this kitten.” Tato and Tina Her heart set on adopting, Miranda looked into rehoming kittens in the UK. “I found two at this shelter at Abbey Wood … we drove there, met these two cats, fell in love with them and then a week later brought them back home. It was such a whirlwind. That’s how we ended up with Tina and Tato. Everybody has these ideas that rescue animals are going to be terrible, but my two cats are the friendliest cats.” Miranda Larbi, 32, is another kitten adopter. Larbi grew up with cats; her parents adopted several rescues over the years. So when a friend told her that her cat was expecting kittens, Larbi asked about adopting one. On New Year’s Eve, she picked up Lemi. Miranda Larbi with Lemi Bonding with an adopted or rescue kitten is crucial. Having had cats when she was younger, Larbi says that she has always felt how you treat a cat early on can affect its temperament. “My thing is that me and my cats need to reach an understanding: you’re here as my emotional sucker and I’m here to be your emotional sucker,” she says. “So I’m going to pick you up all the time … and in return I would like you to purr and be present in my life.” Larbi and her partner make sure to shower Lemi with love and attention, “although, obviously, you have to leave it alone when it’s eating or cleaning itself”, she says. “But the more tactile and intimate you are with a kitten, the more relaxed and sociable it’s going to be.” One way that you can get on your new kitten’s good side is by giving them healthy, nutritious food. This is especially important for rescue cats that may not have had access to their ideal diet at a shelter, says Clare Hemmings, scientific communications manager at Royal Canin. “The first thing to do when you bring them home is to not change their food straight away. Once you’ve let them settle in, then you can start giving them something that is really going to support their digestion,” Hemmings says. “With a brand like Royal Canin, we know that our food is high quality and very digestible. It’s specifically designed to support ideal, healthy growth once they’re in their new home. Often, if they’ve come from a poor start in life, they haven’t got very strong immunity or may have a fragile digestive tract, and all of that could make them feel bad. It will make them more susceptible to illnesses, but they may also have a stomach ache a lot of the time. They are unlikely to feel confident if they have to stay near their litter tray.” Cats can often eat up to 20 small meals a day, so feeding your kitten little and often is preferable. “They can then monitor and regulate themselves,” Hemmings says. “They’re less likely to get overweight when they’re older and they don’t feel that stress of wondering where their next meal is coming from if they can access food at all times.” It’s important not to disturb your kitten while it’s eating. You also don’t need to give your cats treats in order to get them on side, either. “Treats are a human thing,” Clare says. “You can actually just use a few kibbles from their daily diet as treats. You can enrich their environments by using things like activity feeders or by scatter feeding, where if you have dry food you can just scatter it so that cats can use their natural hunting instinct to find it. It’s about environmental enrichment, really, and food can play a part in that.” For Miranda, food has been a key part of bonding with Tato and Tina. “We noticed a difference when we started feeding them the right food. They wanted to spend more time with us, so I think they appreciated us feeding them food that they liked.” Larbi agrees: “Knowing that the food we give Lemi is really nutritious ultimately means that we’re going to have a happy cat.” “It’s crazy,” Miranda adds. “My entire kitchen has turned into this cat room. I even went to a pottery class and made their food bowls. I’m a total cat convert.” Learn more about settling your new kitten into its new home at Royal Canin",Feline feeding,How to bond with a rescue kitten – and why healthy food is so important,https://www.theguardian.com/feline-feeding/2022/may/10/how-to-bond-with-a-rescue-kitten-and-why-healthy-food-is-so-important
5/10/2022,"Last night, Keir Starmer performed as The Gambler in a tiny space with cheap scenery and three journalists. The Labour leader’s promise to resign if Durham police issue him with a fixed penalty notice looked like an off-off-off-Broadway production that can only run to four actors who play all the parts. (No spoilers, but some of the above will return in later scenes as the executioners). As such, it certainly marks a new entry into the annals of hilariously mad-looking press conferences. For me, the only thing missing was Tiger Woods’ mum sitting purse-lipped in the front row, like she was in 2010 when Tiger apologised to the world for his cocktail waitress habit. “Integrity” was the big buzzword on that occasion, as it was with Starmer yesterday, with Woods promising “to start living a life of integrity”. Didn’t win a major again for nine years. So … read into that what you will. Starmer’s soliloquy certainly wasn’t good enough for the Daily Mail, which this morning has wet its collective pants that the Labour leader has had the temerity to answer the one question the Mail would have screamed at him for months if he hadn’t. As their Depend-wearing splash headline has it: “STARMER ACCUSED OF PILING PRESSURE ON POLICE”. I like the idea that you can “pressurise” the police. Can someone let me know how to do this, because I’m yet to receive so much as a callback over a burglary that took place over the Easter weekend. Happy to do an am-dram Tiger if necessary. The main thing to understand is that after months of their unilateral “special operation” on Beergate, this is the Mail’s victory parade. Today’s multi-article offering is the heavy artillery being wheeled through Fleet Street’s Red Square. There’s the classic late 1980s Stephen Glover missile (couple of near misses on the job but still claimed to be serviceable). Later-years weaponry tells its own sadly diminished story, of course. The supposedly state-of-the-art Wootton drone is actually just a Canon DSLR taped inside some bulky casing. But the big question on some lips is: have the game theorists at the Mail made a strategic miscalculation, effectively steering Tory MPs up the escalation ladder towards moving against their boy Johnson? For those of us who feel like this entire mushrooming shitshow is like watching the Cuban missile crisis re-enacted by the cast of Made in Chelsea, the signs are promising/infuriating (delete according to taste). Miscalculation certainly seems to be the judgment of Islington-based newsletter writer Dominic Cummings, who fired off another of his occasionally coherent tweets yesterday afternoon, in which he electronically cackled at the sight of supposed client journalists messing up their forward induction, and ending up accidentally working for the other side. Which is to say: for him. As Dominic had it, everyone in Westminster is “working on the Vote Leave operation to remove” Boris Johnson. Maybe. Either way, one of my very favourite things in politics is Cummings acting like Vote Leave is still a massive thing. He reminds me of Gary King, the Simon Pegg character in The World’s End, insisting to his deeply unwilling ex-friends that they get back together to recreate their epic pub crawl from 23 years earlier. “Fucking hell, Caino! What do you mean you don’t drink any more? That’s like a lion eating hummus!”. In fact, now that Benedict Cumberbatch has had his fun, I’d truly love to see what Pegg would do with the role of “Dominic Cummings”. You just know it would be it incredibly funny, but also elegiac and quietly heartbreaking. As for Starmer, the film that came to mind while watching his press conference was the South Park movie. When Keir was going “It’s about me! It’s about what I believe in politics! It’s a matter of integrity!”, I was reminded of the Canadian guy shouting “This is not aboot diplomacy! This is aboot dignity! This is aboot respect!”, and all the Americans falling about laughing. I mean, the Canadian guy IS actually in the right, but … yeah. A hard watch. I’m actually trying to think how any of this, at all, could now be more excruciating. At least no one has yet suggested David Miliband standing in Wakefield. Against the backdrop of the actually excruciating cost of living crisis, however, the current spectacle is looking increasingly surreal. And, dare I say it, increasingly like an all-male production. Even Angela Rayner’s promise to also resign if she was given an FPN happened offstage, like the death of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. From the snapper of the Beergate photograph (James Delingpole’s boy, as it turns out), to the Mail thrusters, to Cummings, to the weird machismo of Johnson’s reported description of Starmer as out of tune with the “raw instincts” of Brits, I can’t help noticing of late that women characters have sort of melted away/backed away from this increasingly histrionic story. Why is that? Just some mad statistical fluke I guess. Even so, I can’t help feeling that ladies across the nation are otherwise engaged, perhaps answering work emails at midnight while putting on a dark wash, sourcing a schoolchild’s platinum jubilee costume and wondering how on earth they’re going to bridge the gap between last May’s energy bills and this May’s. Thank heavens for the less emotional sex, then, who are out there in Red Square living their victorious lives for the rest of us.

5/10/2022,"The Home Office has admitted that lesbian, gay and bisexual refugees could be persecuted if sent to Rwanda – but still plans to fly them 4,000 miles to Kigali. The department’s equality impact assessment for the policy states there are “concerns” over the treatment of some LGBTQI+ people in the east African country, and that investigations point to “ill treatment” of this group being “more than one off”. It comes the day after the Home Office said the first group of people would be informed this week of the government’s intention to relocate them to Rwanda. The first flights were expected to take place in the coming months, it said, adding that lawyers for some of those affected were likely to launch proceedings to stop their removal. In the report released on Monday, the assessment says “there are concerns over the treatment of some LGBTQI+ people but we will continue to consider the impact on this group and take into account further evidence over the course of the partnership”. The report notes that homosexuality was decriminalised in 2010, but warns: “At this stage, investigations point to ill treatment being more than one off, but it does not appear to be systemic.” The government’s assessment of Rwanda’s human rights record, states that there are “not substantial grounds” for believing they would be at risk of treatment contrary to article 3 (freedom from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment) of the European convention of human rights in Rwanda. At the same time, the Foreign Office travel advice for Rwanda states that “individuals can experience discrimination and abuse, including from local authorities. There are no specific anti-discrimination laws that protect LGBT individuals.” Lewis Mudge, central Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said the risk assessment was an unrealistic assessment of a country with a poor human rights record. “The Home Office’s report reads like some serious wishful thinking and they seem to change the facts in order to justify a preordained conclusion. From claiming that refugees are not targeted for exercising their freedom of expression – when Congolese refugees rot in jail for protesting their living conditions – to claiming that LGBT people won’t risk serious harm in Rwanda – when evidence we’ve collected has LGBTI people detained, beaten, insulted and harassed for their sexual identity.” “This report is not grounded in reality. The Rwandan government has an abysmal record when it comes to guaranteeing internationally recognised refugee rights, statues and protocols. It’s difficult to imagine a less genuine assessment of Rwanda’s shocking human rights record,” he said. In another document released on Monday night, the government said it could send notices of intent to those coming to the UK without authorisation that would warn them they could be sent to Rwanda. A draft letter said: “I am writing to inform you about how your protection claim is being managed. We have evidence that before you claimed asylum in the United Kingdom, you were present in or had a connection to [name the safe country or countries]. This may have consequences for whether your claim is admitted to the UK asylum system. “We may also ask Rwanda, another country we consider to be safe, whether it would admit you, under the terms of the migration and economic development partnership between Rwanda and the UK.” Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said letters carrying a threat of Rwanda would prompt many of those waiting for their claims to be processed to disappear and hide from the authorities in the UK. “The government is failing in its duty of care to people in the asylum system by not recognising the devastating impact the threat of being expelled to Rwanda is having on them. “The process it is putting in place lacks compassion and demonstrates an inability to see the face behind the case. It shows how this government simply wants to treat vulnerable people who have fled war and oppression as human cargo to be transported thousands of miles away out of sight and out of mind,” he said.

5/10/2022,"We heard about the Avatar 2 trailer long before we saw it. Last month, the Hollywood Reporter found itself lumbered with the unenviable task of describing footage of Avatar: The Way of Water that was shown to theatrical exhibitors during CinemaCon. And, judging by the write-up, it was a spectacle of such awe-inspiring immensity that it could only ever realistically be rivalled by the second coming of Christ. Variety wrote breathlessly: “Exhibitors were immersed into different regions across the dazzling world of Pandora through sweeping visuals of the planet’s crystal blue oceans and lakes.” Forbes, meanwhile, was so blown away by the non-stop 3D extravaganza that it claimed Avatar had “won” CinemaCon. The message from anyone who saw the trailer was clear: Avatar is back, and ready to knock your socks off all over again. Well, luckily for us the Avatar 2 trailer went online yesterday, giving us lowly non-exhibitors a chance to have our brains splattered out of the back of our skulls as well. And, upon watching it, there’s a good chance that we all had the same thought at the same time. Wait, are we watching the thing that they watched? Because the trailer that dropped on YouTube really isn’t particularly spectacular. Some Na’vi jump across a tree. A sort of lizardy bird thing flies across some water. Some characters go for a bit of a swim. Sam Worthington’s character looks like he’s doing his best to hold in a fart. And, apart from the soundtrack – which is effectively the sound of Enya passing out from boredom and landing on a synthesiser – that’s about it. Look, Avatar happened a long time ago. And, even though its cultural cachet has long since been eroded by the deathless onslaught of superhero movies, people loved it at the time. They got to go to the cinema and wear a special pair of glasses and be blown away by all the best visuals that 2009 could muster. I saw Avatar at the cinema twice, for example. However, can I remember a single thing about it? Not really. There were blue people, and something called unobtanium, and an angry man ripping off the final act of Aliens as hard as he could, but that’s about it. If James Cameron is serious about making a long-dormant franchise like Avatar a going concern again – and he is, as his endless convoy of planned sequels will attest – then this trailer seems a bit like a misstep. There isn’t a trace of premise here, or character, or any real action to speak of. Instead, we’re given a minute and a half of nice-looking scenery. It’s like being held hostage to look at someone’s holiday photos. Now, there is a chance that my viewing conditions aren’t exactly ideal. Avatar has always been about watching something beautiful on a giant screen, through special glasses that make you feel completely immersed. This is how the CinemaCon attendees got to see the trailer, and perhaps that explains their awestruck reactions. Meanwhile, I watched it on a four-inch YouTube window at my desk on a sunny day while eating an apple. The conditions couldn’t be more mundane, and you suspect that James Cameron would melt like an Indiana Jones baddie if he ever caught anyone sullying his work like that. But this is how nine million people, and counting, have experienced the trailer. Far, far more people have watched it on laptops, or phones, or smartwatches for crying out loud, than in cinemas. And that will also extend to the film itself. For everyone who will pay to see Avatar 2 at the cinema like Cameron intended, scores more will wait for it to turn up for free on Disney+. And if the best thing that the film has going for it is lovely scenery that can only be properly appreciated through 3D glasses, that might be a problem. But it’s still early days. In truth, the Avatar 2 trailer felt less like a trailer and more like a tech demo. We still have months before the film is released. Maybe in the next trailer, stuff could actually happen. Wouldn’t that be novel?",Arts/Film,Avatar 2 trailer: prepare to be swept away by boredom,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/10/avatar-2-trailer-avatar-the-way-of-water-james-cameron-sequel
