1/31/2022,"One of the most remarkable traits of Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer throughout their incredible careers has been the way they have maintained their hunger for titles and sheer enthusiasm for the sport. No matter the obstacles in their path or the advancing of time, winning seems to bring them just as much joy as it did when they first tasted victory at the highest level. The sheer elation on Nadal’s face on Sunday as he completed an incredible comeback to beat Daniil Medvedev in the final of the Australian Open told its own story. A month and a half after the recovery from foot surgery left him wondering if he would even make it to Melbourne, and a month after he had Covid, which also interrupted his preparations, Nadal is back as champion and for now, the most successful of the lot.  Winning his first grand slam at 19, as Nadal did at the French Open in 2005, was a “super-special moment” but when you’re 35 and up until six weeks ago, you did not even know whether you would be able to play in the tournament, let alone win it, the feeling is something else altogether. “It has been more emotional than the first one, no doubt about that,” he said. “At later stages of your career, I think you are able to enjoy more these moments because you know the chances are less. When you are 19, when I achieved the first, of course is super special, but you know if you are playing well, you’re going to keep having chances to enjoy moments, no? Today you never know what can happen. Yeah, of course I am proud. The personal satisfaction is higher than years ago, no? I just stay more in the moment without thinking so far in front.” It was always a nice thought that in this era of three giants of the men’s game, somehow they might all end their careers level on 20 grand slam titles apiece. Having moved ahead with 21, Nadal will go to the French Open, where he has won the title an astonishing 13 times, with renewed confidence. And yet Nadal’s victory may also inspire Djokovic, who beat him on the way to the title in Paris last year, to come back even stronger. Unable to play at the Australian Open because of visa issues due to not being vaccinated against Covid, the world No 1 will have a point to prove. But the way Nadal played throughout the Australian Open, particularly when he trailed by two sets and faced triple break point at 3-2 down in the third set against Medvedev, will surely convince him he has more grand slam titles in him. At 35, and with his history of injuries, there’s no saying how many more years he will have but his desire remains undimmed, as he told the crowd. “A month and a half ago, I didn’t know if I was going to be able to be here. But you have given me the energy to keep trying to come back next year. “I want to keep going. Things can change quick but I feel lucky to have the chance to compete this way. It has been amazing for me and unforgettable. Of course I feel more confident that I’m going to keep going, keep fighting and playing this sport that makes me happy. I just feel confident that now I am going to have my chances to keep playing like this.” Both Djokovic and Federer were quick to congratulate Nadal on social media. Their rivalry has pushed each other and though Nadal is top of the pile for now, he is too modest to say he is the best. “I will never say I deserve” he said. “I don’t care much if I am the No 1, or not the No 1, the best of history or not the best of history. For me it’s about enjoying nights like today, that means everything for me. It means even more to me to achieve a second Australian Open than any other thing.” Asked what has taken him to this point, Nadal said: “Love for the game, passion, positive attitude, and working spirit … that’s all. And the right people next to me helping every single day. I think that’s all.” It’s a humility that has been present and obvious throughout his career, allowing him to accept the painful defeats and enjoy his many highs, from that first one in Paris to this latest one in Melbourne. On the evidence of the past fortnight, there is more to come.",Sport/Sport,Rafael Nadal’s body may be creaking but his desire remains undimmed | Simon Cambers,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/30/rafael-nadals-body-may-be-creaking-but-his-desire-remains-undimmed
1/31/2022,"Libya’s political class should stop conducting musical chairs to stay in power and focus instead on preparing for nationwide elections to be held by June, the special adviser to the UN secretary general has said. Stephanie Williams also warned of a possible resurgence of Islamic State if Libya were to fall back into total division.  Libya failed to hold elections for a president and parliament on 24 December partly due to rows over the eligibility of three controversial candidates, but also a wider fear that armed militia across the country would not accept the result if their candidate lost. In the ensuing month divisions have worsened, as Libya’s parliament, the House of Representatives (HoR), prepares to install a government to rival the UN-recognised Government of National Unity (GNU). The HoR says the GNU’s mandate expired on 24 December. Williams told the Guardian in an interview: “My fear is that some people may now manoeuvre for a prolonged period of delay. The HoR exists off a mandate that it was given in elections 3,700 days ago. It has been seven years, seven months since Libya went to the national polls. The other chamber, the High State Council, was elected 10 years ago. Their shelf life has long expired. This is ultimately a struggle over assets, power and money. That is quite a motive to hang on. “I want the HoR as quickly as possible to set out a credible political process that answers the question that almost 3 million Libyans have asked, which is: what has become of our elections? It is entirely possible for the HoR to put elections back on track, and for an electoral event to happen by June. “Instead they have turned their attention to the musical chairs game, and the formation of a new government to replace the GNU. Before discussing a new government whose mandate would be unknown, the HoR should set an election date.” Williams said: “There is a thirst for elections – nearly 2.5 million collected their voting cards and in the city of Benghazi alone 800 people came forward to stand in the parliament. There is another new generation of Libyans that want to exercise their political rights.” She added: “Elections can be part of a broader process of national reconciliation, particularly in countries where there has been no elections for a long time and there is an entrenched political elite who have had their noses in the trough for a long time.” She said she was ready to sit down immediately with the two chambers to hammer out a constitutional basis for the elections. Williams warned the possible formation of two governments in the country could be dangerous. The power vacuum last week led to the re-emergence of Islamic State in the south of the country, and an attempt on the life of the minister of justice. “The spectre of the black flag in the south being raised is something we are all very worried about, and already several Libyan National Army soldiers were killed last week,” she said. The elections set for 24 December never happened partly due to conflicting rulings by Libyan courts on the eligibility of three candidates – Gen Khalifa Haftar, the head of the Libyan National Army, Saif al-Islam Gadaffi, the son of the former Libyan dictator, and Abdul-Hamid Dbeibah, the head of the GNU. The international criminal court is inquiring into the first two while Dbeibah set aside a pledge that he would not stand in the elections, a precondition that had been set for anyone running the interim government. Williams said “it was not for the UN to decide which candidates stood. It is entirely a Libyan decision.” But she added: “You would have to ask Dbeibah what he thinks of a violation of a moral pledge.” She also called for the wings of the GNU, including its budget, to be clipped before it was replaced by an elected body. “The intention endorsed by the UN was for the GNU to be a small technocratic government to deliver services to the municipalities, to prepare for the elections, deal with the Covid crisis and restore electricity. That required only a modest budget.” She also called for the merger of Libya’s two central banks, but said this had to be accompanied by complete transparency, a criticism of a previous UN decision last year not to publish a UN-commissioned Deloitte review of the bank’s finances. She said: “Implementation of the merger of the two banks has to be conducted with total transparency. The distribution and management of oil revenues in the country has long been a key driver of this conflict, so need full transparency.” Williams’ own future as special adviser has been in question since Russia at the UN in New York last week refused to renew the mandate of the UN mission to Libya until a new special envoy was appointed. The mandate expires at the end of this month. Williams, an Arabic-speaking US diplomat, served in 2020 as acting director of the UN’s Libya mission after previously being its deputy director. She was persuaded to come out of retirement after her Russian-backed successor, Jan Kubiš, a Slovak, resigned under a welter of criticism. The UN secretary general appointed Williams as his special adviser in early December in part to circumvent Russian objections to her appointment.",News/World news,Libya elite told to end ‘game of musical chairs and focus on elections’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/30/libya-elite-told-to-end-game-of-musical-chairs-and-focus-on-elections
1/31/2022,"Almost 5bn items of personal protective equipment worth £2.7bn will be wasted as they are no longer needed or cannot safeguard NHS staff, ministers have revealed. The huge sum of money involved has prompted the Liberal Democrats to accuse the government of “extreme negligence on an industrial scale” in its use of public funds during the pandemic.  The revelation came in a written parliamentary answer by the health minister Edward Argar. He was responding to a question tabled by Wendy Chamberlain, the Liberal Democrats’ chief whip and MP for North East Fife, about how much of the PPE that had been procured had then not been used. Argar said the government’s PPE programme had ordered more than 36.4bn items since the pandemic struck in March 2020. “Of this, approximately 3.4bn units are currently identified as potential excess stock. The estimated price for those items is £2.2bn,” he said. The minister did not explain why so much PPE had ended up as “potential excess stock”, or define precisely what that meant. He also said that 6.96bn items of the 36.4bn ordered so far “are not currently provided to frontline services”. That could be because it was new stock that had not yet been through quality assurance checks or not deployed because “a different product is preferred”. He added: “Of these, 1.2bn items are deemed to be not fit for use. The purchase price for these items was £458m.” Chamberlain said the disclosures showed that “the government is burning a hole in the pocket of the taxpayer through its wastage of personal protective equipment”. She added: “The government has misspent billions of pounds of public money on vital PPE for frontline staff that is either inadequate or will never be used. This is carelessness of the highest magnitude.” The waste of £2.7bn was yet another of the government’s “string of damning failures” over PPE, she said. “Awarding contracts to chums unlawfully, frontline workers wearing bin bags and dodgy masks, and billions wasted – this is merely the latest sorry chapter in this Conservative government’s inglorious record of procuring and supplying PPE to health and care workers who have worked so hard, with a dangerous virus circulating in hospitals and care homes, to give people care over the last two years.” The British Medical Association expressed disquiet at the wasted PPE. “Hearing that stocks of much-needed PPE were potentially left unissued, and that inadequate PPE was ordered, are just more failings in a catalogue of poor management which has resulted in wastage of significant amounts of public funds,” said Dr Vishal Sharma, the chair of the consultants committee at the doctors’ union. Dr Jenny Vaughan, the chair of the Doctors’ Association UK, a grassroots network of NHS medics, said: “The distinction between making sure there is enough protection and keeping stock levels so high [that] much will go to waste seems to have been well and truly lost, along with taxpayers’ money wasted. “We recognise the need to make sure staff continue to be protected but every pound squandered is a pound that cannot be spent elsewhere in the NHS, where every pound counts. The government needs to be completely open about how this is happening, and where the money went.” The revelations raise serious questions about the government’s probity and candour over PPE, she said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We have been working tirelessly to deliver PPE to protect our health and social care staff on the frontline, with over 17.5bn PPE items delivered so far. “Where we have surplus stock of PPE, we have a range of measures we can take, including sales, donations, reuse and recycling or recovering costs from the supplier. In addition, we are working on plans to extend shelf life where appropriate.”",News/Society,"PPE worth £2.7bn bought for NHS will go unused, minister says",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/30/ppe-bought-for-nhs-waste-minister

1/31/2022,"The UK’s water industry has for years promised to clean up its reputation for pollution incidents, leaks and murky financial dealings. Yet once again, it is hoping for a clean start. In total, water companies spilled raw sewage into coastal bathing waters more than 5,500 times last year, prompting a another investigation by the Environment Agency and the industry regulator, Ofwat, in November.  Weeks later, Ofwat raised a red flag over the financial health of three of Britain’s biggest water companies – Southern, Yorkshire and SES. The regulator expressed concern about “weak levels of financial resilience” and levels of customer service that lagged behind the rest of the industry. For Southern, the resilience report gave a snapshot of the company’s financial health before an equity injection from a familiar character in the water sector’s chequered history, the Australian investment bank Macquarie. Macquarie gained notoriety for its role as the owner of Thames Water between 2006 and 2016, when it attracted fierce political scrutiny for extracting billions in shareholder dividends while Thames’s debt soared. By 2018 the Labour party had called for the sector to be returned to public ownership. But five years after selling out of Thames, the Australian infrastructure investor was given the regulator’s blessing to return to run one of the most troubled water companies in the industry – a move that raised eyebrows in the industry. The £1bn in fresh equity for Southern over the summer followed Ofwat’s decision to enforce a record £90m fine against Southern for deliberately pouring sewage into the sea, and came with a promise to invest a further £2bn over the next four years. Macquarie has not stopped there. Within months of its return to the UK’s water sector, it agreed to invest £130m in green bonds issued by a subsidiary of Affinity Water, and £120m in Anglian Water’s debt. The passive investments are part of the bank’s sprawling set of investments in UK infrastructure. Macquarie owns the Green Investment Bank, which was set up with UK taxpayer funds and controversially privatised four years ago. Under its ownership, GIB’s profits more than quadrupled to £144m for the year ending March 2021, compared with the year before. It has paid a total of £174m in dividends to Macquarie, which also owns gas networks, airports and telecoms service companies across the UK. Aileen Armstrong, a senior director at Ofwat, said the regulator had “really welcomed the money coming into the regulated business” while being “clear about the expectations on what the company needed to do for customers. “We have wanted to see a turnaround, and a component of that is an equity injection into the company, which is what this transaction did. We have been very clear – and would be with any prospective new owner – about what we expected of the regulated company and the need for a turnaround in the operations there,” she said. One senior industry source said Ofwat’s decision to give Macquarie its blessing to return to the water industry showed “just how desperate they were” after Southern’s record pollution fine and its troubling financial position. “Southern was not an attractive prospect for investors, and the company’s management was, perhaps unsurprisingly, on its knees. Investors would not have been falling over themselves to take a share of Southern,” the source said. However, Martin Bradley, the head of Macquarie’s “real assets” team in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said his bank was happy to return to the UK’s water industry despite “misunderstandings” over its ownership of Thames and the concerns over Southern’s financial health. “We didn’t pay a premium for Southern Water,” he said. “We invest in long-term infrastructure, and there’s nothing more long-term than the provision of utilities like water. This is what we do, and we think we’re quite good operators.” Macquarie’s spell at Thames was far from blemish-free. In 2017, the water company was fined £20m after admitting it dumped 1.4bn litres of raw sewage into the River Thames at six sites in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire between 2013 and 2014. The water company’s finances were also a cause for alarm, with Macquarie criticised for selling Thames with almost £11bn of debt after a decade in which the bank paid itself £1.6bn in dividends, ran up a £260m pension deficit and paid next to no UK corporation tax. A former senior Thames employee said of Macquarie: “Were they an effective, focused investor? Absolutely. But can you expect them to operate a utility in the public interest? Well, only if you are certain that the regulatory framework rewards the good behaviours and penalises the bad. Ofwat hasn’t always done that.” The characterisation of the Australian bank as a “vampire kangaroo”, or an aggressive asset stripper, has sometimes been unfair, he added. “They did extract more out of the company than would be ideal, but it was in full sight of the regulator. And where it made sense under the regulatory framework for Macquarie to invest in Thames, they were happy to invest too,” he said. Macquarie’s interests in the water sector are part of a more than £50bn of investment in UK infrastructure that it has either arranged or invested directly since 2005. These include Cadent, which is the UK’s largest gas distribution network operator, as well as the operator of Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Southampton airports and the broadcast service provider Arqiva. “We didn’t need to convince the regulator,” Bradley said of Macquarie’s return to the UK water industry. “Ofwat has said they’d be keeping a close eye on the situation at Southern Water. They expect us to deliver, and we expect to deliver.” The former Thames employee said that at the end of the day, Macquarie was driven entirely by the bottom line and the letter of Ofwat’s regulation. “They were always in it for the money, and they were able to use the regulatory regime to take an aggressive approach at times,” he said. However, there have been concerns for some time that there has been “underspending in areas that Ofwat didn’t measure” that has led to “an accumulation of problems over decades”. Armstrong said there had already been “quite a lot of change in the regulatory regime since Macquarie was last in the sector”. “Over the last few years we’ve been very clear about making sure there is financial resilience in the sector and that the companies are focused on delivering good operation performance,” she said. Hopefully this time, Ofwat has been clear enough. The regulator can wash its hands of the past only so many times.",News/Business,Misunderstood?

1/31/2022,"Donald Trump’s promise to pardon supporters who attacked the US Capitol on January 6 2021 is “the stuff of dictators”, Richard Nixon’s White House counsel warned.  Trump made the promise at a rally in Conroe, Texas, on Saturday. “If I run and if I win,” he said, referring to the 2024 presidential election, “we will treat those people from January 6 fairly. We will treat them fairly. And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons because they are being treated so unfairly.” More than 700 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol attack, in which Trump supporters tried to stop certification of Trump’s election defeat, in service of his lie that it was caused by electoral fraud. Seven people died. Eleven members of the far-right Oath Keepers militia have been charged with seditious conspiracy. Trump was impeached for inciting the riot with support from 10 House Republicans but acquitted when only seven Republican senators found him guilty. John Dean, 83, was disbarred and detained as a result of the Watergate scandal, which led to Nixon’s resignation in 1974. He responded to Trump on Twitter. “This is beyond being a demagogue to the stuff of dictators,” he wrote. “He is defying the rule of law. “Failure to confront a tyrant only encourages bad behaviour. If thinking Americans don’t understand what Trump is doing and what the criminal justice system must do we are all in big trouble!” Trump was generous with pardons in office, recipients including Steve Bannon and Michael Flynn, both now targets of the House committee investigating January 6. On Sunday morning, the New Hampshire governor Chris Sununu, widely seen as a relative moderate in Trump’s Republican party, was asked if pardons should be offered to Capitol rioters. “Of course not,” he told CNN’s State of the Union. “Oh, my goodness. No.” Others deplored Trump’s words. Richard Painter, a White House ethics counsel under George W Bush, said the promise of pardons should, constitutionally speaking, stop Trump running for a second White House term. “This alone is giving aid or comfort to an insurrection within the meaning of the 14th amendment, section three,” Painter wrote. “Trump is DISQUALIFIED from public office.” Trump also complained about investigations of his business and political affairs which have landed him legal jeopardy. He urged supporters to protest. “If these radical, vicious, racist prosecutors do anything wrong or illegal,” he said, “I hope we are going to have in this country the biggest protests we have ever had in Washington DC, in New York, in Atlanta and elsewhere, because our country and our elections are corrupt.” Prosecutors, he said, were “trying to put me in jail. These prosecutors are vicious, horrible people. They’re racists and they’re very sick. They’re mentally sick. They’re going after me without any protection of my rights by the supreme court or most other courts.” Glenn Kirschner, a former federal prosecutor now a legal anaylst for NBC, said: “Trump is not only encouraging his supporters to violence if he’s arrest[ed], he’s also signaling that he’ll pardon them, just as he’ll pardon the [6 January] insurrectionists. “Will this finally move prosecutors to hold him accountable for his crimes?”",News/US news,Nixon aide: Trump pardon promise for Capitol rioters is ‘stuff of dictators’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/30/trump-pardon-promise-capitol-rioters-dictators-john-dean-nixon
1/31/2022,"Australia has distributed 18m doses of Covid-19 vaccine to neighbouring countries but is being urged to dedicate money and resources to Covax – the global vaccination mechanism – so that the world’s least-inoculated countries can access vaccines. Australia’s “vaccine diplomacy”, focusing on bilateral donations to the Pacific and south-east Asia has come at the expense of commitments to the global Covax facility, to which it has committed zero doses and only $130m.  The Delta variant emerged from highly unvaccinated India, and Omicron from Africa, which has the world’s lowest vaccination rates. With major new variants detected, on average, every four months, there are concerns that persistently laggard vaccination rates in the developing world will allow new variants to keep emerging, sparking new global waves and prolonging the pandemic. Tim Costello, spokesperson for the End Covid for All initiative, said bilateral vaccine donations prioritised a “charity model” over a “justice model” for vaccine access. “The problem with distributing vaccines bilaterally is it becomes a ‘charity model’. It comes out of the rich countries buying five times as many doses as they need, and then looking generous, saying ‘we will donate these to you’. The Covax facility was designed to be a justice model, so that people in poorer countries had equitable access to the vaccination that everybody needs.” End Covid for All has written to the Australian government, calling for an additional $250m to be dedicated to the Covax mechanism, arguing “the global vaccine effort is dangerously off-track, unfair and unjust”. UN data shows while vaccination rates in high-income countries are 67%, the figure is just 11% across low-income countries. Costello told the Guardian nobody would be safe from coronavirus until everybody was. “When the government says ‘I am protecting you, look how many people are vaccinated, soon we will have enough rapid antigen tests’, it is hollow. We in Australia cannot shut ourselves off and protect only ourselves.” The raw numbers of Australia’s vaccine distribution are generous by global standards. Australia has committed to distributing 60m doses of Covid-19 vaccine across the Indo-Pacific by the end of 2022. It has, to 29 January, donated 18,283,000 doses to 16 countries across the Pacific and south-east Asia. Indonesia has received 5.7m doses, Vietnam 5.6m and Cambodia 2.3m. Australia has donated $130m to Covax, an amount that puts it among the very lowest of developed nation donors. Roland Rajah, director of the International Economics Program at the Lowy Institute, said Australia’s vaccine commitments made it the second-most generous per capita donor – behind the US – pledging approximately 2.3 doses internationally per Australian. Australia had also already delivered 30% of its pledged doses, above the global average. “But the reality is when you think about bringing an end to the pandemic – about doing things in an efficient way – there needs to be global equity in vaccine access. Covax prioritises that. The biggest gap is in Africa, which is simply not keeping up in getting shots into people’s arms. And it is largely a supply issue, there needs to be more vaccines going to Africa.” Australia’s focus on the Pacific islands and south-east Asia was geopolitically motivated, and focusing vaccines on countries that already had reasonable rates of protection. Most developed nations, Rajah said, had engaged in some form of vaccine diplomacy, focusing vaccination donations on countries of strategic importance or alliance. But Australia is an outlier in its exclusive bilateral focus, “out of step” with other major global donors. “The only other major donor displaying a similar pattern of bilateral vaccine diplomacy is China, which shares none of its vaccine doses via Covax and has contributed relatively little financially to the facility.” Bilateral vaccine donations are, Rajah said, “not as good”. “It is more in line with vaccine diplomacy and playing politics than it is focused on equity. It is also less efficient. And, when we are trying to end a global pandemic, equity and efficiency are what we need.” There are concerns, too, that if new variants do emerge from largely unvaccinated populations in developing countries, wealthy countries will prioritise their vaccination supplies to provide boosters for their own populations, further exacerbating the global inequality and, ultimately, prolonging the pandemic. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said: “Australia’s commitment to our region’s resilience against the global Covid-19 pandemic remains steadfast.” It said Australia’s vaccine support for the region was “end-to-end”, strengthening local health systems to deliver vaccines to those who need them most, and addressing vaccine hesitancy in places where uptake of vaccines is low, such as Papua New Guinea. “Australia will continue to provide practical and timely support for our neighbours in the Indo-Pacific region to save lives, advance economic recovery, and build health systems to protect against future pandemics.” The director of the Burnet Institute, Professor Brendan Crabb, said on average a major new variant of Covid-19 has been detected every four months since the World Health Organisation characterised it as a pandemic. “Alpha emerged in an – at the time – unvaccinated UK, Delta emerged in a largely unvaccinated India, and Omicron emerged in a largely unvaccinated South Africa. Another variant of concern will no doubt arise unless we ramp up global vaccination efforts.” After a slow start to distribution, the Covax facility has distributed more than 1bn doses across 144 countries, out of 2.8bn doses that have been pledged. Crabb said while “Covax may not be perfect”, it offered an end-to-end vaccine program tailored to each country, working to ensure vaccines that are delivered ultimately find their way into people’s arms. “Widespread vaccination is the central pillar of the plan to reduce the global Covid burden, which is essential to ending the Covid pandemic for us all. And Covax is our best shot at vaccinating the world.”",News/Australia news,Australia urged to spend more on Covax program amid criticisms of ‘vaccine diplomacy’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/31/australia-urged-to-spend-more-on-covax-program-amid-criticisms-of-vaccine-diplomacy
1/31/2022,"Health officials in New South Wales warned vaccines “may be less effective” against the Omicron variant and could lead to an increase in hospitalisations, just days before premier Dominic Perrottet announced Covid-19 restrictions would be scrapped. On 10 December, NSW Health’s Covid-19 critical intelligence unit published a briefing note on what was then the emerging Omicron variant, which had been discovered in South Africa in late November.  Based on emerging data at the time, the unit warned of early evidence suggesting that vaccines could be less effective against the strain, and of “enhanced transmissibility” which suggested Omicron had a “substantial growth advantage over Delta”. It also flagged preliminary evidence suggesting “an increased risk of reinfection” from the variant, and pointed to increased hospitalisation rates in the Gauteng province of South Africa. The note was published as Covid-19 case numbers began to surge following the arrival of the first case of the Omicron variant in late November. When the critical intelligence unit published the note on 10 December, NSW recorded more than 500 daily cases for the first time in two months. A week later the figure had more than tripled. Despite that, the NSW government pushed ahead with its decision to ease restrictions introduced during the long Delta-wave of infections. On 15 December the government announced masks would no longer be mandatory at most locations indoors, scrapped the use of QR code check-ins for low-risk venues and dropped density limits. The NSW opposition leader, Chris Minns, said the fact the document had been published just days before restrictions were loosened an “extraordinary revelation”. “This is clear evidence that the department of health was briefing the NSW government about the emerging risks of Omicron at least five days before the premier dropped the mask mandate, density limits, proof of vaccination and QR check-ins,” he said. “It was early days of Omicron but clearly the experts warned that caution was needed. Instead Mr Perrottet decided to ignore the emerging threat and all related advice. “Ignoring this health advice has had major real-world consequences, for the health system, our frontline workers, and to businesses and families.” In a statement, a spokesperson for Perrottet did not respond directly to questions about whether the briefing note was included in NSW Health advice given to the premier prior to easing restrictions on 15 December. “The NSW government’s top priority is and always has been the health and safety of our people,” a spokesman for Perrottet said. “The government carefully considers the health advice and also weighs up a range of other important factors before making its decisions including operational demands on the health system. “Throughout the Omicron wave, and over the past two years, our government has tailored the settings as the situation evolved to keep the community safe and ensure those who need care can access it.” The premier has repeatedly defended the decision to push ahead with the re-opening in the face of Omicron’s arrival as necessary for the state to begin living with Covid-19. He has continually pointed to hospitalisations and ICU presentations remaining well within the capacity limits outlined by NSW Health, and pointed to the fact that NSW has adopted restrictions similar to neighbouring Victoria and Queensland. “We’re not going our own way in NSW, we are following the national plan with every other state along the eastern seaboard,” he said last week. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But Minns pointed to the fact Perrottet subsequently re-introduced the restrictions on 23 December as the number of health workers furloughed either by illness or isolation requirements rose into the thousands as evidence it was a “mistake”. “It was a case of closing the gate after the horse had bolted,” he said. “And it was one thing to completely ignore the health advice, it was another to fail to plan for the inevitable consequences.” While the Guardian has previously reported the decision to scrap QR check-ins at low risk venues was recommended by NSW Health, Perrottet has previously refused to say whether the state’s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, supported removing the mask mandate. When the decision was made on 15 December Chant said only that it was a “matter for government” and that she was “strongly recommending we keep masks”. But the briefing document, which was published online but went unreported before being overwritten by an updated brief in January, suggests NSW Health was aware the Omicron variant was likely to present a significant challenge to the state’s hospital system. The 10 December briefing note was provided as an overview of emerging information on the new variant and collated data from the experiences of a number of countries as well as advice from the World Health Organization. The note advised that while studies were still under way to understand how effective vaccines would be at suppressing Omicron, it said there were “early indications that fully vaccinated people are protected against the Omicron variant”. “However, the protection may be less effective,” the note warned. “There are early reports of breakthrough infections in South Africa among people who have received any of the three kinds of vaccines in use in that country (Johnson & Johnson, Comirnaty and Vaxzervia). “Preliminary data presented at a briefing hosted by South Africa’s Department of Health suggests some mutations may be associated with increased antibody resistance [and] Moderna’s CEO says current Covid-19 vaccines are likely to be less effective against Omicron.” While significant data has now emerged linking Omicron with milder symptoms than other previous strains of the virus, on 10 December the briefing warned that it wasn’t yet clear “whether Omicron causes more severe disease” and warned that it had led to increasing hospitalisation rates overseas. “Early reports suggest increasing rates of hospitalisation in South Africa; however, this may be due to overall increasing rates of infection, and not a signal of more severe disease,” it stated. It also noted the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control had rated the risk of the emergence and spread of Omicron as “high to very high” and warned the mutations observed in Omicron were “associated with enhanced transmissibility”. While briefings are not an endorsed position of NSW Health, the critical intelligence unit was established to provide “rapid, evidence-based insights” on emerging Covid-19 trends. It sits within the Agency of Clinical Information, and provides high level summaries of studies and evidence, which it regularly updates and publishes. In an updated note on 27 January the critical intelligence unit pointed to data from a number of countries suggesting people infected with the Omicron variant are less likely to require hospitalisation compared with Delta, and that the overall stay for those who did require hospital treatment was shorter.",News/Australia news,NSW government was warned Omicron could lead to more hospitalisations days before restrictions lifted,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/31/nsw-government-was-warned-omicron-could-lead-to-more-hospitalisations-days-before-restrictions-lifted
1/31/2022,"Women experiencing financial hardship or stress because of the pandemic are up to three times more likely to be sexually or physically abused by their partners, new research shows. Female breadwinners are also more likely to experience abuse, the Australian report found, pointing to previous research that has argued the relationship between economic disparity and intimate partner violence “is a consequence of attitudes that support traditional gender norms and hegemonic masculinities”.  Australia’s National Research Organisation for Women’s Safety (Anrows) surveyed 10,000 women to investigate links between economic insecurity and intimate partner violence during the Covid-19 pandemic. It found “clear evidence” that economic stressors were associated with both the onset and the escalation of abuse. This was true for women whose partners had not previously been violent to them, suggesting the financial stress contributed to the violence, as opposed to stress being the consequence of the abusive relationship. The authors, Anthony Morgan and Dr Hayley Boxall, from the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC), found one in three women surveyed suffered at least one form of economic hardship (defined as an “inability to pay for essential household expenses because of a shortage of money”) during the pandemic. Previous research has shown women were more likely to lose their jobs or have precarious work situations during the pandemic. Women with higher levels of financial stress who hadn’t already experienced violence “were much more likely to have experienced physical and sexual violence or emotionally abusive, harassing and controlling behaviours relative to women who reported low levels of financial stress in the last 12 months”, the authors wrote. “Women who were the main income earner in the relationship were more likely than women who were not the main income earner to have experienced physical violence, sexual violence and emotionally abusive, harassing and controlling behaviours. “Specifically, respondents who said that they could find $2,000 within a week in an emergency, but that their partner could not, were significantly more likely than respondents in relationships where neither partner could obtain the money to have experienced sexual violence and emotionally abusive, harassing and controlling behaviours.” The authors found the opposite was also true, that women whose partner would be able to obtain $2,000 in an emergency, but they could not, were also more likely to experience abuse. Employed women with unemployed partners were also more likely to experience all forms of intimate partner violence. Women with more economic power could be seen as a threat to “gender norms”, the authors wrote, with men turning to abuse to “reaffirm their notion of themselves as masculine”. They said previous research had found “men may use violence as a means of establishing control within their relationships, and mitigating any feelings of inadequacy they may have”. When men had the economic power, women’s dependence was a barrier to leaving an abusive relationship or seeking help. According to the survey results, women who were the main income earners had 1.7 times higher odds of experiencing physical violence, 1.6 times the odds of sexual violence and 1.5 times the odds of non-physical violence. Women experiencing high financial stress were three times as likely to experience physical or sexual abuse and 2.6 times more likely to experience non-physical abuse. Ninety-five per cent of those surveyed had a male partner. The researchers found there was an increased risk for women with health conditions, or who’d been pregnant in the past year, or living with children, or Indigenous women. The AIC deputy director, Dr Rick Brown, said the results suggest that some abusers “may be using sexual violence as a way of exerting control over their partner that they feel they have lost or is being challenged in other areas”. Padma Raman, the Anrows chief executive officer, said strategies to address “harmful attitudes supporting gender norms” and to “dismantle systems that enable these problematic attitudes” were needed alongside responses to improve women’s economic security. Stable housing, income support, debt forgiveness, microloans and access to affordable childcare were among the sorts of support needed. The women’s safety minister, Anne Ruston, said the federal government’s draft national plan to end violence against women and children had a “strong focus” on women’s economic security. The government also has a payment of up to $5,000 for survivors leaving violent relationships. “We understand that financial hardship can be a barrier to leaving violent relationships and the new escaping violence payment aims to provide direct financial support to victim-survivors when they make the incredibly brave decision to leave any form of intimate partner violence, including physical violence, coercive control and financial abuse,” she said.

1/31/2022,"There are a hundred reasons why any one of us may struggle to sleep, and there are nearly as many remedies to match. Without wanting to sound like a snake oil salesperson, I have found one small change that all of us could make, that truly works: a short stretch before bed. Studies have shown that low level physical activity and meditation practice that use gentle stretching like yoga or tai chi, can help with sleep quality. And while it is good to stretch at anytime of day, establishing a gentle and quiet routine before bed can help send a signal to the brain that it is now time for sleep.  Best of all, stretching doesn’t require money. There are plenty of exercise and stretching apps you could buy or subscribe to that will have routines you can follow. I have found that the subscription-based apps Sweat and Centr have good, short routines (under 10 minutes) with clear instructions to improve your form. But we’re post lockdowns now and there is a veritable platoon of personal trainers and yoga instructors on YouTube who have been giving away their classes for free to people stuck at home. Yoga with Adriene is the best known, with a huge library of videos available, but I also enjoy Zanna van Dijk’s relaxed and low-key stretches. There are plenty of others that offer routines specifically aimed at bedtime too. If you’d rather perfect your technique in person, you can also find free yoga and tai chi lessons in your local community – most of Australia’s major cities offer some in parks or public areas like Melbourne’s Federation Square – and take those lessons home. What works for you will depend on your current physical state. I am a 30-year-old who hunches over her computer for too many hours a day, and I have been to yoga classes with women in their 80s who could do a cartwheel over my poor, suffering body. But if you struggle with mobility, there are things like chair yoga to try. So clearly I’m no expert, but I have been stretching right before bed since the pandemic began and have found that I always sleep better on the nights that I do it. Whatever your ability, the key is to start gently and work your way up – because the best thing about stretching is that you see great returns quite quickly, as long as you do it routinely. And how better to establish a routine than doing your stretches just before something you do every day? Sleep well.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Easy wins: want to sleep better?

1/31/2022,"The number of new electric vehicles in Australia has tripled after years of lagging sales, off the back of incentives introduced by state governments to support their uptake. Australia recorded 24,078 EV sales in 2021, a significant increase from the 6,900 sold in 2020, which means electric cars now make up 2.39% of the new car market.  The Tesla Model 3 was the bestselling electric car in Australia, with 15,054 vehicles sold last year – accounting for 62.5% of all EVs sold. It was followed by the MG ZS with 1,388 and the Mitsubishi Outlander with 592.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The sales figures now include the number of cars sold by Tesla in Australia after a deal was struck between the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) and the US company. In previous years Tesla refused to release a breakdown of figures by region, instead releasing only total global sales figures. The company delivered 936,172 electric cars worldwide in 2021. In the past, industry bodies that monitor changes in the car market have been forced to make informed estimates, but Tesla’s regional breakdown reveals the number of electric vehicles on Australian roads. The EVC chief executive, Behyad Jafari, said the sales figures represent a milestone in a market where EV sales have lagged for years because of mixed signals from government, especially compared with other parts of the world. “We’ve been waiting for quite a few years to hit the 1% mark, so to skip that and go straight to 2% is a big deal,” Jafari said. He said the boost can be attributed the mix of supportive policies introduced by individual states and territories designed to support uptake, including stamp duty waivers and rebates. Though there had been solid growth in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, with market share hovering around the national average, the Australian Capital Territory – which is widely considered to have introduced the most generous policies in the country – has consistently outperformed every other jurisdiction with a market share of 5.87%, Even with the positive numbers, Jafari said there is still more that could be done provided there is federal government support. “There’s no reason why we shouldn’t be up to 20% already,” Jafari said. “We have a federal government talking about hitting those targets by 2030 when really we could be there today. It’s just a matter of them doing their jobs.” Even at 2.39% of the market, electric vehicle sales in Australia lag behind other countries. Electric vehicles make up 11.2% of the market in western Europe, according to data from Schmidt Automotive Research, with registrations for battery electric vehicles surpassing those for diesel for the first time in December last year. Though the US is also considered to be behind the curve, , electric cars account for roughly 3% of the new car market – still greater than in Australia But with demand in the US and other countries expected to take off in 2022, Australian companies in the supply chain are already looking overseas for opportunities. Brisbane-based company Tritium, a manufacturer of electric vehicle fast charging systems, is expected to announce the site of its new US factory in coming weeks, with plans for it to be operational by September. The company’s share price closed at US$7.74 on Wednesday after it successfully listed on the Nasdaq this week, earning the company’s longtime backer Trevor St Baker A$344.7m for his 31.5m shares. Its Brisbane facility is currently able to manufacture 5,000 units a year and the new factory would triple the company’s capacity without the need to ship material overseas.

1/31/2022,"Bernard Collaery’s case has taken many twists and turns in the almost four years since he was charged. The latest chapter in the protracted, convoluted prosecution has seen the government launch proceedings in the high court.  But the story remains critically important to understand, particularly at a time when so many Australian whistleblowers are under threat, and secrecy is becoming increasingly pervasive across all aspects of government. At the heart of the current Collaery proceedings is a tension between transparency and open justice, on the one hand, and national security and secrecy on the other. With that in mind, let’s break down where the case is up to. In a nutshell, Collaery, a barrister, and his client Witness K, a former intelligence officer, were charged over their role in exposing a 2004 espionage mission against Australia’s ally Timor-Leste. Australia bugged the offices of the young nation to give itself an advantage during commercial negotiations to carve up the resource-rich Timor Sea, which a range of major oil and gas corporates, led by Woodside, wanted to exploit. Witness K, a long-serving member of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, had become disillusioned and questioned the mission, which not only targeted an ally for commercial gain, but diverted crucial intelligence resources away from the region at a time of heightened terror threat. Both Witness K and Collaery helped Timor-Leste build a case against Australia in the international courts, arguing the treaty they struck over the Timor Sea was void, because Australia had spied and not negotiated in good faith. Collaery also spoke publicly about the case. The government held off approving a prosecution against them until 2018, just after Timor-Leste and Australia had signed a new treaty. They were then both charged with disclosing protected intelligence information, an allegation Collaery is fighting at trial in the ACT supreme court. The case against Collaery has dragged on interminably. Four long years have passed since charges were laid, and we still have no trial in sight. The government believes significant parts of the trial must be held behind closed doors to protect Australia’s national security. That creates an unavoidable tension with the need for open justice, a founding principle of Australia’s courts system. It’s this tension that accounts for much of the delay to this point. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The federal attorney general has sought to invoke the National Security Information Act (NSI Act) to force the courts to keep parts of the case secret. Initially at least, the courts agreed with the ACT supreme court ruling in the attorney general’s favour and ordering significant parts of the trial be kept from the public. But Collaery won a major victory for open justice in the ACT court of appeal last year, overturning the earlier decision. The court of appeal ruled that the secrecy posed a “very real risk of damage to public confidence” and cited the importance of open justice in preventing “political prosecutions”. But it also left the door open for the government to go back to the ACT supreme court and show it new evidence about the potential risks of not suppressing parts of the trial. The parties are still arguing about how, and if, the court should accept this new evidence. Well, when the ACT court of appeal delivered that win for Collaery last year, it held off on publishing its full judgment. The government believed that publishing the judgment in full would pose a risk to national security. Yes, that old chestnut. The attorney general asked chief justice Helen Murrell to suppress parts of the reasons. She kindly declined and said she intended to publish the court’s reasons in full. Remarkably, the government then asked the high court for special leave to appeal against that decision. Take a moment to consider that. The Australian government is asking the country’s highest court to suppress parts of a ruling that ordered Collaery’s trial should not be held in secret.

Strangely, it has decided not to give the high court a copy of the unredacted judgment so it can see for itself. The government also argues that the judgment should not be published before the ACT supreme court has resolved the issue we mentioned earlier, namely whether it should hear new evidence from the government about the changes to the national security environment that make the open hearing of Collaery’s case a risk. The Human Rights Law Centre senior lawyer Kieran Pender has described the high court bid as “perverse”. “The attorney general’s continued pursuit of secrecy in this case is a damning indictment of the Morrison government’s priorities,” he said. “Rather than enacting long-overdue reform to whistleblowing laws, the government has gone to the high court to keep parts of a court judgment that said no to a secret trial itself secret.” We’ve only just obtained Collaery’s submissions to the high court. In them, his lawyers describe the government’s argument that the judge erred in deciding to publish the judgment as “without foundation”. “The Attorney-General here bases her application for special leave to appeal expressly upon the proposition that disclosure of the reasons for decision of the Court of Appeal in the Primary Judgment, as redacted by her Honour the Chief Justice, would reveal national security information that is protected by the certificate, and that such information should not be revealed in circumstances in which the remittal question is not yet resolved. “The propositions are directly inconsistent with the approach of her honour the chief justice, the assertion of error in the exercise of discretion is without evidence, and the application for special leave is without foundation.” The high court will first need to decide whether it needs to hear the case about publishing the judgment. If it does, we could be waiting on a high court hearing and judgment for some time. In the meantime, the ACT supreme court is still grappling with whether it should accept new evidence from the government on new risks posed to national security by hearing all of Collaery’s case openly. The government is saying, in effect, that the circumstances affecting Australia’s national security have shifted considerably since the case was first brought. That means the court needs to consider new potential implications of holding Collaery’s case in public, the government says. It is also arguing it should be able to present this new evidence in a super secret form, denying Collaery the chance to see it. If this happens, only the judge would be able to view this new evidence the government says justifies keeping the trial partly closed to the public. Collaery has warned that allowing the government to do this risks creating a never-ending cycle, where the delays in the case are used as an excuse to present new evidence of the need for secrecy, which delay the case again. The supreme court judge David Mossop expressed a similar concern last year. “Is there any prospect of this matter ever being completed? Or will we be stuck in a perpetual vortex of updating?” he said.",News/Australia news,Open justice v secrecy: what is the case against Witness K lawyer Bernard Collaery all about?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/31/open-justice-v-secrecy-what-is-the-case-against-witness-k-lawyer-bernard-collaery-all-about
1/31/2022,"GWS player Haneen Zreika’s decision not to wear the club’s Pride round jumper and therefore not play in round four of the AFLW has brought rise to much debate around the concept of “inclusion”. For a long time sport and AFLW specifically has elevated conversations about inclusion and diversity, but what does that really mean?Embracing “diversity” necessitates the coexistence of different experiences, beliefs, practices and cultures. The concept of “inclusion” is often described as the ways in which we make our diversity work together. To me, inclusion is respect. Not always agreement, but a functional respect for one another.  By all accounts that is what GWS has achieved, and this moment has provided the perfect litmus test. Had the team not cultivated an environment of inclusivity, understanding and respect, Zreika would not have been able to have this very complex conversation with her teammates. Her teammates would not have accepted her difference. They would not have come to a resolution that, perhaps difficult on all sides, was largely workable for the collective. The long term effects will tell us how deep their culture of respect and inclusion goes, but so far, the signs are good. No doubt there are LGBTQ+ identifying staff and players who would have found Zreika’s refusal to wear the Pride jumper hurtful, but they accepted her choice not to. The public’s reaction however has been varied. Some have likened Zreika to Israel Folau and Margaret Court. Zreika’s own words tell us they are vastly different. In a statement released late on Friday afternoon, Zreika called for kindness, saying inclusion was about respecting people’s choices “as long as they don’t advocate for hate and division”. By contrast, Folau and Court have very publicly and purposefully spoken out against LGBTQ+ people. In 2019 Folau posted on social media claiming “hell awaits” gay people and has linked the Australian bushfires of 2019 with the legalisation of same sex marriage and abortion. Similarly Court has spoken out publicly in her role as a Pentecostal minister opposing same-sex marriage and condemning transgender athletes. In 2013, Court wrote a letter to a newspaper taking aim at the birth of Australian tennis player Casey Dellacqua’s child in a same-sex relationship. Zreika’s actions were to opt out of an active, performative allyship, out of respect for her faith, her community and the diverse views amongst them. Perhaps GWS and Zreika’s one misstep was to underestimate the public response to what they presumably thought would be a quiet process of stepping aside, with any hope of avoiding a distraction from the celebrations gone. There is a temptation to reduce this incident to a simplistic narrative of religious extremism versus liberal left politics. However, what we have been presented with is a real life playing out of the complexity of lived experience and intersectionality. Zreika’s very existence in AFLW as the only Muslim woman playing is a disruption on multiple levels, both within her own communities and in the very white, male AFL landscape. To make a 21-year-old woman of colour the lightning rod for yet another conversation about representation and inclusivity is unreasonable and unfair. It seems Zreika’s teammates are willing to hold judgement. Understanding that they cannot comprehend her lived experience, and trusting her explanation, they are ready to move on. Perhaps we as a public need to take their lead. For Fahad Ali, a gay organiser in the Muslim community, the issue is largely clear and deeply personal. “There are legitimate reasons for why Haneen may feel like she cannot participate, and not all of them relate to prejudice… Demanding perfection from the people you tokenise is another way of saying that you don’t want any of us at all.” Still, for many the question lingers: does opting out mean opposition? As someone whose job it is to lead conversations on inclusion, I have a growing unease in which sport in particular frames these conversations. The rise of symbolic and performative allyship has eclipsed what I would call “the real work”. The visibility of marginalised communities is important, no doubt. However sport now asks us to understand inclusion through the prism of themed rounds, performative allyship that is coupled with commercially beneficial outcomes. This moment is showing us the limitations of only understanding respect for one another through one’s public performance of it. This brings rise to another question – how will the AFLW handle true inclusion of others outside its own community? AFLW, perceivably built with inclusion at its core, appears to have an issue when it comes to the inclusion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander athletes, trans athletes and culturally diverse communities. For years AFLW fans and athletes alike have been asking the white male monoculture of Australian sport to open its doors to the rest of the community. Is AFLW, with its beginnings rooted in mostly white, lesbian, metro culture, ready to do the same? If so, on what terms? If the game is to grow, it will come up against new cultures, communities and beliefs. How will the league and its supporters welcome these new and very different people? If GWS is an example, the answer is with dignity, a lack of judgement, and with respect at its core.",Sport/Sport,ALFW Pride round jumper debate provides litmus test for true inclusion and diversity,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/31/alfw-pride-round-jumper-debate-provides-litmus-test-for-true-inclusion-and-diversity

But reminders of the pandemic are still here, from masked attendees to signs urging people to social distance. Kim Chi, owner of Huong Giang Kim Hoan Jewellers, is selling hand-crafted paper flower arrangements outside her stop. She says the celebration is a chance for the community to feel like things are going back to normal. “Its not just about selling the flowers, I wanted to make them to create a nice atmosphere, to make everyone feel normal again, so we don’t have to think about the pandemic or Covid for once” she says.

Philips says the festival is both marker of the lunar new year and a chance for local diaspora communities to reconnect with their cultural roots. “As a Vietnamese woman living overseas, it’s a chance for us to feel connected to our roots and our culture, and an opportunity to get together and remind us where we come from, and to hold on to it here in Australia,” she says.

1/31/2022,"Australia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Future Fund, has invested more than $90m in weapons manufacturer Raytheon Technologies, whose laser-guided bomb was allegedly used in an airstrike on a detention centre in Yemen this month killing nearly 100 civilians. Documents released under freedom of information laws show the Future Fund, which invests on behalf of the Australian government, had $91.22m invested in Raytheon as of December last year.  Amnesty International claims that a laser-guided bomb was used in an attack by the Saudi-led coalition on a detention centre in Sa’adah in north-west Yemen on 21 January that killed at least 91 people and injured 200 more. It was described by the UN as “the worst civilian-casualty incident in the last three years in Yemen”. Amnesty International’s arms experts who analysed photographs of the remnants of the weapon used in the attack identified the bomb as a GBU-12, a 500lb laser-guided bomb manufactured by Raytheon. Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, said Yemeni civilians were “paying the terrible price for Western states’ lucrative arms sales to Saudi Arabia and its coalition allies”. “The international community has a responsibility to close the gates to all arms sales that are fuelling the needless suffering of civilians in the armed conflict.” The Future Fund’s investment in weapons manufacturers has attracted significant public and parliamentary scrutiny. In December, a separate FoI request revealed the fund had invested in a Chinese state-controlled arms conglomerate, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, that has sold combat aircraft to the Myanmar military, which is accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Future Fund has more than $157m invested with 14 publicly traded companies that have done business with the Myanmar military. The Future Fund controls about $200bn in investments made on behalf of the Australian government, including investing the superannuation of Australia’s public servants. However, a government bill currently before parliament is seeking to shield the Future Fund from freedom of information requests, exempting the fund from releasing any details about its activities including information about which companies the fund has invested in and how much. The fund has previously argued before a Senate committee that the changes are necessary because of the “administrative burden” associated with complying with requests and because of confidentiality concerns from investment managers it worked with. Rawan Arraf, the executive director of the Australian Centre for International Justice, said the Future Fund was dismissive of efforts to hold it to account and the proposed legislation was an active attempt to undermine transparency around public funds. “The Future Fund must immediately review its entire portfolio and divest from arms companies and those entities aiding and abetting international crimes,” she said. In a speech to the UN Security Council, the chairperson of Yemen’s Mwatana for Human Rights, Radhya al-Mutawakel, said the international community needed to end arm sales to countries “that have a track record of violating human rights law and international humanitarian law”. “Arms-exporting countries have a responsibility on their shoulders, and it is unreasonable to turn a blind eye to their role. “We observed the poor villages that never knew any of the modern technology – no smartphones, no computers – but were targeted by the latest bombs and projectiles dropped by the latest aircraft manufactured in the richest and most urbanised countries.” She told the Guardian: “Instead of investing in the bloody destruction of other communities, Australia must end arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE and support the establishment of an international criminally focused investigative mechanism for Yemen through the UN general assembly.” A spokesperson for the Future Fund said the fund held developed market equities in accordance with global weightings, including companies listed on the New York stock exchange. Raytheon is among the largest 200 companies on that exchange: “These stocks are not selected, they come as part of an index holding.” The spokesperson said the Future Fund “abides by Australian law and observes any sanctions imposed by the Australian government”. “The Australian government has no ban or sanction on these companies. In fact it contracts extensively with them,” pointing out that Raytheon is a contractor to the Australian Defence Force, providing integrated weapons systems and battlefield and satellite communications. The prime minister opened Raytheon’s $50m Centre for Joint Integration in Adelaide last March. Raytheon did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The Saudi-led coalition has denied targeting the detention centre in Sa’adah on 21 January. The ongoing war in Yemen – fought since 2015 between the Yemeni government, supported by a Saudi-led coalition, and Iranian-backed Houthi rebels – has taken a devastating toll on the country’s civilian population. The UN estimates the conflict had killed 377,000 people by the end of 2021, both directly and indirectly through hunger and disease. Violations of international humanitarian law have been committed by both sides of the conflict, observers say. Under international humanitarian law all parties to a conflict have an obligation to protect the lives of civilians, including people who are detained. The deliberate targeting of civilians and extensive, unjustified destruction of property are war crimes. The latest escalation in violence came after strikes by Houthi rebels on Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on 17 January, which killed three people.",News/Australia news,Australia’s Future Fund has invested over $90m in weapons manufacturer Raytheon,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/31/australias-future-fund-has-invested-over-90m-in-weapons-manufacturer-raytheon
1/31/2022,"Iwas trembling. Not because I was about to do something risky or scary – quite the opposite. This was a situation I had been in many times before, but I was nervous about what was going to happen next. I was on the Concert Hall stage at the Sydney Opera House looking at an audience of about 2,000 people. Not to perform music, thankfully. I’d been invited to speak about why Australia should abolish its private schools. Typical symptoms of performance anxiety include dry mouth, sweaty hands, trembling knees and racing heartbeat – I experienced all these and more. Even my vision had changed thanks to the bright spotlights turned towards me.  Standing alone, I caught sight of the beautiful white birch panelling of the Concert Hall’s interior. It reminded me of my home country. For the Finns, the birch is a sacred tree. Birch trees play an important part in the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic. Suddenly I felt more comfortable. It was time to do what I’d come to do – to tell the audience why Finnish parents don’t ever need to worry about finding a good school or paying for their children’s education, and why Australians wouldn’t need to do so either if they didn’t want to. Imagine that. This episode happened in September 2012 during my second visit to Australia. I’d enjoyed many conversations and debates with Australians over the years, but that day at the Opera House became my most memorable public talk to that point. It still is the highlight of my working life. Six years later I returned to Sydney with my wife, our two young boys and six large suitcases. Sydney would be our next hometown after living in Finland, Croatia, Italy and the US. Our boys had gone to kindergarten in Helsinki and both my wife and I worked on education issues in Finland and internationally. You may consider us an education family. We certainly considered our new home to be an education nation. Its schools and teachers are admired by students and educators overseas, and I had met scores of Australians who speak to and teach others about education and how to make it better. Not so long ago, Australian education was highly ranked internationally. But that is not so any longer. One reason I had moved to Sydney was to join a group of colleagues and educators to figure out how to fix that situation. The first thing my wife and I realised was that there is a wide range of all sorts of schools, especially in Australia’s urban areas, so that parents can choose the right one. As a newly arrived family, our first task was to find schools for our boys: a primary school for our older son and a preschool for the younger. Back home the solution would have been a no-brainer: the nearest neighbourhood school or kindergarten in Helsinki. Private schools don’t exist in Finland: most children attend their nearest public school. Which means that parents never pay for their children’s school education, never drive their kids to school nor pack lunchboxes every morning while worrying whether they can provide enough good food to keep their kids going through the day. In Sydney, everything was different. Most early childhood education providers in our neighbourhood promised innovative programs to teach early reading and maths so that our son would be prepared and ready to go to kindy at the age of five, whereas in Helsinki, children in early childhood education are allowed to develop and learn at their own pace and start primary school at the age of seven. Finnish schools are expected to be ready to welcome all children as they are rather than expecting them to be ready for school. The price of what was on offer in Sydney was far beyond what we could afford. Daily fees for early childhood education and care were about the same as we’d paid in Helsinki for a month. And so we did what so many other Australian parents do – wait a year until the public kindy would become an option for our youngest boy. Australian public primary schools still serve families and children in their own communities. As in Finland, Australian children have the right to attend a public school in their own neighbourhood. But things are changing thanks to evolving supplies and demands. Today over 30% of Australia’s primary school children choose not to use that right, instead attending one of the many independent schools that are increasingly available – especially in cities and larger towns. “Which school did you choose for your boys?” So many new colleagues and friends asked me this before we had even arrived. Given that I think school is an essential part of building a strong and cohesive local community, our boys attend the local public school. Sometimes I tell those curious about this that I am doing a social experiment with my own children by sending them to a public school in Sydney and then writing a piece about it. But frankly, I don’t need further evidence to know the public school down the road is the best option for my boys. In pursuit of excellence, an odd dogma has become common in Australian education policy across the past two decades: if education could only act more like a marketplace, excellence would prevail. Emphasis on school choice and the subsequent competition between schools isn’t a homegrown Australian idea; it’s been influenced by the global education reform movement dominant in the UK and the US since the 1990s. But it seems like Australia has stronger faith in the power of a marketplace than many other countries. Public policies at federal and state levels encourage parental choice in pursuit of individual educational excellence by offering attractive financial support to non-government schools. Go figure. During the past decade, according to the 2021 Report on Government Services, combined commonwealth and state government funding for private schools increased by more than six times that for public schools. At the same time, private school fees have tripled since 2000. As a result, the proportion of students in government schools has declined and the independent school sector has been slowly growing. Everybody wants to be excellent. Schools pursue excellence, and parents seek excellent education for their children. Consumers in the marketplace are happy when they get bang for their buck. The 2021 Australia Talks National Survey found that 92% of parents at independent schools were satisfied with the education their child was receiving. And yet research shows that public schools do as well as private schools after differences in students’ socio-economic backgrounds are considered. But happy clientele in the education marketplace doesn’t guarantee a good education for every child. The cost of the pursuit of individual excellence in Australian education – rather than a systemic excellence that would provide high-quality education for all – has been gradually eroding equity of education. As is often reported, many international organisations, including Unicef and the OECD, rate Australian education as unequal and highly segregated, leaving too many children behind. At the same time, the overall average performance of Australian students compared with their peers in other countries has been slipping during the past two decades. When colleagues overseas ask what I think about Australia’s school system, I tell them that it does offer world-class education, but not for everyone. I have seen thousands of schools around the world. But some of the best schools I’ve found are here. Why, then, is our educational performance not what it used to be just two decades ago? The main problem, as I see it, is neither curriculum, quality of teachers nor leadership in schools. It lies elsewhere. And understanding that problem is key to better education – not just for some but for the entire nation. To borrow (possibly apocryphal) inspiration from Albert Einstein: if I had an hour to solve Australia’s education problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions. Einstein is also claimed to have said that no problem can be solved from the same consciousness that created it. In other words, we need a new way of thinking. We have one of the world’s most examined, researched and reviewed school systems, but when it comes to taking the evidence and respective recommendations seriously, we find ourselves in the same old debates and confrontations over and again. As international experts have reminded Australia’s education system leaders, we have now lost a decade due to inability to learn from ourselves and from others about how to build a more equitable school system for all children. Education is a complex social system, and complex systems are not easy to understand. Not necessarily because they are structurally complicated – complex systems often have simple design – but because the interaction between their parts is unpredictable. Sydney has a concrete example of such simple complexity: the Opera House, which is among the most fascinating buildings of the twentieth century. Its ingenuity is in its simplicity, yet it was extremely complex to construct. Look at the Opera House carefully, and you’ll see fundamental design principles inspired by organic nature and experiential character, or form and function: simple complexity. In this respect, the Sydney Opera House and a racing bicycle have one thing in common: remove a part, and it won’t work as it was designed anymore. As I see it, the Opera House represents a metaphor for a modern education system. The Finnish education system is a Nordic design, with simple and practical form and function. Compared with Australia’s education system, it looks deceptively simple when the core purpose is exposed: the learning, wellbeing and happiness of all children for common good. Many have tried to discover the secret of Finland’s school system, but very few have succeeded. The secret lies in its design. So let’s start with a design question: what is the leading idea in education system design? Today two of three Australian schools are public. Alongside these public schools – which cater to over 80% of Indigenous students, disadvantaged children and children with greater special educational needs – a privately managed, fee-charging and largely government-funded school sector has been steadily growing for two decades. From the system design point of view, this hybrid system sees schools operate under a wide range of regulations, funded jointly by parents and two separate levels of government using fiscal arrangements that are hard to understand – even for experienced education-system leaders. In this respect, the Australian school system is an outlier among other advanced nations. At the outset the Australian education sector looks like a marketplace, evolved on the assumption that parental choice is the best driver of whole-system improvement, just as consumer choice works in a real marketplace by pulling prices down and lifting quality up. Therefore, insisting on parents’ freedom to choose their children’s education facilitates the opening of new kinds of schools and encourages “healthy” competition among schools to better serve families’ diverse individual needs. Market mentality also dominates politicians’ responses to parents’ concerns about quality of education. In January 2020 the then-federal minister of education Dan Tehan urged unhappy parents to “shop around” to ensure they get good value for money. That Australian educational performance shows no sign of improving despite continuous national recommendations and international advice demonstrates that school systems have a design error that increases inequity across both the public and private schooling sectors. An inconvenient truth is that significant financial resources added to education from both state and federal budgets have not made Australian education any fairer. This is linked to the second dimension of the challenge: the structural problem of Australian education. Many other education systems suffer from structural failures – I have worked with several governments around the world in this space. Using an international lens offers a comparative perspective that is often helpful. In the big picture Australian education is an outlier also in a sense that schools in different parts of the country are more socially segregated than in most other rich countries. Currently, Australia’s school system concentrates disadvantaged students in disadvantaged schools (that is: where more than half of students come from disadvantaged homes), which has unintended implications for student learning. Much political and public debate focuses on excellence. And Naplan has been held up as the basic driver of improved educational excellence since 2008, annually testing the basic knowledge of all year 3, 5, 7 and 9 students and linking their scores to public school scorecards through the My School website. Naplan has been researched and reviewed and a constant topic of public and professional debates since its inauguration. And, against initial expectations, research has found convincing domestic and international evidence that too strong a focus on externally determined and narrow academic learning outcomes is associated with deteriorating performance. What’s lost in these debates is a sharper focus on equity and its linear relationship with excellence. The main finding is this: there can be no national educational excellence without stronger equity of outcomes. Australia should accept – as many nations acknowledged a decade ago – that equity and excellence are inseparable. What’s surprising is that there are still some people who refuse to accept that educational equity is something to worry about. It is paramount to understanding the state of education that we see education as a system of interrelated elements. When we fail to see it this way, we often also fail to understand why it doesn’t work as well as it should. Rather than ask whether the system’s design and structure are adequate to produce expected outcomes (say, excellence and equity) when we consider stagnated or declining school systems performance and student learning, we pay attention to those who work on the frontline of schooling – teachers and principals. Perhaps teachers are not prepared to teach well enough? Maybe the curriculum is outdated? What if the problem is that we don’t have enough data about how teachers teach and what students learn? These and other similar questions distract from broader structural aspects that need reform. Consequently, Australia’s education system has latterly evolved in a piecemeal fashion, with frequent fragmented education reforms adding new layers to the work of schools without removing any unnecessary functions. Let me be clear. Of course it is necessary to upgrade education by improving its integral parts. We need to fix problems related to the teaching profession, including teachers’ workload, teaching conditions and remuneration. We must redesign curriculum systems so that all Australian children better understand the world around them and their own potential. And high-quality early childhood education and care must be accessible to all children before they go to school. These and other measures are all necessary – but they are not enough to guarantee each and every child a fair go. So if the problem is more about the system’s design and structure than fixing its parts, what should be done next? First and foremost, we need a genuinely wide and majority consensus (and understanding) that the current structure should be redesigned so that policies and practices can be created to reduce prevalent inequities. Our complicated hybrid system is an offspring of an inherited colonial education model and a cocktail of more recent and haphazard reforms in the 21st century that were mandated without considering the commonly agreed purpose of schooling. This is a global phenomenon. When new governments take office, new education reforms often follow. Only states with less politicised education systems and more sustainable political systems – such as Finland – have the luxury of not responding this way. Where education is overly politicised, governments often want to leave their mark by rushing to introduce education reforms without deeper contemplation of their possible side effects. Instead of making schools better, teachers are asked to do more on top of all their previous duties. Through this, Australian schools have become crowded places – like a Christmas tree decorated to the point that we can’t see the tree anymore. In principle, fixing Australian education is not that difficult, and there have even been moments in the past when this could have happened. I first visited Australia in 2012. That February, just minutes before boarding my flight to Melbourne, I received an email from an Australian colleague. Attached was the 300-page document now known as the Gonski review, released to the public that very day. My maiden trip to Australia couldn’t have started more optimistically. The purpose of that trip was to meet with state and territory education-system leaders, speak to teachers about international trends in education and address politicians at Parliament House in Canberra. The newspaper I bought at Melbourne airport had this headline: “Surplus before schools as Gonski report decries student advantage”. If Australia followed Gonski’s recommendations, I concluded, it would be on a good course towards realising the goals of the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians (2008). A decade has passed since the Gonski review, and its recommendations – never fully implemented – are now part of history. Much of the momentum to make those sorely needed structural changes, especially regarding funding, was watered down by political speculations and ideological confrontations. Education reforms continued to ignore evidence from abroad and research from Australian scholars. Many educators were left disappointed and some remain upset, for good reason. Somehow it feels that we are back to square one. Disappointment has gradually turned into frustration: is it really true that the Australian education sector can’t be changed? Much of the rest of the world has now chosen different directions and some countries are making early progress, such as Scotland, Sweden and some American states. Can Australia change course before it’s too late? The simple solution requires us to stop doing things that are not linked to improved teaching and learning. Keeping consequential school accountability, standardised testing and a narrow focus on academic curriculum in the driver’s seat of education policy is not just unnecessary, it’s also harmful to building the professional trust in teachers and schools that is one condition for moving forward. More complicated, but equally crucial, is to accomplish bipartisan political consensus on the values and principles upon which school education is based. This includes a shared understanding of the purpose of education and how it serves to create a stronger national sense of “common good”. This is not a radical ask. All high-performing education systems have succeeded not because one side won an ideological confrontation but because all have reached out to one another for agreement. Too often, political decisions fail to address that “common good” in favour of privileges for some. Back to the Sydney Opera House. The idea of this place being designed by a Danish architect was hard for many Australians to accept. Construction was an engineering nightmare: nothing like this had been built before. The final cost was more than 10 times the original estimate, and many people thought the whole project was ridiculous and unnecessary. The decade-long political fiasco of its construction almost ruined the original idea of the building, ending with lifelong damage to many relationships and erosion of public trust in bureaucracy and politics. Isn’t this a bit like trying to build a new Australian education system? We have an alternative education system envisioned in the Alice Springs (Mparntwe) Education Declaration and inspired by the Gonski review but it’s widely rejected and misunderstood. Many seem to believe that this country has such a unique history and culture that restructuring its education system is too complicated. And, just as it happens with arts and design, when politics becomes the main driver of decisions, things begin to go wrong. Of course, today, the Sydney’s Opera House is a Unesco world heritage site, one of the world’s most famous and admired structures. The solutions that will fix the Australian education system are within our reach and – unlike the Opera House’s construction budget – do not require more and more financial investment. What is needed, more than money, is the imagination and political courage to implement the bold new ideas that would successfully convert yesterday’s failures into new opportunities for tomorrow. Australia built an Opera House in Sydney that many thought would be impossible. Similarly, we can rebuild a school system that offers good education and a fair go for all. Transforming Australia’s school education systems is not only mission possible; it’s a moral obligation for a country that calls itself an education nation. Both history and science underscore that trust in teachers as professionals is the way to educational equity and excellence. That evidence is clear – and the road ahead should be too.
