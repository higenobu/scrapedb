5/4/2022,"As an indication of how the stock market has suffered so far this year, the 2022 selloff has been unlike anything seen for the last 80 years. While there have been a host of reasons for the market wide rout, the meltdown has been most acute amongst growth stocks. As Wells Fargo’s Head of Equity Strategy Christopher Harvey puts it, ""the sell-off is all about ‘growth’ -- but not economic growth. Rather, it is about the growth style, the mispricing of duration, and risk appetite (or lack thereof).” But given the huge compression in valuations, Harvey thinks that ""in some cases Growth valuations quickly are becoming attractive."" In fact, Harvey believes many stocks aren’t likely to head much further down from here, anticipating a bottom will be found “between now and the early summer.” In the meantime, Harvey’s analyst colleagues at Wells Fargo have pinpointed two stocks which they see as now ready to push higher. Both have performed miserably so far this year – but Wells Fargo sees them moving up by at least 60% from here. We ran the names through the TipRanks database to get an idea of what the rest of Wall Street has in mind for these names. Here’s the lowdown. TELUS International (TIXT) Let’s start off in the tech sector, with TELUS International. This Canadian company is a global provider of IT and customer services. For over 600 clients around the world, Telus designs and develops next-generation solutions that assist with companies’ digital transformations. These digital experiences range from AI and bots, platform transformation, big data, cloud contact center and UX/UI design; the distinctive solutions are delivered to clients in order to help them draw in and maintain customers. The company went public just over a year ago – in February 2021 - with an upsized IPO of 42.55 million subordinate voting shares priced at $25 each. Gross proceeds reached $1.06 billion of which net proceeds to TELUS were roughly $490 million. The stock got off to a good start, rising throughout most of 2021, but like so many, the share price has pulled back significantly in recent times – since October’s peak, shares are down 46%. On the other hand, revenue and earnings have been climbing steadily since going public and the trend continued in the latest quarterly report – for 4Q21. Revenue reached $600 million, amounting to a 35.7% year-over-year increase, and beating the street’s call by $4.4 million. Adj EPS of $0.28 also beat the $0.24 consensus estimate. For 2022, revenue is anticipated to come in the range between $2.55 to $2.6 billion and adj. EPS in the range of $1.18 to $1.23. Both above Street expectations. It’s the prospect of further growth in the “mission-critical” field of digital transformations which has attracted Wells Fargo analyst Jeff Cantwell. “We see significant opportunity ahead of TIXT given its TAM of $225B, of which it has penetrated <1%,” wrote the 5-star analyst. “We believe the company has a long runway to continue to penetrate high-growth verticals, supporting our thesis that the company can generate strong, double-digit top-line growth on an annual basis over the next cycle. In addition, management has highlighted that it is focused on higher-value projects that we believe will be an important driver of incremental revenue growth and margin support over the next two years, particularly in '23.” In line with his bullish stance, Cantwell rates TIXT an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $35 price target supports growth of ~62% for the coming year. (To watch Cantwell's track record, click here) Most on the Street agree with Cantwell’s thesis; the stock boasts a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 6 Buys vs. 2 Holds and a single Sell. The average price target stands at $32.10, suggesting shares will appreciate ~49% in the year ahead. (See TIXT stock forecast on TipRanks) Hyperfine (HYPR) Let’s pivot now to something entirely different. Hyperfine is a medical device company that makes the world's first FDA-cleared portable MRI system which can be taken to the patient. The Swoop, as it is called, can also be hooked up to a standard electrical socket, and obtain crucial images – all in a much faster manner than traditional MRI systems. By significantly lowering MRI workflow time and taking patient transport risk out of the equation, the device could potentially yield better outcomes. Furthermore, adoption could be accelerated given HYPR’s system’s much cheaper price. And there’s a large and growing market to penetrate. The medical imaging segment is worth around $15.9 billion and boosted by macro trends such as the aging population and growing demand for early-stage detection of chronic disease, is anticipated to grow at a mid-single-digit CAGR through 2028. Hyperfine went public at the tail end of last year via the SPAC route. However, it’s been a trial by fire with shares down 51% year-to-date. That partly reflects the market souring on more speculative names. In 4Q21, the last reported quarter, Hyperfine generated revenue of just $0.436 million. That said, that was more than double the amount of the year ago period, and Wells Fargo’s Larry Biegelsen expects that figure to push much higher over the next few years. The 5-star analyst is anticipating revenue of $11 million in 2022, rising to around $30 million in 2023, with the net loss per share moderating from -$1.03 in 2022E to -$0.93 in 2023E. Explaining his bullish outlook, the analyst highlights several points underpinning the company’s value proposition. These are “1) highly differentiated first-in-class portable MRI technology, 2) market expansion opportunity in the multi-billion-dollar medical imaging market, 3) favorable economics driving penetration in emerging markets, and 4) promising pipeline of additional indications and entry into brain sensing.” To this end, Biegelsen rates HYPR an Overweight (i.e. Buy) while his $8 price target makes room for 12-month growth of ~132%. (To watch Biegelsen’s track record, click here) Some companies fly under Wall Street’s radar and HYPR appears to be one right now. Biegelsen’s rating is currently the only one on record.

5/4/2022,"Healthcare ranks as one of the most pressing concerns for retirees, and with medical expenses rising every year, two out of three Americans worry about high healthcare costs in retirement. Models estimate that a retired couple at age 65 will need roughly $200,000 saved for healthcare alone–exceeding the average American's total savings. As part of its annual inflation adjustments, the IRS has recently released new contribution limits for health savings accounts, giving retirement savers more power to save for these increasing medical costs. HSAs are generally viewed as a way to save for health expenses, but they can also serve as powerful tools for retirement. Now you can save even more. A financial advisor could help you plan for retirement and determine how an HSA could help with your financial goals. Speak to a qualified advisor today. IRS Increases HSA Contribution Limits for 2023 High inflation and rising healthcare costs combine to create an ever-increasing burden on retirees. As part of its annual adjustments, the IRS has released its 2023 inflation-adjusted contribution limits for health savings accounts (HSAs). Starting next year, individuals with a high-deductible self-only health plan can contribute an extra $200 to their HSA. The new limit will increase from $3,650 to $3,850. High-deductible health plans are health plans with an annual deductible that exceeds $1,500 for self-only coverage, or $3,000 for families. These are often paired with an HSA, which allows you to use pre-tax dollars to pay for qualified medical expenses. How Retirement Savers Can Take Advantage Many people primarily consider HSAs as a way to save for health expenses, similar to using a flexible spending account (FSA) for lower-deductible plans. However, HSAs are often a powerful yet underutilized savings tool that extends tax benefits far into retirement. HSA contributions are not subject to federal income taxes, so deducting your contributions from your salary can reduce your annual tax burden. You can continue to contribute until you enroll in Medicare. Furthermore, HSA contributions earn interest free of taxes. Those funds can be invested, as well, and just like with an employer-sponsored retirement plan, your investments grow tax free. As such, unlike an FSA, the funds do not expire at the end of the year; the balance rolls over from year to year and the balance is always yours to spend, save or invest. Lastly, at age 65, you have free access to your HSA funds for any purpose. There are no required minimum distributions and money taken out for eligible health expenses is not subject to federal income tax. If you do choose to withdraw funds in retirement, you will pay income taxes just like you would with other retirement plans. Bottom Line The IRS recently released updated HSA contribution limits for 2023, adjusting annually for inflation. Starting next year, individuals can contribute up to $3,850 a year in tax-deferred dollars. HSAs are powerful retirement tools that are often underutilized, despite their tax advantages and growing concern for rising healthcare costs. You can qualify for an HSA so long as you are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan, and you may port your account if you change jobs because the account always belongs to you, not your employer. HSAs are best suited for retirement investment savings, but this may mean that you will pay out-of-pocket for medical expenses while contributing to one. If in doubt, an expert can help you determine if an HSA is a good choice for you. Retirement Planning Tips Not sure if choosing a high-deductible health plan with an HSA will help you in retirement? For a solid, long-term financial plan, consider speaking with a qualified financial advisor. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.

5/4/2022,"Vladimir Putin has been forced to raid Russia’s dollar reserves to pay creditors in a U-turn that has staved off the country’s first international default since the Bolshevik revolution. Investors started to receive $650m of late payments on two bonds on Tuesday as part of a last-gasp bid to avoid a formal default before a deadline elapsed on Wednesday. The interest payments on the bonds have faced intense scrutiny since the Kremlin missed them in early April after the money was caught up in Western sanctions. Experts warned the country was almost certain to suffer its first foreign debt default in a century but Bloomberg reported Moscow unexpectedly used US currency not impacted by sanctions, sapping its domestic reserves. A 30-day grace period was due to expire on Wednesday and the Kremlin’s move came after it attempted to make the payments in roubles. However, the payments made to creditors could be just a stay of execution for the Kremlin. Russia is still facing a series of crunch moments in its battle to avoid default in the coming weeks, particularly when temporary measures by the US allowing American bondholders to accept Russian debt payments expire on May 25. Attention is now shifting to a payment due on May 27. Richard Briggs, an emerging market investment manager at GAM, said that May 25 is the “next hurdle” for the Kremlin’s debt saga. “Unless [the US] Office of Foreign Assets Control extends that authorisation, they won’t be able to continue to make payments,” he told Bloomberg on the US measures that will elapse later this month. Russia owes creditors around $40bn with half of the debt held by foreign investors. Half of its $640bn war chest of Russia’s foreign reserves have been frozen by Western central banks. A debt default typically trashes a country’s reputation with investors and makes it harder and more expensive to tap markets, worsening an economic downturn Charlie Robertson, chief economist at Moscow-based Renaissance Capital, said a default would be largely “academic” as sanctions mean investors are not “going to be buying the debt anyway”. He said Russia was not seeing the economic fallout associated with a debt default. Mr Robertson added: “What you're seeing in Russia is a currency doing the opposite of collapsing, getting much, much stronger, and an economy continuing to function pretty well. In terms of functioning, at least there are fuel supplies at the petrol stations and food in the shops.” Russia is expected to suffer a two-year recession after being bombarded by Western sanctions and corporate boycotts. Last month the IMF predicted that Russian GDP will plunge 8.5pc this year and fall a further 2.3pc in 2023 as its trade and financial ties are severed. However, the Kremlin appears to have staved off a full-blown financial crisis with a series of measures to shore up the economy, including capital controls to slow the flow of money out of the country. That's all from us, thank you for following! Before you go, have a look at today's stories from the business desk: Unilever bosses 'must break up business to escape mediocrity' Airliners ‘stolen’ by Putin to cost plane leasing behemoth $304m Citigroup takes responsibility for ‘flash crash’ that wiped €300bn off stocks Why London's Russian restaurateurs fear a backlash over Ukraine London is battered by the rise of work from home Alex Chesterman is a master of imitation. The 52-year-old entrepreneur’s previous successes, Zoopla and Lovefilm, were inspired by US players Zillow and Netflix, respectively. James Titcomb writes: Cazoo, Chesterman’s used vehicle online retailer that was set up in 2018, is modelled on Arizona-based Carvana. The “Amazon of cars”, founded six years earlier, delivers used vehicles to purchaser’s doors. Having gone public at a $2bn (£1.6bn) valuation in 2007, Carvana exploded to a $70bn (£56bn) valuation by last summer on a promise to rewrite the rules of how cars are bought and sold. When Cazoo followed it onto the US stock market in August, it was unsurprising that investors were desperate to snap up a stake. Now, however, the wheels appear to be coming off. As the cost-of-living crisis bites, alongside a shortage of vehicles and a market shift away from tech stocks, Cazoo’s share price is deep in the red.

Hannah Boland has more: James Watt, who also co-founded the Scottish brewer, said its 750 salaried workers would receive a total of 3.7 million shares over the next four years, with a 1.25pc stake distributed each year. The move will take Mr Watt's shareholding down from 24.2pc to 19.2pc and comes alongside a new profit scheme for bar staff. Mr Watt said the two moves would ""ensure that we are all in this together as we look to write the next chapter in the BrewDog story"". The company is taking the steps in the wake of allegations last summer that executives had created a ""culture of fear"" and that staff were ""treated like objects"". It has admitted it was tougher to recruit staff last year. The FTSE 100 has moved higher as energy shares lifted by upbeat results from oil major BP outweighed weakness in mining shares. After falling as much as 0.9pc, the blue-chip index recouped early losses to end 0.2pc higher at 7,561. BP gained 5.8pc as the oil major boosted its share buyback programme after net profit soared to its highest in more than a decade on strong oil and gas trading results. Miners were hit by lower copper and aluminium prices. ""I expect a lot of choppiness. The upside is challenging if you look at the way price action has been going,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. ""Much will depend on not only what the Fed does tomorrow but also on its guidance, balance sheet reduction and how fast it goes there, obviously the Bank of England on Thursday and the non farm payrolls data on Friday. Looking at the longer term, we're still in a downtrend for equity markets."" Estee Lauder said pandemic lockdowns in China contributed to what one analyst called a “catastrophic” forecast cut. The fragrance and beauty company now sees sales growth this year of just to 5pc to 7pc, down from a prior view of 8pc to 10pc growth. Estee Lauder attributed the bleaker guidance to store closures and supply-chain disruptions in China, higher costs, and disruptions in Europe due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The company cited the lockdown in Shanghai, which limited capacity at distribution facilities beginning in the middle of March. Chief Fabrizio Freda said the company is “confident that our business in China will rebound when Covid abates.” The implied outlook for the current quarter looks “catastrophic,” according to Bernstein Autonomous analyst Callum Elliott. By his estimates, the company is suggesting sales will fall 10pc to 18pc this quarter. He said it’s possible that “management is just being incredibly conservative.” The private equity firm that paid £7bn for Morrisons has offered to sell 87 petrol stations to ensure the deal is cleared by regulators. Laura Onita reports: The Competition and Markets Authority said it was “minded” to accept Clayton Dubilier & Rice’s proposal after it previously warned that the takeover could push up prices at the pump. CD&R also owns Motor Fuel Group, the largest independent operator of petrol stations in the UK, with 921 sites, while Morrisons has 339 petrol stations. The CMA previously identified 121 local areas where the two businesses overlap. On Tuesday, the watchdog said a sale “appeared to be suitable” but cautioned that CD&R was seeking to divest fewer petrol stations than the number of areas in which concerns were identified. The sale of some forecourts would impact multiple areas, it added. Pfizer has kept its outlook for annual sales of its Covid vaccine and treatment, disappointing investors who looked for the products to continue driving growth.  The pharma giant said it has secured $32bn (£25bn) in 2022 contracts for the shot, Comirnaty, and $22bn for its Covid pill, Paxlovid. Wall Street analysts had estimated about $34bn in annual sales from Comirnaty, which the company makes in partnership with BioNTech, and $27bn in Paxlovid sales. The world’s second-biggest aircraft leasing company has taken a $304m (£242m) hit after some of its planes were “stolen” by the Kremlin. Dublin-headquartered Avolon wrote down the value of 10 aircraft trapped in Russia to zero. My colleague Oliver Gill reports: It comes as Lloyd’s of London, the world's insurance market, prepares for a legal showdown over £8bn worth of planes seized by Vladimir Putin's regime.  Avolon is the second large leasing company to write down the value of its jets as a result of the Kremlin’s decision to put them out of reach of their foreign owners.  US-based Air Lease announced $802m of writedowns in relation to 27 aircraft that are being held hostage in Russia.

The admissions by the ecommerce titan last week has rattled real estate companies, amid worries a warehousing boom may be slowing down. Segro’s, which counts Amazon as a top-20 customer, dropped as much as 10.6pc, the most since March 2020. With just over an hour of trading left, European equities have flattened out with the FTSE 100 remains in the red. London’s blue-chips are catching a bit of pressure from the pound, which has risen 0.4pc today. Sterling has had a pretty poor run lately, in bad news for British households, as my colleague Tom Rees explains: Sterling has dropped by 8pc this year, which in itself will add 0.7 percentage points to inflation. Price rises have already hit a 30-year high of 7pc.  Markets are betting that the US Federal Reserve will hike interest rates at a quicker speed than the Bank of England. Combined with fears of a recession in Britain, this contributed to the pound sinking to a 21-month low against the dollar last week.  Economists fear the UK will be among the hardest hit by the cost of living squeeze.  Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: “The weak pound is another inflationary source at a time when inflation is already at a 30-year high of 7pc and is heading to a 40-year high of 10pc.” Read more: Sinking pound pours fuel on the fire of Britain’s runaway prices Facebook has ditched its podcasting product after just one year, appearing to cede the field to established players such as Spotify and Amazon’s Audible. My colleague Gareth Corfield reports: Meta, Facebook’s parent company, confirmed on Tuesday that the social network is discontinuing its Soundbites and Podcasts products after a note sent to partners revealing the change was leaked to Bloomberg.  Podcasting features will disappear from Facebook by June 3, according to Bloomberg, which also reported that the social media site will not alert users but “leave it up to the publishers to decide how they want to disclose that information”.  Facebook launched its “social audio experiences” last April with its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg saying at the time: “When we launched video rooms earlier last year, groups and communities were one of the bigger areas where that took off. So, I think around audio, just given how much more accessible it is, that’ll be a pretty exciting area as well.”  Podcasting has enjoyed a boom in popularity over the last couple of years, coinciding with COVID-19 pandemic induced lockdowns. German prosecutors are in the process of raiding Morgan Stanley’s Frankfurt office, as part of a probe into the multi-billion euro cum-ex scandal. Bloomberg reports: Authorities are searching a bank and the homes of two suspects in a probe over Cum-Ex and related strategies, according to a spokesman for Cologne prosecutors. More than 75 officers are taking part in the action, he said.  Morgan Stanley confirmed that its premises were targeted and said the investigation relates to a “historic activity” and that the bank is “continuing to cooperate with the German authorities.” Cum-ex was a trading strategy in which traders took advantage of a loophole in German tax law that allowed multiple investors to claim refunds per single payment made as part of a tax on dividends. My colleague Rachel Millard has a full report on this morning’s BP results. She writes: BP’s boss has insisted the company’s rising profits will benefit Britain’s pension savers, as Boris Johnson appeared to rule out a windfall tax.  Bernard Looney said the company was rewarding shareholders who are “real people” as it posted underlying quarterly profits of $6.2bn [£5bn] - its highest in more than a decade.  The results have fuelled further calls for oil and gas producers to face windfall taxes as they benefit from surging wholesale oil and gas prices which are pushing households into poverty.  Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, last week suggested the measure could be introduced if companies did not invest enough in producing energy.

My colleague Simon Foy reports: The Wall Street giant said one of its traders made a mistake “inputting a transaction” that triggered a knee-jerk selloff in Swedish stocks, wiping out as much as €300bn (£251bn) in a matter of minutes.   The bank said it identified the error “within minutes” and corrected it, but the mistake will come as a fresh blow to Citi which has spent years attempting to improve its financial controls.   Jane Fraser, the Scottish native who became the first woman to run a Wall Street bank when she took over in September 2020, has ordered thousands of employees to focus on improving Citi’s risk and controls systems. Read more: Citigroup takes responsibility for ‘flash crash’ that wiped €300bn off stocks Elon Musk is trying to reduce the amount he has to pay as part of a $44bn takeover of Twitter, Reuters reports. The wire says: Musk is the world's richest person, with Forbes estimating his net worth at about $245 billion. Yet most of his wealth is tied up in the shares of Tesla, the electric car maker he leads. Last week, Musk disclosed he sold $8.5bn worth of Tesla stock following his agreement to buy Twitter. The new financing, which could come in the form of preferred or common equity, could reduce the $21bn cash contribution that Musk has committed to the deal as well as a margin loan he secured against his Tesla shares, the sources said. Here’s a quick reminder of how Russia got to the brink of its first foreign debt default since the Russian revolution: Russia had been due to make dollar coupon payments on two Eurobonds in early April It attempted to make the payments in roubles, a move that was blocked by the US Treasury Several ratings agencies said rouble payment would contravene the contracts investors had bought, and therefore constitute a default Having failed to pay, Moscow entered a 30-day ‘grace period’ (due to lapse tomorrow), after which it would be deemed to have defaulted On Friday, the Kremlin U-turned, tapping its limited domestic dollar stockpiles in order to make the payment Those payments have gone through the system in recent days and have now arrived with some investors, suggesting a default has been averted Russia appears to have dodged its first foreign debt default in a century after the Kremlin tapped domestic dollar reserves in a humiliating U-turn for Vladimir Putin. Investors have begun to receive overdue payments on two bonds, Bloomberg reports. Russia initially failed to make the payments, before attempting to do so with roubles instead of dollars, a move that was blocked by the US Treasury. The White House is likely to hail the move as a victory for sanctions, as it had forced the Kremlin to erode its domestic cash stockpiles. Bloomberg adds: US sanctions currently include a broad exemption for sovereign bond payments. That runs out on May 25, and the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control hasn’t said if it will be extended. If it isn’t, that raises a major hurdle for payments due just days later for interest owed on sovereign notes.   “May 25th is the next hurdle,” said Richard Briggs, a money manager at GAM. “Unless OFAC extends that authorization, they won’t be able to continue to make payments.” That decision will come down to whether Washington deems it better to allow Russia to make payments and tap into its dollar cash pile kept at home, “or whether the optics of forcing a default is preferable,” he said. Ratings agency Fitch has cut its forecast for Chinese GDP growth this year from 4.8pc to 4.3pc, blaming Beijing’s Covid-19 policies. In a statement, it said: We expect the disruption to ease this month, as nationwide infections appear to be down from their mid-April highs and the politburo has indicated its desire to improve coordination between pandemic control and economic development. It expected growth of 5.2pc next year, up from the 5.1pc previously expected. With just over two and half hours of cash trading gone, the FTSE 100 is sliding along in the red, despite a 3pc gain for BP following those record profits. There’s a pretty big drag coming from commodities trading giant Glencore, which is slipping 3pc as waning demand puts pressure on industrial metals prices. The Reserve Bank of Australia surprised economists and markets today with a 25 basis points rate hike in its key interest rate to 0.35pc. The move, in the midst of elections in Australia, came two months of Governor Philip Lowe abandoned a pledge to remain patient on rates. The RBA is one of the last rich-national central banks to turn hawkish, leaving the European Central Bank looking increasingly isolated. It expects inflation of 6pc by the final quarter of this year, which will moderate to a still-elevated 3pc by 2024 if it presses ahead with interest rate increases/ Marcel Theiliant from Capital Economics said: The statement shed any vestiges of the Bank’s long-standing dovishness, arguing that inflation had picked up faster and to a higher level than previously anticipated and that there were also signs that inflation is picking up. Here are some of the day’s top stories from the Telegraph Money team: Scrapping flexible working promise ‘will rob carers of £3,000 a year’: Scrapping plans to give employees a mandatory right to flexible working will cost carers £3,000 a year in lost earnings, a think tank has warned. Five ways to claw back ‘free money’ from the Government: Energy bills cost more than ever before, the tax burden is at its highest for 70 years and soaring inflation is on track to spark the greatest squeeze on real incomes since 1956. ‘The British housing market is so unaffordable, I moved to Germany’: The housing affordability crunch in Britain is so bad that some young people are simply leaving the country. Russia is poised to avoid a historic default on its foreign debt after Moscow tapped its domestic dollars stockpiles to pay overdue coupons on two bonds. The US Treasury is said to have approved the $650m in coupon and principal payments, as part of its strategy to force Russia to erode domestic reserves (and in doing so force up its import costs). Now, the payments on eurobonds due in 2022 and 2042 have passed at least one clearinghouse, Bloomberg reports. The wire says: The funds were initially blocked in early April, triggering a 30-day grace period that ends on Wednesday. Russia said it made the payment in rubles, but that’s not allowed under the terms of the bonds. Then, with a default seemingly just days away, the government unexpectedly announced on Friday that the cash was finally moving through the financial system. The backdrop to these bumper BP profits is of course the conflict in Ukraine, and the ongoing disruption being caused by Russia’s ostracisation from the Western financial system. European Union officials are still stuck in a debate over whether to impose a full embargo on Russian oil, with Slovakia today become the latest country to warn it would oppose such a measure. Its Economy Ministry said today: If it comes to an approved embargo of Russian oil as part of a further package of sanctions against Russia, then Slovakia will request an exemption. Boris Johnson has shown himself to be one for turning, but it looks like the PM is sticking to his ‘no windfall’ stance for now.  Meanwhile, Italy is stepping up its raid on energy companies, with the Government announcing last night it would tax energy profits at 25pc, up from 10pc. Prime minister Mario Draghi said the measures, which will work alongside tax breaks for the industry, “include reforms to streamline and boost renewable investments that will allow us to speed the transition to a green economy”. He added: This will allow us to become independent from Russia’s gas. The former ECB president has resisted calls to expand the country’s deficit to tackle the rising cost of living. Speaking to Good Morning Britain, Boris Johnson has once again opposed an energy windfall tax, saying it would discourage investment in the UK. He said: If you put a windfall tax on the energy companies, what that means is that you discourage them from making the investments that we want to see that will, in the end, keep energy prices lower for everybody. The PM is also batting some tough questions on the cost-of-living crisis, and whether his Government is doing enough to help: PM says that government is looking at extra help for those who have disability needs meaning high electricity bills - though doesn't expand on that. He says a windfall tax on energy companies ""discourages them making the investments that will in the end make energy prices lower."" — Jessica Elgot (@jessicaelgot) May 3, 2022 Boris Johnson warns of ""very severe"" inflationary risk that ""could get worse"" with knock on effect on interest rates if benefits are increased.""I'm sorry to say this but we have to be prudent in our approach"".#GMB — Pippa Crerar (@PippaCrerar) May 3, 2022 Here’s a reminder, via my colleague Mason Boycott-Owen, of where we had got to in the windfall debate ahead of today: A windfall tax on oil and gas companies would be ""arbitrary and unexpected"", Kwasi Kwarteng has said, after the Chancellor threatened to implement the policy.  The Business Secretary said on Sunday that the one-off tax on the profits of energy firms when the UK is trying to invest in them “doesn’t make sense”.  It comes after Rishi Sunak said earlier this week that the tax would be “something I’d look at” if companies did not do more to support the economy, adding: “nothing is ever off the table in these things”.

In a call with the media following its first-quarter results, the company has highlighted it plans to spending £18bn in the UK by 2030 on oil and gas, wind farms, hydrogen, and electric vehicle infrastructure. Labour’s shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has reiterated her party’s call for a windfall tax in response to those BP results: NEW: $6.2bn profits for BP in first three months of this year.The case for a one-off windfall tax on oil & gas producer profits cannot be ignored.Yet still the Tories won’t back Labour’s plan to use it to cut energy bills.On Thursday #voteLabour for a party on your side. — Rachel Reeves (@RachelReevesMP) May 3, 2022 Here’s more on those BP results, via Bloomberg: The company followed its peers Exxon Mobil, Chevron and TotalEnergies, all of which saw their first-quarter net income – excluding Russia-related writedowns – soar in tandem with oil and gas prices after the invasion of Ukraine. BP comfortably surpassed analysts’ expectations and offered one clue as to how it managed to do so – an “exceptional” three months for its oil and gas trading business. Other commodities traders from Bunge to Glencore have also posted stronger profits, aided by the unprecedented volatility caused by the war. That trading boom is likely to fuel calls for a windfall tax on energy companies to help the Government tackle Britain’s cost of living crisis – a Labour policy that has divided the Conservatives. As my colleague Tom Rees wrote last week: A windfall tax is a one-off raid on the profits of a company. In this case, the profits of energy companies have been boosted by the surge in oil and gas prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A year-long and one-off levy on their profits, which critics say are being lifted by factors they cannot control, could help pay to support squeezed households. Read more: What is Rishi Sunak’s windfall tax and how would it work? Good morning. BP has announced plans to make share buybacks of $2.5bn this quarter after surging oil prices helped its cash flows surge. The energy giant said booming prices had helped it offset a $25.5bn charge incurred after exiting its stake in Russian producer Rosneft. It posted a first-quarter profit of $6.2bn, the highest in a decade. 1) Brussels accuses Apple of competition breach over contactless payments The iPhone maker has been accused of breaking competition law by limiting rivals' ability to create contactless payment apps. 2) Why London's Russian restaurateurs fear a backlash over Ukraine Dining hotspots that once boasted of their links to Putin are now speaking out against invasion. 3) London is battered by the rise of work from home Capital lags behind other cities as commuters shun the office. 4) Britain turns to South Korea in scramble to boost nuclear power Kwasi Kwarteng in talks over new generation of reactors as UK seeks stronger energy security 5) Julian Jessop: Brexit is not to blame for the surge in inflation and soaring food prices Experts are relying more on predictions and models than hard facts in recent commentary on Britain.

5/4/2022,"There are plenty of reasons for caution in the markets right now. The big point is inflation, which is stubbornly high and continuing to rise. In response, the Federal Reserve has begun to raise interest rates and tighten up on monetary policy – but this raised the possibility of recession, a fear that just go a boost from the 1Q22 GDP numbers, which contracted at an annualized rate of 1.4% for the quarter. This is a dramatic change from the blistering near-7% growth reported in 4Q21, and back up fears that the combination of inflation and a Fed policy switch is starting to stifle economic activity. On top of all that, we’re also looking at renewed, and even harsher, lockdown policies in China, which bodes ill for that country’s manufacturing and export sectors – and slowdown in China’s exports will have a heavy impact on US consumption. And if all that weren’t enough, there’s the Russia-Ukraine war. The economic and trade sanctions imposed on Russia by the Western nations are still reverberating in the world’s financial sectors, impacting banks and commodity markets. In response, investors are making the obvious move: getting into defensive stocks. Equity strategist Michael Wilson, in a look at the markets from investment bank Morgan Stanley, writes of this defensive mindset: “With defensives the latest big outperformer, they are now expensive, leaving very few places to hide. This suggests the S&P 500 will finally catch up to the average stock and enter a bear market.” Wilson is not the only market watcher showing a serious interest in defensive stocks. Wall Street is clearly paying attention to them, and it’s no wonder why: some are showing yields of 8% or better, and even with interest rates rising, a dividend of that magnitude is a clear outperformer. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve picked out two of these high-yield dividend payers, which also boast Strong Buy consensus ratings from the Street. Let's take a closer look. TPG RE Finance Trust (TRTX) We’ll kick it off with TPG, a real estate investment trust (REIT) company. These companies are perennial dividend champions, in part due to tax regulations that require them to return a high percentage of profits directly to shareholders – and dividends are a logical vehicle for that return. TPG has a reliable dividend history going back to 2017; in that time, the company has not missed a quarterly payment, and has even added special dividends at times. Finishing last year, TPG was managing a $5.4 billion real estate asset portfolio; of that total, 71% was made up of commercial office space and multifamily dwelling units. The company’s business is focused on the Eastern and Western US markets, which together account for 63% of the portfolio’s geography. The company will report its 1Q22 financial results this Tuesday, May 3, but we can get a good feel for its current situation by looking back at the Q4 results. The company generated a bottom line, in GAAP terms, of 51 cents per diluted share, a sum more than adequate to support the dividend payment, set at 24 cents per common share with a 7-cent special dividend added on. The regular payment, annualizing to 96 cents per common share, gives a yield of 8.7%. 5-star analyst Donald Fandett, of Wells Fargo, is bullish on TPG and writes: “Proceeds from asset sales and other factors should drive some modest dividend upside going forward... TRTX should [also] benefit over time as rates rise, particularly as loans originated with high libor floors roll off or get repaid... TRTX shares trade at a discount to the peers who are north of 1xBV, a gap we expect to close over time. And the company has a new CEO... who was the Head of US commercial real estate debt at Goldman Sachs."" Overall, Fandett believes this is a stock worth holding on to. The analyst rates TRTX shares a Buy, and his $14 price target suggests a solid upside potential of ~33%. (To watch Fandett’s track record, click here) The recent analyst reviews on this stock break down 3 to 1 in favor of Buy over Hold, giving a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are priced at $10.57 and the $13.75 average target implies ~30% upside from the current level. (See TRTX stock forecast on TipRanks) PennyMac Mortgage (PMT) Next up is PennyMac Mortgage, another REIT, operating in the mortgage investment trust sub-sector of the business. Rather than making direct investments in real property, PennyMac invests in mortgage-backed securities and direct loans to buyers. While the real estate market was hot last year, PennyMac underperformed. In 4Q21, the last quarter reported, PennyMac showed investment income of $49.5 million, a top line that was down from $196 million in the year-ago quarter. The company registered a net loss of 28 cents per share in the quarter. Despite these lackluster results, PennyMac kept up its dividend. The most recent declaration, for 47 cents per common share, was paid on April 15. With an annualized rate of $1.88, the common share dividend gives a robust yield of 12%. With average dividends among S&P companies running at ~2%, and Treasury bonds still yielding less than 3% despite recent increases, the attraction of PennyMac’s dividend is clear. PennyMac stock is covered by BTIG analyst Eric Hagen, who notes the headwinds in the mortgage market and still comes down on an optimistic note. “Levered mortgage investors face the risk of earnings compression connected to aggressive Fed policy, but beneath the overhang, we can still identify select catalysts which are largely disconnected to the level and direction of interest rates and mortgage spreads... We want to remain long the common stock here. PMT also has preferred stock yielding [12]%, with lower spread risk and funding sensitivity as a result of sitting higher in the capital structure.” These comments back up Hagen’s Buy rating on PMT stock, and his $18.50 price target implies a one-year upside of ~20%. (To watch Hagen’s track record, click here) The rest of the Street supports Hagen’s thesis. There are 5 analyst reviews here, including 4 Buys and 1 Hold, giving the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating. PMT is selling for $15.37 and has an average price target of $18.80, for ~22% upside potential.

5/4/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gave a strong sales forecast for the current quarter, indicating that the chipmaker continues to make strides in its most lucrative market: data-center processors. Most Read from Bloomberg Citi Trader Made Error Behind Flash Crash in Europe Stocks Biggest Treasury Buyer Outside U.S. Quietly Selling Billions Alibaba Recovers After Report on ‘Ma’ Briefly Erased $26 Billion Ukraine Latest: Kremlin Says Putin and Macron Discussed Mariupol Russia Seeks to Annex Occupied Ukraine as Invasion Goals Shift AMD predicted second-quarter sales of roughly $6.5 billion, compared with an average analyst estimate of $6.03 billion. That helped send the shares up as much as 8.3% in late trading Tuesday. The outlook helped allay concerns that the chip market is slowing -- and signaled that AMD is making further gains on Intel Corp. The company, which for years lagged far behind Intel in computer processors, is on pace to end 2022 with almost four times as much revenue as in 2019. New products and better execution have helped AMD win over customers who were once skeptical about its capabilities. AMD’s outlook contrasts with a recent forecast from Intel, which was hurt by an accumulation of inventory at some of its PC customers. The return of Covid-related lockdowns in parts of China also has squeezed the supply of components needed to complete devices, Intel said. Other chipmakers, such as Texas Instruments Inc., have said those disruptions are hurting growth as well. AMD’s forecast includes a boost from its acquisition of Xilinx Inc., a deal it completed in the first quarter. “Each of our businesses grew by a significant double-digit percentage year-over-year,” AMD Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said in a statement. Growth of the existing business and the Xilinx acquisition have both contributed to stronger full-year expectations, she said. AMD has reduced its expectations for the personal computer market this year. The company had previously projected no growth in PC shipments from 2021 but now expects a decline in the high-single digit percentage range, Su said. AMD will be less hurt by this because it’s still gaining share, particularly in more expensive models, she said. Despite AMD’s rapid growth, investors have shunned the stock this year, part of a broader pullback for semiconductor shares. Investors have been particularly wary of chipmakers that made rapid gains over the past three years, fearing that a collapse is near. AMD closed at $91.13 in New York Tuesday, down 37% this year. The latest forecast suggests that AMD still has momentum. Under Su, the company has developed leading-edge components and outsourced production -- something her predecessors struggled to do. That’s led more chip customers to ditch Intel in favor of AMD. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took the helm last year, is plotting his own turnaround. He now claims that his company is offering better PC processors than AMD and will take back market share. Unlike Intel, which manufactures its products in-house, AMD works with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., giving it access to better technology. Using the latest manufacturing techniques can improve the way chips process data and how much information they store. While TSMC has surpassed Intel in technological capabilities, it has struggled to meet demand for chips. But AMD has an edge over other TSMC customers. Its products are some of the most expensive items coming out of the Taiwanese factories, in theory making it better placed to get the supplies it needs. AMD is also the second-largest maker of graphics chips used in add-on cards by PC gamers. It competes in that market with Nvidia Corp. and will face fresh opposition from Intel, which has begun offering products for that segment for the first time in years. AMD, based in Santa Clara, California, supplies graphics chips used in Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox and Sony Corp.’s PlayStation. AMD reported first-quarter earnings of $1.13 a share, excluding some items, well ahead of the 92-cent estimate. Sales rose 71% to $5.9 billion, topping projections of $5.3 billion. The first quarter also included contributions from Xilinx. The chipmaker is predicting annual revenue of $26.3 billion for 2022, a gain of 60% from the prior year. That compares with an average estimate of $24.1 billion. AMD is gaining ground at the largest buyers of computer processors, owners of the giant data centers that are the backbone of the internet. Some 48% of all new processors installed in these data centers were bought from AMD in March, according to Jefferies & Co. analyst Mark Lipacis.
