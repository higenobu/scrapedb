1/10/2022,"In 1931, the Austrian logician Kurt Gödel published his incompleteness theorem, a result widely considered one of the greatest intellectual achievements of modern times. The theorem states that in any reasonable mathematical system there will always be true statements that cannot be proved. The result was a huge shock to the mathematical community, where the prevailing view was an unshakeable optimism about the power and reach of their subject. It had been assumed that maths was “complete”, meaning that all mathematical statements are either provable or refutable. The 25-year-old Gödel demonstrated this was incorrect by constructing a true statement that was not provable. Maths, he announced, has its limits.  The incompleteness theorem transformed the study of the foundations of mathematics, and would become an important result for computer science, since it shows that all formalised systems, such as coding languages, have limitations on what they can achieve. The theorem is also at the heart of today’s puzzle, which we’ll get to shortly. Gödel’s proof of his theorem is based on self-reference: in a formal mathematical setting, the statement ‘This sentence is unprovable” is both true and formally unprovable. The technical details of the proof are hard going. Yet the American logician Raymond Smullyan (1919-2017) devised a brilliant way to convey the gist of the incompleteness theorem using simple logic puzzles about truth-tellers and liars. Today’s teaser, composed in cooperation with Professor Benedikt Löwe of Churchill College, Cambridge, is inspired by Smullyan’s approach. The two tribes of If In the Ocean of Deduction lies the logical island of If. People born here belong to one of two tribes: the Alethians and the Pseudians. The only way to tell an Alethian from a Pseudian is to talk to them. Alethians always speak the truth, no matter what they are saying. Pseudians will always utter falsehoods, no matter what they are saying.At the centre of the island, the Master of the Alethians keeps the Ledger of Identity, a book that lists the names of everyone born on the island together with their tribe. The information in the Ledger of Identity is correct and freely available to anyone who asks.One day, an intrepid explorer arrives on If. She encounters various inhabitants and identifies them as Alethians and Pseudians by asking clever questions.After several successful such encounters, she meets a man called Kurt. The explorer does not know his tribal affiliation, but before she has time to ask him a question, he says “You will never have concrete evidence that confirms that I am an Alethian.” 1. Is Kurt an Alethian, a Pseudian or neither? 2. How might this relate to Gödel’s incompleteness theorem? Please return at 5pm UK for the solutions and a discussion. NO SPOILERS. Instead please post your favourite logic jokes. Today’s Gödelian puzzle is a pre-celebration of UNESCO’s World Logic Day, which takes place annually on January 14.

1/10/2022,"At the curtain call, Hugh Jackman put his arm around Kathy Voytko, an understudy suddenly thrust into the role of leading lady Marian Paroo in The Music Man. “Kathy, when she turned up to work at 12 o’clock, could have played any of eight roles,” Jackman, who plays Harold Hill in the musical, told the cheering audience. “it happened to be the leading lady. She found out at 12 noon today and, at 1 o’clock, she had her very first rehearsal as Marian Paroo.”  Voytko had stepped up on 23 December because Sutton Foster tested positive for the coronavirus. But then, on 28 December, Jackman himself announced that he had Covid-19 with mild symptoms and could not go on stage. Regarded as Broadway’s hottest ticket with a top price of $699 a seat, The Music Man is also a barometer of the uncertainty that prevails in the era of the Omicron variant, more contagious but apparently less deadly than previous waves. New York theatre is not closed, its leaders are at pains to point out, but it is not wholly open either, and cast lists on any given night can be something of a lottery. Last month, shows including Aladdin, Freestyle Love Supreme, Hamilton, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, The Lion King and Tina were forced to cancel performances. The musicals Ain’t Too Proud, Diana, Jagged Little Pill, Trevor and Waitress, and the play Thoughts of a Colored Man, decided to shut down earlier than planned because of infections and weak ticket sales. The fresh surge is cruel timing for Broadway, which reopened with fanfare – and vaccine mandates for cast, crew and audiences – in September after a record 18-month closure because of the pandemic. For a while it seemed the triumph-over-adversity, show-must-go-on spirit was unstoppable. Then Omicron came like a kick in the teeth. Gabriel Stelian-Shanks, artistic director of the Drama League, the only creative home in America for stage directors, recalls: “We weren’t really sure what was going to happen but things were looking good. Audiences were returning. Shows were reopening. We had found a way to do it safely. And as that got into September and October, we realised we were having theatre that was not a superspreader event. “We were feeling very good about it and then, at Thanksgiving, we all learned the word Omicron and the speed and rapidity with which we had to learn how this is different. It almost feels to me like a different epidemic in terms of its incredible ability to be contagious. Omicron is so new that the question for us is: how do we manage a surge?” New York state recorded more than 85,000 new coronavirus cases on the last day of 2021, its highest single-day total since the pandemic began. The Omicron variant has the potential to rip through a cast, orchestra and crew of 200 people. Stelian-Shanks says: “Omicron is a numbers game in many ways about infection and the number of people who have to be in close quarters versus those who don’t. We’re seeing some of those shows simply fall to a probability no one expected. We’re not seeing deaths, we’re not seeing severe hospitalisations, but we are seeing enough infection where we can’t continue with certain performances.” But most shows remain open and at least some of those that do not were struggling and likely to run out of steam even before Omicron. The mood is very different from the dawn of the pandemic in March 2020, when Broadway felt like a ghost town, its playhouses dark and restaurants empty. Stelian-Shanks adds: “I’m deeply pessimistic about January but if we look a little further down the road to spring and summer, the picture is a lot rosier. That is, of course, assuming that the medical experts are right and that Omicron’s going to burn very fast through the population. “If we’re still dealing with Omicron in May then who knows? But I can’t find anyone who isn’t telling me that we’re in a radically different picture with Omicron by the end of February.” Aware of these predictions, some producers have responded by temporarily closing shows in January and February, typically the leanest months to bring in audiences, with a view to reopening in March. Mrs Doubtfire, a new musical comedy at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre, will take “a hiatus” from 10 January to 14 March. Kevin McCollum, its producer, estimates the cost of the hibernation will be around $500,000, whereas trying to keep the show running through the same period would mean a loss of at least $3.5m. “I had to close and then reopen,” McCollum explains. “The good news is we have a very tight group of people who have been working on the show for three years and everybody knows how good it is. I am taking also the calculated risk that we’ll have our company back ready to go in March and of course people need jobs. This is the best thing I can do to create long-term employment. “I think I used the metaphor of trying to plant a sapling in a hurricane. You have to get out of the way of this tsunami of Omicron and come back and replant when everybody is ready to go out again. And that’s what I’m doing for Mrs Doubtfire.” Big musicals need full houses to turn a profit but the pandemic has smashed international tourism as well as domestic consumer confidence, with many people wary of buying an expensive ticket that they might need to cancel at the last minute. Mrs Doubtfire was making $175,000 a day in ticket sales after opening but, once the wave of Omicron-related closures took hold, that dropped to $50,000. The cost of daily Covid-19 testing at the theatre for a full company and staff of 115 people went from $18,000 a week before Omicron to almost $60,000 a week after. And the cancellation last month of 11 performances of the show, based on the 1993 film starring Robin Williams, due to coronavirus infections among cast and crew turned an expected $1.5m earning into a $1.5m loss. McCollum, whose previous credits include Rent and Avenue Q, muses: “We are an industry that is used to being at constant risk and those of us who toil in the theatre have maybe a chip missing: we are resilient against all odds. So it’s painful but that’s no reason not to get up and try again. “The cliche is there is no people like show people and in times of true disappointment we are there for each other. Even though we are colleagues, collaborators, competitors ultimately, we want to know that tomorrow, if we put our our life’s blood into it, could be a better day.” McCollum, also producing the musical Six on Broadway and The Play that Goes Wrong off-Broadway, adds: “The key is to recognise yes, in many ways it’s unfair but that’s no reason to become a victim. You have to pivot and get up and figure it out tomorrow. I think that’s what people love about Broadway and it takes a certain amount of grit and indomitable spirit. Those are two very powerful ingredients.” Playwright Lynn Nottage currently has two projects on Broadway. Clyde’s, a comedy at the Helen Hayes Theater on Tuesday, has survived Omicron relatively unscathed apart from thinned-out audiences. But MJ: The Musical, which features the music of Michael Jackson, was forced to cancel several performances last month due to multiple coronavirus cases within the company. Nottage believes that the media is accentuating the negative but prefers to see the glass as half-full. She tweeted last month: “There’s so much emphasis on what’s closed on Broadway, let’s show some luv to the shows that r still OPEN. PLAYS r out here beating back the virus & the odds.” She adds in a phone interview: “Pre-Christmas and during the fall, it really felt like Broadway was coming back. The restaurants were crowded, the streets were crowded. You felt a lot of energy in the air and some of that hasn’t left. There’s still people very much here eager to get back to business as usual but you can feel the hesitation. “But that said, we were in the theatre on Sunday for MJ and we were almost completely full and audiences that came were ready and were enthusiastic and happy and wanted to be engaged. There are people who are really desperate to get back to theatre.” Nottage, a double Pulitzer Prize winner, concludes: “I’m an optimist by nature so I do believe that when this thing crests, people will come back. We’re going through an unprecedented, difficult moment but the fact is – and I can say this about the two shows I’m involved in – we will weather this storm.”",Arts/Stage,‘We will weather this storm’: Omicron wreaks havoc on Broadway,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/10/omicron-covid-coronvirus-broadway-theatre-stage
1/10/2022,"At least superficially, works of medical recovery share much common ground: the bleep of life support, the arduous rebuilding of one’s new normal. But cult US musician Mark Lanegan is no Michael Rosen, the beloved children’s author whose fight with Covid is justly famed as a heroic tale: the unimpeachable battling the unimaginable and emerging a trenchant critic of the government’s failures. Rosen eventually swapped a wheelchair for a stick, one he wrote a children’s book about. There is no Sticky McStickstick in Devil in a Coma, the slim but powerful volume detailing Lanegan’s own Covid ordeal, just the metaphorical two-by-four with which he beats himself. The author of roughly half a dozen solo albums, plus a healthy body of collaborative works that includes fronting grunge outliers Screaming Trees and time spent in Queens of the Stone Age, Lanegan is an antihero who would be the first to say he is probably undeserving of our sympathy. His celebrated 2020 memoir, Sing Backwards and Weep, is one of the bleaker tales of rock’n’roll excess ever committed to print.  Prompted into existence by his friend, the late chef Anthony Bourdain – Lanegan and QOTSA’s Josh Homme did the theme tune for Bourdain’s final series, Parts Unknown – Lanegan’s first memoir detailed a life of substance misuse and the interpersonal catastrophes that flowed from them, chief, among many, the loss of Lanegan’s close pal Kurt Cobain. Lanegan emerged from that first unsparing account chastened and self-aware; his gallows humour and trenchant wisdom made him a charismatic raconteur who stood outside the more conventional literature of drug glorification or rock myth-making. He also seemed absurdly immune to death, a characteristic that the musician refused to mine for macho points but, rather, regards as some imponderable state of undeserved grace. No sooner had the accolades dried on that memoir than Lanegan, relocated to Ireland, land of his great-great-great-grandfather, to escape Covid, contracted Covid. In denial at first, he falls downstairs. Unable to breathe, deafened, with deep welts on his scalp and a useless leg, he is committed to hospital and put in an induced coma on kidney dialysis. His wife learns that Lanegan holds the hospital record for surviving longest in this parlous state. At one point, she refuses to allow the doctors to perform a tracheotomy that would have ended his singing career. Three weeks later, he comes to. Semi-consciousness is almost worse. With his system inured to opiates from long spells of addiction, the pain relief and sleeping pills the hospital can muster amount to chicken feed. They struggle to find usable veins; Lanegan’s offer of his jugular is turned down by a young physician. His long stay in a County Kerry hospital is “like a jail cocktail with a viral chaser”, worse, he says, than the psychiatric ward he was once committed to in Italy while withdrawing from heroin, worse than the time he’d nearly had his gangrenous leg amputated, worse than when, as a child, he was in a full body cast after falling off a bridge. He suffers hallucinations, insomnia, he can’t eat much apart from milk. His past comes back to torment him with a vengeance, in visions and dreams: Covid, in short, feels like karma. As with Sing Backwards and Weep, Lanegan’s prose combines naturalistic speech and a kind of lucid lyricism: “I’d taken my share of well-deserved ass-kickings over the years but this thing was trying to dismantle me, body and mind, and I could see no end to it.” A number of poems that process his frustration, the fever dreams and events from Lanegan’s complicated, past break up the chronological account (he has published a collection of poetry, Leaving California, and a collection of lyrics, I Am the Wolf). A passage that ponders the idea of Covid as a conspiracy is presented as evidence of the dark places to which the disease sent Lanegan’s addled mind. In some ways, the section sits a little uncomfortably inside a book that has nothing but bottomless gratitude to the Irish health service that cared for him. Still, there is always much to admire in Lanegan’s writing even when it is hard to agree with everything he thinks. This slight but weighty volume only adds to the man’s muscular and vivid – in every sense of the word – body of work.  Devil in a Coma by Mark Lanegan is published by White Rabbit (£12).

1/10/2022,"Whether you have a newborn or know someone who does, a good baby monitor can be both freeing and reassuring, helping keep an eye on the little ones as they rest. But with so many to choose from with varying brands, capabilities and prices, it can be hard to know which work best in practice. So we put nine of the best baby cameras to the test across three different categories for travel or home. Here are the ones that delivered.  Price: £139.99 With a sturdy parent unit and two cameras for split-screen capabilities, the Babysense V43 performs impressively pretty much across the board. The parent unit is user-friendly with responsive buttons and a logical, well-labelled menu. The built-in lullabies are a little old-fashioned and tinny, and while it displays room temperature it does not show the time. The Babysense is wifi-free, making it safe from remote hackers. Its 300-metre wireless range means the parent unit, which can be used on battery or mains, can be taken outside ready for warmer months. Notably, none of these features waned or stalled when two cameras were connected during testing. Settings for each camera can be tailored individually, and switching between camera feeds is almost instantaneous. Up to four cameras can be used with one parent unit with additional purchases. The battery lasts about 10 hours in eco-mode, which pauses sound and video on the parent unit if the camera detects no sound for 30 seconds. A spare or replacement battery costs £5.99. The base of each camera has a pleasant orange night light, while the lens pans, swivels 360 degrees and zooms quickly and smoothly. The motor, while not silent, did not disturb a sleeping baby. Panning is controlled via the parent unit, meaning there is no need to fiddle with camera angles once initial setup is complete. The cameras can be wall-mounted using the screws and wall plugs included, but easily lifted away for travel purposes. Many monitors designed with travel and flexibility in mind sacrifice screen size, but that is not the case here. The 5in screen has good picture quality, which is extra clear when close up to faces or objects. There is no delay in movement or audio on the unit, although two-way talk mode sounds somewhat walkie-talkie-esque. There’s no need to worry about software updates as there is no app, which also makes the Babysense a smart option for those looking to avoid checking their phones during the night too. Verdict: A comprehensive package that offers genuine flexibility, with smooth panning, speedy connection and an impressive range without the need for wifi. Runner-up: VTECH VM3254 Price: £50 The VTECH VM3254 offers a compact, wifi-free package, making it suitable for travel, and the picture quality is good, particularly close up. The talk function, however, is far too quiet and the button layout on the parent unit isn’t particularly easy to navigate. Our runner-up, the VTech VM3254 is still an excellent option for the price, but note the battery cannot be replaced and it is not repairable. Price: £159.99 This baby monitor may not be made by the Kodak of old, but at least it lives up to picture quality of the brand name. Via either phone app or parent unit with 5in screen, the Cherish C525 displays not just the baby’s features or silhouette, but even subtle facial expressions during the day with lifelike colour, which cannot be said for competitors. Night mode is also excellent, while movement and audio come through with minimal delay and the two-way-talk sound is crisp. Not only does the camera zoom and swivel 360 degrees at an almost imperceptible volume, the parent unit can handle split-screen viewing with up to five paired cameras with additional purchases. There is a fair selection of pleasant-enough lullabies, white noise and heartbeat sounds, plus room temperature monitoring. Special milestones and events can be captured and stored either on an SD card or in the cloud. The Kodak smart home app for Android or iPhone is easy to navigate and intuitive but the parent unit is less so. While the keyboard can be backlit, which is handy for night-time check-ins, its icons are not labelled and the buttons are fiddly, so you need to learn how to navigate it efficiently. Despite this drawback, the parent unit, antennae and handy flip-stand are sturdy, and the device is neither fragile nor too heavy. It has two factor authentication for extra security when accessing the app and requests authentication if you attempt to log in from a different location than usual. Alternatively, the camera and parent unit – though not the app – can be used without an internet connection. Out of the house, both the camera and parent unit can run on battery power for a few hours. The units are generally repairable and replacement batteries are widely available too. Kodak will support apps for the Cherish for a minimum of three years after the model is discontinued. Verdict: Outstanding picture quality sets this monitor above the rest, while most additional features are well executed. Runner-up: Motorola VM65X Connect video baby monitor Price: £249.99 With stylish rose gold detailing on the parent unit, a sleek camera and a sturdy over-cot stand, the Motorola is an attractive package. However, it is more expensive, the picture quality is less sharp, the colours are not as true and there is a slight crackle to the voice when speaking to the baby. The battery can’t be replaced either. Price: £299 The Nanit Pro’s 1080p HD camera, app and breathing band is a comprehensive and well-executed baby monitoring system for parents who wish to cover every possible base. There is no parent unit, but the app is efficient and streamlined making checking in on the baby easy. The camera’s stream goes live in the app within 3 seconds with little in the way of delay, and switches between day and night mode automatically. The camera has a good zoom and field of view over the cot but does not swivel. That means there is no disruptive motor to worry about, and as it will be either attached to a wall or floor stand (£80 additional purchase) it won’t get knocked over by rambunctious pets or other children. As for security, Nanit encrypts your data, protects accounts with two-step verification and has various settings for controlling when and who can see the feed from the camera. The app shows room temperature and humidity, while five buttons allow users to quickly snap a photo, play music, white noise, birds or wave sounds, listen to or talk to the baby and switch on a nightlight. The nightlight is particularly good. It shines upwards with adjustable brightness so you can see the cot and immediate surroundings without disturbing the baby or others in the room. The Nanit comes with a year of basic “Insights” including special milestones and memory videos, sleep tracking and quality analysis, and breathing monitoring using a soft, electronic-free band wrapped around the baby’s torso, which sounds an alarm if an issue arises. Insights are only stored for two days, which costs £5 a month after the first year or £10 a month for 30-day storage. One breathing band for babies up to 15kgs is included, and swaddles or pyjamas for older children are available. The camera is repairable and the app is available on a wide range of Android, iOS and iPadOS devices. Verdict: A comprehensive, efficient system that fulfils its myriad promises to reassure even the most anxious of parents. Runner-up: Owlet Baby Monitor Duo Price: £389 The Owlet is as sophisticated as the Nanit in many ways, with a sleek camera, excellent picture quality and user-friendly app. But it uses a “smart sock” to monitor breathing and oxygen levels, which children could disturb or kick off, sounding the alarm and terrifying parents in the process. There is also a noticeable delay in both the video and sound in comparison with the Nanit too, and while replacement parts are available the batteries cannot be replaced and the devices are not repairable.",News/Technology,Best baby monitor cameras for travel or the home,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/10/best-baby-monitor-cameras-for-travel-or-home-wifi-wireless-smartphone
1/10/2022,"Idon’t know about you but, personally, I want to start my year watching other people who have demonstrably made a mess of their lives. So I am thankful to the BBC for snapping up Couples Therapy (Monday, 10pm, BBC Two), the 2019 Showtime series that is custom-made for the early days of the year when you want to see other people weep on a sofa in front of their partner. Is it sick of me to want to watch that? Very possibly, very possibly. But one episode of this and you will be as terminally horrible as I am, too. The format, but quickly, because the clue is in the title: a diverse cast of couples have for some bewildering reason agreed to have their journey through therapy recorded and televised, overseen by relationship expert and very empathetic nodder Dr Orna Guralnik. In the wrong hands, this would be a schlocky inversion of First Dates, where you see people tentatively break up instead of play footsie. But it is shot so sumptuously and gorgeously (and all the couples are so casting-agency perfect) that I had to pause a couple of minutes in to check I wasn’t actually watching some weird under-the-radar legacy TV show scripted by a genius. But no, no. That is a real man, in a short-sleeved shirt with strange buttons on the sleeve, saying: “I am the easiest person to deal with. All I want is … zero responsibility, and all the sex I want without any work.”  Watching Couples Therapy, you soon suss out, is like watching a game of football as a complete neutral. When you don’t have any attachment (or resentment) to either team, you can enjoy the spectacle for the sheer thrill of the action, and choose who you prefer just by who is playing well. The episode opens with Annie and Mau. At the two-minute mark I have no skin in the game, at the three-minute mark I’m shouting at the referee, and by four minutes I’m somehow starting an entire anti-Mau personality online and making memes about him getting kicked in the head. It’s very strange, watching couples spar as an abstract observer: I can see both sides of the immovable obstacle in Lauren and Sarah’s relationship, but I can’t untangle the many threads to decide who is right enough to make the whole thing move in their direction. I am pulling for Elaine and DeSean to figure things out, but I am frustrated by their inability to listen to each other. How any therapist on earth doesn’t just descend every session into yelling: “BE NORMAL! STOP BEING STUPID!” I do not know. This doesn’t make it clearer. That, actually, is the only moment when Couples Therapy trips over itself. In a bid to build a more 3D image of its only sustaining character, Dr Guralnik, we watch as she travels to her own therapist and they have a too-therapy-y conversation about how being a therapist is a burden and a gift and a stress and a hardship. That is all fair and good, but it’s not as good TV as watching Mau try to explain how getting a dominatrix for his birthday was a great present but not the right one. Couples Therapy is best because the dialogues people have in therapy are so weird and removed from real conversation – the most intimate and revealing chat you’ll ever have in your life, but spoken with the uneasy tone you use to say: “Sorry, can you just repeat your name again?” to someone at a party – and veering away from that seems like a waste of TV minutes. But there are times when it can be startlingly powerful television. The thing is, you’ve seen therapy and breakups and confessions before, but either through the lens of scripted dialogue – clever back-and-forths with a storyteller’s flair for slow reveals – or Love Island-style knowing reality TV. To watch the real thing – the speed at which people talk, the way they spool out confessional until they are telling the deep foundations of their personality out loud – is really something else. There’s a scene in the first episode where you see the exact moment a couple realise they have to break up, and nothing – not your real-life breakups, not any breakups your friends have had, not anything you’ve ever seen on television or film – prepares you for the quiet, heavy, solemn moment two brains realise their hearts are no longer aligned. Is it normal to want to watch this? No. Is it amazing anyway? Oh, absolutely yes.",Arts/Television & radio, Couples Therapy: nothing can prepare you for this startling fly-on-the-wall TV,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/10/couples-therapy-nothing-can-prepare-you-for-this-startling-fly-on-the-wall-tv
1/10/2022,"In October I was involved in a minor accident driving my old, but beloved, BMW 740 (1997). The vehicle I hit had slammed its brakes on, and, although the driver called the police, he was subsequently arrested for being on drink or drugs. Ever since, I have been battling my insurer, Privilege, to receive a reasonable payout.  On the basis of a series of photos, it decreed the car is a category B write-off – so badly damaged it should not be allowed back on the road. I have challenged this as I would like to have it repaired. I have asked that it actually inspects the car, rather than assuming it is structurally damaged. Privilege has refused to do this and has told me that, even if I send my own engineer who finds it can be restored, it will not change its mind. Its attitude has been that the company now owns my car, and that is that. The courtesy car I was offered for two weeks has been taken back. I have really looked after the car since I bought it in 2000 and it has only covered 105,000 miles. It is a design classic but the company has offered a derisory £4,150 for it. I feel very badly treated. DF, Altringham = Sadly, this story gets worse. Even after I had suggested to the company that the only reasonable outcome was that it send an independent engineer to examine the car, it was, according to Privilege, accidentally sent to be scrapped. This was done without your permission and even after the executive team had become involved in your complaint. The company, part of the Direct Line group, has defended its original decision not to send someone to examine the car and said its engineers acted professionally. As well as sending the car to be scrapped – which it has apologised for – it has refused to increase its £4,500 valuation. After my intervention, it agreed to refund your £350 excess, and to pay a further £210 towards taxi costs as a (rather lacklustre) gesture of goodwill. Once an extra sum is added for petrol taken from the car (don’t ask) is added, it brings your total payout to just short of £5,000. You believe the car is worth closer to £6,000, and have sent examples of the few similar cars currently for sale. I am not sure it is worth £6,000 but agree that the way that Privilege has dealt with your claim has been high handed from the start. Having sent your car to be scrapped while negotiations were ongoing, the company has seemingly denied you the opportunity to challenge its decisions. If you still want to pursue this, I would hire a specialist insurance expert, Motor Claim Guru, Tim Kelly. He says he still may be able to get your car back, will examine it, and ultimately act on your behalf with Privilege. Whether the value of this claim will justify his fees is another matter, but he is highly recommended. Alternatively, the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) will look at your case for free, but it will take months to come up with a decision. “If your vehicle was scrapped without your consent, we’ll look at how this affected you. We might tell your insurer to compensate you for any distress or inconvenience that this caused, as well as for any items that were inside the car when it was scrapped,” it advises. The online reviews from others who have claimed from Privilege do not make pretty reading. I’d be interested to know other readers’ experiences – good or bad? Email the usual address. A lot of people seem to have had their festive holiday plans thrown into chaos after they unexpectedly failed the pre-departure PCR test demanded by their destination country. It appears that these tests are returning positive results for those who had Covid several months before.

1/10/2022,"When Dieynaba Sidibé discovered graffiti, it was love at first sight. She was 17 and had already begun experimenting with painting and drawing. “​​It was on TV. I was sitting in my living room and I saw people doing big walls and I thought, ‘This is what I need’,” the Senegalese artist says, one hoop earring shaking as she laughs. “I don’t like small things. I was doing big canvases, and I said to myself: ‘A wall is a bigger surface for expression’.”  Her parents wanted her to focus on her studies, but Sidibé, who adopted the name Zeinixx, sought out Senegal’s budding graffiti community, finding her way to the Africulturban cultural association – a nonprofit in Dakar’s Pikine suburb that promotes urban culture through festivals and skills training. There, she persuaded one of the country’s pioneering artists, Oumar Diop, AKA Afia Grafixx, to mentor her. “I already had my basic drawing skills because I used to draw Mickey Mouse, McDonald’s logos, and things like that, and I drew on the walls of my room,” Zeinixx, 31, says. “Grafixx showed me what graffiti was – how to write, how to do lettering – and I started to get interested in hip-hop culture. Now, here I am, 14 years later.” Zeinixx is Senegal’s first female professional graffiti artist and a core member of its male-dominated hip-hop scene. She is also a slam poet, singer, and entrepreneur. In August, she launched Zeinixx Entertainment, organising visual arts workshops for young people. “My refrain is to tell young people: ‘Don’t let others choose for you what you would like to do tomorrow’,” she says from the Africulturban centre, where she runs communications and is preparing for her next project at a girls’ high school in Dakar. “For me, it’s essential to be able to make your own decisions,” she says. Senegal is in many ways a conservative country, but also has a long history of art, music and poetry. Traditionally in this part of west Africa, the artistic caste of griots were responsible for storytelling through music, spoken word, and dance. Senegal’s first president, Léopold Sédar Senghor, was a poet. And last year, a Senegalese writer, Mohamed Mbougar Sarr, won the prestigious Goncourt literary prize. “All this is the common point that unites us, that brings us all together,” says Zeinixx, who colleagues refer to as the “first lady” of graffiti. “It’s this need to express ourselves, this need to share things and to do beautiful things, whether it’s audiovisual or something physical like dance, or something else.” Hip-hop took root in Senegal in the 1980s with some American influence. But it has maintained its own distinctive flavour. “It’s a culture that has a lot of virtues and principles, like peace, love, and harmony,” Zeinixx says. “Here in Senegal you’ll find [the traditional Wolof and Pulaar oral poetry] tassou, kebetu, and pekan – these genres are not hip-hop but they have similarities.” Graffiti, one of the four main elements of hip-hop culture, is more accepted in Senegal than in some other countries. “In the United States, for example, there is a special brigade that tracks down graffiti artists. We’re not like that,” she says. “Here, it’s a country where you do graffiti and a policeman stops to say ‘Respect man, that’s nice!’ […] So I think we found a way to make it our thing, our microphone, to get messages out.” Senegalese graffiti is typically socially conscious messaging, Zeinixx says. “You speak directly to the people with messages like, ‘Stop throwing rubbish in the streets,’ or something like ‘thiono dou reer’ [hard work always pays off],” she says. “They’re actually messages of hope.” She and her fellow graffiti artists once came across a dilapidated wall, covered in rubbish and urine, in Dakar’s Colobane neighbourhood. They cleaned it up and covered it with the message: “Be the protector of your environment.” “For a long time, the wall remained clean,” she says. Zeinixx’s messages are often for and about women. Last month, she participated in a campaign as part of the annual UN initiative 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence. At her first workshop, Graff’All, in October and November, six of the 14 participants were women. “It was important that they could see me in the room very, very often, and it was important that they could hear from me,” she says. “We are still in a very masculine environment … and the rare women we find in this environment, most of the time, they don’t really assert themselves.” What she is doing is huge, says Fatou Warkha Sambe, a prominent Senegalese feminist and journalist. “We need women everywhere, in every domain. And she’s a pioneer, so I admire her.” Another recent workshop, Taaru Mbedd (beauty in the street), paired 15 young artists with mentors for four days of discussions before they painted the walls of the French cultural organisation the Institut Français du Sénégal à Dakar. Inspired by the theme djoko, which means connection or communication in Wolof, their work will be exhibited there until April. Zeinixx asked the trainee artists to bring their families to the exhibition’s opening. In her speech, she pointed to her mother in the audience and said, “If what we are doing is a bad thing, my mother would not be here.” She told them that, as Senegal’s first woman graffiti artist, she has travelled to Australia, Belgium, France, Switzerland and the US. “I’ve represented Senegal all over the world, and it’s graffiti that got me there,” she said. Afterwards, she says, several parents called to thank her for reassuring them. “Lately, the activities she has been leading, the workshops – we see young girls interested in graffiti because she has started to really influence girls,” says Babacar Niang, AKA Matador, a graffiti artist, dancer, rapper, and early member of Senegal’s hip-hop community, who founded Africulturban. “It’s great, because it’s not a man’s domain: if you have it in you, you should be able to do it. Her project must continue because the girls need these spaces to express themselves, to blossom,” he says. Niang has known Zeinixx since she was a teenager and says she always had talent. “In the beginning, we had to insist that she focus on her studies, but once she had finished school and we couldn’t ask her not to come, she began to integrate more with us,” he says. “Graffiti wasn’t very developed in Senegal at the time, and then to have a girl who wanted to do it, it was huge.” Zeinixx has a straightforward message for young women. “It’s to tell the girls to be focused on what they want to do, what they want to become … to set goals that they will achieve,” she says. “Don’t ask, ‘Can I do it?’ When in your head you say, ‘I’m going to do it,’ normally you can.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,Painting a bigger picture: Senegal’s pioneering ‘first lady’ of graffiti ,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/10/painting-a-bigger-picture-senegals-pioneering-first-lady-of-graffiti
1/10/2022,"The first song I remember hearingMy Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean, from a multi-coloured vinyl kids’ album. I liked it so much, I dressed up like the kid in the John Lewis advert and danced around the sunroom to the song in a bedspread and headdress to entertain my mother’s knit and natter group, but they just looked puzzled.  The song I inexplicably know every lyric toI grew up in Kettering. We didn’t have culture. The nearest we got was Andrew Lloyd Webber. I went to see Jesus Christ Superstar, got the album, then the sheet music. So I probably know every word. The first single I boughtEmma by Hot Chocolate, from Woolworths. I liked the lyrics: “I’m gonna write your name high on that silver screen.” The song that’s my karaoke go-toI avoid karaoke at all costs. The last time I did it was at theological college. We pulled in at a pub in a post-industrial town in West Yorkshire, but they didn’t want Christmas carols, so I ended up singing Olivia Newton-John’s part from You’re the One That I Want. A fellow ordain from Liverpool called Degsy was John Travolta. The song I can no longer listen toThis Charming Man. Much as I like the song, Morrissey has ceased to be charming for me. The best song to play at a partyI really like Making Plans for Nigel by XTC. It would probably get me to go home sooner, which I’m always looking for at a party. The song I last streamedA Hymn for St Cecilia by Herbert Howells. On St Cecilia’s day – the patron saint of music – last year, I used the song in morning prayer. It’s such a beautiful setting, I’ve played it five times since. The song I secretly like, but tell everyone I hateI would never admit to liking Phil Collins. No Jacket Required would be the soundtrack of hell, I think. But secretly I like Phil Collins, and secretly I really liked Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now). The best song to have sex toWell, it’s been a while. So I’ll say Soul II Soul’s Back to Life (However Do You Want Me). The song I wish I had writtenDon’t Leave Me This Way by the Communards. We sold an awful lot of records of it, but we didn’t write it. If we had, I’d have a much bigger pension.

1/10/2022,"Yes, you can file without penalty until 28 February this year, but leaving it until the last minute is fraught with problems. If you are not registered with HMRC to complete your tax return online, you will need an activation code, which the website says will take up to 10 days to arrive. Even if that is in hand, you need to give yourself time to track down the right facts and figures, and to check that everything is correct.  “If you do end up doing it at the last minute you are more likely to make mistakes or miss out vital information,” says Kevin Sefton, the chief executive of the tax app untied. “Plus, if you need to get in touch with HMRC for any reason, it is more difficult the nearer the deadline you are.” Sefton advises writing a list of where your money comes from: “This could be money you earn through an employer, through self-employment, rental income, bank or building society interest or any recent dividend payments.” The online form will prompt you to remember a lot of this but it’s worth going through your bank statements to see where money has come in from during the tax year in question. Pull together annual statements for savings and current accounts, and any dividend statements. Terrible savings rates mean that you might not have to pay any tax on that income: if you otherwise earn less than £12,570 you can earn up to £5,000 in interest without being taxed. Above that, there are allowances for those earning less than £17,570, and a personal savings allowance, too. The personal savings allowance means basic rate taxpayers get their first £1,000 of interest tax-free, while higher-rate payers get their first £500 untaxed. You might be able to offset some of your outgoings against earnings. If you have made a capital gain through selling shares or an investment property, you can use losses from the same or a previous tax year to reduce it – you will need to register both on your form. For the self-employed, there are business expenses that can be claimed for including the cost of equipment and clothing. “Small business owners and the self-employed are often hesitant about claiming their full expenses, says Lee Murphy, the managing director of the Accountancy Partnership. “But this can mean paying more tax than you should.” If you are an employee but have been forced to work from home because of the pandemic, you can make a claim for some of the associated expenses. For the 2021-22 tax year you can make an immediate claim for relief on £6 a week expenses online but if you did not do that for 2020-21 you do it in the employment section of the form. If you have filed online before, a lot of the data will be saved in your account, including your unique taxpayer reference and national insurance number. If you are using the service for the first time you will need to dig out these details before you start. The online service gives you a list of the paperwork you might need to complete your form – this includes your P60 from your employer, if that applies, a P45 if you have left employment in the last year or a P11D or P9D, which shows any benefits and expenses you have been given through work. You will also need to find your tax code – this should have been sent to you by HMRC. The 2020-21 tax return will be the one in which you need to declare any help you received during the first year of the pandemic. HMRC says that more than 2.7 million people claimed at least one self-employment income support scheme payment before 5 April 2021 and these need to be declared before the deadline. The online service asks about Covid support and provides a section for you to fill in. Higher-rate taxpayers who have given money to charity out of taxed income may be able to reduce their bill by claiming gift aid. You will need to have claimed gift aid when you made the donation, which would have boosted the charity’s coffers by 25p for every £1. On your form you claim the difference between basic and higher-rate tax. If you made a payment of £100 and the charity claimed 20%, you can claim the extra 20% of the total – £25. Regular monthly donations count, as long as you have signed up for gift aid, so include them. It’s possible you have forgotten how generous you were more than a year ago, so take a look back through emails – maybe search for the word donation or for the names of sites such as JustGiving, which you may have made a payment to. You can claim relief on donations made this tax year (you will need to remember not to claim them again). If you or your partner claims child benefit then HMRC will be interested in both partners’ earnings. If one partner earns more than £50,000 it will want some of the benefit paid back – the charge is tapered so that by the time one person earns £60,000 the whole lot must be repaid. The form asks if either of you claimed the benefit, and if your income is higher or lower than your partner’s. It makes no difference whether you are married or not. There are lots of guides on HMRC’s website and elsewhere online, so if you are unsure how to fill in a particular part of the form you should be able to find advice. It’s pretty unlikely you will find someone to take on your tax return this year, but if your financial affairs are complicated, it might be worth getting in a professional for next time – if you are self-employed you can even claim for the cost of employing your accountant. Once you have filed you can relax – but keep your wits about you. A common scam features a text or email telling people they are owed a tax rebate, and with the subject on your mind this could be the easiest time of year to fall for it. Ignore any messages asking you to give details to get your money back.",Lifestyle/Money,Self-assessment tax return: how to get yours done,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/10/self-assessment-tax-return-how-to-get-yours-done
1/10/2022,"Q My partner and I own a residential property that we bought in June 2019 at a cost of £217,995. I paid £8,399 in stamp duty which was at the higher rate as I owned (and still own) a buy-to-let property. We have are interested in moving to a new-build property that is priced at £560,000 but it won’t be ready until February 2023 at the earliest. We want to avoid chain-related issues as best as we can, therefore our thinking is to sell our current residential property and move in to rented accommodation. And then, when the new-build property is available for us to reserve, we can do so knowing that we are not part of a long chain which could fall through at any time.  My question is – what rate of stamp duty will apply here? Is it the higher rate or would it be the standard rate? I will still own the buy-to-let property at the time of the completion on the new-build property but my understanding is that because I am replacing my main residence (ie we sold our current residential property and replaced it with another residential property), then the standard rate applies. Or, will we pay the higher rate on the day of completion but be eligible for a refund of the higher-rate part of the bill because I sold my previous residential property within three years?VP A Your understanding is mostly correct. Even though you have a buy-to-let property, because you are selling your “main residence” – to use the jargon – and replacing it with another main residence, the standard rate of stamp duty land tax (SDLT). So there would be no need to apply for a refund. The higher rate would apply if you still had your current property on the day of buying the new one. But if you managed to sell your old property within three years of buying your new home, you would be eligible to apply for a refund of the higher-rate part of your SDLT bill. If you don’t manage to sell your old home within the three-year time frame, you have to be able to prove exceptional circumstances. In the words of the government guidance on SDLT, the exceptional circumstances “may be, but are not limited to: the impact of government-imposed restrictions preventing the sale; an action taken by a public authority preventing the sale”.",Lifestyle/Money,How much stamp duty will we pay on a new home if we own a buy-to-let?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/10/how-much-stamp-duty-will-we-pay-on-a-new-home-if-we-own-a-buy-to-let
1/10/2022,"Novak Djokovic will be immediately released from immigration detention in Australia, after the federal circuit court ordered a decision to cancel his visa be quashed. But the Australian government’s counsel, Christopher Tran, has revealed the immigration minister will consider exercising a personal power to cancel Djokovic’s visa meaning he is not guaranteed to stay and compete in the Australian Open.  The decision now under consideration to cancel Djokovic’s visa anew would result in him being excluded from Australia for three years – significantly upping the stakes in a bizarre border stoush that threatens Djokovic’s quest to win the most grand slam singles titles of all time. After a lengthy adjournment on Monday the judge Anthony Kelly read a consent minute agreed between the world No 1 male tennis player and the home affairs minister, Karen Andrews. Djokovic, after being temporarily released from immigration detention earlier on Monday to attend the remote hearing, was present off-screen as Kelly ordered the visa cancellation decision be quashed and costs awarded in his favour. After the decision is quashed, Djokovic must be released from detention within 30 minutes with his passport and personal effects be returned to him. Kelly said it was “unreasonable” for Australian Border Force officials to interview Djokovic on Thursday morning and cancel his visa in circumstances where they had agreed to give him until 8.30am to speak to officials and respond to the proposed visa cancellation. Tran informed the court that another minister of the Australian government – the immigration minister, Alex Hawke – would consider exercising a personal power to cancel Djokovic’s visa. Kelly praised his candour. He questioned if such a power was exercised whether Djokovic would be removed from Australia and unable to return for three years, which Tran confirmed. “The stakes have now risen rather than receded,” the judge said. “I cannot purport to encroach on the valid exercise of a minister of executive power.” Kelly noted the personal cancellation could be appealed and warned he expected to be “fully informed in advance” if such a decision was taken.",News/Australia news,Novak Djokovic wins appeal against decision to cancel his Australian visa,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/10/novak-djokovic-wins-appeal-against-decision-to-cancel-his-australian-visa
1/10/2022,"Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today.  Novak Djokovic has just won his legal battle to enter Australia and defend his Open tennis title after a judge quashed the government’s decision to cancel the player’s visa when he arrived in the country last week. After a dramatic day of legal argument in the federal circuit court in Melbourne, Judge Anthony Kelly also ordered the government to pay the player’s costs, and for Djokovic to be released from the detention hotel where he has languished since last Wednesday. You can read the latest reaction and how the day unfolded at our live blog. The world No 1 men’s player was denied entry to Australia last week amid confusion over the validity of a Covid vaccine exemption granted by Tennis Australia. After hearing arguments from the player’s lawyers earlier today, Kelly queried “what more” the player could have done to prove his medical exemption given that it was provided by a qualified physician and backed up by an independent Victorian government panel. Kelly also criticised the Australian government for reneging on a deal to give Djokovic more time to defend his visa from cancellation. The judge’s ruling means Djokovic will meet tomorrow’s deadline to enter the tournament he has already won nine times. Cladding call – Michael Gove must spend billions more on fireproofing homes across England, campaigners will say today, as they warn that his £4bn move to replace all Grenfell-style cladding does not address other risks facing leaseholders in tower blocks. People living in unsafe properties have been landed with bills of up to £200,000, and campaigners say residents may still have to stump up to fix defective fire doors, flammable balconies and missing firebreaks. Under Gove’s plan, which aims to force developers to pay the £4bn bill but could require funds to be diverted from existing government budgets, only cladding remediation costs will be covered. ampaigners want a change to the law to protect them from all costs caused by fire safety defects that were not their fault. It comes as 19 people died in a fire in a tower in New York in one of the city’s worst fire disasters in recent times. Vaccine push – The UK government is urging all pregnant women to get vaccinated with their first, second or third shots as it highlights the Covid-19 risks to mothers and babies. One study showed that 96.3% of pregnant women admitted to hospital with symptoms between May and October were unvaccinated. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, called for the UK to show the rest of the world how to move from pandemic to endemic Covid, and suggested it would be helpful to cut the isolation period to five days to ease workforce shortages. But there are still deep divisions in the scientific community about what “living with Covid” could entail. Power play – Ed Miliband says it “beggars belief” that the government is opposing a windfall tax on oil and gas companies on the grounds that they are struggling, after Labour proposed a £1.2bn levy on producers to help households and businesses with soaring bills. As the political battle builds around cost-of-living issues, the shadow climate secretary said ministers’ rejection of the idea showed they were “weak and incompetent”. With more dependency on renewable power, the UK will need more storage solutions – here are four new technologies that could help pave the way. Dog day – The Power of the Dog and Succession were the big winners at the Golden Globes, which went ahead in Los Angeles overnight with no stars or audience after years of controversy over diversity led to a boycott by celebrities. The acclaimed Netflix drama The Power of the Dog was named best picture in the drama category, while Jane Campion became the third woman to win best director. Will Smith was named best actor in a drama for King Richard, while Nicole Kidman won best actress in a drama for Being the Ricardos. Steven Spielberg’s remake of West Side Story dominated the musical/comedy categories, while on the television side, HBO’s Succession won best drama, best actor for Jeremy Strong and best supporting actress for Sarah Snook. Here be dragons – A gigantic prehistoric “sea dragon” discovered in the Midlands has been described as one of the Britain’s greatest ever fossil finds. The ichthyosaur, which is about 180m years old and around 10 metres long, is the largest and most complete fossil of its kind ever found in the UK. The skeleton was found during a routine draining of a lagoon island at the Rutland Water reservoir in February 2021.
