4/3/2022,"As little as a few fleeting weeks ago, while Ash Barty was still dominating all opponents in her path, the gap between the world number one and the rest of the top players seemed to be as vast as a canyon. Beneath her, so little separated the rest, and in her absence anyone could beat anyone else on any given day. Yet in no time at all, the landscape of women’s tennis has shifted due to one player alone: Iga Swiatek has established herself as the transcendent figure in the sport. Two days before she officially becomes the new world number one, Swiatek took another enormous step forward in her young career with one of her biggest wins yet, dismantling four-times grand slam champion Naomi Osaka 6-4, 6-0 to win the Miami Open. Having started the season still just working towards producing her best level on hard courts, 20 year-old Swiatek’s progress has accelerated at an astonishing rate. She has now established a 17-match winning streak, all on this surface, becoming just the fourth woman in history to clinch the Indian Wells and Miami ‘Sunshine Double’. She is also the first player to win the first three WTA 1000 events of the year. This carried significance beyond the personal triumphs of Osaka and Swiatek. At Toronto in 2019, Osaka and an 18 year-old Swiatek faced off in a match so wildly entertaining and high quality that it sparked a friendship between them. It became clear that this was potentially an era-defining rivalry, and Miami marked their first meeting since, this time on equal terms as grand slam champions. Not only has Swiatek dramatically improved since then and even when she won the French Open aged 19 in 2020, she is also utterly vicious in the biggest matches. In her five grand slam and WTA 1000 finals, no player has won more than five games against her. While Osaka was able to match her intensity at the beginning, the completeness of Swiatek’s game was too overwhelming. Swiatek has established herself as one of the best in the world both defensively and offensively. She countered Osaka’s first strike with her athleticism and intelligence, she smothered Osaka’s second serve with her exceptional return and also comfortably controlled the baseline, out-hitting Osaka off both groundstrokes by the end. Swiatek has so many options, and she is steadily learning how to use them. Ten days ago, Swiatek was relaxing in bed when a member of the team knocked on her hotel room door to inform her of Barty’s retirement and the possibility that she could be world number one. With all of that extra pressure on her shoulders, Swiatek responded by obliterating Viktorija Golubic 6-2, 6-0 to clinch the No 1 spot and she powered on to win the tournament without dropping a set. The most ominous part of this breakthrough is what is to come: the clay season, her best surface, is next. Even after a defeat that ended so bluntly, this has been an excellent tournament for Osaka, too. Over the past year, she has dealt with her mental health struggles in the public eye and, having played so few tournaments since winning the Australian Open last year, Osaka fell as low as 85th in the rankings in February. She has explained that she began speaking with a therapist after being heckled in Indian Wells last month and her positive frame of mind in Miami has yielded some of her best tennis in years. With so few events under her belt, the level set by Swiatek should only serve as inspiration for her to meet this challenge in their future encounters. The hope is that there will be more to come. Meanwhile, the men’s No 2 Daniil Medvedev has announced that he will be out for one or two months after undergoing a “small procedure” due to playing with a hernia for some time. The surgery puts Medvedev’s presence at the French Open in doubt, which begins at the end of next month.",Sport/Sport,Iga Swiatek sweeps aside Osaka in Miami Open to clinch ‘Sunshine Double’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/02/iga-swiatek-sweeps-aside-osaka-in-miami-open-to-clinch-sunshine-double
4/3/2022,"Before Stacey O’Toole bought her new property in North Richmond, on the outskirts of Sydney, she diligently checked everything she could to ensure it wouldn’t be affected by flooding. But when Australia’s east coast was hit by a “rain bomb” in early March, it had to be evacuated because two local stormwater dams were at risk of failing. They didn’t – but O’Toole says “we were very concerned because we thought we’d bought somewhere that wasn’t going to be impacted”. “We looked at all the data, we looked at the flooding maps as well, and obviously did all the conveyancing that you do when you buy a property,” she says. O’Toole has lived and worked in north-west Sydney for nearly 30 years and has three properties in the area – making her a seasoned navigator of the flood-prone region. But the flooding has been getting worse with the area hit with two “one-in-100-year” floods in two years, she says. “It’s starting to change and places are flooding that have never flooded before, especially around the Pitt Town area. It might be nuisance flooding or local flooding – but it got to a point where it was impassable. “I’ve never really been concerned with floods before because I know where the water is going to go. [But this time] our main evacuation route went underwater while we were on it.” Potential flooding presents a dilemma for prospective buyers. In Sydney’s white-hot housing market the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley proved an opportunity for buyers – although prices surged by up to 45% during the pandemic, according to real estate website Domain. In Richmond, prices grew by up to 32%, and O’Toole believes the influx of new homeowners aren’t as well informed as they should be. “A lot of people in the new areas thought the floods wouldn’t impact them but they had power and water cut to their homes because it all comes from the same place,” she says. “They weren’t particularly educated, they think they are safe up on a hill, but they’re absolutely not.” There are many blocks of land and properties for sale in flood zones – including in Richmond, Windsor, Pitt Town and Penrith – where the advertisements do not mention the flood risk. None of the real estate agents selling the properties contacted by the Guardian responded to requests for comment. O’Toole argues communication with prospective buyers must improve. “People spend a lot of money on those homes, but you can’t change the fact that you are on a flood plain,” she says. “There needs to be a better system for people to actually understand what the dangers are.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Marcus Claxton, who is building a house on a block of land in the Redbank estate in North Richmond, agrees. He says it should be mandatory for real estate listings to mention the flooding risk. “If it is in a flood zone, they should have it front and centre, because people may not know to ask,” he says. “If a home is in those flood zones – and long term Hawkesbury residents know those areas – I would strongly advise against buying there.” Claxton and his wife have always lived in the region and intended to stay – but are worried about the rising flood levels. “During this year’s flood, the road used for flood-free access actually flooded, which was a bit weird,” he says. “I was a bit unnerved watching the water rise because it did come a lot higher. They [the authorities] really need to scrutinise what land they make available for building. And they need to rethink the one-in-100 year flood line … we need to go maybe one or two metres above that.” Chief executive of the real estate institute of NSW, Tim McKibbin, says it is not mandatory to include flood-risk warnings on listings but agents must disclose if a property has been flooded in the past five years. There is no obligation to disclose if a property is on a flood plain. “It becomes very uncertain because the legislation and the regulation only talks about the past five years,” McKibbin said. “The legislation and regulation are also silent on how agents should disclose that [recent event] information – they only need to demonstrate they have made that disclosure.” Tom Hubble, a geologist and associate professor at the University of Sydney, says it is “quite reasonable” to expect more frequent and higher floods to hit the region. “I’m expecting repeat events of floods of similar sizes and possibly quite a bit larger over the next few decades,” he says. “If I was placed in charge, I would be endeavouring to reduce the number of people that are located in what we would recognise to be flood-prone ground. “The inherent cyclicity that is probably evident in the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley, and the specific nature of the channel geometry suggests to me that that’s not the best place to have large urban populations, or even large, semi-urban and semi-rural populations.” Thousands more people could soon be living on the Hawkesbury-Nepean flood plain if land already approved for development were to proceed, according to planning officials, councillors and the state government’s own data. The NSW government is pausing new developments while it revises its flood strategy but pressure to open up more land for housing isn’t expected to ease. The Coalition is pursuing a controversial plan to raise the wall of Warragamba Dam which it argues could mitigate some risk. Hubble says the area has experienced long term cycles where floods then droughts dominate – with each period lasting 30 to 50 years. He says the lack of major floods in the region between the early 1990s and recent years reflects we are shifting into a new cycle. “If the observation of the flood-dominated regime versus drought-dominated regime is real then we can expect floods as large or larger to occur on a relatively frequent basis.” The geologist says authorities should rethink planning decisions based on the one-in-100-year flood line and the advice given to people buying land or homes in the area. “Unfortunately, the geography and the geology of that area means that the one-in-200-year and the one-in-500-year flood and the probable maximum floods are much, much higher events than we would expect to encounter on most flood plains. “So the probable maximum flood is about twice the height of the one-in-100 year flood in that particular river system down around Windsor and Sackville. And if there is cyclicity in the system, then a lot of our estimates may well be underestimates.”",News/Australia news,As water levels rise so too does the pressure to stop building houses on flood plains,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/03/as-water-levels-rise-so-too-does-the-pressure-to-stop-building-houses-on-flood-plains
4/3/2022,"Jon Faine was going to call his book Dear Cretin. It would be a collection of letters he’d been sent when presenting Mornings on ABC Radio Melbourne, annotated to explain the context: the particular topic or opinion of his that had inspired so much rage. But then ABC management “went nuts”. “They tried to tell me it was [down to] copyright [over the letters], to which I said, ‘No – they’ve sent it to a public broadcaster’,” Faine says. It was one of regular spirited clashes with management over his 30 years at the station. “We had all sorts of arguments. In the end they just begged me not to do it. They said it’ll just inspire more.” And so, Faine is talking to Guardian Australia about a very different book, Apollo & Thelma: A True Tall Tale. It’s a yarn that’s enthralled him for 40 years, studded with rabble-rousing moments from his own career as a lawyer and broadcaster. It started when Faine was 26 and a “baby lawyer”, and professional strongman Paul “The Mighty Apollo” Anderson sought his help in the resolution of the estate of his sister Thelma, herself a formidable character who ran an outback pub. Faine’s fascination with this larger-than-life family intersected with his long connection to the Northern Territory – he wrote a previous book, Lawyers in the Alice, about the early days of Aboriginal legal aid. As such, Apollo & Thelma takes fascinating side roads into the Gurindji walk-off and land rights activism, where Faine befriended figures such as author Frank Hardy. “There’s an amazing photo of me and Gough Whitlam just before he turned around and wept on my shoulder – and I wouldn’t clean that suit for years,” Faine says of Hardy’s memorial service, for which he was MC. “There’s also a reveal that our eldest son [wife Jan’s son, Faine’s stepson] is Bundjalung, which I’ve never talked about, but it’s in context here and with his permission … I’ve always been a fairly private person but I tell things in this book that had to be negotiated with my wife and kids.” If Apollo’s feats of strength with buses and elephants are amusing, so are Faine’s bouts of mischief as a law student and legal aid activist. Take the “shit-stirring” stunts aimed at embarrassing the Fraser government, such as making High Court of Australia Fan Club T-shirts with a cartoon of an ass in a judicial wig; parading a donkey around with a mop on its head; and performing a street theatre take of Oliver, but with a legal aid worker begging “Please sir, could I have some more?” Not long later, in 1982, Faine flew to Darwin to investigate Thelma’s estate and narrowly avoided getting busted for two joints in his luggage during a security search in Brisbane – which could have set him on a very different path to that of esteemed social commentator. The book also “sets the record straight” about some of Faine’s high-profile run-ins during his Mornings tenure. At one point, he was told he was the most complained-about ABC Radio presenter. “And I was proud of it. I said, ‘You mean no one else is doing their job to the point that people complain?’ The fact that people complain means, first of all, they’re listening, and secondly, they care. How good’s that?” When Faine left the ABC, he was eulogised in the media and sent off with a farewell show at Melbourne Town Hall. Faine says he’d planned something more modest, but when Red Symons, the former Breakfast host, left after his contract wasn’t renewed, there was anger from the audience about the way it had been handled. “So I was pretty much told, we’re going to use your departure as a bit of healing. I said, well in that case, if you’re going to make it what you are, I’m going to invite Red on the stage. I think he got a standing ovation. A lot of love.” Faine is known for his fearless interrogation of politicians, and has interviewed the Victorian premier, Dan Andrews, since his days as a junior minister. “He’s not a friend, although he’s someone I’ve got a lot of regard for. I think he’s quite a remarkable political figure and an enduring one, much to the disgust of people who thought they run this place, by which I mean the Herald Sun and 3AW.” With Victoria heading to the polls in November, Faine says the opposition leader, Matthew Guy, has yet to offer up a convincing agenda. “He has to give people a reason to think he will do a better job than just being a critic. Andrews got elected on level crossing removal. It’s about the most unsexy piece of infrastructure imaginable, but people went, ‘Oh, yeah. I get that’.” On a much grander scale, there’s now the proposed $50bn suburban rail loop, which threatens to swamp any other infrastructure plans. “That’s going to soak up pretty much all the funding for decades,” Faine says. “There’s no doubt, federally and state [wise], that the GST is going to have to go up. Why don’t you just square with us and admit it? You’ve got two choices. You can either do what Shorten wanted, which is get rid of negative gearing and all the tax breaks for middle class and rich people, or you can put up the GST. But the attitude now is you can’t do tax reform from opposition, you can only do it from inside government. So whoever wins the [federal] election will start softening us up for a 15% GST I reckon.” And who does he think might win that federal election? “I think it’s possible for the government to lose, there’s no doubt about it. Memo to Scott Morrison: governments lose elections, oppositions rarely win them. “I was quite surprised at the miracle win that Scott Morrison pulled out of the bin fire last time. I will be equally surprised if he does it again. In a nutshell, they’re a minority government, young people laugh at them, women don’t like him, the Chinese ethnic community think he’s been targeting them unfairly. “They’re going to lose seats in Victoria, in Western Australia, Melbourne and Perth. Jacqui Lambie says they’ll lose seats in Tasmania; there aren’t that many to pick up in Queensland or in South Australia and in New South Wales.” Much of the past two years in Melbourne media has been dominated by debate over Covid lockdowns. When asked if Andrews’ press conferences during lockdowns became a performance, he counters, “They didn’t become a performance, they always were. No doubt at all [journalists] were told, ‘See if you can rattle him’. It was appropriate to grill him; I would have done the same myself. He was making announcements that had enormous ramifications … It absolutely needed to be scrutinised.” In terms of the wider media response to the pandemic, Faine doesn’t think anti-vaxxers have been created by the press, but giving them prominence has been unhelpful. I mention a column he wrote for The Age in which he criticises Victoria’s shadow treasurer, David Davis, for addressing the protesters, “albeit as props for the TV cameras”. Isn’t it the job of a politician to listen to the people? “No. His job is to be an alternative government, not to pander to the fringe,” says Faine. If you’re going to go cuddling up to an extremist fringe, you’re never going to be able to, in any way, sell your brand to the centre, because you’ve poisoned your brand.” Faine himself talked to some protesters at the time. “I wrote a column and I called them saboteurs. I still get hate mail saying, ‘how dare you call us saboteurs, we’re just citizens standing up for our rights’ – to which I went, you’ve never cared about anybody else’s rights. I’ve been a human rights advocate and activist for all my working life. Where have you been?” Three years after retiring from the ABC, Faine still gets enraged missives, ranging from antisemitic screeds to death threats. He pulls out his phone to read out the latest. Still, he does miss the show, although he doesn’t regret leaving. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning “Like the footballer who does one game too many, I never wanted someone to tap me on the shoulder and say, ‘Jon, it’s time’. I’ve seen so many colleagues have that experience and it destroys how you see yourself and it takes a long time to recover, if you ever do.” When the pandemic hit and all his engagements were cancelled, he felt sorry for himself for a bit before throwing himself into the book. “You’ve got to remember, I’ve spent my whole working life being incredibly busy and then six months after I leave I don’t have a single thing in my diary for the rest of my life,” he says. How did that feel? “Terrible. I don’t want to make a big deal of this, but I got pretty down. And then after a bit of that I went, pull yourself together, there’s a lot of people much worse off … Stop looking back, stop regretting and find something else to do.” Apollo & Thelma is published by Hardie Grant on Wednesday, 6 April.",Arts/Books,"Even after 30 years of broadcasting, Jon Faine still has some secrets to tell",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/02/jon-faine-sets-the-record-straight-and-the-enthralling-tale-that-inspired-his-new-book
4/3/2022,"Next to the old Eacham shire council chambers, on Queensland’s Atherton Tablelands, is a mosaic on a shop wall. One of nine made to commemorate the centenary of federation, the mosaic depicts a tropical rainforest. The centrepiece is a giant red cedar, a tree with timber once considered so valuable it was called ‘red gold’. Two men swing axes into the trunk, exposing pale wood. Nearby, a tree kangaroo watches a felled cedar being dragged away by a bullock team. From the air, the Atherton Tablelands is a living mosaic. Visitors flying into Cairns from the south soar over tiles of dark green rainforest, light green maize and sugar cane, white iron roofs and rust red earth of harvested paddocks. The scene is framed by forested mountains. But 150 years ago, the Atherton Tablelands was covered in a type of dense rainforest called mabi forest, named after the Ngadjon word for the Lumholtz’s tree kangaroo, which lives there. Many mabi species lose their leaves in the dry season, unlike the trees in wetter rainforests, allowing a dense shrub layer to fill the space between the trunks. In the late 1800s, timber cutters came for the red cedar. When that dwindled, they turned to kauri pine, black bean and Queensland maple. In 1903, an experimental plantation was established in mabi forest at Wongabel near Atherton, and the nascent timber industry lobbied the government to establish reserves to ensure a steady supply. But the government had other plans for the area – the fertile basalt soil of the mabi forest was perfect for crops. Clearing proceeded, sped up by the first world war soldier settlement scheme where removal of the “scrub” was a condition of occupancy. Now mabi forest covers only about 860 hectares, less than 4.5% of its former range. Apart from two larger blocks – at Curtain Fig national park and Wongabel state forest – it is confined to tiny patches on private land. Mabi forest is critically endangered but committed locals are doing their best to restore it. Every Friday at the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service nursery at Lake Eacham, near Yungaburra, about 50 volunteers gather to prepare and plant seeds from rainforest trees. The volunteers are members of Trees for the Evelyn and Atherton Tablelands (TREAT), a community group formed in 1982 by botanists Joan Wright and Geoff Tracey with the aim of restoring fragmented rainforest. The organisation is still going strong 40 years later. It is the largest and longest running community conservation group in the wet tropics. The nursery produces between 30,000 and 50,000 trees a year for reforestation projects on both public and private land. Their work continued even during periods of Covid-induced isolation. “During the first months of the pandemic, seeds and pots were dropped off at volunteers’ properties, and picked up later,” the president of TREAT, Angela McCaffrey, says. “Production actually went up. People were so determined to help.” Over 12 Saturdays from January to April, at the height of the wet season, TREAT volunteers plant seedlings from the nursery on sites across the tablelands. In early March, they joined a collection of organisations at Wongabel to plant mabi species on land formerly used for growing timber. The collaboration had a goal of getting 3,000 trees into the ground, about two-thirds of which came from the Lake Eacham nursery. More than 110 people turned up to the planting day, and tourists stopped to help. “People joined TREAT on the spot,” McCaffrey says. Restoration of mabi forest faces challenges not experienced in coastal forest projects. The isolation of fragments, comparatively low rainfall and even occasional frosts shape the process. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to rainforest recovery. The chief executive of NQ Land Management Services, Geoff Onus, is part of a team of scientists and community members focused on restoring the forest on the tablelands and building awareness. He is a dedicated advocate for mabi forest. “Leave a block of land dormant and the rainforest will eventually colonise and come back, but it takes a couple of hundred years for this sort of forest to gain its integrity,” Onus says. “Replanting speeds the healing. It can take 30 years off the process and give the forest a kickstart. “It’s hard yakka. It takes money and devotion from the community.” The director of Biotropica and a specialist in tropical ecosystem restoration, Nigel Tucker, points to the fragmentation of mabi forest as a problem that can only be overcome with community help. “With so little forest around, there is not much of a biological reservoir,” Tucker says. “We need to rely on the land between to build back resilience.” The land between often belongs to farms. By planting along creeks and rivers, isolated patches are linked together without impinging on high-value agricultural land. In many cases, native vegetation can improve productivity by reducing the impact of pest species on crops such as sugar cane and macadamias. The benefits are shared. These creek-side links allow animals and plants to spread between fragments. Rainforest birds are reluctant to cross open land but will travel through treed corridors. Birds bring seeds with them, taking over the restoration process that is kickstarted by community volunteers. Green threads connect fragments. At Malanda post office, a few minutes’ walk away from the Early Settlers mosaic, is another view of the tablelands. In this mosaic, adults and children are planting seedlings in a paddock. The sky is clear, and a river flows through a gap in the mountains. To one side is a marquee with burgers on a barbecue and a tea urn bubbling away. “It’s not just about conservation and putting the rainforest back,” McCaffrey says. “It’s also about the community.” Onus agrees. “Healthy environments make healthy people,” he says.",News/Environment,"In the living mosaic of the Atherton Tablelands, mabi forest is being restored",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/03/in-the-living-mosaic-of-the-atherton-tablelands-mabi-forest-is-being-restored
4/3/2022,"It’s just after 6pm on a Monday evening in the small New South Wales South Coast town of Batemans Bay, and as is the case most weeknights – especially drizzly, prematurely dark ones like this – the main shopping area is rapidly emptying. Just a handful of people remain, pushing laden trolleys down the ramp outside the supermarket in a rush to get home. Yet outside a small cinema above a shopping arcade, a procession of car headlights is nosing their way in to the car park. Standing at the entrance to the Perry Street Cinema, screen director Damon Gameau is greeting a line of people filtering in to see his new film, Regenerating Australia. An out-of-towner, Gameau doesn’t fully comprehend what an unusual sight this is – the event is sold out – but says it was like this at the previous evening’s screening in the southern highlands town of Bowral, along with the dozen or so regional Victorian towns he’s also taken the film. The film will continue its national roadshow until mid-May. “There’s just this thirst for optimistic story,” he says. “And legitimate muscular ones, not a utopian fantasy, but a sense of a vision of what we could strive for.” Gameau’s style of film-making brings together the unlikely companions of catastrophic climate crisis and hope. His 2019 documentary 2040, framed as a letter to his four-year-old daughter, explores various solutions for climate mitigation and visualises the positive scenarios he believes could eventuate if these things are rolled out at scale. The response – Gameau says crowdfunding of projects started, and two million copies of the educational materials produced with the film were downloaded – convinced him that optimism is more motivating than gloom. “If you’re going to sound the fire alarm, you’ve got to show people where the exits are,” he says. “And there aren’t enough narratives showing those exits.” Inside the cinema, attendees span all ages, from school-age children through to grey heads. There’s a local GP, an oyster farmer, and members of various local community groups. A dance troupe from the local Walbunja people of the Yuin nation perform, Wand when they greet the audience in Dhurga, a blonde-headed girl licking a choc-top yells back “Wallawani” and pumps her hand in the air. Before the film plays, Gameau talks about his vision, how “to achieve sustainability we need to regenerate”. As he speaks, calls of “yeeeew!” and “boom!” come from the crowd, the audience giving the impression of not so much being thirsty for what he has to say, but outright starving. This is a community particularly attuned to the realities of the climate crisis – the fires of 2019-2020 came within a few hundred metres of the cinema, hundreds of homes in adjoining suburbs were lost, and many other homes are exposed to coastal inundation. The film is set in December 2029. A hybrid of mockumentary and documentary, it takes the shape of a TV news report, looking back on a decade where First Nations sovereignty is recognised, a federal anti-corruption commission introduced, and Australia undergoes a rapid energy transition. The economy is booming as Australia runs on 90% renewables and exports green steel; individuals communities have energy security and cheap power from their own micro-grids; tenants lower their power bills by renting solar panels from other roofs; and electric vehicle owners earn cash by using their batteries as storage for the grid. Afterwards, in the Q and A session, it becomes clear that many ideas in a similar vein are already happening here: solar bulk buying, seaweed farming, and a “repair cafe” to encourage recycling of household products. Gameau is excited by the evidence of this kind of grassroots activity. “You look at the abolitionists, look at the human rights movement, they were all done by communities or groups of people that got together,” he says. “We’ve got to teach our leaders how to lead.” However, as one local, a man who lost his home in the bushfires and is now a climate activist, points out to the crowd, there is also a possible shortcut. While there’s some “terrific ideas and energy in the room” he says, “in the next few weeks we can make this a lot easier … the most effective thing we can do with our time in the next few weeks is letter-boxing … not for political parties, but to get local voters to prioritise climate and to think about the future they want when they vote.” Gameau thinks this groundswell of determination to act on the climate crisis that he sees in communities is inexorable – nudged along by the worsening weather. He’s noticed that interest in 2040 spikes every time there is a natural disaster. Gameau too, is feeling this nudging. His home, where his wife and daughters are now, is in the Northern Rivers, where floods have decimated communities and, even as the film plays in Batemans Bay, a new evacuation warning comes in for Lismore. “We all have had some really emotional days … my wife has really been on the frontline of this,” he says. “Obviously I spend so much time in this space and a lot of it is optimistic, but I still have days where I feel the reality of where we’re at.’ He says that in the wake of the first Lismore floods, he was on a plane when he heard the news about the record heatwave in Antarctica – with temperatures nearly 40 degrees above average – and he “just burst into tears.” While Gameau understands the catastrophic consequences of these changes to the climate, as a storyteller, he wants to keep leaning towards – in the words of America essayist, Rebecca Solnit – finding “hope in the dark”. “I think we are losing a lot of people to nihilism, or they are just tuning out and watching blockbusters and not actually engaging any more, which is really dangerous,” he says. Gameau draws inspiration from what’s known as the Stockdale paradox – a concept that comes from the experience of US naval officer, Admiral Jim Stockdale, who endured over seven years of captivity as a prisoner during the Vietnam war by simultaneously accepting the brutal realty of his situation while maintaining a robust optimism. “I think it’s so perfect for this moment,” says Gameau. “It’s this, ‘yeah, don’t shy away from the reality. It’s bleak’. But let’s also focus on all the exciting things we could do, because I think we’re going to have to regenerate regardless.” As the event at Batemans Bay ends, one woman walks out of the cinema and stretches her arms up into the night sky. “My god. I so needed that,” she says of the film. People are slow to depart, lingering in the foyer and at the top of the staircase, talking animatedly and swapping stories and phone numbers. Eventually, the cinema proprietor, broom in hand, politely tells everyone they have to go now, as he turns off the last light. “I bet you don’t have to do that when people come to see Batman,” jokes Gameau, and the cinema owner smiles and agrees.

4/3/2022,"Women escaping domestic violence say they are struggling to access a $5,000 government payment designed to help victims leave an abusive relationship. Women have reported delays and poor communication with service providers about the escaping violence payment (EVP), which has been allocated $240m as part of the federal government’s $1.3bn investment in women’s safety. Since the program launched last year, more than 7,000 applications have been made for the payment which offers up to $5,000, including $1,500 in cash to help move to safety. Rachael Humphris, a social worker with the Illawarra Women’s Health Centre, said women had faced difficulties in getting the payments quickly. She said a woman in refuge accommodation who recently applied for the payment had not heard back. “A week later, she hasn’t heard anything. This is someone in refuge accommodation with two kids looking to try and set up a life and really being in limbo and relying on a very limited income to do so. Having exhausted all of the available cash support [she’s] just running out of options,” she said. “So we just think improving on the time would really help.” The West Australian reported in February a woman had waited 12 weeks for payment, with staff resourcing issues being blamed for the delay. A spokesperson for the Department of Social Services said women who inquire about a payment will be contacted by UnitingCare network within 48 hours to go through the application process, after which a case worker is assigned to help the person through the 12-week program. The spokesperson also pointed to the upfront $500 emergency payment that is available under the program, but Humphris said that payment can be exhausted quickly through rent payments and other requirements. The department did not say how many payments had been made, but in February the government said more than $2m had been paid out. Guardian Australia has sought comment from UnitingCare. In Senate estimates in February, the social services minister, Anne Ruston, said the government was working to fix the delays. “We are absolutely going to be working to rectify these issues as soon as possible. It is a brand new program,” she said. “It’s a trial and it’s new, but we do need to make sure that we are making these turnaround times much better than they are.” The government committed an additional $240m to fund the payment in Tuesday’s budget as part of the $2.5bn investment in women’s safety in five years of the 10-year National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children. The additional funding would support up to 37,500 women fleeing violence. As part of the new funding the department would work with UnitingCare and conduct an independent evaluation to ensure the settings of the program were meeting the needs of women escaping violent relationships, the spokesperson said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The other major criticism of the payment is only $1,500 of the $5,000 is available in cash, with the rest to be spent on goods or services or paying for bonds or school fees. The department spokesperson said this was to reduce the risk of harm to women with large amounts of cash, but Humphris said women were best placed to know where to put their money and how to support themselves. “We know that that cash really gives women agency around being able to make their own choices about what the money is for, and not be limited by vouchers, so we are really keen to see an improvement to the EVP around making it [cash] support because women know what they need and need to be able to make those decisions themselves.” The Illawarra Women’s Health Centre is establishing the Women’s Trauma Recovery Centre, after the government allocated $25m in the budget over five years to the project. It will provide specialised and dedicated services for women to address the impacts of domestic and family violence, and to research recovery responses. So far in 2022, the Red Heart Campaign has recorded 32 child and women killings, with 23 classed as domestic violence. On Tuesday, as politicians were busy getting ready for Josh Frydenberg’s budget speech, the artist Dans Bain and News Corp journalist Sherele Moody, who set up the Red Heart Campaign, laid out the names of the 2,000 people who had been killed since 2008 on the lawn out the front of Parliament House. It was 30 metres long. Moody said politicians who attended, such as the Labor MP Tanya Plibersek, were shocked at the number of names. “There’s always a lot of shock and awe when people actually see the names and photos of victims together. It really brings home the reality of how widespread violence is against women and children, especially violence by people known to them – whether it’s intimate partner domestic or close associate violence like colleagues and friends and neighbours.” The government’s billion-dollar investment in the next 10-year plan comes after the House Standing Committee on Social and Legal Affairs reported in March last year that the previous plan had “not achieved its objective of a significant and sustained reduction in violence against women and their children”. “Over the life of the National Plan, governments of all jurisdictions and all political persuasions have spent over $3bn in an attempt to reduce family, domestic and sexual violence. It is clearly not for the want of trying that we as a nation have not reduced these shocking statistics that see the death of one woman on average every eight days at the hands of her partner or former partner,” the report stated. “Addressing family, domestic and sexual violence remains an urgent challenge. Behind every shocking statistic is the life of an individual, cut short or often irreparably damaged by someone who once cared for them.”",News/Australia news,"Women struggle to get federal government’s $5,000 payment to escape domestic violence",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/03/women-struggle-to-get-federal-governments-5000-payment-to-escape-domestic-violence
4/3/2022,"Australia is now racing to the line. In six weeks we could have a new government. Or not. Josh Frydenberg’s fourth budget is a gift to Scott Morrison. It plays to what are left of his strengths. Boiled down, it delivers a three-themed campaign, tailored to outer suburban and regional marginals: 1 Your job’s secure.2 We’re giving you cash.3 Here’s some cheap petrol. It allows him to say “we’re listening, we understand” about the inflationary pressures people are confronting in the vegetable aisle and the servo. Forget the entirely correct complaints that there are no reforming ideas on offer. That spending way into the future is still higher than Labor’s at the depths of the GFC. That the promises of being “back in black” have morphed into deficits for a full decade of Treasury forecasts. That billions of dollars are being wasted on pork-barrel boondoggles. The Scott Morrison of three years ago could have won with this budget. Even now, Labor is careful not to write him off. In early 2019, some Labor MPs and many buoyant staffers would privately tell you – “mate, it’s all over”. In 2022, no one says that out loud. The 10-point two-party-preferred lead Labor enjoys on Newspoll will inevitably narrow as the election closes in. The polling is an expression of anger; it is not a sure gauge of polling booth behaviour. And the budget has done all it can to blunt that anger. But the Morrison of 2022 is not the grinning newbie of 2019. Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, the Liberal senator who lost her factional fight for a winnable spot on the party’s NSW ticket, told the Senate on Tuesday he was “ruthless, a “bully…not fit for office.” Unflattering text messages from other senior Coalition figures leaked earlier this year reveal similar hostility. A second round of fatal floods in the NSW Northern Rivers, an extension of what was already in dollar terms the most expensive natural disaster in our history, reminds voters of the unavoidable costs of inaction on climate change. The mining industry can rightly claim credit for much of the boost to government revenues since December. But if more cash is coming in from coal, not much is going into speeding the transition to a lower emissions future. At least, not that we can see. There is $5.4bn listed in the budget under “decisions taken but not yet announced”. This includes an announcement still to come on Australia’s new space agency – but there’s also a line item under “Energy and Emissions Reduction.” We have little choice but to wait and see. For those taking a long-term view, the budget highlights the structural costs that are coming. Defence, rightly, is being stepped up. It needs a new kind of spending. Brutal as it is, we need more lethality at less unit price. The nuclear submarines promised under Scott Morrison’s Aukus alliance don’t even get a mention in this budget. Why would they? They’re up to two decades off. Whoever takes government after May faces fiscal traps. Josh Frydenberg has offered incentives to train an extra 15,000 aged care workers but not a dollar to pay them more. Labor rightly prioritises more money in the pocket for these most vital workers, amid deeper aged care reforms. Former NSW Liberal Premier Mike Baird, now CEO of the aged provider HammondCare, has endorsed the Labor election pledge as “a good plan.” But it locks more cost into any future Jim Chalmers budget. Meanwhile, the NDIS was conceived by the then lowly parliamentary secretary, Bill Shorten, on the back of a Productivity Commission report promising the reforms would be revenue neutral. The argument was that better support for people with disabilities would get more of them into the paid workforce and liberate personal carers, often a close relative, to get back into the economy. It was always optimistic. NDIS funding is rising into the future at more than 10% a year. Frydenberg says the NDIS will always be fully funded under a Coalition government, but it will soon exceed the Defence budget. Anthony Albanese’s Budget Reply speech hinted at even higher spending on the NDIS. At some point, perhaps under Labor, there will have to be painful reforms. Cheaper childcare - note: there is no longer talk about it being free - and 465,000 free Tafe places have to be paid for somehow. Albanese ended the week sitting pretty. The row over disputed claims of bullying of the late Kimberley Kitching by Labor senators has been muted by the spray at Morrison from Fierravanti-Wells. The pressure in 2019 was on Shorten, leaving Morrison with a free hand to spread daggy sunshine – and pension tax attacks – around the marginals. The pressure is all now on Morrison. And sometimes it shows. He’s a sitting duck to questions about bullying or ruthlessness, but he can’t afford to counter-punch without looking snappy. Often, he just looks tired. Meanwhile, Australians seem to live in a multitude of separate worlds. Business confidence is sky high. The budget papers forecast GDP growth in this calendar year of 4.75% – the same as China! When could we last say that? Consumer confidence, by contrast, is at the lowest it has been this close to an election since 1990. Morrison may take encouragement from that. Bob Hawke, then openly stalked by Paul Keating, lost the popular vote in 1990 but hung on for the win. Can Liberal campaign director Andrew Hirst do as Hawke and Graham Richardson did 32 years ago: work a marginal seats campaign that counter-balances the general mood to throw the government out? Maybe. Hawke lost eight seats in 1990, but he had a 24-seat majority from 1987. Scott Morrison has no such cushion.

4/3/2022,"My bird-watching friend Simon is telling me about the parrots he sees on his daily walks around Canberra. It is a long list, which includes five types of cockatoos. When he gets to the tenth parrot species – “red-rumps. Everyone loves those” – he stops to think. The eleventh is the rainbow lorikeet. “They’re newcomers,” he says. “And they’ve really taken off.” I find it difficult to imagine a city without rainbow lorikeets. I am in far north Queensland and they are everywhere. Street trees are filled with shrieking, whistling birds. Flocks fly past in tight formation. Everything about them is frantic – from their nectar-guzzling to their psychedelic plumage. According to BirdLife Australia’s annual Aussie Backyard Bird Count, the rainbow lorikeet is the most abundant species in the eastern states. Every year since the count began in 2014, the bird has been ranked No 1 one nationwide. But in Canberra, the species is a recent arrival. It is making up for lost time. Neil Hermes, a freelance ornithologist and the president of the Canberra Ornithology Group (Cog), has been keeping an eye on bird populations in the national capital. Long-term data collected by the Cog show lorikeet numbers rocketing. “In the 1980s, there were no rainbow lorikeets in Canberra,” Hermes tells me. “Now they’re one of the most common birds.” So where did they come from? When small numbers of rainbow lorikeets first appeared in the city, they were thought to have been aviary escapers. Cage birds might have contributed, but, Hermes says, it is highly likely that Canberra’s population grew from individuals who wandered west from the coast and found the city’s parks and gardens to their liking. Canberra’s extensive plantings of native trees and shrubs offer plenty of food and nesting sites. The Molonglo River, lakes Burley Griffin and Ginninderra, and the creeks, ponds and wetlands around the city provide a reliable water supply. “Rainbow Lorikeets are good at adapting to urban habitat and Canberra has created a large amount of new habitat,” Hermes says. “It is a fabulous city for birds. Conditions are perfect for them.” The lorikeets’ association with inland towns is made strikingly obvious by maps of sightings from the Australian Capital Territory and adjacent areas. The largest numbers are from Canberra and neighbouring Queanbeyan, followed by Yass and Goulburn, with a few records for small rural towns like Bungendore. Sightings are almost absent from the surrounding country. Decades of data show that the birds prefer to settle in built up areas. While other species suffer from the impact of urban encroachment, rainbow lorikeets belong to a small group that thrives around humans. These “urban adapters” include Australian magpies, magpie-larks, crested pigeons, noisy miners, and even eastern koels. Koels are turning up in Canberra in rapidly increasing numbers, paralleling the lorikeets’ pattern of none, to some, to many. Flying in from New Guinea and Indonesia, these migratory cuckoos arrive in spring to breed in northern and eastern Australia. The birds are difficult to spot – males are glossy black, and the females are mosaics of brown and cream – but they are easy to hear. The male’s insistent ko-el ko-el ko-el is now part of the city’s nocturnal soundscape. It might be a blessing for Canberra’s birdwatchers, but not for those species in whose nests koels lay their eggs – or for light sleepers. While some urban adapters are only reclaiming their natural ranges, rainbow lorikeets and eastern koels are extending theirs into fresh territory. Range expansion is not confined to birds. In the 1980s, grey-headed flying foxes started roosting in Melbourne, setting up a camp in the city’s Royal Botanic Gardens, about 450km west of their closest colony. By 2011, they had established a presence in Adelaide. Like lorikeets, the bats benefit from planted trees and the presence of permanent water. They are now a familiar sight in many suburbs. Individuals may turn up, but unless the conditions are right, the species – bird, bat or butterfly – cannot become established. The monarch or wanderer butterfly, native to North America and capable of flying great distances, made its way to Australia in the late 1800s. But until its food plants, tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica) and cotton bush (the gomphocarpus species), became established as garden ornamentals, it could not breed successfully. Another butterfly, the tawny coster from Asia, was first recorded in Australia in 2012. Since then, it has spread across the tropics and, in the past year or so, northern New South Wales. The tawny coster has not had to rely on parks and gardens; its principal food plant, the delicate blue spade flower (pigea enneaspermus), is native to the warmer parts of the country. In the Australian Botanic Gardens in Canberra is a deep, sheltered gully filled with luxuriant tree ferns and other rainforest plants. It is cool and damp, even in the middle of a hot dry summer when the grass crackles and the trees look as though they are dozing in the sun. Visitors to the gully might be lucky enough to see a Bassian thrush scratching through the leaf litter. This shy bird prefers dark, dense forests. “Birds are always looking for new places,” Neil Hermes tells me. “When we create them, they find them.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Here come the lorikeets!

4/3/2022,"When Sydney’s lord mayor, Clover Moore, was returned for a historic fifth term in December, not everything went her party’s way. Today, Sydney city council looks quite different from the super eight-seat majority her team predicted she’d win. With five seats to her team and five seats to other councillors, it isn’t quite a stalemate – the lord mayor casts the deciding vote. However, there are several new faces to hold Moore, one of the longest-serving mayors of a global city, to account. “The council has had a much-needed refresh; six of us are new,” Greens councillor Sylvie Ellsmore tells Guardian Australia. “Without baggage, critique can be responded to more healthily – not just shut down.” The Greens return to the council after a term away. They join a new party (Unite for Sydney, represented by Yvonne Weldon), and two new candidates for a major party (Shauna Jarrett and Lyndon Gannon of the Liberals). Guardian Australia spoke to three of the new voices on the council – Ellsmore, Jarrett and Weldon – to understand how they plan to change Sydney in the coming two and a half years. Weldon was the first Indigenous lord mayoral candidate in Sydney or, she believes, any Australian capital city. “I’m up against it, without a doubt,” she says, naming Moore’s 22 staff members in comparison to her one. “But history was made with my election, and I intend to use it by suggesting motions, asking tough questions and working with everyone.” Weldon labelled as “elitist” Moore’s plans for “giant concrete pools in the middle of the harbour”, pushing instead for urban billabongs: shallow lagoons that trace old waterways, to form a modern “Songline” through the city. It’s one way she plans on making Indigenous issues the heart of every decision. “It’s native knowledge. Aboriginal knowledge holders need to be incorporated more with decisions such as planting non-native plane trees, which cause respiratory problems for many residents,” she says. She intends to question the city’s 25 publicly owned statues – mainly early colonial leaders. Not one is of an Aboriginal person. There’s even a statue of a cat, something Weldon has said makes it “breathtakingly hard for First Nations people to feel proud”. She disagrees with the lord mayor’s office, which echoed the sentiments of Indigenous artist Djon Mundine in saying statues were “narcissistic” and “favoured by authoritarian regimes and empires”. While acknowledging a diversity of views, Weldon says many Indigenous people are calling for this. “People in the Aboriginal Land Council are asking but they’re not being heard – I’m representing their voice,” she says. As deputy chair of the new Housing for All committee, Ellsmore wants the city of Sydney – one of Australia’s wealthiest councils – to do “much more” on affordable housing. “Protecting and growing affordable housing will now be discussed monthly by all councillors.” That’s key because, she says, the council is currently not on track to meet its own targets. Her other priorities include reactivating Sydney’s community centres post lockdown and breaking down bureaucracy to pave the way for “active participation of individuals, making the council more transparent and accessible”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On those last two points, she’s an unlikely bedfellow with Liberal councillor Jarrett. “We need better continuous use of the city’s council-owned community centres such as in Pyrmont and Millers Point,” Jarrett says, adding it’s a key part of rebuilding post lockdown. “All the council’s plans are for 2030 or 2050. Those ideological strategies were written pre-pandemic; we need to readjust to prioritise bringing people back into the CBD.” Resuscitating the city’s financial centre requires supporting small to medium business owners. Their voice now largely falls to Jarrett and Gannon, after Angela Vithoulkas, of the Small Business party, lost her seat. Jarrett wants to reduce lengthy development applications to aid recovery. “It’s so people can adapt their small businesses on a street level and run them how they want to, not the way the council thinks they should.” Rumbles of discontent exist within the council about the cycleways with which Moore has become synonymous. At the first council meeting, new separated cycleways were approved for Oxford, Liverpool and King streets. But councillors Weldon and Jarrett voted against an amended motion, which was carried, to create the cycleways. Both said that they believed Moore’s cycleways plan to be hotch potch; a reference to the sudden installation of pop-up cycleways to cope with increased demand during lockdown. “It’s got to be part of an integrated plan,” Jarrett says. “It has to work with Mardi Gras for when they return to Oxford Street.” Ellsmore predicts future heat. “Cycleways will continue to be a real flashpoint of conflict between some councillors,” she says. Moore’s vision of a truly cycle-friendly Sydney rubs against the determination of some councillors to represent displeased constituents about poor parking opportunities in a car-fixated city like Sydney. This mayoral contest was historic: all six candidates were women. Five of them made it on to the council, making a total of seven women out of 10 councillors. Law professor and director of UNSW’s Pathways to Politics for Women, Rosalind Dixon, says it was wonderful to see so many women elected to the council, especially given “outrageous” 2016 comments from a former Liberal councillor who characterised Vithoulkas’s attendance at networking events as an attempt to “find a husband”. “A critical mass dispels the idea that women leaders are exceptional,” she says. “When we normalise that, we see women holding women accountable; what a great, fresh approach to politics!”",News/Australia news,New female voices set to shake up Clover Moore’s hold on Sydney city council,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/03/new-female-voices-set-to-shake-up-clover-moores-hold-on-sydney-city-council
