1/28/2022,"It is now just a week to go until the opening ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics. Beijing has spent seven years preparing to become the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Games, after it narrowly beat Almaty in Kazakhstan in a two-horse bidding process in 2015. There are 15 sports to enjoy and 109 gold medals to be won, from the thrills and spills of alpine skiing to the endurance races of biathlon and cross-country. There’s the artistic beauty of ice skating, the high-tempo discipline and risk of speed-skating, and the aggression of ice hockey to look forward to. Plus the quadrennial rediscovery that they really do use brooms in curling. And our daily briefing will be there with you every step of the way, bringing you up-to-date results, a preview of what is to come in the 24 hours ahead, and the best of the writing from our team on the ground in China.  If you are receiving this via email and weren’t expecting it, it will be because you previously signed up for our Tokyo 2020 daily briefing for coverage of the Summer Olympics and Paralympics last year. I hope you’ll want to stick with it and join me for our Winter Olympics coverage too, but we appreciate you maybe aren’t interested.

And once again Russian athletes will be competing under the neutral banner of “Russian Olympic Committee” rather than as a nation – as a result of the Wada ban for state-sponsored doping offences.

1/28/2022,"Adrian Dunbar is to lead a commemorative event to mark the 50th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday killings in Derry. The Line of Duty actor will host a weekend of talks, walks and reflections evoking what Tony Doherty described as the years “beyond the silence” from the army, police and Westminster that families faced after the killing of 13 innocent civilians by British soldiers in 1972.  Doherty, the chair of the Bloody Sunday Trust, was nine when his father was killed while taking part in a civil rights protest 50 years ago. “It is a sort of recognition of the hurt, but it’s also a recognition of the resilience of the city and the families over the years,” he said. He and other members of the trust have been appealing to all communities all week to attend or participate in events including a walk of remembrance at 9.15am on Sunday. The programme of events is designed to mark how the city has moved beyond the killings, which have left an indelible stain on British and Irish history, he said. Participants will include the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who will give the annual address to mark the event, and the president of Ireland, Michael D Higgins, who will make pre-recorded remarks. Doherty’s father, Patrick, was 32 when he was shot dead leaving six children behind, the youngest six months old. He had gone out to march with his wife Eileen who came back home a widow. Soldiers from the Parachute Regiment had shot 100 times into the crowds, killing 13 people and wounding 15. No one has been been tried for the killings despite the 12-year Savilleinquiry, which rejected the commanding officer’s claim they had acted in self-defence. Lord Saville told the BBC’s Peter Taylor last week that Bloody Sunday was a “catastrophe” that had set back peace by decades. Doherty said no one should have to wait 50 years for justice, and that along with the other families and victims of the Troubles he would continue to fight for prosecutions even in the face of proposed legislation to offer an amnesty to any soldiers or police officers involved in historic killings in Northern Ireland. “The ability to attain justice in any society is an absolute core value that should be ingrained in how society functions,” he ssaid. “These things never close. Bloody Sunday and my personal experience will always be here. The issue of justice is still very very core. It’s sort of feeling citizenship and equal citizenship and equality before the law. And we’ve never felt that.” He said Derry had healed significantly since 1972 and praised the local Democratic Unionist party councillors, the local mayor and members of the legislative assembly for engagement and bridge-building. “They say things about what is going in Derry that you would rarely find outside the city,” he ssaid. “They have a better feeling for the genuine emphasis towards sustaining reconciliation, because reconciliation isn’t an event it is a process.” There is an evolving recognition in Northern Ireland of the inter-generational trauma that children and grandchildren of victims of the Troubles can inherit from the locked-in experiences of living the aftermath. Doherty also speaks of the regret about the childhood. “I have no specific memory of the killing, but when I was growing up I was always known as ‘Paddy Doherty’s son who was murdered in Bloody Sunday’. I liked the idea of being Tony Doherty from Derry. “I sort of quietly resented that. You knew it very, very deeply and very, very clearly that Bloody Sunday was part of my identity, but it sort of, in a sense, robbed me of my own identity as as a human being.” He has hopes for his own two children who are 25 and 16. “I think among our extended families, there is a great sense of pride about what people like myself, of my age [at the time] could have achieved in the face of great adversity,” he said. “There may be an element of trauma within that which has yet to sort of reveal itself but for the most part, it registers as a sense of pride in the Derry community and what it has had to deal with over the years.”",News/UK news,Adrian Dunbar to lead events to mark 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/28/adrian-dunbar-to-lead-events-to-mark-50th-anniversary-of-bloody-sunday
1/28/2022,"Prince Andrew’s 30-year association with the Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews has ended, after the club confirmed he is no longer an honorary member. The Duke of York informed the R&A of his decision, which should remove the potential for controversy around the 150th Open due to be staged at St Andrews in July. The R&A, whose corporate wing presides over the Open, informed members of the situation on Friday morning. A spokesperson for the club in Fife said: “I can confirm that the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews has received notification that the Duke of York will relinquish his honorary membership. We respect and appreciate his decision.”  The Queen sought to distance the monarchy from Andrew by removing royal patronages – including at a number of prominent UK golf clubs – as the 61-year-old prepares to fight a civil sexual abuse lawsuit brought against him by Virginia Giuffre. A US judge rejected his attempt to have the case against him dismissed. The duke denies sexual assault allegations made against him. Andrew was the captain of the R&A in 2003 and 2004, which coincided with the club’s 250th anniversary, and has been a regular attendee at the Open. Andrew’s sister, Princess Anne, was given honorary status at the R&A shortly after the club’s 2014 decision to admit female members. A picture of Andrew driving in as captain remained on the R&A website on Friday morning. An adjacent blurb reads: “A member of the club since 1992, Prince Andrew is the only member of the royal family to have served on committee. He was a member of the Amateur Status Committee from 1999 to 2003. “The Prince drove into office on 18 September 2003 and was Captain during the year in which the Club celebrated its 250th anniversary. Describing his feelings towards the role he said, ‘It is an enormous privilege, an honour and a dream come true for me to be invited to become the Captain of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club, especially in this, its 250th anniversary year.’ “A painting, specially commissioned by the club to mark its anniversary, shows The Duke of York driving into office. Painted by Anthony Oakshett, it contains over 600 individuals and was completed in 2006.” The status of the portrait following Andrew’s relinquishing of his membership is unknown.",Sport/Sport,Relief as Prince Andrew relinquishes membership of Royal & Ancient Club,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/28/relief-as-prince-andrew-relinquishes-membership-of-royal-ancient-club
1/28/2022,"The Bloody Sunday killings cast an indelible stain on British history and scarred the life of more than 30 families and the wider communities of Derry. A later inquiry unveiled an army cover-up and led to the first apology by a British prime minister. But there have been no prosecutions.  British soldiers shot 31 unarmed civilians who had gathered for a civil rights march through the small city to protest against discrimination against Catholics in housing and employment. Troops from the Parachute Regiment fired more than 100 times, killing 13 people. One of those injured died five months later. The army claimed they were acting in self-defence. The day after, the home secretary announced an inquiry led by the lord chief justice, Lord Widgery. It was considered a whitewash by victims’ families, sitting for just three weeks in February and March of the same year with a report published in April, one of the fastest inquiries ever. It concluded there was “no reason to suppose” that the army would have opened fire unless it had been fired on first. After decades of campaigning for the truth, the families got a new inquiry in 1998. The Saville investigation lasted 12 years, the longest and most expensive inquiry in recent times. It concluded the killings were “unjustified and unjustifiable” and that “none was posing any threat of causing death or serious injury. In no case was any warning given before soldiers opened fire”. In a powerful watershed moment, the then prime minister, David Cameron, took the conclusions on board and stood in the House of Commons in 2010 to make a solemn apology for what had happened. “The conclusions of this report are absolutely clear. There is no doubt, there is nothing equivocal, there are no ambiguities. What happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable. It was wrong. “Some members of our armed forces acted wrongly. The government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of our armed forces and for that, on behalf of the government – and indeed our country – I am deeply sorry,” said Cameron. No. Eighteen former paratroopers were reported to Northern Ireland’s Public Prosecution Service over the killings but none were tried. An agreement before the inquiry opened with the attorney general meant that none of the evidence given by soldiers could be used to incriminate them at a later stage. In an interview screened last week with the BBC’s veteran journalist Peter Taylor, Saville described Bloody Sunday as “a catastrophe for Northern Ireland”, which had “put back any chance of a resolution to the Troubles by decades” and as “a very efficient recruiting sergeant”.",News/UK news,Bloody Sunday: what has happened in the 50 years since the killings?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/28/bloody-sunday-what-has-happened-in-the-50-years-since-the-killings
1/28/2022,"In 2016, Norwich-based childhood friends Rosa Walton and Jenny Hollingworth – AKA Let’s Eat Grandma – were so close that they often pretended they were twins. A lot has changed since the early days of this uncanny, left-field pop duo. Taking to the stage at a tightly packed XOYO, they have grown to be individuals, Walton in diamante-spangled blue velour, grinning, poised and assured around the stage; and Hollingworth in black, saturated with gold and silver sequins, initially a little more demure and reserved behind her synths. Two Ribbons, their forthcoming third album, finds the pair largely writing individually, laying bare growing apart and learning new parts of themselves: notably for Hollingworth, processing the bereavement of her late boyfriend, musician Billy Clayton. Still, it’s not tension or grief that hangs in the air tonight – rather, it’s love.  On the euphoric opener Happy New Year, synths pummel the air, met with the pair’s heady vocal harmonies and a cascade of firework sounds. 2018’s Hot Pink, with all its singsong chanting and thrilling, Sophie-produced whirrs and squelches, remains a wonder. But it’s when Hollingworth steps into the centre of the stage and her voice fills the room on the powerful, sprightly pop of Watching You Go, an as-yet-unreleased track that tries to grapple with some of the emotion of her grief, you can hear just how much they have grown as people and artists. Her eyes are a little glassy, but when the song ends she seems looser, and the tenderness between her and Walton shines through. None of this is to say they haven’t remained playful: spooky debut song Deep Six Textbook is still performed with handclapping routines, Walton on glockenspiel, and head movements akin to robots powering down. During proggy Falling Into Me there’s even a (quickly abandoned) attempt at the Macarena before Hollingworth runs off to do her sax solo. An abundant, glorious pop show with its heart on its sleeve, it ends on an exuberant encore of Donnie Darko. Rainbow lasers cut through the smoke machines while the pair cut loose: dance moves, a knowing flurry on the recorder from Hollingworth, arms slung around one another joyously; two sisters who have found each other again.",Arts/Music,Let’s Eat Grandma review – a sparkling testament to sisterhood,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/28/lets-eat-grandma-review-a-sparkling-testament-to-sisterhood
1/28/2022,"At least 2 million people in the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray are suffering from an extreme lack of food, with the 15-month conflict between rebel and government forces pushing families to the brink, the UN’s emergency food agency has found. In the first comprehensive assessment the World Food Programme (WFP) has carried out in Tigray since the start of the war, 37% of the population were found to be severely food insecure, meaning they had at times run out of food and gone a day or more without eating.  Families were found to be “exhausting all means to feed themselves”, with 13% of Tigrayan children under five and almost two-thirds of pregnant and breastfeeding women suffering from malnutrition. “Before the conflict we were eating three times a day but now even once a day is difficult. I was borrowing food from my family but now they have run out. We just sleep and hope we do not perish,” Kiros, a single mother of six children living on the outskirts of the region’s capital, Mekelle, told researchers. The assessment, which was based on face-to-face interviews with 980 households in accessible parts of Tigray, was carried out from mid-November until mid-December. However, researchers were unable to travel to areas where fighting is impeding humanitarian access. Moreover, since the assessment was carried out, the needs of the region are thought to have become even more acute as no aid convoy has reached Tigray for about six weeks. “This bleak assessment reconfirms that what the people of northern Ethiopia need is scaled up humanitarian assistance, and they need it now,” said Michael Dunford, WFP’s regional director for eastern Africa. “WFP is doing all it can to ensure our convoys with food and medicines make it through the frontlines. But if hostilities persist, we need all the parties to the conflict to agree to a humanitarian pause and formally agreed transport corridors, so that supplies can reach the millions besieged by hunger.” Across northern Ethiopia, where fighting has raged in the regions of Afar and Amhara as well as Tigray, WFP estimates that 9 million people are in need of humanitarian food assistance, the highest number yet. In Amhara, hunger has more than doubled in five months, it says. In Afar, where fighting has intensified in recent days between the Tigray People’s Liberation Front and forces loyal to the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, recent health screening data showed malnutrition rates for children under five were at 28%, far above the standard emergency threshold of 15%. Since the conflict erupted in November 2020, it has been difficult for the UN and other humanitarian organisations to gauge the level of need in Tigray due to a lack of on-the-ground access and telecommunications. The UN has accused the federal government of preventing food and essential medical supplies from coming into the region in a de-facto blockade. The government denies this. On Wednesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had made its first delivery of medical supplies to Mekelle since last September. The drugs are understood to have included enough insulin supplies to last about a month, after medics at the Ayder referral hospital raised the alarm over severe shortages. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director of the World Health Organization, recently accused Abiy’s government of imposing a “hell” on Tigray by denying entry to medical supplies.“It is a huge relief that this first shipment is reaching hospitals,” said Apollo Barasa, health coordinator at the ICRC delegation in Ethiopia. “This assistance is a lifeline for thousands of people, and I can’t emphasise enough how crucial it is that these deliveries continue.”",News/Global development,‘We just sleep and hope we don’t perish’: 2m in Tigray in urgent need of food – UN,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/28/we-just-sleep-and-hope-we-dont-perish-2m-in-tigray-in-urgent-need-of-food-un

1/28/2022,"Claire Fuller’s Costa prize-winning novel begins with 70-year-old Dot getting up in the night in her farm cottage and collapsing from a stroke by the kitchen hearth. Her body is found in the morning by her two adult children who face an uncertain future in the wake of her death. Twins Jeanie and Julius are 51 years old and have led desperately sheltered lives, never venturing far from home, living off the land and eschewing modern necessities such as bank accounts, television and the internet. Unsettled Ground provides a richly detailed portrait of two outsiders out of step with the world and forced to confront the lies their late mother told to keep them at home. As well as showing the siblings’ emotional implosion, Fuller depicts the harsh realities of life in a remote rural community where work is scarce and many live in dire poverty.  Reader Rachel Bavidge – who has narrated works by Paula Hawkins and Adele Parks, and Fuller’s own Bitter Orange – deftly gives voice to Jeanie and Julius, capturing their frustration and heartbreak as they realise the scale of their mother’s deception, as well as the peripheral figures who variously help and hinder their journey towards a new life. These include Dot’s old friend Bridget, who provides emotional support as the twins deal with the bureaucracy of bereavement; Spencer Rawson, the wealthy neighbour whose cottage they live in and who threatens them with eviction; and the family doctor who delivers some shocking news that causes Jeanie to reassess not just her mother but her entire existence.

1/28/2022,"At a time when some of the Premier League’s biggest names are dotted across the world, with Arsenal and Newcastle opting for warm-weather training camps in the Middle East while other players, often towing obscenely big graphite suitcases, have escaped for exotic destinations such as the Bahamas and the Maldives, the English Football League rolls on. Bernardo Silva, binoculars at the ready, has been spotting elephants and leopards on a Jeep safari in Sri Lanka and the Brentford head coach, Thomas Frank, is using the break to zigzag down ski slopes in Switzerland but for the Championship it is full steam ahead, the division ready to savour its moment in the sun. Just because there is no top-flight football this weekend does not mean there is nothing worth watching. Far from it, given that for the next generation the Championship represents a Premier League waiting room of sorts. For many, the secret is already out. Brentford have seen several bids rejected for the exciting Nottingham Forest winger Brennan Johnson and the Blackburn striker Ben Brereton Díaz’s rise has equally not gone unnoticed (he scored again for Chile on Thursday and remains on international duty). The Bristol City forward Antoine Semenyo, the Hull City centre-back Jacob Greaves, the Huddersfield pair Sorba Thomas and Lewis O’Brien and Forest’s on-loan Middlesbrough full-back Djed Spence, released by Fulham in 2018, are among those who appear capable of playing at a higher level. Luke Southwood and Nathan Baxter are goalkeepers grasping their first taste of the second tier at Reading and Hull respectively, the latter on loan from Chelsea.  Millions of fans do not need convincing, with combined attendances in the second tier totalling more than 4.5m in 2021-22 – the biggest crowd, 29,832, coming at Middlesbrough v Forest on Boxing Day – but the Premier League is where almost all 24 Championship sides pine to be and, such is the division’s unpredictability, more than half will still fancy their chances of claiming one of the three promotion places. If anything typifies the erratic nature of it all, it was the confirmation this week that Hull’s new owner, Acun Ilicali, who revealed his £30m takeover was happening while live on television presenting a Turkish adaptation of The Voice, had sacked Grant McCann despite successive victories over Blackburn and Bournemouth, who are second and third respectively. The former Rangers striker Shota Arveladze, whose last job was in Uzbekistan with Pakhtakor Tashkent, is the new manager. On Saturday Blackburn, this season’s surprise package under the wily Tony Mowbray, visit a creaking Kenilworth Road, home to Luton Town for the past 117 years. Mowbray is the definition of level-headed but even he let his guard down in midweek, punching the air after they edged out Boro, one of his former clubs. More than 1,000 away fans will clink through the turnstiles, via a portal nestled among terraced houses on Oak Road, making the pilgrimage up a steel stairwell that overlooks back gardens and washing lines before they get their first glimpse of the pitch. For Blackburn, it marks game 31 of a marathon season but others have it tougher, with Wigan and Cambridge of League One, and Hartlepool of League Two, in line to play at least 59 games owing to their progress in the FA Cup and EFL Trophy. The Championship pacemakers are a yo-yoing and free-scoring Fulham who, given the ease with which they have dispatched opponents of late (they have scored 22 goals across their past four matches and recorded two 7-0 away wins in three months), could be forgiven for already thinking about how to ensure they are at least the 17th-best team in England next season. Aleksandar Mitrovic is Fulham’s ringleader (he has scored 30 goals in 31 games for club and country this season) but others, including Harry Wilson and the Lisbon-born teenager Fabio Carvalho, who has contributed eight of Fulham’s 73 goals from attacking midfield, have also flourished. Carvalho, who joined Fulham from Balham amid interest from Chelsea and Manchester United eight years ago, is the kind of talent worth tuning in for and another example of a player who looks set to count the Championship as a key rung on the ladder to a fine career. Last season Ivan Toney and Michael Olise took their first steps in the division, excelling for Brentford and Reading respectively, and have since thrived in the top flight, the latter for Crystal Palace. Jarrod Bowen, who started his career at Hereford United, joined West Ham from Hull midway through the previous season, and Ollie Watkins and Eberechi Eze earned moves to Aston Villa and Palace a few months later. All four midfielders in the last England squad – Conor Gallagher, Jude Bellingham, Emile Smith Rowe and Kalvin Phillips – played in the Championship within the past two years and 16 of the 19 players earned their stripes at EFL clubs, including Reece James, who starred on loan at Wigan from Chelsea. Gallagher made his league debut for Charlton in the Championship before joining Swansea and Smith Rowe spent the second half of the 2019-20 campaign at Huddersfield. Phillips had six seasons in the second tier with Leeds, playing a mix of positions and for a mixture of managers. Those journeys provide obvious inspiration but for some expectations have had to be realigned and any thoughts of personal accolades put on the back burner. Surviving the season would represent success for a Derby team weighed down by a 21-point deduction and the threat of liquidation amid protracted takeover talks, while Reading are in the midst of a worrying tailspin that has left them teetering above the relegation zone and bottom club Barnsley, who have not won since November, looked doomed. The race for the play-offs, as ever, looks most intriguing, with several teams, including Coventry and Sheffield United, armed with games in hand. Forest are the flavour of the month, though – four straight wins in January, including against Arsenal in the FA Cup, showcased their credentials under Steve Cooper, a young coach with a budding reputation. On Sunday his side visit struggling Cardiff, where the former Swansea manager is guaranteed a cold reception, despite his father, Keith, a former referee, being a Cardiff fan at heart. Forest represent formidable opponents and have lost only once on the road since August, when they were bottom of the pile. In the Championship it is wise to expect the unexpected.",Sport/Football,Future stars and fluctuating fortunes: enjoy Championship’s weekend in sun,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/28/championship-future-stars-and-fluctuating-fortunes-weekend-in-the-sun
1/28/2022,"Restaurant columns don’t generally begin in the ladies’ loo for several reasons, but in real life they often do – or at least they do for me. Some time after the first plates of starters at a new opening, such as at Kibou in Battersea last week, I often find myself staring into a bathroom mirror – a freshly installed bathroom mirror, mind – and the words are already bubbling, because when you know, you already know. Kibou’s new south London branch is the third in a chain of beautifully staged, Japanese-inspired restaurants with a loyal following in Cheltenham and Bristol. The Battersea branch has two enormous, fluttery lashed, mascara-laden eyes painted on to its Hague Blue frontage. Those eyes are made prettier still by faux Japanese rose blossom. Kibou is certainly, from the outside and at night, the loveliest, quirkiest-looking new opening London has seen in a while. Inside, vast murals of Tokyo metropolitan life brighten the walls. The best seats in the house are the booths at the back, bedecked with even more faux blossom. Romantic as heck. But it’s less so if you’re seated near the front door on one of the tiny, draughty, exposed tables.  But then this restaurant is very much a place of contradictions. Kibou markets itself as a non-serious place – ideal for groups, they say – that’s deadly serious about sushi, as well as, well, many, many other things. So many dishes. Kibou’s sushi offering alone is plentiful, with a dozen types of nigiri, alongside hosomaki and futomaki rolls, gunkan, temaki and, of course, sashimi, with plates coming in around the £8 to £13 mark, and larger sharing rolls, such as the 10-piece “Volcano” – salmon, avocado and tobiko dipped in tempura – at about £18. If Kibou were solely a sushi restaurant, it could be a pleasant enough place to grab a plate of the absolutely fine hamachi nigiri or scallop sashimi, while accepting that it will arrive almost instantly and be served by someone who appears to know absolutely nothing about the menu, but is at least smiling. The menu is vast, however, and offers dozens of the crowd-pleasing, Asian-inspired dishes you see in chains such as Wagamama, Tonkotsu and Yo! Sushi. Kibou does bao buns, chicken karaage with sriracha mayo and baked aubergine nasu dengaku alongside gyoza, eel yakitori skewers and agadashi tofu, and that’s before you even get to the ramen, donburi bowls and yaki udon sections. Clearly, there’s a lot happening here, and a lot of covers to cater for, which is ambitious, and things such as agadashi tofu – which is meant to be crisp, fried soft tofu perched in an umami broth – are easy to get very wrong. At Kibou, it came in flabby lumps, thinly battered in potato starch, topped with chopped spring onion (rather than bonito) and sitting in a slightly anonymous puddle. Seconds later, teeth-chatteringly sweet, soggy aubergine nasu dengaku arrived, accompanied by a brazenly inedible “seasonal mushroom tempura” bao that sounded delicious on the menu, but turned out to be an almost raw, breadcrumbed portobello mushroom sandwiched in a very non-pillowy bao bun. Next, some overcooked chicken karaage arrived, recently refreshed in a deep-fat frier, with an unobtrusive pink mayo that was rumoured to have once met sriracha. Pale, wobbly prawn gyoza “pot stickers” arrived without even the merest of sears. It was at this point that I excused myself to go to the ladies’ room, where the towel on the old-fashioned roller dispenser on the wall had been pulled out and trailed along the floor, to have a long think about my life choices and, more specifically, about how the likes of Tonkotsu can bang out perfect chicken karaage on a mass scale, deftly and accurately at any hour of the day, and how my favourite small Korean chain Yori can offer heavenly kimchi jeon pancakes every time, regardless of who made them and when. And yet other restaurants, once they expand, have a tough time nailing their popular dishes. Even so, it is undoubted that Kibou, in its outside-London forms, at least, inspires a lot of customer love. Almost everything we ordered came in the space of five minutes, including those lukewarm eel yakitori skewers drizzled in yuzu. Fresh sea bream sashimi, served with a hostile and, for that reason, awesome wasabi, was the greatest thing on the table. I’d also ordered the yaki udon, but fortunately they forgot to bring it, because, at £92 down already and without alcohol, it felt a good time to head for the door. Kibou in Battersea has a lot of room for improvement before it will inspire the sort of adoration and dependability that it gets in its other locations, but if you’re up for a party atmosphere, cocktails, nice photographs of fake flowers and a place to take groups who won’t quibble over the details, then, in its current form, you’ll be well suited.  Kibou 175-177 Northcote Road, London SW11, 020-7223 8551. Open Tues-Sun, noon-11pm (10pm Sun).

1/28/2022,"The Guardian’s parent company has hired a former chair of Channel 4 to lead its board of directors, as part of a wider corporate restructuring at the owner of the Guardian and Observer. Charles Gurassa left Channel 4 this week after six years in the role, having spent the second half of his tenure fighting government plans to privatise the broadcaster. He will take up his new role as chair of Guardian Media Group (GMG) in March.  Gurassa’s appointment follows changes to the Guardian’s governance structure and the departure of the former chief executive Annette Thomas. GMG operates the Guardian and its associated outlets on a day-to-day basis. It is in turn owned by the Scott Trust, which is backed by an endowment fund designed to give the Guardian financial security and freedom from editorial interference by an individual proprietor. A governance review published in December found that the old relationship between GMG and the Scott Trust boards no longer suited the needs of the organisation. It concluded that while the Scott Trust would retain responsibility for appointing the Guardian’s editor-in-chief and ensuring the independence of the outlet’s reporting, its board would focus more on managing its financial endowment and making long-term investment plans. In turn, the directors of Guardian Media Group will have responsibility for overseeing the Guardian’s business strategy and appointing a chief executive to run commercial operations. As part of this change, two Scott Trust board members with journalistic backgrounds – Emily Bell and Mary Ann Sieghart – moved across to Guardian Media Group. Gurassa will take control of GMG at a time when its finances are in a healthy state and reader contributions are continuing to rise. The Scott Trust provides up to £30m a year to fund GMG’s operations but last year the company required only half of this. Gurassa’s early decisions will include the appointment of a new chief executive. In addition to Gurassa’s part-time role at the Guardian he will remain chair of the board of directors at other organisations including the aid charity Oxfam, the Migration Museum in London and the rail tour company Great Rail Journeys. He is also a trustee of English Heritage. Gurassa said: “I have been an admirer and reader of the Guardian for many years, and its purpose as an independent media organisation has never been more vital, both in the UK and globally. I look forward to working with my new colleagues to achieve the Guardian’s commercial ambitions, in support of its vital journalistic mission.” The outgoing GMG chair, Neil Berkett, who is stepping down after eight years in the job, said he had been proud to lead the organisation: “Despite the volatility the media sector has been through, the board, management team and most importantly the staff of the organisation have had many tremendous successes, turning the Guardian from a leading British newspaper and website into one of the world’s leading digital news media organisations.”",News/Media,Former Channel 4 chair appointed to lead Guardian parent company,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/28/former-channel-4-chair-charles-gurassa-appointed-to-lead-guardian-parent-company
1/28/2022,"TV. There’s a lot of it. Too much to watch, unless you have enough screens to consume 13 shows at once, like Ed Harris in the Truman Show. Between trusty old broadcast telly and the insurgent forces of Netflix, Disney, Amazon, Apple and co, there is an astronomical amount of programming currently being pumped out. And, while Succession, Squid Game and the like attract plenty of column inches, there are plenty of other shows that fall between the cracks, either by dint of appearing on a niche network or through being under-promoted by one of the giants. So this week we’re giving overdue props to five of them. And if we’ve missed any (we definitely have), feel free to let us know: more info on that at the bottom of this newsletter.  My Brilliant Friend (Sky Atlantic/Now TV) Adapting Elena Ferrante’s sprawling yet finely-drawn Neapolitan novels always seemed like an impossible task. And yet, this series – a co-production between HBO and Italian public broadcaster Rai – manages to effortlessly captures the essence of the Italian writer’s coming-of-age saga. Despite this, the series seems to largely fly under the radar in discussions about the best shows of the moment: perhaps its third series, which airs next month in the UK, may push it over the top. Pls Like (BBC iPlayer) You’ll only need a spare four hours to watch all of “greying millennial” Liam Williams’s super satire of the world of vloggers: every episode in each of its six-part series is just 15 minutes long. Last year’s third outing was the best yet, expertly skewering influencer culture, but also finding time to poke fun at pandemic-era rules and regs. The Bureau (Amazon/Sundance Now) Between Call My Agent, Spiral, Lupin and Baron Noir, French TV is en bonne condition at present. This series, about a deep cover unit (the fantastically titled Le Bureau des Légendes), is widely considered to be the best of the lot, but has barely been seen in the UK, where it is only available on Amazon’s Sundance Now channel. You’ll need to cough up for an extra subscription, but you’ll be rewarded with a fantastically taut drama that combines the better moments of Homeland with layered, Le Carré-ish spycraft. Dark Side of the Ring (All 4) It’s been a very long time since I’ve been able to watch professional wrestling with a straight face. But a documentary series about the real life stories behind professional wrestling? That’s another matter. Vice’s documentary exposes the industry’s grim underbelly with tales of addiction, corruption and even murder. At times it veers into salacious true crime territory, but it’s impeccably researched, boasts an impressive roster of talking heads, and manages to pack some truly eye-opening tales into its three seasons. Patriot/Perpetual Grace Ltd (Amazon/Starzplay) Steven Conrad is the best TV showrunner you’ve (probably) never heard of. His Amazon comedy-drama Patriot – about a wayward yet lethal, folk song-singing intelligence officer who has to go undercover in a midwest piping company – was one of the most audacious and original shows of the past decade, yet was unceremoniously dumped after two under-watched seasons. He followed it up with Perpetual Grace Ltd (available on another Amazon premium channel, Starzplay), a Coen brothers-ish neo-western which, despite starring Ben Kingsley and Luis Guzmán, ended after season one. Both are very much worth your time, and I’m also looking forward to catching Conrad’s new animated series Ultra City Smiths, which seems to be Raymond Chandler crossed with Team America.

1/28/2022,"An investigation by an EU watchdog into text messages sent by European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to Pfizer’s CEO has found the EU’s executive arm guilty of “maladministration”. Von der Leyen’s aides are heavily criticised in the ruling from Emily O’Reilly, the European ombudsman, for their handling of requests for publication of the messages sent during negotiations over vaccine purchases.  The commission initially claimed that after a thorough search it had not “identified” any text messages between Von der Leyen and Albert Bourla, whose company is forecasting revenues of $36bn (£26bn) from vaccine sales this financial year. But the EU ombudsman’s investigation found that the search carried out by commission officials for conversations by text message was restricted to an internal record of documents. Von der Leyen’s texts had not been stored there and the commission president’s personal office had not been asked if any such messages existed. The commission later claimed it did not believe that text messages were covered by the EU law regarding the requirement to store documents relating to policy as they were “short-lived”. O’Reilly said the commission’s behaviour fell short of the levels of transparency required under EU law. She said: “The narrow way in which this public access request was treated meant that no attempt was made to identify if any text messages existed. This falls short of reasonable expectations of transparency and administrative standards in the commission. “Not all text messages need to be recorded, but text messages clearly do fall under the EU transparency law and so relevant text messages should be recorded. It is not credible to claim otherwise.” The commission has now been instructed to carry out a further comprehensive search for the text messages, the existence of which was first reported in an interview with Von der Leyen about her “personal diplomacy” carried in the New York Times in April 2021. “When it comes to the right of public access to EU documents, it is the content of the document that matters and not the device or form,” O’Reilly said. “If text messages concern EU policies and decisions, they should be treated as EU documents. The EU administration needs to update its document recording practices to reflect this reality.” Von der Leyen, who was Germany’s defence minister before moving to Brussels, was engulfed in a similar scandal shortly after leaving Berlin for Brussels in 2019. She denied having anything to hide after it emerged that one of her two mobile phones being sought by a German parliamentary committee had been wiped. The committee had been investigating whether lucrative defence contracts were awarded to outside consultants without oversight and whether personal connections were behind those deals. Von der Leyen, who was later cleared of responsibility, admitted to the German parliament in 2018 that “negligence by overworked officials” had led to “mistakes” during her time in the ministry. Sophie in ‘t Veld, a Dutch MEP, said the commission had become less transparent over its decisions under Von der Leyen’s leadership and called on the European parliament to hold her to account. She said: “This is bigger than just text messaging between Von der Leyen and Pfizer. In a democracy, transparency is the cornerstone of any relationship between an executive and the legislature that checks the executive’s power. The European Commission has become less transparent, less accountable to the European parliament and frankly more unhinged from European democracy.” Pfizer has signed multiple contracts with the European Commission for its vaccine. The most recent reserved an additional 1.8bn doses, at a higher price than previously set, to be delivered between the end of 2021 to 2023 among the 27 EU member states. The commission has been criticised for the high prices negotiated for the mRNA Covid vaccines, with one analysis suggesting the EU paid €31bn (£25bn) above the cost of production. A European Commission spokesperson said on Friday that they did not have any comment to make until their formal response to the findings had been given to the ombudsman.",News/World news,EU executive rebuked for not disclosing Von der Leyen-Pfizer texts,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/european-commission-guilty-of-maladministration-over-pfizer-texts-ursula-von-der-leyen-covid-vaccine
