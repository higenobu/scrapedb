2/12/2022,"For Stuart Hogg, this Six Nations campaign is fast becoming akin to one of those anniversary tours that bands like to indulge in – a reminder of former glories, a chance to wallow in the nostalgia of early triumphs and faded youth. England’s visit to Murrayfield last weekend prompted reminders of the night Hogg’s thrilling talent was revealed with a stunning try in an A international. On Saturday it will be 10 years to the day since he made his Test debut as a replacement against Wales in Cardiff. In a fortnight, when France come to Edinburgh, exactly a decade will have passed since his first start against the same opposition. Except for the Scotland captain, it is hardly a greatest hits tour. His first four Six Nations Championship matches ended in defeat and if Hogg is still “living the dream” 10 years on from his debut as a 19-year-old, the career of one of Scotland’s greatest players still awaits a defining moment, a collective triumph to crown what has been a fine body of individual work.  Pre-tournament optimism has risen further after that opening win over England, but Scotland’s miserable record in Cardiff should temper any hint of complacency. Hogg has lost on all four of his visits and has been part of a run of 10 successive failures in the Welsh capital since their last win in 2002. The nadir was 2014 when Hogg was sent off after 22 minutes for a late hit on Dan Biggar or, as he puts it, “a bit of a brain fart and a huge amount of built-up emotion executed in the wrong way”. Trailing 10-3 at the time with 14 men, Scotland capitulated to a record 51-3 defeat. “I have grown up a lot since then,” says the 29-year-old. “Selfishly it is probably the best thing that ever happened to me. It was horrible at the time, but it was making of the man that weekend.” A naturally exuberant character, it is not in Hogg’s nature to dwell on the past, especially when the present holds so much promise. This year the thousands of Scots for whom the trip to Cardiff is one of the great Six Nations traditions – Hogg’s brother was among those piling on to buses leaving his native Hawick on Thursday – are travelling not just in hope, but expectation. Remarkably, for a team that only won seven away games – five of them in Rome – in the first 20 years of the Six Nations, victory on Saturdaytoday would be a fifth in a row on the road in the Championship. The caveat to that spectacular uplift is that the last three – in Llanelli, Twickenham and Paris – have all been achieved in empty arenas during the Covid pandemic. A raucous, pumped-up Principality Stadium, where Scotland were crushed 34-7 on their last visit in 2018, is another prospect entirely. “It’s completely different because we are going to be playing in one of the most hostile venues in world rugby,” Hogg acknowledged. “I’ve told the boys this week that if they’ve not been fortunate enough to play there yet, they’re going to get their eyes opened. It’s just one hell of an atmosphere.” Four players in the starting XV – Duhan van der Merwe, Sione Tuipulotu, Pierre Schoeman and Sam Skinner – will get their first taste of the Cardiff citadel. But there is an experienced core to this Scotland team now which, despite facing a fired-up Welsh side desperate for a restorative victory after last week’s Dublin débacle, should have enough about them to end that 20-year barren run. If so it will be the first time the Scots have won their first two matches in the Six Nations, and a first time in the championship since 1996. But too many calamities have befallen them in this fixture over the past two decades to take anything for granted. “We need to stay involved in every moment of the game, win all the small battles and make sure we grow in confidence and belief as the game goes on,” Hogg says. “We’ve got boys who now have a huge amount of experience and know how tough it is to play at the Principality. But there is confidence and belief in our squad that we can go out there and do it.”",Sport/Sport,Stuart Hogg determined to exorcise his own personal Cardiff nightmare,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/11/stuart-hogg-determined-to-exorcise-his-own-personal-cardiff-nightmare
2/12/2022,"Eddie Jones has challenged England to atone for their Calcutta Cup capitulation by channelling Muhammad Ali and leaving Italy on the canvas on Sunday. Jones has made some of the most exciting team selections of his tenure, handing starts to Harry Randall and Alex Dombrandt and omitting six of the starters who lost to Scotland. With Marcus Smith continuing at fly-half Jones believes he and Dombrandt can reproduce their formidable double act at Harlequins with the head coach urging England to “light up Rome”.  England’s starting XV has just 347 caps which is by some distance the least experienced side Jones has named in the Six Nations. In contrast, the eight replacements boast 409 caps with Ben Youngs set to equal Jason Leonard’s all-time England record of 114 provided he comes on. Luke Cowan-Dickie is also on the bench but Jones was adamant last week’s costly yellow card against Scotland did not factor in the decision. Against Scotland, Jones was criticised for his use of replacements, particularly in taking Smith off with 17 minutes to go when England led 17-10. But with Italy expected to tire as the match wears on, he has named a fearsome set of replacements and urged England’s starters to seize their opportunity before the power-packed bench delivers the knockout blow. “We want to be ruthless,” said Jones. “We’ve got a chance on Sunday to atone for what we did last Saturday. We can only do that from being really ruthless and having that vision of Muhammad Ali standing over Sonny Liston. That sort of image in your head where you want to really go at them. “When you look at the quality of our bench, it’s testament to the strength of the squad. We’ve got what would be deemed a very young and inexperienced team starting. It’s around 350 caps which is half the number of caps you need in your side to win a World Cup. We’ve got a nice blend for this game of a young and vibrant starting XV and a more worldly and experienced finishing eight. “There is the possibility the finishing eight will have the opportunity to be Ali standing over Liston. We want to be aggressive. We want to take opportunities as they come, rather than play a pattern style of rugby. We’ve really tried to create a ‘New England’ style of rugby.” Smith and Dombrandt in particular have forged a mightily effective relationship at Harlequins with Randall a similar style scrum-half to Danny Care, who slots in between them at club level. “We want to see Dombrandt play in a game that we think will really suit him,” said Jones. “Italy tend to be more open and unstructured type games so we feel that it’s a great game for him to start in at No 8. He’s not an orthodox No 8 – he’s a free-running No 8. “This is the sort of game that’s going to have a fair bit of space, so it’ll suit him. Alex runs very good inside balls from Marcus. We see that certain styles fit each other and they’ve certainly got that understanding. I’m sure that’s going to happen on Sunday.” Of Randall, Jones said: “He’s a livewire half-back, he’s very good in broken play. He’s got a good solid pass on him and his kicking game is improving.” Under Jones, England have averaged 41 points against Italy – who have lost their last 33 Six Nations matches – and a winning margin of 31. England remain the only side in the championship Italy have never beaten and are as long as 28-1 with some bookmakers to reverse that trend. England dominated territory and possession against Scotland, particularly in the first half, but Jones has now reshuffled his backline with Jack Nowell coming on to the left wing for a first start since March 2019 and Joe Marchant adopting the more familiar position of outside-centre. “These matches are called Test matches because the opposition tests you,” said Jones. “It is not a festival game. We know it’s going to be a tough game. And the players are being encouraged to be aggressive. “We feel that’s the way forward for England and we want to take opportunities and that was probably the thing that disappointed me the most against Scotland. We want to light up Rome. [Against Scotland] we didn’t take those opportunities as they availed themselves. What you can’t afford to do against Italy is get a picture in your head that it’s going to be an easy game.” Jones also praised his squad for how they have dealt with the disappointment of beginning their Six Nations campaign with a defeat for the third year in a row. “The response has been good,” he said. “They were extremely disappointed after the game. “The thing about these situations is there’s a lot of outside noise, a lot of opinions, a lot of judgment on players, and it’s important for the team to understand what is important, what we need to do rather than getting seduced by other comments. Staying committed to the team is the most important.”",Sport/Sport,Eddie Jones tells his England players to channel their inner Muhammad Ali ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/11/eddie-jones-tells-his-england-players-to-channel-their-inner-muhammad-ali
2/12/2022,"There was only one winner from the first goalless draw between Chelsea and Arsenal since 2015; the title race. Chelsea manager Emma Hayes had said that a draw or a loss in either direction would not “necessarily be defining” and, with two points still separating the WSL table-topping Arsenal and second-placed Chelsea, who have a game in hand, her prediction that the title race will go to the wire looks even more likely.  Under the floodlights Kingsmeadow, a cagey yet feisty encounter left both sides frustrated yet somewhat relieved. “I admitted after the FA Cup final that we put a bit too much focus on Chelsea and not on the way that we play,” Arsenal manager Jonas Eidevall had said before the game of the 3-0 defeat they suffered to Chelsea in December. “I think you can make a mistake once but you can’t do it twice, you do something different.” Having limped through Christmas and New Year after a blistering start to the season, Arsenal’s form seems to be improving, aided by the return of their Asian Cup cohort, plus Leah Williamson from injury and the arrival of Stina Blackstenius and defensive players Rafaelle Souza and Laura Wienroither. After Arsenal duo Vivianne Miedema and Blackstenius combined in emphatic fashion against Manchester United to earn a draw last week, Eidevall began the game with the former in the No 10 role behind the Swedish forward, while Rafaelle partnered Williamson at the back. “To get quality you need time together, that’s very important in football,” explained Eidevall prior to the game. “If you could just show players on a tactics board and go out and play then you wouldn’t need to train at all together. We’ve played 25 games so far this season and we’ve used 19 different central defender combinations.” Hayes has had her squad stretched too. Ji So Yun and Sam Kerr both competed at the Asian Cup, while injuries to captain Magda Eriksson and Beth England, Melanie Leupolz’s battle with long covid have all taken a toll. Despite the protestations of Hayes that the title would not be decided at Kingsmeadow, the mood told a different story, with the sell-out crowd rippling with expectation, the directors’ box bulging and tensions high. In the fourth minute, after full-back Jonna Andersson’s ball over the top sent Pernille Harder free, the Dane cut back to Fran Kirby but the England forward sent her shot flying over. Despite Chelsea’s fast start, with the Blues perhaps hoping to mirror their third minute goal in the FA Cup final in December against the Gunners, it was the visiting team that looked the more cohesive unit in the first half. In the 20th minute Arsenal went closest, a short corner was worked to Rafaelle at the back post and the Brazilian headed down to Miedema whose effort smacked back off the post. This was a much cagier affair than the five goal thriller edged by Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium in September, but the stakes were higher. As the break ticked closer the game began to open up a little. Blackstenius should have perhaps done better from Caitlin Foord’s ball from the left, while Kerr had a shot blocked by Rafaelle at the other end. Hayes is not known for providing a half-time hairdryer treatment, instead preferring to make tactical tweaks while her players to work out what’s gone wrong, and Chelsea returned to the field with the purpose of a side more aware that they could take the advantage in the title race for the first time with a win. With Chelsea midfielder Sophie Ingle staying tight to Miedema the fluidity of Arsenal’s play was disrupted. A double chance in the 56th minute should have put the home team ahead. Harder’s cross was swung at and missed by Kerr before Kirby’s shot was blocked. Arsenal’s solidity would be tested with Rafaelle off through injury as Chelsea pushed for the opener, with Frida Maanum on in her place and defensive midfielder Lia Walti pushed into the back line. Both teams sought the winner with gusto in the final minutes. An Arsenal freekick from Maanum in the 88th minute led to a scramble in the box, with Millie Bright and Ann-Katrin Berger both clearing off the line and, in the lengthy eight minutes of added time, the home team should have had a penalty as Niamh Charles’s cross deflected down off of the raised arm of Williamson.",Sport/Football,Chelsea and Arsenal cancel each other out in WSL stalemate,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/11/chelsea-arsenal-wsl-match-report
2/12/2022,"A Louisiana candidate for the US Senate has burned a Confederate flag in a powerful campaign ad about racial injustice in Louisiana and America. Democrat Gary Chambers is also known for a viral ad where he smokes marijuana to “destigmatize” its use and discuss the unfair policing of drug laws.  In his most recent minute-long ad titled Scars and Bars, Chambers douses a Confederate flag in gasoline before setting it alight as it hangs on a clothesline while discussing racial injustices still impacting Black Americans today. “Jim Crow never really left,” said Chambers, adding, “and the remnants of the Confederacy remain.” My new ad, ‘Scars and Bars.’Here in Louisiana and all around the South, it feels like Jim Crow never left and the remnants of the Confederacy remain.I do believe the South will rise again, but this time, it’ll be on our terms.Join us at https://t.co/EoFc59WVR1 pic.twitter.com/vTlnIy9njq Chambers goes on to discuss challenges facing Black Americans including gerrymandering and recently passed voting laws nationwide that have disadvantaged millions of Black voters. “Our system isn’t broken,” said Chambers while setting the flag on fire. “It’s designed to do exactly what it’s doing, which is producing measurable inequity.” Chambers also quoted statistics on inequalities for Black Americans: one in 13 Black people not having the right to vote, one in nine Black people not having health insurance, and one in three Black children living in poverty. “It’s time to burn what remains of the Confederacy down,” said Chambers. “I do believe the South will rise again, but this time it’ll be on our terms.” Chambers campaign ad, which has already been viewed almost 1m times on Twitter and has been retweeted over 10,000 times, was published while Louisiana legislators are working to redraw the state’s congressional districts. Chambers and others are advocating for majority-Black districts in the state to be expanded and better reflect Louisiana’s Black population, which makes up about one-third of the overall population. Chambers led a rally on Louisiana’s capitol steps about the congressional maps on Wednesday morning. “Our ads are representative of Gary’s passion to raise awareness for the issues that leave the often forgotten communities in this country behind,” said Erick Sanchez, a senior adviser to Chambers who has worked on both ads, to the Washington Post. “While the imagery might be deemed controversial by some, the harsh realities that are highlighted in these ads should be infuriating to all.” Though Chambers’ campaign team did not answer questions from the Post on if the ads had generated more donations (Chambers’ opponent, Republican incumbent senator John Kennedy has outpaced him in terms of funding), Chambers has shared nothing but enthusiasm at his campaign. “We will continue to build momentum around this nation to make change in Louisiana,” tweeted Chambers on Wednesday.",News/US news,Louisiana candidate burns Confederate flag in his latest controversial ad,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/11/gary-chambers-louisiana-senate-candidate-confederate-flag
2/12/2022,"Wretchedness, sadness and confrontational grotesquerie once again come together in a movie by Ulrich Seidl, although it’s leavened by something almost – but not quite – like ordinary human compassion. If you’ve seen Seidl’s other movies you’ll know what to expect and you’ll know to steel yourself for horror. Perhaps this one doesn’t take Seidl’s creative career much further down the road to (or away from) perdition, but it is managed with unflinching conviction, a tremendous compositional sense and an amazing flair for discovering extraordinary locations. The Italian coastal resort of Rimini in winter is an eerie, melancholy place; Seidl shows it in freezing mist and actual snow. Refugees huddle on the street and some groups of German and Austrian tourists take what must be bargain-basement package vacations at off-season rates in the tackiest hotels. It is here that Ritchie Bravo, played by Seidl regular Michael Thomas, plies his dismal trade. He is an ageing lounge singer with a drinking problem, a cheery, bleary style, an Islamophobic attitude, a bleached-blond hairdo of 80s vintage and a spreading paunch. Ritchie makes a living crooning to his adoring senior-female fanbase, who show up in their coach parties to catch his act. (You could compare him to Nick Apollo Forte in Woody Allen’s Broadway Danny Rose or Gerard Dépardieu in Xavier Giannoli’s The Singer – except much, much more horrible.) He also tops up his income by having sex with some of the fans for money – truly gruesome scenes in the starkly unforgiving Seidl style.  But Ritchie has reached a personal crisis. He has to go home to Austria when his mother dies and he is reunited with his brother Ewald (Georg Friedrich). His father, Ekkehardt (played by Hans-Michael Rehberg, who died in 2017 shortly after filming his scenes) suffers from dementia and now does not understand that his wife is dead. This lonely, stricken figure is awarded the film’s final desolate moments. But, most traumatically, back in Rimini, Ritchie is confronted with long-alienated grownup daughter Tessa (Tessa Göttlicher), who angrily demands money from him as recompense for the way he abandoned her and her mother years before. Crucified with guilt, and galvanised by family feeling after the funeral, Ritchie sets out to get Tessa her money – which means embezzling the cash out of his addled dad’s bank account and videoing his sex sessions with his tourist clients for blackmail purposes. It doesn’t end well. That hardly needs saying. His reunion with Tessa is to be the instrument of his gruelling punishment: he is guilty and deserves everything that’s coming to him, except in Seidl’s world you get the sense that horrible things would happen to him even if, or especially if, he didn’t behave badly. There is torment for everyone, including the audience. There is a kind of brilliance in it.
