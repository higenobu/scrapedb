2/14/2022,"Even those who might not immediately have recognised the name of John Williams, who turned 90 this week, will know his work – and many of these won’t just know it, but respond viscerally to it, as we do to childhood smells, or the pop songs of our teenage years. Over a 64-year career he has composed orchestral music for, among many other things, the Star Wars films, Superman, the first three Harry Potter films, Home Alone and 28 of Steven Spielberg’s movies, including Jaws, Jurassic Park and ET. Given the global and generational reach of these movies, Williams has a fair claim to have been heard by – and moved – many millions of people on this planet. The use of orchestral scores harks back to the 1930s and has, despite the vast range of what is aurally possible in 2022, never gone away. Some people look down on such compositions – perhaps because the work can be so emotion-on-sleeve; so partial to a recognisable tune; so unpreciously productive; and so extremely successful. But Williams’s music, for instance, earns serious respect from the musicians who play it, who understand both the virtuosity it demands, and the difficulty of creating seemingly simple but unforgettable leitmotifs. Music written for the movies, such as William Walton’s score for Laurence Olivier’s Henry V, or Vaughan Williams’s for Scott of the Antarctic (which became his Symphony No 7, Sinfonia Antartica), or Philip Glass’s for Koyaanisqatsi, is played in concert for its own sake. There is a strong argument, too, that the movie industry has been an important patron of both orchestras and original orchestral music over the last century.  And yet perhaps there is still a difference. The film critic David Thomson has made the case that movie music “is not what we call real music”: the difference is, he argues, between something like Mahler’s Fifth, which “is sadness”, and the overture for Gone With the Wind, which says “get ready for a mighty story of sadness and glory”. There is probably a sense of mischief and provocation in this – it would be hard to argue that Miles Davis’s score for Louis Malle’s Lift to the Scaffold, for example, wasn’t real music – but it does make the point that this music is meant to go with something. The best movie music works on three levels – as the immediately obvious surface tune; then, underneath that, as a kind of counterpoint working either deliberately against or with a scene, maybe even telling a different story altogether; and finally, in a way so deep even the most sophisticated moviegoer can’t necessarily work out what’s going on. Emotional coercion has limited value; most successful is music that, in the words of Hans Zimmer (The Lion King, 12 Years A Slave, Thelma & Louise) “opens the door that you can walk through”. “Used properly,” as the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky put it, “music does more than intensify the impression of the visual image … it opens up the possibility of a new, transfigured impression of the same material; something different in kind.” A film score is like an instrument in a greater orchestra that includes not only what is happening on screen but also the audience, each element listening and responding to and enhancing each other, whether they know it or not.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on John Williams and movie music: a complex magic | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/13/the-guardian-view-on-john-williams-and-movie-music-a-complex-magic
2/14/2022,"Britain believes that Russia’s powerful FSB spy agency has been given the task of trying to engineer coups in Ukraine’s major cities in the immediate aftermath of any invasion launched by the Kremlin. The assessment is that an attack would see Russia strike first against military targets, then encircle the capital Kyiv and possibly other major cities, with FSB saboteurs then expected to try to install pro-Russian leaderships within.  No specific evidence has been put forward to justify the two-step plan, but it is nevertheless considered by the UK to be a central invasion scenario, aimed at “regime change” in Ukraine, in which Russia would seek to avoid bloody and high-risk urban warfare after an attack on its neighbour. Britain and the US both believe that Russia has now assembled a force capable of invading Ukraine after massing more than 135,000 troops around its borders. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said over the weekend he believed an attack was now “highly likely” and cut short a family holiday. Both western countries have made a string of intelligence-led warnings about Russia’s intentions towards Ukraine in recent weeks, including that the Kremlin is planning “false flag” operations as a pretext for invasion, and that a group of five mostly former Ukrainian politicians had been recruited to participate in a coup. Some have been received critically in Kyiv and elsewhere. Four of the five Ukrainian politicians are now based in Moscow, making their Russian ties a matter of public record, while the fifth, former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev, said he was banned from Russia and there was “no public evidence” he was involved. Russia denies it has any plans to attack its southern neighbour and has called western warnings “hysteria”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has also sought to play down the likelihood of an invasion, saying on Saturday: “Right now, the people’s biggest enemy is panic.” There is also scepticism in Ukraine that it would be possible to install any pro-Russian leadership in Kyiv and its other major cities, even in the context of a military incursion, given the broad public hostility to Moscow in the country. But western sources fear that President Vladimir Putin has not appreciated the depth of popular opinion in Ukraine. “A lot of over-optimistic assessments are being fed all the way to the top of the Kremlin,” one official said. A similar multi-step plan was highlighted by Germany’s Bild tabloid earlier this month, based it said on a foreign secret-service source. The newspaper went on to say Russia would then seek to appoint a pro-Kremlin parliament and round up Ukrainian activists and opposition leaders. In response, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Bild had “crossed all possible lines of human, genuine morality and ethics”. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence agency and others have repeatedly exposed evidence of FSB interference in the country since the start of the war with Russia in 2014. Late last year, the SBU said it had discovered a plot to smuggle explosives into the country from Russian-occupied Crimea. Zelenskiy said at the end of November that a coup plot had been discovered, which officials added was being planned by an FSB officer and defectors of Ukraine’s interior ministry who had moved to Crimea. Responsibility for Ukraine within the FSB lies with its fifth service, responsible for intelligence operations in former Soviet states. Its leader is Sergei Beseda, who was placed on US, EU and UK sanctions lists in 2014. Beseda was wanted by Ukraine for questioning in the aftermath of the anti-Russian Maidan revolution in February 2014, believing he was part of a failed attempt to take control of violent efforts to suppress the popular protests. Moscow said he was present to help ensure the protection of the Russian embassy during a time of uncertainty.",News/World news,"Russia’s FSB agency tasked with engineering coups in Ukrainian cities, UK believes",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/13/russias-fsb-agency-engineering-coups-ukrainian-cities
2/14/2022,"The creation of the NHS Race and Health Observatory, which has compiled a devastating review of inequalities suffered by people of colour within the health system, came after it emerged that people from different minority ethnic groups were at higher risk of dying from Covid. According to an Office for National Statistics analysis, black people were four times as likely as white people to die from coronavirus early in the pandemic. Many explanations were put forward for the disparities, while people of colour were over-represented among Covid patients in intensive care units. These included them being more likely to be key workers in face-to-face roles – the fact that the first 12 doctors to die of coronavirus were people of colour was an early alarm bell signalling unequal risks. Another theory was that some minority ethnic groups are more likely to live in multigenerational households.  But another contributing factor was health inequality. While Covid – and the Black Lives Matter movement – may have shone a light on them, they were by no means previously unknown. The fact that the observatory pored over 178 studies, dating back a decade, illustrates that health inequalities were no secret among those charged with maintaining the nation’s health. Long before Covid, it was known that there was a higher prevalence of heart disease, diabetes and kidney disease among certain minority ethnic groups. The race disparity audit published in 2017 under Theresa May’s government showed that most Asian groups expressed lower levels of satisfaction and less positive experiences of NHS services than other minority ethnic groups. Additionally, black women were the most likely to have experienced a common mental disorder such as anxiety or depression in the previous week, and black men were the most likely to have experienced a psychotic disorder in the past year. However, white Britons were more likely to be receiving treatment for a mental or emotional problem than adults in other groups. However, rather than taking up the baton of change presented by his predecessor, Boris Johnson’s government disbanded the race disparity audit advisory unit and set up its own commission to come up with new findings on racial inequalities. In its report, published in March last year, the Sewell commission was accused of glossing over health inequalities and the reasons for them while downplaying structural racism generally. NHS Providers was among those who challenged the commission’s findings, saying “to pretend that discrimination does not exist is damaging as is denying the link between structural racism and wider health inequalities”. The observatory not only identifies inequalities in every area of healthcare it reviewed but says that these have long been known about – yet there has been a failure to act. Many of their findings will come as no surprise to healthcare workers, particularly those of colour, who have long complained of racism within the NHS, suffered by patients as well as staff. Workforce inequalities are also covered within the observatory’s review. Having provided an incisive analysis of the nature and scale of health inequalities within the NHS, the next challenge is for the review to prompt sure and substantive action. Otherwise it will be just another addition to the litany of papers that have identified health inequalities, albeit one of unparalleled depth and expertise. Health inequalities are not only unjust but also cost the NHS and economy money. As under-resourced and overstretched as the organisation is, having backed the creation of the observatory it is in everyone’s interests – including those of the government – for it to act on the independent body’s recommendations.",News/Politics,NHS race review should be cue to finally tackle health inequalities,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/13/nhs-race-review-tackle-structural-health-inequalities
2/14/2022,"Radical action is needed urgently to tackle “overwhelming” minority ethnic health inequalities in the NHS, leading experts have said, after a damning study found the “vast” and “widespread” inequity in every aspect of healthcare it reviewed was harming the health of millions of patients. Racism, racial discrimination, barriers to accessing healthcare and woeful ethnicity data collection have “negatively impacted” the health of black, Asian and minority ethnic people in England for years, according to the review, commissioned by the NHS Race and Health Observatory, which reveals the true scale of health inequalities faced by ethnic minorities for the first time.  “Ethnic inequalities in health outcomes are evident at every stage throughout the life course, from birth to death,” says the review, the largest of its kind. Yet despite “clear”, “convincing” and “persistent” evidence that ethnic minorities are being failed, and repeated pledges of action, no “significant change” has yet been made in the NHS, it adds. The 166-page report, seen by the Guardian, is due to be published in full this week. From mental health to maternity care, the sweeping review led by the University of Manchester paints a devastating picture of a healthcare system still failing minority ethnic patients despite concerns previously raised about the harm being caused. “By drawing together the evidence, and plugging the gaps where we find them, we have made a clear and overwhelming case for radical action on race inequity in our healthcare system,” said Habib Naqvi, the director of the NHS Race and Health Observatory, an independent body established by the NHS in 2020 to investigate health inequalities in England. The Covid pandemic has taken a disproportionate toll on ethnic minorities, prompting fresh questions about inequalities that permeate the practice of medicine. The observatory ordered the review last year to synthesise the evidence, translate it into “actionable policy” and “challenge leaders to act”. “This report is the first of its kind to analyse the overwhelming evidence of ethnic health inequality through the lens of racism,” said Naqvi. Its findings are shocking. The review concludes that inequalities in access to, experiences of, and outcomes of healthcare in the NHS “are rooted in experiences of structural, institutional and interpersonal racism”. For “too many years”, it adds, the health of minority ethnic people in England has been “negatively impacted” by a lack of appropriate treatment, poor quality or discriminatory treatment by NHS staff, missing ethnicity data from NHS systems, and delays in seeking help for health issues “due to fear of racist treatment from NHS healthcare professionals”. The year-long review, which examined 13,000 papers and interviewed policy experts, NHS staff and patients, was led by Dharmi Kapadia, an investigator at the Centre on the Dynamics of Ethnicity, the UK’s leading research centre into minority ethnic, racial and religious inequalities. Kapadia, a sociology lecturer at the University of Manchester, said she and her co-authors had uncovered “crucial” evidence of persistent health inequalities that were harming the health of patients on a daily basis. “The evidence on the poor healthcare outcomes for many ethnic minority groups across a range of services is overwhelming, and convincing,” she said. The report is littered with striking examples and evidence of inequity in the NHS. In mental healthcare, for example, the review found minority ethnic patients faced “clear inequalities” in regard to Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT), a flagship NHS programme set up in 2008 to transform the treatment of anxiety and depression in England. Minority ethnic groups were less likely to be referred to IAPT by GPs than white people, the report said. Minority ethnic patients who do get a referral are less likely than white British patients to receive an assessment. Minority ethnic people with psychosis are also less likely to be referred for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The review found “strong evidence” of “clear, very large and persisting ethnic inequalities” in compulsory admission to psychiatric wards, particularly affecting black people. It uncovered evidence of harsher treatment for black patients, who were “more likely to be restrained in the prone position or put into seclusion”. Minority ethnic parents reported their children faced the same barriers to accessing health services as they did. Black children are 10 times more likely to be referred to children and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) via social services – rather than through their GP – compared with white children, the report says. Maternity services were also found lacking. The review found evidence of negative interactions, stereotyping, disrespect, discrimination and cultural insensitivity, leading to some minority ethnic women feeling “othered”, unwelcome, and poorly cared for. Some women whose first language was not English were denied access to quality interpreting services, the report adds. “Our review shows the role of structural barriers – including racism and experiences of racial discrimination – in patterning stark ethnic inequalities in healthcare,” said its co-author Laia Bécares, a senior lecturer in applied social science at the University of Sussex. The review found a lack of research in specific areas. Despite screening 10 years’ of research, the review team found only one study that examined health inequalities in the care of newborn babies. It showed Asian babies are over-represented in admissions to neonatal units from home for jaundice. Visual estimation of jaundice in babies “may be particularly unreliable” for babies with darker skin tones, the review said, raising the possibility that “routine postnatal care practices may systematically disadvantage non-white babies by delaying access to care”. The researchers also said any efforts to improve health outcomes among minority ethnic patients were being thwarted by the shambolic collection of health information by NHS staff and organisations. Racism within the NHS workforce persisted, they said, and the report found evidence of an pay gap affecting black, Asian, mixed and other groups. The review also uncovered minority ethnic health inequalities in areas as diverse as digital access to healthcare, genetic testing and genomic medicine. “Persistent inequalities in the healthcare and health outcomes between ethnic groups remain, despite past commitments to address the issue,” said its co-author Sarah Salway, a professor of public health at the University of Sheffield. “As a nation we are proud of our NHS. It is one of the few healthcare services worldwide that enjoys a reputation for quality care that is free at the point of access, so it can be difficult to discuss how things may be failing. This report, however, gives us the opportunity to identify how we can do things better, for a healthier and fairer society.”",News/Society,"Radical action needed to tackle racial health inequality in NHS, says damning report",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/13/radical-action-needed-to-tackle-racial-health-inequality-in-nhs-says-damning-report
2/14/2022,"Beryl Vertue, who has died aged 90, played an important role in the history of British television comedy. She began as an agent for writers such as Spike Milligan and Eric Sykes, as well as the performers Tony Hancock and Frankie Howerd, before pioneering the sale of hit UK TV formats to American television. When she turned to producing, her first big sitcom success was Men Behaving Badly (1992-98), which ushered in an era of laddish humour. She read the 1989 novel by Simon Nye, who was working as a translator for Credit Suisse, saw its potential and set him off on a TV career. Martin Clunes starred as Gary, sharing a flat with Dermot (Harry Enfield) – replaced by Neil Morrissey as the womanising Tony after the first series – and Caroline Quentin played Gary’s girlfriend, Dorothy, with Leslie Ash as Deborah, Gary’s neighbour, who is attracted to Tony but put off by his immaturity.  Vertue had to use her persuasive powers with ITV to keep the show going when Enfield left. Then, at the end of the second run, the channel dropped the programme because Thames Television, which commissioned it from Vertue’s independent production company, Hartswood Films, lost its broadcasting franchise. She simply phoned the BBC, which ran it for a further four series – at a later broadcast time, allowing for more rowdiness and locker-room language. Another audience-pleaser from Hartswood was Coupling (2000-04), about the sexual adventures of a group of six friends. Jack Davenport, Sarah Alexander and Ben Miles were among the stars in a sitcom written by Steven Moffat and based on the evolution of his own relationship with his wife, Sue (Vertue’s daughter), who produced the programme while her mother oversaw it as executive producer. As with Men Behaving Badly, Vertue sold the format to American television. The Moffat-Vertues partnership had further success with two drama series transposing Victorian literary figures to the present day. Jekyll (2007) starred James Nesbitt as Robert Louis Stevenson’s doctor with a split personality, while Sherlock (2010-17) was an irreverent take on Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective, co-created by Moffat and Mark Gatiss, with Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes and Martin Freeman as Dr Watson. Cumberbatch dubbed Vertue “Sherlock’s godmother”. She was born in Croydon, Surrey, to Elsie (nee Francis), and Frank Johnson. On leaving Mitcham county school, Beryl started her working life as a secretary in a shipping firm. When, in 1954, she was in hospital recovering from tuberculosis, a schoolfriend, Alan Simpson, and his Hancock’s Half Hour writing partner, Ray Galton, visited her and said they wanted a secretary at Associated London Scripts, the cooperative they had just formed with Sykes and Milligan. She joined them the following year. From typing scripts for The Goon Show (1951-60) and other radio and TV sitcoms, Vertue became the company’s business manager – later managing director – and negotiated deals with broadcasters. This made her an agent for some of the most respected writers in the country, who also included Barry Took, Dick Vosburgh, Marty Feldman, John Junkin and Johnny Speight. Outside comedy circles, Vertue sealed a deal for Terry Nation that gave him partial copyright on the Daleks when he introduced them in Doctor Who’s second story shortly after the sci-fi series began in 1963. She also blazed a trail by persuading the BBC to venture into programme-related merchandise, resulting in Daleks memorabilia, a Hancock’s Half Hour board game and Steptoe and Son jigsaws. When the impresario Robert Stigwood – manager of the bands Cream and the Bee Gees – bought out Sykes’s and Milligan’s controlling interest in the writers’ agency in 1967, he formed a production arm, Associated London Films, and Vertue added “executive producer” to her CV. The first release to bear fruit was the slapstick wordless short film The Plank (1967, later remade for television), with Sykes starring, writing and directing. However, cinema versions of TV sitcoms became the production company’s forte, from Till Death Us Do Part (1968) to Up Pompeii (1971) and Steptoe & Son (1972). Alongside film production, Vertue negotiated the sale of British sitcom remake rights to American and European channels. In the US, Till Death Us Do Part became All in the Family (1971-79) and Steptoe and Son was retitled Sanford and Son (1972-77). Associated London Films closed after eight years, but she continued with the Robert Stigwood Organisation as executive vice-president and produced programmes for American television. These included Beacon Hill (1975), a Boston-set version of Upstairs Downstairs, and The Entertainer (1975), starring Jack Lemmon as Archie Rice in the John Osborne play. She was also executive producer of Tommy (1975), the film of the Who’s rock opera, and – a year after becoming co-deputy chair of Stigwood’s company – The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1978), an ITV series based on Muriel Spark’s novel, a collaboration with Scottish Television for which she also handled foreign sales. As Stigwood started winding down his TV operation, Vertue set up Hartswood Films in 1979 and spent much of the next decade looking for a winning formula. Codename: Kyril (1988), a four-part cold war spy drama starring Edward Woodward and Ian Charleson, was the only one until Men Behaving Badly came along. Although Vertue made other dramas, such as A Woman’s Guide to Adultery (1993), The English Wife (1995) and Wonderful You (1999), she continued producing sitcoms, including My Good Friend (1995-96), written by Bob Larbey and starring George Cole, and Is It Legal? (1995-98), Nye’s solicitors’ office saga. In the new millennium, she took an executive producer role to encourage new talent at Hartswood on comedies ranging from The Savages (2001) and Carrie & Barry (2004-05), both from the pen of Nye, to Supernova (2005-06) and Me and Mrs Jones (2012), as well as the comedy-drama series Border Cafe (2000) and Lady Chatterley’s Lover (2015). Vertue was made an OBE in 2000 and a CBE in 2016, and presented with the Royal Television Society’s lifetime achievement award in 2012. Her 1951 marriage to Clements Vertue ended in divorce. She is survived by Sue and another daughter, Debbie, director of operations at Hartswood Films.

2/14/2022,"The UK’s reliance on gas to heat homes, generate electricity and fuel heavy industry has come at a steep cost, which is expected to keep on rising. In recent weeks the financial hit to household incomes has reignited calls for the UK to move more urgently to break its dependence on fossil fuels in favour of homegrown low-carbon energy sources.  If UK homes were better insulated, warmed by low-carbon alternatives and powered by renewables then bill payers would be better off, according to experts. The cost of supporting the UK’s green policies is falling fast too. Green levies, including support for social schemes, renewable subsidies and energy efficiency, tumbled from £186 on the average annual energy bill under the energy regulator’s summer 2021 cap on standard energy tariffs to £173 over the winter, according to analysis by industry journal Carbon Brief. Under the next energy price cap, which is set to surge to an average of almost £2,000 a year from April, policy costs will fall to £155, according to the analysis. So can going green help keep a lid on home energy bills as well as carbon emissions? Here are the top ways the UK can guard homes against future gas market shocks while tackling the climate crisis too. Generating more electricity from renewable energy is a guaranteed way to avoid firing up gas power plants and protecting electricity bills from gas market shocks. Under the government’s scheme to support renewable energy projects, windfarms and solar panels receive payments from household energy bills to top up the earnings from the energy market to an agreed level, or “strike price”. But in return they are expected to pay cash back to consumers when market prices surge above this set subsidy level. Over this winter, renewables covered by the scheme are expected to generate enough electricity to pay back £770m, which would save an average of £27 from the annual home energy bill. The UK’s existing pipeline of renewable energy projects, which are expected to be under construction until 2023, could save households up to £3.9bn in the future, according to analysis by energy company SSE, or enough to shave £140 off the average bill. The savings could be even higher if the growth of renewable energy sources meant the UK could significantly cut the volume of gas required by the electricity system, and reduce Britain’s exposure to the whims of the global energy markets. Better insulation means cheaper energy bills and lower carbon emissions. But the government’s faltering commitment to upgrading Britain’s draughty homes – considered the least efficient in Europe – has left millions of homes exposed to unnecessarily high heating bills. Research undertaken by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit has found that homes with energy efficiency band D typically use 13,200 kWh of gas a year, which costs £630 under the regulator’s current price cap, or £100 more than homes insulated to band C level, which is the level targeted by government. The saving is expected to widen from April as the energy price cap rises, reaching £170 while the costs for homes insulated to band D climb to £340. The least energy efficient homes in the UK – in which many households are living in fuel poverty – typically pay £240 more a year to heat than band C homes. Those living in homes rated F are expected to pay £400 a year more on their heating bills from April than bill payers in a C grade home, which could be transformed into savings if energy efficiency improved. The findings have renewed calls for the government to use public money to help make home insulation affordable, which would help cut home heating bills and move the UK towards its legally binding climate targets. About 85% of British households rely on gas heating to stay warm. But in the future homes that are well insulated and connected to an electricity system rich with renewable energy could enjoy energy bill savings by switching to an electric heat pump. Electricity bills are not rising as fast as gas bills because gas power plants make up about half of the UK’s generation mix while renewable and nuclear energy generation helps to cushion the rising cost of electricity. Under the regulator’s energy price cap a default electricity-only tariff is poised to climb by 42% from April while gas bills will rise by 69%. By the end of the decade paying for power could be even cheaper because the green levies that are currently collected through electricity bills – and stand at £153 a year – may be moved to gas bills under new proposals from the regulator. The catch? The cost of buying and installing a heat pump has fallen, but remains a hefty investment for most families particularly as a cost of living crisis looms. Heat pumps also rely on good home insulation and skilled installation to run effectively. The government’s climate agenda would need to help households find affordable options to help accelerate the rollout of heat pumps – including good training options for new installers – if bill payers are to reap the benefit. The energy industry has struggled for years to make the case for installing a smart meter, but soon the rollout of a new generation of energy tariffs and digitally enabled appliances could convince the doubters that it is savvy to go smart. By opting for a so-called “time-of-use” tariff households could save money on their energy bills by running a load of laundry or the dishwasher during periods when energy is cheap, and avoiding times when energy is most expensive. Smart home appliances, electric vehicles and batteries could automatically pick the best time to charge up overnight, which would make saving money even easier. Octopus Energy, a leader in time-of-use tariffs, has found that the average customer using its Agile tariff would save £188 a year by avoiding energy use during peak “surge pricing” periods compared with using a standard variable tariff. But the even bigger benefits for households take place well beyond the front door. By using less electricity during peak demand hours, and making better use of renewable energy during low demand hours, the energy system could avoid investing billions in new power plants and grid connections, which are ultimately paid for through home energy bills. A study by Imperial College London and the Carbon Trust found that the UK could save up to £8bn a year by 2030 by using a more flexible electricity system. The study found that shifting how we use electricity, using more energy storage and trading electricity with neighbouring countries via giant subsea cables could save up to £40bn by 2050 – even after taking into account the cost of these investments.",News/Business,How the UK can cut carbon emissions and reduce household energy bills,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/13/how-the-uk-can-cut-carbon-emissions-and-reduce-household-energy-bills
