2/13/2022,"A man landing an upper-cut on the ceiling fan, a woman slamming into furniture, a guy smashing through a lighting fixture: gamers are learning, virtual reality headsets can often cause havoc at home. The trend of crashing into furniture while in the metaverse provoked a 31% jump in home contents claims involving VR headsets last year, insurer Aviva said, marking a 68% overall increase since 2016.  “As new games and gadgets become popular, we often see this playing through in the claims made by our customers,” said Kelly Whittington, Aviva’s UK property claims director. “In the past we’ve seen similar trends involving consoles with handsets, fitness games and even the likes of rogue fidget spinners.” Aviva said the average VR-related claim for accidental damage in 2021 was about £650, often from broken TVs smashed by overenthusiastic gamers. Claims to Aviva involving virtual reality headsets can get wacky. One customer launched a controller at his TV when a zombie jumped out during the game. Multiple people reported cracking TV screens. One child smashed two designer figurines – perched on the mantelpiece – when his game demanded a “swipe” move. All three claims were accepted and settled, an Aviva spokesperson told the Guardian. “These devices can be a great source of fun, but we’d encourage people to be mindful of their surroundings and take a look at their home insurance to make sure it suits their needs,” Whittington added, urging people to add accidental damage cover to their home insurance plan. Aviva said that, with many people in the UK receiving VR headsets over Christmas, claims in 2022 are already coming in and the company expects more. The Reddit forum “VR to ER” features of videos of people using VR headsets falling over, bumping into furniture or accidentally punching loved ones. While those with damaged homes may not see the funny side, commenters are finding humour in the trend. Commenting on the upper-cut video, one person said: “Looks like the guy knocked its lights out.” Another person, writing under a video of a woman body-slamming furniture, commented: “Never heard a house scream like that before.”",News/Technology,Rising popularity of VR headsets sparks 31% rise in insurance claims,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/12/rising-popularity-of-vr-headsets-sparks-31-rise-in-insurance-claims
2/13/2022,"Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin talked by phone for over an hour on Saturday in what is widely seen as a last-ditch effort to fend off a Russian invasion of Ukraine which the US has warned could start as early as Wednesday. The White House said that the Kremlin had suggested the call and Biden had accepted, and it began shortly after 11am Washington time, ending just over an hour later.  A statement said that during the call Biden made clear if Russia undertakes a further invasion of Ukraine the US and allies “will respond decisively and impose swift and severe costs on Russia”. It added that the US was “prepared to engage in diplomacy” but “are equally prepared for other scenarios”. Earlier in the day, Emmanuel Macron held a separate conversation with the Russian leader, which was reported to have lasted one hour and 40 minutes, in which the French president said a “sincere dialogue” was incompatible with the escalating tensions, as Russia continued to move troops from staging areas to positions closer to the border. Moscow did not immediately publish its version of the call. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, also talked to his counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, earlier on Saturday to call for “a diplomatic resolution to Russia’s unprovoked military buildup around Ukraine”. “I reiterated that further Russian aggression would be met with a resolute, massive, and united transatlantic response,” Blinken said. The US has said there was a high risk of a Russian attack on Ukraine before the end of Winter Olympics in China on 20 February, and the CIA was reported to have briefed allies that Russian troops have been ordered to be ready by Wednesday. Lavrov accused the US of ignoring its security proposals, which include a guarantee that Ukraine would not join Nato and a withdrawal of Nato forces from eastern Europe, and he denied there were any plans for an attack, saying US warnings were part of a propaganda campaign. “After Russian troops finish drills and return to barracks, the west will declare ‘diplomatic victory’ by having ‘secured’ Russian ‘de-escalation’,” the Russian foreign ministry quoted him as saying, describing it as a “predictable scenario and cheap domestic political points”. Both the US and Russia began rapid evacuations of their embassies. The US state department said a small number of diplomats would stay in Kyiv to keep channels of communication open with the Ukrainian government, some will pull back to Lviv in the west to provide emergency consular services, while most will be posted in neighbouring countries. “I think prudence requires us to assume to plan for, and prepare for, a worst-case scenario and the worst-case scenario would obviously involve substantial Russian attacks on the Ukrainian capital,” a senior state department official said. “These developments mean for private American citizens that it isn’t just time to leave Ukraine – it is past time for private citizens to leave Ukraine,” the official added, stressing that the consular staff were no longer in a position to help private citizens leave. Western intelligence agencies have predicted that a Russian attack would be immediately preceded by a fabricated pretext, such a “false-flag” attack on Russia or the Donetsk and Luhansk regions run by Moscow-backed separatists. Michael Kofman, the director of Russia Studies at the Center for Naval Analyses, said the Russia Duma was due to consider recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics on Monday. “14 February looks like it may offer a basis for Russia to extend security guarantees, and militarily protect those considered to be Russian citizens living in the separatist regions,” Kofman said on Twitter. “This may be interpreted as a clause which formally authorises the Russian state to use force in Ukraine.”",News/World news,Biden and Putin talk by phone amid rising Ukraine tension ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/12/biden-putin-ukraine-phone-call-us-russia
2/13/2022,"Five minutes before the half-time break, Scotland had the put-in to a scrum inside Welsh territory. After three phases Wales turned the ball over and began a charge upfield through the relentless Taine Basham. Liam Williams soon had it and exchanged several innocuous kicks with Stuart Hogg. Wales kept possession but coughed it up a minute later as it was Scotland’s turn to win the breakdown battle and regain control. Not that they did much with it. Several phases down the road and very little had changed. This brief segment encapsulated so much of the contest. Neither group was terrible. There were some exciting moments from men wearing red and blue alike. Wales’s forwards made massive strides from their defeat to Ireland last week, carrying with intensity and testing Scotland’s defence around the tighter channels.  They also surprised with their proficiency in the lineout, matching Scotland’s better-resourced set piece and mauling with technical efficiency. For their part, Scotland won the kicking battle and competed well on the ground. But there was little cohesion and very little in the way of sustained pressure or dominance outside of a small window following a yellow card to Finn Russell. This left Wales hammering at Scotland’s try line with a man advantage but Dan Biggar opted to end the sequence with a drop goal. This match was akin to watching 12 rounds of a flyweight boxing bout that contained very few hooks and only the occasional uppercut. They could have played in the Cardiff rain for a week before a blow of any real substance was landed. Wales won on points – both on the scoreboard and in this stretched boxing metaphor. Wayne Pivac won’t care about the length of the highlights reel, only that his team emerged from the scrap with four points. Scotland’s quest for a first win at the Principality since 2002 continues. Credit must go to the Wales back row. Basham, Ross Moriarty and the impressive Jac Morgan on debut are all smaller than their opposite numbers at the back of the Scottish pack. But they fought with palpable pride and an understanding that so many fans and journalists – including this one – had written their side off before the anthems were sung. They ran straight and hard and offered Tomos Williams and Biggar, a winner in his 100th Test, front-foot ball that they occasionally used to string creative moves out wide. When they did give the ball air they looked threatening in patches, though their inability to bust through Scotland’s line will need to be addressed in the coming weeks. It will stand Wales in good stead that their try was scored from a rumbling set-piece move. Much of the talk this past week focused on the lack of heft in the tight five. Their former captain Sam Warburton had expressed concern about Wales’s ability to hang with opponents that possessed more grunt up front. That is not to say that a corner has been turned. In fact, both Pivac and Gregor Townsend will have concerns about their respective packs’ inability to boss the gain line. Ireland and France await both teams and as much as the romantics love to see the ball flung about with abandon, cold logic dictates that championships are most often won by the team with the meanest baddies in the scrum. Without that forward dominance so much is left for the magicians in the backline and Scotland’s wizard at 10 barely cast a spell all day. Russell’s long pass set up Darcy Graham for his try in the opening quarter of an hour, but the fly-half was mostly quiet. His most telling contribution was a deliberate knock-on that kicked off a chain of events which eventually ended with Biggar’s winner. This match was not too dissimilar from Wales’ defeat here against South Africa in the autumn. Back then a close affair was turned by the Springboks’ power from the bench, which saw the world champions claim a tight victory. Townsend said on Thursday that he was ripping a page out of Rassie Erasmus’s playbook by unleashing two sets of front rows in order to keep his scrum motoring at full capacity through the 80 minutes. It is worth mentioning that the three-times world champions because, like them or not, they have laid down a blueprint on how to win these arm wrestles. Wales and Scotland have shown they can win big games. Wales are Six Nations champions by right and the Scots have an impressive list of recent scalps both home and away. But a year out from the World Cup, and in the midst of a competitive Six Nations, some questions persist around their title credentials. The most pertinent one concerns the raw strength in each team. Tougher examinations will be needed before a definitive answer is reached.",Sport/Sport,More questions than answers for both sides in Wales’s win over Scotland | Daniel Gallan,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/12/wales-scotland-six-nations-rugby-more-questions-than-answers
2/13/2022,"Francis Spufford, born in 1964, is an uncommonly gifted, adventurous and versatile writer. He began with nonfiction that included a powerful apologia for Christianity, Unapologetic, in 2012. He published Golden Hill in 2016 and it was golden: an outstanding debut, set in 18th-century New York, it won the Costa prize for a first novel. Light Perpetual, his second novel, was longlisted for the Booker prize and is a bold departure in fiction that imagines how it might have been if people who died when a German V2 rocket fell on south London had been able to live their lives. Tell me about the starting point for Light Perpetual.I’ve been walking to Goldsmiths [where he teaches writing] every Wednesday for the last 14 years and there’s a small, round memorial plaque on the branch of Iceland on the corner of the New Cross Road. There’s no reason to look at it, it’s part of the south London landscape. The plaque says 168 people were killed on that spot, one November lunchtime, in 1944, when a V2 fell on Woolworths and destroyed it. As well as beginning a fascination with that story, it began a train of thought about the extraordinary things cities ordinarily contain, then lose. I wanted to find a way of remembering the event that was faithful but not literal, so had to invent a London borough and drop a V2 of my own on to it, not to trample on anybody’s real grief.  To what extent, as a novelist, do you play God?The idea of a novelist being omnipotent is straightforwardly impossible. The best novelists can come up with, even at their most megalomaniac, is a cheap substitute. I wanted to come up with a viewpoint wrenched enough out of the human normal to keep us looking at our lives in time in a way we usually don’t do. You’re a prodigious reader – what were you like as a little boy?I was a solitary child, with a pudding-bowl haircut and a selection of acrylic polo necks, who got on more easily with adults – who enjoyed me being precocious and having the world’s largest vocabulary – than with children my own age. It wasn’t emotional precocity, it was verbal precocity – I had elaborate ways of saying simple things. I was frightened, almost permanently, of my younger sister’s serious illness, of which she would die in her early 20s, and it had the effect of keeping me turned away from feeling too much, too directly, about things in front of me. I lived in books for a long time. There was definitely some flight going on. I was a compulsive reader but it did not make me want to be a writer. I read for escape and did not want to do any of the hard work of providing that escape. I wanted to be a reader when I grew up and actually worked as a reader at Chatto & Windus [from 1987 to 1990], which was an education. Why and how?Carmen Callil [Chatto’s managing director] was a feminist icon but [Chatto] was also, weirdly, the last act of gentlemanly British publishing. It took place in a Georgian house, full of shabby, grand furniture. They had me in the attic reading and typing reports on an enormous manual typewriter. It’s a lost world now but felt like modernity at the time. You started writing in 1989, the year your sister died. Was that significant?I think that is too tidy. There must be some connection between an old sorrow reaching its end and becoming grief and being freer to start writing, but being ready to write also had its own independent timetable. It was about becoming less paralysed by perfectionism. It took me a long time to decide I wanted to be a writer. And then I felt that to call myself a writer, let alone a novelist, would be a kind of boast. I accepted it gradually, once I could see the objects I’d made. Your wife, Jessica Martin, a former Cambridge academic, is canon of Ely Cathedral. Are you still a lay representative of the diocese?I’m no longer a representative of the General Synod because I was really bad at it. Being a good talker as a writer does not translate into being any kind of successful church politician. Yet reading Unapologetic, I kept thinking: “Come on, Francis, you have to get into the pulpit.”No! I haven’t – I have the freedom of being a layperson, I don’t have to speak for an institution. I’ve preached the odd sermon by invitation and found it very nerve-racking. Performing something usefully devotional – it’s not my thing. And my wife is really, really good at it. How successful are you at practising what Light Perpetual almost preaches: living your life with mortality in mind?Mortality is easier to be on easy terms with when your death is further away. I have moments in the middle of the night when timor mortis takes me by the throat and I’m profoundly glad when morning comes. I’m not unafraid of death. I’m not reconciled to how temporary all this is. In Unapologetic, I was interested in what you say about guilt as a necessary emotion.As a culture, we’re unkind to ourselves by eliminating guilt because it forces us into an unstable oscillation between an impossibly perfect self-image and a dark, despairing self-image. It is as if we were constantly being taken by surprise by news of our own fallibility whereas we should accept we are hopelessly fallible, that our intentions are not always good. I am not that nice – and can live on easier terms with that. You have a 16-year-old daughter. How worried are you about the future of this planet?Deeply worried. I became a parent late – I’ve been a stepfather for longer. Not long after I became a father, I read Cormac McCarthy’s The Road – a horror-stained version of a universal parental emotion: the fear of having to leave your child somewhere unsafe. That, writ very, very large, is the situation of the planet in the 21st century. What books are on your bedside table?I’m going to count those on the floor as well… Virginia Woolf’s first novel, The Voyage Out, a strange experience because I didn’t know Mrs Dalloway turns up as a walk-on character in it. I’m rereading Thomas Pynchon’s Inherent Vice and there’s more… What’s the last great book you read?Sarah Hall’s Burntcoat was astonishing about pandemic times. It’s a short novel about a virus – not Covid – and an artist who hides with a man she does not know well. Which classic novel are you most ashamed not to have read?I’m ashamed only to have read one novel by Thomas Hardy: The Return of the Native… I understand he’s quite good. What book might people be surprised to see on your bookshelves?Daniel Abraham’s The Long Price Quartet – four fantasy novels from which I partly lifted the time structure for Light Perpetual. Which author do you always return to?Penelope Fitzgerald. Are you working on a new novel?I’m two-thirds of the way through a strange noir crime novel, set in 1922, in a different version of American history where there’s a city on the Mississippi largely populated by Native Americans. Gore, Jesuits and jazz – it will (probably) be called Cahokia Jazz and (probably) be out in 2023.  Light Perpetual by Francis Spufford is published by Faber (£8.99).

2/13/2022,"Passengers arriving in the UK on one of the first flights from Kyiv since the call for Britons to immediately leave Ukraine have described growing alarm in the country. The Foreign Office on Friday warned British nationals to leave Ukraine immediately while commercial flights are still available and the land border with Poland remains open. The number of British nationals in Ukraine is believed to be in the low thousands.  Haider Ali, a student at the Dnipro Medical Institute in central Ukraine, was among those arriving at Gatwick shortly after midday on Saturday. Ali, from Birmingham, told the PA news agency that he had been unsure about leaving the country. “I’d been in two minds about coming back because of the advice coming out by the British embassy, about the amber alert, red alert,” he said. “A lot of people, a lot of students were waiting for the red alert, and it happened yesterday. “Once that happened, everybody booked their tickets and left as soon as possible,” Ali said. He said his one-way flight ticket cost £210, adding that he thought prices would jump in coming days as people flee the country. The 21-year-old said his university, where around half of the students are British, had advised students to “get out as soon as you can”. The US on Friday warned of the “very distinct possibility” of a Russian invasion of Ukraine in the next few days and told all remaining Americans to leave the country in the next 48 hours. James Heappey, the UK armed forces minister, said that there are no plans for an emergency airlift by western air forces from Kyiv, unlike in Afghanistan last summer. “The Royal Air Force will not be in a position to go in and to fly people out,” he said on Saturday. Ali said public opinion in Ukraine remained divided over the likelihood of a Russian invasion, but that the view that the western media were exaggerating the severity of the crisis was changing. He said: “The Ukrainians are generally very laissez-faire as in terms of people, but the last couple of days they’ve started to get worried. “And when that happens, alarm bells should be ringing.” The divergent perspectives on the situation were exemplified in the views expressed by two passengers on the flight from the capital. Ukrainian Pasha Honcharuk, 24, from Kyiv, said he was “not too worried” and was just travelling for work. He said: “All news channels tell that there will be war but I don’t think so.” In contrast, a Ukrainian business analyst, who did not want to be named, said “of course everybody’s worried” about the possibility of an invasion. However, she said the threat had not been behind her decision to move to London for work. Amid calls for Britons to leave Ukraine immediately, the former British ambassador to the US Kim Darroch described the challenge remaining embassy staff would have to undertake to help Britons leave the country, saying it would “overwhelm the embassy’s resources”. “With lots of foreign nationals trying to get out, there will be chaos, there may need to be extra flights laid on so this will occupy everyone’s time for 24 hours a day for the next few days and you won’t get everyone out – some people will choose to stay,” Lord Darroch said.",News/World news,‘Everybody’s worried’: Britons urged to flee Ukraine arrive in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/12/britons-urged-to-flee-ukraine-arrive-in-uk
2/13/2022,"Returning to their birthplace after decades of enforced exile, five Chagossians leapt from a motor launch on to the palm-shaded beach of Peros Banhos atoll on Saturday afternoon, kissed the pale sand and stood – hands joined together – in thanksgiving prayers. For Olivier Bancoult, Lisbey Elyse, Marie Suzelle Baptiste, Rosemonde Bertin and Marcel Humbert, it was the moment they had long anticipated – the first time they could step ashore without close monitoring by British officials.  It is 50 years since they were deported to Mauritius by UK officials who cleared the archipelago of its entire population to make way for a US military base on the island of Diego Garcia. All five wore T-shirts emblazoned with the motto: ‘Chagos My Home’ and ‘Everyone has a right to live in his birthplace’. “We are not coming as tourists,” declared Bancoult, “we are coming as pilgrims to pay tribute to this abandoned place. “The importance of this trip is that we can send a message to the world – about the kind of injustice the UK government, with the help of the US government, inflicted on our people. If we were white people with blue eyes, maybe we would have had better treatment like the Falkland Islanders?” This the first visit organised by the Mauritian government, which is determined to regain control of the Chagos Archipelago. Successive international court rulings and a majority vote in the UN general assembly have confirmed that the UK ‘unlawfully’ detached the islands from Mauritius before independence and must return them. The UK insists its retains sovereignty and that the landmark ruling at the international court of justice in 2019 was only advisory. On Saturday, the Chagossians’ first task was to move a monument, recording a return visit under British supervision in 2006, further up the beach to avoid erosion from encroaching waves. In the sultry heat, they manoeuvred the heavy stone with sticks and sweated labour. The island’s jetty, which once received commercial ships, has disintegrated; its railway track, that carried goods to the island’s shop and transported copra oil, has rusted away. Even in this remote site, plastic water bottles littered the tideline and there was glass on the beach. A sign placed beside a concrete box declared: ‘This is a BIOT (British Indian Ocean Territory) fire pit. Outer Island 2018 regulations. Fires are only permitted in this area.’ While native Chagossians are denied permission to return permanently, BIOT officials grant licences for yachts to visit their deserted homes. Moving inland, trees have overgrown homes and warehouses fallen into decay since the island was forcibly evacuated in 1972. The ground is littered with rotting coconut shells, many sprouting fresh growth. Hermit crabs swarm across the ground and the occasional giant robber crab – capable of splitting coconuts in two with their claws – appeared in the undergrowth. What was, in the 1960s, the administrator’s bleached white house in a broad clearing is now derelict and overshadowed by palms. A giant banyan tree has taken root in the stone steps to the first floor, its roots gripping the stone. A vast water tank stands rusting beside the building. Nearby is the island’s chapel, Saint Sacrement. “This is where I was christened,” gestured Bancoult. The roof had collapsed, the walls were covered in yellow and ochre mould. With his fellow Chagossians, he set to work clearing the floor. Sprouting coconuts were hurled out through the empty windows. Marcel Humbert hacked at palm fronds with a machete, trying to push back the jungle from their former existence. “I was baptised here, too,” said Lisbey. “This is my church.” Bancoult added: “My grandfather had his funeral here in 1969. My mother made her first communion here. Can’t I have the right to live in my birthplace? It’s racism. They should give everyone in overseas territories the same treatment.” As the ship approached Peros Banhos on Friday evening, the prime minister of Mauritius, Pravind Jugnauth, told the Guardian in a telephone call that his country’s first expedition to the Chagos Island was “not in any way a hostile act” and not meant to embarrass the UK. “It is merely an exercise of our sovereignty over part of our territory and that is in accordance with international law.” In terms of the way the Chagossians had been treated, he added: “The UK has acted in violation of human rights and international law when it forcibly removed the Chagossians. Uprooting people from their place of birth and where they were living without any warning and putting them on a ship and just leaving them at the quay in Mauritius. And preventing them going back … That’s clearly a crime against humanity and it’s extraordinarily serious.” Responding to the criticism on Saturday, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in London said: “Successive UK governments have expressed sincere regret about the manner in which Chagossians were removed from BIOT in the late 1960s and early 1970s and we are currently delivering a £40m support package to Chagossians over a 10-year period.”",News/World news,Exiled Chagos Islanders return without UK officials for first time,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/12/exiled-chagos-islanders-return-without-uk-officials-for-first-time
