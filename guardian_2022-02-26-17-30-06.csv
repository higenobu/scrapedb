2/26/2022,"Bev Wong, a single parent from Brixton, south London, would never have taken her teenage daughters to visit a university like Oxford. It wasn’t just that she and other mums in her community didn’t believe elite universities wanted black state school kids. They also couldn’t afford the public transport to get there. But after being approached in her local church, Wong became part of Parent Power, a programme run by the prestigious King’s College London and the community organising charity Citizens UK. The aim of the project was to listen to what was deterring under-represented parents from encouraging their kids to go to selective universities, and then train groups of parents up to talk to others and campaign for a level playing field in education for their children. The first thing Wong’s group did was write to Oxford University. “People like me don’t have the networks or the money, but don’t think we don’t want the same things,” she says. “All the parents I speak to have big aspirations for their kids. They just don’t know who to go to to ask the questions.” After hearing from Wong’s parent group, Oxford University sent a coach to collect them for an open day. And so many local parents and teenagers signed up that some had to be turned away. After that the group contacted Cambridge, but this time they didn’t just ask for a coach, they said they also wanted to meet black students their teens could identify with, and to have some interactive activities. Wong says: “When we heard back from Oxford we were like, ‘Wow, just a letter from us did this!’ The second time we had a plan about what we needed.” For years, efforts to widen access to the top universities have focused solely on reaching out to disadvantaged kids at school. But the Brilliant Club, a charity working on social mobility, has decided real change won’t happen unless universities reach out to parents, too. The charity has set up Parent Power groups in Cardiff, Fenland and Knowsley and is planning more. Anne-Marie Canning, the charity’s new CEO, remembers her mother being the go-to person in the Asda supermarket where she worked for any colleagues who had questions about their kids going to university. Canning’s vision is to have a network of grass-roots working-class ambassadors like her mum across the country. Social mobility experts say this approach shouldn’t stop with universities and if ministers are serious about closing the attainment gap they need to get parents onboard at home. They argue parents are the missing link in the government’s impending schools white paper. This is expected to set a new goal of ensuring that 90% of children leave primary school have reached expected standards in reading, writing and maths by 2030. In 2019, the figure was 65%. Susie Whigham, the Brilliant Club’s acting CEO, says the government should be encouraging parents from poorer backgrounds to engage more. “There are things parents can do like reading to their child, which can have a significant impact if it becomes a daily routine. But it needs to be communicated in a way that recognises the pressures parents face.” Lee Elliot Major, professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, says: “I think the government has a real opportunity to grasp the nettle by encouraging schools to develop parental engagement plans. Otherwise I fear we will not see much change in the literacy and numeracy levels.” Elliot Major is leading a research project assessing the backgrounds of children born at the start of the millennium who ended up with less than a 4 (an old grade C) at English and maths GCSE. The researchers have found that three-quarters of children who were struggling in language tests at age three didn’t go on to achieve a pass (grade 4) in maths and English at 16. He says this means they will struggle to read a train timetable or understand a pay slip. He is calling for a public campaign about the importance of parents spending 20 minutes a day reading with their children. “Schools are not a sufficient force in addressing the country’s scandalously high illiteracy and innumeracy rates,” he says, adding that as a minimum it is “absolutely key” for parents to read to their children in the early years. Prof Becky Francis, the chief executive of the Education Endowment Foundation, a charity focusing on removing social inequality, says its research has shown getting parents involved can lead to four months’ progress over the course of a year for pupils. But the catch is there is no clear consensus on what actually works in pulling in parents. “We’ve tested several approaches but the constant message is it’s just really difficult,” she admits. On one engagement programme it piloted, attendance quickly tailed off among parents from lower-socio economic groups, while middle-class parents continued to turn up. She admits this is a problem: reaching out to parents risks giving the sharp-elbowed middle-classes further advantage and widening the attainment gap even further. She says: “These parents have often had a negative experience of school themselves and they find them intimidating places.” The head of an inner-city primary school, who asked not to be named, says: “Parents who live in poverty often didn’t have that support when they were children.” Her school is offering disadvantaged families an iPad loan after half-term so they can access online books purchased by the school. She says: “We will book in workshops again for parents, but the turnout for these is usually low. We’ve never cracked this.” She says some of her school’s parents can’t read English and may not be literate in their first language either, which makes encouraging them to read stories to their children much more challenging. Research by the National Literacy Trust has found that many children live in houses with no books, and one in 11 children in poorer households do not own even one book of their own. Liberty Venn, the founder of charity the Children’s Book Project, says poverty is increasingly a factor: “If you’ve got to choose between feeding your kids, buying new school shoes or paying for heating, of course you will swerve the book aisle in Tesco.” Venn’s charity aims to give out 250,000 nearly new books this year to children in the most deprived primary schools in the country. Chris Dyson, the head of Parklands school, one of the most deprived primary schools in Leeds, says persistence is key. A lot of his parents have “really bad” memories of their own time at school. When he took over he says he invited all the parents in to hear his plans and bought 80 doughnuts from Marks & Spencer as an enticement. Only a handful turned up. But he kept inviting them, and buying doughnuts, and before the pandemic he had up to 150 parents turning up for his weekly “all singing, all dancing” assembly. “It’s about perseverance,” he says. “And if you do things well, word gets around.” He has other ways to bring families in. The school runs a cooking club where kids and parents can cook together. It is so popular, he now opens the school for the club in the holidays. “They are taking home a chicken chasseur that will feed their family of five for a fiver and they think that’s brilliant,” he says. As a result, parents now sign up for workshops on how to help their child with reading or maths, and for training to improve their own lives, such as interview skills.",News/Education,"Improving literacy means a book – or an iPad – at bedtime, say researchers",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/26/improving-literacy-means-a-book-or-an-ipad-at-bedtime-say-researchers
2/26/2022,"Homes in the poorest areas of England have less than a third of the private garden space enjoyed by those in the richest, giving those residents a mental and physical health disadvantage that leads to worse outcomes from the cradle to the grave. According to a Guardian analysis, in the richest 10% of areas in England, properties had 379m sq on average, compared with 114m sq in the poorest 10%. The analysis, based on data from the Office for National Statistics, also found that areas with the highest proportion of addresses without any garden space at all were often in more deprived areas. In Somers Town, north London, among the 20% mostdeprived areas in the country, according to ONS figures, eight in 10 properties had no private outdoor space. In Ladywood-Summerhill, Birmingham, which is also among the poorest 20% of areas nationally, more than half of addresses had no garden. Those with the very lowest levels of private outdoor space were in city-centre locations. The neighbourhood with the least access to garden space in England was in central Birmingham, where just 2% of addresses had outdoor space. People from the poorest areas die on average 19 years younger than those from the wealthiest. While there are multiple factors of deprivation that contribute to that morbid inequality, campaigners warned that lack of access to nature affects people’s health and opportunities from childhood onward. Recent research has found that “living in areas with higher amounts of green spaces reduces mortality”, particularly from cardiovascular disease. And a study published in Environment International this week found that children living in areas with higher air pollution and very low levels of green space might have up to 62% increased risk of developing ADHD. Richard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “In combination with other inequality, lack of access to nature can exacerbate mental and physical health problems which harm quality of life and life expectancy. By contrast, even a short time in nature can lift our spirits and improve our health. So it’s the places without private gardens that need public investment in nature the most. “This important analysis from the Guardian could provide a blueprint for government, targeting action and investment to green the greyest areas on the map for the benefit of people and wildlife. We’re encouraging the public to petition for a new legal ‘right to nature’ to help galvanise action from the treasury to local authorities to ensure that no one is left without nature near home.” There are significant mental health benefits from access to green space. People who are more connected with nature are usually happier in life and more likely to report feeling their lives are worthwhile. And experiencing biodiversity, through bird species richness, plant species richness, habitat diversity and butterfly richness, is related to improved wellbeing, increased positive mood and lower levels of anxiety. A 2014 review of evidence found that people “who are more connected to nature tended to experience more positive affect, vitality, and life satisfaction compared with those less connected to nature”. Natural England has estimated that if everyone in England had good access to green space it could reduce NHS pressures enough to save £2.1bn in health spending every year. Across England, 12% of properties in the poorest areas had no garden space, compared with 8% in the richest. However, the lowest levels of garden access were found in the third-poorest group, where almost 15% lacked private outdoor space. Previous research by the ONS has found that people from ethnic minority groups living in England were less likely to have access to a private garden. Nearly four in 10 black people had no access to private or shared garden, a patio or a balcony, making them the worst affected ethnic group. Separate research by Friends of the Earth found that people from minority ethnic groups were more than twice as likely as white people to live in areas in England that were most deprived of green space. In 2019, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) established an environmental justice commission to address how the climate and nature crises intersected with economic and social injustice. Lesley Rankin, an IPPR researcher, said: “The pandemic has reminded us how important nature is for our health and wellbeing, but this research shows just how unequal access to quality green spaces is. “IPPR has spoken to people around the UK as part of our citizens juries on climate and fairness and they couldn’t have been clearer about how important nature is to them, that everyone should be able to access it, and that government should make nature a priority. Alongside public green spaces, they also found gardens a crucial place to engage with nature. “To address these stark inequalities, IPPR has called on the government to change planning rules so that all neighbourhoods benefit from nature, to put nature on the same footing as climate in national policy, and to invest £1bn a year in a National Nature Service.” The analysis used data on private green space and deprivation at middle-layer super output area (MSOA) level. The average MSOA contains about 8,000 people. All of the 10 local authorities with the lowest levels of garden space were in London, apart from Watford, which was in tenth place. Across the capital, just over a fifth of households had no garden space, the lowest proportion of any region. The highest levels of private outdoor space were found in the north-east, where 93% of properties had a garden. However, previous ONS analysis has found that “parks are most accessible in the poorest areas, with people in the most deprived neighbourhoods of England around twice as likely as those in the least deprived to be within five minutes’ walk of a public park.” While Somers Town residents have little garden space available, they have an average of 15 public green spaces within a kilometre radius, much higher than the national average. Methodology The analysis used ONS estimates for total garden space at MSOA level and deprivation estimates from the Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2019, published at MSOA level by mySociety. Areas were divided into deciles based on their deprivation score. Total garden space per MSOA was divided by the number of addresses to get garden space per capita. The analysis refers to England only as Scotland and Wales have their own indices of deprivation.",News/Inequality,Poorest areas of England have less than third of garden space enjoyed by richest,https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/feb/26/poorest-areas-of-england-have-less-than-third-of-garden-space-enjoyed-by-richest
2/26/2022,"Asingle man who has no great attachments in life is, by some complicated chain of circumstances, entrusted with the care of someone else’s child. Adventures ensue, and along the way both child and unlikely guardian do their own share of growing up. As an essential story premise, it’s been a Hollywood go-to for over a century, at least since Charlie Chaplin awkwardly took on a foundling infant in silent classic The Kid. It’s a trope that often lends itself to gloopy sentimentality and pat buddy comedy – but writer-director Mike Mills avoids both those pitfalls in his altogether lovely film C’mon C’mon, now out for home viewing after getting rather too little attention in cinemas. It’s a film both comforting and bracing, warming viewers with the feelings of tender uplift that we usually get from stories of people learning to care for each other – before surprising us with uneasy, nuanced questions about 21st-century parenthood and the future we’re leaving our children. Coming right off Joker, Joaquin Phoenix is pretty ideally cast as the guy who wouldn’t be your first (or fifth) choice of emergency guardian for your child, and it’s a treat to see him exercising the sweeter, softer side of his screen persona. He plays travelling radio journalist Johnny, adrift after a recent breakup and estranged from his sister Viv (a wonderful Gaby Hoffmann), who is overwhelmed by the pressures of motherhood to wayward nine-year-old Jesse (Woody Norman) even before a family crisis forces her to leave the boy in her brother’s uncertain hands. Initially wary of each other, uncle and nephew come to recognise their shared eccentricities and anxieties, and grow quietly, profoundly close that way. The great joy of Mills’s writing is that he treats adults and children as intellectual and psychological equals, complex and confused in equal measure. And in Norman he has unlocked a remarkably perceptive, witty young actor; the young British star’s Bafta nomination is well deserved, though the film as a whole has been under-rewarded. No matter. Paper Moon (Apple TV), one of the films Mills has cited as an inspiration, also got less than its due back in 1973 and is a firmly entrenched classic now. The sharp, snappy comic chemistry between Ryan O’Neal and his real-life daughter Tatum – as thrust-together cons who are clearly two peas in a pod, however much he denies paternity – still crackles, powering the late Peter Bogdanovich’s road movie along a perfectly balanced line between cuteness and vinegary cynicism. Tonally, Mills’s film perhaps owes more to Wim Wenders’s spare, breezily melancholic Alice in the Cities (1974; BFI Player), which also takes interest in the shared damage of a shambling guardian and his ward, and how they care for each other. Chaplin’s aforementioned The Kid (Curzon) essentially perfected the genre straight away: as the Little Tramp’s initially amusing childcare exploits give way to full-waterworks custody melodrama, its cry-laugh-cry-again manipulations still work like gangbusters 101 years later. If you’re mostly after films that make you go “awwww”, meanwhile, Czech film-maker Jan Svěrák’s 1996 crowdpleaser Kolya – in which a middle-aged Prague wastrel is lumped with a five-year-old Russian poppet, prompting bonding across linguistic barriers – still absolutely does the job. It won an Oscar in its day, and easy as it is to be cynical about its heartstring-tugging, you can see why. And if you want slightly spikier comedy, Taika Waititi’s rollicking wilderness romp Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016; Amazon Prime), about an orphaned teen and his foster father surviving a manhunt, raises the usual stakes a little. Finally, men don’t have a monopoly on unsuitable babysitting in the movies. You can only find Tilda Swinton’s tour de force in Julia (2008) – playing an alcoholic kidnapper turned rescuer – on DVD, though it’s worth the hunt. But you can stream Gena Rowlands’s ferocious star turn in John Cassavetes’s Gloria (1980; Google Play), as a gangster’s moll on the run with a boy targeted by the mob, and it’s a thrill: as heart-in-mouth urgent as C’mon C’mon is gently contemplative, and no less wise for it. Glasgow Film at HomeOnce again, the Glasgow film festival, which runs from 2-13 March, is offering a selection of highlights from this year’s programme on their streaming platform. Among the titles worth seeking out: Yuni, a striking Indonesian coming-of-age tale of a teen facing an arranged marriage, which won top prize at Toronto last year; Hive, a hopeful, Sundance-laurelled Kosovan study of female entrepreneurship; and True Things, a taut, erotic psychodrama with a sensational Ruth Wilson performance. Cicada(Amazon/Apple TV)New York film-maker Matthew Fifer directs, writes, produces, edits and stars in this autobiographical, woozily atmospheric labour-of-love indie about two Brooklyn men hesitantly falling in love and overcoming past trauma. It’s small and shaggy, but shot through with interesting, intersectional ideas about class, race, privilege and queerness that keep it from navel-gazing. Becoming Cousteau(Dogwoof)That Liz Garbus’s Bafta-nominated documentary about history’s most famous oceanographer is co-produced by two of his children doesn’t bode well, but this intelligently assembled portrait generally avoids hagiography, inserting some critical perspective amid its more transporting moments.

2/26/2022,"As Manchester City had not been in great form during 2021/22 and leaving them 12 points behind Women’s Super League leaders Arsenal, Forest, who went into the game on the back of a five game unbeaten run, would have been hopeful of an upset. However, despite the magic and romance of the FA Cup, with two divisions separating the visiting WSL side and hosts Forest, who play in the Women’s National League Northern Premier, it really was a case of David v Goliath with Manchester City, despite having a number of star names missing, proving too strong for their lower league opponents. It was the second time this season that Nottingham Forest had played at the City Ground with 3994 rocking up for the fourth round cup tie. Derby University Sports journalism student Chloe Reynolds, who attended the game, said: “I like to go to as many matches as possible, including my own team Everton.” At the final whistle Reynolds might have wished she had put a bet on as when asked what she thought the score would be, she said: “8-0 to Man City.” Fans Daniel Raven and Joshua Malpass kept warm in the stands despite only wearing their Forest shirts and scarves for protection against the cold. The visiting fans had something to celebrate just two minutes in when Caroline Weir opened the scoring, firing home a left-footed shot from just outside the six-yard box. Despite dominating the game, the City fans had to wait until the 34th minute for a second goal which came when Khadija Shaw headed home a Filippa Angeldahl corner. The visitors went into half time three goals to the good after Angeldahl beat the offside trap to latch onto Alex Greenwood‘s floated pass before poking into the bottom corner. Lucy Bronze was one of the Manchester City’s stars that graced the City Ground Manchester City’s Lauren Hemp surges forward as the visitors dominate the game with over 80% possession and consequently it was a busy day for Nottingham Forest’s keeper Emily Batty. Georgia Stanway equalled and then broke Nikita Parris’ record of 62 goals to become the highest scoring women’s player in the club’s history. Stanway’s first goal was also the club’s 600th goal as a professional side in all competitions. She ensured that she took the match ball home by cutting inside and unleashing a rocket during stoppage time to bag herself a hat-trick. Khadija Shaw netted twice, increasing her tally for the campaign to 11 goals in 16 games, her first came in the first half and she capped a fine display by notching her second in the 69th minute by capitalising on a goalkeeper error and smashing home. The other City goalscorer was Hemp who netted their fifth early in the second half, going on a typically mazy run before finishing well into the far corner. Academy players Jemima Dahou and Ginny Lackey were handed their first-team debuts, coming on in the 75th minute. City manager Gareth Taylor said: “I thought they did really well and it was really difficult because they only trained one day with us. They had to travel down separately to us because of Covid rules so it’s not been easy for them, but I am sure they have absolutely loved the day. I had a quick chat with them and they were delighted.” The final whistle brings respite for the Forest players and celebrations for the City players. It was a success return to the City Ground for Gareth Taylor, who played for Forest from 2003 to 2006. The match also saw City’s keeper Ellie Roebuck return between the sticks for her first action of the 2021/22 campaign after being out for four months with a calf injury. Time for signing autographs and taking selfies with the fans, and celebrating with family and friends. Their victory landed City a visit to neighbours Manchester United in the fifth round on Sunday where they’ll be hoping for a result similar to that during their WSL meeting earlier this month.",Sport/Football,"Women’s FA Cup photo essay – road to Wembley, fourth round: Nottingham Forest v Manchester City",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/26/womens-fa-cup-photo-essay-road-to-wembley-fourth-round-nottingham-forest-v-manchester-city
2/26/2022,"It may be a stretch to say Phil Mickelson profited from the demise of Tiger Woods. Nonetheless, when Woods became embroiled in a 2009 infidelity scandal Mickelson, soon to win a third Masters, became the poster boy of the American golfing public. Mickelson’s play was swashbuckling and successful, his image clean enough to eat one’s dinner from. As Tiger lay embarrassed, grinning Phil captured hearts and minds. It seems poetic, then, that Mickelson has suddenly fallen victim to golf’s biggest reputational trashing since Woods hit the front page of the National Enquirer. And this, at a time when Woods’s latest comeback from serious injury continues against a backdrop of huge external support. The trouble with going to great lengths to portray yourself as purer than the driven snow is that when a counter-narrative appears, sceptics will not be slow to shout about it. A week ago, Mickelson was closely linked to a Saudi Arabian-backed Super Golf League fronted by Greg Norman. Mickelson had accused the PGA Tour of “obnoxious greed” over matters which nobody in the wider world had particular reason to care about. Mickelson’s position in the pantheon of greats was unharmed. Now? In a world not at all renowned for caustic criticism, Rory McIlroy has branded Mickelson “naive, egotistical, selfish, ignorant”. Mickelson has lost sponsorship. The prospects of him captaining the US Ryder Cup team or forging a future career in the television booth are, at best, remote. For an individual who placed such stock in a careful public-relations policy, his has been a remarkable implosion. Whisper it, but Brand Phil was never particularly convincing. Mickelson has produced extraordinary moments in his career but nothing to match the simultaneous scorching of the Saudis and the PGA Tour. “They are scary motherfuckers to get involved with,” Mickelson said of Saudi Arabia. “We know they killed [Jamal] Khashoggi and have a horrible record on human rights. They execute people over there for being gay. Knowing all of this, why would I even consider it? Because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates. They’ve been able to get by with manipulative, coercive, strong-arm tactics because we, the players, had no recourse.” So Mickelson knew precisely about the issues that afflict any relationship with Saudi Arabia but, in the name of commercial leverage, proceeded anyway. He delivered a half-hearted apology, saying his “off the record” speech had been taken “out of context”. Alas, “scary motherfuckers” would not seem to require broader detail. For a man of Mickelson’s experience and intelligence – he is far from stupid – to miscalculate the impact of these words being delivered to a biographer defies belief. Norman’s scheme no longer makes fiscal sense, if it ever did, such is the level of opposition by players at the summit of golf. Mickelson still found time to laud the “visionaries” behind it, as if the entire idea is not integral to rebranding Saudi’s dismal global reputation via golfers who have little by way of conscience. Xander Schauffele, the world No 7, cuttingly said the SGL “isn’t close to a finished product or a business model”. And after years of trying. There has been speculation the PGA Tour may suspend Mickelson. Such a move would be futile. Damage already done to this individual and the SGL is such that sanction would serve no purpose. Mickelson, once the darling of the galleries, will suffer when subjected to ridicule on his return to the fairways. And he is almost guaranteed to struggle; last year’s US PGA Championship win sits as the clear exception to a dismal run of results. Mickelson may re-emerge from cold storage at the Masters – spectators would be used to prop up a Georgia overpass should they abuse a past champion – but is a near certainty to miss the PGA Tour’s marquee event, the Players Championship, in mid-March. Mickelson has earned $95m from PGA Tour competition, meaning he is second only to Woods. The Tour’s pension fund is famously generous. He has enjoyed huge endorsement contracts. Quite why, at 51, Mickelson wants or needs to pursue dubious desert riches should be a source of general bemusement. If his absolute goal was to run or control the Tour, a simple pitch saying as much – which would inevitably have garnered support, such is his profile – would have been far more worthwhile than trying to play rope-a-dope with the Public Investment Fund. While Mickelson’s fall reverberates across sport, there is also cause to contemplate what the Saudis will do next. The notion that the kingdom will abandon the disruption plan is contradicted by, for example, the protracted but ultimately successful pursuit of Newcastle United. Norman’s open letter to the PGA Tour, published on Thursday, warned: “This is just the beginning.” The Australian has a salary that dictates such bullishness is necessary. Yet there also exists a clutch of golfers, many of whom are in the latter stages of their mainstream careers, who will still be tempted by Saudi riches. Theirs would be a dumbed down environment but when dollar signs prevail above all else in the thought process, this may not matter. The silence from that group, among them Ryder Cup icons, is deafening. At Newcastle, the Saudis were not attempting to overthrow an existing sporting ecosystem. They are not, either, in women’s golf. Involvement with the Ladies European Tour has seen the lucrative Aramco Series develop without much fuss at all. Industry insiders now believe Norman could turn his attention towards the making of further inroads on that tour, which has a captive audience due to stark economics. Not that a smooth road would be guaranteed; Martin Slumbers, the chief executive of the R&A, and his counterpart at the DP World Tour, Keith Pelley, sit on the LET board. Alliances exist between the LET and the US-based LPGA Tour, just as they do between the LPGA Tour and the PGA Tour. Norman has chosen to focus on claims that no player can combine the super league with the PGA Tour. The former world No 1 believes this is a policy that cannot stand. It is a topic worthy of minor intrigue, and could in theory result in courtroom battles, but Mickelson’s tumble dominates his sport’s discourse. Woods knows the movie all-too well.",Sport/Sport,Phil Mickelson’s spectacular fall and golf’s infighting over Saudi riches | Ewan Murray,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/26/phil-mickelsons-spectacular-fall-and-golfs-infighting-over-saudi-riches
2/26/2022,"Political talent is in short supply. So is a willingness to step up and take the burdens and the blows of office. The leader of Newcastle city council, Nick Forbes, has been toppled as a result of destructive tribal shenanigans, likely to deter others from giving up most of their life to become councillors. All political careers end in failure, goes the old dictum, and it’s usually so. But Forbes’s career has been no failure. As leader of the council for 11 years, he steered his city through the lost decade’s savage cuts, protecting vulnerable people where he could and upholding Newcastle’s pride with ingenuity and political imagination. One of a generation of outstanding Labour council leaders, he was deselected from his seat in Arthur’s Hill ward, which he represented for 22 years, after an ambush this month. His deselection is reported to have been the result of a clash with the former Labour chief whip, local MP Nick Brown. Rules may have been breached in the process, and the party will investigate, ChronicleLive reports. But Forbes prefers to walk away with his dignity intact, he tells me, not fight over rulebooks. What’s more, his tenure in office shouldn’t be defined by the petty factionalism that ended it, but by the hard task of preserving his city in an age of austerity, against vicious odds. Does his downfall show he was a failure? Financially, some might say: at 48, he received total pay of £27,600 a year, with no pension, for the past 11 years for heavy responsibilities. But he walks away reflecting on how he navigated killer cuts of 40% of Westminster funding. Labour leaders are trapped by the Tories’ gleeful ploy to “devolve the axe”, forcing local authorities to make agonising choices with shrunken budgets, taking the full blast of local blame. Right from 2010, Labour cities – the poorest places – took the hardest hit, Tory shires the least. Now with “levelling up”, funds again are diverted to Tory towns – often not the poorest – rather than the most deprived cities. What should they do? Protest, certainly. But they still have to carry out the cuts, find clever ways to raise funds and try to protect the weakest. “That’s our tightrope,” Forbes tells me, “to highlight the hardship of cuts without damaging the city’s reputation.” At election time, despite the blows, they still have to proclaim achievements – and Newcastle still dazzles its visitors. Survival meant dealing with the enemy: he struck an early “city deal” with central government, he tells me, allowing Newcastle to keep business rates fixed for 25 years and to borrow to build. He also claims that they have built more council housing in the last 10 years than in the previous 30. “Aggressively pursuing” vacant owners, hundreds of empty properties have been brought back into use. Defending families against the monstrous bedroom tax, they built homes with a “hobby room” rather than a spare bedroom. With the 2011 abolition of the education maintenance allowance, which supported poor children staying on in sixth forms, they found £15 a week for the neediest. Newcastle council had a living wage long before the rest of the UK. Partnerships with the private sector have been key: that includes a “good work pledge”, where hundreds of employers agree union representation, pensions and no zero-hours contracts. “The government dismantled the welfare state, so we had to create our own.” Of course, it was slender protection against tidal waves of poverty from the £37bn national benefit cuts, money that was taken from pockets of the poor and from the city’s economy. When a large number of England’s 3,500 Sure Starts were lost, Newcastle kept them for 30% of the poorest. Only when Forbes cut the arts did national celebs protest, not about lost nurseries and youth clubs. Newcastle is a “city of sanctuary” for asylum seekers and unaccompanied refugee children, despite far-right marches and demos outside mosques. Its Labour councillors were mainly male and white, now half are women, with more ethnic minority members, including the UK’s first Roma councillor. As an LGBTQ+ leader, Forbes has taken shedloads of homophobic abuse. He grumbles that London-based journalists rock up in Newcastle, hear his list of the city’s thriving inward investments and jobs created – but then go home to write only about grinding poverty, featuring “grim up north” scenes from Byker and Benwell. I plead partly guilty, because there’s no escaping the brutal effects of Westminster-induced hardship, though I reported on the Forbes administration’s enterprise and inventiveness too. His detractors accused him of spending too long out of his ward – but those against “moderates” resented his place attending “moderate” Keir Starmer’s shadow cabinet. Each shadow minister now has a local Labour leader as part of their team, at last drawing on Labour’s formidable local strengths.

2/26/2022,"Olivia Colman and Josh O’Connor were last on screen together as the Queen and Prince Charles, but since then the stars of The Crown are among an array of A-listers who spent part of pandemic in Ireland where film and TV production has hit record levels. Figures released by Screen Ireland show that industry investment surged 40% in 2021, beating the previous record levels of 2019 despite Covid restrictions. Some put it down to overspill from the UK where the industry is so busy it faces an acute skills shortage. Others, including Tristan Orpen Lynch, the producer of two new movies starring Colman and O’Connor, say it is the coming of age of the Irish film industry. “It is amazing. There is a sort of magnetic creative energy in Ireland for film and TV right now, but it is not an overnight success. It has taken a couple of decades of really tough work and government support that got the industry to this place,” said Orpen Lynch. He recalls 25 years ago when Ireland would attract “one really big film a year” and everyone in the industry would be working on it. Ireland is now host to dozens of international feature films in production or post-production and a multitude of TV series, including a TV adaptation of Graham Norton’s Holding, Joyriden (a comedy drama set in Kerry starring Colman), and Aisha, starring O’Connor and Letitia Wright, charting the experience of a young Nigerian woman caught in the Irish immigration system. “Letitia is an extraordinary talent, and Josh O’Connor, both of them are going to blow your mind with their performances, which are literally off the scale,” said Orpen Lynch. Part of the boom is being put down to the insatiable global demand for content fuelled by streaming platforms including Netflix, Amazon, Disney Plus and Apple. “It’s been so full-on, it’s like a whirlwind,” said Orpen Lynch, whose company Subotica is also co-producing the six-part thriller North Sea Connection, set in Connemara on the Atlantic coast, for the Swedish platform Viaplayt. Screen Ireland, which supported the Subotica productions, is to open five film academies, including one specialising in animation, to keep up with the demand for talent. “Over the last decade the Irish screen industries have doubled in size,” said Désirée Finnegan, its chief executive, crediting in part government support that is allowing Ireland to compete regularly with UK studios such as Pinewood. Its largest facility, the 14-hectare (36-acre) Troy Studios in Limerick, was home to Ireland’s largest production, the Apple series Foundation, was last year sold along with Ardmore Studios in Wicklow, the heart of the production business for the past 60 years previously part-owned by U2 manager Paul McGuinness, to an American joint-venture. The boom in production in such a short time has also meant sound and visual effects companies have had to change their business model. “We’ve gone from a situation where we have to try and grab whatever sails past our door to thinking strategically about what’s happening internationally,” said John Kennedy, the creative director at Windmill Lane audio and visual post-production house. “We don’t think twice now about bringing in talent from all over the world working remotely,” he said. Kennedy describes how he was speaking to a Netflix executive last week who had “200 shows in front of them”, which they will “dice and slice” placing elements of the production “all around the world” . “Ireland is capitalising on that. We have gone from a stop-start industry busy for six months and not the next, to turning away work,” he said. Some, though, sound a note of caution about the explosion in the industry. Ed Guiney, whose company, Element Pictures, was behind the hit TV adaptation of Sally Rooney’s bestselling novel Normal People, said his concern was development of a strong indigenous international-facing sector. “You have to ask who controls this? Much of what is happening in Ireland I would call offshore production, it is other entities coming in to use the facilities. The real prize is when we have come of age and are making our own shows internationally. I think there’s a lot of hype going on, I’d like to see the quantum leap like you see in the UK,” he said. He produced The Favourite, for which Colman’s performance as Queen Anne won an Oscar, and has four films in production including a new film for the BBC starring Mark Ruffalo and Willem Dafoe shooting in Budapest and three TV shows in the pipeline, including production of Rooney’s first novel, Conversation with Friends. “A lot of what we make in Ireland is what other people are developing it is a service industry. That’s my beef with all the hype around the boom. It is very exciting but to have a full production industry we need more investment in Irish talent,” he said.",Arts/Film,Ireland’s film industry booms on back on record investment,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/26/irelands-film-industry-booming-thanks-to-record-investments
2/26/2022,"Iwas on a photoshoot earlier this month and while we were discussing possible lacquers, the on-set manicurist said she was tempted to carry only a bottle of Chanel’s Rouge Noir to work, since it would save her poor back from lugging around an entire spectrum of nail shades, when almost invariably every client she works with just plumps for the classic blackish, blood red shade anyway. It’s not hard to see why. Rouge Noir (known as Vamp in the US, £18) was first seen in 1994, on Uma Thurman’s Mia Wallace in Pulp Fiction and has been a global bestseller ever since. With enough black to be neutral and cool, but with sufficient red as not to be too avant garde or gothic, it works with just about every outfit, on every nail length and age, and for every occasion, casual or smart. Its newer formula has much better staying power than the original, though notably it has never been duped exactly in a long-lasting salon gel formulation (CND’s Fedora is beautiful but too brown; Port Wine from Biosculpture comes closer, but is a dot too red). This prompted me to wonder why specific nail lacquers are so enduring in their appeal? After Rouge Noir, my mind turns immediately to Essie Ballet Slippers (£5.99), a semi-sheer nude, milky, Park Avenue princess-style pink worn by everyone from Barbra Streisand to Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (including, it would appear, on her wedding day). Clean, gentle and unobtrusive, it is the Grace Kelly to Rouge Noir’s Sophia Loren, but somehow remains modern-looking, especially now, when French manicures are back in vogue. No nail wardrobe would be complete without OPI’s legendary I’m Not Really a Waitress ( £13.90), a rich, metallic, dark red paint the shade of a teenager’s fantasy sports car. It is so classic, so instantly glam, that it’s easy to assume this needs sharp talons to set it off, but in fact, it looks equally wonderful on a short mani. There is nowhere I’m Not Really a Waitress can’t respectably go and, like Ballet Slippers, its availability in regular and gel formulations means you need never miss out on it. Finally, special mention must go to Dior’s Nail Glow (£21), a polish that’s pretending to be nothing of the sort. This cult classic, clear raspberry glaze is a no-brainer to apply, and leaves nails shiny, healthy-looking and with just enough polish to feel posh.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Varnishing act: the only nail polishes I’ll ever need | Sali Hughes,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/26/only-nail-polishes-ill-ever-need-sali-hughes
2/26/2022,"‘I’ve been told,” says Daisy Edgar-Jones, “that the trick for posing at film premieres is to put one foot forward, lift your chin, and basically try to emanate with your face that you’re a top-class lawyer who’s won a big case.” We’re standing together in a London park, not far from where the 23-year-old actor grew up, on a cold but sunlit morning in February. Soon, Edgar-Jones will fly to Los Angeles for the premiere of a gory and provocative new thriller she has made called Fresh. Although her career exploded in spring 2020, when she starred with Paul Mescal in the TV adaptation of Sally Rooney’s Normal People, the years since then have been Covid-straitened and quite weird (“smudged” is how Edgar-Jones puts it), and she has not yet had any red carpet practice. This will be her first premiere. Have a practise now, I suggest? “Here?” She glances over her shoulder. We’re by a boating pond, on the gloopy waters of which there are chained-up pedalos in the shapes of unicorns and swans; a disconsolate sight, we agree. A few dog-walkers are making circuits of the park, but nobody’s watching. “All right,” she says, and she puts one white-trainered foot in front of the other. She lifts her chin. She adopts a fierce, lawyerly scowl … We were supposed to be meeting for a coffee in the park’s cafe, only it’s out of season and the doors are firmly shut. Edgar-Jones, who knows the local terrain well, ponders our options. Brisk walk, to keep off the cold? Brave it out on a bench? Climb aboard an anchored pedalo? On closer inspection, she notes, all of the pedalos are covered with bird droppings. Walk it is! She wraps herself tighter inside a camel-coloured coat and leads the way. We zigzag around the muddy paths of the park, completing a few circuits, eventually passing within sight of her family home. She waves an arm: “Over there.” When Normal People appeared on BBC iPlayer, becoming a sensation in the middle of that strange and scary first lockdown, Edgar-Jones was living in a London flatshare. As soon as the world opened up, she went off to work, capitalising on elevated acting stock to make Fresh (filmed in Canada) then an adaptation of the bestselling novel Where the Crawdads Sing (shot in Louisiana), then a mini-series called Under the Banner of Heaven (Canada again). She spent a year abroad, much of it masked, on Covid-wary sets, living in solitary rentals. She has just got back to London and has been staying with her parents, rehumanising with Sunday roasts and free lifts. Has she come back with a bump, I ask? Or a sigh of relief? A bit of both, Edgar-Jones says. “As much as I loved and am grateful for a year of consistent work, there were times when I was lonely. Really missed my friends. I just haven’t seen them. I was away for something like 10 and a half months out of the 12. And that little bit of time I was home, I was jet-lagged. Bad company.” Happily for me, she is good company today, a rapid talker and rapid walker, one of those people who prefers to look at you as they speak and so pounds along without seeing where they’re going. Of the astonishing success of Normal People, she says: “I think I’m still processing it, to be honest. I haven’t worked out what it all means – if it means anything at all.” But enough time has passed that she will get stabs of nostalgia, she says, whenever she thinks about it. She still swaps texts with the friends she made on set, including Mescal. “But I haven’t seen anyone I made it with for two years now.” I suggest it must feel a bit like having made very close friends on holiday before everyone disperses to their separate homes. “That’s right, a holiday feeling. Filming was so intense. So full-on and all-consuming. Only you and that specific group of people know what it was like. A very insular experience that I now have this massive nostalgia for.” Like Mescal, Edgar-Jones has been following the news from a distance while the creative team from Normal People adapt another Sally Rooney novel, Conversations With Friends. On the day I meet Edgar-Jones, a trailer for that series has just been released online: “It looks so-o-o beautiful,” she says. She was in Calgary last autumn when Rooney’s third novel, Beautiful World, Where Are You, came out. “I cycled to a bookshop that first day. I sat in a park in the sun and read it in one go.” Edgar-Jones had got to know Rooney well enough, during pre-production meetings for Normal People, to pop her a quick email of congratulations after she read the new book. “And can you imagine how well she writes an email in reply? I wanted to frame it.” As she read that day, Edgar-Jones says, she couldn’t help but imagine how she would perform one or other of Rooney’s new characters. “I think as soon as you’ve seen the man-behind-the-curtain, you can’t go back,” is how Edgar-Jones explains this impulse. “You want to read the new novel and lose yourself. But it’s hard to disconnect. Your work brain is picturing 20 people behind a camera, and a boom mic hovering over them. You find yourself wondering whether it would make a better film or miniseries … ” Actually, the main result of her reading that day, she says, was to make her communicate more richly with her friends from home. Beautiful World, Where Are You is centred on a series of long, confessional emails between two friends in their late 20s and, while she read, Edgar-Jones suddenly realised that her own conversations with friends had reduced to a series of hellos, I-miss-yous, be-good-to-catch-ups, over text. So she went back to her rental and wrote a long email to her best friend back home, expressing what I imagine a lot of young people have felt over two stunted, isolation-heavy years: that important aspects of their youth have been spirited away from them. Edgar-Jones summarises what she wrote: “I’m here in my apartment. I’ve just watched another season of Below Deck. I’ve had another meal of order-in food. I bought a candle and I felt … joy? But is this enough? Should I be living it up more? Is this how our 20s are supposed to be?” Distraction comes in the form of a wooden hut. A man is selling hot drinks from a hatch. Appalled by my order – I ask for something frothy with half the advertised amount of caffeine – Edgar-Jones leans in to confer with the man, agreeing that her own cup will contain the usual amount of coffee, maximum coffee, all the coffee. She turns to me and says: “Sorry. But.” Edgar-Jones’s mother, Wendy, grew up in Northern Ireland. Her father, Philip, a media executive who runs entertainment at Sky TV and the Sky Arts channel, is Scottish. Her family are based in the same part of London that I grew up in, right where the northern suburbs begin. I thought I knew the accents of this part of the city as well as anyone, but Edgar-Jones’s way of speaking confounds me. There are Irish vowel sounds, Scottish vowel sounds. If she wants to, she can sprinkle her conversation with enough variations of the word mate (“Mate! … Maaaaaate … Mate?”) to pass muster as a Londoner, but at the same time she says “wee” not “little”, “gosh” more often than “God”, “ach!” instead of “oh!”. While we wait for our coffee, she tries to explain this patchwork accent. She is an only child and her parents, two of her closest friends, have always had a strong influence on her. “My grandad moved in with us when I was about 11 as well. He died when I was 16. He had a very strong Northern Irish accent. Another big influence.” She has started to wonder, as well, if it’s a defensive thing. “I’ve played a lot of characters with accents, and I feel like I’ve sort of kept bits of them in my subconscious. Whenever I get shy, whenever I find it hard to speak as myself, little pieces of these accents sort of creep out.” Coffees in hand, we carry on with our walk, talking over the beginnings of Edgar-Jones’s career. Her first acclaim came aged about seven, when she won a local ice-dancing competition. “I was dressed as Macavity from Cats. I did a sort of cartwheel on the ice. I think that’s what swung it.” She was educated at a private school and a state sixth-form college where she got decent grades at A-level. She decided not to go to university in order to have a stab at acting. After some earlier training with the National Youth Theatre, she signed with an agent while still a schoolgirl, working on ITV’s reboot of Cold Feet at 17. Before Normal People, she made an independent film, Pond Life, and filmed two series of a UK/French co-production of War of the Worlds. By the spring of 2019, when she turned 21, work was going … all right? Regular auditions. Intermittent yesses, lots of nos. There was one big part that Edgar-Jones was up for, which she came very close to landing, but missed. She won’t say what, but rejection stung as badly as being dumped, and she immediately went away in a funk and got the actors’ equivalent of a break-up haircut. It was only a new fringe, but what a bizarrely consequential new fringe. To this day she is convinced that this angry new haircut helped her land the part as Marianne, the high-minded nonconformist of Normal People. Her knack for switching between accents must have helped, too. Edgar-Jones was one of the last actors to be cast in Normal People, and an unusual choice in that she was not based in Ireland. After a series of solo auditions, she secured the gig after a “chemistry read” with Mescal, already cast as the other lead, Connell. Normal People became a defining show of an era, in part because of its cool, even-handed script by Rooney and Alice Birch, in part because of directors Hettie Macdonald and Lenny Abrahamson’s unhurried pacing and technical dazzle. But this particular story (“First love, first heartbreak, stripped down to just that, in all its rawness,” as Edgar-Jones summarises it) was always going to live or die on the co-stars’ chemistry. How bad were the nerves, that first week of filming, I ask? Edgar-Jones blinks and says she was like the duck in that oft-used analogy: “Above the water you have to appear absolutely chilled. But underneath your legs are flapping like billyo.” They shot from May to October 2019, in Dublin and Sligo mostly, but also in Italy and Sweden. “Real highs,” Edgar-Jones recalls, “some lows. I was very green as an actor. There were definitely times I thought, my God, I don’t know what I’m doing, I’m too wee. There was this thought that if I had one bad day at work I’d have to live with the results for the rest of my life.” She grew in confidence, helped on by the close friendships she was forming on set. “It was like a cosy romance, just with lots and lots of people. We almost forgot we were making something that was going to be seen.” When she returned in autumn 2019 to her London flatshare, her friends put up a handmade sign, welcoming her home. She had lined up a part in a revival at the Almeida theatre of Mike Bartlett and Rupert Goold’s play, Albion. She spent the winter in rehearsal before opening night in February 2020. Her main fear was that the audience wouldn’t laugh in response to her occasional jokes. “Hard to come back from that silence, or, even worse, that polite little ‘Hrm-hrm’ that people do out of their noses when they don’t find a joke funny.” But by the end of the run she was listening out for different noises altogether. “Any time we heard a cough, we thought, ‘Uh oh.’” Despite the subsequent national lockdown, Normal People appeared as scheduled in April 2020. Before its release her flatmates made another banner, congratulating Edgar-Jones for being a part of this cool‑sounding show, however successful it might be. “I think it went online at 6.30am on a Sunday. I woke up to a couple of texts, people saying they’d just watched it, they loved it. That positive response, it was pretty immediate.” One of her flatmates made pancakes. They sat in the lounge and binge-watched the whole thing in six hours. Within days, the puffy fringe that Edgar-Jones wore on screen as Marianne was being discussed in national newspaper thinkpieces. Her co-star, Mescal, was briskly established as one of the most fancied men on the planet. There were novelty social media accounts devoted to obscure aspects of the show, including the chain necklace that Mescal wore. “I think I found it funny?” she says, of this obsessional aspect. “I learned in a hurry that I had to part with my idea of Normal People the moment it landed. That people were going to have their own relationship with, I dunno, a piece of jewellery I hadn’t thought about during the whole of filming. Because the show was theirs now.” She does remember an early FaceTime with her parents, as the noisy enthusiasm for the show began to take the form of a sort of national mania. Before her father worked at Sky, he had been a producer behind the original Big Brother run in the early 00s. Edgar-Jones was a toddler then, blissfully unaware of her father’s role in a UK media obsession. Belatedly, though, she was able to call on him for advice. “He told me to remember that it’s all a little bit silly. He said, ‘Take it seriously, but wear it lightly.’ I’m still trying to do that now.” Certain faces, films, books impressed themselves very deeply on the cultural hive-mind during 2020. “The stuff we read, the TV and films we watched,” Edgar-Jones says, “they all held a little more weight during those months, right? For a lot of people, that was the only escape we had.” She lost herself in Michaela Coel’s I May Destroy You, she remembers, and books including Delia Owens’ Where the Crawdads Sing, one of the great literary successes of the year. She wound up auditioning for the lead in an adaptation of Crawdads towards the end of 2020, shooting the movie the following summer. It meant another beloved literary character to try to peel off the page and do justice to on screen – or, as Edgar-Jones puts it: “Pressure! You’re coming to scenes that people have already formed a deep relationship with, and you’ve got a couple of hours in front of a camera to get it right for them.” She tried to take encouragement and energy from Owens’ source text, treating it as she had once treated a well-thumbed copy of Rooney’s novel, as a beautifully written crib sheet. One of the appeals of Fresh, her new thriller was that it had an original (read: not-yet-obsessed-over) screenplay. “If I didn’t nail exactly what was there on the page? Fine. Because hardly anybody had read what was there on the page.” Co-starring Sebastian Stan, Fresh is quite bloody, quite funny, quite shocking – and almost impossible to describe without ruining an early plot twist. Let’s just say that it deals with the trials, indignities and potential dangers of modern dating. Edgar-Jones, who drew on friends’ online experiences for the part, says she has never been on a dating app herself. This is about as far as she’s willing to go in discussion of her romantic life, at least with a notebook-wielding interviewer; instead, she offers a more general perspective on what the current dating scene looks like to people her age. “We shop for each other. We scroll. ‘I don’t want that. I don’t want that.’ You go on the date and you probably know within the first 30 seconds whether it’s right. But you can’t get out for at least two hours.” It sounds pretty awful when you put it like that, I say. And yet, she shrugs, this is the reality. “All my friends’ partners are people they’ve met by app. It does seem to be the only way people do it.” In Fresh, there is one bad dating choice imagined forward to violent and sexual extremes. Edgar-Jones has spoken before about how the sexual content of Normal People was arranged and filmed with such tact and sensitivity that she and Mescal came to think of it as the “gold standard”: a way that all actors, particularly young and inexperienced actors, could and should be treated when filming sensitive scenes in future. “Even while we were shooting, I knew deep down I was being spoiled. That it can’t always be like that. I’ve continued to be lucky in that I’m yet to work with a group that aren’t nice … But I’m not naive. I know that’s probably going to happen. I’m better prepared for it, I think.” How so? “I would feel safe to tell someone: ‘No,’” she says. “And for that to be a full sentence.” By now we’ve completed many loops and figure eights around the park. It’s almost time to say goodbye, but before we do I ask Edgar-Jones about those long, Rooney-ish emails she wrote to a friend. Did she ever get an answer to that question: is this how a person’s 20s are supposed to be? Edgar-Jones shakes her head. “Nope. Not yet.” She wonders, though, if one of the things that people her age feel as though they’ve missed out on is a sense of closure for their youth. “So many of my friends finished uni from their bedrooms, y’know? I’ve been thinking a lot about being in plays, for some reason. How, at the end of a play, there’s applause from the audience. The actors bow. There’s something about that, a conclusion like that, saying and hearing, ‘Thank you for this experience’ – it full-stops things. And I feel like for us, maybe we’ve all been left in the lurch. I don’t feel we’ve been able to full-stop things.” She leaves the thought there. We’ve arrived back at the boating pond and Edgar-Jones has a train to catch, to visit friends and family out of London. Then she’ll fly to LA for that nervy red-carpet debut. There’s just enough time for her to practise her hotshot-lawyer pose by the water’s edge once again. Actually, she admits, raising her chin, it was her mum and dad who suggested this whole pretend-you’ve-just-won-a-case thing. “They were teasing me, trying to get me to be less nervous. They don’t have any more of a clue about stuff like this than I do.” She wonders about abandoning the poised, one-foot-forward thing – instead taking to the red carpet purely as herself when the time comes. Next to the pond, she practises that pose, dropping her shoulders, grinning like a slightly shellshocked and baffled twentysomething who has spent the better part of two years in isolation, goofily throwing up both thumbs for good measure, finally collapsing into self-conscious laughter. Which of the poses to use? Edgar-Jones wanders off home to her folks, thinking it through.

2/26/2022,"When war broke out in 1939, the British government was faced with a giant and immediate problem: what to do with the 73,000 Germans and Austrians living in Britain who had become “enemy aliens” overnight. The answer was mass internment, a policy authorised by Churchill days after he took office as prime minister in May 1940. Police around the country were dispatched to arrest male nationals of axis powers – which would soon include Italy – aged between 16 and 60 and cart them off to prison. Some of these internees would be sent on perilous voyages to Canada and Australia, but the majority were taken to camps on the Isle of Man. One of these, Hutchinson camp, is the subject of Simon Parkin’s excellent new book. The policy of detaining civilians en masse without trial represents a dark chapter in Britain’s war. It grew out of the fear, stoked by the press, that “fifth columnists” had been sent to infiltrate the country and undermine British defences against the coming German invasion. Churchill realised as early as August that the threat was exaggerated, but by this time the arrests had been made, and many of the internees, who included women and children, would not be released for years. The most shameful aspect of internment was that it predominantly picked up Jewish refugees who had fled to Britain to escape the terror visited on them by Hitler’s stormtroopers. Parkin builds his narrative around the artist Peter Midgley, born Peter Fleischmann, a Jewish-German orphan who was just young enough to qualify for the Kindertransport and just old enough to be caught in the internment dragnet. In December 1938, SS officers stole from Midgley and the other children as their refugee train left Germany. Eighteen months later, in 1940, Midgley watched refugees being robbed again, this time by British soldiers at the corrupt and dysfunctional Warth Mills internment camp in Lancashire. The intentions of the British and German governments towards the Jews were very different, but the irony of their treatment in the country where they had sought asylum was not lost on the refugees. Hitler would gloat that year: “The British have detained in concentration camps the very people we found it necessary to detain.” There was a silver lining for some, however, as Midgley realised when he reached Hutchinson camp in Douglas that August. The camp consisted of a few fenced-off streets of requisitioned boarding houses, set around a lawned square, a hundred yards from the beach. Here, the Home Office inadvertently gathered the gold-top milk of artistic talent: film-makers and actors, musicians and fashion designers, architects and scientists, painters, sculptors and writers. As Parkin puts it: “It was as if a tsunami had deposited a crowd of Europe’s prominent men on to this obscure patch of grass in the middle of the Irish Sea.” The prisoners were placed under the benign care of Captain Hubert Daniel, a Mainwaring-esque former Lever Brothers ad man, and together they turned Hutchinson into a surreal artists’ retreat, more dadaist Hi-de-Hi! than Stalag Luft III. Dr Klaus Hinrichsen, an interned art historian, caught wind of the camp’s intellectual nature the day after his arrival, when he saw a group of men carrying chairs from one of the houses. Each chose a spot on the lawn a little away from the others, plonked the chair down, then stood on it and began to lecture on his specialist subject – Greek philosophy, Shakespeare’s sonnets, the industrial use of synthetic fibres – as an audience of internees gathered. The camp was packed with distinguished professors and experts, and they were determined to continue their trade whatever the British government might do. Hinrichsen and his housemate, the architect Bruno Ahrends, would develop these impromptu lectures into a busy cultural programme, delivered by a “cultural department” and approved by Captain Daniel. Soon there was a “Hutchinson University”, complete with a librarian. Later there would be piano recitals, theatre productions, art exhibitions, a vibrant newspaper, an artists’ cafe run by a Viennese patissier, and a “technical school” teaching engineering skills. The internees arrived at Hutchinson stressed and sometimes suicidal, but in the camp’s rarefied environment, with their basic needs catered for and few distractions, they began to thrive. The most famous Hutchinson resident was Kurt Schwitters, the Hanover-born artist whose work was defamed in Goebbels’s infamous “degenerate art” shows. His escape from Germany left Schwitters traumatised and epileptic, but Hutchinson restored him, and his time here comprised one of his most productive periods. He took the resourceful Midgley on as an assistant, honing his natural ability, so that when the young man was released he won a place at art school. He would later become a Royal Academician, and maintain for the rest of his life that “all the good things that have happened to me, happened as a result of my being there”, at Hutchinson. Even so, internment was a grim experience for most, and although Britain came to view it as an embarrassment, the government has never formally apologised. Lessons do not seem to have been learned. It is impossible to read this story and not think of the treatment of refugees who are crossing the Channel today. In a postscript, Parkin states that the UK subjects 24,000 people a year to immigration detention, half of whom are claiming refuge. Unlike in other European countries, there is no time limit on this form of custody. He also reminds us that in 2019 the Trump administration separated more than 2,000 migrant children from their parents at the Mexican border, and failed even to give them enough to eat. Parkin has told his story with energy and flair. The book is not without minor flaws: the cast of characters is dizzyingly large, and at times the narrative is obscured by extraneous information, but these do not detract from Parkin’s achievement. The Island of Extraordinary Captives is a powerful tribute to the wartime internees, and a timely reminder of how much Britain gained from their presence.
