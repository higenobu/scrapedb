12/12/2021,"This cake takes its inspiration from a Linzer biscuit. Two almondy cake halves sandwiched together with a raspberry centre. Raspberry jam has become the conserve of choice in a modern Linzer biscuit but the Linzer tart (of which the biscuits are a descendant) was originally filled with tart blackcurrant jam. To be honest, so long as the jam has some punch to it I don’t think it matters which one you choose. I’ve used damson, sour cherry and redcurrant jelly as well as the aforementioned, but strawberry and apricot would be too sweet.  Rather than ice this, I’ve played around with paper-cut snowflakes as icing sugar templates and the results are beautifully festive; a doily, too, works just as well. Serves 6unsalted butter 100g, at room temperaturecaster sugar 75geggs 2, separated, whites whisked to stiff peaksmarzipan 100g, gratedplain flour 75gground almonds 25gground cinnamon 1 tspbaking powder 1 tspraspberry jam 4 tbspicing sugar for dusting Heat the oven to 160C fan/gas mark 4 and grease and line 2 x 20cm round cake tins. Put the butter and sugar into a large bowl and beat with a hand-held electric whisk until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolks and whisk again until combined. Add the grated marzipan, flour, ground almonds, cinnamon and baking powder, then stir until well mixed. Fold the whisked egg whites into the batter, then divide the mixture evenly between the two cake tins and smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake in the centre of the oven for about 20 minutes until golden brown and springy to the touch. Turn the cakes out on to a wire rack to cool. Once cool, put one cake on to a plate, spoon the jam on top and spread it out evenly. Place the second cake on top. Cut out a round piece of paper just larger than the cake. Fold it into four and cut an intricate snowflake design out of it. Unfold the piece of paper and lay it on top of the cake. Dust the top with icing sugar before carefully removing the paper. You should be left with a beautiful delicate snowflake on top of your cake. Stored in an airtight container, this cake will keep well for up to 3 days. These biscuits are traditional Advent sweet treats in both the Netherlands, where they are usually eaten around 6 December (St Nikolaus day), and in Germany, where they are eaten throughout the whole run-up to Christmas. Usually they’re decorated with images relating to Nikolaus, and more often than not have windmills depicted on them. You can also buy special wooden rolling pins with pictured squares carved into them specifically for rolling this dough out at home. I don’t have one of these and I certainly don’t have the patience to create the intricate decoration it would involve without using one. Instead I use pretty cutters (I think snowflakes work best) to cut out festive shapes. Usually almond Spekulatius have a flaked almond base, but I’ve switched things up and adorned mine with them on top instead. These snappy (by this I mean crunchy and good to snap) biscuits are best eaten alongside a black coffee and are also brilliant crushed into a powder and mixed with melted butter to create a Christmas cheesecake or chocolate torte base. Makes about 30plain flour 150g, plus extra for dustingrye flour 50gbicarbonate of soda ½ tspground cinnamon 1½ tspground cloves ¼ tspgrated nutmeg ¼ tspcaster sugar 120gfine sea salt a pinchunsalted butter 125g, at room temperatureegg 1, beatenmilk for brushingflaked almonds 50g, for decorating Put all the dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl and stir with a wooden spoon. Add the butter and mix it into the flour using your fingertips until it has the consistency of fine breadcrumbs. Add the egg and bring everything together into a dough with your hands. (Alternatively, simply put all the ingredients into the bowl of an electric free-standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix until an even dough is formed.) Heat the oven to 170C fan/gas mark 5 and line 2 large baking sheets with non-stick baking parchment. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 3mm thickness. Cut out shapes with your cookie cutter and gently transfer them on to the prepared baking sheets, leaving 1cm between each to allow for spreading. Reroll the dough offcuts into more biscuits. Brush the tops with milk, then sprinkle some flaked almonds on to each one, pressing them down gently to ensure they stick. Bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes until golden all over. Allow to cool on the sheets for a minute before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. They will store well in an airtight container for up to 4 weeks. A celebratory chocolate that looks showstoppingly good yet is a cinch to make. In Germany, Kirschwasser, a double-distilled morello cherry brandy, is often used with chocolate, most famously in a Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte, and these little Swiss peaks are no exception – sometimes I also sit a sour cherry at the bottom of the foil case before piping the chocolate in. Makes about 30double cream 100mldark chocolate (50% cocoa solids) 200g, broken into piecesunsalted butter or coconut oil 30gKirschwasser or cherry brandy 1 tbsp Heat the cream in a saucepan over a medium heat, stirring from time to time to avoid it scorching on the bottom. Take it off the heat just before it comes to a boil. Add the chocolate and butter or coconut oil, and stir with a wooden spoon until both are dissolved. Mix in the Kirschwasser and beat for a minute until smooth and glossy. Refrigerate for 45 minutes so it stiffens up slightly. Lay out small foil chocolate cases on a baking sheet. Give the mixture a good stir through again, then spoon it into a piping bag fitted with a 1cm star-shaped nozzle. Pipe the mixture, with a swirling motion, into the foil cases, lifting the nozzle up at the very end to create a peak. Stored in an airtight container, these will keep well for 2 weeks. They don’t need to be refrigerated but I think they’re particularly good when a little cold, so I like to refrigerate them 15 minutes before serving. Christbrot is very similar to a Weihnachtsstollen (Christmas stollen), but lighter in texture, and is best eaten freshly baked without needing time to mature. This is one of the reasons why a Christbrot is more popular to bake at home than a Stollen each year. It isn’t hard to make Christbrot but the method involves a triple rise, so you’ll need to set a morning or afternoon aside if you choose to make it. Makes 1 loaf (serves about 6)mixed peel 75graisins 50gcurrants 50gdark rum 1 tbspplain flour 300g, plus extra for dustingcaster sugar 40gfine sea salt ½ tsplemon finely grated zest of ½orange finely grated zest of ½unsalted butter 50g, meltedegg 1fresh yeast 18g, or 9g of driedwhole milk 70ml, tepidflaked almonds 50g, to coatunsalted butter 50g, meltedvanilla sugar 40g (available online, or see note below)icing sugar 40g Put the mixed peel, raisins and currants into a bowl, pour over the rum and set aside to infuse while you prepare the dough. Put the flour, sugar, salt and citrus zests into a large bowl and mix together with a wooden spoon, then add the melted butter and egg. Crumble the yeast (or sprinkle if using dried) into the tepid milk and stir to dissolve. Pour the yeasted milk into the flour mixture and, using your hands, bring the ingredients together into a rough dough. Tip the dough on to a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until it becomes more elastic. Form it into a ball and nestle it into the bottom of the bowl. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and set aside in a warm spot to rise for 1-3 hours until almost doubled in size. (Alternatively, put the flour, sugar, salt and citrus zests into the bowl of a free-standing electric mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add the butter and egg. Pour in the yeasted milk and knead for 5 minutes until the dough is elastic. Cover the bowl and set aside, as above.) Knock the dough back with your fist and add the almonds and boozy dried fruit (along with any liquid). Knead the fruit and nuts through for a few minutes until evenly incorporated. Form the dough into a ball and return it to the bowl. Cover with the tea towel and set aside in a warm spot for about 20 minutes for a short second rise. Form the dough into a round loaf shape and place it on a baking sheet lined with non-stick baking parchment. Cover with a tea towel and leave somewhere warm to rise for a final 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 170C fan/gas mark 5. Bake in the oven for 35-40 minutes until brown all over and cooked through, checking after 25 minutes; if it is getting too brown cover it with a piece of foil for the remainder of the baking time. Transfer to a wire rack and brush with the melted butter repeatedly until all the butter is used up. Sprinkle with the vanilla sugar, then sift over the icing sugar. This is best eaten within a couple of hours after it’s baked. Or you can wrap it in foil and store in an airtight tin; it will keep for up to 3 days, after which it is still fine to toast for a further 2 days. Note: Vanilla sugar is very easy to make yourself. Pop a split vanilla pod into a jar of caster sugar and letting it infuse for a couple of days, or alternatively blitz half a vanilla pod with a small bag of caster sugar in a food processor for an instant version. At a push you can just use caster sugar, which will still be sweet and melt into the warm dough, but it won’t have the vanilla notes. These little biscuits are full of new year’s luck – shaped like coins for prosperity, full of gold from the egg yolk and decorated with a “lucky” mushroom – you’re bound to have a good year ahead if you eat one. Makes about 35plain flour 150gfine sea salt a pinchunsalted butter 80g, at room temperatureicing sugar 50g, plus extra for dusting and icingegg yolks 2vanilla extract ½ tspmilk for brushingflaked almonds to decorateglacé cherries halved, to decorate Heat the oven to 170C fan/gas mark 5. Line 2 large baking sheets with non-stick baking parchment. Put the flour, salt and butter in a mixing bowl and, using your fingertips, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the icing sugar and mix it through. Now add the egg yolks and vanilla extract and bring everything together into a dough with your hands. Knead for a few minutes. Dust the work surface with icing sugar and roll the dough out to a 3mm thickness. Using a fluted cookie cutter, cut out circles and place on the prepared baking sheets, leaving 1cm between each. Reroll all the dough offcuts into more biscuits. Brush the top of each with milk and place 1 flaked almond on the biscuit with a point in the centre. Bake for 8-10 minutes until golden brown. Let the biscuits cool on the sheet for a minute before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Lay a glacé cherry half on the centre end of each almond to create a mushroom top. Mix 1 tablespoon of icing sugar with a couple of drops of water to create a thick paste. Use the prong of a fork or a cocktail stick to dip into the icing. Now dot the iced prong on to the glacé cherry to create little white spots on the red “mushroom”. These little sweets came about one autumn when we found the ground on our usual path to school scattered with walnuts. After dropping the boys off I rushed home, scooping up as many nuts along the way as I could carry. Back in the kitchen all sorts of walnut creations took place; this one I wrote down in my notebook for Christmas. The flavours come from a German-Polish-border biscuit that Helga, our late German neighbour in Wales, used to put on her bunter teller. I asked her one year for the recipe, but she was reluctant to pass it on. The biscuit base was spread with apricot jam, a layer of marzipan next, followed by half a walnut crown all wrapped up in a glaze of vodka icing. In one bite-sized biscuit, they swept me directly to cold snowy cobbled streets with people’s breath hanging in clouds under the glow of street lamps. There was just something about them that seemed so old-fashioned that was hard to put my finger on – the vodka somehow brought a mysterious feeling of cold into your mouth. Makes about 20 squareswalnuts 200g, or walnut piecesicing sugar 75g, siftedvodka 1-2 tbspdark chocolate 180gcoconut oil ½ tspflaky sea salt to sprinkle on top Place the walnuts in a food processor and blitz for about 2 minutes until finely ground, then scrape down the sides of the processor and blitz again for a couple of minutes until the oils are released from the nuts and the mixture clumps together. Add the icing sugar along with 1 tablespoon of vodka and blitz again until a smooth paste forms. You may need to add a bit more vodka depending on how fresh the nuts are. Form the marzipan into a rectangle 1cm deep and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Put the chocolate and coconut oil into a heatproof bowl and place the bowl over a small saucepan with 1cm of water in the bottom. Turn the heat on low and wait for the chocolate to melt. Once it starts melting, stir so that the coconut oil is evenly dispersed. Take off the heat once the chocolate is glossy and fluid. Line a baking sheet with non-stick baking parchment. Cut the marzipan into 1cm squares and, using a fork held horizontally with the tines pointing upwards to balance the marzipan on, dip each square carefully into the chocolate, so that it is completely covered. Lift gently onto the baking paper and continue until all squares are covered. Sprinkle each square with a little flaky sea salt and allow to set before boxing up. Stored in an airtight container, these keep well for up to a week. Flammkuchen, often dubbed “German pizza”, is a very thin and crisp piece of dough topped with soured cream, onions and Schinken (cured ham). It originates from the German/French border region of Alsace – traditionally baked in a wood oven, it was invented by bakers to test the temperature of their ovens; if the oven was hot enough for bread, the Flammkuchen would only take a minute to cook. The dough is actually very similar to a strudel dough or rough filo (just flour, oil and water) and is incredibly easy to make. It’s important when making this at home to heat the baking sheet up in the oven first as this ensures a crisp base, or if you have a pizza stone that’s even better. I’ve given some suggestions for my favourite alternative flavour combinations below the recipe, but really anything goes for the dough. Makes 2 (serves 2 as a main or 4-6 as a snack)For the baseplain flour 200g, plus extra for dustingrapeseed oil 3 tbspwater 80mlfine sea salt a pinch For the toppingsoured cream or creme fraiche 150mlonion 1 small, finely dicedbrown mushrooms 150g, finely slicedflaky sea saltrapeseed oil for drizzlingfresh thyme leaves ½ tbsp Heat the oven to 200C fan/gas mark 7. Place 2 large baking sheets in the oven to heat. To make the dough, put all of the ingredients into a large bowl and mix using your hands. Knead for a couple of minutes until a supple, silky dough is formed. Divide the dough in half. On a floured surface, roll each half out as thinly as possible. So long as it fits on the baking sheet it doesn’t matter what shape it is, although I aim for a rough oval. Take the sheets out of the oven and lay the dough on top; this can be a little fiddly – I use a pizza shovel to do this but a large flat spatula or a hand supporting the underside centre of the dough while you move it also works. Working quickly, spread the soured cream evenly across each piece of dough and scatter the onion and mushrooms over the top. Sprinkle with sea salt and drizzle with a little rapeseed oil. Bake for 15-18 minutes until the edges are crisp and the Flammkuchen is starting to burnish on top. Sprinkle with thyme, slice into portions and serve immediately. VARIATIONSSchinken – replace the mushrooms with 200g finely diced Schinken or streaky bacon.Goat’s cheese and honey – switch the mushrooms for 200g goat’s cheese. Drizzle 1 tbsp honey on each portion, and sprinkle with thyme and some snipped chives before serving.Pesto and tomato – add 2 tbsp pesto to the soured cream and switch the mushrooms for 180g cherry tomatoes (halved). Add a handful of rocket at the end instead of the thyme.Red pepper and black olive – add ½ tsp sweet paprika to the soured cream. Switch the mushrooms for a finely sliced red pepper. Slice a handful of black olives in half and scatter them over both Flammkuchen. Add some fresh basil once it’s out of the oven.

12/12/2021,"The Oscar-nominated actor Naomie Harris has said a #MeToo incident on one of her recent projects prompted the “immediate” removal of the perpetrator, as she recalled another occasion when she was groped by a “huge star” who faced no censure. Harris, who played Moneypenny in the last three Bond films and was up for an Oscar for her role in Moonlight in 2017, declined to name either of the men allegedly responsible.  In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, she recalled an incident she has previously discussed in which “a huge, huge star” put his hand up her skirt during an audition. “What was so shocking about it was the casting director was there and the director, and of course no one said anything because he was – he is – such a huge star. That was my only #MeToo incident, so I felt very lucky given how rife that behaviour was. “Now things have definitely changed: I was on a project where there was a #MeToo incident and there was no hesitation, [the perpetrator] was immediately removed,” she said. Harris’s comments came as Claire Foy, who starred in Netflix drama The Crown, discussed violence against women as she promoted her latest project, A Very British Scandal. She plays the Duchess of Argyll, who was shamed in the 1960s after being secretly photographed giving oral sex to a man who was not her husband. A judge in her divorce case famously dismissed the duchess as “a completely promiscuous woman”. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Foy said: “Sex is the one thing you can get a woman on. It is a quick way to make a woman subhuman, wrong and weird. It happens in every walk of life.” Foy spoke forcefully about how women are often given the responsibility for their own safety, such as what to wear, or what hand signal to give if they are in danger, rather than the onus being on making men less violent. “Hundreds of women get attacked every single day,” she said. “It makes me so angry. How you can look into making women safe and think about getting more policemen – who women don’t trust – to look after them? We don’t need looking after. We don’t. We need people to stop killing and raping us. That’s all. It’s simple. And it’s awful to say, but that’s men. It’s time to say, ‘You sort that out. What are you going to do?’” She added: “It’s like saying that lots of dogs are killing cats, so let’s lock cats up and let dogs loose. It doesn’t make any sense. Women basically just get lumped with the emotional burden and responsibility of everything.”",Arts/Film,Naomie Harris says ‘huge star’ groped her during audition,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/12/naomie-harris-metoo-incident-actor-star-audition
12/12/2021,"Bands and DJs are resorting to inviting huge guest lists to their gigs in order to boost numbers because as many as four in 10 ticket holders are not turning up. When the government announced the roadmap out of lockdown in February, many shows sold out within hours, and the events that happened straight after things opened up were “bananas”, as one promoter described them.  But as time has gone on, the live music world has got noticeably quieter. Nights that sold out in an hour are nowhere near full, and the dancefloor is feeling unusually empty. “You always had people that didn’t turn up,” said artist manager Graeme Stewart. “It was around 5% normally, but you’re getting as much as 40% no-shows for some gigs now. It’s an enormous problem, and it’s happening for anything that’s ticketed.” Dublin-based promoter Will Rolfe agrees. He thinks there is a 40% no-show on average in the UK at the moment. “It’s a big issue and it’s having a real knock-on effect,” he explained. Sacha Lord, the co-founder of Parklife festival and night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester, said even the most popular line-ups are being affected. “We’re seeing a big drop-off, even at really hot, sold-out shows. It’s happening every single night, and it’s affecting all artists.” While Lord puts it down to people being worried about Covid – or actually having it – others say punters are forgetting or simply making other plans. “The first few events were bananas but as time goes on people are not as committed to nights they bought tickets to months in advance,” said Stewart. As a result, he said artists have resorted to making massive guest lists to boost numbers. “Notice how no one’s posting pictures of the crowd? If they did it would be empty.” Shows that had to be moved due to lockdowns and border closures have been particularly badly affected. Ticketing app Dice said almost 30% of gig-goers choose to get a refund when this happens and many acts, such as Bicep, Lianne La Havas and James Bay, had to reschedule on multiple occasions. Phil Hutcheon, founder and CEO of Dice, said that even though a lot of tickets are being sold, and the market feels quite buoyant, people are now far more likely to ask for their money back. He said: “People are returning tickets a lot more frequently now than pre-pandemic. The pattern we have seen is that each time a show is moved, the person who bought the ticket is a lot less engaged about attending.” Many, however, do not ask for refunds, which makes it hard to gauge how busy it will be. “You cannot message every person to see if they’re still coming, so no one knows what is going to happen. You are still getting money coming in from the tickets, but money is being lost on bar spend and security costs,” said Stewart. Rolfe said this is a particular issue for smaller venues because they are losing money on food and drink, it affects staffing costs and bands are missing out on merchandise sales. “It’s really hurting small venues that are reliant on every person being in the room.” Some genres are faring better than others, but Hutcheon thinks venues are likely to be more wary about who they book. “Electronic music is doing a lot better, clubs are busier, but it’s a lot more expensive to bring a live band from a different city than a DJ or hip-hop artist. Promoters and venues are more cautious now.” Lord said it is not just venues that are struggling: “The knock-on effects of this are phenomenal. It’s decimating the whole industry.”",Arts/Music,Bands and DJs count the costs as UK fans fail to show up for gigs,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/12/bands-and-djs-count-the-costs-as-uk-fans-fail-to-show-up-for-gigs
12/12/2021,"It’s not difficult to see why Nikolai Foster has chosen A Chorus Line as Curve’s first post-Covid Christmas show. Set in a rehearsal room, peopled by dancers nervously attending the final audition to become part of the chorus for a Broadway show, the 1975 musical has no flashy costumes, no stunning sets, no standout solo parts. Instead, it offers numerous characters, speaking, singing and dancing the often-harsh realities of their personal and professional lives (based on true stories told by dancers and recorded by Michael Bennett, who conceived, directed and choreographed the original production). Its continual focus-switching, from collective to individual experience, from gritty endurance to exuberant celebration, speaks powerfully to our pandemic-troubled times. Staging and design add impact to the dramaturgical focus-shifts. Against the soaring black walls of Grace Smart’s vast-seeming set, individuals appear small and vulnerable, their bright clothes an emblem of hope against darkness (Edd Lindley’s costumes). At times, individuals dominate the setting – faces, projected in closeup on to the back wall. Even here, though, the dancers are subject to manipulation – the hands holding the camera belong to Zach (Adam Cooper), director of the show, sternly making his selection, or to Larry (Taylor Walker), his impatient assistant.  The slight weaknesses of the production show up in an extended exchange between Zach and Cassie (Carly Mercedes Dyer), his former lover, who asserts her right to retreat from the limelight into a chorus of people who are “all wonderful”. Dyer’s performance beautifully balances assurance against self-doubt, but Ellen Kane’s choreography, elsewhere so dazzling, here seems less assured in its relation to the soul-shaking live music (orchestrated by David Shrubsole), while Cooper’s attitude tends to a coolness that smothers a nascent emotional charge. For the closing number, Howard Hudson’s lighting rig takes on a life of its own, dancing above the high-kicking chorus – identical in gold outfits, but each now unique, to our eyes, and all wonderful. A Chorus Line is at Curve, Leicester, until 31 December",Arts/Stage,A Chorus Line review – a timely revival of the 70s musical ,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/dec/12/a-chorus-line-curve-leicester-review-nikolai-foster
12/12/2021,"Children’s books bounced back in buoyant style in 2021. As bookshops reopened in the spring, children’s books enjoyed an 11% boost in sales against the equivalent period in 2019, according to the Bookseller. Michael Rosen’s own journey of recovery from Covid was movingly documented in Sticky McStickstick (Walker), illustrated by Tony Ross. A move towards greater diversity heralded a rich array of new and emerging talent. Hey, You! by Dapo Adeola (Puffin) took an empowering, celebratory look at growing up black, showcasing the work of 18 black illustrators. Amari and the Night Brothers by BB Alston (Farshore) is first in an outstanding fantasy series following a young black girl and her adventures in the Bureau of Supernatural Affairs. Neurodivergent author Elle McNicoll’s debut, A Kind of Spark (Knights Of), winner of the Waterstones and Blue Peter awards, told the story of an autistic girl campaigning for a memorial of witch trials. The Marcus Rashford Book Club was created to give books to children who need them the most; Rashford’s You Are a Champion, written with journalist Carl Anka, is the year’s bestselling children’s nonfiction book.  In September, more than 100 British authors and illustrators signed an open letter urging the UK publishing trade to reduce carbon emissions. The move reflected a trend for children’s books addressing climate change from Hannah Gold’s wonder-filled The Last Bear, illustrated by Levi Pinfold (HarperCollins), to Dara McAnulty’s Wild Child (Macmillan), a glorious journey into nature. The children’s book world also lost two much-loved creators this year. In May, Eric Carle died. Carle’s innovative approach to texture and colour were ahead of his time, as evidenced by his 1969 debut, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, and much more. Jill Murphy died in August. The Worst Witch was an instant success in 1974, inspiring seven further titles. Her prolific picture book output included the Bear and Large Family series, capturing the warmth and chaos of family life in a style that brought her millions of fans the world over. Fiona Noble In a year that provided plenty to scream and shout about, Barbara Throws a Wobbler (Puffin) felt both fitting and therapeutic. Nadia Shireen’s hilarious tale of a cat having an off-day (sock problems, a dropped ice-cream, you know the sort) charts Barbara’s descent into a huge tantrum, depicted as a raging, raspberry-coloured cloud. The turning point comes when Barbara acknowledges her foul mood – “If I made you, can’t I UN-make you?” – and begins squishing it down until it disappears completely. With illustrations the colour of bright, shiny jelly beans and a witty text that culminates in a genius guide to bad moods (to help people differentiate, say, “a tizzy” from “a huff”), Shireen’s latest gem ought to come on prescription. The masterly A Shelter for Sadness (Templar) by Anne Booth also features a tricky set of feelings depicted in scribbly blob form by David Litchfield, but here we witness a boy building a den for these emotions. Booth was inspired by the words of Holocaust victim Etty Hillesum, who wrote: “Give your sorrow all the space and shelter in yourself that is its due…” and the result is a perfectly pitched, heartfelt meditation about living alongside grief. Plenty of authors memorably celebrated difference this year, including the acclaimed writers and real-life partners Zadie Smith and Nick Laird, whose wonderful Weirdo (Puffin) stars Magenta Fox’s fabulously drawn guinea pig in a judo suit. Martin Stanev’s equally quirky The Planet in a Pickle Jar (Flying Eye) concerns a seemingly boring granny who has secretly been preserving Earth’s wonders in large glass jars for the enjoyment of future generations. Lauren Ace and Jenny Løvlie brought us The Boys (Little Tiger) which, like its award-winning predecessor The Girls, lovingly depicts the bonds between four friends. Author-illustrator duo Mick Jackson and John Broadley returned with another visual treat after 2020’s acclaimed look at nocturnal life, While You’re Sleeping. We’re Going Places (Pavilion) has us swooping, sailing and skating as it explores the many ways we travel through the world and through our lives, from childhood to old age. Broadley’s exquisite pen-and-ink drawings evoke the work of early 20th-century artist and designer Eric Ravilious but with an energy all of their own (regulars at London restaurant Quo Vadis will recognise Broadley’s style; since 2012 he’s provided the illustrations for its menus). Other exceptional nonfiction works came in the form of Flora Delargy’s graphic novel-esque Rescuing Titanic (Wide Eyed), a stunning debut about the supposedly unsinkable liner, and David Olusoga’s Black and British: An Illustrated History (Macmillan). Olusoga’s latest, aimed at children aged nine and over, follows bestselling middle-grade and adult versions of his examination of 1,800 years of black British life and it truly sings in picture book form with the history made even more vivid via a trove of old paintings, maps and photographs combined with bold artwork by Melleny Taylor and Jake Alexander. While not strictly a Christmas book, Richard Jones’s Little Bear (Simon & Schuster) felt really festive with its rich, red cover featuring a white polar bear amid a flurry of tiny golden snowflakes. The palm-size bear found by a boy in his garden is rendered so delicately by Jones that you can almost stroke its soft, fuzzy coat. A warm hug of a hardback, Little Bear is almost guaranteed to get children feeling cosy for Christmas. Should it fail, try giggling away any residual grumpiness with Shireen’s mood-boosting book. That should work whatever the season… Imogen Carter Whatever the age bracket, plot drives most children’s fiction. Two of 2021’s most original chapter books were actually top-tier thrillers disguised as “children’s literature”. In Elle McNicoll’s Show Us Who You Are (Knights Of), protagonist Cora (on the autism spectrum) navigates the neurotypical world with occasional frustration; her new friend Adrien (who has ADHD) views everything with an eyebrow raised. His father’s firm, the hugely plausible Pomegranate Technologies, creates holograms of deceased loved ones to help bereaved families. They want Cora to assist in getting their AIs just right. Then Adrien goes missing. This gripping second novel from the award-winning McNicoll asks important questions about what is real and how to remain true to oneself. In Nicola Davies’s career-crowning The Song That Sings Us (Firefly), the Jackie Morris starling on the cover belies the epic battle of mindsets within. An undeclared guerrilla war is raging between city-dwelling technocrats, beset by internal power struggles, and those who resist the extractivist machines. In this globe-spanning tale of high stakes and cross-species comradeship, three siblings come to understand their family history and the energetic field that connects all living beings. In a similar vein, anyone gripped by Piers Torday’s landmark The Last Wild series will find this year’s prequel, The Wild Before (Hachette), essential reading. Just as important as plot is world-building. In Efua Traoré’s immersive Children of the Quicksands (Chicken House), 12-year-old city girl Simi is sent to stay with the grandmother she barely knows in her village, where traditions remain vivid. Deprived of both wifi and explanations, Simi seeks to solve the mystery of her family rupture. The forest and Yoruba legend loom large in this original, dream-like debut that crackles with as much reality as magical realism. Forests full of signs also abounded in Amy Raphael’s debut novel, The Forest of Moon and Sword (Orion/Hachette), in which a resourceful young girl, Art, sets out to save her medicine woman mother, accused of witchcraft. Perhaps this year’s most three-dimensional female protagonist, though, was bored, plucky April, transplanted to a rapidly changing Svalbard by her workaholic scientist father in The Last Bear (HarperCollins). When April encounters an injured polar bear, she cannot ignore his suffering. Author Hannah Gold is careful to keep the bear as wild as possible within the confines of a children’s story and April is quick-witted and possessed of an optimism that frequently nearly backfires; the climate crisis is as much a part of the landscape as Svalbard’s crisp vistas, drawn by the excellent Levi Pinfold. Pictures remain an eloquent part of the reading experience, even in this age range. Two author-illustrators stood out this year. Tim Tilley’s debut novel, Harklights (Usborne), combined classic storytelling with distinctive, atmospheric graphics. Young orphan Wick labours in a match factory workhouse when he discovers a strange infant creature. But where does all the wood for the matches come from? And what of the forest dwellers whose homes are being destroyed? Finally, The False Rose (translated by Peter Graves, Pushkin) by Jakob Wegelius had it all: plot, world-building and detailed drawings of 1920s Lisbon and Glasgow, where this sequel proper to 2014’s The Murderer’s Ape is set. Narrated once again by the human-like ship’s engineer, Sally Jones, this engrossing nautical yarn unfolded as sumptuously as its artwork, recounting in flashback the extraordinary events kicked off by the discovery of a mysterious necklace. Kitty Empire This year, young adult books have enjoyed a profile not seen since the days of Twilight and The Hunger Games thanks to the BookTok phenomenon – a bookish corner of social media app TikTok, where young people post short videos inspired by the books they love. Bestseller lists were soon full of their recommendations, of largely backlist American titles, including Adam Silvera’s They Both Die at the End (Simon & Schuster), E Lockhart’s We Were Liars (Hot Key) and Kalynn Bayron’s Cinderella Is Dead (Bloomsbury). In new publishing, fantasy with strong feminist themes dominated. Raging against the patriarchy in spectacular style is Iron Widow (Rock the Boat), in which Xiran Jay Zhao reimagines the life of China’s only female emperor in a fusion of history and sci-fi action. In Lionheart Girl by Yaba Badoe (Zephyr), Sheba is born into a family of powerful West African witches and must escape the shadow of her dangerous mother; a dark and dazzling coming-of-age novel, rich in atmosphere and magic realism. Caroline O’Donoghue made her young adult debut with All Our Hidden Gifts (Walker), offering a fresh take on teenage witches in a contemporary Irish setting, its authentic view of friendships and relationships proving just as beguiling as the tarot readings and emerging powers. Books inspired by mythology further tapped into this trend, Jessie Burton’s Medusa (Bloomsbury) giving Greek mythology’s ultimate antiheroine the chance to answer back. A young girl cursed by the gods and exiled to an isolated island, Medusa’s is a story of self-discovery and survival. Olivia Lomenech Gill’s hypnotic full-colour art makes this one of the year’s most desirable gift books. Twenty years after Sephy and Callum’s story began in Noughts and Crosses, one of YA’s most loved series came to an emotional and exhilarating close in Malorie Blackman’s Endgame (Penguin), as compelling and timely as ever. Although very different genres, two of 2021’s most striking British debuts were also driven by themes of race and power. Faridah Àbíké-Íyímídé’s smart and moreish high-school thriller Ace of Spades (Usborne) sees the only two black students in an exclusive school team up against an anonymous bully, exposing a sinister campaign of privilege and corruption. The gritty realism of life in Peckham, south London, was spliced with a mind-bending time travel thriller in Femi Fadugba’s cinematic The Upper World (Penguin). Two teenagers race against time itself in an intriguing mix of high-octane action, whip-smart dialogue, physics and philosophy. Alice Oseman proved she was one of the most relevant and relatable voices in teenage fiction, winning the Bookseller’s YA book prize with Loveless (HarperCollins), the wise and witty story of a girl’s self-discovery at university. In May, Heartstopper Volume 4 (Hodder) followed, the latest in the graphic novel series centred on a young gay couple. A joyful, tender look at first love and relationships with an inclusive cast, it will be adapted for TV by Netflix in 2022. For an unmissable festive treat, Juno Dawson’s Stay Another Day (Quercus) follows three siblings heading home to Edinburgh, where their perfect middle-class Christmas is soon threatened by some very big family secrets. Riffing on Christmas romcom themes, it’s a delicious family drama with a gritty contemporary edge.

12/12/2021,"Bicarb provides that important melt-in-the-mouth almost sour flavour. I love short shortbreads that kind of disappear – it’s the bicarb that does that. I use it to dry out meat prior to cooking as it helps make the skin super crisp. I tend to do ½ teaspoon of bicarb to 2 tsp of salt. You rub it all over a joint – or at Christmas, a chicken or a turkey – and leave it in the fridge overnight.  Making honeycomb is a fun thing to do at Christmas – although be careful. It’s about taking the caramel to the perfect point; you want the flavour and the amber colour, but there’s a fine line between terracotta and burnt. The problem with caramel is that when you take it off the heat, it continues to cook. You’ve got to keep your eye on it and not be tempted to touch it. You then add the bicarb, it bubbles up, and you pour it into a tray. Honeycomb is good plain, crumbled on a simple vanilla ice-cream, or if I’m going to coat it, I tend to balance it with quite a dark chocolate. Bicarb is great for cleaning too. If on Christmas Day, a pot gets too black (which it normally does in our house as we’ve got an Aga) you can just chuck some in and boil it back up.

12/12/2021,"Your typical new block of flats is something like this: corridors and lobbies, often windowless, lead to flats where everything is the minimum required by regulations. There is little wit or thought in the layout or pleasure in individual spaces – just the pursuit of the shortest route to squeezing in the maximum possible accommodation – nor in the stuff of which the building is made. The external walls, whether finished in skinny brickwork or some other cladding material, have a just-stuck-together feeling. There is no sense of substance, just an expedient assemblage of building products, which, if you tap them, will probably sound dull and hollow. You have to trust that these outcomes of opaque technical and regulatory procedures won’t burn or leak or fall off, but you have no particular reason to do so. A House for Artists in Barking, east London, designed by the young architectural practice Apparata, sets out to be the opposite. The journey from street to home is by external stairs and balconies that give you fresh air and views and a sense of space and of connection to the neighbourhood. There is enough space for residents to inhabit balconies with plants and personal objects while still leaving room for circulation. Ceilings are high and the walls to the apartments are mostly glass, which allows light to flood in. Large windows and doors can be folded open in good weather, such that inside and outside spaces flow into each other.  There are no lobbies or corridors inside the block’s 12 flats, most of them two-bedroomed, which increases their sense of space. There is some flexibility in their layout, with the possibility of relocating the kitchen and adding or removing a bedroom to accommodate children arriving or growing or moving out, or an elderly relative coming to live. The idea, says Astrid Smitham of Apparata, is to reflect “the diverse configuration of people’s lives today”. Little is wasted. If something is needed for functional reasons, such as a route for escaping from fire, it is also taken as an opportunity for enjoyment. The structure is solid concrete, whose slightly shiny coating stops it streaking in the rain, and whose cement content is reduced with the help of alternative materials, so as to minimise its carbon footprint. It is reassuringly substantial. You can see and feel the weight of the building. The ceilings of the flats are in exposed concrete, too, which helps you know that you are in something built by human beings, out of materials that have a physical presence. This unusual block of flats comes from unusual origins. It is, as the name suggests, for artists, the result of a six-year effort by the arts organisation Create London to provide affordable rented housing, at 65% of the market rate, for creative people. It has been realised in collaboration with the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham. Grayson Perry lent his support, as an “advocate and sounding board”. The aim of the project is not only to provide affordable housing for cash-strapped creatives – whose skills run from printmaking to photography to video art – but also to contribute something to the neighbourhood, to harness a little of artists’ well-known ability to bring a bit of life to a place. The ground floor is a glass-walled community space, where artists can make and exhibit their work, or hold adult education classes or parties or indeed anything that might contribute to the life of the area. (The well-lit flats are also good places to work, but tenants don’t get individual studio spaces.) Nor are the flats conceived only as isolated residential units, but also as parts of the community of the whole block. Residents will be encouraged to take responsibility for its management. On one floor there are double doors in the party walls between flats, soundproofed when closed, which can be opened up to join living rooms into one big collective space. The arrangement of the block, with three flats on each of the four floors above ground level, reached by those shared balconies, encourages communication between the flats. A House for Artists is a work of simple pleasures and straightforward good things. Its design is based on a smart interpretation of the regulations concerning escape from fire; by providing external balconies on both sides of the block, it does away with the need for internal corridors. It also has architectural intelligence. There’s thought in the placing of the joints in the concrete, such that they help create an illusion that the building is made of large masonry blocks, which reinforces the impression of strength. It looks a thing of pillars and beams – basic elements of architecture at least since ancient Egypt. But then, just when it might become too serious for its own good, it lightens the mood with circles and triangles cut into the walls as if it were a child’s toy, with further triangular shapes on the roofline. It manages to speak to the disparate elements of the William Street Quarter, a recent regeneration project that stands next door. This is a bizarre combination of big glum grey blocks, uncannily like the least charming estates of the 1960s, and rows of little pitched-roofed brick houses. A House for Artists, with its triangles and oblongs and its middle-sized scale, has something of both, while being more appealing than either. It’s a perky and punchy building, at once big and small and grand and intimate. It is robust rather than exquisite, severe more than cosy, but still a place to call home. Create London see it as a prototype: now that they have their Barking example they want to pitch the idea elsewhere. Here’s hoping that more like this are built, and not only for creatives.

12/12/2021,"When a young family died mysteriously on a trail in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains in August, authorities scoured the area for clues. Maybe there was a gas leak from a nearby mine. Maybe the family drank water that contained toxic algae. In the end, as a new report showed, the answers were more prosaic, if just as tragic: the triple-digit temperatures and tough terrain created a fatal situation.  Nearly eighty pages of investigative reports obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle lay out the tragic missteps that led to the death of the young family and hold important lessons about the dangers of hiking in a grueling climate. The family, Ellen Chung, 31, Jonathan Gerrish, 45, along with their 1-year-old daughter, Miju, and dog, Oski, set out to hike at the Hites Cove Loop trailhead in a remote area of the Sierra Nevada national forest on 15 August. Their truck was found near the trailhead two days later and crews soon found the bodies of Gerrish and Miju – with Chung’s body a little bit higher on a hillside. The local sheriff’s office announced in October that the family died of overheating and probably dehydration. “This is an unfortunate and tragic event due to the weather,” Mariposa county sheriff, Jeremy Briese, said at the time. The records show that Gerrish had used the AllTrails app to map out the hike and that he had hiked a portion of the same loop in May 2017. But the temperatures at the time had been much lower and the 2018 Ferguson fire hadn’t yet burned out tree canopy in the area. Grueling mid-day temperatures and a lack of shade had moved locals in recent years to avoid the hike during the summer. But the family was new to the area: they had moved to Mariposa, in the Sierra foothills, during the pandemic and purchased numerous properties. Chung was a yoga instructor and graduate student and Gerrish was a Snapchat engineer. According to the report, a US Forest Service volunteer who had hiked the nearly eight-mile loop more than a dozen times told a deputy the family appeared “completely unaware of the dangers”. They carried only a sippy cup and a backpack with a 2.5-liter reservoir for water, the records show. For Wesley Trimble, a communications and creative director with the American Hiking Society, the tragic incident serves as a reminder to be prepared when going hiking, including by planning before they ever leave the house. He advises telling people where you are going and when to expect you back. “People often don’t think about it, but it’s a critical step: telling a neighbor or a family member that you are going to a specific location and that you’ll be in touch when you are back in an area with a cell signal,” Trimble says. And if you don’t return when you expect, give someone specific instructions, like the sheriff’s office for the county where you are hiking, if they don’t hear from you at a specified time. Another way to plan before hitting the trail is to really look at maps and come up with a game plan, including when to turn around based on timing, even if it means not reaching a desired destination. “In the winter time frame, that might mean getting back before it’s dark, and in warm weather it might be looking at the forecast,” says Trimble. The day of the Mariposa family’s hike, the temperatures were in the upper 70s in the morning, but rose to 109 in the afternoon when they were on the trail. It shows it’s important to consult detailed weather predictions, Trimble says – and to check the weather not just with the widget on a smartphone, but with better technology. Noaa has a website that can do pinpoint forecasting on a map, which will give a much better idea of what the forecast is, he says, because geography plays a massive role in weather. Trimble also suggests checking in with locals about a trail – a gear shop or even a tourist office will have insight into local conditions that may not be listed on a trail-mapping app. The American Hiking Society has a list of the ten essential items that they think everyone should have when heading out for a trek. For hikes during hot weather, it’s essential to haul enough water. “It’s hard to give people a very specific number with water,” says Trimble, though most hiking experts say about 16 ounces or a half liter per hour per person, for moderate temperatures and terrain. “If you are hiking in triple degree temperatures you will need at least a liter of water for every hour you plan to be out,” he says. In addition, for warmer-weather hiking, it’s important to be familiar with the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. “You want to be able to pick up on if you or someone is experiencing nausea and headaches and other symptoms, because if you are hiking in hot temperatures it’s a good sign that you are probably starting to get dehydrated,” says Trimble. “Make sure everyone is drinking water consistently – by the time you are thirsty, you are already starting to become dehydrated.”",News/US news,The tragic missteps that killed a young California family on a hike,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/12/tragic-death-young-california-family-hike
12/12/2021,"Acomet is on a collision course with Earth. The targets in this shrill, desperately unfunny climate change satire directed by Adam McKay are more scattershot. According to stoner PhD student Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence) and her professor, Dr Randall Mindy (a self-consciously tic-y Leonardo DiCaprio), the asteroid is the size of Mount Everest and due to hit in six months. The pair try to warn Meryl Streep’s President Orlean about the impending “extinction-level event”, only to find her preoccupied by the midterm elections. They attempt to raise awareness on breakfast TV, but anchors Jack and Brie (Tyler Perry and Cate Blanchett) can’t help but give their bad news a positive spin. The only person with enough money to intervene is tech entrepreneur Peter Isherwell (Mark Rylance), who wants to mine the comet for its “$140tn worth of assets”. Party politics, celebrity gossip and social media memes are swiped at too. It feels cynical, then, when Timothée Chalamet shows up with no real narrative purpose other than to snog Lawrence.  As Garry Marshall’s cursed holiday trilogy Valentine’s Day, New Year’s Eve and Mother’s Day has already proved, an ensemble cast stacked with A-listers is no guarantee of a good time. Neither is McKay’s bombastic, shake-you-by-the-shoulders direction.

12/12/2021,"From her breakthrough role in Secretary, wearing stilettos, a pencil skirt and manacles and attempting to operate a stapler with her chin, to her directorial debut which digs into the messy truths about motherhood, Maggie Gyllenhaal has always been attracted to what she has described as “troubled women. The ones that are a real challenge. They really need me.” It’s a quote that really gets to the heart of what distinguishes Gyllenhaal. An Oscar-nominated actor, and now– with her Elena Ferrante adaptation The Lost Daughter – an award-winning screenwriter and director, she is drawn to the kind of women whose stories don’t usually get told. She delves into the uncomfortable angles and sharp edges of her characters and found her niche by not quite fitting into the mould.  The mould – that cookie-cutter starlet formula – was particularly entrenched when Gyllenhaal was starting out in the late 90s. And her beauty – the heart-shaped face dominated by huge ice-blue eyes, the slightly melancholy downward slant to the lips – has always felt as though it was transposed from another time. You could imagine her as a contemporary of Mary Pickford in the era of silent cinema. The industry fretted that she was not conventionally “hot” enough, a criticism that Gyllenhaal brazened out at the time, but which she later conceded was “a hard thing to hear”. And when it wasn’t trying to manoeuvre her into a sexpot persona, Hollywood was instead dismissing her as “quirky” – a description she firmly rejected, stating that: “Describing someone as quirky is a way of erasing them.” Perhaps the fact that Gyllenhaal’s first major role was as Lee, the submissive office worker in Steven Shainberg’s BDSM romance Secretary, added to the industry’s confusion as to where exactly she fitted into the somewhat homogenised mainstream movie landscape. She brought an apple-cheeked sweetness to the film’s transgressive themes, a forceful emotional intelligence which diffused any potential charges of prurience that the picture might have otherwise attracted. Consequently, she threatened to blow a gasket in the Hollywood production line. Director Laurie Collyer, who cast her as an ex-con drug user and mother in the gritty drama Sherrybaby, realised early on that one of Gyllenhaal’s major strengths as an actor was the very thing that set her apart from many of her contemporaries. In an interview to promote the release of the film, she explained: “I think celebrity culture breeds conformity and Maggie is truly nonconformist, truly finding her own way. Even just the way she dresses – I know it sounds really superficial, but it all represents something: she’s her own person.” Gyllenhaal was born into the movie industry, but her upbringing didn’t fit the template of the second-generation Hollywood brat. Born in New York on 16 November 1977, Margalit Ruth Gyllenhaal is the older sister of the actor Jake Gyllenhaal, and the daughter of director Stephen Gyllenhaal (Paris Trout, Family of Spies) and screenwriter and director Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal (Losing Isaiah, Bee Season, Running on Empty). She only discovered that her first name was Margalit – a nod to her mother’s Jewish heritage – rather than Maggie when she asked for her birth certificate in order to take her husband Peter Sarsgaard’s name. She has jokingly described her parents as being somewhere to the left of Trotsky but credited them with engendering in her the political engagement which has been core to her identity. She has always maintained that, “being politically active is incredibly important to me. My parents have been politicised and radical throughout my life – they taught me that I’m a part of a global community and it’s partly my responsibility to fight for what’s right.” Gyllenhaal’s political activities range from driving voters to the polling station in Florida, speaking out in support of the jailed whistleblower Chelsea Manning, and hosting a benefit for Pussy Riot. More controversially, in 2005 she took aim at US foreign policy, suggesting that the United States “is responsible in some way” for the 9/11 terror attacks. Subsequently, a Maggie Gyllenhaal fan-run website had to close comments after it was bombarded with criticism. Gyllenhaal at first doubled down, saying that “not to have the courage to ask these questions is to betray the victims of 9/11”. But later she acknowledged: “I regret what I said, but I think my intentions were good. Neither the red carpet nor an interview about a movie is the right place to talk about my politics.” Another key lesson learned from her parents was that of the vagaries of a movie industry in which “you can be on top of the world and then the next year you can be nowhere. And then, later, you’re interesting again; and then, suddenly, you’re not. I watched that happen to them, and I watched it hurt them. I think I’m a bit armed by having seen that.” It’s a pragmatic approach which has enabled her to be unfazed, though slightly irked, by questions assuming there is a sibling rivalry between her and Jake, whose career took off a few years before hers did with the film Donnie Darko. Gyllenhaal’s insider’s eye view of the way the industry works – she started out in small roles in her father’s films, and appeared as Jake’s sister in Donnie Darko – also facilitated a smart balance in her own choices, weighing high-profile blockbuster-type films, like the Julia Roberts vehicle Mona Lisa Smile and Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, against more daring and challenging independent projects. Notable examples of the latter include Frank, in which Gyllenhaal played a scaldingly ill-tempered musician opposite Michael Fassbender, who was obscured throughout within a papier maché head. And then there was The Kindergarten Teacher, a profoundly uncomfortable portrait of a woman who becomes obsessed with nurturing the poetic talent of one of her six-year-old charges. Gyllenhaal enjoyed sneaking into screenings during the film’s festival run and eavesdropping on the audience’s squirming discomfort. Television also provided Gyllenhaal with meaty opportunities, such as the sex-worker-turned-porn director Candy in The Deuce – she agreed to the role on the condition that she could serve as a producer on the project, giving her input in the writing and editing. She also won a Golden Globe for her performance in the BBC political thriller series The Honourable Woman. What defines her as an actor, according to her friend and Honourable Woman co-star Genevieve O’Reilly, is the fact that “Maggie is naturally and confidently curious. She is unafraid to ask questions. She is a really active listener and has a gentle honesty which provokes thought and conversation.” She adds: “Maggie is someone you lean in to. You can’t help it. I think she has a quiet fire at her core that is at once warm and potent, audacious and fiercely intelligent.” Gyllenhaal brings all this to bear in her superb, sinuous adaptation of The Lost Daughter. There’s an obvious kinship between Gyllenhaal and Ferrante – both are drawn to difficult, unpredictable female characters. And with what now seems to be an act of rare foresight, Ferrante granted permission for the adaptation on the condition that Gyllenhaal, and nobody else, directed it. “She said it has to be me, which I took as a real vote of confidence. I needed that at the time.” The Lost Daughter has already made its mark on the awards circuit, picking up Best Picture, Best Screenplay, the Breakthrough Director award and the Outstanding Performance (for Olivia Colman), at the Gotham Awards. Whether the film will achieve the same success elsewhere is less certain – it is, after all, a portrait of an “unnatural mother” (played by Colman, and as a younger woman, Jessie Buckley) which refuses to condemn her maternal failings. She’s the kind of character that conventional audiences and awards voters are likely to find challenging, ambiguous and a little bit scary. A perfect fit, then, for Maggie Gyllenhaal.",Arts/Film,Maggie Gyllenhaal: from ‘difficult’ roles to lauded Hollywood director,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/12/maggie-gyllenhaal-from-difficult-roles-to-lauded-hollywood-director
12/12/2021,"In an era of environmental awareness and conspicuous displays of sustainability, you might not expect a rise in the number of people with the means and appetite for a £50m floating fortress of solitude. But, in part because of the coronavirus crisis, the superyacht industry is booming – and the number of vessels under construction or on order worldwide has hit a new record. According to figures revealed in the latest edition of Boat International’s Global Order Book, more than 1,200 superyachts are slated to be built – a rise of 25% on last year.  “The market’s never been busier,” said Will Christie, a superyacht broker. “And I’ve been in the industry 20 years. A lot of people say they appreciate the safety of being on a yacht during the pandemic. But it’s also because whereas in previous eras the people with enough money were too busy in the office to justify the purchase, these days they can work from anywhere. “I had one client who sent his trading terminals by plane so he could use them onboard – he’d be kitesurfing in the afternoon and then go back to his desk.” Christie said shipyard order books were typically full until 2025 – meaning clients are prepared to pay a premium to take over someone else’s slot if it can be delivered years earlier. He argued that the ability to transport your holiday home to a different location at a moment’s notice was deeply appealing. “Everybody just wants freedom, and ultra-high-net-worth individuals can afford it,” he added. “The ability to escape anywhere is very attractive in the current climate. They think, I don’t need to be stuck in the office, and if you’re worth billions, why should you be?” Critics of the boom in superyachts point to the vastly disproportionate environmental damage produced by the super-rich. “Whether it’s this or private jets or trips to space, they’re just sticking two fingers up at the rest of society,” said Peter Newell, professor of international relations at Sussex University. “It’s decadent. They’re not comfortable with the constraints that come with accepting collective responsibility for the fate of the planet.” Newell, the lead author of a Rapid Transition Alliance report which called for policymakers to target the “polluter elite” to limit their carbon consumption, saidindustry claims of moves to a more sustainable model were unconvincing. He called for government action. “You can’t just rely on people’s empathy – it has to be tax and regulation,” he said. “But it is very very hard with a mobile elite that can move its money and its property around.” Of the 1,200 superyachts on order or under construction, 27 would be more than 100 metres long, the Global Order Book said. The REV Ocean, being built by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Røkke, will measure 183m, making it the biggest in the world. It features a “moon pool” through which a submarine will be deployed for ocean research. Some of the more eye-watering features of existing superyachts include helicopter landing pads, open-air cinemas, and – in the case of the UFC fighter Conor McGregor – a “jousting platform”. The economic anthropologist Richard Wilk, distinguished professor at Indiana University in the US, said: “Of course, if you add every superyacht together, it’s just a blip on total greenhouse gas production. But it is symbolic – and the global impact of the 2,000-odd billionaires on the planet are very significant. So it’s part of a pattern of overconsumption by the upper crust.” In research with his colleague Beatriz Barros, he found that the average billionaire had a carbon footprint thousands of times that of the average person. The global average footprint of CO2 emitted per person is just under five tonnes, while they estimated that Roman Abramovich – the top polluter according to their list – was responsible for about 33,859 tonnes of carbon emitted in 2018. More than two-thirds of that was the product of his yacht, the 162.5-metre Eclipse. As well as fuel when the vessel is in use, Wilk said, “even when [the owners] are not onboard, they usually have a substantial permanent crew there, using all kinds of relatively inefficient systems. They might call the captain and ask him to take the yacht from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean to meet them. So you can greenwash it, but it doesn’t make much difference.” Sympathy for superyacht owners may not have been enhanced by a recent intervention from Australia’s richest woman, the mining magnate Gina Rinehart. In a video recorded from the deck of her own vessel in front of an emerald sea, she complained that there were not enough spaces to dock superyachts in Queensland. “For instance, we’ve just experienced days of very rough water from the southern Queensland border to the Capricorn Coast,” she said. “Then, when we arrived at the coast not feeling that great after two very rough sleepless nights and a rough day, many yachts were outside the marinas, given the lack of marinas.” Queensland might suffer because overseas superyacht owners would be less likely to visit, she added. “‘These superyachts need marinas too – sadly lacking for vessels over 50 metres. It’s time for more marinas large enough to cater not only for small and medium yachts but larger ones too.”",News/World news,Sailing away: superyacht industry booms during Covid pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/superyacht-industry-booms-during-covid-pandemic
12/12/2021,"Theatres face a peak Christmas season with bookings down by as much as 50%, while restaurants and other attractions could see mass cancellations, as a result of the government’s new Covid restrictions. The Society of Independent Theatres said regional and smaller theatres would be especially hard hit by “plan B” government restrictions and concerns over the Omicron variant during a period when they generate about a third of their income.  High street retailers are also braced for customers to seek protection from the spread of the virus by shopping online for Christmas presents, hitting revenues and plunging many into losses. Official figures on Friday showed economic growth almost stalled in November and several forecasters said the UK was heading into 2022 in a weakened position. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “It is like Groundhog Day for many businesses. There is going to be downward pressure on consumer confidence and that is going to hit sales. It means the economy is unlikely to grow at all in the last three months of the year and be very weak in the first half of next year.” Business leaders have called on the government to extend VAT relief and reductions in business rates, while the TUC said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, should bring back the furlough scheme and increase sick pay to prevent businesses from going bust. Sunak is known to be watching how businesses cope with restrictions before committing himself to an increase in spending, though a shift to more stringent measures over the next couple of weeks is likely to force his hand. Many business owners have seen revenues hit by rising inflation, a lack of trained staff and falling consumer confidence. Some hospitality firms, especially in London, have resorted to paying signing-on fees for staff, only to be hit later by large numbers of cancellations. Heathrow said passenger numbers were 60% lower in November than before the pandemic and there were “high cancellations” among business travellers concerned about being trapped overseas for Christmas as Omicron spreads. Theatres now have to ask visitors to wear masks but do not have to check for Covid-19 tests or vaccine passports. However, some large venues are already doing so. Jon Gilchrist, executive director of events venue Home in Manchester, said: “More and more venues will move towards a Covid pass system and are set up to do that to further reassure audiences that theatres are a safe environment.” John Plews, chair of the Society of Independent Theatres and artistic director at the Gatehouse in north London, said that even some small theatres were considering asking attendees for a proof of vaccine or a test, although it would be too costly for many. He said the society’s members had seen bookings for Christmas shows hit by between 20% and 50% already because of concern about the Omicron variant and because bigger venues were heavily discounting tickets in order to fill seats. “Passports mean employing extra front-of-house staff,” he said. Gilchrist said the government’s advice to work from home could have an impact on venues, particularly those in central London. But he said bookings currently remained “encouraging” and there was “room for optimism that we can have a good Christmas in the sector”. Jon Morgan, director of government-funded advisory body the Theatres Trust, said: “Over time, working from home means there will be a reluctance to go into town to see a show. It is a nerve-racking time for the industry.” Philip Miller, boss of Adventure Island and Sealife Adventure on Southend seafront, said bookings to see Santa were down by 50%. He said: “It’s like a graveyard. I’m talking to staff about them going home.” “The chancellor is going to have to do something. Hospitality was just getting back on its feet, but if this situation goes on many firms are going to go under.” Flair Gougoulia, owner of a Greek restaurant in Stratford-upon-Avon, said: “These are scary times. Stratford survives on 5-6 million visitors a year from China, America and the rest of Europe and the town was on its knees after Covid hit. “Christmas party bookings are down by up to a half on some days and the situation does not look like improving. Businesses were relying on a good December. What’s happening now is a kick in the teeth.”",News/Business,England’s theatres and restaurants fear another ruinous Christmas,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/12/englands-theatres-and-restaurants-fear-another-ruinous-christmas
12/12/2021,"Boris Johnson appears to have broken Covid laws, Keir Starmer has said after a picture emerged of the prime minister hosting a quiz for Downing Street staff last Christmas. The Labour leader, who is also a former director of public prosecutions, said it was a “very serious” revelation and “hard to see” how Johnson’s attendance in a room with aides pictured wearing tinsel and a Santa hat was “compliant with the rules”.  However, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, dismissed the leaked photo, suggesting he thought it showed the reports of parties held in No 10 in defiance of lockdown and tier restrictions were overhyped. Not all Tory MPs were convinced, though. Steve Baker, a senior Conservative backbencher, said despite assurances from Johnson that no social gatherings were held last year by senior government advisers, it was “pretty obvious now that hasn’t happened”. Boris Johnson pictured hosting Number 10 Xmas quiz ‘in breach of Covid Laws’https://t.co/wkZh77S0Gv pic.twitter.com/BYg7NJXOk3 Amid waning support from Tory MPs and in public opinion polls, the image that will put further pressure on Johnson shows him sitting with staff while not social distancing on 15 December 2020. According to the Sunday Mirror, he joined the quiz halfway through and hosted one of the rounds, thanking staff for their work during the pandemic. While Johnson presented the quiz virtually, No 10 staff reportedly huddled around computers to confer on answers and drank wine and beer. London was in tier 2 at the time, meaning that while working together was permitted, mixing between households for social reasons was banned, including Christmas events. Asked if he thought Johnson had broken the law, Starmer told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “It looks as though he was. He must have known that other groups were in other rooms in his own building. “This is very important because he has damaged his authority. He is now so weak, his party is so divided – he can’t deliver the leadership this country needs. “We’ve got a very important vote coming up next week and he can’t even discharge the basic functions of government. He is the worst possible leader at the worst possible time.” Zahawi said Starmer was wrong and accused him of “being political” in his criticism of the prime minister. The education secretary said reported parties in Downing Street and the Department for Education last Christmas would “quite rightly” be investigated by the cabinet secretary, Simon Case. But he added: “My email box is full of people thinking that he was sort of at parties with guests and all sorts of things happening. Actually, they can now make their mind up when they see this picture of the prime minister on a virtual screen, on a Zoom call thanking his team, who are in the building because they have to respond to a national emergency.” But Baker, who is relaunching the pressure group Conservative Way Forward in the new year, said the government needed to comply with both the letter and spirit of the restrictions politicians had imposed on the public. He accused ministers of “creating a miserable dystopia” and warned the Conservatives would “continue to drift into authoritarianism” if further curbs were announced in the run-up to this Christmas.",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson quiz photo seems to show he broke Covid laws, says Keir Starmer",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/12/boris-johnson-quiz-photo-covid-laws-keir-starmer
12/12/2021,"Is Bryony Lavery Philip Pullman’s daemon? Her adaptation of La Belle Sauvage goes to the heart of the first volume of Pullman’s Book of Dust trilogy and, daemon-like, expresses its essence. Clear and swift, it brings an extra bounce of humour to the tangle of speculation and saltiness that makes the novel at once provoking and compelling. “How do you know about the uncertainty principle?” “I live in a pub.” This is only one of the ways in which Nicholas Hytner’s exciting production (co-directed with Emily Burns and James Cousins) gets things right. Pullman’s novel, set before His Dark Materials, with Lyra as a baby being protected by potboy and potgirl Malcolm and Alice, swims between the familiar and the fantastic: it is a rush of climate catastrophe, adventure, alethiometers, Oxford cityscapes, pubescent stirrings and the repressions imposed by an ironclad Christian regime. Its layers, and its twisting between the antique and the futuristic, are suggested here in Paul Arditti’s delicately thrumming sound design and by Luke Halls’s videos and Jon Clark’s lighting, which swirl over and transform Bob Crowley’s sets: placid-looking woodcut scenery seems to splinter and break apart as a great flood (the Bible is never far from Pullman’s agnostic mind) rushes across the stage.  Among the speed there is inwardness. The crucial daemons, designed and directed by Barnaby Dixon, are more intimate than spectacular: a lemur coiled round a neck, a snake uncurling across the stage, our hero’s companion shifting (how?) from kingfisher to cat in full view of the audience. Mostly white and mostly small – those belonging to nuns can perch in their wimples – they light up the stage like paper lanterns, though the villain’s nasty snickering hyena flaps on huge and unhinged, like a half-finished craft project. It is an evening of uniformly strong performances. Ella Dacres is bewitching as Alice, graceful, cross and capable. The baddies are persuasively seductive: Ayesha Dharker silky and insinuating – in stilettos that are beginning to look like a shorthand for villainess – and Pip Carter nonchalantly predatory. Crucially, Samuel Creasey makes an astonishing stage debut as the teenage hero: clever and awkward, blurting out his knowledge like a policeman issuing cautions; uningratiating but finally disarming. He is completely truthful: the acting discovery of the year. Days before La Belle Sauvage opened, another puppet-friendly, theologically driven stage adaptation finally reached London. Lolita Chakrabarti’s version of Yann Martel’s Life of Pi, first seen in Sheffield in 2019, had its southward journey delayed by Covid. Now the stalls of Wyndham’s have been especially reconfigured to hold Max Webster’s fine production. Barack Obama congratulated Martel on producing “an elegant proof of God, and the power of storytelling”. The Canadian writer’s tale of life cast away at sea – with beasts and harsh conditions – may be read as fable or fantasy or derring-do tale, but certainly as a celebration of vitality. Early – on both page and stage – is a warning against being sentimental about animals. Stop as soon as you want to cuddle or pat is the message taught to the small boy hero by his zookeeper father, who feeds a much-loved small goat to a Bengal tiger whose name is Richard Parker. The instruction is too spelled out in some clumsy dialogue, but is given force in the puppet animals. These are the marvellous motor of the evening, from the moment Tim Hatley’s plain, bleached set breaks open to show a giraffe rubbernecking through the window of a hospital ward. These creatures – designed by Finn Caldwell with Nick Barnes – have rough edges, an almost provisional look, as if made from driftwood, while seeming infinitely elastic; Caldwell is also the movement director. Manipulated onstage by puppeteers, they move rapidly and fluidly, yet have no soft edges. They are not pets. That adored goat – called Buckingham – is bristling and sprightly; the mighty tiger who kills him ripples along with utter smoothness – somehow conveying an exceptional silence – yet you see also the angular planes of his shoulder blades as he prowls. There is no sweetness, simply accuracy, in the way a rat scuds across a boat and a turtle claws through the waves with cumbersomely arranged limbs. Hiran Abeysekera is the hero and the heart of the action. Quick-eyed, quick-limbed, quick-voiced, he fulfils all the promise he showed in Peter Brook’s The Prisoner three years ago. He is Pi squared. Measure for Measure is a continually startling Shakespeare offering: a play that sends you scurrying to the text to see if a director has added something to underline contemporary relevance. The central encounter – in which Angelo, a temporary ruler and a man of apparently impeccable rectitude, tries to blackmail the novitiate Isabella into bed – has always produced shudders; in a post #MeToo audience it draws gasps: “To whom should I complain? Did I tell this, who would believe me?” Yet at the opening of Blanche McIntyre’s stimulating production, the focus of recognition had shifted again. Angelo has just introduced draconian measures to enforce chastity on his fellow citizens. One rule for him, one for the rest of the country. A disturbing sense of familiarity crept over the stalls. McIntyre has set the play in 1975, regarding this as a time of both social dishevelment and a residual Christian ethos. It’s a switch that gives the evening a cool conviction. The central exchange between Georgia Landers’s full-throated Isabella and Ashley Zhangazha’s laxly entitled Angelo is strong. Unusual doublings-up emphasise the play’s dual morality: Ishia Bennison snarls as a convict and is authoritative as an official. The musical-voiced Eloise Secker is a cool pimp – smoking, handing out her calling card to an audience member – but also plays two of the women who are themselves in effect pimped. Most strikingly, Hattie Ladbury plays the Duke, ambiguous in every way: got up in a headscarf and trenchcoat like a Sloane, but blending easily into her disguise as a priest; commanding, clarion-voiced yet self-doubting. She glides quizzically through a play that begins to look like the Duke’s Dilemma: how did things come to be so unravelled? It is easy to think of the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse as a kind of pomander theatre, sticking any play with its spicy fragrance. In no other space is an audience so warmly enclosed, more swiftly charmed – and as a result more quickly alarmed. In McIntyre’s hands it becomes something different: a structural device rather than an atmospheric enclosure. A working machine. The Duke climbs to the gallery to hide while observing the action beneath. Candelabras are lowered to wrap around a speaker during a soliloquy. Oh – and it’s the 70s: the lighting goes off to signal power cuts.

12/12/2021,"There is no right way to fire someone, but there is a wrong way to fire 900 people. On Wednesday 1 December, Vishal Garg, the chief executive of Better, an American mortgage provider, convened a Zoom meeting of 900 employees. We don’t know what they expected. Perhaps a Christmas quiz. It wasn’t to be. “I come to you with not great news,” Garg began. “I do not want to do this. The last time I did it, I cried. This time I hope to be stronger.” Everyone was rooting for him. “If you’re on this call,” he continued, “you are part of the unlucky group being laid off. Your employment here is terminated, effective immediately.” Merry Christmas. Don’t let the laptop screen hit your hand on the way down.  Garg’s brave message didn’t wash. Employees described the experience as “surreal”. Some found it at odds with Better’s mission statement, which claims “we’re using technology to make [home-ownership] faster and more efficient, and humans to help make it friendly and enjoyable.” Garg was forced to apologise almost at once. “I failed to show the appropriate amount of respect and appreciation for the individuals who were affected and for their contributions to Better,” he said. “I own the decision to do the layoffs but in communicating it I blundered the execution.” Oh well. Third time’s a charm. The main thing is to learn from your mistakes. Garg will know better the next time he has to fire 900 people. Sadly, such a situation is unlikely to arise soon. The apology wasn’t enough. On Friday it was announced that Garg, too, would be taking an extended period of time off, effective immediately. You have to feel for the man. He thought he was doing the honourable thing, especially in light of later reports in which he accused the employees of stealing from the company and only working two hours a day. Firing 900 people online in the privacy of your own company is one thing, but having the story leaked to the media is the kind of thing that could damage a corporate reputation. A mass Zoom sacking is all well and good, but it cannot replicate the intimacy of being sacked by Zoom one on one. But those quick to judge Garg, presumably including the 900 people he fired, should ask themselves how they would have handled it. This ill-conceived event might seem to be evidence we are living in a techno-dystopia, but in fact it is a touching throwback to basic managerial incompetence. It’s not easy, firing 900 people over Zoom. It is difficult enough to look one person in the eye, in person, and tell them their services are no longer needed. The management consultancy industry is based on the fact that only psychopaths enjoy these kinds of difficult conversations. The 2009 film Up in the Air had a comparable premise, which was that if you have to be fired by someone, it might as well be George Clooney. Automation can’t come soon enough. We all like to think that if we found ourselves in such a situation, we would be compassionate and reasonable. Yet whenever technology permits, we embrace laziness and cowardice. Anyone born after 1990 would rather text or email than make a phone call. Why would you speak to someone at the till when the robot checkout is ready and waiting? You might have thought you wanted a flying car, but in reality you crave someone to explain to your husband that he is loading the dishwasher the wrong way. HR is an epicentre of difficult conversations: you’re fired, you’re hired, you’re being rationalised. Technology is rushing to do what humans would rather not, if it’s all the same to you. A sacking robot does not yet exist, but you can bet that engineers are working hard on the prototype. It isn’t only on Zoom, with its possibilities for panopticon whacking, that the changes are being felt. The technology works both ways. If you feel you are being treated like a robot, you are more likely to respond in kind. Applicants to investment banks are learning to hide keywords in the meta-text of their cover letters, to fool the robotic scrapers into giving them an interview. These institutions have also experienced a rush of bisexual applicants: it’s more likely to get you an interview, and it’s hard to disprove. Some interviews are being replaced by robot questioners, with the footage reviewed after the fact. The true purpose of the metaverse is to obviate tricky chats. Soon a robot will post the advertisement, conduct the recruitment process, hire you, manage your grievances and, in time, sack you. You might wonder why you’re still working at all, but the robot will have a charming answer for that, even if Mr Garg doesn’t.",Opinion/Opinion,The mass Zoom sacking proves it: we should leave firing people to robots | Ed Cumming,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/12/the-mass-zoom-sacking-proves-it-we-should-leave-firing-people-to-robots
12/12/2021,"Do years in school make you smarter or do smarter people just stay at school for longer? There’s a strong correlation between our IQ scores and the time we spend in education, so consistent with either possibility. But the implications for education policies are different: if education raises our intelligence we should want more of it than if it just gives us specific skills or knowledge.  Research can help answer this puzzle, using experiments to see if extra schooling really does boost cognitive abilities. A great paper pulls together results from 28 studies that did just that. Some papers show how progress varies by years of education, while others investigated the effect of lengthening compulsory schooling in Norway in the 1960s, via tests on young men entering the military. We consistently see that longer education does raise our cognitive abilities: a person’s IQ gains one to five points for each additional year of education. The evidence also suggests these effects aren’t just flashes in the pan: they last throughout our lives. So yes, you might be born with your brain but it needs training to get to its full potential. The welcome conclusion is that our basic cognitive abilities aren’t set in stone by the luck of birth. The more immediately important one, as Covid-related restrictions return, is that ensuring kids don’t miss out on any more education should be a top priority.
