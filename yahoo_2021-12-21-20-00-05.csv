12/21/2021,"On Anderson Cooper 360 Monday night, John Berman, who was filling in for Cooper, interviewed Dr. Brook Watts, the Chief Medical Officer at the MetroHealth System in Cleveland, Ohio, following the issue of a simple, but powerful, ad in which a group of Ohio hospitals begged for ""help."" ""We're in crisis here in Northeast Ohio,"" said Dr. Watts. ""I think the health systems, together, said it best this weekend, when we took out a joint ad with all hospitals in our region and it said one word. It said 'help.' It said help because our hospitals are filled with patients with COVID and we're struggling."" On Monday, it was also reported that the Omicron variant is now the most dominant strain in the U.S. and, just last week, as Ohio's COVID-19 case count hit its highest point in just over a year, the state deployed its National Guard to hospitals to help with staffing shortages. ""They will be coming into our Cleveland area to help offer access for testing. Right now, because we have so many COVID cases, there isn't a rapid test to be found, and the PCR tests that are offered generally at testing sites, the wait period is approximately seven days. So the National Guard will be helping us by setting up the testing site,"" explained Dr. Watts. With a record-breaking amount of COVID patients in Ohio's hospitals, Dr. Watts also shared that the majority are unvaccinated and, surprisingly, young. ""We continue to see that most of our patients, particularly the patients in the ICUs, are unvaccinated,"" said Dr. Watts. She added, ""I think what felt a little bit, perhaps, different for me this time having taken care of COVID patients since the beginning of the pandemic is I do feel like we are seeing more younger folks. There is nothing more heartbreaking than walking into a COVID patient's room, and seeing pictures of their young children. So, young parents."" While it seems like Dr. Watts might be overwhelmed or scared during this time, she actually just said she feels exhausted. ""Last year, we were in a similar situation but we sure had a lot of hope that we were going to get to a better place. I just don't think any of us saw this coming. For us right now, most of the patients in the hospital still have the Delta variant, but as you mentioned in your intro, Omicron is coming on fast and strong and we are all sort of waiting to see what happens next. And I think that unknown and that fear is contributing to the exhaustion we are all feeling,"" said Dr. Watts. Anderson Cooper 360 airs weeknights at 8 p.m. on CNN. Watch Alabama residents struggling with 'America's dirty secret': Correspondent Bill Whitaker took a deep dive into the lack of sewage treatment affecting residents of Lowndes County, Alabama during Sunday night's episode of 60 Minutes.
Environmental health researcher and White House advisor Catherine Coleman Flowers has been battling this longstanding, and overlooked, public health failure in Lowndes County for 20 years. It is what she calls ""America's dirty secret.""
""If this was a community of more affluent people, this would've made headlines 20 years ago when I first started doing the work,"" said Flowers. ""The reason that the situation has continued for so long is because of the type of benign neglect that has happened to Black communities, poor communities, and rural communities across the United States.""
According to Whitaker, Lowndes County is one of the most neglected corners of the country and the poverty rate is double the national average, which makes sanitary sewage disposal and treatment financially unattainable for the county's residents.
""I have seen things like this in Haiti, and parts of Southeast Asia. I have never seen anything like this in the United States,"" said Whitaker in one resident's backyard.
Whitaker shared that the state of Alabama could not identify how many homes had this problem, so Flowers went door-to-door to find out. After surveying 3,000 homes, Flowers found that two-thirds had failing systems or no systems at all. Even worse, the unsanitary conditions have even had an effect on the residents' health, according to tropical disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine Dr. Rojelio Mejia, who tested the stool and soil from residents' properties.
""Using a PCR test, like those used to detect Covid-19, they found small amounts of DNA from hookworms, a parasite that can cause stomach problems, anemia and developmental delays in children,"" reported Whitaker.
So why has nothing been done? Lowndes County officials have claimed they don't have the money, and the governor and the head of the State Department of Public Health declined to speak with 60 Minutes. However, according to Sherry Bradley, the department is not responsible. Regardless, she has taken it upon herself to start a pilot project on her own.
""I have begged money from a whole lot of people,"" admitted Bradley, who also said she did not know why the state hasn't stepped in to solve the problem.

12/21/2021,"More than 1,000 live streamers have stepped forward to pay back taxes before a year-end deadline. Chinese authorities said in September they were intensifying tax regulation for the entertainment sector. On Monday, top live streamer Viya was slapped with a record $210 million fine for tax evasion. Influencers in China are rushing to pay back taxes amid a government crackdown that has taken down the country's top live streamer. Viya, who is known for hosting a popular shopping stream on the e-commerce platform Taobao, was slapped with a record 1.341 billion Chinese yuan ($210 million) fine for tax evasion. The 36-year-old once had over 120 million followers on various platforms, according to TechNode, and is known for her ability to sell almost anything, including a 40 million Chinese yuan ($6 million) rocket launch service, in 2020. At the beginning of the pandemic, Viya hosted a live stream to raise funds for businesses and individuals struggling in COVID-wracked Wuhan and managed to raise around $32 million within a matter of hours. According to the state-owned China News Service (CNS), more than 1,000 live streamers have stepped forward to pay back taxes following the government's September announcement that it would strengthen its regulation of state revenue collection from the entertainment sector. Taxpayers have until the end of 2021 to rectify their taxes arrears to avoid heavy penalties, according to CNS. Two other high-profile Chinese live streamers — Cherie and Sunny — were fined $15 million collectively in September for tax evasion, but Viya is the most significant star to have fallen so far. Viya apologized for the breach on her Weibo microblog account, which had around 18 million followers, on Monday after news broke, saying she felt ""deeply guilty"" and would ""totally accept"" the punishment meted by the tax authority, according to a copy of the notice Insider saw. She also pledged to pay the fine on time. But despite the apology, Weibo (China's version of Twitter), Douyin (China's version of TikTok), and Taobao took her accounts offline. Beijing is intensifying oversight of the entertainment industry and regulating what celebrities can do. China's internet regulator said in November that celebrities in China must avoid flaunting their wealth and adhere to ""core socialist values."" In November, China also revealed a blacklist which included the names of 88 celebrities it had cited for ""illegal and unethical"" behavior.
