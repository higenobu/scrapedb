3/19/2022,"China is by far the world’s biggest COVID powder keg — and it might be on the verge of exploding. Not since the earliest days of the pandemic has the most populous country on the planet ever reported more than about 200 coronavirus cases per day — dizzying evidence of the blunt, even brutal, effectiveness of Beijing’s “zero COVID” strategy, which requires strict mass lockdowns at the first flicker of an outbreak. For most of the last two years, mainland China has averaged fewer than 50 cases per day. According to official numbers, no one — not one of China’s 1.4 billion residents — has died of COVID since May 16, 2020. While the virus ravaged the rest of the globe, China claimed it had basically vanished from its country of origin. But now, tragically, that appears to be changing. Over the last few weeks, China’s COVID curve has shot straight up — the telltale sign of an Omicron outbreak. Nationwide, new daily cases cleared 5,100 for the first time ever on Monday; even in February 2020, when the virus first skyrocketed in Wuhan, that number officially peaked at just 3,300 per day, on average. It’s entirely possible, in other words, that Omicron — and its BA.2 subvariant, which is at least 30 percent more transmissible and appears to account for the bulk of new infections — has already triggered China’s worst outbreak to date. So far, at least 28 of the country’s 31 provinces and regions — including major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen — have reported new infections. In response, Beijing has followed its usual playbook. According to CNN, “five cities — collectively home to more than 37 million residents — are now under varying levels of lockdown,” with locals forced to remain in their homes or neighborhoods as schools, businesses, factories and public transport close and authorities conduct multiple rounds of compulsory mass testing. Two mayors in northeastern China have been dismissed; even Shanghai has shuttered its school system and shifted to online instruction. As Lei Zhenglong, deputy head of the National Health Commission’s Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency published on Wednesday, “Our prevention and control measures” must “be earlier, faster, stricter and more effective” because of how quickly and easily Omicron spreads. But the question now is how long can this go on? Handled properly, a zero COVID approach can pay off. Until late last year, New Zealand essentially had eradicated the virus by closing its borders, targeting lockdowns and aggressively testing, tracing and isolating every infection it detected. Today, just 156 New Zealanders have died from the disease — total. And the country has lifted nearly all restrictions. Yet there’s a reason New Zealand’s policy worked: It was just as aggressive about vaccinating its people as eliminating the virus. So far more than 95% of New Zealanders over 12 have been vaccinated; more importantly, nearly 100% of elderly New Zealanders — by far the most vulnerable group — have received two or more vaccine doses. By the time the country stopped trying to eliminate the virus — after the ever-more-contagious Delta and Omicron variants made it pretty much impossible — nearly every resident at risk of severe illness or death already had the antibodies they needed to ward off the worst outcomes. Hong Kong, however, has been a different story. The city also went with a zero COVID approach; until Omicron, it never recorded more than a handful of cases each day. Yet when Omicron finally hit, it hit hard, propelling new cases from about 100 per day on Feb. 4 to a high of more than 44,000 one month later. The problem was that due to hesitancy, misinformation and a lack of official urgency, a staggering 66% of residents over the age of 80 were still unvaccinated at the time — and most of those who were vaccinated had received China’s non-mRNA Sinovac vaccine, which is significantly less effective against Omicron infection. As a result, 1 in 4 cases reported in Hong Kong are now resulting in death; more than 4,500 residents have succumbed to the virus in the last month alone. That’s by far the worst death rate in the world — an unthinkable toll two years into the pandemic. The risk for China — where the Sinovac vaccine is standard, where more than 50 million people over 60 are not fully vaccinated and where at least 15 million people over 80 are not vaccinated at all — is that it’s about to become the next Hong Kong. Yet even if that doesn’t happen — even if Beijing’s more authoritarian “prevention and control measures” do turn out to “be earlier, faster, stricter and more effective” than ever before — major risks remain. For one thing, reporting out of China suggests that people are losing patience with draconian lockdowns. “I really broke down tonight and have never wanted to leave Shenzhen as much as I do tonight. Since I opened my shop on March 1, I haven’t made a single penny,” a comment made in response to a post on WeChat by the Shenzhen Health Commission read, according to the Washington Post. The Communist Party government is starting to acknowledge the downside of such draconian restrictions as well, especially as they hinder major auto and tech suppliers and as China’s economy slows. On Thursday, President Xi Jinping urged the Politburo Standing Committee, the Chinese Communist Party’s top decision-making body, to “strive to achieve the greatest prevention and control effect with the smallest cost, and minimize the impact of the pandemic on economic and social development,” according to the official Xinhua news agency. Yet China also revised its pandemic guidelines this week to include the use of Paxlovid, the highly effective antiviral pills made by Pfizer — a sign that it may lack confidence in its current immunity levels to prevent mass death from Omicron. Until Chinese residents can receive mRNA boosters, it’s unlikely that Beijing will follow New Zealand’s path out of the pandemic, and the same story — outbreak, lockdown, outbreak, lockdown — will keep playing out over and over again. And that, in turn, leaves the rest of the world at risk. When China first launched its zero COVID plan, experts thought the virus might peter out someday. Now they predict it will circulate forever, and they warn that whatever versions come after Omicron and BA.2 won’t necessarily be “milder.” The more people in places like China who remain unvaccinated or undervaccinated, the more chances the virus has to evolve. “We haven’t even seen a new, major variant yet, but there are too many reasons to believe that is likely in the months ahead,” Dr. Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, wrote Wednesday in the Guardian. “Add to all this is what is happening in China, which has fully relied on a zero-Covid policy, resulting in very little natural immunity, and vaccines that have weak efficacy against Omicron. Now this country is facing major outbreaks in two of its most populous cities, Shanghai and Shenzhen, and undoubtedly the whole country will be affected. We learned in 2019 that what happens in China doesn’t stay in China.”",World/Yahoo News,How China's soaring COVID numbers put the rest of the world at risk,https://news.yahoo.com/how-chinas-soaring-covid-numbers-put-the-rest-of-the-world-at-risk-124959071.html
3/19/2022,"Russia's former foreign minister has dismissed the chances of nuclear war, declaring the prospect an ""empty threat"" from Vladimir Putin. Andrei Kozyrev, who served under Putin's predecessor Boris Yeltsin, also suggested the Putin era will soon end in ""disaster"" amid the Ukraine crisis. Putin ramped up his aggression three weeks ago when he put Russia's nuclear forces on high alert following the West's so-called ""unfriendly"" response following his invasion. At the very least, it raised the prospect that he was considering the use of a nuclear weapon, though experts dismissed this as rhetoric. And Kozyrev, speaking to The Economic Asks podcast, said he agreed. ""No it's just a blackmail,"" he said of the nuclear threat. Russia is believed to have 4,477 nuclear warheads. It is one of nine countries which has nuclear weapon capacities. Of the other eight, three are Nato allies - the US, France and the UK - among which there are 5,943 nuclear warheads. Kozyrev continued: ""Those forces which he allegedly ordered... sources are openly saying they don't see anything like that. It's an empty threat but he plays this game. Watch: Russia making ‘no real progress’ - UK government ""Those strategic weapons that he ordered on alert [are] suicidal weapons because if he sends a missile to Europe, Nato or the United States, he gets two back and there is no survival for anyone."" Asked how Putin's dictatorship ends, Kozyrev stated: ""In disaster. It's already disaster but he just does not realise that."" He added a coup is possible, saying it is ""very much in Russian tradition"".

More pertinently, his war has caused a humanitarian disaster, with hundreds of civilian deaths and millions of people displaced from their homes. Kozyrev added he expects Putin to attempt ""negotiating a way out"" if it becomes clear he can't win and starts to face growing resistance among Russians.",World/Yahoo News UK,"Putin's dictatorship will end in disaster, says former Russian minister",https://news.yahoo.com/putin-russia-regime-nuclear-war-ukraine-invasion-140942740.html
3/19/2022,"A married couple in Georgia was arrested last week in connection to the Capitol riot. Charles Hand III and Mandy Robinson-Hand face four counts each. Prosecutors say both made Facebook posts documenting their experience in the aftermath of the attack. A married couple from Georgia was arrested and charged in connection to the January 6 Capitol Riot last week after a trove of Facebook posts, security footage, and anonymous tips led FBI agents to their door. Charles Hand III and Mandy Robinson-Hand, of Butler, Georgia, are each charged with four counts connected with their alleged role in the insurrection, including entering and remaining in a restricted building, disorderly and disruptive conduct, and parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building. Their Friday arrests come more than 14 months after a mob of pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election. Prosecutors said the couple was captured on security footage throughout the US Capitol on January 6, identifiable by Charles Hand's red University of Georgia baseball hat. The Hands also appeared in open source documentary footage from that day, according to court documents. An anonymous witness who knows the couple from Georgia later identified the Hands in screenshots from surveillance footage inside the Capitol, prosecutors said. Documentary footage from the scene reportedly shows Charles Hand breaking off a piece of metal fencing from outside the Capitol and putting in his back pocket around 1:00 pm. Security footage later caught the couple entering the building through a breached doorway at approximately 2:30 p.m. local, according to court records. At one point, law enforcement officers appeared to be involved in a physical altercation inside the building, prosecutors said, citing security camera footage. Charles Hand appeared to try and make his way toward the conflict, but his wife restrained him, court documents show. Following the insurrection, both Charles Hand and Mandy Robinson-Hand documented their experiences in multiple Facebook posts. Prosecutors said Charles Hand described witnessing ""thousands upon thousands of angry Americans marching onto the Capitol to protest and stop the certification of what I personally believe to be an election stolen from the American people."" Meanwhile, a tipster told investigators that Mandy Robinson-Hand wrote her own posts, in which she said, ""We're in the capital [sic]. Taking our house back,"" and ""We've been tear gassed etc."" Prosecutors said the posts have since been deleted. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Tuesday reported that Mandy Robinson-Hand is a local Republican Party official, serving as the chairwoman of the Taylor County Republican Party. Robinson-Hand did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment on her and her husband's behalf. More than 750 people have been arrested so far in connection with the attack, and more than 200 have pleaded guilty.

3/19/2022,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will meet with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, to strengthen their partnership in the Indo-Pacific and beyond in view of China’s growing footprint in the region, an Indian official said Thursday. The meeting on Saturday will provide an opportunity to exchange views on regional and global issues of mutual interest, said Arindam Bagchi, India’s External Affairs Ministry spokesman. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the relationship with China are expected to figure prominently in their discussions. Kishida will be in India over the weekend, he said. Japan has announced comprehensive financial sanctions to isolate Russia, including export controls on semiconductors and other high-tech products. But India has refrained from taking sides in the conflict and abstained from voting against Russia at the U.N. or criticizing President Vladimir Putin. India says ties with Japan are key to stability in the Indo-Pacific region. The two nations, along with the United States and Australia, are members of the Indo-Pacific alliance known as “the Quad” that is grappling with a rising China's coercive economic practices and military maneuvering. In September, the Quad leaders announced Japan would work with India on a $100 million investment in COVID-19 vaccines and treatment drugs. The bilateral trade between India and Japan for 2019-20 crossed $11.87 billion. India’s exports from Japan amounted to $3.94 billion while India’s imports from Japan stood at $7.93 billion. India’s main exports have been petroleum products, chemicals, fish, clothing, iron and steel products, textile yarn, fabrics and machinery. India’s imports from Japan include electrical machinery, iron and steel products, plastic materials, parts of motor vehicles, organic chemicals and metals, according to India's External Affairs Ministry. The Japanese investments in India touched $32 billion between 2000 and 2019, mainly in the automobile, electrical equipment, telecommunications, chemical, insurance and pharmaceutical sectors.",World/Associated Press,Japanese PM to visit India to build Indo-Pacific partnership,https://news.yahoo.com/japanese-pm-visit-india-build-131012807.html
