4/27/2022,"Liverpool’s first European encounter with a team led by Unai Emery made a miserable impression on Jordan Henderson, yet Jürgen Klopp’s reaction to that defeat by Sevilla in the 2016 Europa League final would leave a lasting one. It was, the Liverpool captain reflects, the start of the stunning chapter that could include a third Champions League final appearance in five seasons in Paris next month. Emery’s Villarreal stand in the way of that ambition at Anfield on Wednesday and at the 23,500-capacity El Madrigal stadium next Tuesday. It was Marcelino’s Villarreal in the 2016 Europa League semi-finals and, after Liverpool’s 3-1 aggregate victory, Emery’s Sevilla denied Klopp a European trophy and passage into the Champions League at the end of his debut season at Anfield. As Sevilla celebrated a third successive triumph in the competition under Emery, Liverpool retreated to the Novotel Basel City hotel to lick the wounds of a 3-1 defeat. Henderson, an unused substitute at St Jakob Park after sustaining a serious knee injury in the quarter-final at Borussia Dortmund, wanted to be alone. Klopp had other ideas. “That night always sticks out,” the midfielder recalled on Tuesday. “Because I remember after the game going back to the hotel and the lads were all very disappointed and just wanted to go back to their room, not see anyone and get their heads down. But the gaffer was different to what you expect. He got everyone together downstairs in the bar area and we all spent the night together. It felt as though he knew this was the beginning, the start of something special to come. As a player it is very difficult to think like that then when you’ve just lost a final but I always felt he was very different to anything I’d seen before. “That night always sticks out in my mind: he sort of knew what was coming in the next few years. He has produced that and proven that was the beginning of something special.” Klopp, who has won all three of his European semi-finals as Liverpool manager, claims he was not as certain about the success that lay ahead as it may have seemed in the Novotel bar. “I said that night that we would come back, but without knowing we would come back! But at that moment I really thought we had a chance to come back stronger, and we did,” he said. “That night was a tough one to take; we had a really good first half, should have scored more. But it was game number 64 in the season, an incredibly tough season, a lot of injury problems, players only came back a few days before the final. Would anything have been different since then had we won that night? I don’t think so. I would have loved it if we lifted the trophy that night but you have to try and learn from these things.” Henderson believed Liverpool were on to something special the moment Klopp arrived at Anfield in October 2015, although it was the confidence the manager projected after defeat in Basel that made a difference. “As soon as the manager came in he gave a lift to the whole club, the team, everybody really, but it is difficult when you lose a European final because you are so focused on that night because you have been so close,” Henderson said. “I think the manager had a very good way of seeing the bigger picture and using that experience to our benefit going forward. His mentality was different, I felt he knew it was the start, and that confidence transcends to the players. It’s been pretty eventful since then so hopefully we can carry on going on in the right way. Tomorrow is a big night to continue going in the right direction.” The Europa League final represents Emery’s only win in five meetings with Liverpool – he drew once and lost three times while in charge of Arsenal – but his Villarreal team have won four of their past five away matches in European competition and have overcome Bayern Munich and Juventus en route to the semi-final. “Unai has a plan for each result,” said Klopp. “Whether you are 0-0, 1-0 up, 1-0 down, more possession, less possession. Even if they are not winning, they are close. That is really impressive and we need exactly that too, a plan for each possible result. First go for it, then deal with it. We need the atmosphere, we need the performance. We need a big game. We need to be on top of our game, I need to be on top of my game. “It is the semi-final of the Champions League. If it was easy then something would be completely wrong. I can’t wait, even in this tactics schedule, with this kind of week – City, United, Everton – if you need a next game to be 1,000% in then, yes, bring on Villarreal in the semi final of the Champions League.”",Sport/Football,"Henderson, Emery and night in a bar that launched Klopp’s new Liverpool",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/26/henderson-emery-and-night-in-a-bar-that-launched-klopps-new-liverpool
4/27/2022,"Boris Johnson is pushing to cut the cost of childcare by allowing nurseries in England to take in more toddlers without employing extra staff, as part of plans to relax health and safety rules to ease the cost of living. At a cabinet brainstorming session on reducing living costs, Johnson was on board with the idea of reviewing nursery ratios of staff per child, while Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, suggested pushing MOTs to once every two years, rather than one. Other ideas floated included scrapping tariffs for food imports, and scrapping net zero commitments. According to one source, Johnson asked to speed up a review of childcare costs, which has been looking at how many children each adult can supervise. A cabinet source said Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, was looking at bringing England more into line with Scotland, which has looser ratios for two-year-olds. At the moment, both England and Scotland allow one adult per three children under two, but differ for children aged two, with England saying one adult per four children and Scotland permitting one adult per five children. For children aged three or over, England allows qualified staff to look after 13 children each, and unqualified staff to look after eight children. In Scotland, the rules are one adult per eight children aged three to eight, and one adult per 10 children for those aged eight plus. At the same meeting, Shapps raised the idea of relaxing MOT rules that govern the roadworthiness of vehicles. He suggested allowing the safety checks every two years rather than every year in a bid to save motorists’ money, after there was previously an extension of six months during the pandemic. The meeting was held after Johnson called on his cabinet to think of ways of reducing the cost of living crisis – just weeks after Rishi Sunak’s spring statement, which was criticised over its lack of help for families. However, they were warned that there would be no extra money and asked to come up with “non-fiscal” solutions. Sunak “underlined the importance of not feeding in to further inflation rises and emphasised that the UK is currently spending £80bn servicing our debt”, No 10 said. The prime minister will look at the options when he chairs a “domestic and economic strategy committee” in the coming weeks. Both Labour and the Lib Dems accused the government of planning to compromise child safety. Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said: “The Conservatives are making high quality childcare increasingly unavailable and unaffordable … Now the government’s solution is to drive down quality whilst making no difference to availability.” Munira Wilson, the Lib Dem education spokesperson added: “Boris Johnson’s new plan is not to address this issue head on, but instead to cut corners and endanger our children. Their safety should be our number one priority, not be reduced to a cost-cutting measure.” It also comes as the cabinet is facing splits over No 10 and Jacob Rees-Mogg’s approach to trying to force civil servants back into the office. At least two cabinet ministers are known to be sceptical of Rees-Mogg’s confrontational approach of leaving notes on civil servants’ desks when they are seen to be not in the office, in addition to Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, who said the move was “Dickensian”. The lack of enthusiasm for Rees-Mogg’s crusade to get civil servants back to “pre-pandemic working” is also evident at ministerial level. One senior minister and usual Johnson loyalist said No 10’s combative attitude towards the civil service made no sense, saying: “Don’t pick a fight with the civil service as they will find a way to fuck you over.” They said their department was committed to trusting civil servants to find a balance and work flexibly. One cabinet source said the “finger-wagging” approach was not as successful as setting clear flexible working guidance, while another said their department’s tactics were “encouragement” and an “upbeat approach”. The Guardian reported on Monday that Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, and at least four permanent secretaries are among those who have raised concerns about Rees-Mogg’s approach.",News/Business,Boris Johnson pushes to relax health and safety rules to ease cost of living,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/26/boris-johnson-pushes-to-relax-health-and-safety-rules-to-ease-cost-of-living
4/27/2022,"A man who was being questioned for the kidnap of a missing 33-year-old woman from Lancashire has now been arrested for murder, after police said they only have a “slim hope” that she is alive. Katie Kenyon, from Padiham, was seen leaving an address in Todmorden Road, Burnley, on Friday morning. A woman matching her description was seen with a man and travelling in a silver Ford Transit. More than 60 specialist search officers from four police forces are in the process of scouring a rural beauty spot in Lancashire. A 50-year-old man from Burnley, who was being questioned on suspicion of kidnap, was further arrested on suspicion of murder on Tuesday. Detectives are expected to ask magistrates for more time to question the suspect who is understood to be known to Kenyon. DS Gary Brooks, Lancashire police’s head of major crime, said: “While I hold some slim hope that Katie may still be found alive I’m sad to say that Katie has now been missing for over four days. “Despite extensive police enquiries and media appeals we have not found Katie nor have there been any sightings of Katie. “We have spoken to Katie’s family today and they are understandably extremely upset by this latest development and I have officers continuing to offer them support.

4/27/2022,"A woman who became pregnant during an affair with a married senior civil servant told a court he looked “very flustered” before preparing a drink for her allegedly spiked with an abortion drug. Darren Burke, 43, a deputy director for the emergency services mobile communications programme at the Home Office, is accused of trying to cause Laura Slade’s miscarriage. She refused to drink a glass of orange juice, allegedly laced with mifepristone – a medication used to induce an abortion, on 4 December 2020, but had an unconnected miscarriage weeks later, Isleworth crown court was told. Burke, from Windsor, denies obtaining the drug with intent and attempting to administer it to procure a miscarriage. Jurors heard he encouraged her to terminate the pregnancy and sent her links to an abortion clinic and abortion pill after she fell pregnant during the course of their five-year affair. Giving evidence from behind a screen, Slade said: “It was never really an option for me but I knew I had to consider everyone else around me and the impact it would have on them.” She said she was “very clear” that she did not want an abortion adding: “I told him when the due date was and that I was keeping my child.” Messages between her and Burke were shown to the court in which she said: “You’ve yelled at me, force(d) me to call an abortion clinic, told me how this will destroy your loved ones repetitively, you offered to hold my hand at the abortion clinic, you have crushed my heart.” She said she had “an instant gut feeling something was not right” when, on 3 December 2020, Burke offered to get her a Starbucks latte or tea the following morning, though he had never previously brought her a hot drink. Slade said she had told him she was suffering from morning sickness before he arrived at her flat in Chiswick, west London, on 4 December . “He was very flustered, walking between the front room and the kitchen and was offering me a drink again,” she said. The court heard Burke returned with two glasses – one which looked like orange juice and the other water – while he had a cup of tea or coffee. Slade continued: “I just looked at it and looked at him and said: ‘Well I’m not drinking that. I’ve told you I’ve got morning sickness.”’ She said she got upset when he told her he did not want to be on the baby’s birth certificate and asked him to leave. The court heard he asked of the orange juice: “Are you going to drink that?” She said she told him: “Fuck no.” She continued: “He then picked it up and took it into the kitchen with his cup, then came back.” After he left, Slade said, she found a white powder on the empty glass and called police to report her suspicions the following day. David Spens QC, defending, suggested Burke was not “insisting” Slade drink the orange juice but had simply asked her twice because he was being “caring”. The barrister asked: “Did he explain that he had brought the abortion tablets with him and when it was obvious you were determined to keep the baby he then ground them up and flushed them down the sink?” Slade replied: “No, I disagree.” The trial continues.",News/UK news,Married civil servant accused of lacing lover’s drink with anti-abortion drug,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/26/married-civil-servant-accused-of-lacing-mistresss-drink-with-anti-abortion-drug
4/27/2022,"An expert in intimate partner violence called to give evidence in Johnny Depp’s defamation lawsuit against Amber Heard has testified that her evaluation of the female actor revealed two psychiatric diagnoses – borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder. Depp’s witness, Shannon Curry, said that the diagnosis came from examination of Heard’s previous psychological assessments, coupled with direct examination on two occasions, and participation in a Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) test, a court in Alexandria, Virginia, heard on Tuesday. Curry said that Heard, 36, displayed a “reactive”, “overly dramatic presentation” and used words like “magical” and “wonderful” to describe events. Heard, she said, flitted between “princess and victim”. As sophisticated, “cute and girlish” as such people may present, Curry said, they “may in reality be very destructive”, “dramatic, erratic and unpredictable” and possessed of an “underlying drive to not be abandoned but also to be center of attention”. Curry said borderline personality disorder represented an unstable personality, alert to rejection, with little access to self-regulation and marked by “a lot of anger, cruelty toward people less powerful, concerned with image, attention seeking and prone to externalizing blame, a lot suppressed anger that may explode outwards”. Anyone attempting an intimate relationship with such a personality, Curry said, would likely go from “idolized to dumpster”. It was typical of borderline personalities, she added, to be “assaultive as partners. They’ll make threats using the legal system, threaten to file for a restraining order, claim abuse.” The testimony on the forensic psychological evaluation of Heard – which the defendant would have to have agreed to have aired in court – came during the ninth day of the trial in which Depp is suing his former wife for defamation after she wrote an article describing herself as a survivor of domestic abuse during their marriage. Depp, 58, claims Heard abused him. The court has been presented with witnesses’ recollection of the couple’s disputes and investigated for their observations of the relationship dynamics that underpinned them, as each side attempts to establish for the jury the probability of their version of events. Earlier on Tuesday, Tara Roberts, the manager of Depp’s residence on an island in the Exuma chain of the Bahamas, testified that she witnessed a dispute between the couple during which “Amber was telling him he was a washed-up actor going to die a fat, lonely old man”. Moments later, as Depp attempted to leave, Heard was observed “hugging and kissing” the actor as his wife “begged him to return”. Roberts said Depp “stood there with his arms by his side. He didn’t do anything.” She later noticed that Depp had a “mark across the bridge of his nose”, she said. The housekeeper disputed she had ever seen Depp “passed out drunk” but acknowledged he had once fallen out of a hammock and had been found lying beneath it. After that incident, Roberts said, she arranged for Heard and Depp’s two children, Lily Rose and Jack, to leave the island. Throughout the trial, jurors have heard from a number of medical and mental health professionals.

4/27/2022,"What with one thing and another, Boris Johnson has spent more time anxiously looking out for both the police and his own rattled backbenchers in recent weeks than he has for the country. But with the local elections taking place next week, it has suddenly dawned on him that almost everyone is worried about the cost-of-living crisis. So at this week’s cabinet meeting, The Convict was determined to give the subject his undivided attention. There was just one problem. There was no spare money, no tax cuts even, to help those who were struggling to heat their homes and put food on the table. Which meant that the cabinet was more like a money saving expert away-day, with each minister chipping in with a few tips on how to get the best value for your money. Johnson got the ball rolling. If you were struggling to pay your bills, then you could always get Lord Brownlow to pay them. It had worked a treat for him. Brownlow had stumped up a fortune for the hideous wallpaper and wouldn’t be averse to helping out a few others. The Convict was on a roll. How about some government adverts reminding people that they got a 50% reduction on their fixed-penalty notices if they were paid within 28 days of being issued? Or better still, just send any fines to the editor of GQ. That had saved him the best part of £4K when he had been the motoring correspondent for the magazine. Not that he had actually bothered to drive any of the cars he had been asked to review. There was another money-saving tip. Cheat your employers whenever possible. Next up was Rishi Sunak. He appeared understandably reluctant to get involved but soon got into the swing. People could save thousands of pounds a year by choosing to file their tax returns in Mauritius. He had no idea why so many people had been so slow to take advantage of that loophole. And then there were huge savings to be had by combining a home gym and stable block into one building. He owed his architect for that suggestion. Nadhim Zahawi nodded. The heating for his stables was costing a fortune now he could no longer charge them to expenses. Those were the days. Grant Shapps was desperate not to be left out. First up he proposed to offer a whole load of cheap railway tickets that were not actually valid for any journeys. So no one would actually be spending money on going anywhere. Brilliant. But the Shappster wasn’t done. How about people drove 20 miles to a cheaper garage to save 1p per litre on petrol? “That’s amazing,” said The Convict. “I can’t believe I didn’t think of that. Why don’t you go on Times Radio and make that idiotic suggestion?” So he did. “Anything from you Prittster?” Priti Patel smirked. She had the ace up her sleeve. The killer line. Anyone who was looking to go on holiday to Rwanda could save themselves the price of the air fare by hanging around on a Kent beach with a rubber dinghy until the police rounded them up. Johnson was so thrilled by the cabinet brains trust, if you can call it that, trust – the Tories were now nailed on to do well in the elections – that he was unable to turn up in person in the Commons to answer an urgent question from SNP leader, Ian Blackford, on why he hadn’t bothered to update the Commons on his India trip. Though judging by the heckling and jeering from the opposition benches when they realised that junior Foreign Office minister Vicky Ford had been sent out in Johnson’s place, most had reached the safe conclusion that the real reason The Convict had gone awol for a few days was that he was running scared of parliament. The man who claims to love democracy will do anything to avoid answering to MPs. “I thought everyone was trying to be a bit nicer to women,” said a rather tetchy Ford. Though she might have done better to direct that observation to the prime minister, whose own cowardice had left her to be hung out to dry. As so often, Johnson was only too happy to let someone junior take the flak for him. Maybe Ford had imagined there would be some thanks, some glory, out of drawing the short straw. That’s not Big Dog’s style. He just uses people and discards them. He’ll find out how few friends he really has when the Tories finally get round to replacing him. It soon turned out that Ford knew absolutely nothing about India – why should she? Her Foreign Office brief is for Africa – and even less about what the prime minister had done on his trip to Gujarat and New Delhi as she hadn’t been there with him and no one had bothered to brief her. So after MPs had finished goading her for protecting The Convict, they started to ask her detailed questions to which she had no worthwhile answers. “Um,” she said, trying to conceal her embarrassment. She was sure it must have been a worthwhile trip because otherwise Johnson wouldn’t have gone. How little she knows him. And there must have been some kind of discussion about India’s lukewarm support for Ukraine and Narendra Modi’s persecution of minorities. Even if it was a discussion not to discuss it. “Britain really cares about human rights abuses,” she repeated sadly. And no one had briefed her how to answer why a trade deal with India would never come close to replacing the trade lost through Brexit. So she didn’t bother. It wasn’t pretty. And it certainly wasn’t clever. This was Ford’s second punishment beating of the morning. She had also had to take on Rwanda at Foreign Office questions. She was the picture of discomfort as she tried to claim her department wasn’t at all bothered about Rwanda’s record on human rights after all. Everything was just fine. Asylum seekers would be really happy. Even Ford didn’t look as if she believed that. But when your luck’s out, your luck’s out.",News/Politics,PM dodges MPs again as junior minister takes the flak | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/26/pm-dodges-mps-again-as-junior-minister-takes-the-flak
4/27/2022,"Labour chiefs have warned the party it is unlikely to be able to spin a compelling story of victory after next week’s local elections, calling Tory claims of 750 losses “ludicrous” and suggesting Labour may even lose “red wall” seats. Shadow cabinet ministers warned the party was on “thin ice” when it came to its poll lead. This week the shadow levelling up secretary, Lisa Nandy, warned the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, that the party needed to switch its focus from attacking the prime minister over Partygate, to talking about the cost of living crisis. Following Nandy’s warning, the Labour leader said on Tuesday that he had made the crisis a focus throughout the local elections. Starmer told reporters in Stevenage: “When we started the campaign, we had a laser-like focus on the cost of living and we’ve maintained that throughout.” Labour aides are preparing a post-election narrative which would compare the party’s rise in vote share to a read-across on how many constituency seats the party could gain. The current electoral cycle is usually the most favourable for Labour, which already holds 50% of the seats up for election. In practice, this will mean it is harder to announce significant seat gains. “This is going to be a very random set of elections where the story of the night is not immediately clear,” one senior Labour source said. “There will be some areas, including in seats we lost in 2019, where it will be clear we have far more work to do.” Ward-by-ward, vote share will be watched to see how it may translate into seat gains in Westminster. Those under close observation include Bury, where all seats are up for election and where Tories were elected by narrow margins – though one MP, Christian Wakeford, defected to Labour in January. Birmingham Northfield is another area where Labour is hoping to be able to spin a gain. Party chiefs are privately dismissive of taking London councils such as Westminster and Wandsworth, but are hopeful of making progress in Barnet. Gains there would allow Starmer to tell a story about how the party has responded to the antisemitism crisis, viewed as a key factor in the party’s underperformance in the north-west London council under previous leader Jeremy Corbyn in 2018. Though most of the parliamentary Labour party have been heartened by Starmer’s progress as the Tories struggled with scandals, doubts remain about the leader’s boldness, even on the shadow frontbench. “There are plenty of people who were whispering loudly about Keir after conference. It doesn’t take a lot to get people in the Labour party into a panic,” one shadow minister said. “By and large, I think we’re on the right track, but it will be easy for Tories to grab the narrative after 5 May and I hope that doesn’t send us into a tailspin.” Another shadow minister said the poll lead was “built on sand” and that Starmer had to prove he could take it up a gear on more than just sleaze scandals. “The caution is infuriating. The material is dry. The policies are scattergun. I do think we need to start making a bigger impression on a much broader range of stories,” they said. “I think it was particularly bad around conference when there was chaos on the forecourts, and yet everyone stuck to their prepared speeches. It’s better now there are better frontbenchers, but I am not yet seeing a sign that there is a big enough shift in the comms operation.” Even though Starmer has shored up his position with MPs, the former shadow cabinet minister, Barry Gardiner, has been approached by colleagues about whether he may be a future unity candidate. “The left don’t actually have anyone themselves. I’m not sure Richard Burgon would even make it to the ballot,” one backbencher said. Starmer’s position of non-compromise with the left is seen by most of his backers as an electoral asset, but there are worries from some senior MPs that it could backfire should Labour form a minority government in the future, leaving them dependent on iron party discipline. One shadow cabinet minister said they felt Starmer should be spending more time on hammering home the cost of living crisis, and less time “fighting the battles of the past”.",News/Politics,"Labour on ‘thin ice’ at local elections despite poll lead, warn party chiefs",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/26/labour-on-thin-ice-at-local-elections-despite-poll-lead-warn-party-chiefs
4/27/2022,"Poland’s government has been told that the country’s gas supply from Russia will stop from Wednesday following Warsaw’s refusal to pay its supplier, Gazprom, in roubles, in an apparent warning shot to the rest of Europe. The decision to kill supply at 8am CET had also followed Poland’s announcement earlier on Tuesday that it was imposing sanctions on 50 entities and individuals –including Russia’s biggest gas company – over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The move will be a grave concern to those countries who are the most heavily dependent on Russian gas, such as Germany, but at a hastily arranged press conference, Polish ministers said they had sufficient supplies to weather an interruption while accusing Gazprom of a breach of contract. Anna Moskwa, minister for climate, said: “There are no worries about shortages gas in our homes. It is worth pointing out that liquified nature gas alone supplies the market sufficiently. LNG deliveries in [terminal] Świnoujście are growing – in 2015 there was one, in 2021 it was already 35. As of today, it provides for about 50 deliveries.” She added: “Appropriate diversification strategies that we have introduced allow us to feel on the safe side in this situation.” PGNiG, Poland’s largest gas supplier, said it would file a breach of contract lawsuit over Gazprom’s decision. Russia currently supplies about 55% of Poland’s annual demand of about 21bn cubic meters of gas but the country’s government has still been pushing the EU and other western allies to go further in punishing the Kremlin. The NGO Europe Beyond Coal has calculated that the EU has sent more than €41bn (£34.7bn) to Russia in payments for fossil fuels since it invaded Ukraine two months ago. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, had already said he intended to ban Russian gas and oil imports by the end of the year and there has been a move to diversify to cover for losses. The key Yamal pipeline carries natural gas from Russia to Poland and Germany, through Belarus. But the Polish government had made a clear move away from dependency by constructing a liquefied natural gas terminal in the Baltic port of Świnoujście run by Qatari and US companies, which is capable of handling 5bn bcm of gas. It is being expanded to 7.5bcm by 2023. The extent to which Polish industry will be able to rely on this flow is yet to be seen, however, and other countries will be worried about the development. Moscow had warned clients in March that they risked having their gas supplies cut unless they paid in roubles. The European Commission had nevertheless said companies should continue to pay Gazprom in the currency agreed in their contracts, about 97% of which are in euros or dollars. The only EU leader who has suggested he would pay Gazprom in roubles is Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, whose right wing government has pursued a close relationship with Putin’s regime for over a decade. The move by the Kremlin comes as EU member states are drawing up a six wave of sanctions that could include imposing a ceiling on the price paid for Russian oil. But there remains a reluctance in Berlin, in particular, to go hard on gas imports given the German economies dependence on Russia in that field. In early April, Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz told the Bundestag that the country’s energy reliance had “grown over decades and cannot be ended from one day to the next” given that it would lead to the rationing of energy to industry and the potential closure of its largest factories. On Tuesday, Gazprom denied that gas flows to Poland had been stopped. Spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said: “Today Poland has to pay for gas supplies according to the new payment procedure.”",News/World news,"Russia to halt gas supply to Poland, government told",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/russia-to-halt-gas-supply-to-poland-government-told
4/27/2022,"For anyone harbouring doubts about the scale of the challenge involved in trying to make the internet safer, above all for children, a new Channel 4 Dispatches programme on the metaverse is likely to dispel them. The presenter, Yinka Bokinni, introduces herself as a “tech lover” before donning an Oculus headset and heading off into the network of 3D virtual worlds that Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg describes as the internet’s “next frontier”. What she finds there leaves her visibly shaken. Sexual harassment, rape threats and racist epithets are ubiquitous, and childhood offers little protection (one of the avatars she adopts is 13). Even paedophilia is freely admitted to. Back in the real world, the UK government’s online safety bill is moving closer to becoming law. It had its second reading in the House of Commons this month and has a broad base of support, although Labour is likely to try to amend provisions that grant powers to the secretary of state that should stay with the regulator, Ofcom. Meanwhile in Brussels, an agreement bringing closer the enactment of a Digital Services Act was reached at the weekend. It will ban some kinds of targeted advertising, pave the way for fines of up to 6% of global turnover and charge companies fees to pay for compliance. Europe is leading the way on internet regulation, developing standards and making demands of businesses that may, down the line, be adopted and adapted elsewhere. Already, California legislators have introduced measures based on the UK’s age appropriate design code – an attempt to retrofit platforms with the protective features that should have been there in the first place. In a speech last week, Barack Obama warned of the growing threat to democracy from online disinformation, and called for more accountability. But the emergence of the metaverse concept, in which Meta (formerly Facebook) invested $10bn last year, and the horrifying scenes in virtual-space games as highlighted by Dispatches, raise a disturbing prospect. This is that while policymakers scramble to control the chaos on existing platforms, the billionaires who control digital media are already leaping ahead, while ignoring – according to their ingrained habit – the new dangers that novel modes of online moneymaking are sure to create. Meta’s Quest was the most downloaded app on Christmas Day in 2021, with 8m Oculus headsets sold so far. Policymakers and campaigners deserve credit. Already, scrutiny of the UK bill has led to changes, including the long overdue introduction of compulsory age verification for pornography sites and the promise of clearer protections for the press. But there is no room for complacency. Women’s groups believe that measures aimed at tackling online sexual abuse are insufficient, despite the creation of a new cyberflashing offence. And there are concerns about how the bill will define “legal but harmful speech”, which major platforms will be required to shield adults from. Mumsnet fears that users’ discussions of topics such as eating disorders could fall foul of rules aimed at blocking damaging content. MPs from all parties should engage with these issues and encourage a wider debate. The initial lax regulatory approach to social media was a mistake. Assumptions of default good behaviour by users have been proved grossly overoptimistic. Companies should never have been allowed to launch products aimed at children without first proving that they were safe. If ministers are going to reject the NSPCC’s proposal of criminal penalties for tech company bosses who allow serious crimes against children to be committed on their platforms, they must explain why. As the charity points out, the financial services sector has them. The power, wealth and influence of the tech sector are immense. But governments are not weaklings. Online safety must never again be an afterthought.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on online dangers: the internet needs a retrofit | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/26/the-guardian-view-on-online-dangers-the-internet-needs-a-retrofit
4/27/2022,"England have been dealt a significant blow as they seek to secure another grand slam this weekend with their captain, Sarah Hunter, ruled out of the Six Nations decider against France on Saturday. The No 8 sustained a rib injury last weekend in the 69-0 victory against Ireland and will miss the showdown with France in Bayonne. In a testament to the influence of Hunter, who has amassed 134 caps for her country, she will join the squad in France this week to lend her support behind the scenes. Poppy Cleall, who was named captain against Italy when Hunter was selected on the bench, could fill the void on Saturday if she recovers from a calf problem. England head to Bayonne as favourites for the title, having been crowned champions in the previous three years. In 2019 and in 2020 England also clinched the grand slam, while last year the competition’s format was changed to a round robin because of the pandemic. Simon Middleton’s side edged their last Six Nations trip to France 19-13 in February 2020 but Les Bleus have also swept all before them this year and are in the hunt for the grand slam. The England men’s captain, Courtney Lawes, remains in the dark over whether he will play again this season. Lawes sustained a gruesome dislocated thumb this month and there is no timeframe over whether he will feature before the end of the season, or be fit for England’s tour of Australia. The Northampton coach, Phil Dowson, offered a more optimistic assessment but described Lawes as “Frankenstein’s monster” given the nature of the injury. “The scan revealed there was nothing broken but obviously it was an open dislocation so he’s been stitched up with a number of stitches,” said Dowson, whose side occupies the fourth and final playoff spot and host third-place Harlequins on Friday. “It’s pretty early days and there’s nothing broken. There’s ligament damage, tendon damage, bits and pieces like that ... he looks a bit like Frankenstein’s monster! So a weird injury, but he’s not too bad. It would be a massive lift for us if he’s back because he’s a very good player and that helps us.” Meanwhile, Steve Diamond has revealed that Worcester and Bath have failed in their attempts to bring forward their final-round Premiership match. The 12th-placed Warriors are due to host the bottom side Bath on 4 June in what could have been a thrilling relegation shootout but is now effectively a dead rubber with no side being demoted. All the more so because Worcester are not scheduled to have a match in May at all if they do not reach the Premiership Cup final and Bath are set for three empty weekends next month with both sides out of Europe. In order to bring the fixture forward, however, Diamond revealed that all 13 clubs had to unanimously agree and that one unnamed club voted against the other 12. The United Rugby Championship chief executive, Martin Anayi, has expressed an interest in establishing a women’s league to run alongside the men’s competition. Citing the Premier 15s in England, Anayi said: “We’re just exploring how that comes about now. There’s definitely a will – we’d love to see a women’s URC.”",Sport/Sport,England captain Sarah Hunter ruled out of Six Nations decider against France,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/26/sarah-hunter-england-six-nations-decider-france-rib-injury
