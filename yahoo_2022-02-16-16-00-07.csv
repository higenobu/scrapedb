Credit - Nikolay Muratkin–Anadolu Agency/Getty Images The latest revelations about Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva’s doping case raise more questions about the substances found in her sample—and the reasons why the 15-year-old might have failed the drug test. TIME asked leading experts to help make sense of the claims, which have upended the women’s figure skating competition at the Beijing Olympics and cast a larger pall over the sport. At the hearing held on Sunday by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), anti-doping authorities revealed that Valieva tested positive for three heart treatment drugs, one of which is banned as a performance-enhancer by the World Anti-Doping Agency. In addition to trimetazidine (TMZ), the prohibited substance, the New York Times reported that Valieva’s sample also contained hypoxen and L-carnatine, a supplement. All three are used for patients with angina, to improve blood flow and enhance function of the heart when it lacks oxygen. When she submitted a sample for testing in December, Valieva declared that she was taking hypoxen and L-carnatine, along with another compound, supradyn, a supplement that boosts immunity, according to documents reviewed by the Times. All three of those substances are allowed. To explain the presence of the prohibited drug, TMZ, Valieva’s lawyer argued that she was “contaminated” with the medication, potentially via contact with her grandfather, who appeared by video to say that he takes the medication. TMZ is prescribed to treat angina, because it can help increase blood flow to the heart and help the heart to work more efficiently. It’s not approved in the U.S., but is approved by the European Medicines Agency and other regulatory bodies. READ MORE: Kamila Valieva Is Allowed to Skate. The Battle Over Her Drug Test Is Just Beginning Russian newspaper Pravda reported that Valieva’s lawyers argued during the hearing, “There can be completely different ways how it got into her body. For example, grandfather drank something from a glass, salvia got in, this glass was somehow later used by an athlete. Or the drug lay down on some surface, traces remained, the drug lay down on this surface, which the athlete then drank.” Can the drug pass that easily from one person to another, and if so, would it appear in the recipient’s urine sample, as Valieva’s lawyer is claiming? “It reminds me of kids I knew who said they got venereal disease from the toilet seat,” says Dr. Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. Nissen says he’s not familiar with how sensitive the assays, a scientific measurement procedure, being used by the WADA lab are, but says that testing positive for a substance by drinking from the same glass as someone taking it is “very far-fetched.” “It’s hard to be definitive without knowing the assay [test] sensitivity, but it seems very, very unlikely,” he says. Valieva’s lawyer also claimed she might have come into contact with the medication on a surface and then somehow ingested it. Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, president of the American Heart Association and chair of preventive medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine says, “I’ve seen no evidence it gets absorbed through the skin.” He admits he doesn’t know how much of the drug was detected in the athlete’s sample, which would inform whether a brief contact with a small amount of the drug could explain her positive test. Lloyd-Jones also points out patients have to take TMZ three times a day, because it is metabolized by the body and excreted relatively quickly. Taken at the approved dose, the drug would reach its peak levels in the blood in anywhere from two to six hours, and the majority would be cleared within 24 hours. “It would seem implausible that a little bit on a glass or on her skin would have resulted in a positive test unless it happened to be just before she provided the sample,” he says. “One can draw inferences that either the exposure was very recent, very shortly before her test, or that she was exposed more chronically.” Ideally, a performance-enhancing drug has the same feature. “The ideal performance-enhancing compounds get in to improve performance, then get out without leaving a trace,” says Lloyd-Jones. READ MORE: Olympians Let Loose on Kamila Valieva and Russian Doping Controversy While TMZ is not available in the U.S., Nissen says there is a similar drug, ranolazine, that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration. That drug also shifts the energy source that heart cells use from fatty acids to glucose, which is more efficient. “That’s why it works for angina,” says Nissen. “It allows people to do more with less blood flow. Conceivably for an athlete, it would have similar benefit and would make the heart work more efficiently and give them a little edge.” Lloyd-Jones says this metabolic pathway also results in less build-up of lactic acid, which can cause muscle fatigue. “There are data from small trials in patients who have heart failure that that seem to indicate better heart performance for those who have a failing pump,” he says. “But whether that translates into the same benefit in a young, healthy person—I don’t think we know.” It’s also unclear what the consequences are of taking these compounds while the body is younger. “It’s certainly concerning, especially in a young person whose body is still developing,” says Lloyd-Jones. “We really don’t understand the long term effects of changing someone’s physiology at this age.” While the Court of Arbitration for Sport determined Valieva could compete in Beijing, her doping violation case remains unresolved, pending further investigation. That means the gold she and her teammates won in the team event, and any medal she wins in the women’s event could potentially be stripped if anti-doping officials conclude she doped and competed with an unfair advantage. That will hinge on additional testing of a second sample, provided from the same urine as her first, that will be analyzed to confirm the positive results from the first sample.",Health/Time,Heart Experts Cast Doubt on Claims That Russian Skater's Drug Test Was Contaminated by Her Grandfather’s Medicine,https://news.yahoo.com/heart-experts-cast-doubt-claims-045346835.html
2/16/2022,"Chinese financier Ding Peng said he wants his son to watch porn, sleep around and be a 'scumbag.' He said in a WeChat group that he didn't want his son to live a 'hard life' as he did. His comments have sparked social media fury about his parenting style and attitude towards women. Well-known Shanghai-based investor Ding Peng sparked a social media backlash after saying he plans to teach his teenage son to watch porn and sleep with many women so that he can be a ""scumbag."" He told other members in a group chat on the Chinese messaging app WeChat that he did not want his son to ""live a hard life"" as he did, reported the South China Morning Post. Ding is chairman of the China Quantitative Investment Society, which has 8,000 members in the financial industry and organizes talks and conducts research related to investing. Ding rose to fame in the early 2000s when he wrote a popular book about quantitative investment, ""Quantitative Investment — Strategies and Techniques,"" according to SCMP. SCMP described Ding as one of ""China's elite financiers"" who is a shareholder in two Chinese companies and senior manager of another. Ding's comments have since gone viral after being leaked by a chat group member, per SCMP. In screenshots shared on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, Ding wrote, ""I plan to get him to watch porn next year. I will teach him personally. He can start sleeping with girls in high school, and when he gets to college, he can give me a few babies."" Ding also said that he had transferred his son tens of thousands of yuan (at least $3,000) to treat girls to meals. ""He already has two girlfriends; he's better than me,"" he wrote. According to the leaked information, Ding's son is in Form Two, the equivalent of the eighth grade, and is believed to be 14 or 15 years old. ""I've lived a hard life. I just kept studying when I was young. I was still doing that when I was 30. I don't want him to follow my lead. I want him to be a scumbag,"" wrote Ding. On Chinese social media, the backlash to his comments was swift. Weibo users said he was disrespectful of women and a lousy parent teaching his child poor social values. ""He wants his son to sleep with many women? Even if he wants to brag about his wealth and powerful status, this is not the way to do it,"" said a Weibo user. Another commented on the difference between Ding's parenting style and Olympic skier Eileen Gu's mother. Gu, born in America and currently representing China at the Winter Olympics, has won over Chinese fans and has even been dubbed the country's ""snow princess."" ""[Eileen Gu's mother] has succeeded, she encourages her daughter to do the things she likes, and now she's a world ski champion. Ding Peng tells his son that he does not need to succeed, just sleep with many women. How can the difference between these two people be so big?"" the Weibo user wrote. Ding did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. On Monday, he told Chinese news outlet The Cover that his comments were ""taken out of context"" and that he made them after ""being goaded."" ""I made the comments casually, out of emotional agitation,"" he said. However, the same report also shared an earlier screenshot of a WeChat conversation he had with a friend, in which he said that he ""didn't care"" about the negative comments directed at him. ""This is no big deal, I don't care. Feel free to share [my comments],"" he said.

2/16/2022,"By Jonathan Allen ST PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) -Tou Thao, one of three former Minneapolis police officers on trial for violating George Floyd's civil rights, told a jury on Tuesday he did not realize Floyd was dying as an officer knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes. Testifying in his own defense at a federal trial that hinges on when police should intervene in colleagues' misconduct, Thao said he assumed Floyd's heart must still be beating because he never saw the other officers try to revive the 46-year-old handcuffed Black man, as their training demanded. Thao, 36, is accused with J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane of willfully violating Floyd's right to receive medical care as he lay dying, unable to properly breathe facedown beneath the knee of their former colleague, Derek Chauvin. Thao and Keung face a second count of depriving Floyd of his rights in their roles as government officials by failing to stop Chauvin's use of excessive force. Cellphone video of the arrest on May 25, 2020, led to protests against racism and police brutality around the world. Chauvin, who is white, was convicted of Floyd's murder last year at a separate state trial. Thao took the stand in U.S. District Court in St. Paul to convince jurors that he handled a chaotic scene in accordance with his training and with concern for the well-being of Floyd and the arresting officers. His testimony marks the first extensive public comment by any of the officers involved in the arrest. His two co-defendants say they will also testify. Thao can be seen on videos a few steps away from Floyd, keeping back horrified onlookers who scream at police to check Floyd's pulse as he falls unresponsive. The arrest occurred outside a grocery store where the man was accused of using a fake $20 bill. Questioned by his lawyer, Robert Paule, Thao said he believed that Chauvin and the other two officers, who were pinning down Floyd's legs, were checking Floyd's pulse, and was falsely reassured by seeing none of them stop to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. ""Logically, if they're not doing CPR, I assume he's still breathing and fine,"" Thao testified, agreeing with his lawyer that police are trained to start CPR as soon as possible if they cannot find a pulse. Floyd received no medical aid until after his limp body was lifted into an ambulance, several minutes after he fell unresponsive. Thao testified that he had confirmed with other officers that an ambulance had been called, and saw his role as a ""human traffic cone,"" making sure oncoming traffic steered clear. Jurors watched video from Thao's body-worn camera that shows Thao arriving to find Kueng and Lane struggling to get a handcuffed Floyd to stay in the back of a police car. Floyd screams repeatedly that he is claustrophobic and cannot breathe. ""Not to besmirch, but I've never seen this much of a struggle,"" Thao testified, saying he had been an officer for eight years by that time. ""It was obvious that he was under the influence of some kind of drugs."" He said Floyd was incoherent and impossible to calm, and he feared the man might be having a dangerous reaction to drugs. A medical examiner, who ruled that Floyd was killed by the police restraint and neck compression, found fentanyl and methamphetamine in Floyd's blood. Thao said it was normal during training sessions to see an officer using a knee near the neck to pin down a person they were arresting. Jurors were shown photographs of Thao and his classmates using such restraints. ""Were you ever instructed that using knees was improper technique?"" Paule asked his client. ""No,"" Thao replied. Over three weeks of witness testimony, prosecutors have sought to show the jury that all three men were well trained in their duty of care to the public. In cross-examination by prosecutor LeeAnn Bell, Thao agreed on Tuesday that he had an obligation to intervene if he saw a crime, and that it was a crime for a police officer to use excessive force. ""You don't get a pass just because you're a police officer, right?"" Bell asked. Thao agreed. A POOR UPBRINGING Thao told the jury he grew up in a poor, refugee household: His parents, members of the Hmong ethnic group, fled to Minnesota from Laos. He said he was inspired to become an officer when, as a child, he let Minneapolis police into his house to arrest his father for threatening Thao and his mother with a gun. According to court filings based on police records, Thao was cited at least seven times while being trained in the field over several months in 2012 for shirking his duties, sometimes pretending not to see violations of the law in order to minimize his workload.
