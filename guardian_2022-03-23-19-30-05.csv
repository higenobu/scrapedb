3/23/2022,"“War, as the American Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman observed, “is hell.” The one that Russia launched against Ukraine on February 24 certainly fits his description. Cities have come under siege – consider the horrific plight of Mariupol – a hospital and a shopping mall have been struck, as have apartment buildings, in Kyiv as well as Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city. The number of refugees and internally displaced Ukrainians already exceeds 10 million, more than a fifth of the country’s population. Yet there’s something about this war that has been distinctive: it has defied all expectations, above all of those who started it. As the Russian military buildup around Ukraine’s perimeter accelerated at the end of last year, few experts believed that Vladimir Putin would order a full-blown invasion, let alone one aimed at toppling the Ukrainian government and installing a puppet leadership. The Biden administration kept warning that he was preparing to do precisely that, but most observers treated its predictions skeptically. The scenario seemed outlandish – and then there were those post-9/11 intelligence failures. This time, however, the US government got it right. But few observers, even seasoned military analysts, anticipated what happened once the war began. The Ukrainians mounted a surprisingly stiff resistance from the get-go, partly because they were defending their homeland, partly because they had been preparing for this eventuality and had created Territorial Defense Forces in preparation, and partly because of the weapons and training provided them since 2015 by the United States, Britain, and Canada. Still, the balance of power overwhelmingly favored Russia, whether in the number of troops, the quantity of major armaments (such as tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, and warplanes), and their technological caliber. So lopsided was the advantage that it was hardly unreasonable to assume that the Russian juggernaut would roll over the Ukrainians’ valiant resistance and conquer their major cities. Assaying the military balance between two putative adversaries involves, in part, bean counting – so many of this weapon, so many of that, and so on – but the exercise generally proves valid when the results massively favor one side. The exceptions are remembered because they are uncommon. This war has been one of those atypical instances. Even if it ends with Ukraine’s defeat – something that remains possible – this surely is not the campaign Putin and his generals had in mind. Nearly a month into it, Russia has sustained heavy losses: in soldiers and all categories of armaments. Moreover, logistical problems (in plain terms, supplying an army waging war) – such as insufficient food, water, and petrol – and breakdowns of equipment have been legion. Leave aside the precise number of Russian losses. There has been, and will be, much disagreement about them. This much is clear: no one, least of Putin, expected a lackluster performance like this from a Russian army that, following the problems revealed during the 2008 Russia-Georgia war, had been revamped by big increases in investment as well as reforms and modernization. Before this war began, then, there was good reason to expect a rapid Russian offensive: a combined-arms operation that opened with cyberattacks against Ukrainian command and control networks and swift control of Ukraine’s airspace by Russian warplanes, eventually paving the way for an armored assault protected by air cover. In the event, there were poorly coordinated advances resembling probes. Ukraine’s main army formations, such as the one between the Dnieper River and eastern Ukraine, still have not been surrounded and decimated. Nor have any big cities been taken. True, Russia has made significant territorial gains, especially along the Black Sea coast and in the east; and a land corridor has been created, albeit not consolidated (Mariupol hasn’t surrendered), connecting Russia to Crimea along the Sea of Azov littoral. What’s not clear, however, is whether, even on the Black Sea coast and points north of Crimea, the degree of control that Russian forces have is strong enough to allow many to be diverted from there to other battlegrounds, such as the one around Kyiv. Given the number of Russian strikes on civilian targets, they can’t reasonably be attributed to error alone. Instead, they appear to stem from Russian commanders’ frustration and the Russian leadership’s decision to inflict so much pain on Ukraine’s people and such colossal damage on its economic assets that President Volodymyr Zelensky will be forced to accept a draconian peace. So far, despite their enormous suffering, Ukrainians seem resilient, as witness the continuing resistance in Mariupol despite the humanitarian disaster there. How can we account for what has transpired. One book, based on a number of cases, provides some explanations: John Stoessinger’s Why Nations Go to War. Stoessinger concludes that the initiators of wars, notably the top leaders, tend to make the same mistakes, repeatedly: so much for learning from history. Contempt for their opponents convinces them that they lack the will to fight back. Those who start wars therefore expect a quick victory – Putin reportedly told the president of the European Commission in 2014 that he could take Kyiv in a fortnight if he wanted to – and don’t make plans for a prolonged campaign if that assumption proves erroneous. The leader at the pinnacle doesn’t take kindly to underlings who summon the courage to question the upbeat assumptions. And though Stoessinger doesn’t make this point, if the country is run by an all-powerful leader, such as Putin, subordinates are probably reluctant to convey bad news. The outcome of the war between Russia and Ukraine remains uncertain. But were Stoessinger alive – he died in 2017 – he might be taking notes, thinking that it could well serve as a chapter in the book’s next edition.

3/23/2022,"While all eyes were on another horror, our war against the living world went nuclear. Over the weekend, temperatures at some weather stations in the Arctic rose to 30C above normal. Simultaneously, at certain weather stations in the Antarctic they hit 40C above normal. Two events, albeit off the scale, do not make a trend. But as part of a gathering record of extreme and chaotic weather, these unprecedented, simultaneous anomalies are terrifying. On their heels came news of another horrific event: mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef during a La Niña year. La Niña is the cool phase of the Pacific cycle. Until now, widespread bleaching had happened only during the warmer El Niño years. The likely impacts of the next El Niño are too awful to contemplate. We knew that climate breakdown would happen abruptly. Earth systems that seemed stable, lives that seemed safe, would slip from under us. All that we took for granted would suddenly be in play. It could be happening now. A characteristic of complex systems is that it’s hard to tell how close to their critical thresholds they may be until they have been crossed. Are we now passing the tipping points? The only rational response is to act as if it’s not too late, and as if we have the briefest of opportunities to stabilise the system before it slides. Instead, as if to announce its intention to push us past the point of no return, the UK government floated plans to cut fuel duty this week. Since the Cop26 climate summit last November, it has approved one new oil and gas field in the North Sea and proposes to approve six more. A paper published yesterday by Dr Dan Calverley and Prof Kevin Anderson at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research shows that to permit just a 50% chance of staying within 1.5C of heating, rich nations need to end all oil and gas production by 2034. In other words, just as these new concessions start to deliver, they will need to be closed down. But perversity is the norm. The government discourages energy efficiency improvements by subjecting them to the highest rate of VAT (20%). When it slashed green renovation grants in 2013, the number of loft insulations fell from 1.6m a year to 126,000, and the rate has never recovered. We could see this as an experiment: what happens when you remove government incentives and leave it to “the market”? Ah yes, we discover that energy transition is entirely dependent on effective state policy. As the government’s own Climate Change Committee observed this month, though, the UK’s strategy for decarbonising buildings relies on “voluntary targets” and “an untested market-based approach”. There are massive funding gaps, missing plans and a shocking absence of regulatory levers: it’s impossible to see on the basis of current policy how the government could meet even its own pathetic targets, let alone contribute meaningfully to preventing climate breakdown. Climate denial comes in waves and the current variety, endlessly recited by rightwing Tory MPs, is to insist that the energy transition is “unaffordable”. But as the committee’s report shows, the average total cost of decarbonising homes is under £10,000. Even if every home in the UK were fully renovated, it would cost less, on these figures, than the government’s spending on either the pandemic or the 2008 financial crisis. The jobs created would ensure that it recouped at least some of the money. Yet again, we must ask ourselves why governments bail out banks but not the planet. Some have begun to step up. In Italy, the government provides a remarkable 110% of the cost of home energy improvements, which it pays as a five-year tax credit (the 10% covers financial and transaction costs). This superbonus scheme pays for everything: insulation, ventilation, new windows and doors, solar panels, heat pumps. It has design flaws – for example, it creates no incentive for builders to limit their costs and was, at first, open to fraud – but these issues could be easily addressed. Finland has equipped roughly one-third of its homes with heat pumps. It installs about twice as many every year as the UK does, though it has only about a 10th of the number of homes. Almost every day, I hear professional ignoramuses announce that “heat pumps wouldn’t work in our cold climate”. But they work just fine in Finland, which is much colder. The Netherlands proposes to disconnect all its homes from the gas grid. In Estonia, the capital city, Tallinn, and most other counties offer free public transport. If Italy and Estonia can afford it, so can we. As the Climate Change Committee points out, if gas prices remain as high as they are at the moment, decarbonising the whole economy would save money (0.5% of GDP). It would also lift people out of fuel poverty, which is greatly exacerbated by leaky homes and a reliance on fossil fuels. It would ensure that we were no longer beholden to Vladimir Putin and other fossil-fuelled autocrats. The truth is that we can’t afford not to transform our economies. It’s not decarbonisation that’s unaffordable; it’s climate breakdown. If climate systems tip, our money will be as worthless as Boris Johnson’s promises. Yet this government values it above life itself. George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist. He will discuss Regenesis at a Guardian Live event on Monday 30 May.

3/23/2022,"Rod Stewart’s train setup isn’t exactly the sort of thing you would find in a child’s bedroom. His epic Grand Street & Three Rivers City is a stunningly realistic 139 sq metre (1,500 sq ft) depiction of a mid-20th-century industrialised city. Based on 1940s Manhattan and Chicago, the labour of love – which has pride of place in his Beverly Hills mansion – includes skyscrapers up to 5ft tall, warehouses, bridges and rush-hour traffic, with period cars and lorries, reproduced sections of river and even a startlingly detailed miniature power station. “It took me 23 years to build [and it’s] bigger than most people’s houses,” he told the Guardian in November. “It’s very expensive, but worth it, ’cos it’s my favourite hobby. I work on it every day.” Rod the Mod isn’t the only music star with a double life in railway modelling. Neil Young has a modelling alias (Clyde Coil) and reportedly at one point had a huge barn containing 230 metres of track, complete with trains, buildings, trees and tunnels. Elton John is believed to have a track running through his garden. Jools Holland’s collection, which runs to 30 metres long, includes a route from London to Berlin. Going back a bit, Frank Sinatra was said to own $1m worth of model trains and replicas of his native Hoboken, New Jersey, which he kept in a room called – but of course – All Aboard. Rock gods known to have private passions for tiny engines and carriages include Roger Daltrey, Bruce Springsteen, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins and Ringo Starr. But perhaps the music and railway modelling worlds aren’t as different as they might seem. Musicians have been writing songs about train travel since at least 1828, when Arthur Clifton wrote the Carrollton March to commemorate the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which opened two years later. The train features in many a spiritual or blues song and is often depicted as a gateway to a promised land. Woody Guthrie’s catalogue is packed with rail songs – Train Blues, This Train Is Bound for Glory and Lost Train Blues – while pop songs referencing train travel stretch from the early Elvis Presley single Mystery Train to Kraftwerk’s Trans-Europe Express and Stewart’s hit cover of Tom Waits’ Downtown Train. Some songs even have rhythms reminiscent of chugging trains, from Louis Jordan’s Choo Choo Ch’Boogie (“Take me right back to the track, Jack”) to Led Zeppelin’s version of When the Levee Breaks. So, the fascination with trains is partly conventional nostalgia, but may be more deeply ingrained in the sounds we heard as children and the experience of riding on a train. “I’m sure a psychologist would have a field day with us,” says Pete Waterman, the producer/songwriter behind Kylie Minogue, Rick Astley and Jason Donovan. He is one of the UK’s foremost railway modellers. “But it’s about hands-on creativity and a huge amount of research, which isn’t that different to making music. “Rod’s work is fantastic. What he does with those American buildings takes skill. Not everybody can pick up a piece of plastic and cardboard and build like he does. Rod’s big thing is skyscrapers. Mine is trees. I’ll make them out of wire and spend hours putting all the leaves on.” This has become an obsession, to which he devotes the same energy as he once did to hit records. “In the music industry, you’re constantly sussing out what your competitors are doing and what’s going on,” says Waterman, who recently designed and built a 20-metre-long layout in Chester Cathedral. “It’s exactly the same thought process I brought to Kylie or whoever: ‘I’ve got a No 1 single. How do I get another one?’ It’s just that, instead of wondering where I should put a cymbal, I’m thinking: ‘Does that tree work there? Is that house too close to the railway line?’ It ticks exactly the same boxes.” He admits that sitting awake at night pondering such questions does sometimes make him think: “It’s a model railway! Am I going nuts?” There is a stigma attached, he says, especially for someone involved in music. While dreaded catcalls such as “trainspotter” and “grownup playing with toys” aren’t as potent as they were, he doesn’t think “Rod would have talked about this stuff 20 years ago”. Waterman was a trainspotter (at Leamington Spa station, of which he has built a model) in his youth. His charity, Waterman Railway Heritage Trust, now houses full-size steam trains and locomotives. “After I came out [as a modeller], everyone came out. I’m proud to be called a nerd or a trainspotter. I don’t mug people. I model trains.” He suspects there are far more famous modellers than we know about. “I’ve had loads of famous people whisper to me: ‘I’m into it, too.” The bug usually starts in childhood. Waterman, 75, got his first plastic clockwork locomotive when he was very young; his first track was on a board placed on the bath. “I’ve had trains for all but 18 months of my life. That’s got to be a record,” he says with a chuckle. Most people drift out of the hobby in their teens, or when they start work and no longer have the time or space. “Then you get to a point in your life where you have more disposable income,” says Dave Minarik, a railway modelling columnist who is also the drummer for the Pittsburgh-based country-rockers the Clarks (they have a song called Train). “So you open up the closet and pull those boxes out again.” It can be astonishingly expensive. Waterman admits he can’t justify spending between £4,000 and £5,000 on a specialist 0-gauge locomotive. “Even a standard HST [high-speed train] set is up to £180, just for the two power cars,” he says. But, generally, successful musicians have more of the time, cash and space needed to indulge than most. Waterman built his first serious layout in a cowshed in his garden. Stewart’s childhood bedroom looked out over a railway line and he built his first track in the family’s council house in the 60s. He started his epic Three Rivers construction in 1993, making 90% of it himself, even while touring, when he would hire an additional hotel room each night for the tracks. “It’s a great form of escape,” says Minarik. “You’re in control of your own world and, as bad as the real world is sometimes, it can be sunny every day on your layout. There’s no crime and definitely no politics. It’s one of the few places you can go where you only have to deal with things that are pleasant or fun.” Steve Flint, the editor of Railway Modeller, who has interviewed Stewart for his magazine, argues that, as with rock’n’roll, there is an element of role play. “We become the signal man, then we plot the timetables or drive the trains.” Some people literally dress the part, although Waterman strongly rejects his daughters’ suggestion that he “dress up as a bloody station master”. Equally, modelling can help during troubled times. Young – who received his first train set as a child – built a huge layout and devised special controls so that his son Ben, who has cerebral palsy, could control the trains. When Waterman’s son Paul died in 2005 at 33, Waterman couldn’t listen to music, but modelling gave him solace. “Oh, it was a lifesaver,” he says. “In the nicest way, because you’re concentrating on the trains and not thinking about all the crap that’s going on around you. You don’t run away from it, but it’s that little bit easier to face every day.” It was the other way around for me (yes, a confession: I love model railways). My dad built mine when I was five; after he died a year later, the train set became a way of remembering and connecting with him. “I’d guess a lot of us are loners,” Waterman says. “In the music industry, although you’re part of a group or a team, you’re very isolated in the way you think. As a kid, I was on my own a lot, so to play I had to get on and do it.” He still does, although he says he enjoys the camaraderie of being part of a model-building team. “I always loved that about the [real] railways. There’s the driver, the fitter, the boiler man … The organisation still fascinates me – and the feeling of being safe.” This year, his team is planning an even bigger layout in Chester. “Once you’ve got the bug, you want to build a bigger one. Not because bigger is better, but because you want to sort out all the problems.” Ann Diamond is one of the few famous female modellers, while Michael Jordan is the only high-profile black celebrity – but probably won’t be for much longer. “We see far more non‑white faces at the exhibitions now,” says Tom Cunnington, the vice-president and exhibitions manager at the Model Railway Club, which was established in 1910. There are more women, too. “Some might have originally brought their kids, but then they’ve got into it, too. Everyone is welcome and it’s no longer a male preserve.” Waterman agrees. “Some of the best modellers in the UK, if not in Europe, are women now, and there are LGBT and transgender modellers [including Eddie Izzard],” he says. “You’d never have got that 25 years ago.” For Flint, celebrity hobbyists such as Stewart and Waterman are doing the hobby a “brilliant favour” by publicising it and even making it – gulp – cooler. “There are still occasional sneers, but railway modelling is regarded as more normal,” he says. He was particularly thrilled to be able to put Stewart on the cover of Railway Modeller, after the legendary rocker insisted that starring on the cover of a modelling magazine was “better than being on the cover of Rolling Stone”.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘I’m proud to be called a nerd!’ The pop and rock greats who love model railways,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/23/im-proud-to-be-called-a-nerd-the-pop-and-rock-greats-who-love-model-railways
3/23/2022,"For years Arby’s has bragged: “We have the meats.” Now the menu includes a spicy beef with McDonald’s. On Monday, the hot deli chain released an advertisement for its crispy fish sandwich. Undergirding the EDM-tinged backing beat is the rap song Spicy Fish Diss – a single-verse Scud missile that takes direct aim at McDonald’s pescatarian mainstay, the Filet-O-Fish. And it doesn’t waste any of its 75-second runtime beating around the bush. “Filet-O-Fish is shit,” it crows, “and you should be disgusted.” Even more delicious than this taster is the man serving it – Pusha T, the 44-year-old Virginia Beach-raised master lyricist who formed half of the Pharrell Williams-produced rap duo the Clipse (with his older brother, No Malice) and is the highest-profile act signed to GOOD Music besides the label’s founder, Ye (formerly known as Kanye West). For Pusha, the Arby’s gig was no odd job (Arby’s We Have the Meats campaign also licensed Yogi and Skrillex’s 2014 EDM hit Burial featuring the rapper); it was personal. Pusha has long alleged that he wrote McDonald’s I’m Lovin’ It jingle along with No Malice, Williams and Justin Timberlake, and he has held a grudge against the company for shortchanging him as the micro-tune has become one of the most recognizable jingles of all time. Nineteen years ago, Timberlake first recorded the jingle; these days it’s Succession’s Brian Cox who lazily warbles the familiar “ba-da-ba-ba-ba” in Golden Arches commercials. “It was like half a million or a million dollars for me and my brother,” Pusha told Rolling Stone of his one-time fee for the McDonald’s hit. “But that’s peanuts for as long as [the jingle] has been running. I had to get that energy off of me, and this [Arby’s spot] was the perfect way.” From Ella Fitzgerald scatting about KFC to MC Hammer hot-footing for Taco Bell to Mary J Blige howling for Burger King’s crispy chicken, Black music stars have been sirens for fast food chains from the day they set up shop in Black neighborhoods – where, sadly, they often loom large as the most viable meal plan for under-resourced families. Five years ago, Arby’s made a hard pivot from the suburbs to the streets when it committed to a pitchman in Ving Rhames, the husky-toned Pulp Fiction star who delivers the company’s meaty slogan. Business has boomed ever since. Still, it’s shocking that it’s taken until now for a food company to adopt a rap battle stance in defense of conspicuous mass consumption. After all, what is fast food advertising but Arby’s crowing about their meat, McDonald’s boasting about sales and Carl’s Jr wallowing in gratuitous breasts and thighs? Even Chick-fil-A has a Jesus piece. From the off, the whole business has been about real hip-hop, which itself is larded to the ventricles with references to favorite chains. (“I got the socket so plug me,” Migos trill, “Solitaire, Chicken McNuggets.”) You’d be hard pressed to name a more battle-worn gladiator in this arena than Pusha. Besides a decades long feud with Drake, he is famous for spinning artful stories rooted in his past life as a drug dealer. (Interestingly, his name and raspy voice dominate the Arby’s ad, but he never appears on camera.) In Spicy Fish Diss, which commands attention with Dalí-esque, Old Man and the Sea visual grammar, Pusha gets away with many double entendres, none juicier than this: “With lines ’round the corner, we might need a guest list.” Even Pusha’s choice of which Arby’s product to endorse is a wink: “If you know me and you know me well / Our fish is gonna tip that scale.” (“Fishscale” is slang for a flakey, premium grade of cocaine.) On Twitter, some made a game of reconstructing the notes call between Pusha and Arby’s execs while penning rejected lyrics. And more hip-hop fans celebrated this collaboration than denounced Pusha, who gets paid every time the Arby’s spot airs, as a sellout. Will this simmering tension lead to more peppery fare? Megan Thee Stallion (Popeyes), Rick Ross (Wingstop) and Travis Scott (McDonald’s) are already in the game. They’re already in position to fire shots back and, like Pusha, posting their bars large over the commercial video so their wordplay can be explicitly appreciated. It could be just the thing that pulls hip-hop out of its hallucinogenic doldrums and back into the realm of combat sport. Of course there are bound to be some who interpret battle rap-themed fast food ads as a bad omen for the country. But they probably never had the stomach for this kind of stuff anyway. It’s about time fast food rivals drop their family-friendly pretensions and start really going for one another’s jugulars in commercials. At the end of the day, it’s all empty calories. A spicy beef just adds flavor. ",Arts/Music,Fish feud: can McDonald’s survive Pusha T’s single-verse scud missile?,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/23/pusha-t-arbys-mcdonalds-filet-o-fish
3/23/2022,"I’m traveling with photographer Carlton Ward Jr through southwestern Florida, driving through a busy highway outside Naples. Palm and pine trees flank the roads, and the morning humidity is thick. Backcountry supplies and camera equipment rattle in the backseat as he drives. We’re following the path of the elusive Florida panther. Our chances to spot one are slim: scientists estimate that only 200 of them remain in the wild in the US. Lean and fawn-colored, these carnivores once roamed most of the southeastern US. At one point, the panther population dwindled to an estimated 20 individuals, bottlenecked in southwestern Florida. Ward, an accomplished conservation photographer and National Geographic explorer, has captured some of the most thrilling – and up close – images of the big cats, in hopes of drawing attention to their battle against extinction. The panthers need space to live with ecological integrity; they require large swaths of contiguous habitat to hunt, mate and raise their offspring. Climate change and development are straining their already-fragmented habitat. Ward, an eighth-generation Floridian, serves as a leading advocate for the Florida Wildlife Corridor – a plan that would conserve and connect 17.7m acres so that panthers and other wildlife can move safely within their native range. Floridians are almost out of time to save the last of the state’s native habitat – only about 15% remains. Conservation efforts have significant bipartisan support in Florida, but are up against a tsunami of housing development. One million people move to Florida every three years. Those changes are visible on our drive: we pass human-made canals, dozens of For Sale signs, and the occasional high-density neighborhood, all reminders that fragmented panther populations can only survive for so long before development engulfs their last chances of habitat preservation and connection. To illustrate the panthers’ need for a connected landscape, Ward brings me to the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge, which, at 26,400 acres, is still not enough to support a single panther’s home range. Female panthers require 40-80 square miles to establish their territory; male panthers require 200. Wildlife biologist Mark Danaher greets us. A charismatic backcountry expert, he’s the kind of scientist who manages an enormous and complex refuge but can also handle poisonous rattlesnakes. We jump into his ATV and drive past wetlands and stands of slash pines to visit a wildlife underpass, where Danaher kneels to point out panther tracks in the sand. Overhead the traffic from I-75 – the interstate highway that crosses through the Everglades and then runs north – is deafening. Vehicle strikes are the leading cause of death for Florida panthers. But overpasses and underpasses, like those installed by the refuge, are proving effective. In 2012, a trail camera at the refuge captured a Florida panther moving three cubs. One became known as “Broketail” for her injured tail’s distinctive crimping. In January 2022, a camera captured Broketail, now 10 years old, using the safety of the underpass to move her own three cubs from the neighboring Picayune Strand state forest to the heart of the refuge. “She was born here, and now she’s teaching her own kittens how to hunt and navigate the landscape,” Danaher tells me. “It’s a testament to her intelligence and survival skills.” It’s also a testament to the power of connectivity. The underpasses work. “Wildlife can do a lot with a little help,” Ward says. “We just have to give them a chance.” That afternoon, Ward and I drive into the backcountry of Audubon’s Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary to visit another piece of the corridor puzzle. Corkscrew is a 13,000 acre refuge with 500-year-old cypress trees and wetlands managed for wildlife. At 21 square miles, the sanctuary isn’t large enough for a panther’s home range, but female panthers are known to raise cubs there. I sit down at a shaded picnic table to talk with the sanctuary’s director, Lisa Korte. “We believe in maintaining corridors,” Korte says. “Animals shouldn’t be dead-ended. We’re a place where a panther can feel safe.” Proposed developments to the north and west of Corkscrew’s boundaries put this goal at risk. To ensure the best outcomes, Korte says the sanctuary is friendly with its neighbors, models native habitat management, and encourages buffer zones between the sanctuary and housing developments. While at Corkscrew, we check Ward’s camera traps and stop to view some of the last old-growth cypress trees, known panther watering holes, and barbed wire fences where panthers have been photographed moving between ranches and the sanctuary. At dusk, Ward captures drone footage of traffic hurtling along I-75. He’s indefatigable, always searching for a compelling shot that will help others realize the plight of the panther, and the need to conserve and connect land. In pursuit of this goal, he has even been bitten by an alligator while checking a camera trap. After nightfall, we stop by an old metal bridge which lies across the Caloosahatchee river, a feature which often restricts the contemporary northern range of the panther. Ward hopes that one day a healthy breeding population of panthers will extend northward from here, perhaps even to the Georgia border. Standing on the bridge, I’m disoriented by the dark water, lights and traffic. Recently someone captured an image of a panther limping across this very spot at night – on what must have been an arduous, disconcerting and biologically necessary trip. Before arriving in Florida, I spoke about wildlife corridors with renowned road ecologist Marcel Huijser. “Animals need food, water and mates,” he explained to me over a Zoom call from Montana. “It’s dangerous for them to pursue these needs across the road.” Generally, Huijser says, most departments of transportation make decisions on wildlife mitigation measures based on human safety and economics, but rarely factor in the value of animal lives. “We don’t yet agree on the value of biological conservation,” he said. While warning signage is inexpensive and popular, he adds that “there are no easy answers to complex problems, but that’s what people want: a quick fix, simple, inexpensive, done tomorrow. Instead, we have to stay focused on the problems, and change our economic priorities, because it’s expensive to do nothing.” A recent study showed a discrepancy between how Americans value wildlife, and how the DOTs design roads. When surveyed, people indicated they wanted better outcomes for wildlife – through fencing and over- and underpasses – and were willing to pay for it. “It’s not just about if a species can survive,” Huijser said. “But can they live a natural life?” Though it goes against the popular narrative about Florida politics, conservation enjoys broad bipartisan support in the state. Republican governors approved (and later undermined) earlier initiatives like Florida Preservation 2000, which allotted $300m a year for conservation purchases, and Florida Forever, a Jeb Bush initiative that has saved more than 800,000 acres. The Florida Wildlife Corridor Act, which Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law in June 2021, may be the most progressive yet. Astoundingly, the state senate passed the act – which defines the boundaries of the corridor – with a vote of 40-0, and the house with a vote of 115-0. A budget of $300m has been set aside for corridor-specific preservation, and an additional $100m for Florida Forever (80% of projects in the Florida Forever initiative are inside the orridor’s boundaries). “The corridor is ambitious,” Ward says, “but achievable, if lawmakers keep investing in the conservation easements and public land acquisitions that will give landowners viable alternatives to development.” Florida’s forward-looking corridor project provides a blueprint for other states to follow when contributing to President Biden’s 30-by-30 conservation plan – the goal to conserve and restore 30% of America’s land and rivers. Ward tells me that some of the best conservation opportunities are not in perfectly open and conserved land, but working lands: ranches (which constitute 33% of the best future opportunities for additions to the corridor), timberlands (43%), former tomato fields, orange groves, and even an enormous active military zone known as the Avon Park Air Force range – which contains swaths of undeveloped habitat. Ward’s family still owns traditional ranches. His comfort in the back country endears him to scientists, sportsmen, private landowners and traditional ranchers, making him a critical connection point for corridor support. “I believe in academic conservation targets,” Ward says. “But these high-level goals need to be met with on-the-ground strategies, built from local consensus. That’s where wildlife corridors come in. When approached the right way, they can bring people together to establish enduring bipartisan support.” At the end of our first day in the field, Ward and I drive into Archbold Biological Station, a center focused on sharing science for land management. Founded in 1941, Archbold lies within the headwaters of the Everglades, on top of a raised topographical feature of ancient sand dunes. The next morning, I awake to the intoxicating scent of orange blossoms from neighboring citrus groves, many of which are untouched due to labor shortages and a bacterial disease called citrus greening. You can feel change in the margins of the landscape. After coffee, Ward introduces me to predator biologist Joe Guthrie, another corridor advocate. Guthrie – a former football player from Kentucky who reads the New Yorker but also regularly collars bears – cranks up a swamp buggy, a custom vehicle made on top of a truck chassis. We spend a few hours driving through varied and endangered Florida landscapes on large ranches, including patches of ancient scrub that host rare endemic plants. Guthrie shows me saw palmettos and oak hammocks, which, depending on the season, produce critical food sources for wildlife such as nuts and acorns – and provide good cover for dens. Invasive feral hogs and heat tolerant cattle move in the distance. An expert tracker, Guthrie easily spots bear claw marks on palm trunks and old prints. He explains the seasonal movements of predator species, and what they need from traditional Florida landscapes. Later that afternoon, I board another swamp buggy with the charismatic Hilary Swain, the longtime director of the Archbold Research Station. Swain is a hardcore hybrid of a rancher and a scientist, the kind of woman who can talk about both carbon sequestration and the fattening of calves with ease. The scientific work done at Archbold’s ranch helps inform practices for other working lands – managing water flow, phosphorus levels and grazing patterns. I’m astounded by the richness of central Florida’s ranchlands. Meadowlarks are singing in the grassy fields as Swain guides me through Archbold’s ranch; kestrels perch on the powerlines. Egrets and roseate spoonbills flush from the alligator-flecked swamps. When ranchers preserve native landscapes like slash pine and scrub and tolerate the presence of native species, including megafauna like bears and panthers, wildlife abounds – significantly more than if the land were a strip mall or housing development. “Many private landowners are already good conservationists,” Swain says, a map of the ranch across her lap. “Ranchers have also realized that conservation can be good for the bottom line, in terms of easements and payments for environmental services and ecological tourism.” “Most of us want to save this landscape and keep it sustainable. We’re saving the last of the last. What happens here in central Florida is not independent of what happens on the Florida coastline, or the country, for that matter.” My last morning in Florida, Ward insists I visit another working ranch so that I can meet Cary Lightsey, a rancher he admires and credits with being an early adopter of the corridor concept. We drive on to the farm as cowboys on horseback prepare to round up a group of heifers and calves. Lightsey’s son-in-law offers me a seat on the back of an ATV. In minutes we’re flying across the pasture, dipping in and out of wet ditches as we back up the skilful cowboys, one of whom is 81. They turn their horses on a dime and steer the cows from the pasture toward the barn, where the calves will be castrated and dewormed, then returned to their mothers. A longtime vegetarian, I’m slightly uncomfortable, but perhaps that’s the point – learning to spot shared values and cooperate with people with whom you may not be fully aligned. I quickly come to admire the skill and family atmosphere of Lightsey’s operation. Lightsey invites me to lunch, where I sit next to the blue-eyed 81-year-old cowboy, who tells wild stories about the traveling medicine shows of his boyhood. When we say goodbye, the mutual respect between Ward and Lightsey is evident. “I’ve learned a lot from him,” Lightsey says. “Cary Lightsey is a hero to me,” Ward tells me later. “I don’t know another living rancher who has done more for conservation. In addition to protecting 90% of his family’s land in conservation easements starting 30 years ago, his leadership has helped inspire other ranchers to do the same, including members of my own family.” Florida’s bipartisan conservation efforts are not just inspiring; they’re the only path forward for biodiversity. Most people want to live in a Florida that is more than a series of housing developments. They want to live in a Florida where Broketail and her kittens can hunt and flourish, not die on the side of a highway. I think about my conversation with Huijser. “If our current road and conservation efforts don’t reflect our values,” he said, “we can change them, and moreover, we should.” These values – of offering safe passage to wildlife and preserving natural landscapes – are often more shared than we realize. Moreover, with planning and cooperation, they’re entirely possible. When Ward and I were driving, he pointed out I-75’s 8ft-high fencing with reverse-angle barbed wire, which discourages wildlife from crossing the road. Just weeks ago, a female Florida panther died crossing the road near a toll booth where the fencing stopped.",News/Environment,‘We’re saving the last of the last’: what Florida’s endangered panthers need to survive ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/23/florida-panthers-endangered-need-to-survive
3/23/2022,"“Watching Bayern Munich play Salzburg last night got me wondering: what professional teams are the closest to each other but are in different countries?” wonders David Gough. “And which are the closest never to play each other?” It’s around 130km from Bayern’s Allianz Arena to the Red Bull Arena in Salzburg – a pretty convenient trip for border-hopping away fans but by no means the shortest. Let’s begin our jaunt around the close neighbours divided by international borders in northern Europe. Denmark’s FC Copenhagen took on Sweden’s Malmö in the 2019-20 Champions League with the teams having to travel just 43km across the Øresund Bridge to get to the away leg. The Fortuna Sittard Stadion in the Netherlandsm– home of, um, Fortuna Sittard – is a mere 32.4km from Alemannia Aachen’s New Tivoli Stadium across the border in Germany, while it’s a 30.5km scenic trip between Swiss top-flight action at FC Lugano’s Stadio Cornaredo and Serie C fare at Como 1907’s Stadio Giuseppe Sinigaglia in northern Italy. Just 29km separate Lille’s Stade Pierre Mauroy to KV Kortrijk’s Guldensporen Stadion in Belgium. Meanwhile, Trieste and Koper sit side by side at the top of the Istrian peninsula but the former is in Italy, the latter in Slovenia. FC Koper’s Stadion Bonifika plays host to top-flight football while Triestina, founder members of Serie A in 1929-30, currently play in Serie C at the Stadio Nereo Rocco around 15.5km away. The sides often meet in pre-season friendlies. The best we can find in Europe are two lower-level teams separated by a cross-border walk of 3.1km, taking about 10 minutes. Third-tier Finnish side TP-47 play their home games at Pohjan Stadion in Tornio, with Sweden’s sixth-tier Haparanda FF just across the Kaupunginlahti lake – only a couple of kilometres as the crow flies. The two sides play regular friendlies. It’s also worth mentioning that should Bundesliga side Freiburg qualify for next season’s Europa League, they could potentially face Basel (67km away) and/or Strasbourg (84km away) in close-range cross-border fixtures. Away from Europe, strong candidates may well be Brazzaville’s Stade Alphonse Massamba-Debat in Congo, home of Cara Brazzaville and Étoile du Congo, and the Stade des Martyrs in Kinshasa, DR Congo, home of AS Vita Club and DC Motema Pembe – the grounds are just a 15km journey apart. And before we leave the subject we should probably mention the thorny issue of Chester, an English club whose pitch is in Wales – the border runs through the ticket office and car park. The Airfield, home of former Welsh Premier side Airbus UK Broughton, is just a 6.6km walk away over the River Dee. Any more for any more? Have we overlooked some even closer international neighbours? Send your efforts to knowledge@theguardian.com A few of you cited a higher class of journeyman, former Uruguay striker Diego Forlan. “He started his professional career not in his home country but in Argentina for Independiente,” writes Chris Page. “He later played for Manchester United, Villarreal, Atlético Madrid, Internazionale, Internacional of Brazil and eventually Penarol in Uruguay. He also spent a period on trial at Nancy in France when he was a teenager, so had he played a first-team game we’d have been up to seven with just Germany outstanding.” Ben Entwistle suggested another South American – former “new Maradona” Andrés D’Alessandro. He played for River Plate and San Lorenzo (Argentina), Wolfsburg (Germany), Portsmouth (England), Zaragoza (Spain), Internacional (Brazil) and Nacional (Uruguay). Can anyone beat that? If so, get in touch. “England still has teams in all three European competitions. Back in the day, did any nation ever win the European Cup, Cup Winners’ Cup and Uefa Cup in the same season,” asks James Funnell. We alluded to this in a column a few years ago, but haven’t answered James’s specific question. It has happened only once, in 1989-90, when Serie A ruled the world. Or at least Europe. Milan retained the European Cup, Sampdoria won the Cup Winners’ Cup and Juventus beat Fiorentina in an all-Italian Uefa Cup final. Serie A’s dominance was such that it almost happened on two other occasions. In 1988-89 Milan won the European Cup, Napoli won the Uefa Cup and Sampdoria lost in the final of the Cup Winners’ Cup. Four years later Parma won the Cup Winners’ Cup and Juventus the Uefa Cup, but Milan were beaten by Marseille in the Champions League final. The closest England came was probably the 1980-81 season. Liverpool won the European Cup and Ipswich the Uefa Cup, but West Ham let the side down when they were pummelled by Dinamo Tblisi in the quarter-finals of the Cup Winners’ Cup. There was also a near miss for Spain in 1961-62. Atlético Madrid won the Cup Winners’ Cup, Valencia beat Barcelona in the final of the Fairs Cup (a forerunner of the Uefa Cup) – but Real Madrid were beaten by Benfica in the final of the European Cup. “The Comoros National Team are known as the Coelacanths,” wrote Robert Abushal in April 2013. “Do they have the most endangered nickname in world football?” Certainly we should spare a thought for the Coelacanths, both the fish species currently listed as Critically Threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature list and the team at No 192 on Fifa’s world rankings list (although things have improved since). And, despite a lengthy trawl through the IUCN archives, we’re struggling to find any team nicknamed after a species so endangered. “As someone bestowed with the relatively rare spelling of the forename Allan, I take a keen interest in the careers of Everton’s Allan and Newcastle’s Allan Saint-Maximin. I am firmly of the opinion that us Allans should look out for each other. I was therefore somewhat disheartened to see Everton’s Brazilian midfield enforcer given a red card for an outrageous, cynical lunge on Newcastle’s mercurial French forward. Are there any other examples of namesake red cards?” asks Allan Leith. “I saw a stat this week saying that Luka Modric has played in 44.5% of all Croatia’s international games. On quick research, I found one player who can beat that (Fatos Beciraj of Montenegro at 63.4%) but is there anyone else who can say they’ve played in an even higher percentage of their nation’s international games?” asks Richard Wilson. “Has any player scored the first goal in more than one new stadium?” – Randy Gatley. “Over the past year or so I’ve noticed a trend for players hopping two or three hops as they come on to a pitch, either at the start/second half, or when coming on as a sub.

3/23/2022,"On 24 March last year, hundreds of police officers descended on Los Angeles’ Echo Park Lake to evict the community of unhoused residents that had swelled there during the pandemic. After police arrested protesters opposing the evictions and cleared the encampment at the popular city park, the local councilman pushing for the sweep said his office had found “housing solutions” for roughly 200 of the displaced residents, calling it the “single largest housing event in the history of the city”. One year later, however, government records tell a different story: out of 183 unhoused people who were removed from the park and tracked by the county’s homelessness agency, just 17 are confirmed to be in longer term housing. Nearly 50 are in temporary shelter waiting for stable housing. The rest either returned to the streets or disappeared from the county’s tracking systems. LA’s failure to get permanent housing for the vast majority of unhoused people forced out of the park is documented in a new report by researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles who obtained housing data and shared their findings with the Guardian. Their analysis, co-authored by former park residents, concluded that although some displaced residents were eager to get indoors, the temporary shelters they initially landed in had strict regulations that stripped people of basic freedoms and caused many to leave or be kicked out. People who lasted in the temporary programs said they’ve been unable to transition to long-term housing as officials had promised, the researchers found. Ultimately, one year after the eviction, many were back on the streets, often living in worse conditions than they did before. The report’s findings come as cities across California are increasingly cracking down on tent encampments in response to complaints from voters frustrated with the state’s seemingly intractable homelessness crisis. LA has banned camping at hundreds of locations in recent months, even though more than half a million residents lack access to affordable housing. Sacramento’s mayor has proposed obligating unhoused people to accept the shelter offered to them, which would pave the way for sweeps of people who decline. And the California governor is pushing for a court system to force some unhoused people into treatment. “They didn’t give us what they said they would, and I’m outside still,” said Victor Monarque, 35, who lived at Echo Park and says he has been unable to get permanent housing or stable shelter since the encampment’s closure. This month, he slept in a van, he said. “The city shuts these encampments down because people don’t like how they look,” he added. “But this is a public park that should be for everybody, and they should’ve just left these fucking people alone.” Like other encampments across LA, the unhoused community at Echo Park, a 29-acre (11 hectare) city park near downtown known for its majestic fountain and swan boats, grew significantly during the pandemic as sweeps were paused. “I felt safe at Echo Park,” said Queen, 33, who lived at the park and became a prominent community organizer. The park had been part of her life for decades. Queen, whom the Guardian is identifying by her nickname, was born in Mexico and came to the neighborhood as a baby. Her mother worked as a street vendor selling corn. “Growing up here, the park meant freedom to me. It was the one time we were allowed to be children, to play.” Queen said she became unhoused after facing large medical expenses from a car accident in 2019. She felt protected at the Echo Park encampment, she said, which had hundreds of campers and had a community kitchen and garden, a job program, and showers. The park regularly drew volunteers who dropped off hygiene supplies, meals and other resources. Life at the camp brought the hardships that come with sleeping outside, including conflicts, struggles with mental illness and addiction. But to Queen and others, the site provided safety and resources hard to find elsewhere. “We had a community, and people looked after each other,” said Cesar Segura, 32, also known as Wall Street, who lived at the park and is Queen’s fiancee. City officials, led by the district councilman, Mitch O’Farrell, moved to close the park and the encampment in March 2021. They pointed to complaints by neighborhood groups of unsanitary conditions, reports of violence, overdoses and several deaths in the encampment and the need for repairs and upgrades to the children’s play area and other facilities in the park. In the weeks after the encampment eviction, which LAPD spent more than $2m to enforce, O’Farrell, LA Mayor Eric Garcetti, and other officials declared the operation a success, saying they had taken a “compassionate” approach and the city had offered housing “placements” to all residents. O’Farrell initially claimed that more than 200 people were moved into shelter. Data from the Los Angeles Homeless Services authority (Lahsa), the lead county agency responsible for coordinating housing and services, and reviewed by UCLA, showed, however, that the actual number of people served was lower and that for many, the placements were fleeting or nonexistent. UCLA’s review of the data indicated that: Lahsa tracked 183 people who were living at the park, although advocates say the actual number of residents was higher. As of 9 February, the agency has lost track of 97 of the 183 people it monitored. Of those 97 people, 15 never received initial placements, and 29 left programs after less than a month. Out of the remaining people 15 were confirmed to have returned to homelessness; 48 are in temporary shelter programs waiting for housing placements and six have left the county programs for other settings such as jails or hospitals. Just 17 people are confirmed to be living in some form of longer term housing. The UCLA researchers could locate only four people in housing, two of whom are Queen and Segura. The couple said they were only able to secure an apartment because Queen got hired at a housing nonprofit group after her activism at the encampment. Six people have died, the researchers found. “The few times we’ve seen success is when people get housing through their own community networks,” said Ananya Roy, director of the UCLA Luskin Institute. When sweeps are the driving force of policy, outreach efforts are doomed to fail, she argued. Annie Powers, co-author of the report, said their research led them to conclude it doesn’t really matter to the city of LA what happens to its unhoused population, as long as they are not camping: “It’s about eliminating people from public space much more than it is about ‘housing’,” they said. “So many people just fall out of the system entirely,” they said. “It’s a systematic disappearance of people.” The reasons behind LA’s failure to land unhoused people into permanent housing are multifold and complex. The majority of Echo Park campers who were placed ended up at facilities run through Project Roomkey, a state program launched at the start of the pandemic to get motel rooms for unhoused people and overseen by Lahsa in LA. Although residents said they were initially thrilled to have a private room indoors, once they entered, they found strict rules and curfews controlling when they could come and go, and regulations banning visitors, which isolated them from their communities and families. The rules made it hard for people to get back on their feet and continue their jobs or find work, leading some to get kicked out while others chose to return to the streets. Some who have lasted at Roomkey and subsequently received housing vouchers, which partially subsidize rents for very low-income people, said they were unable to find landlords that will take them. Donald Smith, a 37-year-old veteran, became unhoused after losing his job at a restaurant at the start of the pandemic. He moved to Echo Park because he had friends there and said it felt safer than any other encampment. When outreach workers offered him a spot at Project Roomkey before the shutdown, he quickly accepted and jumped in a bus: “I was extremely excited. I left everything I had in my tent there because I was just glad to be off the street, with a roof over my head and electricity.” But at his site, the LA Grand Hotel, which was run by the Salvation Army, staff frequently searched his belongings, which he said was frustrating. Rules requiring him to be in his room for check-ins three times a day interfered with his food service job. Though it felt like a “glamorized jail”, he said, he stayed in the program for more than a year because he believed it would lead to a voucher for long-term housing. Earlier this month, however, he was kicked out, he said, after he missed a check-in and staff found mushrooms in his room that he had been growing from spores he bought online. He said he had previously gotten in trouble for having cannabis, which he uses to help with PTSD. Smith is now back outside, camping with two unhoused friends inside a makeshift structure in a vacant lot, about a mile from downtown. “This is the worst shit that ever happened to me,” he said. “I thought I was never going to have to be homeless again after I moved in to Project Roomkey.” On a recent windy afternoon, he pointed to ashes from a fire that had recently broke out next to their camping spot, while his friends tried to secure their tarp structure blowing in the strong winds. Since Smith left Roomkey and is no longer in contact with Lahsa, he has approached another nonprofit organization to try to get a voucher: “I’m starting all over again.” The Salvation Army, declined to comment on his account. Gustavo Otzoy, 55, who lived at the lake and is now part of the research collective behind the report, said that he agreed to leave the park because of the promise of a Roomkey spot. But after he left, he was told there were no immediate openings: “They wanted to get me out of the park, and I took their deal. They lied to me, and it really devastated me.” Volunteers with Street Watch LA paid for a hotel room for him the first week after the eviction, but he later ended up sleeping in another park, before finally getting into Roomkey. But at Roomkey, he said he was not allowed to keep his tools, which impeded his work as a handyman, and he hated how staff would enter his room without permission: “How come they call it Project Roomkey when they don’t even give you keys?” He eventually was kicked out of the program. Some former Echo Park residents who are still in Roomkeysaid they are anxious to move on to permanent housing, a feeling that is exacerbated by their constant fear of getting kicked out of their current rooms: “The housing that they claim exists does not exist,” said Will Sens Jr, 45. In September of last year, he and other Roomkey residents got notices under their doors saying they would have to leave the program in 30 days – notices which were later rescinded. “It’s scary to not have any stability. They’ll kick people out for nothing, all the time. It’s horrible,” said Sens. “Project Roomkey didn’t need to be this way,” said Hilary Malson, another UCLA researcher. “Evicting people from the community and sanctuary they built up to then put them into a carceral system, with hotels set up like detention centers, is just a staggering failure of state policy – you have them further traumatized, further violated, further displaced and evicted again and stripped of their rights.” She noted that many unhoused people have experienced repeated forms of displacement – first evicted from their homes, then the park, then a county shelter program. When she can’t track down someone she has been interviewing, she’ll check the coroner’s records “just to give myself some reassurance that they’re alive”. Colleen Murphy, Lahsa’s associate director for unsheltered strategies, said Roomkey operators have tried to strike a balance between “creating a low-barrier environment, but also keeping the space safe”, adding that if people don’t last in temporary programs, Lahsa tries to find other ways to get them housed. “The challenge for our whole system is that getting people indoors is just the first step. We really need to get people into permanent spaces, because homes end homelessness. And our system has a shortage of permanent, affordable housing.” Lahsa’s “best practices” for street encampments dictate that outreach workers have ample time to build relationships, Murphy added. The “very stressful” environment at Echo Park before the closure date likely resulted in people falling through the cracks, she said: “There was a lot of working happening without a lot of time. The more time we have to work with somebody, and doing that where it’s not under duress, you’re going to have better outcomes.” She said it was possible some who disappeared from the county’s tracking were able to find a way out of homelessness. “But I don’t think anyone would point to Echo Park as something we’d want to repeat,” she added. A spokesperson for O’Farrell defended the park closure in an 11 March email. “Our team works to use a comprehensive, compassionate approach – led by services and outreach – to get people experiencing homelessness into safe, secure, managed environments and on the path to wellness and stability”, Dan Halden said. “There is nothing compassionate about enabling human beings to live and die in squalor on city streets, sidewalks, public parks, and public spaces.” Harrison Wollman, a spokesperson for Mayor Garcetti, said in an email the city still considered the operation a success, because it showed “we can transition whole encampments into shelter quickly and humanely”. But, he added, the data revealing a lack of housing placements “affirm a truth we’ve long known: that shelter does not end homelessness by itself. That’s why we must also continue investing in long-term solutions like permanent housing.” City officials have since reopened Echo Park Lake, but put in place a large fence around the perimeter and other restrictions meant to prevent camping. “It feels like I’m looking at the Mona Lisa – the park is such a beauty and a wonder, but it’s not really there,” said Queen, noting that the street vendors can’t enter the park anymore. “It’s more like a ghost town. They took away the heart of the community … It’s like no one won. Yeah, you got no homeless there, but you got no people there either.” “To me, it’s a private park now,” added Otzoy, who helped put up flyers last June calling for the fence to be taken down. In the process, he was arrested and pinned to the ground, accused of “vandalism”. His charges were eventually dismissed, but the arrest resulted in a new condition of parole from a previous case: He is banned from entering the park. It used to be one of his favorite places, he said. Now he doesn’t know when he’ll be able to return.",News/US news,"LA promised housing for residents of tent city but dramatically failed, report reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/los-angeles-echo-park-unhoused-residents-homelessness
3/23/2022,"Ukraine’s former president Petro Poroshenko has asked Boris Johnson not to compare the UK’s Brexit vote to his country’s fight against Russia, saying “zero” citizens died because of the decision to leave the European Union. Johnson’s comparison, when he suggested British people backed Brexit with 52% of the vote because, like the Ukrainians, they choose “freedom every time”, was greeted with disbelief. Downing Street has denied the prime minister was seeking to make a direct comparison between the devastation and loss of life in Ukraine and the UK vote to leave the EU. Asked by ITV News about the comparison, Poroshenko, speaking in military uniform from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, responded: “How many citizens of United Kingdom died because of Brexit? Zero. “Can you imagine how many Ukrainians died [when] they met Putin aggression? Only today we have 150 children killed by Russian soldiers and by Russian artillery. Only during the last week 2,000 children from Mariupol were captured and delivered back to Russia. “Can I ask you how many houses were destroyed because of Brexit?

When the British people voted for Brexit in such large numbers, I don’t believe it was remotely because they were remotely hostile to foreigners; it was because they wanted to be free.” The remark was heavily criticised, including by some in the Tory ranks, while Labour has called on Johnson to apologise to both Ukrainians and Britons. Poroshenko, who was president of Ukraine from 2014 to 2019, called for British offers of support to be delivered faster and sooner. He told ITV News: “Your hypersonic anti-aircraft system, which Prime Minister Johnson just a few days ago promised us we will receive – that will be the only possible way to stop Russian missile technology. “Please, you promised it one week ago, they need to be here now.

3/23/2022,"The lowest temperature recorded in the UK on Monday was -7.8C, at the village of Braemar in the Cairngorms. Much of Britain has had a sun-kissed few days, however, and in the Cornish town of Bude the temperature at one stage hit 17.7C – nevertheless at Taunton and the Ageas Bowl cricketers still pulled on their long-sleeve cable knits as they headed out for the first domestic friendlies of 2022. A new season is upon us, the start of the County Championship just a fortnight away. They may be defending champions but Warwickshire approach the new campaign third in the bookies’ estimations, behind Essex and the narrow favourites, Lancashire. As those frosty friendlies began last year’s runners-up might not have been in action but they would have been feeling the chill particularly sharply, having returned only on Sunday from a pre-season warm-weather training camp in Dubai – undertaken, for the first time, together with Lancashire’s women’s team. Having narrowly missed out on the title last year in a dramatic final week they seem ready to push on, with ambitions also for the Royal London One-Day Cup: “We’re looking at both competitions and thinking there’s no reason why we can’t win both,” says Mark Chilton, the former player and longtime coach who was promoted last September to director of cricket performance at Old Trafford. “Last year will have got some useful experience into lots of people, getting close [in the County Championship], but also a lot of people felt we were capable of winning and there was more than a tinge of disappointment that we didn’t,” says Chilton, who will combine his new role with his duties as assistant coach. “I think we knew we were capable of being champions last year, and therefore you feel the group is significantly motivated to go one step better. The depth in our squad as well is something I feel pretty confident about – with the uncertainty that exists with the best players, you never quite know who’s going to get taken off you and I feel like we’ve got quite a lot of bases covered if we lose different types of player. At this stage I wouldn’t put us favourites but I’d certainly say we’re confident about what we’re capable of achieving.” Since last summer Lancashire have snaffled Phil Salt from Sussex – Salt didn’t play a first-class game in 2021 as he established himself as a white-ball batter of international renown but according to Chilton “has communicated his real desire to impact four-day cricket” – and this week announced the Pakistan bowler Hasan Ali had signed up to play the first six matches of the County Championship. There are also high hopes for George Bell, a wicketkeeper-batsman who was part of the England team that reached the Under-19 World Cup final in Antigua last month and is going into his first season as a professional. “He hugely impressed out in Dubai,” Chilton says. “He’s a very focused and ambitious individual and looks a fine player.” But while both Salt and Bell have represented England in the West Indies this year it is a player who has not made that trip who will inevitably be the focus of greatest attention. When they last won the County Championship in 2011 Jimmy Anderson managed only two appearances, but with his international future currently uncertain he may be seen more frequently at Old Trafford this summer. “Obviously it’s a highly sensitive area at the minute and he’s in a slight predicament about where he sits,” Chilton says. “We obviously go a long way back and we’re able to air that situation quite openly and at the minute I see as motivated a Jimmy Anderson as I’ve ever seen. I think the primary goal for him is he wants his name on the team sheet for the first Test of the summer, but he’s openly talked about playing for Lancashire and helping us win a championship and knowing him as I do I wouldn’t expect anything else. “We play six games in six weeks at the start of the season so we’ve got to manage your bowlers through that period, but I’d be hopeful that he certainly plays three of those first six, and then we see how things play out. We know the quality he’s going to bring when he plays for us. That’s never been in doubt whenever he’s put a red rose on his chest.” Wherever they finish this season Lancashire have already claimed one first, their trip to Dubai being the first joint men’s and women’s tour undertaken by a first-class county, with the club sponsors Emirates and Hilton both helping to make it happen. “Whether we can manage it financially every year might be a challenge but I think it would certainly be something we’d consider again, because it felt like a real success,” Chilton says. “Sometimes [those involved in the two teams] sort of cross like ships in the night a little bit, you’re busy in your own jobs and you don’t get time just to sit and talk to people. I think the way the men and the women integrated was just a really healthy thing for the club. As assistant coach of the men’s team for a number of years I’ve tended to be absorbed in that, so I actually hadn’t watched a huge amount of women’s cricket until we went on this tour. Now I think we’re all more invested in it, because we’re aware of who the people are. I think from that respect it was a huge positive.” Lancashire move into the next stage of their preparations with a two-day friendly at Derbyshire starting on Thursday. “It does feel early, with frost on my car this morning, but everyone’s just pretty keen to wrap themselves up and get going,” Chilton says. “You sense that the squad knows that they’re a good squad, and they’re a strong squad, and I think they’re a competitive squad as well. They want to win, and you can really sense that.”  This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.
