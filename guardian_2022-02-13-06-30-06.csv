2/13/2022,"The anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe returned to her local supermarket on Saturday for the first time since her tweets about the increasing price of groceries went viral to find that her campaign had been successful. The activist has been urging supermarkets to make the cheapest food ranges more widely available after highlighting the inflation in products such as rice and value ranges being removed from shelves in her local Asda in Shoeburyness, Essex, last month. She tweeted that in January 2021 the cheapest pasta was 29p for 500g. It had increased to 70p amid the cost of living crisis.  Monroe also highlighted that the cheapest rice in the Asda branch in January 2021 was 45p for a 1kg bag which had increased to £1 for 500g. She tweeted on Saturday that a pasta bag was available for 29p and rice had returned to 45p for a kilogram bag. The campaigner also posted pictures of baked bean tins and canned spaghetti which had returned to last year’s prices. She tweeted: “I’ve cried in supermarkets plenty in the last 10 years. Putting back jam that had crept up by sixpence, meaning SB and I faced a week of bone dry toast. Trying to work out what to put back, what to do without, out of a tenner’s worth of groceries that weren’t enough to start with. “I’ve cried tears of humiliation when a shelf-edge label turned out to be advertising an expired promotion, tipping my shopping over what I could afford from the six pounds or so in change – the only money I had in the world – in my hand. “And today I cried, quietly, to myself, in Asda, as the enormity of all of the last few weeks finally sank in among all the white labels in my shopping basket. “So I guess I just wanted to say thanks to everyone at Asda who has worked really hard over the last few weeks to bring the missing Smart Price products back.” In an article for the Observer last month, Monroe wrote that she was launching her own price index alongside a team of economists, charitable partners, anti-poverty campaigners, retail price analysts and former staff from the Office for National Statistics to document “the disappearance of the budget lines and the insidiously creeping prices of the most basic versions of essential items at the supermarket.” The campaigner, who has given evidence to parliamentary inquiries and been consulted on the School Food Plan and the National Food Strategy, added: “And today, I could put extra treats in my shopping basket for SB. Today, I managed to get so much in my £20 basket that I was clutching rice and oats and muesli to my bosom as I wrestled to the checkout. Today is the happiest shopping experience in over a decade. “The turnaround for this has been almost immediate – the speed at which they responded, not just with words, but with exactly what they said they would do – has been absolutely remarkable.” It comes after Asda on Monday committed to making its cheapest food ranges more widely available after Monroe’s social media campaign. The retailer said it had taken onboard Monroe’s comments and would stock its full Smart Price and Farm Stores ranges in all 581 food stores and online, increasing the number of customers who have access to the products. Meg Farren, Asda’s chief customer officer, said on Monday: “We want to help our customers’ budgets stretch further and have taken onboard the comments about the availability of our Smart Price range made by Jack Monroe.”",News/Business,‘Thanks to everyone at Asda’: success for anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/12/thanks-to-everyone-at-asda-success-for-anti-poverty-campaigner-jack-monroe
2/13/2022,"The sky over Los Angeles is forecast to be clear and blue and the temperature around 30C when the Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Rams run out for Super Bowl LVI on Sunday. It should be a chance for the NFL to celebrate weathering Covid‑19 with television ratings up 10% from 2020, as well as an opportunity to pay tribute to the greatest Super Bowl champion of all time, Tom Brady, who has announced his retirement after seven championships and 10 trips to the big game. But this is the NFL, which often appears closer to a soap opera than a sports league. On the day Brady signalled the end of his career, the league duly delivered its latest plot twist. As is often the case in the league and the US as a whole, it had much to do with race and inequality: Brian Flores, the former head coach of the Miami Dolphins, filed a lawsuit claiming the league “is racially segregated and is managed much like a plantation”.  Flores, who is Black, was fired by the Dolphins in January despite the team posting a second straight winning season for the first time since 2003. The lack of minority head coaches in a league with nearly 70% of players are Black has long been a point of criticism. The NFL’s Rooney rule, which states that teams must interview at least one minority candidate for major coaching vacancies, has done little to correct that deficiency. When the rule was introduced there were three Black head coaches in the NFL; on the day Flores filed the lawsuit there was one. The NFL quickly denied that its multibillion annual revenue is built on plantation dynamics – that is, rich white men profiting from the bodies of young Black men. But at his annual pre-Super Bowl address the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, admitted work needs to be done. “We have to continue to look and find and step back and say: ‘We’re not doing a good enough job here.’ We need to find better solutions and better outcomes. “Let’s find more effective policies. Let’s make sure everyone understands. Let’s make sure that we’re looking at diversity and incentivizing that for everybody in our building.” CINCINNATI BENGALS Super Bowl titles: 0 Super Bowl appearance: Third Record this regular season: 10-7 Key player: Joe Burrow, quarterback. The quarterback has a cool head and is tough for opponents to bring down. Has brilliant chemistry with his top receiver Ja’Marr Chase who was also his teammate in college LOS ANGELES RAMS Super Bowl titles: 1 (As St Louis Rams) Super Bowl appearance: Fifth (including two as St Louis) Record this regular season: 12-5 Key player: Aaron Donald, defensive tackle. The most talented player on the field is a one-man wrecking crew when he’s on form, which is nearly every game. Stopping him will be crucial for a Bengals victory. The problem is that no one is quite sure what the solution is. Goodell cannot tell the ultra-rich owners – the “poorest” of whom is worth a mere $500m – who to employ. The owners know money will continue to roll in regardless of who coaches their teams. Flores’s lawsuit contained another barb, though. He alleges he was offered bonuses to lose games in order to secure higher picks in the NFL draft, something the Dolphins vigorously deny. It is an open secret teams often fail to field competitive rosters as they rebuild. But offering coaches money to lose is a different story and, if proven to be true, would hit the integrity of a league that has been tarnished by players’ brain trauma and its handling of the anthem protests started by Colin Kaepernick. These mostly self-inflicted problems distract from what will be an intriguing match. The home town Rams, packed with stars on offense and defense, are the slight favourites in the $5bn SoFi Stadium, a beautiful arena that will also host the opening ceremony of the 2028 Olympics. The Bengals are in their first Super Bowl for 33 years and were the worst team in the NFL two seasons ago. Few outside Cincinnati thought they would beat the talented Kansas City Chiefs to reach the Super Bowl, but they did so thanks to a superb performance from their defense and the cool head of their 25-year-old quarterback Joe Burrow, who has drawn early comparisons to Brady. Neither man has been the fastest or strongest player on the field but they find a way to win and deliver at the right time. Happily for their bank balances, they share the swagger and clean-cut good looks that sponsors find irresistible. It is unlikely Burrow will ever get anywhere near Brady’s record seven Super Bowl titles. But an upset win would be a good start – and a nice distraction for the NFL from its troubles.",Sport/Sport,Brian Flores’s racism lawsuit leaves Super Bowl struggling for attention,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/12/brian-flores-racism-lawsuit-cincinnati-bengals-los-angeles-rams-super-bowl
2/13/2022,"The ghosts of Albertville 92 are twitching. It is 30 years since Great Britain returned from a Winter Games without a single medal and more than 20 since the money taps began to flood across Olympic sport. But suddenly a nation used to every Games bringing ever greater glories – and stories– is starting to notice an alien sensation: potential failure.  Team GB arrived in Beijing confident they would win between three and seven medals. They still might. But as each gold-plated opportunity slips by – a loose curling stone here, a mistimed snowboard turn there – the sense of nervousness grows. Having talked a good game, they increasingly resemble a gambler on tilt, desperate for any kind of win. On Saturday there was more pain as Britain’s skeleton sliders, who had won a medal at every Games since 2002, were so far off the pace that if it was horse racing there would have been a steward’s inquiry. Brogan Crowley, tipped as a future star, finished 22nd out of 25 competitors while Laura Deas, a bronze medallist four years ago, was 19th. “I’m sorry I couldn’t deliver something better for you,” said Deas, fighting back the tears. “The speed that I so desperately want is not there, and there’s nothing I can do about that now.” What made these results even more puzzling is that Team GB athletes consistently made better starts than the German gold medallist Hannah Neise. But a combination of poor driving and a strangely slow sled meant they were soon propping up the rear. So what is behind Britain’s poor performance? Part of it is simple variance. A small number of medal prospects, combined with many winter events being highly chaotic, is a recipe for unpredictability – good or bad. And in Beijing it has so far been bad. Some Team GB staff insist that getting a medal under your belt early builds momentum. What if Britain’s world champion mixed curlers had continued their good start in their semi-final against Norway? Or if world No 1 Charlotte Bankes had not made a mistake in the snowboard cross? Britain could easily be sitting on two medals and hearts would be still, not beating uneasily. The impact of Covid is another factor. Around 60% of Britain’s 50-strong squad spend large parts of their year abroad. Having less time to train on snow and ice due to travel restrictions inevitably hurts. But for some insiders there is a more troublesome issue: a fear that Team GB has lost its tech advantage. Take skeleton. For years it has benefited from superior helmets, aerodynamic skin suits and fast sleds. But in Beijing their new in-house designed sled has appeared more Lada than Mercedes. Ironically the silver and bronze medallists, from Australia and the Netherlands, were on British-made Kristian Bromley sleds. Others in UK Sport believe the organisation has never completely replaced Scott Drawer, their former head of research and innovation for more than a decade until 2013. It was Drawer who was responsible for using applied science, medicine and engineering projects to help Team GB – and was far ahead of his time in bringing advanced aerodynamic expertise into Olympic sport. Notably when Drawer departed the innovation programme was moved out of UK Sport and into the English Institute of Sport with mixed results. The EIS got a lot more cash and staff. However, there have been some notable white elephants. Before the Sochi Winter Olympics, for instance, more than £500,000 was wasted on building a state-of-the-art bobsleigh – with the help of F1’s McLaren – that was not considered good enough to be used for the 2014 Games. As one squad member told the Guardian, when it was given back to the team by McLaren in October 2013, it had to be re-engineered because it was found to be too small to fit in all four men. Even after that the widespread feeling in the camp was that it was “rubbish” and “substandard”. The sled used by Britain’s athletes in Beijing is said to be a work in progress. With a few tweaks maybe it will one day fire GB to more medals. However so far the signs are not entirely encouraging. An urgent question for skeleton remains: if GB has no tech advantage to help it win low-hanging fruit, why should it enjoy £6.4m in funding over the Olympic cycle – especially when there are no tracks in the country? Yet some perspective is needed. A week remains. Team GB can still emerge with medals. On Monday, the brilliant 17-year-old Kirsty Muir goes in the women’s freestyle skiing slopestyle. On Wednesday Dave Ryding, the 35-year-old slalom skier, has his fourth attempt at an Olympic medal. The men’s two and four-man bobsleigh teams could yet win a medal. The men’s curling – and perhaps the women too – almost certainly will. There have also been performances here – such as Muir and figure skaters Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson – that are surely building blocks for the Turin 2026 Games. A setback in Beijing will not be the end of the world. It might encourage UK Sport to ask what it can do better. Finding better ways to tackle the chronic lack of diversity in Britain’s Olympic teams is long overdue. So is deepening the talent pool and finding new ways to define success that goes beyond mere medals. But perhaps some of this is on us too. As a nation we have gorged on Olympic medal success for so long that we have forgotten what it is like to stumble, to fall short – and, yes, to get back on your feet.",Sport/Sport,Team GB face prospect of returning empty-handed from Beijing Games,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/12/team-gb-face-prospect-of-returning-empty-handed-from-beijing-games
