4/11/2022,"Ali Harbi Ali’s descent to extremism followed an otherwise unremarkable childhood. Born in Southwark, London, in 1996 to Somali parents, Ali grew up in a three-bedroom 1980s terrace house in Croydon with his mother, two sisters and younger brother. His father, Harbi Ali Kullane, was a former communications adviser to the prime minister of Somalia, who moved to the UK from Mogadishu in the 1990s. Ali’s parents split when he was young and his father began to divide his time between London and east Africa. He is reported to have homes in Mogadishu and Nairobi in Kenya. Ali and his two younger sisters and brother were among the first Muslim families to attend Parish Church junior and infant school in Croydon. Former staff have told reporters how, as a small boy, he would cheerfully join in singing hymns in assembly. He later went to the same secondary school as the model Kate Moss: Riddlesdown Collegiate school in Purley, south London. He is said to have excelled academically in his first five years at the school. He stayed on for A-levels and his intention was to study medicine at university. Friends have told reporters he would spend every break playing football. He was not particularly popular but nor was he a loner, it has been suggested. It was later in his education years that he is said to have taken a turn towards extremist views, and during sixth form, his school work and attendance began to decline. It is now known that he received extensive support under the government’s Channel counter-terrorism programme before his case was closed. He was first referred to Prevent, the early intervention scheme designed to turn people away from the risk of supporting violence, as a teenager in 2014. Each year a small proportion of the thousands referred to Prevent are then referred on to the Channel programme for intensive support, overseen by a panel with expertise in deradicalisation and helping those deemed vulnerable to being drawn into terrorism. Both programmes are voluntary and do not involve criminal sanctions. Ali was referred to the Channel scheme while he was at school in 2014 over concerns about him being drawn towards an Islamist ideology. He went through the process and was discharged. He was not believed to be on any of the security services’ watchlists. His A-level results were not as expected: two Ds and an E. It was agreed he would stay at school to resit his examinations. He left school in 2015 having retaken his biology A-level. Later that year, he enrolled at City University for a degree in radiotherapy. But records indicate he withdrew from the course on 22 September 2016 for “personal reasons”. He told police he dropped out of university to focus on whether or not he was going to make hijrah – migrate to Muslim lands – or focus on carrying out an act of domestic terrorism. Family and friends have told reporters Ali started to watch extremist videos online, including those posted by the notorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary. After his arrest for the murder of David Amess, searches of his mobile phone and laptop devices found plenty of extremist material. Images of terrorist attackers and “inspirational” Islamic State (IS) propaganda images were found. One mobile phone had been used since 2016 to receive messages that appeared to be official IS propaganda and communications via a channel on the encrypted Telegram app. Ali’s father told reporters he was “traumatised” by his son’s actions. Known to international diplomats in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, Kullane was involved in several anti-terrorist campaigns against the jihadist group al-Shabaab while working for the prime minister. Kullane returned to the UK two years ago. He lives with his sister in the north London district of Bounds Green. Ali had been living with an aunt and her sons in a council house in the upmarket north London Kentish Town area, in a street of £2m three-storey townhouses. It emerged Ali had researched attacks on other MPs, including the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove. He had also looked at Mike Freer MP’s website and Wikipedia pages for the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and Richard Fuller MP.",News/UK news,Ali Harbi Ali: an academic high flyer who fell into extremism,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/ali-harbi-ali-an-academic-high-flyer-who-fell-into-extremism-david-amess
4/11/2022,"On a recent trip to Mexico I was reminded of the country’s astonishing variety of wild herbs and greens. Handfuls of different ones are used to flavour and colour broths, soups and corn doughs (which are used to make the likes of tamales). This herby green rice recipe has long been a favourite– it looks fabulous on a Lenten table spilling out of a whole chicken. Try different herbs in the puree – any mix of wild garlic, dill, tarragon and parsley would taste wonderful. I only use one ancho chilli if I am feeding this to the whole family, but try two if you like a little heat. Aleppo chilli flakes make a suitable substitution if you can’t find ancho. Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 20 minServes 6-8 For the chicken250g long-grain rice120g spinachA small bunch of corianderA large handful of wild garlic (or 2 fat garlic cloves, peeled)1 large onion, peeled and roughly chopped500ml chicken stock or water2 tbsp olive oil1 large chicken, at room temperature For the ancho butter1-2 ancho chillies, or 1-2 tsp aleppo chilli flakes2 fat garlic cloves70g butter, at room temperature1 handful fresh oregano (or thyme), leaves stripped and roughly chopped Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Soak the rice in cold water for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, wash the spinach, coriander and wild garlic (if using). Shake them dry. Blitz with the onion, and if using, garlic cloves, in a food processor, using 100ml of the stock to loosen it into a vivid green puree. Heat a large, deep saute pan over a medium heat and add the oil. Add the greens and stir-fry for a minute or two. Drain the rice and add to the pan, stirring well. Now add the rest of the stock, season generously and simmer for 15 minutes until the rice is a little under-cooked – not raw, but still retaining some bite. It will continue to cook a little in the oven. While the rice is cooking, de-stalk and de-seed the ancho chilli, tear into a few pieces and cover in boiling water. Leave to soften for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, smash the garlic and oregano together in a pestle or small food processor with a teaspoon of salt. Drain the ancho and add it to the garlic and oregano. Blitz to a paste before adding the butter. Mix well. Loosen the skin from the chicken all over the breast and thighs and smear the butter underneath. Put it in a roasting tray and stuff the cavity with the green rice, allowing what doesn’t fit inside to spill out into the tray. Pour the wine into the tray and roast for 50-60 minutes, until golden on the top and the juices run clear when the thighs are pierced with a skewer. (If you allow 15 minutes per 500g of bird plus 15 minutes you should be right). Serve with a plate of green vegetables or salad on the side. Instead of chicken, this recipe is delicious if you stuff a few hollowed-out squashes with the rice, and slather them in the ancho butter before roasting.

4/11/2022,"It’s impossible to watch this absorbing documentary about anti-Putin dissident Alexei Navalny without a terrible suspicion entering your mind: did Putin order his grotesque Ukraine invasion because of Navalny? Was it a diversionary tactic against the huge, growing wave of protest spearheaded by Navalny who, in 2021, had defiantly returned to Russia from German exile and whose instant arrest and imprisonment merely fanned the flames of his international celebrity? Putin was no doubt deeply enraged by this social-media megastar who had not only survived a Novichok assassination attempt but then humiliated the Kremlin by unmasking his malign and cack-handed would-be killers online. Navalny is an extraordinary figure in many ways: approachable, telegenic and easygoing. Or mostly easygoing, anyway: he can still sound irritable and defensive when questioned about his appearances on the same stage as extreme Russian nationalists about 10 years earlier, and perhaps this film could have looked harder at the facts of Navalny’s early life. But the real eye-opener is the interview with the Bulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grosev of the website Bellingcat who managed such breathtaking feats of detection on Navalny’s behalf in finding the FSB assailants. Grosev is all about data: by getting hold of passenger manifests, travel details or call records – and everything digital leaves a trace – he can put together an objective picture, even retrieving the culprits’ passport photos. It is quite staggering. And Navalny’s story has a particular resonance in Britain: he survived, but Dawn Sturgess did not – the blameless British national was fatally poisoned with Novichok on British soil in 2018, as the chaotic byproduct of a bungling attempt by Russian agents to kill former agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. For so many reasons, Navalny’s story concerns us all.  Navalny is released on 12 April in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Navalny review – staggering portrait of Putin’s extraordinary arch-enemy,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/11/navalny-review-staggering-portrait-of-putins-extraordinary-arch-enemy
4/11/2022,"When Kahiye Alim, director of the Council of Somali Organisations (CSO), saw reports that the suspected killer of Southend West MP David Amess was of Somali heritage, he was in a state of shock. Alim was out for dinner on a Friday evening when he heard the news, and could no longer eat. He began to worry about the repercussions the event would have on the British Somali community. Two weeks after the killing, his fears were realised. Abdirachid Fidow, from the Anti-Tribalism Movement, one of the few Somali organisations that reports hate crime, said they normally supported 60 victims a year. But the group had 40 cases, the majority of victims being women, reported to them in response to the naming of Ali Harbi Ali as the suspect. Fidow said at the time the organisation had been “overwhelmed” with the number of people calling them about their experiences in the two weeks afterwards. One of the charity’s grantees received death threats via emails, while another victim received racial abuse from her neighbour, referring to “MP killers”. These reports are likely to be a significant underestimate as the Somali community are unlikely to report hate crimes. It is for this reason that Alim worked to create educational videos explaining what a hate crime is and how to report it. While little is known about Ali himself, his family are well-established figures of political life in Mogadishu, Somalia. His uncle, Awale Kullane, is Somalia’s ambassador to China, while his grandfather ran as an MP in the 1960s. His father, Harbi Ali Kullane, a former communications adviser to the prime minister of Somalia, told reporters he was “traumatised” by his son’s actions. In his role as media adviser, Kullane worked on anti-terrorist campaigns against the jihadist group al-Shabaab. Friends and former colleagues described him as a liberal, charismatic, open-minded man who was not very religious. As the trial ends, so will the heightened attention on the community. Abdi Gure, the coordinator of the Hayaan project that supports the London Somali community with mental health issues, which is run by the charity Mind, warned it will then be business as usual, with long-known socioeconomic issues continuing to be ignored. Community organisers were struggling to get support for what Gure described as “an intergenerational gap”, which he said was feeding the grooming of boys into gang violence and a mental health crisis increasingly affecting the young. “We need to have a conversation with these young guys and establish a dialogue with them … [so they can] be an active part of the community, to give them recognition, and to give them the support and chance to lead,” Gure said. “This is not confined to the Somali community, but all communities need it.” As well as making a video on how to report hate crimes, the CSO created a second video highlighting the contributions of British Somalis in media, education, health and local politics. “People don’t understand who Somalis are, and it’s very important that they just don’t link the word Somali and extremism, because Somalis are not extremists,” Alim said. “We are British citizens and we’ve lived here for about 200 years.” That these basic facts about the community have to be repeated was a huge source of frustration. Fidow was particularly angry at the media, which he accused of fuelling racial tension. He was incredulous that journalists have been stopping British Somalis walking in the streets of west London to ask for their thoughts on the incident. “If you compare when Jo Cox was sadly killed by a white caucasian man, we did not see the media focusing and interviewing white British citizens. This is a form of discrimination and profiling,” he said. “Some media were purposely trying to focus the ethnicity of the suspect rather the crime and were creating a poisonous ‘us and them’ narrative.” As for the tragic killing of Amess, along with the rest of the country, the Somali community was stunned and devastated. “The community was shocked because they could not contemplate what has forced a 25-year-old who has never committed a crime to go to Southend to kill a member of parliament. To this day we still cannot figure out this case and the suspect’s motive,” Fidow said.",News/Society,‘The community was shocked’: British Somalis and the death of David Amess,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/11/the-community-was-shocked-british-somalis-and-the-death-of-david-amess

4/11/2022,"As France trudges towards a runoff election between a technocrat and a populist, it’s natural to want to help. “Don’t do it!”, say Americans on the socials, “Please, France, this is a really bad idea.” “It might seem fun now,” we, their neighbours, chime in, “but once you’re fielding a moral vacuum on the world stage, you’ll see that it isn’t fun at all.” It reminds me of the period just before the referendum, when Europeans begged us not to leave, with heart emojis and witty videos, and it changed my mind only insofar as it made the whole situation sadder, while not changing the minds of the leavers in any way. Or maybe that’s wrong: maybe it made them more determined. We often talk about political parochialism, and why it is, exactly, that we’re only interested in our own elections and have trouble focusing on other nations even when they’re very close by. Is it because we don’t, in the UK, tend to speak any other languages? Is it because foreign voting systems are baffling, or it’s often hard to figure out what a party stands for from its name? No, it’s because impotence is extremely painful. You think you have no democratic agency in your own nation, just because things never go the way you want – you don’t know what “no democratic agency” means until you’ve watched an election that you even halfway care about in a foreign land. You can have made every single mistake they’re making, with the battle scars to prove it, yet your advice counts for nothing, you’re just a wasp, buzzing warnings through double glazing. It’s like trying to persuade your children to never try weed, except only up to a point, because maybe trying weed isn’t the end of the world, while Marine le Pen in government, in a very real sense, is.

4/11/2022,"A man has been convicted at the Old Bailey of the terrorist assassination of the Conservative MP Sir David Amess. Ali Harbi Ali, 26, stabbed Amess to death on 15 October 2021, fuelled by Islamic State propaganda and having spent at least two years searching for an MP to murder. Ali was being radicalised in 2014 at the same time he was going through Prevent, the official UK anti-radicalisation scheme. The Guardian understands that in 2015, while Ali was becoming an adherent of terrorist violence, Prevent assessed he did not pose a significant danger of terrorist violence and his case was closed. Amess died barely an hour after the attack at a church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, as he held an advice surgery for those from his Southend West constituency. Ali was arrested at the scene having posed as a constituent to gain an appointment. He told police after his arrest that he supported IS and he picked Amess whose constituency surgery details, including location and time, were advertised online. Amess, 69, was stabbed 21 times and died in the church, before paramedics could get him to hospital. The jury convicted Ali of the murder of Amess and planning other attacks against MPs after 20 minutes of deliberation. Ali from Kentish town, north London, took a train to Essex and booked an appointment at the constituency surgery with the sole aim of killing Amess. He lied to Amess’s aides that he had recently moved to Essex. Once in the room with Amess, Ali received a call, said sorry, stood up and pulled a knife from his pocket and began a frenzied knife attack. As Amess lay dying, Ali sent a note from his phone justifying his actions to his WhatsApp contacts and stayed in the church. He did not try to attack anyone else, despite ample time and opportunity. A man who entered the church just after the stabbing saw Ali standing holding a knife in his right hand, saying: “I want to kill David, I want them all to die.” Ali was on the phone and the witness could hear a female voice saying: “What have you done?”, to which Ali replied that he had done it because of Syria and that he wanted to be shot and killed. The man asked Ali why he had done it and he replied: “I wanted to kill David and every MP who voted for bombings in Syria, I wanted to die, be shot and be a hero.” After his arrest Ali told police he wanted officers to shoot him and had rushed towards them. Instead, once he realised the first officers on the scene were unarmed, he heeded their command to drop his knife. He had planned an attack for two years, since May 2019, supposedly angered by western actions in Syria. He had carried out reconnaissance on other MPs, even scouting the home of Michael Gove. He loitered around the Houses of Parliament on several occasions looking for a chance to strike. Counter-terrorism officials believe he acted alone. Ali had visited the north London constituency office of Mike Freer MP and been spotted peering in through a window. Searches of his electronic devices showed research on MPs including Dominic Raab; the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, and Ben Wallace. Amess’s killing sparked shock and outrage as well as a review of MPs’ security. He was known as a diligent constituency MP with 38 years in parliament. The jury was told the murder was “an attack on democracy”. Ali will be sentenced at a later date and the crown may ask the court to impose a whole-life tariff, meaning he will never be released.

4/11/2022,"Electric vehicles are on the rise – more electric cars were registered in the UK in 2021 than in the previous five years combined, and in December they accounted for one in every four cars sold, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. If you’re yet to be convinced, here’s what you need to know before you join the EV club … Can an electric car really be driven 380 miles on one charge?Potentially, yes. The new BMW all-electric iX 50 M Sport, for instance, has a WLTP-tested range (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure) of up to 380 miles*. This range could cover your weekly commute and leave enough charge for running around at the weekend. The range of an electric vehicle depends on a number of factors, including: driving style, route and weather conditions and how much luggage you’re carrying. So, as with regular cars, if you are driving shorter journeys and want the power it’s there. But if range is more your thing, you will have a large range – you just have to tailor your driving style. You are, in every sense, in the driving seat. Do I need a home charger?A study (pdf) found that 72% of UK drivers have access to off-street parking, meaning it could be easy for them to charge their cars at home. However, for those without driveways, charging can still be relatively simple. Venues as varied as supermarkets and gyms may have chargers, meaning you can top up your car as you shop or work out. Numbers of lamppost chargers are increasing all the time and some employers offer free charging at the workplace. What’s more, the latest generation of EVs charge faster, so you can charge on the go without having to stay stationary for too long. How do I find the chargers?There are now more than 30,000 public charging points across the UK, in more than 19,000 locations. Many new electric cars come with a built-in satnav that tells you where to find the nearest charging point, while the BMW Connected Drive system and the My BMW app can help you identify public charging locations and will literally guide you there. How much do electric cars cost?Although the price tags of some electric cars tend to be higher than their petrol-powered equivalents on paper, the government offers grants of up to £1,500 for the purchase of electric cars priced under £32,000. Electric cars are also exempt from vehicle tax. While prices for electricity are going up, so are petrol and diesel, and EV drivers with an annual mileage of 9,000 might enjoy significant savings, according to analysis by Which?. It found that charging an EV costs £500-£830 a year, if done mainly at home on a standard tariff, compared with the annual average fuel cost of £1,306-£1,916 for medium to large petrol or diesel cars. BMW has a fuel saving calculator that can estimate potential fuel savings. What is the driving experience like?From acceleration to noise, driving electric cars is smoother and more elegant. In fact, BMW has worked with composer Hans Zimmer on the driving noise of its all-electric i4 and iX models. You can deliver power instantly to the wheels in EVs, because they are free of the mechanical complexity of internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Nowhere is this more thrilling than in the BMW i4 M50, which delivers powerful acceleration from a standstill. How much maintenance do they need?Electric vehicles need significantly less maintenance than their ICE equivalents for a very simple reason – they have fewer moving parts. There’s so much less that can go wrong. Also, the main parts of an EV, such as the battery and electronics, don’t need as much maintenance. What happens if I break down in an EV?Roadside assistance organisations such as the RAC have invested heavily in training and equipment for their patrols to support drivers of electric vehicles. Many of them carry mobile charging units, meaning they could get you back on the road quickly. All new BMWs purchased from a UK authorised BMW Centre come with roadside assistance cover for the first three years. How sustainable are EVs really?Sustainability is not just minimising emissions from driving, but the holistic philosophy behind the entire vehicle. For instance, the BMW iX is produced at facilities that use hydroelectric power. The cobalt and lithium used in EV batteries is procured by BMW, which ensures that environmental standards are maintained during extraction and processing. Materials used in the interiors include FSC certified wood in the centre console and olive-leaf tanned leather upholstery. Recycled aluminium and thermoplastics are also used intelligently where possible. What is the lifespan of an electric car battery?Although most manufacturers quote a five to eight-year warranty on their battery, with BMW offering the latter figure (or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first), the technology is improving at a rapid rate. All the more reason to say goodbye to your combustion engine and accelerate into the future. Book your BMW iX test drive+ here.

There is a new test for fuel consumption, CO2 and electric range figures. The electric range shown was achieved using the new test procedure. Figures shown are for comparability purposes. Only compare fuel consumption, CO2 and electric range figures with other cars tested to the same technical procedures.

4/11/2022,"When was the last time you saw a scientific paper? A physical one, I mean. An older academic in my previous university department used to keep all his scientific journals in recycled cornflakes boxes. On entering his office, you’d be greeted by a wall of Kellogg’s roosters, occupying shelf upon shelf, on packets containing various issues of Journal of Experimental Psychology, Psychophysiology, Journal of Neuropsychology, and the like. It was an odd sight, but there was method to it: if you didn’t keep your journals organised, how could you be expected to find the particular paper you were looking for? The time for cornflakes boxes has passed: now we have the internet. Having been printed on paper since the very first scientific journal was inaugurated in 1665, the overwhelming majority of research is now submitted, reviewed and read online. During the pandemic, it was often devoured on social media, an essential part of the unfolding story of Covid-19. Hard copies of journals are increasingly viewed as curiosities – or not viewed at all. But although the internet has transformed the way we read it, the overall system for how we publish science remains largely unchanged. We still have scientific papers; we still send them off to peer reviewers; we still have editors who give the ultimate thumbs up or down as to whether a paper is published in their journal. This system comes with big problems. Chief among them is the issue of publication bias: reviewers and editors are more likely to give a scientific paper a good write-up and publish it in their journal if it reports positive or exciting results. So scientists go to great lengths to hype up their studies, lean on their analyses so they produce “better” results, and sometimes even commit fraud in order to impress those all-important gatekeepers. This drastically distorts our view of what really went on. There are some possible fixes that change the way journals work. Maybe the decision to publish could be made based only on the methodology of a study, rather than on its results (this is already happening to a modest extent in a few journals). Maybe scientists could just publish all their research by default, and journals would curate, rather than decide, which results get out into the world. But maybe we could go a step further, and get rid of scientific papers altogether. Scientists are obsessed with papers – specifically, with having more papers published under their name, extending the crucial “publications” section of their CV. So it might sound outrageous to suggest we could do without them. But that obsession is the problem. Paradoxically, the sacred status of a published, peer-reviewed paper makes it harder to get the contents of those papers right. Consider the messy reality of scientific research. Studies almost always throw up weird, unexpected numbers that complicate any simple interpretation. But a traditional paper – word count and all – pretty well forces you to dumb things down. If what you’re working towards is a big, milestone goal of a published paper, the temptation is ever-present to file away a few of the jagged edges of your results, to help “tell a better story”. Many scientists admit, in surveys, to doing just that – making their results into unambiguous, attractive-looking papers, but distorting the science along the way. And consider corrections. We know that scientific papers regularly contain errors. One algorithm that ran through thousands of psychology papers found that, at worst, more than 50% had one specific statistical error, and more than 15% had an error serious enough to overturn the results. With papers, correcting this kind of mistake is a slog: you have to write in to the journal, get the attention of the busy editor, and get them to issue a new, short paper that formally details the correction. Many scientists who request corrections find themselves stonewalled or otherwise ignored by journals. Imagine the number of errors that litter the scientific literature that haven’t been corrected because to do so is just too much hassle. Finally, consider data. Back in the day, sharing the raw data that formed the basis of a paper with that paper’s readers was more or less impossible. Now it can be done in a few clicks, by uploading the data to an open repository. And yet, we act as if we live in the world of yesteryear: papers still hardly ever have the data attached, preventing reviewers and readers from seeing the full picture. The solution to all these problems is the same as the answer to “How do I organise my journals if I don’t use cornflakes boxes?” Use the internet. We can change papers into mini-websites (sometimes called “notebooks”) that openly report the results of a given study. Not only does this give everyone a view of the full process from data to analysis to write-up – the dataset would be appended to the website along with all the statistical code used to analyse it, and anyone could reproduce the full analysis and check they get the same numbers – but any corrections could be made swiftly and efficiently, with the date and time of all updates publicly logged. This would be a major improvement on the status quo, where the analysis and writing of papers goes on entirely in private, with scientists then choosing on a whim whether to make their results public. Sure, throwing sunlight on the whole process might reveal ambiguities or hard-to-explain contradictions in the results – but that’s how science really is. There are also other potential benefits of this hi-tech way of publishing science: for example, if you were running a long-term study on the climate or on child development, it would be a breeze to add in new data as it appears. There are barriers to big changes like this. Some are to do with skills: it’s easy to write a Word document with your results and send it in to a journal, as we do now; it’s harder to make a notebook website that weaves together the data, code and interpretation. More importantly, how would peer review operate in this scenario? It’s been suggested that scientists could hire “red teams” – people whose job is to pick holes in your findings – to dig into their notebook sites and test them to destruction. But who would pay, and exactly how the system would work, is up for debate. We’ve made astonishing progress in so many areas of science, and yet we’re still stuck with the old, flawed model of publishing research. Indeed, even the name “paper” harkens back to a bygone age. Some fields of science are already moving in the direction I’ve described here, using online notebooks instead of journals – living documents instead of living fossils. It’s time for the rest of science to follow suit.
