5/6/2022,"Roman Abramovich has denied he wants his £1.6bn loan to Chelsea repaid and has said the funds will be frozen after the club has been sold. The prospect of Todd Boehly’s consortium completing its takeover of the European champions was plunged into major doubt this week because of fears of Abramovich reneging on his promise to write off the club’s debt. Sources close to the process said that Chelsea informed the government they wanted to restructure the sale during talks last week. However Abramovich, who was hit with sanctions after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has moved to reject those claims. The Russian oligarch’s denials will boost hopes that Chelsea, whose special operating licence expires on 31 May, will be under new ownership soon. Boehly’s consortium is in a five-day exclusivity period after being selected as preferred bidders last week and remains the favourite to buy Chelsea, despite late interest from Sir Jim Ratcliffe. A spokesperson for Abramovich said: “Mr Abramovich has not asked for any loan to be repaid to him – such suggestions are entirely false – as are suggestions that Mr Abramovich increased the price of the club last minute. As part of Mr Abramovich’s objective to find a good custodian for Chelsea FC, he has however encouraged each bidder throughout this process to commit investing in the club – including in the academy, women’s team, necessary redevelopment of the stadium as well as maintaining the work of Chelsea Foundation. “Following sanctions and other restrictions imposed on Mr Abramovich by the UK since announcing that the club would be sold, the loan has also become subject to EU sanctions, requiring additional approvals. That means that the funds will be frozen and subject to a legal procedure governed by authorities. These funds are still earmarked for the foundation. The government are aware of these restrictions as well as the legal implications. “To be clear, Mr Abramovich has no access or control of these funds and will not have any access or control of these funds following the sale. Despite the changing circumstances since his initial announcement he remains committed to finding a good custodian for Chelsea FC and making sure the proceeds go to good causes.” Abramovich, who denied that he raised his asking price by £500m last week, initially said that he wanted to donate net proceeds from the sale to victims of the war in Ukraine. His spokesperson insisted that remained the case: “Mr Abramovich’s intentions in relation to gifting the proceeds from the Chelsea sale to charity have not changed. Since the initial announcement, Mr Abramovich’s team has identified senior representatives from UN bodies and large global charitable organisations who have been tasked with forming a foundation and setting out a plan for its activities. “The lead independent expert has had conversations with government representatives presenting the structure and initial plans. Mr Abramovich has not been involved in this work and it has been managed independently by experts with years of experience working in humanitarian organisations.” Consortiums led by Sir Martin Broughton and Steve Pagliuca are watching with interest in case Boehly’s bid breaks down. Ratcliffe has also insisted that his offer should be taken seriously despite Raine, the US bank handling the sale, not viewing the British billionaire as part of the process at the moment.",Sport/Football,Roman Abramovich insists he will not ask Chelsea to repay £1.6bn loan,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/05/roman-abramovich-insists-he-will-not-ask-chelsea-to-repay-16bn-loan
5/6/2022,"The convenience store chain McColl’s has said it is increasingly likely to call in administrators as it battles to secure a rescue deal with 16,000 jobs in the balance. The UK-listed retailer, which has more than 1,100 small shops around the UK including about 250 Morrisons Daily outlets and a number of Martin’s, said any rescue was likely to result in “little or no value” being attributed to its shares. McColl’s traces its roots back to 1901 when a Scottish footballer, Robert Smyth McColl, opened the first RS McColl in Glasgow. The modern business began in 1973 as a vending machine operator and went on to buy several convenience store chains before focusing solely on retail in 2000. While many convenience stores thrived during the pandemic as families chose to shop closer to home and avoid large supermarkets, McColl’s smaller stores did not fare as well. McColl’s has been in talks with its lenders, the Morrisons supermarket group and other parties, thought to include the Issa Brothers who own Asda and the EG petrol station group, since November after suffering from supply difficulties and poor sales. Morrisons, which was bought out by the US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice last year, is seen as a likely saviour for several hundred outlets but is not thought to be interested in buying the entire business. PwC, which has been advising McColl’s consortium of lenders including the Silverpoint hedge fund, is understood to be lining up to handle any administration. A so-called pre-pack deal would allow Morrisons to take on the stores it wants without McColl’s smaller newsagents and its pension scheme. On Thursday McColl’s said: “Whilst no decision has yet been made, McColl’s confirms that unless an alternative solution can be agreed in the short term, it is increasingly likely that the group would be placed into administration with the objective of achieving a sale of the group to a third-party purchaser and securing the interests of creditors and employees. “Even if a successful outcome is achieved, it is likely to result in little or no value being attributed to the group’s ordinary shares.” Last month the company warned again of “short-term funding issues”, reduced consumer spending, and continued supply chain disruption across the industry. Then this week McColl’s said it was delaying publication of its annual results as it continued discussions about “finding a solution for the business”.",News/Business,Retailer McColl’s ‘increasingly likely’ to call in administrators,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/05/retailer-mccolls-increasingly-likely-to-call-in-administrators
5/6/2022,"The government has been accused of betraying some of the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers in Britain after it emerged it would leave out landmark reforms to employment rights from the Queen’s speech. The employment bill is not expected to be included in next Tuesday’s list of priorities for parliament as the government focuses on policies relating to energy and economic crime. The bill, which is being delayed for a second year, would have introduced protections against pregnancy discrimination, ensured restaurants handed over all service charges and tips to staff, and created a single enforcement body for employment rights to make sure that abuses do not fall in the gaps between different regulators. Other measures were expected to include a default right to flexible working patterns and new safeguards for gig economy and zero-hours workers who were promised more “predictable contracts”. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “If the government fails to bring forward an employment bill at next week’s Queen’s speech, it will betray some of the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers in Britain. “Ministers have no excuse for breaking their pledge to enhance workers’ rights – especially after the scandalous events at P&O. They will have conned working people.” Laurence Turner, the head of research and policy at the GMB union, said: “This is a historic missed opportunity. Ministers must bring forward strengthened legislation that extends workers’ rights and outlaws the pernicious practice of fire and rehire once and for all.” Alex Marshall, the head of the IWGB union, which represents thousands of gig economy workers including couriers for the takeaway delivery firms Deliveroo and Just Eat, said he was not surprised by the latest delay. He said the UK government’s actions left it trailing behind Europe, which has laid out legislation to crack down on fake self-employment to ensure workers get the minimum wage, access to sick pay, holidays and other employment rights. The employment bill was first promised in December 2019 after Boris Johnson’s general election victory, claimed as a way to improve UK workers’ rights after Brexit. The plan to crack down on restaurants keeping waiters and kitchen staff tips was promised as recently as September last year – five years after it was first proposed by the government. The new legislation was pledged as a follow-up to a first tranche of changes implemented in April 2019 that ensured workers were handed a written statement of their rights on their first day at work and an end to rules that allowed agency workers to be paid less than employees in the same role. Those reforms came more than two years after they were recommended in a government-backed report into employment practices by Tony Blair’s former adviser Matthew Taylor which was published in July 2017. Taylor said on Thursday: “It is highly disappointing to see the government failing yet again to act on the recommendations of the Good Work review. This leaves unaddressed many harmful weaknesses in our system of labour regulation and employment taxation.” Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the union Unite, said: “Frankly, this employment bill was never going to address the key issues facing workers whose jobs, pay and conditions are under attack. So, it is pretty pathetic that the government is not even prepared to table its own weak proposals to tinker at the margins. “Ministers wring their hands at outrageous attacks on workers, such as the P&O sackings. But when it comes to taking action, they always side with the employers and leave workers in the cold.”",News/Business,Government accused of betraying workers as employment bill is sidelined ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/05/government-accused-of-betraying-workers-as-employment-bill-is-sidelined
5/6/2022,"Scientists studying the DNA of the world’s smallest cetacean and rarest marine mammal, the vaquita porpoise, have made a surprising and bittersweet discovery. With a tiny population of fewer than 10 individuals left, the mammal was assumed by conservationists to be at a similar risk of harmful mutations and inbreeding as other species with small gene pools. However, a team of international researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries (NOAA) and other institutes found that the porpoises (Phocoena sinus) have fewer harmful mutations and are thus likely to be better at avoiding the perils of inbreeding, relative to other species. Unfortunately for the animals, which have a very small geographical range and only live in the upper part of the Gulf of California, between Baja California and Mexico, the biggest threat it faces is illegal fishing with gillnets – flat nets suspended vertically in the water that are notorious for also trapping whales and turtles. If that does not stop immediately, experts say, the species is unlikely to survive. Christopher Kyriazis, a UCLA doctoral student in ecology and a co-lead author of the research, said: “Interestingly, we found the vaquita is not doomed by genetic factors, like harmful mutations, that tend to affect many other species whose gene pool has diminished to a similar point. Outlawed fishing remains their biggest threat.” The small porpoises, about 1.2-1.5 metres (4-5ft) long, often become entangled and die in the large mesh gillnets poachers use to hunt the totoaba, an endangered fish that fetches thousands of dollars on China’s black market for its perceived medicinal properties. While Mexico has banned totoaba fishing and the use of gillnets in the vaquita’s habitat, many say the ban is not always enforced. The researchers analysed the genomes of 20 vaquitas that lived between 1985 and 2017, and used models to predict its extinction risk over 50 years. They concluded that if gillnet fishing ended immediately, the vaquita had a very high chance of recovery from its population crash, without suffering the genetic consequences of inbreeding. If, however, the practice continues, even moderately, the prospects of recovery are less optimistic. The research is being published in the journal Science. Kirk Lohmueller, senior co-author and UCLA associate professor of ecology, said: “A prevailing view in conservation biology and population genetics is that small populations can accumulate deleterious mutations. However, our finding that the vaquita likely has fewer strongly deleterious mutations hiding in the population means that they are better poised to survive future inbreeding, which bodes well for their overall recovery.” The vaquita’s small population and habitat make it the marine equivalent of an island species, the researchers said. The population has plummeted from 576 to seven or eight over the last decade, due to the rise in the illegal totoaba trade.",News/Environment,Vaquita porpoise could survive … but only if illegal fishing stops immediately,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/05/vaquita-porpoise-could-survive-but-only-if-fishing-stops-immediately
5/6/2022,"The Catalan government is calling for answers “from the highest level” after the head of Spain’s National Intelligence Centre (CNI) reportedly confirmed that 18 members of the regional independence movement were spied on with judicial approval. The apparent admission – to a congressional committee – came two weeks after cyber-security experts said at least 63 people connected with the Catalan independence movement had been targeted or infected with Pegasus spyware, and three days after the Spanish government said the phones of the prime minister and the defence minister had been targeted with Pegasus. Although Paz Esteban’s testimony to the official secrets committee was given behind closed doors, political party sources told Spanish media the director of the CNI had confirmed that 18 of the 63 Catalan activists named in a Citizen Lab report at the end of April had been spied on legally and with the relevant judicial approval. According to reports, one of those targeted was the current Catalan regional president, Pere Aragonès – although it is not clear whether he was spied on before or after coming to his current position. It was also unclear whether or not the software alleged to have been used was Pegasus, which, according to its manufacturers, is sold only to governments to track criminals and terrorists. Gabriel Rufián, a spokesperson for Aragonès’s pro-independence Catalan Republican Left (ERC) party, who was at the committee hearing, offered guarded details after leaving the session on Thursday. He said what the committee had heard was in line with what had already been leaked, and that the evidence pointed in two directions: “Basically that it came from a foreign country, or that it was state agencies acting beyond their legal limits”. In a subsequent tweet, Rufián added: “1) There are no secrets – whether official or unofficial. 2) Nothing was said that the CNI hasn’t already leaked. 3) There are only two ways: it was either another country or it was a state agency. And number three is an interpretation. I repeat, an INTERPRETATION.” According to the Citizen Lab report, Aragonès and his three pro-independence predecessors were among more than 60 individuals whose phones were targeted or infected with mercenary spyware using fake texts or WhatsApp messages. Almost all the incidents took place between 2017 – the year of the failed attempt at Catalan independence – and 2020. Aragonès said the revelations confirmed and aggravated “the seriousness of the case of massive espionage against Catalan institutions and the independence movement” that Citizen Lab had uncovered. “We demand the immediate declassification of the judicial authorisation so that we can see what its motivation was, and so that we can defend ourselves,” he said. “It is urgent that we receive a public explanation of this issue – we need to know who authorised it politically and who knew about it. And that’s why we demand an answer from the highest level.” On Wednesday, Aragonès – on whose party Spain’s Socialist-led coalition government depends for parliamentary support – said the spying scandal was “dynamiting” attempts to find a negotiated solution to the Catalan independence crisis. The issue has also caused divisions between the Socialist party and its junior partners in the Unidad Podemos alliance, who have called for the resignation of the defence minister, Margarita Robles, whose department oversees the CNI. There have been questions, too, about why the government chose to reveal that Robles’s phone, and that of the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, had been hacked, a year after the apparent targeting took place. The alleged spying has been criticised by Amnesty International. “The Spanish government can’t use the security of the Spanish state as an excuse to cover up possible human rights violation,” said Esteban Beltrán, the head of Amnesty Spain. The official secrets committee, he added, “is characterised by secrecy and obscurantism [and] cannot be the right place to investigate possible human rights violations”. On Tuesday, Sánchez’s Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE) joined the three parties on the Spanish right in vetoing a parliamentary inquiry into the Pegasus scandal. A PSOE spokesperson said the mooted congressional committee was not needed because an internal investigation by the CNI was already under way, as was an inquiry by the public ombudsman.",News/World news,Catalans demand answers after Spanish spy chief confirms phone hacking,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/catalans-demand-answers-after-spanish-spy-chief-confirms-phone-hacking
5/6/2022,"Republicans in Louisiana have advanced a bill to make abortion a crime of murder, as a draft decision that would end abortion rights continues to spark nationwide protests and police in Washington raised “non-scalable” fences around the supreme court. Supporters admitted the bill, under which a woman terminating a pregnancy or anyone assisting her could be charged, was unconstitutional – as long as Roe v Wade was law. The supreme court is expected to formally overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 case which established the right to abortion, in June. Danny McCormick, the state representative behind the Louisiana bill, said: “We can’t wait on the supreme court.” Since the draft ruling that seems set to overturn Roe was published by Politico on Monday night, Democrats have warned of a likely torrent of challenges to established rights. Joe Biden has sounded the alarm about threats to privacy-based rights including the rights to contraception (Griswold v Connecticut, 1965) and to same-sex marriage (Obergefell v Hodges, 2015). The president also raised the prospect of attacks on the teaching of LGTBQ+ children. On Wednesday, Biden said Republicans pushing such cases constituted “the most extreme political organisation … in recent American history”. The same day in Texas, the Republican governor raised the possibility of challenging a 1982 ruling which said states must provide free education to all children, including those of undocumented migrants. “I think we will resurrect that case and challenge this issue again,” Greg Abbott said. Abbott is a prominent figure on the hard right of that Republican party, with rumoured presidential ambitions. Undocumented migration is a key issue in his re-election fight against Beto O’Rourke, a former congressman, and a central part of the national Republican party’s approach to midterm elections in which they are favoured to take back Congress. Abbott was speaking to the conservative radio host Joe Pagliarulo. Pagliarulo said: “We’re talking about public tax dollars, public property tax dollars going to fund these schools to teach children who are five, six, seven, 10 years old, who don’t even have remedial English skills. This is a real burden on communities. What can you do about that?” Abbott said: “The challenges put on our public systems is extraordinary. Texas already long ago sued the federal government about having to incur the costs of the education program, in a case called Plyler v Doe. “And the supreme court ruled against us on the issue about denying, or let’s say Texas having to bear that burden. I think we will resurrect that case and challenge this issue again, because the expenses are extraordinary and the times are different than when Plyler v Doe was issued many decades ago.” Most progressive concern has focused on rulings which protect privacy rights, among them Lawrence v Texas (2003), which said it was unconstitutional to make gay sex a crime. Charles Kaiser, a leading historian of gay life in the US, said the draft Roe opinion “so blithely disregards past precedents, it could suggest a willingness to overturn previous court decisions enshrining certain fundamental rights for LGBTQ+ people. “One passage in particular set off alarm bells for activists who think its reasoning could jeopardise the court’s decisions legalising sodomy and the right of members of the same sex to marry.” The conservative justice Samuel Alito, Kaiser said, “cited those decisions and denigrated them by saying they used criteria ‘which at a higher level of generality could license fundamental rights to rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like’”. Speaking to Bloomberg Law, Cynthia Soohoo, co-director of the Human Rights and Gender Justice Clinic at the City University of New York, said: “The same arguments that Justice Alito makes against recognising constitutional protection for abortion can be made about … the right to access contraception.” Katherine Franke, director of the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law at Columbia University, told the same site: “Once you kick out the stilts underneath Roe there’s nothing to rest those other decisions on. “There’s no constitutional foundation for the Lawrence decision saying that criminalising same-sex sex is unconstitutional, or the Obergefell decision that says same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry.” On the far right, Peter Brimelow, the founder of the VDare nativist website whom the New York Times has linked to the Fox News host Tucker Carlson, was reported to have greeted news of the draft Roe ruling by writing: “Next stop Brown vs Board!” That was a reference to Brown v Board of Education, the 1954 case which ended racial segregation in public schools.",News/US news,Louisiana Republicans advance bill to make abortion a crime of murder,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/louisiana-abortion-bill-murder-republicans
5/6/2022,"For those of us who have been watching the assault against abortion in the US for years, this week’s leaked supreme court draft opinion – which could pave the way for an overturning of Roe v Wade – came as no surprise. Roe v Wade protects the right to an abortion in the US up to the point a foetus can survive outside the womb, and the religious and far-right have been gunning for it since it was introduced in 1973. Evangelical ideologues, far-right actors and radical-right billionaires have organised to undermine women’s right to safe, legal abortions through a combination of violence against clinics and doctors, dark money and political influence. So, how did the US get here? After years of legal assaults that restricted abortion access and targeted clinics in Republican states; years of disinformation spread by “crisis pregnancy centres”, where women are persuaded to not have abortions; and years of burdensome demands on women to endure ultrasounds, gain parental consent and put up with counselling in order to have a termination, Trump’s election opened the door for abortion rights to end in the US. Ultimately, it required courts, not politicians, to end abortion. That’s where the Federalist Society comes in. Headed by Leonard Leo, the legal organisation supported anti-abortion lawmakers across the US into positions of influence where they could draft laws to ban abortion after 15 weeks … 12 weeks … six weeks … and completely. The end goal was for anti-abortion states to try to implement one of these laws, where it would be challenged again and again until it reached the supreme court. To do that, the anti-abortion movement needed supreme court justices who would enact its agenda. They got their way with the help of the leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, who blocked President Obama from nominating a supreme court judge, leaving the field open for Trump to promote the anti-abortion Neil Gorsuch. After that came two more Trump-appointed justices: Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. That was the judicial assault on abortion rights. But that assault could only happen with the help of money … and lots of it. Luckily for the anti-abortion movement, there are plenty of wealthy foundations keen to fund the cause. They include the DeVos, Prince, and the Templeton Foundation, which have helped to support organisations such as the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the Heritage Foundation and Focus on the Family. Backed by billionaire funding, organisations such as the ADF took the fight against abortion rights to the courts – helping to secure a ban on buffer zones and so-called “partial birth abortion”, and supporting the notorious Hobby Lobby case, which stated that employers should not have to cover birth control on employees’ healthcare plans if it was against the owner’s religious beliefs. These organisations and their billionaire backers have transatlantic reach. Take the DeVos and Koch Foundation-supported Heritage Foundation, which has welcomed a range of Conservative MPs to discuss free speech – including Oliver Dowden, Priti Patel and Liam Fox. It was announced on the day of the supreme court leak that Lord David Frost would soon be addressing the organisation. Then there’s the ADF, which spent $23.3m in Europe between 2008 and 2019, when its European arm’s youth conference played host to the Conservative MP Fiona Bruce. ADF International intervened in Belfast’s notorious “gay cake” case and is allied with organisations that lobbied to further restrict abortion in Poland. The US anti-abortion legal organisation, the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), a second religious freedom organisation that takes on legal cases to challenge abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, has also operated in Europe. Set up by the Republican Pat Robertson, who famously accused feminism of turning women into lesbians, ACLJ’s chief counsel is a former Trump defence attorney, Jay Sekulow. ACLJ spent $15.7m in Europe from 2008-2019. So far you can see how big money, the judiciary and religious freedom movements have come together in the US and Europe. But there’s another active force that has pushed us towards the end of Roe: the far right. Across the far-right infosphere, men discuss the need to ban abortion in order to reverse what they term the “great replacement” – a conspiracy theory that posits white people are being “replaced” by migration from the global south, and that, in the US in particular, this replacement is aided by feminists repressing the white birthrate via abortion. Conspiracy theories such as the “great replacement” sound extreme. But when it comes to the US abortion row, such views are mainstream. Take this quote from the former Republican congressman Steve King, who represented Iowa between 2003-2021. He claimed “the US subtracts from its population a million of our babies in the form of abortion. We add to our population approximately 1.8 million of ‘somebody else’s babies’ who are raised in another culture before they get to us.” Far-right theories circulate globally – that’s why people outside the US shouldn’t just act in solidarity with American women at this time, but prepare to stand up against the possible erosion of their own hard-won rights.

5/6/2022,"The accused head of Colombia’s Gulf Clan cartel is due to appear in a federal court in New York on Thursday, as victims in his home country call for guarantees that he will come clean on atrocities committed by the feared paramilitary fighters he once commanded. Dairo Antonio Úsuga, who is Colombia’s most wanted drug suspect for nearly a decade, was extradited from Colombia late on Wednesday on cocaine and weapons charges. In images shared by local media during his extradition, the former warlord better known by his alias Otoniel, was seen handcuffed and with a wan smile, surrounded by officers. Otoniel’s capture in October was described at the time by President Iván Duque as the biggest blow to the country’s drug trade since the death of Pablo Escobar in 1993. But victims of the country’s decades-long civil war are calling for the 50-year-old trafficker to reveal all he knows about atrocities he oversaw or was privy to. Otoniel’s forces are widely believed to have operated with at least the tacit approval of some local politicians and security forces. Otoniel already faces over 120 charges in Colombia on allegations of murder, illegal recruitment, kidnapping for ransom, sexual abuse of minors, terrorism, illegal possession of weapons and drug trafficking. “As victims we already know who Otoniel is – and we don’t care. What we most need to know is who supported and sponsored him, and that includes the politicians,” said José David Ortega, a spokesperson from a campesino organisation in Córdoba, the northern province where the Clan del Golfo still terrorises communities and assassinates local leaders. “So we are worried that he won’t tell the truth in the US, but will remain silent on what he knows.” The warlord’s long career played out in the shadows of the interwoven political and drug violence which have dogged Colombia for decades. Otoniel and his brother – who was killed in 2012 – were once members of a now-defunct Maoist rebel faction, the Popular Liberation Army, before switching sides to join their far-right paramilitary enemies, the Córdoba and Urabá Peasant Defense Forces (ACCU). When Colombia’s paramilitary groups disbanded in 2006, Otoniel refused to turn in his rifle and remained in the criminal underworld. “The extradition creates obstacles in learning the truth about the armed conflict, and the relationship between armed groups, business people and politicians,” said Pedro Piedrahíta Bustamante, a professor of political science at the University of Medellín. “So, while an alleged drug war win in Colombia is celebrated, the conflict rumbles on and the victims are forgotten.” Gustavo Petro, the leftist frontrunner in Colombia’s presidential election campaign, expressed support for Otoniel’s victims. “Extradition proceedings should prioritize the confessions that victims need,” tweeted Petro. “There is no interest that can be above the victims of violence in Colombia.” Authorities in Colombia said that Otoniel – who is currently being held at the same Manhattan jail that once held the Mexican drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, oversaw the shipment of 200 tonnes of cocaine a year. But for those that live in territory once controlled by Otoniel little is expected to change. “They can take down Otoniel but the criminal organisation will remain,” said Ortega. “As we like to say ‘the king is dead – long live the king.’”",News/World news,Alleged Colombian cartel head due in New York court after extradition,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/dairo-antonio-usuga-colombian-cartel-new-york-extradition
5/6/2022,"Tesco has been criticised over its failure to support crisis-hit British pig farmers, as smaller rival Waitrose extended a £16m lifeline to help suppliers manage the jump in production costs caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine. In an open letter to Tesco chief executive Ken Murphy, the National Pig Association (NPA) said the retailer risked losing its British supply base if it did not pay a “fair price” for its pork. “Paying a little more today is likely to save you money in the long term,” said the NPA’s chair, Rob Mutimer, in the letter. “Unfortunately, we don’t have the luxury of time, and each week that passes puts pig farmers further into the red.” Mutimer highlighted an industry poll that said four out of five producers would go out of business within a year unless their financial situation improved. The UK’s biggest retailer was uniquely positioned to act to prevent the “destruction of the UK pig sector”, he said. “A relatively modest investment by Tesco will not only prevent the destruction of the sector, but it will mean that British pork will still be available at a price affordable to your customers,” added Mutimer, who pointed to the retailer’s recent doubling of annual profits to more than £2bn. Pig farmers are quitting the industry after a disastrous 2021, when an export slump, combined with Covid disruption and Brexit-related shortages of abattoir workers, resulted in a cull of healthy pigs. Now they are dealing with soaring farm costs as disruption resulting from the invasion of Ukraine pushes up the cost of commodities such as wheat and soya. The NPA said the industry had faced an unprecedented crisis over the past 18 months, with the price shock caused by the war turning a “very challenging financial situation to a critical one”. Mutimer said there were still 100,000 pigs stuck on farms that should have gone to slaughter, with farmers losing in excess of £50 per pig due to the enormous gap between the cost of production and the price that retailers were willing to pay. He added that 80% of pig farmers surveyed indicated that they would not survive the next 12 months if things did not improve, and estimated that by 2023 British pork will be in such short supply that most retailers will no longer be able to source it. “Tesco is in a unique position to help because of its UK market share and volume of pork sales,” he said. As well as Waitrose, the NPA said rivals including the Co-op, Marks & Spencer, Aldi, Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s were supporting their suppliers, with many paying more for British pork through their dedicated supply chains. Waitrose said the £16m it was putting up would cover the full cost of rearing and producing pigs – including labour, feed, and fuel – across the 250 farms that supply the supermarket. James Bailey, its executive director, said the company was “offering our farmers financial security when others are being forced out of the sector”.

5/6/2022,"How far and fast should Europe go? In its ferocity and scale, Vladimir Putin’s February invasion of Ukraine caught the west unawares. But since then, the European Union has surprised itself by the speed, unity and depth of its response. In stark contrast to Britain, a generous EU-wide refugee scheme was quickly devised. A flow of defensive weapons across the Ukrainian border has provided invaluable military assistance to Kyiv. The scale of sanctions on individuals, banks and businesses has been unprecedented. But even as these measures were being enacted, EU member states were handing Mr Putin billions of pounds each week to pay for imports of Russian oil and gas. As Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has repeatedly underlined, European energy dependency on Moscow has provided the financial fuel to run the Kremlin’s stuttering yet brutal war machine. Addressing and curtailing that relationship is vital, as Brussels seeks both to pressure Russia into retreat and to secure strategic autonomy in the future. But in the midst of a cost of living crisis, and with a global recession on the horizon, an energy embargo carries significant risks of further inflation, shortages and consumer misery. As Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, put it this week: “We will be harming ourselves, that much is clear.” Against this treacherous backdrop, the ban on oil imports proposed on Wednesday by the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, strikes a decent balance between ambition and caution. According to the plan, Russian supply of crude oil would be prohibited within six months, and refined products by the end of the year. Germany, which has already significantly reduced the level of oil it imports from Russia, will be able to wear this. Countries such as Hungary and Slovakia, whose economies have no equivalent room for manoeuvre, have been offered an exemption until 2023, but are demanding more time. The stakes are huge: it will be a mammoth task to re-source a quarter of the continent’s oil supply, but to do so will deprive Mr Putin’s coffers of an estimated $310m (£251m) a day and one of the major financial props to his regime. There are calls for a parallel ban on natural gas imports, but the energy screw on Moscow needs to be tightened with extreme care: a catastrophic recession in the west – eroding public support for sanctions and possibly leading to social unrest – would help Russia’s cause rather than hinder it. Agreement on an oil embargo would offer the most vivid evidence yet that Mr Putin’s war is fast creating a new Europe. Even a month ago, it seemed doubtful that the EU could travel this far this quickly. Germany, in particular, has ripped up decades-old economic and foreign policy assumptions in a matter of weeks. Weaning EU countries off Russia’s oil and gas will accelerate the necessary transition to clean energy. If a united front is to be maintained, it will also require the kind of economic solidarity between member states that was pioneered during the pandemic. This week, the prime minister of Italy, Mario Draghi, said that the crises facing the west – from the conflict in Ukraine to the climate emergency – must force the pace of greater EU integration and coordination. As well as giving crucial support to Ukraine, the commission’s proposals represent another step towards this more autonomous, cohesive Europe.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on banning Russian oil: defunding Putin’s war machine | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/05/the-guardian-view-on-banning-russian-oil-defunding-putins-war-machine
5/6/2022,"It has taken anti-abortion campaigners a concerted five-decade campaign to get here: the supreme court’s provisional decision to overturn Roe v Wade. More than half of America’s women can expect to live in states where abortion is banned or greatly restricted if, as anticipated, next month’s ruling is largely unchanged. Yet that will not mark the climactic triumph of the anti-abortion lobby. In their eyes, it is merely a staging post to further restrictions on other matters too, affecting more people – including outside the US. First, they will not be satisfied with pre-Roe laws or even the trigger laws waiting for Roe v Wade to fall. There will be a new drive to remove exemptions from bans, such as for rape and incest. While many state laws have so far targeted providers, we can expect increasing attempts to criminalise women who have abortions – or are suspected of having done so. Louisiana already has a trigger law in place to ban abortion after six weeks; on Wednesday, a House committee voted for a bill that would make abortion a homicide and allow women to be charged for obtaining one. Strikingly, the bill would also change the state’s legal definition of a person from a fertilised egg implanted in the womb to simply a fertilised egg. That points to a second issue: activists are already beginning to target forms of birth control, such as emergency contraception and some intrauterine devices that can stop fertilised eggs from being implanted, by wrongly framing them as abortifacients. Third, the draft opinion drives a bulldozer through the foundations of other rights similarly rooted in privacy protections, such as LGBTQ+ rights; even if it adds that abortion is unique because it concerns life or potential life, those all become more vulnerable. Finally, this is not just about the symbolic power of overturning abortion protections in the world’s superpower. US anti-abortion groups have long been spreading their message abroad, through direct activism and funding. They have coordinated and poured millions of dollars into campaigns for restricting abortion in Latin America. Africa has been another prime target. According to openDemocracy, US Christian organisations have spent at least $280m of “dark money” supporting campaigns to restrict abortion and LGBTQ+ rights internationally. Bans kill. Almost all unsafe abortions and related deaths occur in Africa, Latin America and south and west Asia. Globally, the trend has overwhelmingly been for abortion liberalisation: about 50 countries have relaxed laws in the last two and a half decades, with only a handful increasing restrictions. US funding played a part in the near-total ban on abortion that came into force in Poland last year. There, as in the US, the right has captured state institutions; the public opposed further restrictions. In both places, the anti-abortion lobby took root and found victory in specific conditions. Not everything is transplantable. The American groups that funded the anti-abortion lobby in Ireland were repaid with a landslide vote for legalisation. But the rise of misogynistic rightwing populism in many places, and attempts to inflame culture wars in the UK and elsewhere by Donald Trump’s admirers, remind us that there is no room for complacency; 50 years ago, few US evangelicals saw abortion as an issue. The supreme court draft decision has given anti-abortion campaigners new momentum. Their targets and actions must now be monitored closely by opponents outside the US as well as within.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on what follows Roe v Wade: it doesn’t stop here | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/05/the-guardian-view-on-what-follows-roe-v-wade-it-doesnt-stop-here
5/6/2022,"As Victory Day, 9 May, approaches in Russia, Vladimir Putin has yet to win any prize in two months of war in Ukraine that can be shown off to the Russian people. But one could be close: the industrial port city of Mariupol, on the shores of the Azov Sea. Severely damaged in the Russian onslaught, it may now serve as a key prop in the festivities of the coming weeks. Kremlin officials and propagandists have flocked to the town before the holiday, as local cleaning crews are clearing rubble and patriotic statues to Russia are being erected. Fighting is reportedly still raging in the Azovstal plant in Mariupol’s industrial zone, which Putin had previously ordered his military chief to block up so that “not even a fly can get through.” Despite his orders for a siege, Ukrainian soldiers say Russia is making a final push to enter the steelworks and subdue the city’s final defenders just days before Victory Day. Ukrainian intelligence has claimed that Russia is planning to hold part of its key Victory Day parade in the city. “Mariupol, according to [Russia’s] plans, should become the centre of ‘celebrations’,” Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency said in a statement. “For this purpose, the city is urgently cleaning the central streets from rubble, bodies of dead and unexploded Russian ammunition. “A large-scale propaganda campaign continues, during which Russians will be shown stories about the ‘joy’ of local residents from meeting with the invaders,” the intelligence agency continued, noting a recent visit by the Russian state television host Vladimir Solovyov to the city alongside officials. He was pictured wearing local army camouflage and later displayed part of a British anti-tank missile launcher that he had brought back to Moscow with him. Mariupol is a city that few Russians would have imagined as a prize before the war, home to a leading iron and steelworks that played an important role in the city’s economy but also fuelled local pollution. Nonetheless, it was a vibrant port with an active civil society that had withstood the Russian-backed advance in 2014, when Russian artillery came close enough to Mariupol to bombard the city’s outer districts, before being driven back. The Kremlin could be keen to take the city as a strategic point in its goals to build a “land bridge” to Crimea, to gain access to another deep-water port that it used to transport coal, steel and grain, and as a symbolic victory, the largest city yet taken by Russia, which has failed to conquer Kharkiv or Kyiv. And in an extraordinary visit this week, the presidential aide Sergey Kiriyenko, widely seen as Putin’s curator for Russian domestic politics, went to the city this week as part of what are seen as preparations for Russia to absorb the area as part of what has clearly been a war of conquest. The visit chimed with reports that parts of east and southern Ukraine have entered the portfolio of the Kremlin’s domestic politics tsar, and served as confirmation, in the words of a local Russian-affiliated official, for “those who want to see proof that Russia has returned here”. But that victory, if it arrives, will have come at a terrible cost. More than 90% of the city has been damaged, its mayor has said, and even Russian television has shown the extent of the devastation, though blaming it on Ukraine rather than its own artillery’s bombardment. An Associated Press investigation on Thursday reported that more than 600 people may have been killed in a strike against the Mariupol drama theatre in March, where women and children had been sheltering from artillery bombardments. In one video, Chechen fighters were seen celebrating the success of their operation to “destroy and cleanse Mariupol” while standing in front of a burning building in the city centre. Kiriyenko, in his remarks, denied that a parade would take place in cities like Donetsk and Luhansk. “So far it’s impossible to hold the Immortal Regiment or the Victory Parade in Donetsk or Luhansk, but that time will come, and will come soon,” he said. “And Victory Day parades will pass along all the streets of the cities of Donbas, and the Immortal Regiment will pass through all the streets of the cities of Donbas.” But he did not directly address the question of whether a parade could take place in Mariupol instead.",News/World news,Putin hopes to claim Mariupol as key prop in Victory Day celebrations,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/putin-hopes-to-claim-mariupol-as-key-prop-in-victory-day-celebrations
5/6/2022,"Joey Harb possesses no fighting spirit, despite his surname meaning “war” in Arabic. He’s aimless and apathetic: meandering through his young life in western Sydney as a produce assistant at Woolworths, while being indulged by his grandmother Elaine, dabbling in drugs with his good friend Kyri, and getting on his mother Amal’s nerves. Everyone, he thinks, “feels the need to judge his existence”, but that doesn’t propel him to do anything about it. Nothing changes when he finds himself among a group of young men arrested for a violent sexual crime. The fact that he sees the possible two-year prison sentence as “doable” suddenly adds a layer of meaning to the novel’s opening sentence, which tells us that he likes his banh mi with extra chilli, “because it numbed his mouth and he liked numbness”. It’s this passivity that makes the main character of George Haddad’s Losing Face so simultaneously frustrating and endearing. Within a strong and multilayered story, which follows Joey and Elaine in alternating chapters, Haddad presents us with the impact of intergenerational trauma, woven through a sharp appraisal of modern masculinity and its underlying misogyny. Addiction, bitterness, complacency and abandonment underpin the characters’ stories, but it’s the examination of consent that inspires the most thought. The author’s depiction of rape culture is deftly handled: realistic and confronting, and not simply used as fodder for Joey’s growth as a character. Joey knows something is afoot from the moment the young woman is approached by his peers, but his silence in the face of what is unfolding in a public park is telling. It’s a subtle and profound reminder that it’s not a “yes” if there is no clear “no”; the limited focus on the young woman throughout the eventual trial reflects the broader lack of empathy and justice victims face in the public sphere. Haddad colours the crime scene with drug use, in a clever reminder of our ability to still recognise and right wrongs even through clouded judgment. The onus is on the reader to see things for what they are: the consequences of an insistent patriarchal culture that doesn’t pause to consider the rights and needs of others in pursuit of its own want; the entitlement that can breed a take-take attitude in men, regardless of their background. These big-picture themes are enhanced by the little details that vividly place the narrative in Sydney’s west: the top-of-the-line Range Rovers and Mercedes four wheelers in Greenacre, a suburb “trying too hard to play catch-up with other parts of Sydney”; the queue-jumping in the barbershops of Bankstown; the bubble tea craze in Canley Vale; and the Virgin Mary pendants worn as badges of identity around the necks of a particular generation of Lebanese woman. One such woman is Elaine, Joey’s doting grandmother, who has a secret habit that threatens to undo the life she sacrificed so much for as a new bride, and new migrant, in Australia. Even after decades on Earth and many years as a widow, Elaine still cares about saving face in a community that thrives on gossip; she’s experienced too much otherness to risk more ostracisation. Her efforts to conceal her own indiscretions are compounded by her need to protect her wayward grandson. In many ways she is the novel’s heart, and the family’s moral centre. But it’s her daughter Amal, Joey’s mother, who I wish I had seen more of. As a first-generation born Australian, her story would have intricacies and contradictions worth exploring: she’s spent the last decade raising her boys as a single mother and is at last ready to live for herself, if given the chance. Losing Face is rich in scope and substance, but it isn’t the quintessential coming of age story. There’s no sense that Joey is any wiser when you turn the final page. In this vein, Haddad has written something of a universal truth for a particular type of Sydney sub-culture, embodied in a character whose mistakes are brought on by a life lived at the intersections of identity, the lack of role models who have navigated the same struggles of in-betweenness, and the familial tensions that are complicated by traditions and debts traced back to the old country. Haddad’s characters don’t have the luxury of finding themselves or rising above their lot in life. Instead, they’re just trying to get through the here and now. Despite this, and in a move of impeccable storytelling, Haddad offers them hope. For instance, Joey’s only kiss in the story, when “his whole universe folded up real tight for a second before it burst into absolute and unequivocal harmony”, and he’s on the cusp of discovering a whole new world. This hope is subtle, redemptive, simple, and it makes Losing Face a stunning work: an evocative exploration of what it means to falter and to flail, to rise each day knowing your setbacks are embedded deep within you, and to turn up for the people you love even though they’re as screwed up as you are.

5/6/2022,"Josh Frydenberg is in trouble, and he knows it. Three weeks before polling day, billboards asking voters to “keep Josh” started appearing in his Melbourne electorate of Kooyong. At a forum hosted by Sky News on Thursday, the treasurer said the billboards were a reminder to voters that if they like him they should vote for him, regardless of their frustrations with the broader Liberal party. “People need to know that if they want to keep me as the local member but they may have an issue with something that the Liberal party has said or done, and they want to give us a kick for that, at the end of the day that may not leave me as the local member,” he says. “Which is, of course, not what I want.” Kooyong used to be the jewel in the Liberal party’s crown, the seat of its longest-serving and most revered prime minister, Robert Menzies. Its constituents have voted Liberal for so long it has become habit. That a sitting member, the most senior Victorian in the current cabinet, would ask people to vote for him despite the Liberal party, not because of it, would once have been unthinkable. The candidate who has Frydenberg on the run is Prof Monique Ryan, a paediatric neurologist who was running the neurology department at the Royal Children’s hospital before deciding to run for parliament. It is not possible, she told the Sky News forum, to separate Frydenberg’s personal record from that of the government. “I don’t agree that Frydenberg is a moderate Liberal,” she said. “We are defined by our actions, not our words. Frydenberg … has never crossed the floor on a matter of conscience.” The campaign has, at times, become nasty. Frydenberg kicked off his campaign launch with an anecdote about meeting Ryan’s mother-in-law, who told him she would be voting Liberal. Ryan accused Frydenberg of breaking an agreement not to bring family members into the campaign or make personal attacks. She then called Frydenberg the “treasurer for New South Wales”, a remark Frydenberg said was a personal insult. Ryan’s campaign is backed by Climate 200, an independent group funding independent political campaigns in the “teal” electorates, wealthy blue-chip seats whose progressive position on social and environmental policies no longer aligns with those of a Coalition which is steadily moving to the right. Polling conducted by Climate 200 over several weeks places Ryan’s primary vote in the high 20s to low 30s, and Frydenberg’s in the mid 30s to low 40s. To comfortably hold the electorate, Frydenberg would need a primary vote of more than 45. The polling was conducted by the Redbridge Group. Director Kos Samaras says the “Keep Josh” campaign is not working. “Josh’s problem is not him,” Samaras says. “His problem is the party and the leader. The problem for Josh is that he is asking people to vote for Scott Morrison.” The prime minister has skipped over Kooyong on the campaign trail, attending a local synagogue for passover but not staging any formal election events in the area. Frydenberg has defended his absence saying he is the person best placed to defend the government’s record in Kooyong. But defending that record is one of the reasons Frydenberg is on the nose. Samaras says respondents to polls have independently raised his criticism of Victoria during the 2020 and 2021 lockdowns, during which he called the Daniel Andrews governments’ Covid rules “​​ludicrous and unacceptable”, as a mark against the treasurer. Frydenberg has acknowledged that he is in the fight of his life in the seat. His family sat for a front page photo and double-page spread in the Herald Sun. He has spent big on leaflets and billboards. Voters in Kooyong have provided Guardian Australia with copies of more than 20 mail-outs from Frydenberg’s campaign, including an endorsement from the CEO of Guide Dogs Victoria, Karen Hayes, which resulted in her being stood down from her position; copies of old speeches; a six-page booklet outlining his “local plan” for Kooyong; and pamphlets warning that a vote for an independent, in scare quotes, is a “vote for uncertainty”. Ryan’s campaign, in contrast, has sent out six mail-outs setting out her key policies: an independent national integrity commission, meaningful action on climate, meaningful action on gender equality. It has also issued 3,000 corflutes and posters, which a campaign spokesperson says puts one in every 25 houses in the electorate. Frydenberg’s face is on the side of every telephone box and most billboards. It is also on houses – in almost every street with placards supporting Ryan, there is also a placard supporting Frydenberg. Greens candidate Piers Mitchem is also well-represented in the corflute battle. Labor is barely noticeable. George Theodore, an independent coffee shop owner in Balwyn, down the western, more conservative end of the electorate, says that while many of his customers appear to have “checked out” of the political conversation, it is hard to forget an election is on. “I have never seen so many politicians,” he says. “People are more aware that there is competition this year.” Politicians aside, foot traffic on Whitehorse Road, the main shopping strip, is way down. A row of businesses across the street from him are standing empty, with “For lease” signs in the windows. Even the banks are moving: both the Bendigo Bank and ANZ branches have swapped from the north side of the road to the south in the past two years to escape escalating rent. “Even they can’t afford the rent,” Theodore says. Theodore has operated Balwyn Coffee Centre on Whitehorse Road for 10 years. His business survived Melbourne’s six lockdowns – “People are still buying coffee” – but says the strip “hasn’t recovered”. Outside Theodore’s shop, two undecided voters nominate the rising cost of living as their most pressing concern. That should be good news for a treasurer who is campaigning on the back of his economic management credentials, but Frydenberg is struggling to claim credit for positive economic indicators, like the low unemployment rate, without also taking blame for the negatives, such as the Reserve Bank’s decision this week to raise the cash rate for the first time since 2010. Toward the other end of the electorate, at Kew Junction, one of the areas that flipped to the Greens in the 2019 election, Chan Sreiy says cost of living pressures are hitting hard. He has owned and operated Kew Breadworks bakery and cafe for 19 years. Frydenberg and Ryan have both visited him on the hustings, and asked to put posters in his window. Only Frydenberg’s remains – Ryan’s poster disappeared one day while Sreiy was serving customers. “I would say 60% of the customers who come in here are very unhappy because they work too hard,” Sreiy says. “The price of everything has just gone up through the roof.”",News/Australia news,Josh Frydenberg pleads with unhappy Liberal voters to stick by him as pressure in Kooyong grows,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/josh-frydenberg-pleads-with-unhappy-liberal-voters-to-stick-by-him-as-pressure-in-kooyong-grows
5/6/2022,"The journey began – like all good journeys – in the Downing Centre local court. I had just successfully contested a driving charge (failure to wear a seatbelt) with my friend Jemma (I was the passenger, she was driving). Some of our evidence hinged on the fact that Jemma was an older P-plater – and therefore less likely to take risks. Jemma was prudent in part because of her age, in part because we had a baby in the car with us, and in part because she’d had intensive driving lessons with a super-instructor called Grace. After we won our case, Jemma turned to me and said: “Promise me you’ll ring Grace. She’s the best and she will be the one to help you get your licence.” It was enticing. I’d had half a dozen instructors. One of them, who also drove a prison bus, said he felt safer being in a vehicle with murderers than with me. Another abruptly announced her retirement from being a driving instructor 15 minutes into our first lesson. But Grace … even her name sounded like an answered prayer, like salvation for the unsalvageable, like it should have “amazing” as prefix. ****** I met Grace in Darling Point and we started driving around the quiet streets and it was all good and all nice and I could do this – driving around Darling Point in the middle of the day with no one around, until Grace said, “At the bottom of the street, turn left.” At the bottom of the street was New South Head Road. Four lanes of traffic, all moving so fast that I froze. “You can do it,” said Grace encouragingly. “You’re a professional driver.” And so I did. I joined the traffic, mysteriously bolstered by her use of the word “professional”. No one had ever called me that before. I’d also never driven in Sydney, despite having lived in the city on and off since 2001. I knew Sydney as a passenger – but it was a different story as a driver. OMG. Holy hell. I was to discover why Sydney drivers are considered by many to be the worst in the world. They are complete pricks. They don’t just not let you in, they speed up so you can’t get in – for no apparent reason except that they would apparently rather have you die than give you a one-second advantage in the traffic. But in the eight months of lessons with Grace, I got used to it. Grace softened it with her endearing habit of saying something gloomy, then ending the sentence with a laugh. She’d say, “Sydney drivers are terrible, so rude, the eastern suburbs are the worst. Ha ha.” Or “that driver, in the van, he’s going to kill someone. Ha ha.” Or “You’re going to hit that Porsche. Ha ha.” Learning to drive in Sydney’s east was depressing. The roads were full of potholes and Porsches, and people seemed to actively want to kill me and others on the road. I wondered about the relationship of wealth to the impulse to obliterate others (or at least not let them merge) – but Grace, as well as teaching me how to drive, was also teaching me how not to be reactive, to just laugh in the face of death and money. Around and around we went, practising the test routes for a Bondi Junction exam. But there was a secret I was keeping from Grace that I felt vaguely ashamed of, because it felt like cheating. I was not going to take the test in Sydney. As a dual resident of Victoria and New South Wales, I was going to take the test in Victoria – in a small place, with nice people (even better, no people) where I might have a better chance of passing. ****** “Don’t do your test in Kyneton,” people would say, but offer only obscure, superstitious opinions when asked why: the streets were too narrow, it rained a lot, there was a mountain nearby that threw a shadow across the town and created bad ju-ju. I chose Kyneton. My choice was mostly based on population size. It was small, and small meant that I would not be tailgated by a large Range Rover on the Cranbrook drop-off, or almost cleaned up at the lights at Charing Cross by an angry tradie. I’d had only had one lesson before in Kyneton that ended – obscurely – with a homeless woman giving me $50 for more driving lessons. It boded well. My pal Rick Morton was able to drive me to Kyneton for the test and collect me when it was over. Rick is the sort of friend you want to take you to a big medical appointment or a driving test or to court. He’s bluff and cheery. “It’ll be fine, you’ll smash it,” he said. Ha ha. (He later confessed that he didn’t think I would be successful in getting my licence, and he was preparing to comfort me on the drive back). The local instructor who accompanied me to the test in her car told me earlier that she would be unable to give me guidance while the test was on, including speaking in pre-agreed “code words”. The tester got in the car. She seemed nice, professional. Behind the wheel, I pulled up the driveway out of the parking lot, ready to turn on to the road. Showtime. “Turn left,” said the tester. Suddenly panic hit me like a slap. What way was left?? I didn’t know! I couldn’t recall if it was this way or that. Was left towards town or towards the big roundabout? What was left?? This was my fatal flaw, the reason my parents didn’t think I should drive, my secret shame, the thing that had held me back for so long, the problem that I had fought so hard to overcome with Grace and all the driving instructors, over two decades: I didn’t know my left from my right. “Turn left at the top of the drive.” Left. Left. Time stretched on. I had been in this car forever with these women. We had all grown old in this capsule of steel and plastic. But soon I would have to turn. I would have to take a punt on what way “left” is. Give me a code, I wanted to say but couldn’t. What way is it?? Turn left. Then it kicked in – like a starter motor on a rusty whipper snipper or an old chainsaw. BR….. RRRRRR. RRRRRRRRRRRRR. I remembered! Indicator ON! Left was left! I passed in the end. It was almost a perfect test. I was, as Grace would say, “a professional driver”. I just wish she had been there to see it.",Opinion/Opinion,On my driving test panic hit me like a slap.

5/6/2022,"The Morrison government’s climate change commitments are consistent with more than 3C of global heating, bordering on 4C, a level that would lead to catastrophic damage across the planet, according to a new analysis. Labor’s climate target was found to be consistent with about 2C of heating above pre-industrial levels. Both would be expected to lead to the loss of tropical coral reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef, and a significant rise in the number of extreme heat events in Australia, assuming other countries took equivalent action. The research by Climate Analytics found neither major party had emissions reduction goals that lived up to the commitment that was made in the landmark 2015 Paris agreement, and strengthened in last year’s Glasgow climate pact, to aim to limit heating to as close as possible to 1.5C. It found targets proposed by the Greens and the “teal independents” vying for inner-city seats were consistent with that mark. Bill Hare, Climate Analytics’ chief executive, said scientists had demonstrated the risk of irreversible climate impacts if 1.5C was passed for even a short period of time was severe. When measured against that goal, the Coalition was acting in a way that would have catastrophic ramifications, while Labor “hadn’t really come to face the consequences of what the science is saying”. Despite this, Hare said the implications of not dealing with climate change had largely been missing from the election campaign. “The polls have suggested climate change is a very big issue, up there with the cost of living and integrity, but it is not really penetrating into the main political and media discussion,” he said. “This is the case despite the fact Australia has faced world-stage catastrophes in the past few years.” The scientific consensus is that global temperatures have risen about 1C since 1900, overwhelmingly due to greenhouse gas emissions. In Australia, the average increase has been 1.4C. It has been linked to unprecedented bushfires, rainfall events that have caused catastrophic flooding and four mass coral bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef since 2016. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Climate Analytics found the Coalition’s 2030 emissions target – a 26-28% cut compared with 2005 levels – was consistent with all tropical reefs being destroyed and maximum temperatures in Australia increasing by about 3C. Intense heat events that might now occur once a decade would be expected every year, and would be significantly hotter. Labor’s 2030 target of a 43% cut was consistent with the likely destruction of the Great Barrier Reef and maximum temperatures in Australia rising by 1.7C. Once-a-decade intense heat events would be expected roughly every three years. The analysis found Australia should cut its emissions by 57% by 2030 to be compatible with a 1.5C heating goal. The Greens say Australia should be cutting by 75% over that time period, while the teal independents largely support a climate bill proposed by Zali Steggall that includes a 60% target. Climate Analytics said both were consistent with some tropical reef areas surviving, and intense heat events happening more frequently than the past few decades. Much of the focus on climate policy during the election campaign has been on Labor’s proposal to use the Coalition’s “safeguard mechanism” policy to gradually reduce industrial emissions, and divisions within the government over whether it is committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. A separate report released on Friday highlighted another Labor policy – a commitment to make a bid to host a major UN climate summit in partnership with Pacific countries in the next parliamentary term. Richie Merzian, climate and energy director with the progressive Australia Institute, said hosting the COP29 summit in 2024 could be the most important thing the country did on the climate crisis over the next three years as it would reset its reputation after years of accusations it was a global “climate laggard” and could help repair relationships in the Pacific. Speaking alongside Labor leader Anthony Albanese on Thursday, the party’s climate change and energy spokesperson, Chris Bowen, said hosting a summit would “send the message to the world that Australia is under new management when it comes to climate” and allowing it to sell the country as a “renewable energy powerhouse”.",News/Environment,"Coalition climate target consistent with more than 3C global heating, research says",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/06/coalition-climate-target-consistent-with-more-than-3c-global-heating-research-says
5/6/2022,"I’ve never been happy with my looks and was often overlooked as a child and high school for the prettier girls which was very hurtful. I’ve got a seven-month-old baby (brown hair and brown eyes), quite chubby compared to other babies her age, and when I see pictures of her with my friends with babies a similar age I feel worried that she will always be seen as the “less than” one in the group due to her looks. The other babies in my friendship group have bigger eyes, blond hair and blue eyes and my friends and extended family have made comments about her “not taking after this side of the family” (ie by being blond and skinny) or “oh no, she is going to have brown eyes!” I worry for her. I know it sounds silly but the world is judged on looks and I don’t want her to feel the same, less-than, body-shamed feelings that I did. How do I go about making sure she doesn’t feel less-than or not-as-good-as based on her looks? Eleanor says: First, let’s start with the obvious: a brown-haired brown-eyed “chubby” baby does not have “less-than” looks. Not only is there nothing wrong with being big or dark-haired, even if there was, how someone looks at seven months is an indicator of almost nothing. A women’s hospital near me used to stick up Polaroids of odd-looking babies to reassure new mothers that many infants look peculiar – not roly-poly like your little one, but really peculiar, with a conical head or a heavily wrinkled brow or hair all over their body. It was meant to give a chuckle as well as a reminder that kids change radically as they grow. Colouring reverses, minuscule babies become big and round, little sausage limbs turn lean and lanky. It takes years to look like ourselves, so for now, everyone’s predictions about your daughter are baseless. Second, you asked how to make sure she doesn’t go through what you did. The curse of parental love is that it comes with a dose of worry, and naturally, that worry rummages through our own life when it wants to know what to be vigilant about. Every parent wonders how to shield their child from the particular suffering they endured themselves. The risk, though, is that vigilance can become self-fulfilling. Bracing a child too much for a bad outcome can teach them to expect it, or to see the world through its lens. The challenge is to equip kids in case something bad lies ahead while letting them find out on their own if it does. Many children inherit their parents’ traumas around money, betrayal, love – not because their parents hurt them, but because they’re on such high alert that someone else will. That’s especially true when it comes to appearance. Kids don’t come into the world with concepts like “too heavy” or “too plain”. Someone has to teach us what those things mean and that they might apply to us. The hazard is that by explicitly telling your daughter there’s nothing wrong with how she looks, you raise the possibility that there may be. Fortunately, time is on your side here. It’s years before your daughter can think about this. I think one of the most helpful things you could do in that time is try to heal your own experience with looks. That won’t be easy – you’ve spent a lifetime being stifled by beauty expectations and it is hard, confronting work to face them down. But lots of girls learn beauty standards by hearing Mum self-deprecate in front of the mirror; if you can love what you see instead, or even just not think about it very much, she’ll have an ally before the fight begins. You can’t control what she hears from other people – but you can show her what it looks like to not mind. And if you want to know what it would be like to see yourself as beautiful, try looking through your daughter’s eyes – to her you’ll be the most magical creature alive. In the meantime, you can bat relatives away with “I know, isn’t she gorgeous?”, or tell them it’s a parenting rule that we don’t comment on people’s appearance, good or bad. These strategies might help de-emphasise appearance as something she thinks about, at least for a while. Sometimes the best way to spare a child the things we fear is to spare them the fear itself.

5/6/2022,"Queensland’s Labor government is playing “a dangerous game” with coal that could hurt the party’s chances in inner-city Brisbane in the federal election, according a political expert. On Wednesday, the state energy minister, Mick de Brenni, ruled out closing any of Queensland’s eight coal-fired power plants, despite plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. A spokesperson for de Brenni on Thursday said the minister was answering a question when he made those comments – describing them as a long-held position of state Labor – and that three of those power stations were privately owned. Glenn Kefford, a political scientist from the University of Queensland, said the comments appeared to be “part of a broader strategy” that Labor had implemented at the state level. He said the party had “walked away” from “some of the more ambitious messaging around climate change, in particular in Queensland”. “We know what happened in 2019,” he said. “We all can remember the infamous Adani convoy and, I think, that can be taken as part of the messaging strategy here.” But Kefford said he did not expect this kind of messaging to be amplified too much over coming weeks. “We know the dangers of this strategy,” he said. “Labor has had problems with this type of approach previously, whether there’s a perception that they walk both sides of the street.” Where Labor feared dividing blue collar and professional voters during the 2019 federal election, the Coalition faced a similar threat with regional and inner-city supporters. “We’ve got both major parties effectively wedged on climate change and extractive industries,” Kefford said. The minister’s comments were seized upon by environmental groups and the federal Greens party, which is trying to unseat Labor’s Terri Butler from Kevin Rudd’s old division of Griffith, and targeting the nearby, Liberal National party-held electorates of Ryan and Brisbane. The Greens candidate for Brisbane, Stephen Bates, said the comments would “100%” impact the campaign in that electorate, where he said the number one election issue was “far and away” the climate crisis. “It’s just another example, really, that Labor’s policies on climate change depending on your distance to the 4000 postcode,” he said. “If you want to have a serious plan to address climate change, you have to close down coal and gas-fired power stations. That’s just what the science tells us. That’s what the IPCC report tells us.” Federal Labor’s shadow minister for Queensland resources, Murray Watt, said upgrading the national electricity grid was the “key to reducing our emissions, cutting power prices and creating new energy and manufacturing jobs”. “That’s exactly what Labor’s powering Australia and rewiring the nation policies will do,” he said. “The country’s leading energy economists, Reputex, modelled Labor’s plan and found that Labor’s policies don’t bring forward coal closures.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning De Brenni said the state government was committed to releasing its energy plan this year, which would “specify the pathway to modernising our assets, and show how they will sit at the heart of our renewable energy ecosystem”. “As I have repeatedly said before, we will not be shutting the gate on our power stations, their workers or their communities and instead will invest in their future,” the energy minister said. The Queensland Conservation Council’s director, Dave Copeman, said de Brenni’s comments “ignored” the impact of coal power on Queenslanders electricity bills” and were “inconsistent [with] the market reality”. “Keeping coal online will force electricity prices higher, adding to inflation and cost-of-living pressures for Queenslanders,” Copeman said. Kefford said his team had been researching digital ads in the election campaign and had picked up on a glaring omission in messaging. “Neither of the major parties are talking about climate change at all, they don’t want to touch the issue,” he said.",News/Australia news,"Keeping coal-fired power plants running is a ‘dangerous game’ for Queensland Labor, expert says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/keeping-coal-fired-power-plants-running-is-a-dangerous-game-for-queensland-labor-expert-says
5/6/2022,"Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese are preparing for the final sprint to the 21 May election finish line when Australia will decide who forms government. Labor can sniff victory, but the Liberals are not giving up, hoping the final fortnight may yet see the undecided voters stick with the devil they know. While national polls show Labor clearly ahead of the Coalition and in line for a comfortable victory, both sides suggest the contest could still be close, with the low primary vote of each of the major parties making the result difficult to pick. In key seats the preferences of minor parties may also prove crucial, with Jacqui Lambie, Pauline Hanson and Clive Palmer all potential kingmakers. Scarred by bold predictions of victory at the 2019 poll, caution now abounds on the Labor side, despite most still believing a Labor government – majority or minority – is the most likely outcome. The electorate is volatile, and there are unknowns that could yet manifest peculiar results – for example, could the United Australia vote cause an upset in certain seats previously not in play? Who would “teal” independents back in the event of a hung parliament? Labor holds a notional 69 seats in the 151-seat House of Representatives, so needs a net gain of seven seats to form majority government, but only five to be confident of minority government. The Liberals hold 75 seats and will need to offset any losses with gains elsewhere. With voting at pre-poll centres to open across the country on Monday, here is a look at the path to victory. Labor is hoping to win at least two seats in the west, with Swan and Pearce the most likely gains. If the swing is on, there is also hope that Hasluck (5.9%) could be in play, despite the popularity of the local MP, Ken Wyatt. Swan (3.2%) is held by the outgoing Steve Irons, while Pearce (5.2%) is being vacated by the former attorney general Christian Porter. Cost of living is a key concern in both of these seats, particularly in the mortgage belt seat of Pearce in Perth’s far northern suburbs where petrol prices, inflation and interest rate hikes will bite. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Winning both seats is key for Labor to reach its seven seat target for majority government. The Liberal MP Celia Hammond is also fending off a challenge from independent Kate Chaney in the blue-ribbon seat of Curtin that is worrying the party in the west. In South Australia, the marginal seat of Boothby is the only electorate likely to change hands, with Labor extremely confident of picking up the seat held by the Liberals, but being vacated by the incumbent MP Nicolle Flint. It is held on only a 1.4% margin and so Labor believes the swing in the state will be sufficient to ensure it changes hands. Both Labor and the Liberal party have marginal seats in Victoria, and are hoping to flip them. Labor’s best hopes are Chisholm, held by Gladys Liu on a 0.5% margin, and Higgins, held by Katie Allen on a 3.7% margin. The Coalition, however, has been targeting Labor-held Corangamite, held by Libby Coker on a 1% margin, and Dunkley, held by Peta Murphy on a 2.7% margin. Corangamite is seen as a possible Coalition gain, given its preselection of the Geelong mayor, Stephanie Asher.

For the Liberals, two blue-ribbon seats are also in the firing line of teal independents, with Josh Frydenberg in Kooyong (6.4%) and Tim Wilson in Goldstein (7.8%) both at risk. The Coalition is also trying to unseat independent Helen Haines from the regional Victorian seat of Indi, which she holds on a 1.4% margin. Three seats in Tasmania will be fiercely contested, with Liberal-held Bass and Braddon being targeted by Labor, and Lyons being an outside chance to flip to the Liberals. Bridget Archer in Bass has carved out a reputation for being a fiercely independent local member and is expected to hang on to the seat despite its slim 0.4% margin, boosted by preferences from Jacqui Lambie. Braddon (3.1%) is seen as a more likely Labor gain, where the incumbent, Gavin Pearce, is facing a challenge from the Burnie city councillor Chris Lynch. In Lyons, Labor’s Brian Mitchell is being targeted by the Liberals, and while its 5.2% margin is overinflated after the Liberals disendorsed its candidate during the 2019 campaign, Labor remains confident it can keep the seat. Labor has more marginal seats than the Liberals in NSW, with both sides confident of picking up seats. Reid in western Sydney, held by Fiona Martin on a 3.2% margin, is seen as a likely gain to the Labor party. After that, NSW becomes more challenging for Labor, but it is also targeting Robertson (4.2%) and sees Bennelong (6.9%) as a strong chance given the retirement of John Alexander and a backlash against the Coalition within the Chinese community. The Coalition is hoping former state MP Andrew Constance can win Gilmore for the Liberal party, but Labor, which holds the seat on a 2.6% margin, believes there may be enough anti-Morrison sentiment there to hang on. The Coalition also has its sights on Labor-held Hunter ( 3%) and Parramatta (3.5%), which it believes are in “striking distance”, but these are unlikely wins. The Liberal party also expects to win back Hughes, held by Craig Kelly who defected to the UAP. Other Labor marginal seats in the state, including Macquarie, Eden-Monaro and Dobell, are not seen by either side as likely to flip. For the Liberals, it is also at risk of losing up to three “teal” seats, with Trent Zimmerman in North Sydney, Dave Sharma in Wentworth and Jason Falinski in Mackellar all under threat. After big swings to the Coalition in Queensland in 2019, a margin correction is expected at this election, but a question mark remains over how many seats Labor can pick up. Labor is eyeing off Brisbane, held by Liberal Trevor Evans on a 4.9% margin, and Ryan, held by Julian Simmonds on a 6% margin, which it is hoping to clinch with the help of Green preferences. It also thinks it is in with a chance in Leichhardt, but is up against popular incumbent Warren Entsch, and Longman, held by Terry Young on a 3.3% margin. Labor is also making a play for the seat of Flynn, but its 8.7% margin makes the task challenging, despite the preselection of the popular Gladstone mayor, Matt Burnett. In the NT, the seat of Lingiari, held by the Labor party on a 5.5% margin, is one the Coalition is targeting with the retirement of the long-serving Labor MP Warren Snowdon. The Nationals have preselected the former Alice Springs mayor Damien Ryan to run for the seat, but Labor believes the former NT deputy chief minister Marion Scrymgour will fend off the challenge.",News/Australia news,Path to victory: the seats that will decide the 2022 federal election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/path-to-victory-the-seats-that-will-decide-the-2022-federal-election
5/6/2022,"Reducing the cost of living and fixing the aged care system are voters’ two top priorities for the 2022 federal election, according to a new Australian National University poll. The survey of more than 3,500 people found those two issues transcended the political divide with more than 60% nominating them as top priorities, ranking ahead of issues of more concern to Coalition voters, including defence against terrorist attacks and reducing crime. A majority of voters also nominated strengthening the nation’s economy (54.4%), reducing the cost of healthcare (53.5%) and dealing with global climate change (52.8%) as top priorities for the federal government. The findings come as Labor prepares to enter the final fortnight of the campaign with a negative ad spree targeting Scott Morrison’s handling of the economy. The new ad, launched on Thursday evening, notes the Coalition “doubled our debt even before Covid” and that companies with rising revenues received $19.7bn of jobkeeper wage subsidies, which it says is “one of the reasons our debt has now tripled”. “Some of that money could’ve gone to making your life a bit easier,” it said. “[Morrison] says he’s good with money, but that really doesn’t add up.” Labor has been buoyed up by a string of public polls finding it retains a lead against the Coalition. The ANU poll found the Coalition’s primary vote had declined from 31.7% in January to 31.2% in April. While Labor’s vote also fell from 36.3% to 34.3%, this was balanced out by a rise in the Greens vote from 14.2% to 16.2%. The ANU poll did not calculate the two-party preferred result, but the study by professors Nicholas Biddle and Matthew Gray concluded Labor was in an “election winning position” with a “very challenging few weeks” ahead for Scott Morrison to turn it around. Since the budget reply in March, Anthony Albanese has made improving aged care central to Labor’s pitch to voters. Although the budget contained $8.6bn in cuts to petrol and income taxes, designed to lower the cost of living, Labor has argued these are temporary measures that will not permanently improve the cost of living, unlike its childcare policy. The Reserve Bank’s decision to hike the cash rate to 0.35% on Tuesday has further raised the importance of cost-of-living in the election campaign. Of the ANU poll respondents, 64.7% categorised reducing the cost of living as a “top priority”, which Biddle said was a view held by people intending to vote for Labor, the Coalition, or neither party. “For Coalition voters, 60.8% said this was the highest priority. Among Labor voters it was even higher, with 68.8% saying the same.” That was followed by fixing the aged care system, which 60.1% of respondents said was a “top priority”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Increasing wages in the aged care system was a “top priority” for 43.2% of respondents, much higher than those who said the same of wages in the childcare system (29.8%). Despite Australia approaching 5,000 deaths from Covid-19 this year, more than double the previous two years combined, dealing with the coronavirus outbreak was rated a “top priority” by just 36.5% of voters. Perceived Coalition strengths of “strengthening the Australian military” and “dealing with the issue of migration” were much lower priorities, with 28.9% and 22.3% listing these as top priorities. Only 27.2% of voters thought fixing the budget was a top priority. The ANU poll is a longitudinal survey, interviewing many of the same respondents since January 2020 when Morrison’s handling of the summer bushfires hit the Coalition vote hard, before it recovered due to approval of its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the April 2022 poll, the ANU study found Australians’ attitude to the vaccine program had improved greatly, with just 6.6% of respondents saying the rollout had not gone well “at all”, compared with 23.7% who said it had gone “very well”.",News/Australia news,"Cost of living and fixing aged care are top concerns as election nears, ANU poll shows",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/cost-of-living-and-fixing-aged-care-are-top-concerns-as-election-nears-anu-poll-shows
5/6/2022,"Australian men are more likely to take time from their female partners for exercise, which women are not afforded equally in return, research suggests. Canberra researchers have analysed gender disparities in physical activity, finding that “hour for hour, paid or unpaid, women’s physical activity is constrained by their time use in ways that men’s is not”. The study used data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, drawing on information from 7,000 households made up of heterosexual couples aged 25 to 64. The research, published in the Journal of Health and Social Behaviour, analysed the relationship between paid and family work time and physical activity. Women were less physically active than men: 28.6% of women reported doing three moderate or intensive physical activities for at least 30 minutes a week, compared to 34% of men. The researchers found that women’s physical activity dropped when either their paid or family work hours increased, or if the timing of their paid work was less flexible. An increase in women’s paid work time by 10 hours a week was associated with a six percentage point decrease in physical activity, to 22.6%. The study co-author Prof Lyndall Strazdins, of the Australian National University, said: “We’re wanting women to work equally, but we’re not enabling them to do that, and they’re cutting back on their health.” A 10-hour increase in men’s paid work was associated with a smaller drop in physical activity – by two percentage points to 32% being physically active. Strazdins said longer work hours for men had “almost no effect on their time for being active and keeping themselves healthy”. Heterosexual men were likely to increase their physical activity when the working hours of their partners were more flexible, the research also found. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Men reported more total paid and family work commitments a week, while women reported longer family work hours and less control over their work time. “For men, time spent on family work appears to be flexible and able to incorporate or accommodate physical activity: a protective factor that helps buffer men’s physical activity from long paid work hours,” the study found. “Although men generally spend longer hours on the job than women do … this ‘buys’ them less and different types of family work.” Strazdins said: “When men have a job, they reduce the time they spend at home on care. But when women have a job, they don’t. What that tells you is that men’s jobs actually buy them out of family work, and it shifts time on to women.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Women were “taking up extra work to free their partners to earn an income and be healthy”, Strazdins said. “And then they are cutting back on their own health.” The problem was structural rather than individual, according to Strazdins, who said the current system “coerces men into long-hour jobs and then women into supporting that”. Strazdins added: “The solution has to start with us changing work to be gender fair, and that means allowing men to have more time for care, and women more time for work.” The study also found “it is likely that non-binary, non-heterosexual couples likely negotiate time use and exchange differently within the household”.",News/Australia news,"Men take time from female partners for exercise, Australian study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/men-take-time-from-female-partners-for-exercise-australian-study-finds
5/6/2022,"The jet-set catwalk show is back, with its sunny backdrops and international front row. But the new world order is complicating the seating plan. At Chanel’s first fashion show outside France since the pandemic, the Monte Carlo beachfront played catwalk to a pageant of supermodels dressed in lighthearted tribute to grand prix glitz. The 67 models wore racing-driver jumpsuits tailored in pastel tweeds and gold lamé, and helmets emblazoned with No 5. Watching from the hotel sunloungers which stood in for the gilt chairs of Paris fashion week were both Ukrainian and Russian clients. Chanel has been the target of social media vitriol in Russia, after boutiques in Dubai refused to sell handbags to customers whom the sales staff believed were likely to take the items home to Russia, citing compliance with sanctions law. “We take sanction laws extremely seriously. The impact on our business is not what we are thinking about at this moment,” Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel’s president of fashion, said in a video call before the Monte Carlo show. “But we also have many Russian customers who live permanently abroad – in Dubai, in the Riviera, everywhere – and there is no reason that we cannot invite them to the show, along with Ukrainian clients.” The actor Kristen Stewart flew in from Los Angeles and the rapper G-Dragon from Seoul, while Princess Caroline of Monaco dropped in from her oceanfront villa nearby. Dress code on the catwalk was tongue-in-cheek pitstop glamour, with baseball caps, fingerless gloves and black-and-white chequered sweaters. There were also nods to casino culture with tiny handbags fashioned to look like slot machines and packs of playing cards. But for Chanel, which has grown its digital following during the pandemic, the audience that really matters is not the few hundred on the sunloungers, but those who the images will reach via Instagram and TikTok. Just like the drop of a new album or the release of a music video, a showcase of the cruise collection is a device to focus eyeballs all over the globe on what Chanel looks like. “In the past we were very focused on the people invited to the show, but now we are thinking just as much about the people who aren’t in the room,” Pavlovsky said. “Putting on a beautiful show is a way of nourishing the imaginary idea of what Chanel is. The guests here in Monte-Carlo are privileged, of course, but they are not the only people we think about any more.” Cruise collections, unveiled in May but not on sale until November, were originally designed for an elite needing a hot-weather wardrobe for winter sun. But they have become popular fashion content for consumers looking for inspiration for their summer holiday wardrobes. With many shoppers set to pack suitcases for the first time in three years, this cruise season is likely to be more high-profile than ever, defying predictions that international fashion shows would die out. The designer Virginie Viard collaborated with the film directors Sofia and Roman Coppola on a teaser trailer for the show, which spliced video of models wearing the new collection while reclining on speedboats with images of Grace Kelly in a tweed suit, Coco Chanel wearing a Breton stripe sweater on holiday, and Christy Turlington and Linda Evangelista wearing sequined Chanel in the Riviera. “We have learned a lot about how to maximise storytelling through digital channels,” said Pavlovsky. So strongly has demand for Chanel bounced back from the pandemic, that despite price increases of core handbag styles having far outstripped inflation, boutiques have been restricting sales to one handbag a month for each customer to keep stock on the shelves. Pavlovsky defended the price rises, which he attributed to hikes in the cost of raw materials and the costs incurred by adopting more sustainable production. “I don’t see any way to reverse this,” he said. “Things will get even more expensive.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Chanel’s Monte Carlo cruise show pays homage to racing and casinos,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/05/chanels-monte-carlo-cruise-show-pays-homage-to-racing-and-casinos
5/6/2022,"The family of a British man who has been detained in Iraq for more than six weeks and faces execution for collecting fragments of pottery at an ancient site has accused British ministers of abandoning him and expressed concern over the conditions he is being held in. Jim Fitton, 66, who was on an organised geology and archaeology trip, was arrested at Baghdad airport as he tried to fly out on suspicion of smuggling after pieces of pottery he had been assured by guides were worthless were found in his luggage. “We’re very fearful,” said Fitton’s son-in-law, Sam Tasker. “Iraqi law says if anyone is convicted of this crime, they are punishable by execution. Full stop. There’s no range or gradation of sentence, or any allowance for mitigating circumstances. By the letter of the law, if Jim is found guilty of what he is accused of, he will be executed. “Jim is giving us a rose-tinted, stiff-upper-lip view of what he is going through. He doesn’t want us to worry about him. We understand from the embassy staff and our lawyer he is getting the basics, but nobody has elaborated on the conditions. We think that’s to spare us. He’s in a temporary holding cell at the airport and has been there for six weeks with another man.” In occasional WhatsApp messages, Fitton has joked that he has learned how to clean toilets and is brushing up on his colloquial Arabic. “But it can’t be comfortable,” said Tasker. Fitton, originally from Bath and now based in Malaysia, collected the fragments from a site in Eridu. His family insist he was told they held no economic or cultural value, but he was seized as he tried to leave and is expected to face trial within a few days. Tasker said: “He’s got no criminal record. He’s a geologist jobbing around the world for 40 years. He’s a hugely experienced traveller, a wonderfully erudite man. He is the most multicultural, respectful man I’ve ever met. A crime involving devaluing the cultural history of another nation is the last thing Jim would want to do.” Tasker and Fitton’s children, Leila and Joshua, have launched a petition calling on the British government to intervene that has been signed by more than 100,000 people. The Foreign Office minister, Amanda Milling, has written to the Bath Liberal Democrat MP, Wera Hobhouse, who is championing Fitton’s case, saying the government recognises the urgency of the case and had raised concerns with Iraq over the possible imposition of the death penalty. But Tasker said more had to be done. “We need the politicians to step up. We’ve had as much support as we can get from the consular chaps on the ground. They have been visiting Jim, providing him with books to read, they’ve been compassionate. But we still haven’t had any engagement whatsoever from anyone with a decision-making power in the Foreign Office. Neither [Foreign Office ministers] James Cleverly, Amanda Milling, nor the foreign secretary [Dominic Raab] have been in touch. “We’re asking for something quite minimal. Our lawyer in Iraq has put together a proposal he wants to put to the director of public prosecutions [DPP] in Iraq. The proposal says that because of mitigating circumstances, because there was no criminal intent here, it was an honest mistake and because of Britain’s relationship with Iraq, the case should be moved to the court of cessation in Iraq. “We’ve had a crash course in Iraqi law. My understanding is that it allows for the case to be closed before it goes to sentencing and Jim would be released and allowed home. We’re asking for the Foreign Office to help us to arrange a meeting between our lawyer and the DPP in Iraq.” Tasker said he was “baffled” at the lack of engagement from the Foreign Office. “One of the Foreign Office’s roles is to look after British citizens who get into trouble. It’s incredibly frustrating.” Tasker and Leila Fitton are in Malaysia for celebrations to mark their marriage, which took place in Bath last summer. Hobhouse said Fitton should be there. “Instead he is awaiting trial in Iraq. It is an absolute travesty for Jim and his family that the Foreign Office has refused to get involved despite the family’s lawyer advising that an intervention would make a difference in this case. This is a life-or-death situation.” The Foreign Office has been asked to comment.",News/World news,Family of man at risk of execution in Iraq say Foreign Office is not helping,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/family-of-man-at-risk-of-execution-in-iraq-say-foreign-office-is-not-helping
5/6/2022,"Phineas Harper questions the rationale behind removing park benches to reduce antisocial behaviour (Removing benches, blocking cycle paths: why are police interfering in the UK’s public spaces?, 2 May). In challenging the successful Secured by Design initiative, Harper fails to consider the people who the schemes are designed to benefit – local residents. In the case of Ashford, residents have been supportive of the actions taken by partners to reduce antisocial behaviour. Coupled with proactive patrols, these actions have made the community safer. Similar initiatives elsewhere are deterring public alcohol and drug use, increasing sightlines to make safer walking routes, and improving our street scene. The government’s Safer Streets initiative, now in its fourth round of funding, has transformed our high streets and public spaces, dealt with acquisitive crime and made women and girls feel safer. Simple design principles, such as increasing CCTV, boosting street lighting and creating more safe spaces are making a tangible difference. Criticising the police, when these schemes are widely supported by local residents, councils and community groups, does nothing to make us safer.Matthew ScottPolice and crime commissioner for Kent  I was depressed to read Phineas Harper’s piece about how the police have been given powers to dictate how urban spaces are designed, with the assumption that hostile architecture might reduce criminality. Imagine that instead of police shaping shared urban spaces, it was healthcare professionals? How about instead of Secured by Design it was Livable by Design? Proposed planning would need to consider the basic needs of residents, such as adequate green space, sufficient space to socialise, air quality and the provision of active travel. Apart from making these areas more pleasant to live in, it would result in significant savings to the NHS and might even be more effective at tackling crime than simply removing park benches.Dr John LeggeDún Laoghaire, Ireland  In Reading’s Thameside Park, one of the park benches is badly run down. It was erected in 2005 by a now-defunct local Rotary club to mark the centenary of the Rotary organisation. Reading Rotary Club, of which I am a member, is currently negotiating with Reading council to have the bench renovated by the local YMCA, as part of our club’s centenary celebrations. I read Phineas Harper’s article stating that police are recommending that park benches should be done away with (because people sit on them?) with some concern. We had thought we were improving an amenity rather than encouraging crime. Is what we are doing an antisocial waste of time and money?Eric MoyseReading, Berkshire  I agree that the suggestion by police that crime in parks can be reduced by removing benches is absurd. In York, many of our public parks no longer have park attendants or gardeners due to Conservative government cuts in local authority spending. Much of the gardening and the opening and closing of our parks is done by retired people, many of whom are over 80. If the benches are removed, they will have nowhere to sit to rest after their efforts. No gardeners, no parks.Sarah SheilsYork  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
