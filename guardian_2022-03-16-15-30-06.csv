3/16/2022,"The UK could eliminate all need for imports of Russian gas this year through a combination of energy efficiency, expanding renewable power generation and a campaign to help people change their behaviour, research has found. Information campaigns played a strong role in changing people’s behaviour during the Covid-19 pandemic. Many people are unaware of the savings they could make in energy use through small changes that make no difference to their comfort but can cut bills substantially. For instance, turning down thermostats slightly and adjusting the “flow” temperature on condensing boilers could reduce annual heating bills by more than 15%. The flow temperature governs the heat of water sent to radiators but does not reduce the room temperature, and turning it down could save up to 8% of annual costs, while turning down thermostats could save about 10%. A comfortable room temperature is 18C to 21C, but many people set their thermostats at 22C or above. These measures, along with better insulation, switching to heat pumps and using more energy efficient appliances, could cut imports of Russian gas to the UK by 80% this year and save about £150 on the average household bill, according to the green thinktank E3G. The remaining 20% could be eliminated by generating more power from renewable sources, such as new windfarms and solar panels. Colm Britchfield, researcher at E3G and co-author of the report, said: “With government support, ordinary UK households can play a huge role in cutting Putin out of our energy system.” The shift can be accomplished using existing policies and mechanisms, if they were pursued more thoroughly, the research found. For example, four government initiatives that currently help insulate houses and public buildings – the local authority delivery scheme, home upgrade grant and public sector and social housing decarbonisation funds – are expected to be worth about £3.4bn from 2022 to 2025. E3G suggests that if the local authority delivery scheme alone – which supports the installation of heat pumps and energy efficiency measures for low-income households – was boosted by £1.8bn, it could cover 120,000 to 180,000 of the UK’s coldest homes. E3G’s researchers only looked at gas use, but any public information campaign could also target petrol and diesel use, as better driving habits can make a substantial difference to fuel costs. Russia is a minor supplier of gas to the UK, making up only about 3% of the market, as most of Britain’s supply comes from the North Sea and Norway, but reducing imports could help with the global effort to put pressure on Vladimir Putin. Cutting gas use would also ease the cost of living crisis amid soaring fossil fuel prices. The government is working on the final details of a new energy security strategy, to be unveiled soon, that will boost renewable energy generation and could make planning permission for windfarms easier to obtain. Separately, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will set out measures to ease the cost of living in a spring statement next Wednesday. On Monday, a group of 33 charities, thinktanks and civil society groups wrote to Boris Johnson, Sunak and the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, to call for £3.6bn for insulation grants for all households, and an extra £4bn by 2025 to install heat pumps in place of gas boilers. A government spokesperson said: “We recognise people are facing pressures with the cost of living – which is why we’re providing support with the cost of living worth over £21bn across this financial year and next ​including a £150 council tax rebate from April and a further £200 energy bill discount in October to cut energy bills quickly. “There will continue to be ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming decades while we transition to low carbon energy. We will continue to explore all options to maintain security of supply during this transition and will shortly set out our energy security strategy to supercharge our renewable energy and nuclear capacity as well as supporting our North Sea oil and gas industry.” Pedro Guertler, programme leader at E3G, said: “The UK government must act now to permanently convert fossil gas dependency and profits into reduced living costs for all. The government has the tools to make big gains on security through energy efficiency measures for households this year. We must seize the opportunity at the spring statement.”",News/Environment,"UK can eliminate need for Russian gas this year, research shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/16/uk-can-eliminate-need-for-russian-gas-this-year-research-shows
3/16/2022,"Across the years of 1983 and 84, I thought every plane going over my head contained a nuclear bomb that would be dropped, or not dropped, according to the mood of the pilot. It was an absolutely pure terror, a literal chill darting around my body, from my heart to the balls of my feet. Last week, due to the war in Ukraine, I felt that same freezing feeling for the first time in almost 40 years. The first time, I would have been about 10. Thanks to Raymond Briggs’s When the Wind Blows, the brutal 1984 apocalypse drama Threads and various clergymen-orators at CND marches, I knew a huge amount about the impact of a nuclear blast. I was all over the skin peeling, the radiation sickness, the nuclear winter, the relative horrors of being at the centre of the blast radius (ideal) or on its outer edges (you would limp on for a few weeks with your teeth falling out of your gums, creeping toward death). But I didn’t have a clue about the nuts and bolts of the matter – the fact that a nuclear war would probably be preceded by at least a small amount of conventional war, and even then, commercial airlines wouldn’t be equipped with warheads. Hilary Wainwright, a sociologist, activist and the co-editor of the socialist magazine Red Pepper, remembers her similar anxiety in the early 60s – vivid but impractical. “I was camping out in the garden at home, sleeping in this tent, I must have been eight years old, and saying, ‘I think we’d better go in, there might be a nuclear war.’ This would have been the Bay of Pigs.” That tussle for Cuba, between the US and the USSR, flourished into the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 – during which time it was quite reasonable to go to bed at night wondering if you’d see the morning. The author Michael Rosen recalls his father having anxiety dreams and that he’d woken in the night, thought the room was 45 degrees and that nuclear war had already started. Also around that time, it was commonly believed that the world had come quite close to nuclear annihilation – and this was borne out by documents released later, remembers Tariq Ali, an activist and historian. “The Cuban leadership was in a slightly crazed, ultra-left state,” he says. “When Nikita Khrushchev [the USSR’s first secretary] informed them he was going to stop the ships and withdraw the missiles, both Fidel [Castro] and Che [Guevara] said, ‘What’s it to you? Wouldn’t it be a great gain for the world? We’re prepared to sacrifice our tiny island of Cuba if it will destroy the US.’” While the cold war and the nuclear threat were very real in the 80s, very few people alive in 1962 remember that decade with anything like the same fear. “We were so terrified in 62,” says Rosen. “You just get anxiety fatigue.” The psychotherapist and author Julia Bueno, who is in her late-40s and remembers seeing When the Wind Blows in the cinema, explains why: “As a general rule, if you’ve been through a trauma, it leaves an imprint. I’ve had conversations with people around the same age as me. It’s made a lot of us a bit robust in the current situation, a bit ‘been-there-done-that’. I have spoken to people in their late 30s, who didn’t go through that, and they are so depleted and anxious, and untethered.” That resilience was hard won. If the cold war ramping up with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan on Christmas Eve 1979 was your first introduction to the nuclear prospect, the decade that followed was absolutely petrifying. Stephen Brotherstone and David Lawrence have co-authored a series of books called Scarred for Life. Volume three, Pop Culture in the Shadow of the Bomb, is out next month. “I remember that Afghanistan invasion – I was 10,” says Brotherstone. “I didn’t know what it meant, but I saw what it meant to my mum – she started crying. After that, there was this revolving door of Russian premiers, all of whom seemed mad. It was the Reagan era of tough-guy politics. By 83 and 84, it felt that nuclear war was going to happen. Not could happen, but was going to.” The academic and activist Mary Kaldor was a towering figure in the British peace movement and one of the founders of End (the campaign for European Nuclear Disarmament). “What I think is really weird about nuclear weapons is that we go through phases of worrying about them intensely, and then we can’t bear to think about it any more, so we just stop,” she says. That cycle has been there since the invention of the bomb and the second-world-war-ending first deployment in Japan. There have been times when the threat completely eroded popular trust in government, and the fear permeated everything, from civil society to culture. In the 50s and 60s, being a peacenik didn’t disbar you from the mainstream; there was a folk troubadour tradition, embodied by the likes of Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan. But active anti-death proselytising was considered subversive and niche – Pete Seeger and the Weavers ended up disbanding after they were brought in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee in the US. Essentially, as far as the US was concerned, not wanting to be annihilated made you a communist (although, to be fair, they were pinko-adjacent). In the 80s, however, there were pop songs, comedy sketches and even board games about nuclear war. Brotherstone and Lawrence have made an apocalypse Top 10, whittled down from 100 chart-toppers about the bomb. “Strawberry Switchblade, a young couple deciding on suicide after a nuclear war,” Lawrence says. “UB40, The Earth Dies Screaming,” Brotherstone adds, “David Bowie, Eve of Destruction, a song from the second-most depressing film of all time, When the Wind Blows. Ultravox, Dancing With Tears in My Eyes – the video is about him rushing home to be with his wife and kid before they’re vaporised.” “The Specials, of course,” Lawrence adds, “with Man at C&A” (this begins with the line, “Warning, warning, nuclear attack”). “Men at Work did a song about a lower-ranking army offer and his nuclear anxiety, and accidental nuclear attack,” Lawrence continues. Brotherstone adds, “I only found out recently that in Nik Kershaw’s I Won’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me, the sun he refers to is the flash of the mushroom cloud. Then Kate Bush did a song about an unborn child’s thoughts as it floats in its mother’s womb, wondering whether it’s going to be born into a world of radiation and death.” In with a bullet at No 1: Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Two Tribes. It’s video is a parody of the Protect and Survive public information campaign. The writer Charlie Brooker was an absolutely top-tier nuclear neurotic in the 80s, but remembers as a child being comforted that people could laugh at the idea of a nuclear war. “If they’re making jokes about nuclear war on Spitting Image, it’s going to be OK,” he says. That is until he became a satirist himself. “I remember doing the 2016 Screenwipe, after Trump had been elected but before he’d been inaugurated – he started casually talking about a nuclear bomb. I was in the position then that Spitting Image was in when I was a kid – funny and reassuring, saying: ‘It’s all sort of going to be OK.’ But I was shitting myself.” Meanwhile, a brief timeline of civil society: in the 50s, those who opposed nuclear weapons had a huge battle just to get the atrocities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki recognised. Rosen says governments internationally “pretty successfully sat on the effects – the immediate impact and the half-life were concealed by huge effort”. Nuclear testing on Christmas Island, the release of strontium-90 and the possible cancers it could cause, subsequent birth defects across the Polynesian islands, all this information went through a tango of suppression by authorities then awareness-raising by peace activists. Before the Cuban missile crisis, there was also fear a war might be triggered by accident – a flock of geese alerting a missile defence system, or a power station blowing up (given Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island, these hypotheses were ahead of their time). Early peace activists Canon Collins, the first chair of the CND, and Bertrand and Dora Russell were preoccupied by the idea of accidental war. They were part of a drive to disrupt the cosy consensus that a nuclear war couldn’t possibly happen because it would simply be too dreadful. In 1962, however, the phrase “mutually assured destruction” was coined and became military doctrine over that decade – the idea that neither side had the incentive either to escalate or disarm, so holding nuclear weapons was safe, actually. “Before the fully articulated MAD proposal,” Rosen says, “you would get people claiming that we could have a limited nuclear war and win it.” That (completely deranged) idea was given new energy in the Reagan era with the notion of a great nuclear shield, which would allow the US to nuke the USSR without a counterattack (would it shield Europe as well? Not so much). In the UK in the early 60s, a group of august peace activists – the Committee of 100 – uncovered the Regional Seats of Government (RSGs), advanced governmental contingency planning to keep things ticking over in the event of nuclear war. This unleashed a tide of anxiety that didn’t recede until the 90s – a government that was readying itself, with miles of secret underground bunkers, plainly wasn’t trustworthy and possibly didn’t have its citizens’ interests at the heart of its decision-making. In 1980, Protect and Survive emerged, a series of pamphlets, radio scripts and 20 short public information films which were only to be shown if a war was thought likely within the subsequent 72 hours. Of course, they were leaked to the media just after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and they were full of terrifyingly granular details – what a four-minute warning would sound like, which bit of your house would work best as a fallout room, “life under fallout conditions”, and yet they were also kind of nonsensical. In what conceivable world would taking a door off its hinges and leaning it against your dining room table protect you from a nuclear blast? Theories swirled that these were all strategic displacement activities, just to keep people busy so they didn’t rush the politicians’ own bomb shelter network. Details of such doors were published in panicky books such as Beneath the Streets by Peter Laurie in 1979, which identifies secret doors to the RSG tunnels. One of them was on Kingsway, which runs from High Holborn to Aldwych in the centre of London. I remember passing it on a march and someone pointing it out, the portal to the postapocalypse underworld. Trust in political authority was, understandably, low. Unless you were going to go the way of the Swiss – where neutrality was pledged and it had been mandatory since 1963 to have capacity for its entire population in fallout shelters – it’s hard to be open with a population about a plan which will see most of them die. It was difficult to distinguish fact (those bunkers were real) from fiction (were night trains carrying nuclear waste?). But just because you were a conspiracy theorist didn’t mean the government wasn’t out to get you. For a generation, peace marches became a family event. The first of the famous Aldermaston marches took place in 1958, covering a tremendous distance, from Trafalgar Square to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment about 50 miles away in Berkshire. Rosen “ran away from home to go on the 1960 march, which was a joke, because Mum and Dad were going anyway. My mother, as a good Jewish mother, was saying, ‘You can’t go, you can’t go! Don’t forget the raisins!” Kaldor was on the second march, aged 10: “We went on a lorry that said, ‘we want to live’.” Even those who didn’t attend Aldermaston marches found that they shaped their understanding of collective action and protest: “CND was a formative moment. It shaped a lot of our political awareness,” Wainwright says. “A sense that the world was in a really bad place.” But, she says, “the most important thing was Greenham [this was 1981]. Ordinary – well, extraordinary – women in Cardiff were so worried about nuclear weapons that they decided they couldn’t let it happen. So they marched to [the RAF base in the Berkshire parish of] Greenham, and set up this camp, which then became the most potent focal point, particularly for women in the movement.” It was galvanising for the activists. I went as a kid and found it paralysing. You’d get the bus from Newbury station, and other passengers would be wearing badges saying “RAGE” (Residents Against Greenham Extremists) – I remember a woman with her grey hair in a centre parting staring at me and my sister with naked hatred. Then you’d arrive, and all the talk was of apocalypse. Looking back, the Greenham women were effectively on a domestic strike; some of them brought their kids, most of them didn’t. If they were there, it had to mean something. Nobody was really in the mood for small talk. But the great untold story of the CND, and this is even more true about End, is that it had a seismic impact on policy. Kaldor has told me about a senior figure in the Reagan administration who said they borrowed a disarmament demand from the placards of an End demonstration, because it was so extreme the USSR would have to refuse it: then Gorbachev accepted it, which was the beginning of the end of the cold war. This week, she’s more dispirited: “The American peace movement was very focused on nuclear weapons. We focused on ending the cold war. And in that sense, we were very successful, but maybe we could have pushed further.” Then, as if by magic, the fear vanished. It left no trace as we hurtled into the carefree 90s, because remembering it was just too heavy. By the time Jeremy Corbyn was leader of the Labour party, Kaldor points out we were at the stage of denial where “he was attacked for saying, if he had to press the button, he would think very carefully about it. Apparently you’re not supposed to think very carefully, you’re supposed to just do it.” Yet the weapons never disappeared, and nor did the fear. It all lay dormant, waiting to be poked awake by another madman.",News/World news,"‘By 10, I knew all about the impact of a nuclear blast’: growing up in the shadow of the bomb",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/by-10-i-knew-all-about-the-impact-of-a-nuclear-blast-growing-up-in-the-shadow-of-the-bomb
3/16/2022,"Silicon Valley executives will no longer be the “supreme arbiters” of online speech, according to the culture secretary, as the government prepares to publish reformed legislation to tackle online abuse. Nadine Dorries said “unelected” tech leaders had become some of the most powerful people in the world due to a lack of robust regulation, adding that the situation will change under the online safety bill. This imposes a duty of care on tech companies to protect users from harmful content. A revised version will be published on Thursday. “Unelected Silicon Valley execs have become some of the most powerful people in the world,” Dorries wrote in an article on the ConservativeHome website. “They decide who gets to speak online, and who is silenced or cancelled from public life. That prospect should concern anyone who truly cares about free speech.” Dorries said she was responding to criticism from a “group of MPs and journalists” that the bill will give Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg unlimited power to censor online expression. The bill, which focuses on platforms that host user-generated content such as Facebook, Twitter and TikTok, requires companies to prevent the proliferation of illegal content such as child sexual abuse and terrorist material. It also mandates the biggest tech firms to protect adults from legal but harmful content such as cyberbullying. The legal but harmful clause has given rise to concerns that it might result in excessive censorship by social media platforms, which face hefty fines by the communications watchdog, Ofcom, for breaches of the act. Dorries said the bill will have “considerably stronger protections for free speech” when it is published in revised form this week, after the publication of draft legislation last year. Under the bill, journalistic content will be exempt from removal, and content of “democratic importance”, which is partly designed to protect political discourse and expression, will also be protected. “We would never pursue legislation that threatens freedom of expression … nor can we maintain the current status quo, where a handful of west coast execs are the supreme arbiters of online speech,” said Dorries. The government has already announced that the revised bill will include new criminal offences covering cyberflashing, threatening social media posts and the publishing of hoax bomb threats. It will also require that online platforms protect users from fraudulent adverts and will order commercial pornography sites to carry out age checks on people trying to access their content. Privacy campaigners have described the new age-verification policy as a “privacy minefield” and have warned that it could establish the principle of age-gating across the internet.

3/16/2022,"Should we plough up Britain? Many people seem to think so. Even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, food prices were rocketing. Now they have reached an all-time record. The National Farmers’ Union of Scotland has called for Scotland’s feeble environmental measures – paying farmers to plant hedges, cover crops and introduce beetle banks – to be rescinded, so that food production can be maximised. Others insist that rewilding is a luxury we can no longer afford. It is true that the world now faces a major food crisis. Climate breakdown has begun to bite. Heat domes and droughts in North America and storms and floods in Europe and China last year damaged harvests and drove up prices. By February, the cost of food was 20% higher than a year earlier. Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia produce nearly 30% of the world’s wheat exports, 15% of the maize (corn) and 75% of the sunflower oil. Altogether, they generate about 12% of the calories traded internationally. Ukrainian farmers are desperately short of fuel and fertiliser. Much of the labour force is now fighting the Russian army, or has been forced to flee. Anything Ukraine manages to produce will be consumed at home. Anyway, the ports are blockaded. Russia might ban grain exports, as it did in 2010, helping to cause a major price spike in 2011. This threat has prompted other countries – Hungary, Turkey, Argentina and China – to restrict their own exports. Even more ominously, just as European countries allowed themselves to become hooked on Russian gas and oil, they are also highly reliant on Russian and Belarusian fertilisers. About one-third of the nitrogen and two-thirds of the potassium imported by the UK and western Europe come from Russia and Belarus, and we can expect them to use this dependency as another economic weapon. The war could raise global food prices by a further 20% this year, and that’s assuming no further climate or pandemic disasters. Every increment ensures that more people go hungry. The Middle East and north Africa are highly reliant on Ukrainian and Russian grain. Almost 40% of Yemen’s wheat is grown in Russia and Ukraine. Already, millions there are close to starvation. Egypt, the world’s largest wheat importer, relies on the warring countries for roughly 70% of its imports. So does this mean we should plough our own furrow? About one-third of the UK’s agricultural land is “croppable”, and almost all of it is in use. The call to plant more land is similar to the call by rightwing Tory MPs to resume fracking: the environmental damage would greatly outweigh the tiny increment of production. And we do nothing to release ourselves from the vicissitudes of the global market if we reduce our imports of food by increasing imports of fertiliser. As for rewilding, most advocates argue it should take place on a large scale only on unproductive land. There are vast areas in the uplands of Britain that produce remarkably little: the National Food Strategy reports that in England 20% of the farmland produces just 3% of our calories. The ratio is likely to be even starker in Wales and Scotland. If this land were rewilded, the contribution it would make to preventing climate and ecological breakdown, both of which severely threaten global food supply, would probably be far greater than the contribution it makes to feeding us directly. Rewilding is not a luxury we can’t afford. It’s an ecological necessity. I’ve heard some people compare the current situation with the second world war, during which, they claim, the UK became self-sufficient. This, of course, is a myth. While, through intense and remarkable efforts, the UK raised its production to become 75% sufficient in food (today we are 62% sufficient, by value) wheat imports from Canada, to give just one example, rose from 20% to 83% of our supply, as exports from western Europe were cut off. So is there something meaningful we could do? Yes: ensure that our scarce arable land is used to feed people rather than to fuel cars or power stations. Despite the global food crisis that has been developing now for seven years, the UK and other European countries have cheerfully been diverting some of their best arable land from food to fuel production. Between 2019 and 2021, farmers in England raised the area of land used to make biogas by an astonishing 19%. Now 120,000 hectares (300,000 acres) is ploughed to grow maize and hybrid rye for biogas, which is marketed, misleadingly, as a green alternative to fossil gas. The reopening of a bioethanol plant in Hull that will turn wheat into fuel for cars is likely to take another 130,000 hectares out of food production. Between them, these energy crops demand 9% of the land used to grow cereals in England. This is an astonishingly destructive and inefficient business. About 450 hectares of land is needed to feed a biogas plant with a capacity of one megawatt. By contrast, a megawatt of wind turbine capacity requires only one-third of a hectare. When you include the impacts of soil erosion, for which maize in particular is notorious, the climate costs are likely to be worse than those of fossil gas. This good land would make a far greater contribution to food production than it can to energy production. Needless to say, the National Farmers’ Union of Scotland, so keen to grub up hedges and beetle banks to grow more food, has for years been encouraging its members to produce crops for biogas plants, which inevitably means reducing the amount of food they grow. If we were serious about reducing the pressure on global food supply, we would also switch to a plant-based diet. Were everyone to do so, the agricultural land needed to feed the world would decline by 75%. Even though our direct consumption of grain would rise, the total arable area would fall by 19%, because animals would no longer need to be fed on crops. Food security and food nationalism are by no means the same thing, and in some cases polar opposites. But our global food system is fragile and highly vulnerable to shocks. It requires complete transformation, of the kind I propose in Regenesis, published in May. Ploughing the few small corners where wildlife persists is not the answer.

3/16/2022,"The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will deliver a virtual address to the US Congress on Wednesday, the latest in a series of speeches to western leaders as he works to galvanize support for his besieged nation. The remarks to both chambers of Congress come on day 21 of the battle for Ukraine’s survival under an intensifying assault from Russia. Russian troops are advancing on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in a war that has already killed hundreds of civilians in aerial and artillery bombardment, including at least 100 children. More than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion, causing the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war. Zelenskiy’s speech follows similar addresses to the UK parliament, in which he invoked Shakespeare and echoed Winston Churchill’s famous wartime oration to the House of Commons about defiance in the face of an apparently overwhelming aggressor. On Tuesday, Zelenskiy appealed to Canada’s parliament, and the nation’s large Ukrainian diaspora, to rally behind his country. That evening, the prime ministers of Nato allies and Russian neighbors Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia traveled by train to Kyiv, which was under a 35-hour curfew as Russian shells and missiles rained down on the capital, striking residential areas and civilian infrastructure. It came on the same day Zelenskiy acknowledged that Ukraine’s longstanding hope of joining Nato was unlikely. “For years, we heard about the apparently open door, but have already also heard that we will not enter there, and these are truths and must be acknowledged,” the Ukrainian president said in a speech before the leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force, a UK-led initiative bringing together 10 north Atlantic countries to create a capability for responding rapidly to crises. In his remarks on Wednesday, which will come nearly two weeks after Zelenskiy met virtually, behind the scenes, with a small group of members of Congress, he is expected to call on the US once again to “close the skies” over Ukraine. He is also likely to press to be supplied with fighter jets by Nato allies that Ukrainian pilots can fly up against Russian air forces, and steeper economic sanctions in the face of an advancing Russian assault. The Biden administration has so far flatly ruled out an option of the west imposing a no-fly zone over the country, determined to avoid inevitable direct combat between the US and Russian forces – a conflict the US president has said would lead to “world war three”. The Biden administration also rejected an offer from Poland to turn over its Soviet-era fighter jets to Ukraine, which had been made only if the US and Nato facilitated the transfer. Administration officials argued the move could be seen as escalatory by Moscow. But Biden is facing growing pressure to reconsider his position. A growing chorus of lawmakers on Capitol Hill are publicly pressuring Biden to increase military aid to Ukraine, including sending fighter jets and air defense systems. The calls come as the US and allies tighten their economic vice on Russia, apparently leading Moscow to turn to China for financial support. On Tuesday, Biden signed into law a funding measure that will provide a record $13.6bn in emergency aid to Ukraine and its European allies. This week, lawmakers are expected to take up legislation that would end normal trade relations with Russia after Biden last Friday said the US would join Europe and other allies in revoking its preferred trade status. Biden will travel to the Belgian capital, Brussels, next week for a meeting with Nato leaders to discuss the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and reassure allies of the US’s commitment to the defense alliance. “His goal is to meet in person, face-to-face with his European counterparts and talk about where we are at this point in the conflict in the invasion of Ukraine by Russia,” the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said on Tuesday. She added: “We’ve been incredibly aligned to date – that doesn’t happen by accident. The president is a big believer in face-to-face diplomacy, so it’s an opportunity to do exactly that.”",News/US news,Zelenskiy to address US Congress and call for tougher line against Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/16/zelenskiy-address-us-congress-ukraine-russia
3/16/2022,"In the summer of 2020, a month after the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston was toppled and three months after George Floyd was murdered outside a convenience store in Minneapolis, I gave a lecture about race and racism, diversity and inclusion within the television industry. I used that platform, the James MacTaggart Memorial Lecture, to tell the story of how for decades TV has failed not only to address its diversity problem but, at times, even to acknowledge that it has one. On the small screen – as in the worlds of art, publishing, theatre and film – who gets their stories told and who gets to do the telling have never been based on talent and passion alone. Television is an old medium with a long established internal culture, one that developed over the decades and from the outset was exclusive rather than inclusive. The BBC that emerged in the 1920s very much reflected the class-bound society that had spawned it. Early television was dominated by London, and its programmes were largely produced and presented by members of a middle-class elite. Despite the much publicised relocation of various broadcasters and production companies to the regions, a century after British broadcasting began, when we picture a television producer we still do not think of someone with a regional accent from a working-class background. Those people from wealthy backgrounds, who attended private schools and elite universities, are sometimes described in the culture of television recruitment as being from “traditional backgrounds”. The backgrounds of people such as myself, from council estates and failing comprehensive schools, are tellingly described as “non-traditional”. Putting words out into the world, as I did that summer, can have unpredictable effects. One of which was that it helped a group of people – with whom I now work – to devise an initiative that aims to influence the development of a new medium. This year, as well as working in television, I am engaged in StoryTrails, an initiative led by StoryFutures Academy, the UK’s National Centre for Immersive Storytelling at Royal Holloway, University of London. The new medium in which we are working is the metaverse – the 3D internet that uses virtual reality (VR) to create new worlds inside a headset, and augmented reality (AR), which adds layers of digital imagery to the real world, that can be seen through your smartphone. A new medium arrives in the world with no history and, to an extent, no cultural baggage. Women working in the technology sector might challenge the idea that technologies created in such a male-dominated space are completely baggage-free. However, the newness of these technologies means there is the potential to ensure that those who create the metaverse are not defined as being either “traditional” or “non-traditional”. The original sins of Britain’s television and film industries – their exclusivity, their metropolitan focus, their tendency to privilege middle-class outlooks and their long histories of misogyny – should and potentially can be left behind, and prevented from infecting VR and AR and the employment cultures that will develop around them. This dream of inscribing a new and better creative culture is why our StoryTrails project is placing these new technologies into the hands of 50 creatives from across the country whose backgrounds reflect the diversity of UK talent. They are tasked with creating immersive stories that enable audiences to experience history, touch it, feel it and interact with it where it happened. Using film archive from the BFI, reimagined and transformed into stunning 3D, they will give audiences in Blackpool a chance to ride on the “Queercoaster”, an augmented reality journey through Blackpool’s LGBTQ+ history. People in Sheffield, meanwhile, will see how their city is becoming one of the greenest in the UK, thanks to large-screen immersive domes showing how it is throwing off its reputation for heavy industry and smokey skies. StoryTrails will be part of this year’s Unboxed festival – billed as a nationwide celebration of creativity but originally labelled “the festival of Brexit”. Whatever the government’s original ambitions, if the festival currently being created by teams of artists across the UK were the latter rather than the former, not only would I not be involved, I’d be among its most ardent critics. Although the ambition of StoryTrails is to prevent the new cultures around immersive technologies from repeating the mistakes of TV and film, that does not mean they have nothing to learn from older creative industries. Every book written on the history of television in the UK in the end reaches the same conclusion: that what makes British television special is the tradition of public service broadcasting, an ethos that emerged as radio and then television evolved in the UK from 1922 onwards. That tradition matured within the early BBC and was later transmitted to the new independent television companies that appeared in the 1950s, and from there to Channel 4, born three decades after that. Public service broadcasting has been about making content available to everybody irrespective of where they live. In a UK made up of four nations, it has been about shared histories but also divergent experiences. It has sought to forge a sense of national identity while celebrating cultural difference. It has attempted to bring content together in ways that do not presume limitations, and to foster the potential for serendipity and the broadening of horizons. This appeal to universality has, at its best, not been achieved at the expense of minority communities and minority voices. British television, particularly in the early years of Channel 4, offered unique spaces and platforms to minority communities and parts of the UK distant (both geographically and culturally) from London. In 2022, with disinformation surging throughout the world, and a Russian army encircling Kyiv while Putin’s state television convinces millions of Russians that Ukraine is the aggressor, public service broadcasting is more valuable than ever, and something we are perhaps beginning to appreciate more than we have in previous decades. The 3D internet is very different from traditional television but inherent to them both – in very different ways – is a relationship to geography. Among the BBC’s greatest contributions to public life in Britain is local broadcasting – both television and radio. The 3D internet has the potential to be local in new, unique and extraordinary ways. The 3D internet is able to take digital storytelling and overlay it on to real physical spaces. The overwhelming majority of people in the UK own a smartphone, through which it is possible to add virtual layers of augmented reality on to the places that are parts of our everyday lives. Already, 63% of us use AR via social media platforms on a regular basis. This new way of seeing has the potential to enrich our relationship to real physical spaces – in particular to shared public spaces. The 3D internet, with its capacity to stamp history virtually on to geography and create hybrid physical-digital experiences, is about opening up virtual public spaces. It asks what the new public spaces of a 3D internet will be. What will be the equivalent of the public forum, the market, the plaza? Where will we meet each other and where will we forge communities? Over the past two years, something unique in modern history has happened to our public spaces. As a new disease forced us inwards, deeper into our own personal lives, our shared public spaces have been left intermittently empty. Our ancestors experienced similar moments during past epidemics, when city streets and public squares were placed out of bounds. But for us in the modern world – a world with 7 billion inhabitants, the majority of whom for the first time in human history live in cities – the recent silence that hung over streets and public spaces was a new, unwelcome and disorientating experience. The idea behind StoryTrails is that our 50 creatives will use the new technologies to help their communities reconnect to public spaces across the UK. They will do this by reanimating forgotten moments from our history, using the 3D internet to stamp that history virtually on to the places where it occurred. Windrush Square in Brixton will be occupied by the digital voices of people such as Olive Morris, a pioneer in the fight for racial equality back in the 1970s. Or in Omagh, the story of that town’s first gay pride will be similarly told using AR. While our public spaces – the places where ideas and opinions were historically shared – have been closed for much of the pandemic, our metaphorical public squares, our online spaces, have similarly closed in upon themselves. They have become walled gardens of personal preference. The age of the algorithm and the culture wars has created personalised echo chambers – the diametric opposite of the civic ethos behind both the traditional public square, public service broadcasting, and our unique creative industries in the UK.

This year two former winners, Sydney Smith and Emily Gavett, are in with a chance of a third medal. Also on the shortlist are Mariachiara Di Giorgio and Peter Van den Ende, who have both illustrated wordless books about nature and animals. And Danica Novgorodoff has been selected for the graphic novel version of Long Way Down by Jason Reynolds, who won the Carnegie medal last year for Look Both Ways. The prizes are judged by school librarians, and the Carnegie has previously been won by Noel Streatfeild and Philip Pullman, while the Kate Greenaway has been awarded to many much-loved illustrators including Quentin Blake and Janet Ahlberg. This year, six of the eight books on the Carnegie shortlist are based on real-world events: from Mann’s tale of teenagers brought together by the refugee crisis to Sue Divin’s novel about the lasting impact of the Troubles, Guard Your Heart. Poet and activist Dr Yusef Salaam reflects directly on his own experience in Punching the Air, a novel in verse co-written with New York Times-bestselling author Ibi Zoboi. Salaam is a member of “the Exonerated Five” – the Black and Latino teenagers who were wrongly accused of assault and rape in the Central Park jogger case. Social issues are explored in the Greenaway shortlist too, with Long Way Down looking at teenage gang violence and grief, while artist George Butler documents the true stories of migrants in his debut picture book Drawn Across Borders. Jennifer Horan, chair of judges for both awards, said she hopes the 16 books “will excite, move and empower the young readers who pick them up”. She added: “I’m thrilled that our Yoto Carnegie shortlist showcases how friendship can help young people find the strength to navigate a path through challenging times. We’re also delighted to celebrate the power of pictures, not only on the Yoto Kate Greenaway list but in a couple of Carnegie titles too. Many of our shortlisted books remind us that art can help us to communicate and connect with young people when words sometimes fail us.” The winners of both awards, as well as the winners selected by groups of children “shadowing” the judging process, will be announced on 16 June.",Arts/Books,Carnegie medal shortlist spotlights real-life stories of friendship in challenging times,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/16/carnegie-medal-prize-shortlist
3/16/2022,"Truth Social, Donald Trump’s new social media network, was supposed to be “a major new platform” where Republicans and Democrats alike could converse in an environment free from the “censorship” of big tech, an environment with an “ironclad commitment to protecting vigorous debate”. Instead, nearly a month after its launch, Truth Social has become a laughingstock, marked by a botched rollout, a share price collapse and, in Trump, a figurehead who doesn’t actually post much to his own social media platform. The network, born out of Trump being banned from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube due to the risk of the former president inciting violence, was due to launch on 21 February, five months after Trump announced its creation in a typically hyperbolic statement. “We live in a world where the Taliban has a huge presence on Twitter, yet your favorite American president has been silenced. This is unacceptable,” Trump said. “I’m excited to soon begin sharing my thoughts on TRUTH Social and to fight back against Big Tech.” When the launch date came round, however, tens of thousands of people were unable to access Truth Social. The Guardian attempted to sign up on 21 February and was finally granted access on 5 March. And almost a month after the launch, Trump has so far shared only one thought to the platform; a boilerplate message in mid-February urging people to “Get ready!”. Unsurprisingly, Trump is said to be unhappy with his new social media network. According to the Daily Beast, people close to Trump “have heard the former president on the phone swearing gratuitously and asking things like: ‘What the fuck is going on’” with Truth Social. Trump is said to be particularly piqued by the sluggish rollout – some would-be Truth Social users are still waiting to get on to the platform – and upset that Truth Social is not more popular. The former president’s anger is not unfounded. In early March the network was averaging just 300,000 visits each day, according to the Daily Beast. Truth Social spent 21-23 February as the most downloaded app on the Apple app store, according to Similarweb, but by 12 March it was only the 173rd most popular app. But the problems with Truth Social go deeper than the fact that barely anyone uses it. At the time of writing, there is no way to use Truth Social on a webpage, with a user forced to download the app to their phone. That only works, however, if they have an iPhone, because Truth Social is not yet available as a Google app. Shared links to individual Truth Social posts bring up an error message. The site itself is barely distinguishable from Twitter, one of the “tech titans” that Trump railed against when he launched Truth Social. Posts on the platform are called “truths”, and when visiting people’s profiles, users can see their “truths and replies” – Twitter enables people to view “tweets and replies”. Unlike Twitter, the Truth Social app is sluggish, while the list of profiles suggested to new users is thin at best – largely because, as Politico reported: “Many major players in the conservative world aren’t on the app.” The missing major players appear to include the rightwing media figures Steve Bannon, Glenn Beck and Tucker Carlson, as well as Trump’s sometime lawyer Rudy Giuliani. (There is a @RudyGiuliani account on TruthSocial, but it has just 35 followers and is unverified.) The big-name conservatives who have joined don’t seem to be seeing much reward. According to Truth Social Sean Hannity has 266,000 on the platform, but the Fox News host’s “truths” are struggling for engagement. Hannity posted several truths on Tuesday morning; more than four hours later one post had been liked by 10 people, another by just nine. Trump’s one truth has been liked 86,000 times, and received 13,000 replies, although many of those appear to be spam postings advertising a niche conservative cryptocurrency. There is little evidence of political diversity on Truth Social, despite Trump’s promise that the platform would be a “big tent” filled with people of “all political stripes, and all different viewpoints”. Whether an echo chamber of rightwing voices proves an attractive proposition to Truth Social’s users remains to be seen. But while Trump lovers might be willing to put up with a clunky, Twitter-aping platform, and – to date – a dearth of content, a bigger problem might be that Truth Social is far from the free speech utopia Trump promised. “We find ourselves being censored and dictated to by a small group of self-righteous scolds and self-appointed arbiters of what everyone else is allowed to think, say, share, and do,” Trump said in a press release in October. “We will not silence our fellow citizens simply because they might be wrong – or worse, because we think that Americans ‘can’t handle the truth’.” But a review of Truth Social’s terms of service reveals a comprehensive list of things people can and cannot do and say on the platform. Users’ posts should not contain “profanity, or abusive or racist, language”, according to Truth Social’s rules. Posts should also “not contain discriminatory references based on religion, race, gender, national origin, age, marital status, sexual orientation, or disability”. Truth Social also reserves the right to “refuse, restrict access to, limit the availability of, or disable” anyone’s posts. People should also not make contributions which are “false, inaccurate, or misleading”, which could prove a problem for a site founded by a man who continues to lie about the accuracy of the 2020 presidential election. To Truth Social’s credit, however, its terms of service do provide an avenue for users to get in touch, should they have any issue with these draconian rules. Truth Social even provides a physical address where users can direct their complaints, and it seems that those complaints will go right to the top. The address is in Palm Beach, Florida, at 1100 South Ocean Blvd. Specifically, it is the address of Mar-a-Lago, the private members club and vacation resort where Trump has lived since leaving the White House.",News/Media,Truth Social: the failing anti-Twitter platform even Trump barely uses,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/16/truth-social-donald-trump-failing-anti-twitter-platform
3/16/2022,"The first day of meteorological spring has passed, but spring pays little heed to the calendar; it tiptoes in with hesitant steps. Hazel catkins, early this year and battered by February’s storms, have withered already; snowdrops are mud-spattered by heavy rain; lesser celandine flowers open as the sun melts overnight frost. And now, curlews are returning to the dale. I could hear their plaintive calls well before they appeared over the pines – more than 40 birds, a heartening, joyous sighting of a red-listed species that is becoming scarcer. They wheeled in a wide circle, dangling long legs in their steep descent into the sheep pasture, landing with a few quick running steps before regaining their poise and probing for worms with elegant curved bills. Soon they will separate into smaller groups and move higher on the fells. Then their courtship flights, long glides trailing the liquid notes of their bubbling calls across the landscape, provide haunting, soul-stirring music in the North Pennine uplands. But for now they feed in a large flock, perhaps for mutual security. Their cryptic, mottled brown plumage blends well with muddy grass and molehills and I might not have noticed them if I hadn’t seen them land. They are wary. One bird rises, settles again, and the whole flock turns to look towards the pines. Suddenly there are yelping alarm calls and they are all airborne. Two mewing buzzards appear, scavengers that present little threat, especially as they are preoccupied in their own courtship, but the curlews take no chances. It’s quiet again, with only the sound of wind through the pines, but not for long. I hear loud, exultant, piping calls – a flyby flock of recently returned oystercatchers, immaculate pied plumage sullied a little by mud clinging to their scarlet beaks. They, too, have come to feed in these pastures, before dispersing along the valley. The Nobel laureate novelist Sinclair Lewis once memorably described countryside in spring as “hysteric with new life”. We haven’t reached that point yet, but today it felt as though winter was loosening its grip and those hesitant steps are gathering unstoppable pace.
