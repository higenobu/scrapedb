2/3/2022,"Christian groups have accused Scott Morrison of “betraying” the intent of the Coalition’s religious discrimination bill by announcing an amendment that would prevent students being expelled for their sexuality or gender. Morrison made the surprise announcement on Brisbane radio on Thursday morning in a bid to distance the federal government from Citipointe Christian College’s attempt to get families to sign an anti-gay and anti-trans enrolment contract. The school has now withdrawn the contracts.  Morrison pledged in October 2018 he would prevent LGBTQ+ students from being expelled but the reform was never implemented because it would still have allowed religious schools to discriminate against LGBTQ+ students in other ways. A group of four moderate Liberals had demanded an exemption allowing religious schools to discriminate be removed from the Sex Discrimination Act at the same time as the religious discrimination bill was passed. But the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, subsequently appeared to renege on that purported deal, telling Christian lobby group FamilyVoice in mid-December that changes to protect LGBTQ+ students would have to wait for 12 months and a review. As recently as Wednesday evening, the assistant attorney general, Amanda Stoker, had said amendments to protect children would be dealt with separately to the religious bill. But on Thursday, Morrison told B105.3 radio that he did not support Citipointe’s attempt to get families to sign statements that homosexual acts were “immoral” and “offensive to God” and that transgender people would not be recognised. “My kids go to a Christian school, I wouldn’t want my school doing that either,” Morrison said. “The bill we’re going to be taking through the parliament, we will have an amendment that will deal with that to ensure kids cannot be discriminated against on that basis. I’ve been saying that for years. That’s always been my view.” Morrison added that schools “should be able to teach kids” consistently with their faith – whether they be Christian, Muslim or Jewish. He said the religious discrimination bill would protect Australians “whether they have a faith or they don’t”. Guardian Australia understands Morrison told Liberal moderates and wrote to the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, in early December stating he would introduce the amendment that would change the SDA. “In keeping with my second reading speech, where I stated that there is no place in our education system for any form of discrimination against a student on the basis of the sexuality of gender identity, the government will move an amendment to remove the provisions of the [SDA] which were included in 2013 which limited the protections provided under this Act,” Morrison wrote to Albanese on 1 December. FamilyVoice reacted with fury on Thursday, with spokesperson Greg Bondar telling Guardian Australia the proposed amendment was “inconsistent” with Cash’s commitment to the group. “Scott Morrison has betrayed the foundation of the religious discrimination bill,” he said. “Morrison has fallen into the same trap as Bill Shorten in 2019, ignoring the voice of the Christian community.” Bondar also complained about Citipointe’s backdown, defending the school for “simply wanting to uphold scientific truth and the Christian worldview of human sexuality”. “This is a sad day for all Australians and particularly faith schools as it has put religious freedom and free speech at risk,” he said. The Australian Christian Lobby and Christian Schools Australia have both previously threatened to withdraw their support for the religious discrimination bill if amendments regarding LGBTQ+ students were added. National LGBTQ+ rights organisation, Equality Australia, cautiously welcomed the commitment but still called for the bill to be scrapped. Ghassan Kassisieh, the legal director at Equality Australia, said the proposed reform was “long overdue and better protections must apply to both teachers and students”. “But the Morrison government’s religious discrimination bill will invite exactly this type of practice in employment across faith-based organisations, from schools, aged-care services, emergency accommodation and hospitals,” he said. “The prime minister may be putting out one small fire, but [the bill] will unleash a firestorm of discrimination in religious organisations against anyone that holds a different belief from their faith-based employer – even when they can faithfully do the job that is required of them.” Just Equal spokesperson Rodney Croome said an amendment to the SDA would be pointless because the religious discrimination bill broadened the scope for faith schools to discriminate against LGBTQ+ students and teachers on the grounds of religious belief. “As the actions by Citipointe Christian College clearly show, there are faith-schools camouflaging discrimination against LGBTIQ+ students by invoking religious beliefs rather than discriminating directly on the grounds of sexuality or gender identity,” he said. The text of the proposed amendment is yet to be released and Morrison has not committed to preventing teachers being fired for their sexuality – despite claiming in November it had also “always” been his view they should not. On Friday, two parliamentary inquiries into the religious discrimination bill are due to report before a short parliamentary sitting in which Labor support would probably be required to pass the proposed legislation. In both committees, the Coalition and Labor are collaborating with the aim of writing a joint report, but Labor could go further in expressing significant concerns about the statements of belief clause and expanded hiring and firing powers over teachers.

2/3/2022,"Achill is blowing through Chinese civil society as activists, journalists and academics report receiving police warnings and censorship of their social media platforms in recent weeks as Beijing prepares to host the Winter Olympics beginning on Friday. In mid-January, the Beijing-based human rights activist Hu Jia said in a tweet that China’s state security apparatus was summoning activists around the country to question them and warn them to stay silent.The author Zhang Yihe and prominent journalist Gao Yu said they had lost some or all of their access to WeChat, China’s dominant social media platform. Academics including Guo Yuhua, the outspoken Tsinghua University sociologist, and He Weifang, the Peking University law professor, reported similar issues.  Ahead of the Games, authorities also detained two prominent human rights activists: the lawyer Xie Yang and writer Yang Maodong. They are held on suspicion of “inciting state subversion”. A third rights lawyer, Tang Jitian, went missing in December en route to an EU human rights day event in Beijing. Such behaviour by China’s government may be a regular ritual for any big event, analysts and activists say, but the 2022 Winter Olympics will be the most tightly managed international event China has held in the last few years.“There’s nothing really unexpected about this,” said Wang Yaqiu, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch, who added that China’s Communist party was worried that online criticism by Chinese citizens could ruin “the facade of the perfect Games”.Although not unexpected, Beijing’s approach to this year’s Games is even stricter than when it hosted the Olympics in 2008, when Wang was a university student. “Back then we could criticise the Olympics; now nobody can say anything,” she said, adding that she had seen a noticeable uptick in Chinese citizens complaining about their social media posts disappearing. Hu agreed with Wang. “Right now, as far as sensitive terms inside China go, ‘Winter Olympics’ is second only to ‘Xi Jinping’,” Hu said. “No criticism by citizens is being permitted.” International criticism of the Games is the highest since the 2014 Winter Games, which were held in the Russian city of Sochi. Russia’s suppression of LGBT rights drew condemnation, and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) spoke up at the time.This year, the IOC has not had a critical word for Beijing. Its president, Thomas Bach, is accused by critics of helping China’s efforts to silence the tennis star Peng Shuai, who disappeared in November last year after accusing a top Communist official of sexual assault. Bach spoke to Peng via video link after a global outcry and the release of short videos purportedly of Peng going about daily life that appeared to be staged. Afterwards, he repeated her reassurances that she was fine, despite questions about her freedom that remain unanswered.“At least during Sochi the IOC spoke up for LGBT rights,” Wang said. “Now they’re part of the Chinese government’s propaganda machine.” Dick Pound, a senior IOC official, has described accusations that the organisation is aiding the Communist party’s propaganda efforts as “silly”.Hu, who was imprisoned for his activism during the 2008 Games, said he was disappointed by what he views as IOC complicity in Chinese human rights abuses and the Communist party’s legitimacy. That disappointment was amplified by the fact that a previous Olympics had helped push neighbouring South Korea from dictatorship to democracy. Seoul hosted the 1988 Games. “I was locked up for three-and-a-half years in 2008 – at that time I hoped the Olympic spirit of openness, equality and peace would drive the democratisation of China the way it did in South Korea in 1988,” Hu said. Instead, the legitimacy and prestige of the 2008 Beijing Games emboldened the Communist party, which has cracked down on dissent in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong since then.“The human rights abuses associated with the Beijing Winter Olympics are far worse than those connected to the Games 14 years ago,” Hu said.",News/World news,‘Nobody can say anything’: China cracks down on dissent ahead of Olympics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/nobody-can-say-anything-china-cracks-down-on-dissent-ahead-of-olympics
