5/4/2022,"A postcard-worthy scene of white sand beaches, azure waters and lush pine forests, Kassandra is one of the three so-called “legs” that branch off the Halkidiki peninsula in Greece. The other two are Sithonia, which is more mountainous and less developed, also blessed with forests and secluded beaches; and Athos, a male-only autonomous monastic state (although largely closed to visitors, you can view the splendour of its Byzantine monasteries from excursion boats that skirt its rocky shores). Arriving on Kassandra is an impressive experience. Effectively an island, it’s connected to Halkidiki by a bridge, which traverses the Potidea Canal, delivering you to a land of natural beauty. As you drive south, cultivated fields give way to verdant forests of towering Aleppo pines, which fill the air with the delightfully pungent aroma of pine resin when it rains. Amid Mediterranean maquis shrubland grow fragrant herbs such as mint, oregano and thyme. And then there’s the magnificent coast, where soft white sands fringe the turquoise sea, and rocky shores are speckled with samphire, rich in vitamins and antioxidants. Here, the Sani wetlands host more than 225 bird species, many rare and protected, so be on the lookout for purple herons, black storks and greater spotted eagles. The coast is a mixture of rocky shores and sandy beaches According to mythology, Halkidiki’s rugged topography was created when the giants who lived on Kassandra went into battle with the gods, who lived on Mount Olympus – which looms on the opposite side of the deep blue Gulf of Thermai and is visible from Kassandra’s west coast. Kassandra, with its beaches and wetlands, is connected to the mainland by a bridge over the Potidea Canal Kassandra’s fertile soils and abundant fishing waters attracted early settlers, especially on the east coast. Behind the beach in Kallithea stands the Sanctuary of Zeus Ammon, dating from the fourth century BC and the oldest place of worship on the peninsula. Later, in the first century AD, St Paul visited Kassandra as a missionary, and in Nea Fokea, you can see the small cave where he lived, accessed through a narrow tunnel inside a church. Then there’s Afitos, Kassandra’s loveliest village. Here, 19th-century stone mansions rim a cobbled main square with a local folklore museum, while a cliffside promenade affords stunning views down on to the Toroneos Gulf. Nea Fokea In the fertile interior, you’ll find small family-run organic wineries, open for tastings, and small stores specialising in extra-virgin olive oil and olive-oil-based cosmetics. Hiking paths traverse pastoral landscapes, with some leading to stunning beaches, such as Possidi Cape, a sandspit on the west coast, which changes shape depending on the sea currents. Above Possidi, hidden in pine forests, stands an enchanting amphitheatre. Each summer it hosts the Kassandra festival – past performers include Joan Baez, Cesária Evora, Goran Bregović and Mikis Theodorakis. The coastline is dotted with stunning beaches, while inland olive groves supply local producers The terrain becomes wilder as you head south, towards the tip of the peninsula. Here, Agia Paraskevi is known for beekeeping. Its honey, which can be infused with thyme, orange blossom, chestnut blossom and wild flowers from the surrounding mountains, is prized for its purity and intense flavour. Each summer on 25 July, the village hosts a honey festival. The gods of Olympus would be impressed, as would the great classical philosopher Aristotle, who was born in Halkidiki in the fourth century BC and was known to have praised honey for promoting longevity. Nearby, Loutra is home to a modern spa built over sulphurous thermal springs that emerge from underground caves at 39C. Said to relieve various ailments, they are yet another example of the extraordinary life force, bestowed by nature, that Kassandra embodies. Sani Resort, close to Bousoulas beach, offers carbon-neutral luxury Stay at ‘the world’s leading luxury green resort’If you decide to visit Kassandra, your ideal base is Sani Resort on the west coast, about an hour’s drive from Thessaloniki airport. Set in a 405-hectare ecological reserve of pine forests, criss-crossed by hiking paths, cycling trails, and wetlands populated by rare birds, alongside more than four miles of Blue Flag beaches, it was named the world’s leading luxury green resort at the 2021 World Travel Awards. Having become Greece’s first carbon neutral resort in 2020, every aspect of Sani’s vast offering is underpinned by the consciousness of its environmental impact. Running on 100% renewable electricity since 2019, the resort has also been investing in carbon efficiency upgrades with the view to retrofitting all of its properties as part of a larger four-year project, which will see significant investment in solar parks within the Sani area. And in terms of its food sustainability credentials, the resort prides itself on sourcing more than 60% of its fruit and vegetables from local growers. Centring on a 215-berth yachting marina, Sani encompasses five separate five-star hotels, each with its own distinctive identity: Sani Beach, Sani Club, Sani Dunes, Sani Asterias, and Porto Sani. Between them, they offer a wide range of activities, from tennis at the world-class Rafa Nadal Tennis Centre, scuba diving, sea kayaking and cycling, to sailing excursions, tours through the resort’s olive groves, and birdwatching in the Sani wetlands with expert eco-guides. And for those who really want to learn more about living in nature, there’s the Bear Grylls Survival Academy. Activities include cycling, tennis at the Rafa Nadal Tennis Centre and sea kayaking If you’re visiting in July or August, Sani hosts its own internationally renowned festival, this year celebrating its 30th anniversary. Primarily a jazz event in its early years, the programme has expanded to include classical, contemporary Greek, and modern dance and performance – all taking place against the dramatic backdrop of a ruined Byzantine tower and the views of the Aegean afforded from Sani hill. In terms of dining, the resort’s 40 restaurants and bars span from traditional Greek seafood at Alexis taverna to Spanish fare at El Puerto, sushi and sashimi at Katsu, modern Peruvian at Lima, and Thai fusion at Asian. And on top of that vast array of gastronomic options, Sani has no fewer than five spas offering restorative natural treatments when you’re ready for some pampering – a reminder that the earthly pleasures available to us on a trip to this culturally and ecologically astounding corner of Greece are enough to be the envy of the gods.

5/4/2022,"The drive from the airport to Costa Navarino truly whets your appetite for the feast to come. As you sweep up and down valleys, whizz past forests of olive trees and snake through sleepy villages from Kalamata, your anticipation builds for the destination, which is surrounded by some of Greece’s most strikingly untouched beauty. The Peloponnese is a sizeable peninsula at the southern tip of the country’s mainland – and in its south-west lies Messinia. It is not the best-known Greek destination, but more fool anyone who misses out on this region of stunning beaches, azure waters and ancient sites. Pylos harbour at sunset The shimmering jewel in Messinia’s crown is Voidokilia beach. The still, turquoise sea is so pretty it deserves a hug – and it gets one, embraced warmly by a semi-circle of sand dunes that form the shape of the Greek letter omega. This serene beach is thought to be the “sandy Pylos” referred to in Homer’s epic, The Odyssey. Around it, more beauty and history. The ruins of the Nestor’s Palace are nearby, while 30 minutes away are the Polylimnio waterfalls, a secret paradise of aqua waters set to a hypnotic, natural soundtrack. Voidokilia beach Farther out, ancient Messene is an hour-odd excursion. The city dates back as far as the bronze age, but the current site was built in 369BC and has been untouched by later settlements, its huge fortifications among the best preserved in Greece. Its most stunning feature is a vast ancient theatre, said to have held up to 10,000 spectators. Flanked faithfully by the Arcadian mountains on one side and the Ionian Sea on the other, it is a visceral and mesmerising site. If you’ve got a bit more stamina, the breathtaking landscape of Messinia is prime for hiking. Joining a specially curated tour allows you to really connect with this unspoiled corner of the Peloponnese, with some tailored to specific themes: local herbs, wines or castles. There are also fun biking and rock-climbing opportunities, or philosophy-flavoured ambles for a gentler, more cerebral afternoon. (Clockwise from top left) The ruins of King Nestor’s palace; the Tholos tomb nearby; the Polylimnio waterfalls After all that activity, your feet and your soul will long for somewhere beautiful to retreat to for pampering. Take them straight to Navarino Dunes, a spectacular 130-hectare estate nestled on the Ionian Sea coastline, and one of five distinct areas of Costa Navarino. Home to a pair of luxury resorts – The Westin Resort Costa Navarino and The Romanos, a Luxury Collection Resort – both of which were designed to reflect traditional Messinian style, with natural stone and marble. Buildings take up only 10% of the total area of the site – so it is amply spacious and criss-crossed with herb-lined walking paths. The Venetian fortress at Methoni Costa Navarino’s founder, the shipping magnate Vassilis Constantakopoulos, aimed to preserve the area’s natural abundance, building with local materials, and even planting a special type of grass for its on-site golf course, which requires 30% less water. At night, the resort uses low-intensity lights to make sure the beach is left dark in the evening, so baby turtles can find their way to the sea. Both The Westin and The Romanos offer a range of accommodation options, varying from deluxe rooms with garden or sea views, through to grand suites with their own infinity pools, while a handful of luxe beachfront villas at The Romanos offer direct access to a mile-long sandy beach – glorious at any time of day but approaching heavenly at sunrise. Keep your eyes peeled for sea turtles that lay their eggs on the sandy shores of the resort’s Dunes beach. Scuba diving off the Peloponnese Between them, the two resorts offer more than 20 restaurants and bars, ranging from fine dining to casual and family-friendly. There is a strong emphasis on providing the best contemporary Greek cuisine at venues such as Flame, Armyra and Perovino, but you’ll also find Japanese at Onuki, Italian at Da Luigi and the flavours of the Middle East at Nargile. There are also a number of private dining options such as the farm to table experience, family gatherings around the barbecue pits or intimate dinners for couples. On-site activities include pampering at the multi-award winning Anazoe Spa, which offers, among other things, thalassotherapy and signature treatments based on the health and beauty practices of ancient Greece. There is also swimming at the many outdoor pools, along with 16 tennis courts at the Mouratoglou Tennis Center (the first of its kind in Europe), health clubs with pilates and yoga classes, a variety of watersports and a diving centre – not to mention the 18-hole signature golf course on-site, as well as another three courses within an eight-mile radius of the resort. Costa Navarino has more than 20 restaurants and bars, a spa and countless sporting activities With a range of authentic gourmet experiences on offer, those looking to immerse themselves in Greek culture and cuisine won’t be disappointed either. Highlights include a wine tasting masterclass, cheesemaking courses, and the chance to prepare a delicious, traditional Messinian village lunch using regional techniques and fresh ingredients. All of which creates a very luxurious foil indeed to the days out exploring the area’s rich assortment of Mycenaean palaces, classical temples, Byzantine churches and medieval castles – switching between upscale contemporary living and 4,500 years of history and a palpable cultural heritage.

5/4/2022,"In the United States, there have been hundreds of treaties made with Native peoples and not one – not a single one – has ever been upheld. Reservations were created, and it was said: “This land will be yours for time immemorial”, but then it always shrinks and shrinks. In 2016, there was a massive protest against the Dakota Access pipeline. The original plan was for this pipeline to run from the oil fields up in the north-west corner of North Dakota through Bismarck, the wealthy state capital, and then down to wherever it was going. But someone in Bismarck said, “That won’t do. That’s dangerous,” because they knew it’s not a question of if, but when a pipeline will leak. So the course of the pipeline was changed to go through Standing Rock reservation and across the Missouri river. Standing Rock belongs to the Hunkpapa Lakota tribe, or Sioux. This is the land of Sitting Bull’s people, and the Missouri river gives clean drinking water to more than 80 million people in the US. One woman, LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, put out a call on social media, saying: “Please come and stand with us to protect the water.” I don’t think she had any idea how big it would become. At one point, there were over 30,000 people. They came from Africa, the Maori came from New Zealand, the indigenous Japanese came from Hokkaido, and there were Sami people and Tibetan monks. People came from all over the world to say: “Enough is enough.” They came to protect nature and water and indigenous people’s rights, and to protest that another treaty was not being upheld. It was about not poisoning our water. The protest was also about trying to physically keep work from being done on the pipeline. When the protests began I was working on We Are Still Here, a series of photographs of Native Americans. I heard about Standing Rock and knew I had to go and record it. I knew it was a historic moment. My mother is part African American, descended from slaves, and my father is Shinnecock Montaukett, a small whaling tribe from the tip of Long Island. I didn’t participate in the actual protests but I was documenting what was happening. I thought it was important, as an indigenous person, to have the opportunity to tell the story through an indigenous lens. I had to leave in late October, when this photo was taken, but the protests went on right through the winter. This particular image was the last I made there. The six weeks I was there I had been seeing Dan everywhere. I kept saying, “I really want to make a portrait of you,” but there was never an opportunity. The day I was leaving, I saw him on the road and said: “I have to leave. But let me make this photo.” That’s what I got. Dan Nanamkin is from the Colville Confederated Tribes of Washington State. Every day, he’d show up in full regalia. He is one of the most prayerful, peaceful people. He sang all the time, and anywhere people needed help, he was there. I didn’t ask him to do anything for this photo. I literally had just seconds to make two frames of him, and this was one of them. His body language seems to be saying: “Why? Why?” This road we were standing on was the actual path Sacagawea led Lewis and Clarke along, on the expedition heading west back in the early 1800s on their mission to explore and map the newly acquired territory of Louisiana. The people of Standing Rock created a blockade on this road, on the other side of which was a massive force with batons, tear gas, rubber bullets and sonic cannons. This was all being used against peaceful people, in defence of oil. The black smoke is from someone burning tyres as part of the roadblock. This first protest was during Obama’s administration, and finally Obama said: “OK, no pipeline.” When Trump was elected, the first thing he did was sign an order for the pipeline to be completed. He ordered a much larger force of National Guard and law enforcement to dismantle the protest, and the pipeline went ahead. A lot of the protesters went to prison; many have endured incredible hardships. The tribe has all the while been fighting this pipeline in court, and now they’re just waiting and hoping for Biden to shut it down. The most recent update is that they found the pipeline was made unlawfully, because the company didn’t do the full environmental evaluations, so now what? That’s where they are. My job as a photographer is to show people something they’ve maybe never seen before, or show something in a new way, to create greater empathy and compassion and to expand people’s knowledge of our world. Overall, I feel that humans don’t deserve this planet. We don’t act like we deserve it. I know that there will be a future – I just don’t know if it will be a nice one. There’s a Oaxacan saying: “You crushed us into the ground, but you didn’t know we were seeds.” After Standing Rock, there’s no such thing as a pipeline that doesn’t have a protest. It was an amazing experience to document.  Camille Seaman’s books include The Big Cloud and Melting Away, published by Princeton Architectural Press.

5/4/2022,"Afew years ago, I spent several months visiting the Palace of Westminster, where 56 MPs are now reportedly accused of sexual misconduct and one has admitted watching porn on his phone. It was eye-opening. I explored its roofscapes and back offices; I stood in the secret domed space above the central lobby; I picked my way through the labyrinth of tunnels below the high-tide level of the Thames, seeing its tangles of ageing pipework, its electrical cables and its groaning Victorian sewage tanks. Not least because of its tight security, the palace feels like a place unto itself: a tiny city-state cut off from the world outside. Aside from MPs and Lords, there are 6,000 passholders: caterers, clerks, contractors, political correspondents, administrators, cleaners. It (notoriously) has its own bars; it has its own hairdresser and nursery. It even had a firing range, in which, until 2015, members could take shooting lessons from special branch officers. There are other workplaces that envelop workers in a sort of shadow of a real life – but even the office-playgrounds of US tech companies won’t serve you eclairs and stewed tea in a panelled dining room or make available boxes of snuff, such as are placed outside the debating chambers in the mother of parliaments. I admit that I found the place seductive: over the months of my visits, the weirdness of it, which had seemed so extreme at first, very slightly began to wear off. I could see how it would be possible to go native, to acclimatise oneself to this curious nation and its conventions – even to take pleasure in mastering them. But even if, like me, you are a hardcore lover of neo-gothic architecture with a soft spot for eccentric traditions, the palace is, in its current state, a highly unsuitable place in which to run a democracy. The place has 31 lifts, only one of which is fully wheelchair compliant. In the House of Commons, MPs outnumber actual seats by 223, meaning on a crowded day “you find yourself”, in the words of one female MP, “sitting on a male MP’s lap”. There’s a reason modern parliaments have actual chairs; there is a reason their design tends to be glassily transparent, open, airy – these are architectural metaphors for democratic functioning, but also ways of encouraging behaviour to match. Westminster, by contrast, is a sepulchral maze of heavy doors, dark corridors and artworks overwhelmingly of white men. In 2016, Professor Sarah Childs published the Good Parliament report. She told me then that “the building facilitates, valorises, and rewards certain kinds of behaviours and performances that are disproportionately practised by some men – and excludes others.” More than that, the building is dangerous. In 2,500 places in the estate, it is calculated, there is asbestos. According to David Goldstone, who has the thankless task of running the “restoration and renewal” programme of the palace, it would take two and a half to three years, and 300 workers, to fix that problem alone. A leak from a Victorian steam pipe could send that asbestos hurtling through the ventilation system, to be inhaled by thousands of workers. Fire is a serious and present peril. Between 2008 and 2012 the building caught fire 40 times; fire patrol officers walk the buildings 24 hours a day. Since the Houses of Parliament were rebuilt after a catastrophic conflagration on the night of 16 October, 1834, there has been no full overhaul of the building. Systems (for electricity, gas, telephones, security) have been quickly laid over each other, choking the ducts and clogging the basement tunnels. Every day that passes, the likelihood of some disaster increases – and if you are inclined to be hardhearted about the possible fate of MPs, at least consider the blameless cleaners and cooks. This is all fixable: at a price. If only it wasn’t the job of parliamentarians themselves to do it, then perhaps some progress would have been made. In 2015, it was estimated that to renovate the Houses of Parliament – which, if you were ambitious, could not only sort out the actual daily risk to life but also make it a better, more equal building for those who work in it – would cost upwards of £3.5bn. You can see why parliamentarians would hesitate to vote “themselves” so much cash, even though it has nothing to do with them personally, and would be about securing the safe running of parliament in the future. That sum, however, now looks like a bargain: with every day of inaction, costs rise. This year the sponsor body – the board overseeing “restoration and renewal”, established in 2019 by act of parliament – estimated that it would cost a minimum of £7bn just to make the palace safe, assuming it were vacated for at least 12 years. But such is the pull of the palace, so seductive its ridiculous traditions, that a rump of parliamentarians will, in grotesque defiance of common sense, seemingly do anything rather than leave it. Told by the sponsor body that staying in the Commons chamber could potentially mean costs rising to £22bn and taking 76 years, the commissions of the Commons and the Lords reacted by deciding to abolish the sponsor body itself, which looks a lot like shooting the messenger. Procrastination and delay rule. The reports, meetings, reviews, minutes, and repetitive questions pile up: Jarndyce & Jarndyce has nothing on this. The metaphors that this situation suggest are too obvious to press; you can think of them yourself. But I’m reminded that in the 1850s, Augustus Pugin, who worked with Charles Barry to design the new Palace of Westminster after the 1834 fire, became mentally ill – as in, was actually admitted to Bethlem Hospital, dying shortly after his five-week sojourn there – by the demands of trying to work for parliamentarians. It is not hard to see why.

5/4/2022,"Rupert Murdoch’s talkTV television channel has been rated as having “zero viewers” during primetime broadcasts, as the new television channel struggles to attract an audience despite signing up Piers Morgan as a presenter. The News Desk, the channel’s hour-long political show hosted by Tom Newton Dunn, did not register a single viewer for half of its Tuesday evening broadcast. Although this does not rule out the possibility that some people were watching somewhere in the UK, it means the television audience was so small that it was not be picked up by official rating agency, the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board. The audience for Morgan’s flagship 8pm evening show also collapsed from an average of 317,000 viewers on its launch night to 62,000 viewers a week later – a fall of 80%. Morgan, who tweeted gleefully about his first night television ratings, now insists he does not care about such figures. He told his social media followers that television ratings should be ignored: “Linear TV increasingly irrelevant to total eyeball potential for a global show like this, especially with younger viewers who don’t really watch TV any more.” News UK has claimed that clips from Morgan’s show attracted 64m views on social media platforms and news websites during its first week on air when he had an interview with the former US president Donald Trump. However, the methodology behind this claim is unclear and recent episodes of the show on Morgan’s YouTube channel are attracting about 10,000 viewers. Trump himself has now weighed in on talkTV’s performance: “Ratings for the Piers Morgan interview with me were great! Unfortunately, after that interview, his show bombed completely because of the fake narrative he tried to portray. The fact is, I got a new closeup glimpse at Piers, and he no longer has what it takes. It’s over for him!” Despite an enormous advertising campaign, talkTV is being consistently beaten in the ratings by fellow upstart television channel GB News. That channel was also initially mocked for its pitifully low viewing figures before gradually rebuilding its audience by promoting Nigel Farage and full-blooded culture war discussion. The talkTV ratings are a challenge for the News UK chief executive, Rebekah Brooks, who is need of a hit after sinking tens of millions of pounds into the project. She had publicly dismissed the business case for a new broadcast television news channel as “not commercially viable” before reversing course after Murdoch signed up Morgan on a reported £50m three-year deal. The audience for The Talk – talkTV’s nightly discussion programme hosted by Sharon Osbourne – has also dipped as low as 10,000 viewers. Osbourne only hosted three nights of the programme before announcing she was flying home to Los Angeles to be with her ill husband, Ozzy. She has since appeared on her own show via video link, with Jeremy Kyle drafted in to help with presenting duties. On Wednesday, Morgan said his nightly programme was still performing well in the ratings when compared with other news channels: “Amazing achievement for a brand new show on a brand new network. Lots of work to do, but very encouraging.”",News/Media,Piers Morgan ratings dive as talkTV struggles to attract viewers,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/04/piers-morgan-ratings-dive-as-talktv-struggles-to-attract-viewers
5/4/2022,"Concerned about sweeping Russia-style sanctions from the west, Beijing has ordered a comprehensive “stress test” to study the implications of a similar scenario for its economy, the Guardian has learned. According to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, an extensive exercise began around late February and early March when western allies imposed unprecedented sanctions against Moscow. Several key Chinese government agencies – from banking regulation to international trade – have been asked to come up with responses if the west imposed the same embargos on to China. “Those involved in this exercise use how Russia was treated as a baseline for China’s own policy response should it be treated in a same fashion by the west,” the person added. “This stress test involves a range of methodology, including modelling.” Beijing did not specify why it had asked its vast bureaucracy to carry out such an exercise, the person said. They said that it was a “natural reaction” from Beijing given its close relationship with Moscow. A second source, who wishes to remain anonymous, said that Chinese diplomats had in the past few weeks also been meeting experts to understand the trajectory of this conflict. “From Beijing’s perspective, if the US-led western allies could take such measures against Moscow, they could also do the same to China. Therefore, it needs to know how resilient the country really is,” said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace based in Beijing. But Edward Fishman, a former adviser to John Kerry on economic sanctions at the US state department, said that no economy – not even China – was immune to the types of financial sanctions that the west has wielded against Russia. “There is no good alternative to the western financial system, and that’s likely to remain the case for a long time,” he said. “The future of economic conflict between the west and China, therefore, will likely be narrower in scope than what we’ve seen from the west in recent months against Russia. It will centre on jockeying for leverage in strategic areas – such as frontier technologies and next-generation infrastructure – not on trying to produce broad-based economic disruption.” Zhao said that the current exercise by Beijing could be an attempt to understand what the short-term cost to China would be if it provided material support to Russia over the course of this conflict. US officials this week said they had not yet seen military and economic support for Russia from China, despite earlier warnings of the possibility. On 22 April, Officials from China’s finance ministry and the central bank held a meeting with domestic and foreign banks, including HSBC, to discuss how they could protect China’s overseas assets should Russia-style sanctions led by the US and its western allies also be imposed, according to a recent report by the Financial Times. Chinese analysts were caught off-guard by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, several personnel said. But the western response, according to Zhao, was “more surprising to the Beijing leadership initially”. “For the past few years, there’s been a growing concern among Beijing’s leadership that a strategic conflict between China and the west may not be a question of whether it’d happen, but when it will happen, in particular over the issue of Taiwan.” Beijing has strongly opposed any link to Taiwan when discussing the war in Ukraine, insisting they are two separate matters. Last week, the Chinese embassy in London again criticised British media’s comparison of the two, saying the Taiwan issue “bears on China’s core interests and we will brook no external interference”. The information office of China’s state council has been contacted by the Guardian for comments. China’s foreign ministry in the past week stepped up its rhetorical support for Russia, saying that the two sides “rise above the model of military and political alliance in the cold war era”, and that the two countries “commit themselves to developing a new model of international relations”. Curiously, around the same time, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told the official Xinhua news agency that Kyiv was keen to involve Beijing in ensuring its security. “We propose that China becomes one of the guarantors of Ukraine’s security, this is a sign of our respect and trust in the People’s Republic of China,” he said on Saturday. In 2013, China agreed to provide Ukraine with “security guarantees” if it is invaded or threatened with nuclear attack. But critics say Beijing remained evasive on the same issue after Russia’s invasion in February.

Was it really worth £5m? Maybe. And why did Corré torch all this stuff? Was it a protest against the way the punk spirit has been sold out to corporate culture? Or was it Corré’s cry of psychological pain at being cut out of his father’s will, as the film comes close to hinting? Again: maybe. The other question is, who cares? Eventually the burning was sold to the public as a kind of climate-emergency protest. That is something we can get all get behind, but young people today will understandably be impatient or indifferent about the necrophiliac issue of whether or not “punk” should “wake up”. The film is on much stronger ground when it gets on to the more interesting question of who are the heirs to punk. Corré and Westwood both think that Julian Assange is a true punk; and whatever you think about Assange, yes, there is something in that. (Punk was also an artistic movement, so maybe the punk heirs are Damien Hirst and the YBA radicals, who are themselves a thing of the past.) But the more valuable post-punks or neo-punks are the climate activists, especially the school-strikers, whose witty, impassioned banners have a punk spirit, although without the nihilism. Yet the focus of the film isn’t really on them, and it has a series of very tiring (and very McLaren-esque) satirical interludes showing stage-school Dickensian urchins telling each other how all the money in the world is controlled by a small number of people. Hmmm. The film didn’t mention the fact that Corré founded the hugely lucrative Agent Provocateur lingerie chain, which was sold in 2007 to a private equity house. Still, it was good to see the late Jordan (AKA Pamela Rooke), the iconic punk model who cheerfully said Corré could set fire to his own stuff if he wanted, and also that authentically eccentric and English figure Edward Tudor-Pole.

5/4/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email. There’s been an interesting development in the games business this week: Square Enix, the Japanese company behind Final Fantasy, has sold off basically its entire North American business for $300m. Swedish entrepreneur collective Embracer Group, a relative newcomer in gaming, is now the proud owner of studios in Montreal the US, and properties like Deus Ex, Thief and, of course, Tomb Raider. Not too long ago, this would have felt like big news purely because of the money involved. But given the eyebrow-raising sums that have been flying around in the games industry lately – Sony paid $3.5bn for Bungie, a studio that currently has only one game (Destiny), and of course Microsoft is set to pay nearly $70bn for Activision-Blizzard and its suite of games – $300m seems quite the bargain. You’d think Tomb Raider alone might at one point have been worth that much or more. But not any more. Tomb Raider is a game series that’s never really been what it should have been, if you ask me. In the 1990s the series broke through because its star, Lara Croft, became a polygonal sex symbol, gracing the pages of lads’ mags and the cover of The Face. But I’ve always felt that Tomb Raider’s popularity is despite, rather than because of, the overt and deeply embarrassing sexualisation of Lara Croft. A lot of women and girls – hi! – loved Lara Croft because she was a badass action hero, and in the absolute diversity desert of late 1990s and early 00s pop culture, she was pretty much all we had (her, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer); it’s not like we had a bunch of non-sexualised female characters to choose from instead. The games, meanwhile – the best of them – were actually kinda quiet and cerebral (and frustrating, to be honest). Lara had two pistols, but she rarely used them. Mostly she was alone in tombs, trying to disarm ancient booby-traps and make tricky leaps of faith. I believe that only a few of the various people who have been in charge of Tomb Raider and Lara Croft over the years – from movie-makers to developers – have actually understood why it is that people love it. Scriptwriters make Lara Croft one-dimensional, a posh heroine with a suite of one-liners and impractically skimpy clothing, when actually she’s kind of a big nerd at heart; she loves archaeology and ancient civilisations, she pores over artefacts, she’s bright and aristocratic, self-sufficient and tough and brave. 2013’s Tomb Raider reboot attempted to humanise Lara Croft by turning her into a young shipwrecked survivor on a dangerous island where horrible things kept happening to her and her friends; it was good to play a Tomb Raider game in which Lara Croft actually felt like a person and had human relationships, but at times that game veered too close to the old trope of making female characters ‘relatable’ by making them vulnerable. The Croft we played in the 2015 sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider, was more self-assured and capable, following a character arc that would have been quite satisfying if 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider hadn’t absolutely fluffed it with a tonally disastrous pivot to Lara Croft as indiscriminate murderer of bad guys. And what all these games did was turn Tomb Raider into a bit of a shooting gallery, an Uncharted-esque series of explosions and choke-holds and huge set-piece moments, all zip-lining towards a burning oil rig while aiming a rifle at mercenaries. I could take or leave all of that. What I loved – what I wanted – were the moments where Lara emerged from some narrow cavern and into an unbelievable vista, some waterfall with a tomb concealed beneath; an icy cave with an ancient wreck stuck improbably in the ice. I loved the (tellingly, optional) tombs, with their intricate puzzles and eureka moments. In these moments Lara Croft isn’t just good with a pistol – she’s clever, and daring, and curious. There’s a Tomb Raider Live Experience on in London at the moment, an hour-long escape room thing where you scramble under nets and crawl through dark passages and collect relics, following in Croft’s footsteps while actors pretend that you’re her students. I had a go last week and though it was vaguely entertaining in a Crystal Maze kind of way, it was honestly nothing to do with Tomb Raider. The loose plot made little sense; none of the set-dressing had anything to do with Lara or the games; when one of our team made a joke about skipping cut-scenes in front of one of the actors, they looked genuinely perplexed. There wasn’t even a freezer in Croft Manor, to the immense disappointment of anyone who wasted an hour of their youth trying to trap her butler inside it in Tomb Raider 2. It was ultimately a generic set of team-building exercises with a Tomb Raider label slapped on it, and it made me quite sad. Once again it appeared to have been built by people who didn’t really understand what’s cool and interesting about the Tomb Raider. A zipline can’t compensate for that. For me, Tomb Raider’s about exploring, really, about making discoveries and thinking laterally and pushing your limits. The recent games have had some of these moments, and I suspect that these were the parts of the games that the developers themselves loved most, rather than the more predictable action-movie stuff. Would people actually buy a more sedate Tomb Raider game, with less blowing stuff up and more actual raiding of tombs? The bosses at Square Enix clearly thought not, but I’m hoping that the series’ future custodians might be more optimistic. That, or we’ll end up with some dismal failed attempt at a live service multiplayer game like Fortnite. I know which I’d prefer. If you’ve ever longed for a cerebral and thought-provoking video-game interpretation of Blade Runner – quite a specific yearning, but still – then this week’s indie darling Citizen Sleeper is for you. You play a dying runaway android on a space station that’s falling apart. Most of what you learn about your surrounding, you read through text descriptions, occasionally embellished with detailed illustrations of places and characters, and with its dice roles and sedate pace it feels more like a board game than a video game at times. What elevates it is the atmosphere, conjured mostly from words.

5/4/2022,"In the 1920s and 1930s, boiling hot American jazz didn’t really suit the British reserve. So Britain created something of its own: the dance band, a regional variant whose seeds had been sown back in 1919 when the riotous Original Dixieland Jazz Band had arrived in London. They had played what sounded to British ears like banjo, clarinet, cornet and trombone all channelling different melodies at the same time. It had been confusing, but thrilling. Hundreds of budding musicians thought they could do what the Original Dixieland Jazz Band did; the cockier ones thought they could do it better. London’s Savoy hotel had introduced its first dance outfit by 1922, and the British bands soon took on a new, localised look; in dinner jackets, with hair slicked back, they would generally be made up of seven or eight players, plus a bandleader and occasional vocalist. The repertoire was based around jazz, only streamlined and anglicised, respectable and army-disciplined. This, it turned out, was exactly what Britain wanted, with double bass and Spanish guitar smoothly replacing the sousaphone and banjo. The interwar dance-band scene can be easy to dismiss, as historically it has almost always been seen through the lens of jazz. But importantly, these bands focused on something that remains essential to British pop: a good beat. There was a reason why they called themselves “dance bands”: a nation of factory workers who would later devote themselves to the metronomic rhythms of northern soul and Chicago house had heard the loose, improvised sounds of New Orleans and decided they would like something a little different. And dance bands were modern; they felt like the future – a sophisticated future. Ray Noble’s rhapsodic, gliding Midnight, the Stars and You was several worlds away from the Bovril and damp village halls evoked by Keep the Home Fires Burning. The West End in the 1930s was the hub of the dance band scene: Bert Ambrose at the May Fair; Jack Jackson at the Dorchester; Maurice Winnick at the San Marco; Harry Roy at the Café Anglais; and the imported Americans Carroll Gibbons at the Savoy and Roy Fox at the Monseigneur on Jermyn Street. The foxtrot had started off the craze. High-end restaurants and hotels cashed in, removing tables to create a dancefloor, and customers danced the night away. As much as Britain loved a good beat, it didn’t like a showoff. The scene’s musical exemplar would be band leader Spike Hughes. As well as being a bassist, Hughes was also a reviewer for Melody Maker who specialised in hot jazz, writing under the pseudonym “Mike”. When he decided to visit New York for a holiday in 1933, he was lucky enough to be met off the boat by John Hammond, a fellow Melody Maker writer and an industry man who would go on to sign Billie Holiday, Count Basie, Bob Dylan and Aretha Franklin. Hammond invited Hughes to stay at his Greenwich Village apartment for the week: they visited the Cotton Club (where Hughes felt so uncomfortable at the racial split between musicians and audience that he wrote it off as “a waste of time”); saw Bessie Smith (Empty Bed Blues, he wrote, was “not for the squeamish”); visited the music publisher Irving Mills’s office, just as Harold Arlen was presenting a new song called Stormy Weather; and attended Noël Coward’s farewell party at the end of Design for Living’s Broadway run. At Monette’s Supper Club, Billie Holiday sat at Spike’s table and sang to him. He even fitted in a wild affair with an English woman only known as Georgina. By now he was having such a good time that he decided to stay a bit longer. The only catch was that he needed to record some sides for Decca. He wired them: could he record in New York instead of London? The result was an ad hoc band called Spike Hughes and His Negro Orchestra, including Benny Carter, Coleman Hawkins and Chu Berry, which cut 14 sides arranged by Spike; Fanfare, Sweet Sorrow Blues and Donegal Cradle Song were his own compositions, to boot. These players could see around corners. The sound was a true amalgam of British dance band and New York jazz, and Spike Hughes was a respected colleague and artistic equal. What did Spike do with his newfound knowledge and crazily impressive address book? He never played the double bass again. “Anything that came later would have been an anticlimax,” he wrote in his memoir. “I left jazz behind me at the moment when I was enjoying it the most, the moment when all love affairs should end. To have returned to Europe and to have tried to take up jazz again where I had left it in New York would have been folly and an impossibility. When at the end of May 1933 I sailed to Southampton in the Aquitania, I carefully threw all Georgina’s letters to me into the Atlantic; figuratively I threw jazz into the ocean too.” Spike Hughes had got closer to the flame than any other British musician. Billie Holiday had sat at his table. And he backed away, slightly embarrassed. Still, he didn’t give up on music completely: throughout the 1960s and 70s he could be seen on television, presenting Southern Television’s annual coverage of the Glyndebourne festival. Britain’s musical taste in the 1930s was similarly shy and isolationist, but nevertheless reached for the exotic; it yearned for the foreign, struggling with the tension between its hatred of boiled cabbage and its fear of garlic. Sometimes an exotic name would be enough, just a whiff of foreign climes, nothing to scare the islanders. By the 1930s, searching for novelty, dance halls had begun to employ Hawaiian bands, gaucho tango bands and the successful Primo Scala and His Accordion Band, made up of four accordions, two pianos, violin, bass, guitar and drums. “Primo” turned out to be a Londoner called Harry Bidgood, the musical director on George Formby’s films. The most mysterious, most adventurous character to emerge from the whole dance band scene was the Mayfair-raised Reginald Foresythe. He originally came from a classical background, got into popular music as a way of making a living, was intrigued by Black American culture and ended up being feted by the biggest names in jazz. Even for a Briton, he had a particularly detached view, which resulted in a very singular, often melancholic sound; at first listen you might think he was influenced by Duke Ellington’s late-1940s albums or Raymond Scott’s odd arrangements, but Foresythe’s own blend of woodwind-heavy jazz and classical came 15-20 years ahead of schedule. Black, gay and British, in 1930s London he must have seemed like he’d been beamed down from Mars. Foresythe’s Nigerian father had died when he was a child, and he was raised by his Scottish mother on Curzon Street in Mayfair. A prodigious pianist by his teens, he swanned off to Italy, Australia and Hawaii. In Australia, he played with Harlem musical theatre tenor Walter Richardson, and the pair discovered they had similar politics. In August 1929 the Adelaide Advertiser wrote that Foresythe “hoped to roll away something of the cloud of racial prejudice against the negro by proving that negroes can not only be singers and entertainers, but gentlemen … ‘Culture is something more than skin deep,’ he asserted.” Arriving in California in 1930, he soon found work as a pianist with Paul Howard’s Quality Serenaders, a band that included Lionel Hampton (on drums and vocals) and trombonist Lawrence Brown, who would soon go east to play with Duke Ellington. Foresythe also played on myriad early talkies, including DW Griffith’s Abraham Lincoln, and toured the US southern states to get an insight into the living conditions of Black Americans and to hear some jazz and blues at close quarters. His odd, classically tinged, unshowy style quickly picked up a reputation. Most of 1931 was spent with Earl Hines’s band at Chicago’s Grand Terrace Café and Ballroom, arranging and orchestrating, leading rehearsals and even writing Hines’s signature tune, Deep Forest. Duke Ellington was so impressed he let Foresythe stay in his apartment as a semi-permanent house guest. Foresythe repaid him by drinking heavily and regularly getting into fights in gay clubs and bars. You might have already guessed, but this story doesn’t have a particularly happy ending. Having made his wildly impressive American connections, Reggie returned to London in 1933 to show Britain what he was capable of. Melody Maker, in a glowing introductory piece, called him a “wonderful musician”. Top dance band leader Bert Ambrose also considered Foresythe to be something very special, and chose him to be the in-house bandleader at Swallow Street’s new Café de la Paix, which was looking for something more progressive and exotic than the usual dance orchestra. This was where The New Music of Reginald Foresythe would be unveiled on 17 October 1933, the most forward-looking British sound of the decade. There was no brass, just reeds and a wind section, and the titles were as outré as the music: Lament for Congo, The Duke Insists, Volcanic (Eruption for Orchestra), Bit, Berceuse for an Unwanted Child and The Autocrat Before Breakfast. The press described it as “something quite distinctive in dance music”, but also as “difficult to dance to”, though the Café’s clientele didn’t seem to mind. Serenade for a Wealthy Widow and Angry Jungle were recorded for Columbia as an opening salvo, with eight more slices of “new music” recorded over the following year, including the eerie masterpiece Garden of Weed. Foresythe was quite aware of how good he was. In December 1933 he wrote a piece for Tune Times called “This New Music of Mine”, which read like a manifesto and revealed him to be a true modernist: “Symphonic jazz is quite tasteless to me, and I was very amused a short while ago when a well-known critic and composer said he thought I was really a Gershwin at heart. The essence of all art lies in the extremist simplicity of expression. This is my aim … the omission of the obvious … the suppression of the superfluous … the most expression with the greatest economy of means. It may be that I am on the wrong track … perhaps it will even prove to be a cul-de-sac … I do not think so.’ By 1935 it seemed everybody loved Reggie. Truly Anglo-American, his musical futurism was not only accepted, but could be turned into actual hits by Benny Goodman or Henry Hall or Earl Hines or Ambrose; even Louis Armstrong had recorded his He’s a Son of the South. He could say things like: “I believe music is a form of higher mathematics. That was how the Greeks dealt with music, and all their disciples. It was only during the 18th century that music began to be regarded as a romantic art.” No one feigned horror or called him out as pretentious. He was on his own, a visitor from the future, a creator of “third stream” jazz who was so talented and confident he could tell Duke Ellington where he should be taking his music. So why isn’t Reginald Foresythe’s name better known? It would be easy to say it’s because he was Black and gay when neither was readily accepted by the establishment, but that hardly seems to have held him back. How did his crown slip so suddenly? That’s a little easier to explain. In January 1935 another high-profile admirer, John Hammond, set up a recording session for Foresythe in New York with no less than Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa on four of his own compositions: The Melancholy Clown, Lullaby, The Greener the Grass and Dodging a Divorcee. The sides, released under the name Reginald Foresythe and his New Music, were terrific but sold poorly. Within 18 months, the session seemed like an odd portent. Goodman had become a star in the meantime, and swing – a more basic, much louder form of the new music – was king. Foresythe’s tone poems, his dislike of soloing and his carefully put-together woodwind lineup seemed fussy and fusty overnight. He had played the part of Joe Meek to Benny Goodman’s Beatles. And then came the war. Foresythe joined the RAF and emerged with distinction, but by 1945 he had been diagnosed with “war nerves”, or what we would now call PTSD. A decade on from his heyday, his confidence shot, Foresythe became a full-blown alcoholic and spent the late 1940s and 50s playing clubs in Britain, where his name had been forgotten. He died in 1958, by which time the “third stream” music he had pioneered in the early 30s was just achieving a commercial breakthrough. So much for the musicians. The public, too, had some very fixed ideas about how dance bands should behave. “The central tradition of British mass dancing,” wrote Eric Hobsbawm, “moved away from jazz towards a curious phenomenon called ‘strict tempo’ dancing, which was to become a competitive sport on British television.” No improv, nothing left to chance – plenty of people in Britain wanted their popular music rigidly ordered, with a rulebook and marks out of 10. A good beat and a good tune. That, for Britain in the 1930s, was enough.  Bob Stanley’s Let’s Do It: The Birth of Pop is published by Faber & Faber on 5 May (£25).

5/4/2022,"At least no fridges were involved. On Tuesday, it had been Boris Johnson who got the Good Morning Britain treatment. A tough, no-bullshit interview with Susanna Reid that had found The Convict shorter than usual on convincing answers. On Wednesday, it was Keir Starmer’s turn. And if the leader of the opposition had hoped he would be in for an easier ride, he was in for a big disappointment. There were to be no concessions for being trustworthy and not having spent the past five years trying to avoid the programme. Come the end, he too was begging for the exit. Albeit with rather more dignity intact than Johnson. Small consolation. The Convict’s interview had taken place inside No 10. Starmer’s was in the ITV studios, and this time Richard Madeley was allowed to join in the fun. Though he struggled to get a word in edgeways. Not something you can often say. The Labour leader looked tense, nervous and miserable from the off. As if the next 20 minutes were a punishment beating that he couldn’t avoid, rather than an opportunity to sell his party’s policies and pick up any stray votes before Thursday’s local elections. Reid wasted no time on niceties, going straight in on Labour’s plans for a windfall tax on energy companies. Here Starmer had a decent story to tell. He was only looking to tax excess profits, and even the BP chief exec had said a windfall tax wouldn’t stop his company investing in cheaper green energy. Yet even now Starmer managed to sound defensive. As if he was expecting some kind of comeback. None came, as Reid looked satisfied enough with his answers and moved on to the national insurance rise. Would Labour keep it if it won the next general election? Starmer wasn’t at all clear, other than that he definitely wouldn’t have introduced it in the first place. But he couldn’t be any more precise than that as it was impossible to know in what the Tories would leave the economy. On current form the choices appear to be disastrous or completely catastrophic. Yet Keir wouldn’t be drawn. He might keep the tax he wouldn’t have brought in, but there again he might not. And the best explanation he could offer for how he would replace the £12bn to be spent on the NHS was recouping the money lost in fraud during the Covid pandemic. He didn’t make it sound like the most convincing of plans. After Madeley briefly brought up the total non-story of Oliver Dowden’s claims of an electoral pact between Labour and the Lib Dems, Reid moved on to Beergate. What exactly had gone on in Durham when Starmer was photographed through a window having a beer and a £200 takeaway curry that had been bought for 20 to 30 of his aides? Yes, chipped in Madeley, holding up the front page of the Daily Mail which for the seventh day in a row had led with the story, what had been going on? Anyone might think that Lord Rothermere, the Daily Mail’s non-dom owner, was pissed off that Labour had promised to abolish non-dom status. At least this time the Labour leader was able to categorically deny that the Durham police had questioned him recently about the incident. The previous day he had – for reasons best known to himself – three times refused to answer the question. Something we normally expect of Johnson. And yet he managed to do so while still somehow looking and sounding uncomfortable. Borderline shifty. Releasing fragments of information under duress rather than just shooting down the whole story as a desperate attempt to undermine Labour’s integrity. As a sign that he was doing something right and that the Tory establishment was worried. For the whole thing is so obviously bollocks. It was just Starmer and some aides having something to eat after a day’s campaigning. Which was perfectly within the rules, as Durham constabulary had already concluded. It wasn’t a party like the leaving dos or Boris and Party Marty’s free-for-all in the Downing Street garden where staffers and empties had to be removed from the flower beds. And it wasn’t as if anything had been planned. No one had come in to the office with the curry, singing “Happy five days until the Hartlepool byelection to you”. Hell, what kind of party only remembers to serve food at 10pm? And only serves one bottle of beer? What was needed was for Starmer to own the situation. To own the curry. To own the interview. To own the room. To be candid and yet rightfully dismissive of attempts by the Mail – aided and abetted by The Convict’s very own mouthpiece, the Sun – to stigmatise every politician as equally venal. As bad as each other. Reducing everyone to his own level is straight out of the Johnson playbook. As it was, Starmer was left diminished, with the Johnson shills triumphant at his imagined guilt. None more so than the ever absurd Nadine Dorries, who is incapable of distinguishing between truth and lies. Though the public appear to be, as the Mail’s campaign has had little effect with voters still quick to finger The Convict as the real wrong’un. So maybe the Labour leader’s discomfort was just a transient misstep. Certainly that seemed to be the Tory party’s take. Why else would you send out an idiot like George Eustice to grab the headlines with a reminder to people not to shop at Waitrose. Let them eat Lidl cake. How to beat the cost of living crisis in one easy fix. Seldom has a government seemed so out of touch. Time for Starmer to stop apologising for himself. It’s the Conservatives who should be saying sorry.",News/Politics,Defensive Starmer chokes at chance to own the curry | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/04/keir-starmer-gmb-interview-beergate-sketch
