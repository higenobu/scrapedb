3/13/2022,"Nuclear talks in Vienna between Iran and the world powers were officially ""paused"" on Friday, with no clear timetable for renewing them, according to the European Union's top diplomat. Why it matters: Although a draft agreement is practically ready, Russia's new demands that sanctions imposed over Ukraine won't limit Moscow's ability to conduct trade with Iran have dramatically complicated the situation.

The latest: Russian chief negotiator Mikhail Ulyanov told reporters in Vienna the pause on the talks has nothing to do with Russia. He claimed it's due to remaining gaps between some of the parties in the talks, denying Russia has caused an impasse. ""The conclusion of the deal does not depend only on Russia. There are other actors who need additional time and have additional concerns,"" Ulyanov said. What they're saying: ""A pause in Vienna talks is needed, due to external factors. A final text is essentially ready and on the table,"" tweeted EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who is the coordinator of the talks. Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh tweeted: ""Pause in Vienna Talks could be a momentum for resolving any remaining issue and a final return."" ""Successful conclusion of talks will be the main focus of all. No external factor will affect our joint will to go forward for a collective agreement."" U.S. envoy Rob Malley arrived back in Washington on Friday from Vienna, State Department spokesman Ned Price said. Price said decisions need to be made “in Tehran and Moscow” but if there is political will it will be possible to return to the nuclear deal. “The new Russian related sanctions shouldn’t have any influence on the implementation of the Iran deal. We won’t offer Russia anything new or specific on this,” Price said. What's next: Borrell said he will continue to be in touch with Iran, the U.S. and the world powers participating in the talks to overcome the current situation and close the agreement.

3/13/2022,"Ukraine released drone footage of an ambush on a Russian armored convoy near Kyiv Thursday. At least 21 Russian military vehicles, including a thermobaric weapon, were caught in the attack. The ambush forced a humiliating retreat, according to a Sky News analysis of the footage. Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency released a video on Thursday showing the destruction and retreat of a Russian column of tanks near Kyiv, in footage verified by several news agencies. Ukraine claimed that the Russian regiment's commander, Colonel Andrei Zakharov, was killed in the operation, though this has not been independently confirmed. The 45-second edited montage of footage was filmed by drone and, according to the DIA, shows Russian tank movements in the suburb of Skybyn, around 20 miles from central Kyiv. In the footage, two tanks — of indeterminate nationality — are seen approaching Skybyn, according to a Sky News analysis. The investigative collective Bellingcat also confirmed the location. About 1,200 people have died in the port city of Mariupol, Ukraine, after intense shelling by Russia. Now, locals are burying the dead in a mass grave. Further shots show Russian tanks on the side of the road, per Sky News. They are later seen on fire. This is intercut with footage of a long column of tanks heading south into the village. Among them is a vehicle Sky identified as a TOS-1A thermobaric rocket launcher. In another shot, at least 21 Russian military vehicles, including tanks, armored personnel carriers and the TOS-1A, are seen in the village. Tread marks on the road indicate they have changed direction. Two plumes of smoke and fire then mark Ukrainian strikes at either end of the column: The TOS-1A then appears to fire at a target out of frame. Russia admitted using its controversial thermobaric weapons on Wednesday, the BBC reported the UK's Ministry of Defence as saying. The video then shows everal other Russian vehicles being hit. Whilst still under fire the convoy is seen moving back north. The footage is overlaid with audio said to be of a Russian officer reporting the attack, The Guardian reported. ""Sixth regiment lost,"" the officer says, per The Guardian. ""I cannot report about the 6th regiment. I'm collecting data. Lots of losses. They waited for us. Head of the convoy got into the ambush. Regiment commander killed in action."" Military experts speaking to the paper described the video as credible. Ukraine has published a series of such videos as part of a public relations effort to keep international and local attention on apparent military successes against Russia. The overall military picture remains bleak for Ukraine, however. In briefings on Tuesday and Wednesday, a Pentagon official said that about 90 to 95% of Russian combat power remains intact, despite the widely-viewed examples of Ukrainian defense. Authorities released similar aerial footage of strikes on military vehicles dated March 8, which was confirmed by Insider as being shot outside of the village of Borodyanka, on a key road to Kyiv. A US official estimated Wednesday that Russian forces have sustained 5-6,000 losses since the war began, per CBS News.
