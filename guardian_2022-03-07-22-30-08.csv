3/7/2022,"A group of prominent Ukrainian film-makers are demanding a cultural boycott of Russia, saying that it would be “an attempt to cleanse the world of the propaganda of a terrorist state”. Seven film-makers, including Roman Bondarchuk (Volcano), Nariman Aliev (Homeward), Alina Gorlova (This Rain Will Never Stop) and Valentyn Vasyanovych (Atlantis), have each released statements outlining their support of a boycott as well as their criticism of Russian film-makers who are failing to oppose the attack on Ukraine. Vasyanovych, whose film Atlantis premiered at the Venice film festival in 2019, said: “It is necessary to lower the iron cultural curtain around Russia. Stop any cultural collaborations with representatives of a terrorist country that threatens to destroy the whole world. Stop all communication with directors who continue to live in the Soviet or Soviet paradigm and promote messages poisoned by imperial ideology in the civilised world.” Among other Russian cultural figures, Bondarchuk directly criticises opera singer Anna Netrebko, who recently withdrew from performances with the Met in New York, saying: “Ukrainians are defending their freedom and right to exist. We need help. It is necessary to limit the influence of Russian culture in the world. Culture prepared the ideological basis for this war … Help Ukraine survive this war.” Aliev, whose 2020 film Homeward focused on the plight of Crimean Tatars, huge numbers of whom were deported from the region in 1944, adds: “[Russia is] no longer ashamed to attack a sovereign country in front of the eyes of the world, having no right or reason to do so. Russian culture has always been an instrument for legalising all crimes committed and committed by their authorities … The boycott of Russian cinema and culture is an attempt to cleanse the world of the propaganda of a terrorist state.” They join earlier statements by Oleg Sentsov, the film-maker jailed for five years in Russia, and producer Denis Ivanov, who also called for boycotts of Russia. Sentsov, who was convicted of terrorism after organising a demonstration against the 2014 annexation of Crimea, was released in 2019 and is a reservist in the national guard. In a statement he wrote: “My motherland is mercilessly shelled from the land, sea and air. Russian bombs are falling on Ukrainian children … We need your support. The support of intellectuals and artists who oppose Putin’s bloody regime. People who value human life more than anything. I request your support for the boycott of Russian [film-making] in all dimensions.” Ivanov, producer of Sentsov’s new film Rhino and Sergei Loznitsa’s Donbass, wrote in an open letter: “This war of aggression by the Russians has turned into a war on independence and a war for values and rights … On behalf of them, I’m asking for support of our boycott of Russian cinema at all international film events and all international organisations … No more ‘business as usual’ with Putin’s Russia.” Vasyanovych is reportedly currently in a village near Kyiv, Senstov has joined the defence of Kyiv, Bondarchuk is reportedly currently in western Ukraine after organising the evacuation of his children, and Gorlova is reportedly in Kyiv, volunteering for territorial defence. Ivanov has volunteered for service in a village 30km outside Kyiv. The Odesa film festival reported that actor Pasha Li has been killed in Irpen, as Russian forces shelled the town. Li had joined the territorial defence forces and posted pictures of himself in uniform on social media.",Arts/Film,Leading Ukrainian film-makers call for boycott of Russian cultural ‘propaganda’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/07/ukraine-film-makers-boycott-of-russian-cultural-propaganda-putin
3/7/2022,"Musicians around the world had to adapt quickly to the restrictions of lockdown, whether it was livestreamed gigs, inviting fans to help make an album, exploring new musical directions or something else entirely. For Bryan Adams, it was a chance to learn how to play the drums so that he could play every single instrument on his new album, So Happy It Hurts. The Canadian rocker put those new skills to use in service of his classic upbeat take on freedom-seeking rock’n’roll, one made more acute than ever when movement was restricted. “The pandemic and lockdown really brought home the truth that spontaneity can be taken away,” he said in a statement. “Suddenly all touring stopped, no one could jump in the car and go.” And so the album – and its title track – consider “freedom, autonomy, spontaneity and the thrill of the open road”, along with “many of the ephemeral things in life that are really the secret to happiness and, most importantly, human connection” You can ask the well-garlanded rocker about his new record, his vast pantheon of hits – including the UK’s longest-running No 1 single, (Everything I Do) I Do It for You and the all-time great banger When You’re Gone with Melanie C – writing the soundtrack to Pretty Woman: The Musical, his work as an acclaimed photographer (including shooting the Pirelli calendar) and anything else you fancy in the Guardian’s reader interview with Adams.

3/7/2022,"The credibility of the government’s plan to put the Royal Navy in charge of coordinating efforts to control small boats in the Channel is expected to be questioned by an influential parliamentary committee. A report by the defence select committee, to be delivered shortly, will raise doubts over whether plans to put the Royal Navy in charge have been rigorously tested. It comes amid growing unease among Tory backbenchers over the government’s plans to deal with the rising number of people arriving in the UK via small boats. Border Force officers are preparing for a fresh wave of arrivals from across the Channel amid increased pressure on the UK’s asylum system from people escaping the war in Ukraine. Last year, 28,431 people crossed the Channel in small boats – three times the number in 2020 – and Border Force unions have claimed that up to 60,000 could arrive this year. The committee will meet soon to finalise its report into Operation Isotrope, the plan to involve the armed forces in countering Channel crossings. John Spellar, the Labour vice-chair of the committee and a former defence minister, told the Guardian the policy had not been thought through. “This is a PR-driven policy which is without any coherent detail, but also poses significant difficulties and has the real risk of reputational damage for the [Ministry of Defence] and the Royal Navy. “The government has to get a coherent policy out of the Home Office in order to deal with this major crisis,” he said. In mid-January, it was announced that the military was to be put in charge of stemming the surge in people crossing the Channel in small boats and could take charge of controversial “pushback” tactics to turn away boats at sea. James Heappey, the armed forces minister, told MPs that the MoD would take over command of the operation from Border Force, and would coordinate the many government departments involved, while the money would come from each organisation’s existing budget. “Clearly this will be a multi-agency effort under Royal Navy command. Where agencies are already doing things in the Channel, they will continue to be funded by the departments that own them,” he said in reply to an urgent question. Witnesses to the committee questioned whether this would work. Former Border Force chief V Adm Sir Charles Montgomery told the committee he remained confused over the Royal Navy’s leadership role. “It does seem to me that the home secretary has not lost her responsibilities for border security and immigration control, and yet there is an important chunk that now sits in a different government department and, as I could understand from the urgent question, a different secretary of state. There is a misalignment there, which I do not quite understand,” he said. Another witness, the former Royal Navy officer Cdr Tom Sharpe, said: “Arriving in Dover full of migrants and with a white ensign on the back is reputational damage to the Royal Navy.” The decision to ask the Royal Navy to intervene was widely seen to be part of “Operation Red Meat” – policies designed to save Johnson’s premiership after allegations around parties in No 10 and Whitehall during the Covid-19 lockdown. A beleaguered No 10 indicated that the navy would soon be given the lead responsibility for dealing with refugees crossing the Channel by boat, stripping the responsibility from the home secretary, Priti Patel, and the Home Office. At the time, a defence source said they believed that one of the immediate tasks would be to restore safety to the waters around Britain after 27 people, mostly from the Kurdish region of Iraq, died in November attempting to reach the UK. A government spokesperson said that they could not comment on internal discussions with other departments on funding. “The Home Office and Ministry of Defence continue to pursue all options to prevent illegal crossings, secure our border and protect life at sea. To suggest otherwise is wrong,” he said.",News/UK news,Experts raise doubts over plan for Royal Navy to control Channel crossings,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/07/experts-raise-doubts-over-plan-for-royal-navy-to-control-channel-crossings
3/7/2022,"Mark Meadows played a key role in supporting and advancing Donald Trump’s lie about widespread electoral fraud in his defeat by Joe Biden, but the former White House chief of staff may have committed such fraud himself. According to the New Yorker, Meadows registered to vote at a property in South Carolina at which he appears never to have lived. Meadows resigned from the US House and became Trump’s fourth and last chief of staff in March 2020. He registered to vote in September, the New Yorker said. Asked for the address “where you physically live”, the magazine said, Meadows “wrote down the address of a 14ft-by-62ft mobile home in Scaly Mountain”, South Carolina, and “listed his move-in date for this address as the following day, 20 September”. “Meadows does not own this property and never has,” the New Yorker said. “It is not clear that he has ever spent a single night there.” Meadows did not comment to the magazine. The New Yorker spoke to the home’s former and current owners and neighbors and said that while members of Meadows’ family may have spent time in the property, it was not clear he ever slept there. The current owner said: “I’ve made a lot of improvements. But when I got it, it was not the kind of place you’d think the chief of staff of the president would be staying.” Told of Meadows using the address to register to vote, the owner said: “That’s weird that he would do that. Really weird.” Were Meadows to be found to have committed voter fraud, it would not be the first time he had embarrassed the president he served. In December, the Guardian was first to report that in his memoir, Meadows describes how Trump tested positive for Covid-19 but covered up the result (and a second negative) and went ahead with his first debate against Joe Biden. The memoir repeats Trump’s claims about voter fraud, lies which stoked the deadly attack on Congress on 6 January 2021. Meadows initially cooperated with the House committee investigating the attack, then withdrew. The committee recommended a charge of criminal contempt of Congress. None has been forthcoming from the Department of Justice. As the New Yorker pointed out, it is a federal crime to provide false information to register to vote in a federal election. Melanie D Thibault, director of the board of elections in Macon county, South Carolina, told the New Yorker she was “kind of dumbfounded” by Meadows’ registration. She also said he had voted absentee, by mail, in the 2020 election. Meadows’ old boss has repeatedly attacked voting by mail – despite doing it himself.",News/US news,Mark Meadows faces electoral fraud question over voter registration address,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/07/mark-meadows-voter-registration-electoral-fraud-questions-trump
3/7/2022,"There’s nothing quite like a burger night. I love trying different minces from butchers (they freeze well if you don’t use them immediately), with a good ratio of fat for flavour and texture, and I love a good veggie burger, too. With meat, I am led by the mantra “less, but better quality” (save our rivers from factory farms!), so the patties aren’t huge, but I like to go wild on the trimmings: a smorgasbord of slaws and salads, beans, crisp potato wedges or fries, tomatoes, pickles, lettuce, mayos and hot sauces. Fatty pork, liquoricey fennel and smoky chipotle with a hint of floral thyme makes for a great burger.Prep 20 minCook 20 minServes 4-6 3 tbsp olive oil1 onion, peeled and finely chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed2 tsp sweet smoked paprika (pimenton)1 tbsp thyme leaves2 tsp fennel seeds, roughly ground450g free-range pork mince60g fresh breadcrumbs (optional)Salt and black pepper4-6 slices of manchego cheese For the chipotle relish1 ½ tbsp chipotle en adobo2-3 tbsp tomato ketchup1 tsp dijon mustard½ tsp soft brown sugarA splash of red-wine vinegarBurger buns and mayonnaise, to serve Warm two tablespoons of the olive oil in a small pan over a medium heat and fry the onion, garlic and paprika for seven to eight minutes until softened. Add the thyme and fennel seeds and cook for another few minutes to warm through. Empty into a mixing bowl with the pork, breadcrumbs and plenty of salt and freshly ground pepper. Scrunch everything together with your hands to mix well, then shape into patties. Put in the fridge if not cooking immediately. Meanwhile, make the ketchup by mixing the ingredients together. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more sugar or chipotle. Heat a large griddle pan over a medium-high heat until smoking hot. Brush with a tiny bit of oil and cook the patties for two to three minutes on one side, then turn over. Put a slice of manchego on top of each one and cook the other side for two to four minutes more, depending on the size of the burgers and how you like them. You can press them with your fingers to test how cooked they are: if firm, they are well done; less firm and they will be rare and juicier, which is how I like them. Leave the burgers to rest while you toast some buns. Serve, getting everyone to build their own burgers with the relish, mayonnaise and anything else. If you are making veggie burgers instead, try mixing grated beetroot with lentils or black beans, oats and mushrooms with plenty of spices and seasoning.

3/7/2022,"Residents of Pitt Town on the flood-prone Hawkesbury-Nepean River found their designated evacuation route cut by rising water last Wednesday, forcing authorities to locate a gate key to open up the only other path out of the historic centre. That route has been partly under water twice again since Sunday, with another blockage possible on Tuesday amid yet more forecasts for heavy rain. The Bureau of Meteorology was predicting major flooding of the river, in places possibly exceeding both last week’s highs and those of March 2021. “We’ve been screaming for something to be done,” Peter Ryan, the Pitt Town progress association president, told Guardian Australia. “How many fatals do we have to have from this flood due to their lack of interest and total incompetence? Do we have to drown people in their cars trying to escape from here?” Pitt Town turns into a series of islands every time there is a flood described as a “one-in-100-year event”, meaning there is a 1% chance of that occurring in any year”. But the population has tripled in the past 15 years, increasing the number of residents who may need to evacuate from the area quickly. “We want a safe, well-maintained flood evacuation route, which doesn’t have the ability to be cut off by local water, which is what happened [last week],” Ryan said. The usual evacuation route consists of several tight bends and is in places barely wide enough for vehicles to pass. The backup route, which has a locked gate and goes through part of a national park, is in an even poorer state – it has many potholes, no speed limits, and is usually only one-way given its narrowness. “I had one mum contact me to say that she drove through [the backup evacuation route] with three kids, and she was just terrified, doing it on her own knowing she was responsible for her kids,” Susan Templeman, the local federal Labor MP, said. “You have got to wonder at how sensible it is to have a locked gate where only a limited number of people have a key to be your key escape route from what could be a very fast-rising flood. Imagine in the dark and in the rain.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Templeman recently inspected the evacuation routes with Ryan. “It was bad enough in daylight with people who knew the way … it’s very easy to miss the signs that are there,” she said. The Hawkesbury council and the state emergency services minister, Steph Cooke, were approached for comment. Mary Lyons-Buckett, a Hawkesbury councillor and former deputy mayor, called on authorities to create easier exits for residents. “I have always believed the priority around flood management and safety of our people is the capacity to ensure they can evacuate safely and without impediment,” Lyons-Buckett said. “We are seeing a lot of localised flooding and road closures. This makes it even more crucial to have designated effective routes to get people to safety.” Vince Rayfield, secretary of the Pitt Town progress association, said their group had been repeatedly rebuffed in their efforts to get documents from authorities detailing how much time the local community needed to escape in case of a worst-case flood scenario. “It takes so many hours to evacuate based on … a certain number of vehicles,” Rayfield said, adding that with a major flood “the entire population has to evacuate”. After the previous state Labor government changed the planning laws in 2006, Pitt Town had more than 1,000 additional development lots created. Most of them have been taken up. Ryan said another threat is that it only takes one tree to be blown over – and damaging winds are forecast for Tuesday and Wednesday from the east coast low – to block even those two inadequate routes out. “It’s getting to the stage we’re just going to have to have a chainsaw in the back of our cars,” he said.The challenges for local drivers have also increased because the privately owned local sewage works has little demand for its treated recycled water for local gardens. As a result, huge tankers come and go constantly. “You wouldn’t want to be behind one of those if it rolled,” Ryan said.",News/Australia news,‘Screaming for something to be done’: NSW town repeatedly cut off by floods demands safe evacuation route,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/15/screaming-for-something-to-be-done-nsw-town-repeatedly-cut-off-by-floods-demands-safe-evacuation-route
3/7/2022,"As players swapped shirts and fans began to make their way to the exits at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, Olivier Giroud ran a hand over his beard and listened to an interviewer from Dazn complimenting his Italian. His eyebrows raised at the question that followed: “You’re a bit like Zlatan [Ibrahimovic]: you give instructions, you encourage, you motivate your teammates. So now that he’s back, who plays?” It was an unexpected line of enquiry on a night when Giroud had, once again, shifted the course of Serie A’s title race, scoring the goal that delivered Milan victory over Napoli just as his two strikes had sunk Inter a month before. He blew out his cheeks and shrugged before reflecting: “I don’t want to think about who is going to play. My job is also to be a big brother to the young players.” What more could you ask of your sporting sibling than the performance Giroud turned in on Sunday? For 68 minutes, he led from the front, throwing himself into challenges even after Kalidou Koulibaly’s stud had raked a deep gouge into his left shin. By half-time he looked spent, laying flat on the turf while the rest of the players headed for the tunnel. Yet he would decide the game after the interval. It looked a lucky deflection at first, Giroud sticking out a boot to redirect Davide Calabria’s shot inside the left-hand upright after the ball was blocked twice at a free-kick. Repeat viewings showed that it was nothing of the sort. Giroud’s subtle step into the space behind Koulibaly half a beat beforehand had positioned him to be decisive on any ball that fell to the middle of the box. HIGHLIGHTS | A very important win for 🔴⚫️ in Naples: @acmilan is at the top of the table! 📈#NapoliMilan 0-1 #SerieA💎 #WeAreCalcio More memorable goals have been scored in this fixture. The prospect of these teams contesting a Scudetto had turned minds back to 1988, when the individual brilliance of Maradona collided with the collective authority of Arrigo Sacchi’s first Milan side. Their showdown that May remains one of the most acclaimed games in Italian football history, a 3-2 win for the Rossoneri sealed by Marco van Basten after a dazzling run from Ruud Gullit. There is no Maradona in today’s Napoli, besides the likenesses that the club have been printing on to their absurdly long line of replica shirts. It is hard to imagine a Milan team that finished bottom of its Champions League group conquering Europe twice in the next two years, as Sacchi’s team went on to do. Yet this has been one of the most compelling title races for many seasons. Napoli and Milan started the weekend level in first place. By the time they kicked off, Inter, had thumped Salernitana to move ahead of them. Even Juventus had temporarily closed back within four points on the back of a 14-game unbeaten run. Napoli’s manager, Luciano Spalletti, further amplified the moment, stating that his team stood at a crossroads, with a chance to either become “immortal” or be forever forgotten. Not before or since Maradona have the Partenopei been champions of Italy. There is a feeling of ‘now or never’ for a team who finished second with a club-record 91 points under Maurizio Sarri in 2018. Lorenzo Insigne overtook Maradona in the club’s scoring charts this February but will leave to join Toronto FC in June. Dries Mertens, now 34, would like to prolong his stay but no extension has yet been agreed for his contract beyond this summer. Napoli have introduced fresh talent during the intervening seasons, too, and there can be a bright future built around players such as Fabián Ruiz and the club-record signing Victor Osimhen. Still, theirs is a different scenario to that of Milan, three years into a rejuvenation project under Stefano Pioli. His pre-game remarks set the stage very differently, downplaying the importance of any one game and stressing the focus should always be on overall progress. Perhaps that framing helped his team, reducing any pressure they might have felt. Or maybe he just got his tactics right. Pioli swapped his usual 4-2-3-1 for a 4-3-3 that allowed Milan to go man-for-man across the midfield, Franck Kessié and Ismaël Bennacer pressing high on to Fabián Ruiz and Stanislav Lobotka, while Sandro Tonali sat deeper to cut off the supply to Piotr Zielinski in the No 10 role. Napoli had more of the ball, but the visitors’ aggression pushed their centre of gravity far backwards from the areas where they prefer to operate. The result was a first half of few chances, though both teams might have had a penalty: Bennacer bumped to the ground by Kalidou Koulibaly before Osimhen had his heel kicked by Fikayo Tomori. Either decision could have been given, but neither was. Instead, it was left to Giroud to break the deadlock in the 47th minute. The game opened up as Napoli pursued an equaliser, leaving Milan spaces to attack behind. It was the visitors who came closest to scoring again, Alexis Saelemaekers thwarted by David Ospina after going clean through in injury time. It finished 1-0: a landmark result. This was Napoli’s first defeat of 2022, and the first time Pioli had beaten Spalletti in 12 attempts. He had played down that narrative, too, before kick-off, insisting it would “happen sooner or later”. “I would prefer later,” joked Spalletti in response. Above all, though, this night belonged to Giroud. Perhaps Milan’s whole title bid does. The Frenchman has still only scored eight Serie A goals yet three of those have sufficed to win head-to-heads with direct Scudetto rivals Inter and Napoli in the past month. He also struck the opener in a win over Roma in January and twice in the Coppa Italia quarter-final against Lazio. He has not yet broken the supposed curse of Milan’s No 9 shirt, as it remains true that no player has hit double figures in Serie A while wearing that number since Pippo Inzaghi. Yet there is no question that he has been a defining influence on his team’s season. Internazionale 5-0 Salernitana, Cagliari 0-3 Lazio, Roma 1-0 Atalanta, Udinese 2-1 Sampdoria, Napoli 0-1 Milan, Juventus 1-0 Spezia, Venezia 1-4 Sassuolo, Fiorentina 1-1 Verona, Bologna 0-0 Torino, Genoa 0-0 Empoli At full-time on Sunday, Pioli recalled his first contact with Giroud, a video call last summer in which he said he was quickly convinced of the value that could be brought by adding a World Cup and Champions League winner to his team. “It’s important to have players with charisma and personality,” he said. “Especially for a young group like ours.” A role model can be useful to have around, when you’re trying to teach kids how to carry themselves and get their work done. Sometimes, though, the best thing about having a big brother is when they can just do the jobs that you might not have managed on your own.",Sport/Football,Why Milan’s Serie A title bid belongs to ‘big brother’ Olivier Giroud | Nicky Bandini,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/07/why-milan-serie-a-title-bid-belongs-to-big-brother-olivier-giroud
3/7/2022,"UK house prices are rising at their fastest rate since 2007, according to Halifax, with the typical property notching up its biggest annual cash gain in the nearly 40 years since the lender’s index began. Two years on from the start of the coronavirus pandemic, commentators say the housing market is continuing to defy economic conditions, with average property prices rising by another 0.5% in February, equating to £370 a week. It was the eighth month in a row that property values had risen, pushing up the annual rate of price growth to 10.8%, the highest figure since June 2007. The price of a typical home has risen by more than £38,000 since February 2020, and during the last 12 months alone £27,200 has been added to the value. “This is the biggest one-year cash rise recorded in over 39 years of index history,” a Halifax spokesperson said. This meant the average house price had hit “another new record high” of £278,123. The squeeze on household finances, fuelled by rising interest rates and inflation, does not as yet appear to have done much to dent the market’s buoyancy. Estate agents and others have said a shortage of homes for sale is continuing to drive prices up, while the pandemic has prompted many people living in urban areas to look at relocating somewhere with more open space, such as a village or small town in the countryside or by the sea. However, the events in Ukraine are expected to help put the brakes on the market. Russell Galley, Halifax’s managing director, said: “The war in Ukraine is a human tragedy but is also likely to have effects on confidence, trade and global supply chains.” He said soaring oil and gas prices were one immediate consequence, meaning that UK inflation – already at a 30-year peak – would remain higher for longer, adding to the squeeze on already stretched household incomes. Meanwhile, further interest rate increases looked likely in the near term. “These factors are likely to weigh on buyer demand as the year progresses, with market activity likely to return to more normal levels, and an easing of house price growth to be expected,” Galley said. Wales was the strongest-performing nation or region in terms of house price growth, with prices typically up by 13.8% over the past year, while south-west England was close behind at 13.4%. By contrast, the figure for London was 5.4%. Lewis Shaw, who founded the mortgage broker Shaw Financial Services, said the UK property market had “gone down the rabbit hole”, adding: “Economic logic suggests prices should be coming down but the surreal lack of stock is keeping values buoyant.” Sarah Coles, an analyst at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “House prices can’t escape reality for ever. Eventually buyers will have to face the fact that life is getting more expensive and unpredictable, and we’ll see these record price rises slow significantly.”",News/Business,"UK house prices rise at fastest rate in 15 years, says Halifax",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/07/uk-house-prices-rise-at-fastest-rate-in-15-years-says-halifax
3/7/2022,"Even the chants of “Korkut raus” – Korkut out – directed at the bench sounded apathetic. Hertha BSC are in serious trouble at the bottom of the Bundesliga and perhaps the worst of it is that hope seems to have left the stands of the cavernous Olympiastadion already. Statistically speaking, there are still further depths to be plumbed. Saturday’s emphatic 4-1 defeat at home to Eintracht Frankfurt, Hertha’s fourth in a row in the Bundesliga, means they are still third-from-bottom and thus still not in the automatic relegation places, though Stuttgart’s rousing comeback from two goals down to beat Borussia Mönchengladbach means they are now only a single point adrift of the Berliners. Yet to describe this as a new low or to employ any associated clichés would just be a denial of the stark truth. Hertha are lost in a tangle of their own making and there doesn’t seem to be the energy to find a solution, or the fury to tear their way out, as things stand. “Everyone here has to be pissed off enough to work their arses off for the three points,” blasted defender Marc-Oliver Kempf, who arrived just before the January transfer deadline and must feel like a kids’ party entertainer arriving midway through a food fight after the guests have each scoffed three packets of Tangfastics apiece. Coming from outside the bubble has clearly been a shock. To say Hertha are yet to win in 2022 is factually correct, but doesn’t really provide the requisite detail of just how bad they’ve been. On Sunday morning Transfermarkt.de produced a table, much-discussed in the German media, of Hertha’s results in those last nine games, which make them the least successful team in all of Europe’s top five leagues over that period, with just two points and a goal difference of -18. The second-worst, Granada, who have taken three points in the same spell, fired their coach Robert Moreno on Sunday. In the whole of Tayfun Korkut’s time in charge – he took over in late November – the team have won two, lost eight and drawn three. What’s more is that the numbers probably flatter them, despite the coach’s frequent protestations that the manner of defeats have been harsh. A beating like this, from opponents that were organised but not exactly imperious (Ansgar Knauff’s goal was Eintracht’s first in 300 minutes), should be the straw that breaks the camel’s back but they’ve been here before. And in this calendar year. The humiliation at the hands of Leipzig in the last home game. The defeat at long-since-done Greuther Fürth. Being dumped out of the Pokal here by near neighbours Union, which led to fan protests. Berlin author and Hertha fan Lucas Vogelsang compared his team in a recent interview to “a man who falls from the 50th floor of a skyscraper and says to himself on the way down – so far it’s actually been going quite well”. What will it take to rouse Hertha? It’s not money. Even if we were in a transfer window with the potential to reshape Hertha have shown their inability to spend effectively, having used nearly €400m of Lars Windhorst’s cash since summer 2019. Fredi Bobic is clearly reluctant to make another coaching change, even if there is little to suggest that Korkut has solutions to offer. Rafael Santos Borré’s fourth goal for the visitors on Saturday, precisely 73 seconds after Davie Selke’s belting shot offered the hosts a glimmer of hope, underlined how quickly rays of light are shut out in the current setup. “Now would be the right time,” wrote Morgenpost’s Inga Böddeling. “Nine match days are left to reach the shore under your own steam. Or,” she continued, “to secure two extra games and the chance to stay up via the play-off.” That is how desperate things are now – that making the play-off against the third-placed team in Bundesliga 2 seems like one of the better scenarios. “In a situation like this,” recognised Korkut, “you can’t expect any declarations of love,” nodding towards the chants from the stands. More concerning, with or without Korkut, is the lack of fire on and off the pitch. A lot must change to avert what currently appears inevitable. Arminia Bielefeld 0-1 Augsburg, Stuttgart 3-2 Borussia Mönchengladbach, Wolfsburg 1-0 Union Berlin, RB Leipzig 1-1 Freiburg, Hertha Berlin 1-4 Eintracht Frankfurt, Bochum 2-1 Greuther Fürth, Bayern Munich 1-1 Bayer Leverkusen, Cologne 0-1 Hoffenheim.  With that Stuttgart victory, the relegation battle is more open than ever. Sasa Kalajdzic’s late winner breathes new life into their charge, but Gladbach’s dressing room didn’t mince its words after a setback which keeps them firmly in the mix. “I think we deserved to lose today,” Yann Sommer told Sky. “They were a class above us in every respect.” Next up for Adi Hütter’s team is another Saturday Top (Bottom?)-Spiel – against Hertha. 📽️ An absolutely stunning comeback from @VfB_Int, turning around a two goal deficit to triumph 3-2 over @Borussia_EN!A #Bundesliga classic. 🤌 pic.twitter.com/Q6ts0H3Kvz  As the Bundesliga continued its anti-war demonstrations, it replaced the normal red and white Bundesliga logo on television graphics with a special blue and yellow one to represent the colours of Ukraine, while alternating Bayern Munich players, for example, wore blue or yellow track jackets as they observed the pre-kick-off minute of reflection by the centre circle. Match TV in Russia, meanwhile, superimposed the original Bundesliga logo over the version in support of Ukraine in their broadcasts.

The visiting players spoke of a missed opportunity afterwards, with Jeremie Frimpong missing a big opening near the end, the best of a number of possibilities created on the counter. “I’m not disappointed,” said coach Gerardo Seoane, “but when you see the chances we had, you think we could have done something more.”  There was more potential good news for Leverkusen, with managing director Fernando Carro telling Bild’s Die Lage der Liga that he expects Florian Wirtz to stay for two more years – not just one – as he aims to seal his place in the Germany team for the home Euros. “We’re trying to keep him for as long as possible,” emphasised Carro, “but I assume he won’t leave before 2024.”  Mainz v Borussia Dortmund was postponed after the home side reported 20 Covid infections within their first-team group, including 14 players and coach Bo Svensson. Sporting director Christian Heidel confirmed to Bild on Sunday that the club were trying to postpone Saturday’s scheduled game with Augsburg, and are expecting a quick decision from the league.  Union Berlin fans had plenty to be irritated about by Saturday evening. They dominated at Wolfsburg but fell to a single-goal defeat, brought on by Taiwo Awoniyi’s unfortunate header into his own net, and the loss came at the hands of Max Kruse’s new team. The 2,500 travelling Berliners gave their former favourite a hot reception after his abrupt January exit – and a quite audible one in one of the Bundesliga’s, ahem, less fervent grounds – with a few rounds of “Max Kruse ist ein Hurensohn”, the popular chant to the tune of Belinda Carlisle’s Heaven Is A Place On Earth. Kruse’s response? To join in with the singing.

3/7/2022,"In 2019, the United Nations World Tourism Organization reported that international travel had increased to a record 1.4 billion tourist arrivals. It predicted a 3% to 4% annual increase in coming years. That didn’t happen, of course. At the end of 2021, international tourist arrivals were 72% below pre-pandemic levels with 1 billion fewer arrivals than two years earlier. This is despite airlines’ ingenuity. During Australian lockdown, Qantas organised flights to nowhere: one left Sydney for a fly-by tour of Byron Bay and the Gold Coast, the Great Barrier Reef and Uluru; another in May last year took passengers to 43,000ft to see the blood-red supermoon. According to UNWTO’s executive director, Zoritsa Urosevic, tourism has been the sector hit hardest by Covid-19 and, while countries such as China were able to switch to domestic tourism, smaller nations such as Fiji, where tourism represents between 40% and 70% of GDP, fared far worse. The pandemic put an estimated 120m tourism jobs at risk. The organisation reckons that by 2024 international tourism will have returned to pre-pandemic levels. Surely that is a good thing. “There hasn’t been a war in Europe for 50 years because they’re all too busy flying on Ryanair,” the airline’s Michael O’Leary once told me. “I should get the Nobel peace prize – screw Bono.” If Covid’s impact ameliorates as hoped, it will be replaced by a new virus – wanderlust. Millennials, according to one survey, would rather travel than have sex – and not only because they’re probably doing the latter wrong. Great Britain’s tourist board, VisitBritain, makes a strong economic case for tourism: its impact is amplified through the economy because for every £1,000 generated in direct tourism, a further £1,800 arises thanks to supply chain and consumer spending. In that context, it is not just our pleasure but our duty to help out Britain’s beleaguered Basil Fawltys and their Fijian equivalents. But the value of tourism, like sex, depends on how you do it. Cruise ships generate 21,000 gallons of sewage per day per vessel, much of it ending up in the sea. In 2019, transport-related emissions from tourism were responsible for 5% of human-made global carbon dioxide emissions, according to UNWTO. The planet-despoiling propensities of tourism were poignantly captured in the New York Times’s list of 52 Places to Visit in 2020. One of them, Louisiana’s Grand Isle, faces one of the world’s highest rates of relative sea level rise. “Does a place appear more hauntingly beautiful when you know it’s disappearing?” asked the NYT’s writer, seemingly unaware that encouraging tourism to the seven mile long barrier island might hasten its vanishing into the Gulf of Mexico. Another entry suggested that “with that mile-thick ice sheet melting fast, and two new international airports slated to open in 2023, the time to explore an untrammelled, intact Greenland is now”. True, sustainable tourism is a growing phenomenon but, arguably, it heals the planet only in the way putting a plaster over a gunshot wound does. Ecotourism in 2019 represented just over 2% of the whole sector: the former was valued at $181.1bn (£133bn), while in the same year tourism as a whole was worth nearly $9tn, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council. Furthermore, there are discrepancies between what tourists say and what they do. According to a recent survey by Elegant Resorts, 99% of the luxury operator’s customers said sustainable travel was important to them. But the company also noted that there had been a huge increase in inquiries about private jets, perhaps prompted by grisly airport and in-flight experiences. Less well established is what tourism risks doing, not to balances of payments and the planet, but to our souls. Today, in what Marshall McLuhan called our global village, tourism is not what it was. Food from around the world can be brought to your door, and you can engage in all kinds of cultural appropriation and virtual tourism without leaving the comfort of your home. Microsoft’s slogan, “Where do you want to go today?”, typifies how practically all human activity takes place in a hyperculture in which the world has been reduced to goods in a supermarket of experiences, all readily consumable and disposable. In that context, tourism risks not so much broadening the mind as narrowing it. This, at least, is the suggestion of a newly translated book called Hyperculture. In it, the Korean-German philosopher Byung-Chul Han argues there is no longer any real difference between indigenous and foreign, near and far. Travel used to uproot us valuably from our own soil and confront us with the other. Consider what made pilgrims put on their travelling shoes. “He or she is not completely at home Here, and so goes to a special There,” he writes. The first tourists, Han suggests, were similar to pilgrims in that they were seeking the mind-expanding shock of the new. What makes today’s tourists different from previous travellers, Han says, is that globalisation creates what he calls a “global Here by de-distancing and de-siting the There”. We don’t really go from Here to There when we travel any more, he argues. We are 21st-century J Alfred Prufrocks. While TS Eliot’s Prufrock measured out his life in coffee spoons, today’s hypercultural tourists can map their holidays through visits to identikit Starbucks in ostensibly exotic locales. Tourism is attractive because it underwrites a desire that, when we go overseas, stuff doesn’t get too strange, risky or foreign. Increasingly, we travel not to decentre our worldviews or challenge our sensibilities, but to chillax and populate our Instagrams. In Human, All Too Human, Friedrich Nietzsche foresaw today’s itchy feet: “The less men are bound by their tradition, the greater the internal stirring of motives; the greater, accordingly, the external unrest, the whirling flow of men, the polyphony of strivings.” As fear of Covid fades, air miles are likely to be racked up exponentially. The impulse to seek new horizons is understandable after so long cooped up – but as we queue miserably in non-EU lines to fly to social-media friendly destinations, will we really be rewarded with what we’re presumably seeking: reinvigoration, and a change of mind? Nature, too, which has been recuperating from the impact of humanity’s carbon footprint for two years, is poised to be despoiled anew. French philosopher Blaise Pascal wrote: “All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.” He had a point.
