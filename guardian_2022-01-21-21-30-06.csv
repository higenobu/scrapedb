1/21/2022,"More than a dozen aid organisations have called for humanitarian exemptions to heavy sanctions imposed on Mali after the military leadership postponed planned February elections. The EU has announced support for the sanctions imposed earlier this month by the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), which include closing borders and a trade embargo.  But this week, 13 international groups working in Mali warned of devastating consequences for the population, a third of whom rely on aid. Humanitarian access is hindered by the Malian interim authorities’ decision to reciprocate border closures with Ecowas member states, except Guinea. Thousands of people demonstrated against the sanctions last week in the capital Bamako, carrying placards saying “down with Ecowas” and “down with France”. The country is in the grip of the worst food insecurity in 10 years. A joint letter signed by the NGOs, including the International Rescue Committee (IRC), Care and the Norwegian Refugee Council, said: “To continue their work effectively, humanitarian actors must have unfettered access for the transportation of life-saving goods including food and medicine, as well as guarantees that they can transfer funds into the country without violating the sanctions.” Mali’s current insecurity dates back to early 2012 when northern separatists rebelled against the government. Islamist militants that initially allied with the separatists, including Ansar Dine, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), and the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, ultimately hijacked the rebellion. France, the former colonial ruler, made a military intervention in 2013 on the government’s side against the militants. The UN has also deployed an estimated 18,000 peacekeeping staff, in what was called its most dangerous mission. The Malian military, led by Col Assimi Goïta, has conducted two coups in two years and reneged on promises to hold new elections. The junta’s most recent power grab, in May 2021, was the fifth coup since Mali’s independence in 1960 and it has been unwilling to commit to transition to civilian rule, despite international pressures. Postponement of elections has been blamed on Islamist insecurity, an impasse that has deepened with the arrival of private military contractors belonging to the Russian mercenary firm Wagner Group. European states have condemned Wagner’s presence, concerned it will enable the military to hold on to power. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said this month that EU sanctions on Mali were in part in response to the involvement of Russian contractors. France is withdrawing troops, but 14 other EU members, led by Sweden, had established a taskforce to replace them in a three-year mandate. As tensions intensified over the Wagner Group, Sweden said last week that it had decided to withdraw its troops. France, which holds the rotating EU presidency, has been vociferous in its support of sanctions but Russia and China have blocked the UN security council’s move to follow suit. Ecowas has frozen financial aid and Malian assets at the Central Bank of West African States. Elena Vicario, director for the Norwegian Refugee Council in Mali, said: “Malians are already bearing the brunt of the humanitarian catastrophe, punctuated by horrifying attacks against civilians. Sanctions must not hold us back from delivering essential assistance in a country where drought, rising insecurity, and the economic impacts of Covid-19 are already pushing millions of Malians over the edge.” Franck Vannetelle, the IRC’s country director in Mali, echoed Vicario, saying: “Despite more than a third of the country’s population being dependent on humanitarian aid, organisations working in Mali already face severe access constraints. It’s imperative that the international community keeps responding to people’s urgent needs, and that any new sanctions have concrete humanitarian exemptions. These must be monitored and implemented, or the most vulnerable people in Mali will pay the price.”",News/Global development,"Vulnerable Malians could ‘pay the price’ of heavy sanctions, warn aid groups",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/21/vulnerable-malians-could-pay-the-price-of-heavy-sanctions-warn-aid-groups
1/21/2022,"Is a Great Easing under way? Superficially, it seems not. In New York, everyone is still masked. Teachers send kids home with Covid test kits at the slightest symptom and advise them to stay away until they have two negative results in the bag. In Chicago, the schools shut down for a week then reopened, while Eric Adams, the mayor of New York, freaked everyone out last Friday by making ominous noises about potential school shutdowns in the city.  At the same time, the numbers are nose-diving. This week, daily reported cases in New York were 49% lower than two weeks ago. At the weekend we went to a party for a kid turning seven. It was modest in scope: as well as the birthday girl, just three other kids and their parents, all vaccinated including the children. It wasn’t in a freezing park. We weren’t muffled in masks. It was in an apartment, with pizza, cake, wine and chat of a kind most of us have had with only the closest family and friends for two years. I used to dread kids’ parties, but all week I looked forward to it like a golden-ticketed event. It didn’t disappoint. The party started at 2pm and at 7pm we were still there, sitting on sofas, talking to one another while the kids played with no need for our input. It was an odd thing, to derive such pleasure from something that used to be a chore, while being reminded of the thrill of new people. By the end of the evening, the adults were so high on the novelty of interacting in comfort, we decided to do it all over again in a few weekends’ time. We lost our heads and wondered if, during the forthcoming week-long winter break, we might save ourselves hundreds in camp fees and rotate to each take the kids for a day. We stopped short of devising plans to sell our apartments and embark on a commune, but for a hot second, standing outside the apartment building afterwards, it seemed as if Covid had given birth to a brave new world, beckoning us over the horizon. How is Donald Trump not in jail? This is the kind of thought that I’ve enjoyed not having for a year and that resurfaced on Tuesday night after watching Four Hours at the Capitol, the very good HBO documentary about the 6 January insurrection. This week the net closed a little tighter on Trump as the congressional inquiry into last year’s attack on the Capitol requested testimony from Ivanka Trump. Meanwhile, the supreme court turned down Trump’s request to block a release to the committee of White House records. In this context, the documentary was mindblowing. Like a lot of people, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and attacked police last year, I avoided absorbing too much of the footage for reasons of self-preservation. I couldn’t take any more of him or his people, or what they were doing to American democracy. To see it clearly now, for the first time, was a shock. One forgets how blatantly Trump fomented the trouble, urging his supporters to march on the Capitol, then refusing to call them off when they breached the boundaries. To hear the then president address people who had just broken into Congress in the gentlest, most encouraging terms – “you had an election that was stolen, but you have to go home now,” followed by “we love you, you’re very special, go home” – was staggering. More shocking was the passivity of the police. One felt for them, massively outnumbered and with Trump failing to call out the national guard. Watching the documentary, however, it was impossible to imagine rioters who weren’t white and rightwing being greeted with a failure to draw their weapons. The privilege of white male rioters shouting “you work for us” at the cops, and the tones in which some of the police replied – “is there any chance I could get you guys to leave the Senate wing?” says one officer – are extraordinary. At the time, there was much discussion about whether the Trump supporters were a well-organised force or a bunch of easily led jokers. A photographer for the New York Times who followed them into the Capitol that day said it best: “There are some people here who are fucking around and playing dress-up, and there are some people here who are not fucking around.” When the mob itself is the weapon, it takes both types for an insurrection. Clinging to the vapours of my January self-improvement drive, I cook a massive tray of brussels sprouts, to the dismay of other residents on my hallway. Something has happened to sprouts since I was a kid. It’s not only improved cooking methods, although there is that. My mother, who hated the English for, among other things, overcooking their vegetables, never overcooked a sprout in her life, but she did boil them and god they tasted bad. Metallic, with a bitter aftertaste. Obviously, I roast mine. Anyway, it’s not changing palates or faulty memory, either. If you look into it, seed companies in the Netherlands in the 1990s investigated what gave sprouts that bitter taste and invested in new seed varieties with lower amounts of glucosinolates. Now these babies are the types most often sold in supermarkets and if cooked right they’re absurdly delicious: crisp, nutty, sweet. “Here,” I say to a passing child, “try one, it tastes like candy.” (She ignores me.) The failure of American Vogue’s Twitter feed to respond in a timely fashion to the death of André Leon Talley, style icon and former Vogue editor, struck many on the platform as a deliberate slight. Leon Talley, who fell out with Anna Wintour towards the end of his tenure at the magazine and spent the last years of his life talking bitterly and with justification about racism at Vogue, died on Tuesday at the age of 73, a fact it took his former employers until the next day to acknowledge. Talley was, in lots of ways, the antithesis to the Condé Nast fashion plate: loud, voluble, expansive, and for all his history of difficulty with food, able to enjoy a large lunch. He took up space in a crowd otherwise committed to an instinctive shrinking inwards and away from joy. My kids are off school with suspected Covid, again. As we wait for the second test result, 24 hours after the first (negative), I fight off flashbacks to the home-schooling months of 2020. I’m not good at hiding my impatience, or dismay. “Do what you like, but I’m not entertaining or educating you,” I say, and retreat to my room to do a Wordle. They repair to their iPads for a solid day of Roblox and Henry Danger.

1/21/2022,"Thomas Tuchel seemed to have all the right answers a year ago. In fact, the only time he was unsure about how to respond was when Chelsea approached him about replacing Frank Lampard. After all, Tuchel had just experienced a bitter split with Paris Saint-Germain and the thought of going to Chelsea did not immediately appear to be the wisest move. Questions had to be answered. What if Tuchel found life at Stamford Bridge just as draining as at PSG? Would he ever want to work at a top club again? Or would he decide that he no longer needed to handle star egos and demanding executives?  As discussions with Chelsea progressed, though, Tuchel came round to the idea. The powerful director Marina Granovskaia did not listen when the German asked whether she really wanted to fire a club legend. Lampard was gone and Tuchel, who had built a rapport with the club’s technical and performance adviser, Petr Cech, was in. The pressure was on. Chelsea had slipped to ninth and the dressing room was an unhappy place. Tuchel focused on restoring harmony, introduced greater tactical nous and, although Chelsea limped into fourth place and lost the FA Cup final to Leicester, the season ended on a high when Manchester City were defeated in the Champions League final. By then Tuchel could do no wrong. He outsmarted Pep Guardiola in Porto and, having signed on an initial 18-month deal, triggered a clause stating that he would receive another two years if he won the Champions League or Premier League. Tuchel, who met Roman Abramovich the morning after beating City, was content. He had embraced the culture at Chelsea, who left him to focus on coaching, and he could trust Granovskaia and Cech not to interfere. Managing upwards was not a problem for Tuchel, who had learned from clashing with his bosses at PSG and Borussia Dortmund, and it seemed that Chelsea were ready to challenge City’s domestic supremacy. Now, though, the notion of Chelsea overtaking City feels improbable. The European champions lie 12 points behind Guardiola’s side and Tuchel was downbeat during his side’s 1-1 draw with Brighton last Wednesday. It is hard not to wonder whether this is the start of a gradual decline. Chelsea have won four of their past 13 league games before hosting Tottenham on Sunday and although the squad is behind Tuchel, problems have cropped up. There is no sign of Antonio Rüdiger, César Azpilicueta and Andreas Christensen extending before their deals run out this summer and Romelu Lukaku’s £97.5m move from Internazionale has not worked out. Hailed as the final piece in the jigsaw, Lukaku mostly looks out of place. The Belgian’s body language was poor against Brighton – his argument with the increasingly unsettled Hakim Ziyech at half-time was revealing – and his controversial interview with Sky Italia remains a source of tension. It felt pointed when Tuchel criticised Lukaku after Chelsea’s defeat by City last weekend. Yet was it a risk? Player power has been a recurring theme during the Abramovich era and Tuchel must know that it would be easier for the club to side with their record signing. Yet it would be absurd to ponder parting with Tuchel. He has made mistakes – he could have rotated more, his approach in both games against City was too passive and he has not got the best out of Lukaku – but they are not terminal. Covid absentees, a draining fixture list and injuries have played a part. N’Golo Kanté has struggled to stay fit and it is not making excuses to point out that Chelsea are not the same without Ben Chilwell and Reece James, their first-choice wing-backs. Part of this is self-inflicted. Last summer Tuchel wanted a right-sided defender, but Chelsea could not agree a fee with Sevilla for Jules Koundé. Now the 32-year-old Azpilicueta is filling in for the hamstrung James at right wing-back when there could have been an opening for Tariq Lamptey or Tino Livramento, two gifted academy products. It is a worrying trend. Livramento has flourished at Southampton and Lamptey has been a revelation at Brighton, but neither youngster saw a pathway at Chelsea. The feeling is that the squad still contains too many players whose time has gone. For instance, it is no surprise that Alonso has not been as dynamic as Chilwell on the left. The 31-year-old has never been quick. He should have been moved on a while ago and yet, with Lyon reluctant to release Emerson Palmieri from his loan, the only alternative to the Spaniard is Kenedy after his return from Flamengo. Is Kenedy, who has not played for Chelsea since 2018, the solution? Clearly not, yet he is not the only player whose presence raises an eyebrow. Why, for example, is Ross Barkley still around? Is Saúl Ñíguez, who has struggled since joining on loan from Atlético Madrid, more use in midfield than Billy Gilmour or Conor Gallagher? There has to be more regeneration. This squad has been put together by six permanent managers: Roberto Di Matteo, José Mourinho, Antonio Conte, Maurizio Sarri, Frank Lampard and Tuchel. There is no clear playing identity and although a ruthless streak has brought Chelsea plenty of trophies, that approach is beginning to look outdated when City ensure that everything runs smoothly under Guardiola and Liverpool are built in Jürgen Klopp’s image. Chelsea, who have not challenged for the title for five years, need a rethink. This season they have won the Super Cup and could win the Club World Cup and Carabao Cup next month, but that is not enough. The hierarchy must look inward and ask whether they would have given Klopp five years to win a title, or allowed Guardiola to keep building after winning nothing in his first season in England. The difference is stark. City are not significantly richer than Chelsea, but their operation is calmer. They prepared for Guardiola’s arrival, have a clear style and know how to win titles. By contrast Tuchel arrived mid-season and is playing catch-up with Klopp and Guardiola. Admittedly Tuchel’s squad is hugely expensive. He has Lukaku, Christian Pulisic, Ziyech, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Timo Werner, Mason Mount and Kai Havertz in attack, but Chelsea remain blunt. The front players have not improved under Tuchel. This time last year, though, Lampard was talking about how Chelsea no longer had “goal or assist machines” such as Diego Costa and Eden Hazard. The attack feels thrown together. Lampard said that Chelsea were not ready to win the league and not much has changed. It should give Chelsea pause for thought. Cech and Granovskaia worked with Tuchel when Lukaku stepped out of line, but more is required. By repeatedly letting underperforming players off the hook and adhering to a cycle of hiring and firing, Chelsea have become a cup team. It is too volatile and, while there will always be enough talent for a clever coach to make an instant impact, Tuchel’s one-year anniversary next Wednesday should prompt Chelsea to consider why they are behind City. It is not about money, it is about culture, and Chelsea need to let Tuchel create a new one if they want to win the league.",Sport/Football,A year of Thomas Tuchel: Chelsea remain a cup club in need of new culture,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/21/a-year-of-thomas-tuchel-chelsea-remain-a-cup-club-in-need-of-new-culture
1/21/2022,"The boss of BrewDog has been accused of trying to intimidate former staff who are due to appear in a critical documentary that will shine a light on the beer brand’s workplace culture. The self-styled “punk” brewery, which is targeting an eventual £2bn stock market float, apologised last year after current and former employees signed an open letter alleging a “culture of fear” in which workers were bullied and “treated like objects”.  Some of the allegations will be revisited in a BBC documentary, Disclosure: The Truth About BrewDog, due to air on Monday evening. But in fresh posts on BrewDog’s “Equity for Punks” forum, the company’s chief executive, James Watt, appeared to attempt to warn sources who gave evidence to the BBC that their identities could be exposed. In the forum, which is seen by investors and some staff, he said: “All of this is very, very likely to end up in court.” He said the BBC “will likely have told sources that their identity will remain anonymous”. But he said anonymity “can never be guaranteed” and a court could order the BBC to name former staff who contributed to the programme. “If anyone is in any way concerned by this, it is not too late to withdraw your consent,” he said. A spokesperson for the Unite trade union criticised Watt’s comments. “Any attempt to intimidate current and former workers taking a stand on systemic mistreatment will not be tolerated,” said Bryan Simpson, an industrial organiser for Unite Hospitality. “We will represent all Unite members fully against efforts by a multimillionaire to silence them.” Watt said: “We … know false information has been given to the BBC, which if broadcast would be highly defamatory. BrewDog fully supports transparency and investigative journalism. However, it must also protect itself from defamatory allegations and will not hesitate to do so.” Last year 61 former workers signed an open letter under the banner “Punks with Purpose”. They alleged that the Scottish brewer’s dizzyingly rapid growth had involved cutting corners on health and safety, espousing values it did not live by, and creating a “toxic” culture that left to staff suffering from mental illness. The company, whose meteoric rise has attracted admiration as well as criticism for its sometimes controversial PR stunts, has since apologised and performed a review of its workplace culture. Watt has repeatedly promised to learn from the experience, while also casting doubt on the integrity of some of the complainants.

1/21/2022,"Nanoplastic pollution has been detected in polar regions for the first time, indicating that the tiny particles are now pervasive around the world. The nanoparticles are smaller and more toxic than microplastics, which have already been found across the globe, but the impact of both on people’s health is unknown.  Analysis of a core from Greenland’s ice cap showed that nanoplastic contamination has been polluting the remote region for at least 50 years. The researchers were also surprised to find that a quarter of the particles were from vehicle tyres. Nanoparticles are very light and are thought to be blown to Greenland on winds from cities in North America and Asia. The nanoplastics found in sea ice in McMurdo Sound in Antarctica are likely to have been transported by ocean currents to the remote continent. Plastics are part of the cocktail of chemical pollution that pervades the planet, which has passed the safe limit for humanity, scientists reported on Tuesday. Plastic pollution has been found from the summit of Mount Everest to the depths of the oceans. People are known to inadvertently eat and breathe microplastics and another recent study found that the particles cause damage to human cells. Dušan Materić, at Utrecht University in the Netherlands and who led the new research, said: “We detected nanoplastics in the far corners of Earth, both south and north polar regions. Nanoplastics are very toxicologically active compared to, for instance, microplastics, and that’s why this is very important.” The Greenland ice core was 14 metres deep, representing layers of snowfall dating back to 1965. “The surprise for me was not that we detected nanoplastics there, but that we detected it all the way down the core,” said Materić. “So although nanoplastics are considered as a novel pollutant, it has actually been there for decades.” Microplastics had been found in Arctic ice before, but Materić’s team had to develop new detection methods to analyse the much smaller nanoparticles. Previous work had also suggested that dust worn from tyres was likely to be a major source of ocean microplastics and the new research provides real-world evidence. The new study, published in the journal Environmental Research, found 13 nanograms of nanoplastics per millilitre of melted ice in Greenland but four times more in the Antarctic ice. This is probably because the process of forming sea ice concentrates the particles. In Greenland, half the nanoplastics were polyethylene (PE), used in single-use plastic bags and packaging. A quarter were tyre particles and a fifth were polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is used in drinks bottles and clothing. Half the nanoplastics in the Antarctic ice were PE as well, but polypropylene was the next most common, used for food containers and pipes. No tyre particles were found in Antarctica, which is more distant from populated areas. The researchers took samples only from the centres of the ice cores to avoid contamination, and tested their system with control samples of pure water. Previous studies have found plastic nanoparticles in rivers in the UK, seawater from the North Atlantic and lakes in Siberia, and snow in the Austrian alps. “But we assume the hotspots are continents where people live,” said Materić. The researchers wrote: “Nanoplastics have shown various adverse effects on organisms. Human exposure to nanoplastics can result in cytotoxicity [and] inflammation.” “The most important thing as a researcher is to accurately measure [the pollution] and then assess the situation,” Materić said. “We are in a very early stage to draw conclusions. But it seems that everywhere we have analysed, it is a very big problem. How big? We don’t know yet.” Research is starting to be carried out on the impact of plastic pollution on health and Dr Fay Couceiro is leading a new microplastics group at the University of Portsmouth, UK. One of its first projects is with Portsmouth hospitals university NHS trust and will investigate the presence of microplastics in the lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. The research will investigate whether recently carpeted or vaccumed rooms, which can have a high number of fibres in the air, trigger the patients’ conditions. “Aside from the environmental damage caused by plastics, there is growing concern about what inhaling and ingesting microplastics is doing to our bodies,” said Couceiro. Her recent research suggested people may be breathing 2,000–7,000 microplastics per day in their homes. Prof Anoop Jivan Chauhan, a respiratory specialist at Portsmouth hospitals university NHS trust, said: “This data is really quite shocking. Potentially we each inhale or swallow up to 1.8m microplastics every year and once in the body, it’s hard to imagine they’re not doing irreversible damage.”",News/Environment,Nanoplastic pollution found at both of Earth’s poles for first time,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/21/nanoplastic-pollution-found-at-both-of-earths-poles-for-first-time

1/21/2022," The Memory Monster by Yishai Sarid, translated by Yardenne Greenspan (Serpent’s Tail, £12.99)“This is where the illusion we call humankind was erased,” a guide to Holocaust sites tells the visitors on his tour. He is so steeped in its history that he has become corrupted by the horror, increasingly unable to see good in the world (humans are “worms with aspirations”) and even applying its grim lessons (“it’s all about power, power, power”) to his son’s problems at school. Sarid boldly highlights the risks of “harnessing [ourselves] to the memory chariot” and of how remembrance can calcify our views, in this complex, rewarding story of a man brought low by good intentions. Love in the Big City by Sang Young Park, translated by Anton Hur (Tilted Axis, £9.99)It’s a mark of the generous spirit of the South Korean author’s English-language debut that it made me laugh on the first page. The novel’s loosely autobiographical account of a young gay man losing and finding his way in a conservative society isn’t always so funny, but even bad news is delivered with a spark. “Your mother has cancer! In the uterus! Hallelujah.” Despite the loss of friends, lovers and parents, “the only three things floating around my brain were iced Americano, Kylie Minogue and sex”. Kylie’s name later becomes a euphemism for something darker, and the modulation of tone casts out any initial fear that the novel might just skate across the surface. Land of Snow and Ashes by Petra Rautiainen, translated by David Hackston (Pushkin, £12.99)In 1944 Finland reversed its second world war allegiance to the Nazis following a treaty with Russia. This debut novel is set in part during that shaky period, narrated by a soldier working in a Nazi camp in the northern town of Inari, “at the edge of the earth”. His diary alternates with the story of photographer Inkeri after the war, ostensibly reporting on the loss of the local Sámi culture, but really looking for her husband who went missing in the war. In the 1944 sections, we find out what happened to him. Rautiainen’s prose is occasionally clunky as it makes points about cultural domination (“Photography was about power – a form of manipulation”), but the book reveals so much more about a war we thought we knew that it feels like a potted epic. The Child Who by Jeanne Benameur, translated by Bill Johnston (Les Fugitives, £8.99)A woman has disappeared: the central character in this elliptical novella is no longer there. Her son wanders through the neighbourhood in rural France, imagining a dog for company, singing to scare off loneliness. His father and grandmother are also affected by the silence that has taken the woman’s place. Rather than a plot, the book is driven by reflections on the love between parent and child and between husband and wife. And then there’s a first-person narrator who talks to the child directly: “I’d like to say to you that the world is immense and lovely, that there’s a path for you too.” It adds a sweet overtone to the sadness of this curious and pleasing story. Tropic of Violence by Nathacha Appanah, translated by Geoffrey Strachan (MacLehose, £8.99)This brilliantly vivid novel explores lives and afterlives on the island of Mayotte, a French territory in the Indian Ocean. Central to the story is Moïse, a “wild boy” of 15 abandoned by his mother, adopted by nurse Marie, and then alone again when Marie dies. Mayotte is a “sweet, beautiful country” but Moïse is stuck in its run-down “dump” known locally as Gaza. He falls in with a criminal gang, before killing its leader – and all this in the first 20 pages. The pace is kept lively by multiple narrators, some of whom are dead, but as Moïse – still a child, who all along just wants “someone to fix me a bowl of cereal” – discovers, death is not the end.",Arts/Books,The best recent translated fiction – review roundup,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/21/the-best-recent-translated-fiction-review-roundup
1/21/2022,"Imoved into my present apartment seven years ago, and my six crates of papers moved with me – directly from one closet, where they had squatted undisturbed for five years, to another, where the same fate awaited. For almost two decades, these things have followed me around, and I’ve never had the slightest inclination to go through them. Then last week, in a fit of January decluttering fervour, I decided to reclaim my closet. Everything came out into the living room, where it seemed to me an achievable aim to aggregate these six crates down into a single container. I could probably do it in an hour, I thought. Four days later and here I still am: surrounded by papers, trying to weigh the value of a letter from my mother’s then 17-year-old brother to her in 1967, and whether I should keep receipts from my tax return in 1998.  How do people do this? Decide what to keep and what to junk? I come from a long line of hoarders. But, even so, the situation I confront with these six crates is ridiculous. Birthday cards from people I haven’t spoken to in years. Random newspaper cuttings clipped for me by my mother: Helene Hanff’s obituary; a review of a play about Van Gogh from 2002 that has been sitting unread in my closet for 20 years. Cuttings I kept myself, for “historical reasons”: the front page of the Independent when Diana died; bizarrely, Louise Woodward on the cover of the Mirror (the headline was “Stitched Up”). From May 1997, “Blair’s Britain is born.” All pointless, yet poignant with age. The further down I go, the weirder it gets. A receipt for fertility drugs for $1,776 – which I kept out of sheer incredulity, having rocked up at the cash desk of the pharmacist in 2014 thinking I’d be on the hook for no more than $29.99. Down, down I go. My mother’s record-keeping was meticulous and, from this historical distance, exhausting. In one folder, my school reports going back to nursery. (As a three-year-old in 1979, I can inform you, I was “making good progress but inclined to be rather tense” – nothing changes.) It gets worse. At the bottom of the third crate, job references from my mother’s employer for a bookkeeping position she held for a year at the South African Mining Journal, in 1956. (She was, I read, “an intelligent, cheerful and satisfactory worker”.) Everyone in this last exchange is dead. There are a few treasures. Photocopies of letters written to Iris Birtwistle by her old friend Muriel Spark – which Iris, I now recall, gave to me 20 years ago to spite Spark’s biographer. From 7 August 1950 – in Spark’s long, looping hand: “August Bank Holiday and all it implies finds us both somewhat weary, having no garden & park…” A silver dollar from 1865, which I discover, thanks to the internet, is worth $30, $3,000 or nothing at all. Some share certificates leave me excited, before I remember I sold the associated shares six years ago. Ah, shit. And then, towards the bottom of the third crate, the honking great memorial candle given to me by Amersham crematorium after my mother’s funeral in 2003. I’ve been lugging it between addresses ever since. Even at the time, I remember thinking, what am I supposed to do with this? Put it in the window? It’s enormous and has her name on it. I call my children out from their room. “Look,” I say. “This is your dead granny’s memorial candle. We can’t throw it away, so we’ll light it.”“Why would you want to throw it away?” says a child, boggling.“Because it’s ugly.”“That’s rude.” We light it. Seven-year-olds regard the past differently: as more mythical and simultaneously more porous. Candle lit, one daughter chats to it, fetching her most precious items to hold up and show to her dead granny. A sister regards her critically. “Why are you talking to her? It’s not like she turned into a candle.” A letter from the IRS from 10 years ago letting me off a huge penalty; definite keep. An untitled poem, given to me by a friend, by Tahar Djaout (“Silence is death / If you speak, you die / If you are silent, you die / So speak, and die”): keep. Ticket stub from the Empire State Building from 1999: bin. I am so servile that anything looking vaguely official goes into the “keep” pile, which means the Insight Into Industry “certificate of achievement”, issued by my high school for the momentous achievement of going on a year 11 trip to Aylesbury sewage works, will be my children’s to treasure in perpetuity. Ugh, the letters. So many letters. From my mother’s seven siblings, none of whom, at the time of her death, she had seen for more than 25 years, feverishly keeping up appearances until the end. “Won’t you visit? We’d love to see you.” “Maybe next year; won’t you please consider it?” On and on it goes. Five crates are returned to the closet. After four days, I’ve managed to whittle things down by only a single container. And I am one step closer towards my dream of owning a shredder.

1/21/2022,"All pub grub is not built the same. Some is sublime, worth booking ahead for and travelling miles to get to; some is the reheated or deep-fried contents of various freezer bags and flung at plates. My job – and it is a real job – is to decipher what goes in which category. Take the Victoria at Oxshott in Surrey, for example: newly refurbished and reopened, and with Fat Duck alumni at the helm, which feels instinctively like the sort of place you should force your partner to change into trousers for.  Charles and I frequently lock horns whenever we set off somewhere like this, which claims to be a pub but in fact serves “pan-fried” stone bass with keta caviar and smoked confit duck with pistachio. “But it’s a pub,” he’ll say, casting a hand over his designer track pants. “No,” I’ll reply. “They do wagyu bavette and rib-eye with bordelaise sauce. It’s trousers, proper trousers.” And off he’ll trudge back to the wardrobe in the manner of a man forced to complete the London marathon in a 140lb vintage deep-sea diving suit.That isn’t to say the Victoria specifies any sort of official dress code; rather that some places just exude a certain level of genteel correctness. The dining room is rather dreamily staged, like an olde English inn with the light blueprint of a pricy West End brasserie, all cosily furnished, with burgundy panelling, low beams and an open fire. Chef director Matt Larcombe was once head chef at The Crown at Bray, and met manager Simon King when both worked for Heston Blumenthal. There’s a bar area for locals and an extensive regular wine list that starts with house white, a grenache blanc, at £25, as well as a “rare wine menu” from which, if you’re really making a night of it, you can blow £9,750 on a bottle of 1997 Screaming Eagle cabernet sauvignon from the Napa Valley. See? I told you it’s a proper trousers type of place. I’ve knocked booze on the head for the time being, leading to a life of shrubs, kombuchas and seltzers, so they made me a “Light and Firey” with Lyre’s alcohol-free cane spirit and ginger (think dark’n’stormy, but without the morning-after clouds). We sat close to the blazing log fire as two thickly beer-battered oysters were brought to our table, perched back in their shells along with a puddle of pale green, seaweed-infused mayonnaise. If you’re someone who thinks they can’t face oysters, deep-frying the slimy blighters really does help, I assure you. Beautifully presented pickled cucumbers arrive with a mildly seasoned homemade gentleman’s relish, after which we share a plate of sweet, almost al dente salt-baked beetroot that’s even prettier than the cucumbers. Food doesn’t need to be a beauty contest, but it takes real skill to take a dowdy beetroot, then peel it, smoke it, pickle it, salt-bake it, top it with curd and scatter it with hazelnuts, and end up with something that wouldn’t look out of place on an afternoon tea cake-stand at the Ritz. There’s a fish and chips main course option at £19, as well as that Trenchmore Farm bavette at the same price, feasibly to stop the locals from rioting, but then prices hurtle upwards rather dramatically, and at a rate that might leave anyone picking up the family’s dinner bill in need of a lie-down in a darkened room afterwards. Beef wellington wrapped in light, crisp-yet-moist puff pastry with a rich, herby duxelles inner casing, for instance, came at a memorable £45 a slice. Chips, of the triple-cooked, stubby genre, were a fiver on top. Now, it must be said that this was almost certainly the finest beef wellington I will eat in this lifetime, filled with a chunk of rare beef similar in texture to chocolate truffle, but it’s rare that I leave a restaurant wondering if we should perhaps have saved a few pennies by going for the whole turbot with red wine and kale to share at £85. I know all too well, however, that restaurants – sorry, I of course mean pubs – such as this are astonishingly expensive to keep afloat. At least four different smart, cheery front-of-house staff served our table, and the desserts are made by the sort of imaginative patisserie wizard who takes the concept of the Snickers bar and reimagines it as a large square of soft, sweet, nutty mousse with chunks of aerated chocolate and an oozing, caramel centre. This is a very, very good pudding, and I doubt I’ll eat many finer things this year. We also tried a banoffee pie at £9, too, but it paled into insignificance in comparison. The Victoria at Oxshott is a very decent, semi-formal destination restaurant hiding in plain sight inside a village pub near Leatherhead. I’m certain the £40 Sunday lunch here would be an outstanding experience, particularly for a special occasion. No jacket required, but if you ask me … well, I’m still insisting on trousers.  The Victoria High Street, Oxshott, Surrey, 01372 238308. Open Weds-Sun, lunch noon-2.30pm (3pm Fri & Sat; 4pm Sun), dinner 6-9pm (last orders; 10pm Fri & Sat).

1/21/2022,"Eddie Howe again declined to address Saudi Arabia’s dismal human rights record as he confirmed he would take his struggling Newcastle squad to the Gulf kingdom after Saturday’s game at Leeds. Saudi-owned Newcastle are due to fly to Jeddah on Sunday for a week-long warm-weather training camp on the Red Sea coast, where thermometers reached 30C on Friday. Although Howe revealed they were likely to play a friendly he refused to say whether he would meet Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler. “I don’t know any of those details at the moment,” he said.  The political temperature has been raised significantly by human rights issues and the Saudi regime’s alleged involvement in the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in 2018 but Howe maintained he was concentrating purely on football and Newcastle’s attempt “to survive in the Premier League”. Newcastle’s manager, whose side sit second bottom after winning only one game, said: “It’s a football decision. We’re doing it for the benefit of the players in our fight to stay in the division and that’s my only thought. The facilities and everything around the trip are going to be first class and the players will be very well looked after. “There will be no distraction from my side. It’s about the training and making sure the players are focused on our next game [against Everton on 8 February]. We’re just doing it in a different environment to bring the players closer together. We’ll try to do some good work and come back as a united squad. “Going away is vitally important. A lot of the Covid protocols you have around the training ground [in England] are encouraging isolation, quite rightly to protect everybody. But it doesn’t help you foster the team spirit and the togetherness that we’re going to need in the battle to stay in the division. It’s important to encourage that unity so going away together is a great idea.” Saudi’s Public Investment Fund holds an 80% in Newcastle and Amnesty International is concerned about the trip. “It could turn into another PR opportunity for the Saudi authorities who are trying to sportswash their appalling human rights record,” a spokesperson said. Howe, meanwhile, conceded he had experienced a frustrating week in the transfer market as he endeavours to reinforce his squad, with moves for the Sevilla centre-half Diego Carlos and the Manchester United forward Jesse Lingard faltering. “We are desperately trying to improve the squad,” he said. “But it has been a fruitless search this week.”",Sport/Football,Eddie Howe says Newcastle making Saudi trip ‘for benefit of the players’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/21/eddie-howe-says-newcastle-making-saudi-trip-for-benefit-of-the-players
1/21/2022,"In the pandemic’s darkest days, when our horizons were largely limited to the four walls of our house and the very notion of attending a ‘gig’ seemed completely preposterous, something amazing happened. Across the music industry, artists and bands dug out their webcams (or high quality recording equipment), ushering in the age of the livestreamed gig. Some of these performances were strikingly professional – mammoth pyrotechnic happenings beamed from cavernous super-clubs – while others were endearingly homespun, putting the ‘bedroom’ into bedroom pop. But they all shared an admirable desire to put on a show in trying times.  Still, I think I’m finally ready to admit, nearly two years into the ‘age of the live stream gig’, that pretty much all of those performances left me somewhat cold. No shade cast on the performers, who were busting a gut as per. It was simply that, without the thrum of the crowd, the atmosphere frequently felt funereal. It reminded me of the days of Top of the Pops, when a band like U2 couldn’t (or wouldn’t) make it to the studio and would instead play a sterile, audience-less beamed in from LA. It would invariably fall flat, not least when followed by footage of people pogo-ing around to Aqua or someone similarly naff back in the studio. At the same time, I recognise that this is perhaps a churlish position to take. There are plenty of people who can’t make it back to live performances, who are well-served by live streams. There are fans halfway across the world, unlikely to get the chance to see a band live, who are well-served by live streams. There was the music industry itself, which was given a valuable leg-up by live streams at a desperate time. Clearly live streams are a good thing – even if they’re not as good as the real thing. The heartening news, then, is that the return of actual gigs with actual audiences hasn’t killed off the live stream era. Instead, it has enhanced it. Next weekend Jonny Greenwood and Thom Yorke’s new band The Smile play their first ever performances in front of fans (seated and in the round) at a small venue in London. Unsurprisingly it’s a sellout, but Radiohead superfans can at least have the consolation of catching the performances over live stream at home. Or they can go and watch them at a local venue in the UK or the US. This of course is nothing new – globe-straddling, chart-topping artists have been livestreaming performances for a decade or so now. The difference is that, where once the tools of such performances were only available to those at the top of the tree, now they’re accessible to smaller artists too, thanks to canny companies like Hotel Radio, who broadcast gigs from punk, hardcore and metal bands to every corner of the globe. And, in contrast to the old days of getting fleeced by dubious promoters, artists are taking their fair share from these streams thanks to a host of ethical companies. The era of livestreaming has much to offer. I’m all for it – as long as it doesn’t involve me watching someone playing acoustic guitar from a box room.

1/21/2022,"Peloton is considering workforce cuts and production changes as investors hammered its share price after a report said it was considering halting the manufacture of its exercise bikes because of a slump in demand. The company’s chief executive, John Foley, said a report by CNBC claiming that it plans to temporarily halt production of its exercise bike and treadmill products was “incomplete, out of context, and not reflective of Peloton’s strategy”.  However, Foley said in the message to Peloton’s 3,200 staff that the company needed to “evaluate” the size of its workforce and indicated that production curbs are on the way as he referred to “resetting” manufacturing. The CNBC report cites internal company documents and Foley said in a blogpost published on Thursday that “we have identified a leaker, and we are moving forward with the appropriate legal action”. He added: “In the past, we’ve said layoffs would be the absolute last lever we would ever hope to pull. However, we now need to evaluate our organisation structure and size of our team, with the utmost care and compassion.” Describing the halting of all production of bikes and treadmills as “false”, Foley then said the company would be “resetting” production levels, acknowledging that there had been a surge in demand for Peloton equipment when Covid lockdowns were introduced at the start of the pandemic. The easing of restrictions around the world, however, has shifted exercise habits back to gyms and outdoor activity. This week the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced the lifting of work from home guidance – a big driver of demand for at-home exercise equipment – in England. “We feel good about right-sizing our production, and, as we evolve to more seasonal demand curves, we are resetting our production levels for sustainable growth,” said Foley. Peloton’s shares fell 24% on Thursday following the CNBC report, which said the company plans to pause bike production from February to March and its Tread treadmill machine for six weeks from next month. CNBC cited a 10 January presentation in which the company said it was facing a “significant reduction” in demand around the world as a result of price sensitivity – its bikes start at £1,350 in the UK – and increased competition. Peloton had said on Thursday that it was taking “significant corrective actions” to improve its profitability and estimated second-quarter revenue to be about $1.14bn (£840m), compared with its previous forecast of $1.1bn to $1.2bn. “During the pandemic, there was too little supply to meet the growing demand. Unfortunately, the company took those cues to bulk up supply just as demand began to falter,” said Simeon Siegel, analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Peloton has been working with consulting firm McKinsey & Co for a review of its cost structure and could cut jobs, CNBC reported earlier this week.",News/Business,Peloton hints at cuts after report on fall in demand for exercise bikes,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/21/peloton-hints-at-cuts-after-report-on-fall-in-demand-for-exercise-bikes
1/21/2022,"Norfolk has become the latest area in England to start transferring patients to a hotel in order to free up hospital beds. The Norfolk and Waveney clinical commissioning group (CCG) said the hotel would act as a temporary care facility, after the service declared a critical incident this month due to “sustained and unprecedented pressure”.  The pilot “care hotel” in central Norwich will cater for up to 15 patients on a short-term basis for three months and will be used for patients who are ready to leave hospital but need extra support before going home. It is expected to open in the next few weeks. The accommodation will be run by home care company Abicare, which has similar services in other areas of the country, including three hotels in the south of England. Cath Byford, the chief nurse at Norfolk and Waveney CCG, said the pilot would “provide a short-term safe, home-from-home environment for people to move to from hospital when they are well enough but not quite ready to go home without support”. “This will help to speed up the passage of patients through our local hospitals so that we can make more beds available for those who need them most,” she said. “This is the first time we have tried this new approach in Norfolk and Waveney, although the model has been used successfully in other regions.” Anne-Marie Perry, the chief executive of Abicare, said care hotels “are an excellent example of a proactive short-term solution that can be readily set up as they are needed utilising resources that exist within the community”. She previously said the severe shortage of domiciliary care workers able to look after people in their own homes is one of the factors behind the need for such services. “The hospitals are on their knees and we are being contacted fairly regularly by clinical commission groups,” she said.",News/Society,‘Care hotel’ set up in Norwich to relieve ‘unprecedented’ pressure on hospitals,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/21/care-hotel-set-up-in-norwich-to-relieve-unprecedented-pressure-on-hospitals
1/21/2022,"Good morning. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell has provoked anger after he appeared to imply that African Americans were not Americans in remarks about Black voters.  Speaking to reporters after Republicans once again blocked the Democrats’ voting rights legislation, McConnell said: “The concern is misplaced, because if you look at the statistics, African American voters are voting in just as high a percentage as Americans.” Studies suggest that voting restrictions disproportionately obstruct people of colour. Several Democrats called out the comments, which quickly went viral online, with Democratic Illinois congressman Bobby Rush tweeting: “African Americans ARE Americans. #MitchPlease.” Meanwhile, Malcolm Kenyatta, a Democratic Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, described McConnell’s remarks as a “dogwhistle”. What would the bill have done? Banned partisan gerrymandering, protected election officials from partisan interference, required early voting and same-day registration, and restored the pre-clearance provision central to the Voting Rights Act. It comes amid unprecedented concern over the future of US democracy, with one in three Americans believing Joe Biden was not legitimately elected. The US has accused Russia of recruiting Ukrainian government officials in order to take over the Kyiv government. Imposing sanctions on four – two Ukrainian members of parliament and two former officials – on Thursday, the US accused Russian intelligence of mounting a conspiracy against the government of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “Russia has directed its intelligence services to recruit current and former Ukrainian government officials to prepare to take over the government of Ukraine and to control Ukraine’s critical infrastructure with an occupying Russian force,” the Treasury statement accompanying the sanctions said. Russian troops have arrived in the town of Yelsk in Belarus and other areas near Ukraine’s border, local media reports, as part of joint military exercises set to begin next month. What has Joe Biden said? The president said: “If any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion. Let there be no doubt if Putin makes this choice, Russia will pay a heavy price.” What sanctions would be imposed? There is disagreement within Nato, with Germany refusing to send arms to Ukraine. There is also dispute in Europe about whether Russia can be cut off from Swift, the international payments system. Ivanka Trump, the daughter of the former president, has been asked to cooperate with the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack. Trump, who has been asked to appear for a voluntary deposition, is the first member of the former president’s family who has been called upon. Along with her husband, Jared Kushner, she was a senior adviser to her father during his presidency. The development comes after the US supreme court rejected Donald Trump’s request to prevent the release of more than 700 highly sensitive White House documents. What does the panel want to ask her about? The former president’s plan to stop the certification, and his response to the Capitol attack. The questions will be aimed at whether he presided over a criminal conspiracy involving obstructing a congressional proceeding. Meanwhile, the prosecutor for Georgia’s biggest county on Thursday requested a special grand jury with subpoena power to support her investigation into the former president’s attempts to interfere with the state’s election results. Dozens of people are feared dead after an explosion caused by a truck carrying mining explosives colliding with a motorbike in western Ghana. The explosion, which destroyed hundreds of buildings, happened around midday in Apiate, near the mining city of Bogoso. The US singer and actor Meat Loaf, born Marvin Lee Aday, has died aged 74, his agent has confirmed. No cause of death was shared. AirTags – small wireless tracking tools – have been used to stalk individuals, police across the US have said. Apple, which manufactures the devices intended for tracking lost belongings like luggage, has said it will cooperate with police and is “committed to AirTags’ privacy and security”. There were a total of 5,981 unruly passenger reports last year, according to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, 4,290 of which were categorized as “mask-related incidents”. In a dramatic example of how the issue persists in 2022, a maskless “disruptive customer” forced an American Airlines flight en route to London to return to Miami on Wednesday. In 1959, Sonny Rollins was already one of the undisputed giants of the bebop style of jazz at 28. But despite his fame and critical acclaim, Rollins felt a sense of dissatisfaction with his playing, which led him to drop off the radar. Rather than playing to packed rooms of fans, for two years the saxophonist chose instead to tell his “multitude of stories to the sky”, playing on the Williamsburg Bridge for up to 15 hours a day. Now 91, Rollins speaks about the “spiritual” experience on the 60th anniversary of his return to the recording studio. This week’s “You be the judge” has all the hallmarks of a classic family grudge: longstanding resentment; unbalanced levels of effort; sibling rivalry. While older sister, Elsie, buys her Ollie designer shirts and AirPods, he sends her “a cheap supermarket card with the sticker still on” (Elsie’s words).

1/21/2022,"Just before you reach Chimbote, a seaside city 260 miles (420km) north of the Peruvian capital Lima, you can smell it. It’s like the whiff of a fishmonger’s stall on a hot afternoon. For Peruvians, it’s synonymous with a bad pong; “smells like Chimbote” means something stinks. Once that scent was “the smell of money”, according to another popular expression. A natural superabundance of Peruvian anchovy – known locally as anchoveta – off its Pacific coast makes Peru the world’s biggest producer of fishmeal, a condensed powder or cake made from ground dried fish.  The country exported a staggering $1.54bn (£1.13bn) in fishmeal processed into animal feed and pellets in 2019 and $420m of fish oil. A recent Guardian investigation that revealed many fish oil products on western supermarket shelves are rancid has been blamed on the fish oil industry’s vast supply chain – with fish caught in Peru, processed in China and shipped to European and American supermarkets. Chimbote has been the first link in this multimillion-dollar chain since the 1950s. But after many decades, Chimbote residents are reevaluating their role in this industry – one they say is not only harming their health and wellbeing, but is damaging the very ocean itself. About 20cm long when mature, the little anchovy has been a gamechanger not only for the Peruvian economy but also for the global fishmeal industry. Oily and rich in protein, it is said to be the most heavily exploited fish in the world’s history and is preferred for high-quality fishmeal and fish oil. About 4.8m tonnes of anchoveta was caught in 2020, according to Peru’s national fishery society (SNP), which represents the sector. Most of the catch – about 98% – is processed into fishmeal: about 1m tonnes of fishmeal and 171,000 tonnes of fish oil by up to 42 companies operating in Chimbote. Eleven of the largest firms are affiliated with the SNP, which says all is well, not just with the industry but with the health of the fish on which it depends. “There hasn’t been concern about overfishing for more than 30 years, as a result of the fishery management plan, which seeks the sustainability of the ecosystem and the fishing industry,” says Cayetana Aljovín, SNP’s president. She says quotas allow a catch of just 35% of the fish’s adult population, leaving the rest to reproduce. But in Chimbote the picture does not look so rosy. The many factories in the south of town produce constant smell, noise and soot from the chimneys. Residents claim the fishmeal processing plants are making them sick. “The smell is nauseating, the vibrations from the factories break the walls of our homes,” says Lizzety Avila, 58, a community leader in the 15 de Abril neighbourhood, where only a brick wall and a road separate the chimney stacks belching fumes from their self-built brick houses. “Year after year, we’ve been fighting these factories,” she says over the whirring and grinding noise emanating from a nearby plant. “We’ve got people with pulmonary fibrosis, bedridden. We have neighbours who have died of cancer. These factories belong to multimillion-dollar companies and they only think about their profits, not about our quality of life, how we suffer living with this pollution.” In the adjoining Trapezio neighbourhood, baker Liz Estrada, 45, says soot from the plants’ chimneys coats the walls of their homes, the washing and gets into the food. “Many people in the area are dying of cancer. The children are sick. We had a school here, and the parents had to withdraw the children because the pollution was tremendous,” says Estrada. The Guardian could not independently verify claims that the pollution had caused cancer, but residents’ claims that a higher than normal number of children were suffering from allergies, respiratory problems and dermatitis were echoed by paediatrician, Dr Lorenzo Rodriguez, who has run a surgery in the city for 16 years. “In the hotspots, where there is a lot of fishmeal processing in Trapezio and 15 de Abril, in previous years I had suggested [to the parents] that they should move their children,” Rodriguez says. “I said: ‘Your children are becoming more asthmatic, you shouldn’t stay there.’ That’s directly caused by these irresponsible companies who don’t look beyond their wallets. “Sadly, the regulatory bodies, the health ministry and the companies – who should collaborate so that the people see that they are not just merely desperate for money – are not doing their part. The state is not playing an active role … and it’s letting this happen,” he said. The SNP, which represents at least eight of the country’s top fishmeal producers, denies there is a rise in respiratory complaints among children indicating that health ministry figures show Ancash, the region where Chimbote is located, is below the national average for such illnesses. It added that the companies in Chimbote had invested $166m (£122m) in recent years to modernise their factories to reduce emissions and to move them away from residential areas. But the impact of the industry is visible everywhere you look. Once at the heart of a region known as the “Pearl of the Pacific”, Chimbote was a major source for guano, the fertiliser made from seabird excrement which powered Peru’s 19th-century economy. Today, the city’s seafront overlooks the Isla Blanca, stained white by centuries of guano – but the cormorants and pelicans are scarcer, and the bay itself, though full of fishing vessels, is no longer teeming with life. Effluent from the factories has polluted this once-pristine coastline for decades, says Romulo Loayza, a biology professor at the National University of Santa in Nuevo Chimbote. On a boat trip into the bay, Loayza uses a small dredger attached to a rope to scoop up foul-smelling sludge from the seabed. “There is virtually no oxygen in this mud. You can see there’s no life,” he said, squishing the dark brown slime between his fingers. “This is organic waste from the factories.” There are about 54 cubic metres of sludge coating the bay’s bottom – in some parts more than a metre thick, according to a 2003 study by Peru’s marine institute, Imarpe. The SNP says most of the sediment comes from El Niño events that have flooded the river, which feeds into the bay. Dozens of piers to individual factories line the bay. Before 2015, lax regulations allowed untreated waste to flow directly into the water. Now a 10km pipeline pumps it into deeper water, but nothing is being done to dispose of the existing waste. Meanwhile, fishers say that the biggest impact of the fishmeal industry is that it’s sucking up all the fish – leaving none for them. In Coishco, one of many nearby fishing villages, the brightly painted boats are pulled up on the white sand – an idyllic-seeming image, but the result of the fishers being forced to find other work. “What affects us most is the scarcity of the resource,” says Edmundo Aparicio, 67, who grew up in the village and recalls a time when fish was so plentiful it was often given away on the beach. “We used to be able to provide for our families, and most importantly, put food on the table for the ordinary folk. Now the fish is scarce, the price goes up, and what we sell in the market goes to restaurants we can’t afford to eat at,” he says. They are also angry with the big fishmeal companies for not treating them properly, they claim. Fishers in Chimbote formed a union 65 years ago. Today, its secretary general, Macedonio Vásquez, alleges that during the first wave of Covid-19 infections the companies brought fishers to work at sea after just one week’s quarantine in a hotel, in violation of the country’s restrictions at the time. Peru has one of the world’s highest death rates from Covid-19 per capita. “The companies did not take the precautions to protect the fishermen,” says Vásquez. “In the hotels, there were many infections which were not taken care of by the companies. The hospitals were saturated.” “Companions died, many died, but the deaths were not attributed to Covid-19 according to the death certificates.” The SNP denied this stating at the time that “the industry adopted provisions beyond what it was legally required to in order to safeguard the health of its employees”. It added the union was forced to retract its allegations after being threatened with legal action. Even if the industry did start to address the concerns of overfishing, pollution and poor labour management, Chimbote’s fishmeal industry could be hit by another problem. Global heating is raising concern about the long-term sustainability of the Peruvian anchovy. Peruvian scientist Renato Salvateci predicted in Science magazine that anchoveta could disappear from the country’s seas due to warming temperatures caused by the climate crisis. If that happens, Chimbote will be left with nothing more to show for its many decades of exploitation other than a polluted bay, empty fish factories and the white stain of the guano industry.",News/Environment,The smell of money: why locals think Peru’s billion-dollar fishmeal sector stinks,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/21/the-smell-of-money-why-locals-think-perus-billion-dollar-fishmeal-sector-stinks
1/21/2022,"Sex, desire and libido are things that change and evolve over time for most adults, with those in long-term relationships especially liable to these ebbs and flows. For some couples, a sex life which both partners find satisfying can be one of the first things to fall by the wayside when everyday stresses, distractions and routines start to take over. Here, Anjula Mutanda, a psychotherapist, relationship psychologist and president of relationship support charity Relate, advises how couples of all ages, genders and sexualities can stop life getting in the way of sex, and reconnect intimately.  Don’t try to recapture the old daysMany couples fall into the trap of thinking they must recreate romantic situations they had in the early days of their relationship to “get the magic back”. But I think that’s a self-defeating coping mechanism as you’re trying to go back to your chemical romance, that obsessive love when things were exciting because they were new; and when you don’t get that you feel like you’ve somehow failed. Your relationship is now deeper, more subtle, layered and experienced, you’re familiar with what you’ve got. Perhaps you have kids, a mortgage, or jobs you worry about – through these things you have experience and togetherness, which you can build real intimacy and affection on. Everything is foreplayThere are lots of different ways to improve connection and they don’t all start in the bedroom. Relationship expert Dr John Gottman said that “everything is foreplay”. It’s all about the touching, hugging, smiling at your partner, eye contact, giving them a kiss before work. These are all connectors that will lead to mood boosts and more closeness in the bedroom. We get trapped into neglecting the smaller moments of affection and thinking that we have to get a date in the diary to have sex, or that we need to book a restaurant like in the early days. But if you do that then you jump ahead of time and forget to consider all the small acts of intimacy that can really rebuild your connection. Lube can enhance the sexual experience for everyoneThere are a number of things that can make sex uncomfortable and not pleasurable. For instance, vaginal dryness, which can be caused by age, medications, menopause, hormonal changes at times in the menstrual cycle and anything that can impact you physiologically. Using Kynect (the new name for KY Jelly) can really help to increase physical connection and pleasure. Unfortunately, many people are in the mindset that if they need to buy something that should occur naturally they are somehow lacking, which leads to nervousness around talking about and asking for lube. I’d advise seeing lube as a purely positive enhancement, a product that makes things feel better. Even if you’re not experiencing any physical problems, Kynect is a great addition to your sex repertoire. I think that as a nation we really need to reframe our thinking around using something that’s there to support and increase pleasure, there shouldn’t be any shame or embarrassment, we should be proud to be able to walk into a shop and buy a product that will help us have a better sex life. Understand each other’s love languagesRelationships are very much the dance of give and take, so it’s key to understand the love language your partner is speaking and appreciate them for it. For instance, their love languages might be doing things for you, or asking about your day. Yours might be lots of penetrative sex and if you want more of that from your partner, it’s good to start it from a positive place. For instance, saying: “I love it when you do this” and “Thank you for doing that”, can lead to a supportive conversation in which your partner feels valued and seen, and can help come to a compromise for both of you. Listening to what each other wants can really take the pressure off. Be ‘good selfish’It’s easy to get stuck in the rut of worrying about how long it’s been since you had sex with your partner and feeling pressure to pleasure them; but it helps to ask yourself if you’re looking after your own needs. Masturbation is a great way to get to know yourself and take a step towards building things back with your partner. There’s such a thing as being good selfish, and showing yourself some self love can result in you showing your partner what you like. Not enough people talk about masturbation, but it’s something that really matters. Get out of your own headPeople can get really stressed out by thinking about having sex so much they don’t want to do it. To stop getting too in your head about it, try some relaxation techniques that put you in a good positive headspace, like listening to relaxing music. Going for a walk together is a helpful way to relax, and holding hands while you do it is a form of creating intimacy. Touch helps you bond and feel closer, and studies show that it signals safety and security, so this could lead to having sex later in the day or that week. It’s also found that sexual activity prevents increases in blood pressure, so thinking about the health benefit can be motivation to get into the bedroom too!
