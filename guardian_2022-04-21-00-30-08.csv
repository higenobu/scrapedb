4/21/2022,"The Bank of England is asking lenders and insurers to pay an extra £24m so it can hire 100 extra staff and keep track of new risks, including those linked to crypto assets. The central bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which is in charge of managing systemic risks across the financial sector, said it was expanding its 1,341-strong workforce in response to “new policy responsibilities” that also included setting the UK’s own rules after Brexit. Sam Woods, a deputy governor and head of the PRA, said the Bank was trying to keep up with “innovation and emerging risks” including the boom in crypto assets, which an international watchdog has said could pose a serious threat to financial stability if regulators failed to take action. The Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, also urged banks and other financial firms in December to be “especially cautious” when dealing with crypto assets such as bitcoin until new regulations are in force. “In order to deliver an expanded role as a rulemaker and an increased focus on operational resilience, we will need to increase our resources this year with a budget that will allow us to employ around 100 more staff than last year’s budget,” said Woods. He said the PRA also needed to monitor “ongoing digitalisation” of financial services, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as other developments in fintech. “This includes our work to manage the risks to firms’ safety and soundness from climate change,” he added. The PRA said its wider remit would require raising the annual levy for the 1,500 firms it supervises, as it planned to increase its annual budget by by about £24m to £320.9m, a 9% rise. However, Woods said the regulator may struggle to attract candidates for its workforce expansion.

4/21/2022,"It is a familiar post-match scene. The manager sits up on a little stage, the press down in front of him, and attempts to explain it all away, to make his excuses. And so there we were at Anfield on Tuesday night, in the aftermath of Manchester United’s 4-0 hiding by Liverpool, a result that begged many questions, including whether it had been more or less humiliating for the visitors than the previous instalment. That was last October, when Liverpool won 5-0 at Old Trafford. How had it happened again? The club is “obviously in a difficult situation”, came the response, a line that touched on United’s myriad problems, taking in the fan fury towards the ownership and even some of the players, the lack of joined-up thinking, the dismal form, a selection crisis. “Look at the lineup tonight,” he continued, before pointing out that the central midfielders Scott McTominay and Fred were among those missing because of injury. Well, McTominay was on the substitutes’ bench but he was not able to come on. “McTominay was only here to show up. I don’t think he was ready.” When it rains, it pours and Paul Pogba would be forced off in the 10th minute with a calf strain. In the 5-0, the midfielder had been sent off 15 minutes after his introduction as a half-time substitute. “When you are already in a difficult situation, very often in life you get another knock and that’s what [happened] … In the game, Paul has to go off.” At least, there was a note of optimism about the future. “I know it will not last for ever,” he said. United, he added, “will strike back … be there again. The club is too powerful.” The words there, ladies and gentleman, not of the United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, but of his Liverpool counterpart, Jürgen Klopp. Rangnick, for the record, would go hard in the opposite direction, criticising his players for the dreadful defending on the opening goal, scored by Luis Díaz in the fifth minute, and various other mistakes, such as playing loose passes into the jaws of the Liverpool press, which is what happened for the third goal, finished off by Sadio Mané on 68 minutes. Rangnick said it had been “extremely embarrassing”. If we are looking for an indictment on where United find themselves, which is at the lowest ebb for decades, then being on the receiving end of sympathy from the Liverpool manager – pity, even – is surely the most damning. It is possible that Klopp trod carefully because of the respect he has for Rangnick, his fellow German, the so-called Godfather of the Gegenpress, who has influenced his own approach. Klopp, who had been overtly non-inflammatory before the game when asked about United’s situation, would talk in glowing terms about Rangnick’s tactical switch at half-time from a back five to a system that was either 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1, depending on where you had the attacking midfielder, Jesse Lingard, who had come on for Pogba. “We had to adjust to the different high-press system, lineup, organisation of the opponent,” Klopp said. “It’s really difficult. They take off [Phil] Jones and bring [Jadon] Sancho. The pressing is different. You are just used to specific spaces from the first half and then, OK, that doesn’t work any more. We didn’t start moving immediately again. We didn’t drop in the right [moments] and, all of a sudden, we cannot pass the balls through.” The weird thing was that for 20 minutes or so, United looked vaguely comfortable and the home crowd started to betray a bit of anxiety. After the first-half procession, there was finally a note of tension about English football’s classic game. So all hail Rangnick, the tactical genius? Hardly. After how badly he got it wrong at the start. It quickly passed because Liverpool adapted, found a way back through the lines and when Mané made it 3-0 it was the prompt for a powerful last quarter from them – and for United to wilt. Again. For Klopp to be well placed to show his magnanimous side. And for United to be reduced to a trawl through the thinnest of gruel for anything that might have gone right. These kind of morsels are all they seem to have at present. Where Klopp solves problems and has a clear vision, Rangnick cannot escape them or align his players with how he wants to play. Which is not a huge surprise. Rangnick is a manager who likes intensity, non-stop running without the ball; to win it back high up, to use the counter-press as a tool to attack and defend. He also favours a longer-term rebuilding project. So what better than to give him this squad and a six-month deal? Still, it will soon be time for that sweet, sweet consultancy gig. Nobody seems quite clear about what this will entail but, certainly, he will be on the mobile if needed. Rangnick said that Bruno Fernandes, who had already been in one car crash this week, was forthright with his views in the dressing room at Anfield and the question concerns whether United can somehow rouse themselves at Arsenal on Saturday. The club were horrified to learn that their Old Trafford fixture against Chelsea has been rearranged for next Thursday, meaning a third big game in nine days, potentially undermining their fight for a top-four finish. Never mind that they could have freed themselves from such worry by, say, beating Watford at home or not slumping at Everton. It will not matter when they face Thomas Tuchel’s side if they were to lose again on Saturday.",Sport/Football,Klopp’s show of pity is a damning sign of Manchester United’s plight | David Hytner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/jurgen-klopp-show-of-pity-is-a-damning-sign-of-manchester-united-plight-liverpool
4/21/2022,"Germany’s foreign minister has insisted there is “no taboo” in Berlin over sending armoured vehicles to Ukraine, as her government defends itself against criticism that its delay in authorising the delivery of heavy weapons is undermining the west’s unified stance. Berlin has not ruled out shipping tanks to Ukraine, “even if it may sound like that in the German debate”, said Annalena Baerbock at a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian foreign minister, Edgars Rinkēvičs. However, as the German army has run out of military hardware it can dispatch swiftly without undermining its own security commitments, the Green politician said her government had agreed instead a swap system whereby it would help refill the gaps in the arsenal of Nato and G7 states that are in a position to help Ukraine more quickly. “We support partners that can deliver weapons quickly and guarantee replacements,” said Baerbock at the start of her three-day tour of the Baltic states. At a press conference on Tuesday evening, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, confirmed that his government was planning to support Kyiv with cash rather than by sending tanks or armoured vehicles from its own stocks. “We have asked the German arms industry to tell us which material it can deliver in the short term,” Scholz said. “Ukraine has now made a selection from this list and we will provide it with the required money for the purchase.” The list of materials included anti-tank weapons, anti-airplane systems and munition “that could be used in artillery battle”, he said. The Ukrainian government has complained that Scholz’s list does not include the kind of heavy weapons that would allow its forces to mount a counter-offensive against Russian troops in the Donbas region, such as the Panzerhaubitze 2000 artillery system. Ukraine’s ambassador in Berlin, Andrij Melnyk, said on Tuesday night that Scholz’s lack of direct material support had been received in Kyiv “with great disappointment and bitterness”. After Russia’s invasion of its easterly neighbour on 27 February, Scholz announced an “epochal change” in Germany’s stance on weapons exports and military spending. But critics in Europe and at home say the Social Democrat chancellor has failed to follow up on his grand announcements with the firm steps required to send a message to the Kremlin and to reassure Nato allies that Germany has departed from its policy of rapprochement. Berlin has already blocked European requests for an immediate embargo on Russian energy imports, saying it would not be able to wean itself off Russian oil until the end of the year and Russian gas until mid-2024 without destabilising its economy. Tuesday’s speech seemed designed to assure a domestic audience that Germany’s three-party coalition government was acting in unison with its western partners. “Germany going alone would be wrong,” Scholz said. “Those who are in a comparable situation to us are acting the same.” However, this week several other Nato states communicated in clearer terms than Germany that they are willing to send heavy weapons to Ukraine. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, announced on Tuesday that the Netherlands would ship heavy equipment, including armoured vehicles, while a US Pentagon official said on Monday that the first parts of its $800m (£613m) tranche of helicopters, howitzers and Humvees had already arrived on Ukrainian soil. Baerbock said on Wednesday that Germany had in the past chosen not to make public all the weapons it has sent to support Ukraine, adding that the government could help Kyiv maintain more advanced weapons systems and train soldiers to use them. “We have delivered anti-tank missiles, Stingers and other things that we have never spoken about publicly, so these deliveries could happen quickly,” she said. Germany was in a better position to support Ukraine’s defensive effort in the long run rather than the short term, Baerbock said. “It is about the next three months, and the next three years. This is where Germany can contribute more.”",News/World news,German foreign minister defends delay in sending armoured vehicles to Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/german-foreign-minister-defends-delay-in-sending-armoured-vehicles-to-ukraine
4/21/2022,"A letter from Joe Biden to Sir Bill Beaumont, chairman of World Rugby, was part of a finalised World Cup package submitted by USA Rugby in its bid to host the men’s event in 2031 and the women two years later. World Rugby is due to announce the success or not of the US bid on 12 May. Alan Gilpin, chief executive of the governing body, has said World Rugby believes it “can deliver the right outcomes with this hosting plan”. In his letter to Beaumont, Biden wrote: “The United States strongly supports the effort to bring the 2031 Menʼs Rugby World Cup Tournament and the 2033 Womenʼs Rugby World Cup Tournament to our country and looks forward to working with Rugby World Cup Limited to help deliver the most successful Rugby World Cups in history”. The president also pledged “to promote the development of rugby in the United States and worldwide in a sustainable and humanitarian manner, without any discrimination whatsoever, regardless of race, nationality or creed”, and says the US government will work to ensure that “any adverse impacts on the environment as a result of the tournaments are minimised”. Biden said governmental guarantees sought by World Rugby would be “executed by officials who have the competence and authority” to do so, or in co-operation with states and private entities. The US will also seek the enactment of any necessary legislation, the letter says. Biden’s Democrats stand to lose control of Congress to Republicans this November. There is however a bipartisan Congressional Rugby Caucus which supports the World Cup bid. In the formal letter, Biden does not mention his own rugby experience as a player at law school and as a fan, notably of Ireland. The president has often expressed his love for the game and recently hosted a White House visit from the former Ireland and Lions full-back Rob Kearney, a cousin. After Kearney’s visit, when Biden’s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, made his own White House visit, a signed rugby ball was visible in the Oval Office. In a tweet, Kearney shared a picture of himself giving Biden the ball before “kicking practice in the garden”. I spy a rugby ball in the Oval Office 👀 pic.twitter.com/UymjnGnzV9 In statements accompanying the release of Biden’s letter, Jim Brown, the chair of the USA Rugby World Cup bid, said: “We are honoured and humbled that President Biden shares our optimism not only about hosting upcoming Rugby World Cups in the United States, but also about the vast potential the sport has in this country. “The support of federal, state and local governments is fundamental to the successful planning and execution of a world-class event and this strong endorsement by the president marks a huge step forward in our plans to host incredible Rugby World Cup tournaments in the United States in 2031 and 2033.” Ross Young, the chief executive of USA Rugby, said: “We now optimistically look forward to World Rugbyʼs final decision in less than a month. The potential to grow the sport of rugby in the United States is truly immense, and weʼre all excitedly awaiting next steps should the US be awarded the opportunity to host.” No other host will be announced for the men’s event in 2031, should the US not succeed. Australia is set to be named host for 2027. The next men’s tournament is in France next year. The US have not yet qualified, needing to beat Chile this summer. The next women’s World Cup kicks-off in New Zealand in October. On Wednesday, USA Rugby also released a list of cities pursuing hosting rights for Rugby World Cup games. Other cities could be used. The cities listed were: Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Birmingham, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Nashville, New York/New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Diego, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle and Washington DC. Washington – or in fact Landover, Maryland, home of the Commanders NFL team – hosted the US Eagles men’s team last October. A showpiece game against New Zealand ended in defeat by 104-14 but attracted a crowd of around 40,000. Bid materials sent to World Rugby alongside the Biden letter, the US bid said, include “a preliminary budget structure, comprehensive data on the candidate host cities and stadiums [and] an initial rugby development and legacy proposal to elevate growth across all levels of the game in the United States”.",Sport/Sport,Joe Biden supports US Rugby World Cup bid in letter to Bill Beaumont,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/20/joe-biden-us-rugby-world-cup-bid-letter-bill-beaumont
4/21/2022,"National parks and other protected areas have had mixed success in conserving wildlife, according to the largest ever global study of their effects. Using wetland bird data from 1,506 protected areas around the world, scientists analysed the trends of more than 27,000 populations, and found that increased provision for the birds had not necessarily helped. Researchers said the study, published today in the journal Nature, has important implications for the movement to protect 30% of the Earth for wildlife by the end of the decade. The results show that managing parks to protect species and their habitats is crucial, and that without such management parks are more likely to be ineffective. “We know that protected areas can prevent habitat loss, especially in terms of stopping deforestation,” said lead author Dr Hannah Wauchope of the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at Exeter University. “However, we have much less understanding of how protected areas help wildlife. Our study shows that, while many protected areas are working well, many others are failing to have a positive effect. “We need more focus on ensuring areas are well-managed to benefit biodiversity.” Governments are currently negotiating this decade’s targets to protect biodiversity, with dozens of countries signing up to a target to protect 30% of land and sea by 2030. While this study only looked at waterbirds, scientists said their abundance, ability to colonise and leave locations quickly, and the quality of data meant they were a good proxy for other wildlife. Scientists compared waterbird population trends before protected areas were established with trends afterwards in 68 countries, and also analysed the trends of similar waterbird populations inside and outside protected areas. Much of the data was collected by volunteers. “We are not saying protected areas don’t work,” Wauchope said. “The key point is that their impacts vary hugely, and the biggest thing this depends on is whether they are managed with species in mind – we can’t just expect protected areas to work without appropriate management. “It also appears that larger protected areas tend to be better than smaller ones.” Co-author Julia Jones, a professor at Bangor University, said: “There are big pushes backed by the likes of Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson and others to expand protected areas to cover 30% of the planet by 2030. But it’s really important to know if these protected areas actually deliver or not. “There are very few studies that look at whether protected areas effectively slow species declines or improve populations. It seems quite basic but the reason for that is, it’s actually really difficult to do.” She added: “This analysis gives really useful indications of how conservation can be improved to deliver better outcomes for species.” Thomas Brooks, chief scientist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, who was not involved with the research, said waterbirds were a good example of a group facing the consequences of human behaviours that drive biodiversity loss. “Waterbirds are extremely widely distributed. They move around the whole time, are highly migratory, breed at high latitudes, in Arctic tundra, wetlands, all the way through the rest of the world. “They face lots of pressures at different stages in their lifecycles, including the impacts of unsustainable harvest and climate change,” he said. He added that the study had important implications for conservation management.

4/21/2022,"Evgeny Lebedev’s nomination for a peerage was paused after advice from MI5 and was only ultimately approved with a letter advising his appointment would be controversial, the chair of House of Lords appointments commission has told MPs. Giving evidence on Wednesday morning, Lord Bew said that MI5 had raised security concerns when the Evening Standard owner was put forward for a peerage by Downing Street in March 2020 – which prompted “a protracted period” of review. Bew did not spell out what those concerns were to MPs on the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, but it is understood that the agencies had initially flagged up that Lebedev’s father, Alexander, was a former KGB agent, prompting the commission to press for further details. The commission, Bew said, had received advice that “required further elucidation”, a process that he admitted “went on for some weeks”. He added: “Does that constitute a pause? I suppose so.” Controversy surrounding the peerage given to Lebedev dates back his appointment in 2020. Sources have said that the commission felt “bounced” into appointing him because Downing Street continued to press for it despite the initial MI5 warning. The Russian-British dual national is a friend of the prime minister, whom he has regularly invited to his Christmas and summer parties in London and at his palazzo in Umbria, Italy. The morning after one such party, Johnson was spotted at a nearby airport looking like “he had slept in his clothes”. Bew indicated to MPs that while MI5 had provided additional security advice about the newspaper owner, it did not merit calling for the appointment to be blocked. “No pressure” was applied by Downing Street to endorse Lebedev’s peerage, Bew added. However, the commission chair said that the final letter endorsing Lebedev’s nomination contained a pointed observation about how the prospective appointment was likely to be received if Downing Street pushed ahead. “We do say about candidates, there are things in this person’s career which will lead to negative public comment,” Bew told MPs, although he added this did not amount to a warning. A “reasonable person” might conclude that had happened in Lebedev’s case, he said. Labour has successfully demanded that the commission publish the security advice the commission received by 28 April, after reports in the Guardian, Byline Times and the Sunday Times about the security concerns raised by MI5. Bew said there was “a final document” summarising the issues relating to Lebedev’s nomination, but added it was not yet decided “what’s to be released and what’s not to be released” – implying there was an ongoing process of redactions. At the time of the Commons vote to disclose the security advice, Lebedev said he had “nothing to hide” and called for the security advice about him to be made public. After warning about Lebedev’s father, MI5 is understood to have told the commission that any security risk associated with the Evening Standard owner would be low, because peers do not routinely see classified government documents.",News/Media,Evgeny Lebedev’s nomination for peerage ‘paused’ after MI5 advice,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/20/evgeny-lebedev-nomination-for-peerage-paused-after-mi5-advice
4/21/2022,"It would be lazy and unoriginal to state that Fulham’s win over Preston on Tuesday guaranteed their relegation from next season’s Premier League, so needless to say that is exactly what The Fiver will do. When push comes to shove, if they can’t be bothered doing anything more interesting than yo-yoing down from the top flight to the Championship and back up again season after season after season after season after season after season, we’re darned if we can be bothered to come up with any new, increasingly condescending gags about the almost psychotic lengths they and Norwich City will go to in order to avoid ever having to play each other again. “WE ARE PREMIER LEAGUE!” chanted Fulham’s ecstatic players and fans at Craven Cottage, a refrain they previously sung in 2018 and 2020, only to sink like Boris Johnson’s approval rating upon reaching the promised land. This time around, however, things could be different because – Fiver pulls sarcasm lever – it’s not as if their current crop of players such as Tom Cairney, Tim Ream, Aleksandar Mitrovic and Tosin Aderabioyo – not to mention manager Marco Silva – have been tainted by relegation from the Premier League. “It feels fantastic to get this club back where it belongs,” cheered Silva, presumably referring to that strange Nowheresville Limbo where they have secured promotion but not yet officially swapped their licence with a certain outfit from Carrow Road. “It will be a huge challenge for us but we have to do the right things to prepare. When you achieve something so important early in the season, that gives you time to prepare in the right way and we have to do that.” In Mitrovic, Fulham have a striker who has scored 40 Championship goals this season, a fine achievement that has prompted some armchair critics to flag up the derisory three the Serbian international scored in the top flight last season and label him a flat-track-bully. While Mitrovic could rightly point out that he was knacked for large periods, there are valid concerns that his glacier-like turn of foot might once again prove a hindrance next season. So while recent history suggests Fulham will be odds-on for the drop, they can at least console themselves with the fact that there are 20 teams in the top division and they only have to be better than three of them. And if the risible rabble representing Manchester United are currently sixth in the self-appointed Best League In The World™, Silva could be forgiven for wondering exactly how difficult that can be.

4/21/2022,"Shares of Netflix lost more than 35% of their value in New York on Wednesday morning, after the streaming giant announced it had lost more than 200,000 subscribers in the first three months of the year and said it and expects to lose 2 million more over the next quarter. The sharp drop in value – the largest for the service in over a decade – comes as subscribers rethink their commitment to streaming services that grew their numbers sharply during the homebound months of peak lockdown. Netflix had anticipated it would add 2.5 million customers in the first quarter. A number of rival services, including Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount, often with deeper content libraries to draw on, have also entered the market. Netflix stock, which was already down 40% for the year, has now dropped from $700 in November to $244 when the market opened, a fall approaching two-thirds. The company said on Tuesday that it had experienced “revenue growth headwinds”. It recently raised subscription prices despite signs that consumer growth was slowing, with a basic monthly package now costing US customers $15.49. “We’re definitely feeling higher levels of market penetration … and heightened competition,” said Ted Sarandos, co-chief executive. In terms of capitalization, Netflix is now worth $109bn, a figure that will make it more difficult for its Los Gatos, California-based management to raise money to fund the investment for content production upon which subscriber growth has been dependent. The confluence of negative forces, from the lifting of the pandemic, the loss of 700,000 subscribers in Russia, high consumer inflation in many leading markets forcing households to rethink their budgets, have hit the service. Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO currently making a hostile takeover bid for Twitter, claimed “woke mind virus” is behind Netflix’s stock plunge – not competition, password crackdowns or an inflation squeeze. “The woke mind virus is making Netflix unwatchable,” Musk tweeted. Wednesday’s crash comes after a period of spectacular growth for the company coupled with investors demand for the stock. Netflix, like Peloton and GameStop, was a beneficiary of cash that flushed through economies during the pandemic, feeding demand for stocks. Shares of Netflix rose 86% from the end of 2019 through 2021, while the S&P 500 climbed 48%. Reed Hastings, co-chief executive, said tackling account sharing is now a priority for the company. An estimated 100m households are using accounts that they do not pay for. “When we were growing fast it was not a high priority, but now we’re working super hard on it,” Hastings said. The company also said it would attempt to jump-start growth by improving the “quality of our programming” and consider introducing a lower-price, advertiser-supported subscription option. “I’ve been against the complexity of advertising and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,” Hastings said on Tuesday. “But as much as I’m a fan of that, I’m a bigger fan of consumer choice.” “Nobody was expecting Netflix to announce they lost subscribers. They were expecting a slowdown in subscriptions, but seeing Netflix losing subscribers is a big deal,” Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, an online broker, told the Wall Street Journal. “People are asking ‘Is this worth it?’” Ozkardeskaya said. “As prices rise, the worth threshold is being pulled higher and that’s pushing people to the exit.”",News/Media," Netflix shares fall more than 35% after streamer loses over 200,000 subscribers",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/20/netflix-shares-fall-losing-subscribers
4/21/2022,"The government has quashed a review into the right to roam in England’s countryside, amid anger from campaigners that the law of trespass stops people from walking freely around the country. It was revealed last year that the Treasury had commissioned Lord Agnew to lead a review into access to nature, asking respondents for “radical, joined up thinking” to achieve a “quantum shift in how our society supports people to access and engage with the outdoors”. But now, the government has said the review has been wound up, and it will not be releasing any results. This means there are fears that the right to roam over the 92% of England’s land that is privately owned and not available to access will not be realised. Currently the Countryside and Rights of Way (CRoW) Act 2000 gives a legal right of public access to mountains, moorland, heaths, some downland and commons, alongside the more recently created England coast path. Campaigners have asked for this to be extended to cover rivers, woods and green belt land. 97% of rivers are currently off-limits to the public, and tens of thousands of acres of woodland have benefited from public subsidy, yet remain publicly inaccessible. The environment minister Rebecca Pow said in response to a question from Labour’s Alex Sobel: “The Access to the Outdoors Commission was a cross-government process designed to inform the spending review on how to increase access to green spaces. There are no plans to release the review in a consolidated way. Rather the results of the review are now incorporated in the spending review which is providing more than £30m to improve public access to green spaces in support of health, wellbeing, and the environment.” Countryside groups have asked the minister to reconsider, and run a review into whether the countryside and rights of way act could be extended. Guy Shrubsole, an author and co-founder of the Right to Roam campaign, said: “Access to nature is vital to everyone’s physical and mental health, yet we have a right to roam over only 8% of England – the law of trespass still reigns over the other 92%. “The government ought to be championing increased access to the countryside by extending our right to roam to include rivers, woods and green belt land. “Instead, ministers have squashed what could have been a groundbreaking review of access rights, seemingly bowing to landed interests. But they’re on the wrong side of history – the public want greater access to nature and will win in the end.” Tom Fyans, the director of campaigns and policy at CPRE, the countryside charity, added: “To quash efforts aimed at improving access including the right to roam in this manner sends the wrong message. To ensure a healthy future for the countryside it should be available for everyone to enjoy. “Unfortunately, there is a sliding scale of injustice when it comes to who has access to nature. We need to urgently open up our green belts, which are the countryside next door for 30 million people. For those in towns and cities it’s vital we increase the number of local green spaces, particularly when they are targeted at the most nature deprived communities. “The most urgent need is in economically deprived areas in the north, where the poorest in society often don’t have easy access to our national parks and sometimes don’t even have a local park to enjoy the benefits of nature on their doorstep.”",News/UK news,Fears over right to roam in England as ministers wind up review,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/20/fears-over-right-to-roam-in-england-as-ministers-wind-up-review
