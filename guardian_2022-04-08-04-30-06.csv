4/8/2022,"Akshata Murthy is richer than the Queen and owns almost as many houses. The Indian heiress, and her husband, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, own a property portfolio of four homes worth an estimated £15m – including an LA penthouse overlooking the beach where Baywatch was filmed. The couple, who married in a lavish two-day Indian ceremony in 2009 and have two children, live predominantly in a flat above 10 Downing Street but also own two other properties in the capital and a £2m Grade II-listed Georgian mansion in Yorkshire. Murty, 42, is sitting on an estimated £690m fortune held in shares in Infosys, the IT giant founded by her billionaire father. That makes her much richer than the Queen, who has about £365m. It was revealed this week that despite living in the UK for the past nine years, Murty claims non-domicile status, allowing her to avoid paying UK tax on the £11.5m-a-year she collects in dividend from the overseas IT fortune. Using the “non-dom” scheme – which is also used by the now-sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and the Daily Mail owner, Lord Rothermere – has allowed Murty to not pay up an estimated £20m in tax that would have been due on £54m of dividends earned over the past seven-and-a-half years if she decided to pay UK tax in full. Her spokesperson suggested that Murty, as an Indian citizen, had no choice but to be “treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes”. However, all UK residents must actively apply for non-dom status by filing in government tax form SA109 to claim the tax relief. Murty is also paying a £30,000 “annual charge” to the Treasury for the right to maintain her non-dom status beyond a seven-year cut off period. The non-domicile scheme, first introduced under King George III in 1799, is legal and can be used to avoid paying UK tax on income from overseas rents and bank interest as well as foreign dividends and inheritance tax. Non-doms can live in the UK all year round. The UK’s tax rules are set by Murty’s husband, the chancellor. In his spring statement last month, Sunak raised the tax burden on UK taxpayers to its highest level since the 1940s, even as the population faces the biggest squeeze on living standards on record. The Resolution Foundation thinktank suggested Sunak’s package of measures would push 1.3 million people, including 500,000 children, into poverty. Before they moved into Downing Street – when Sunak was appointed chancellor in 2020 – their main residence was a five-bedroom mews house in Kensington. The property, which they bought in 2010 for a reported £4.5m, is now estimated by estate agents to be worth more than £7m. They also own a flat on the nearby Old Brompton Road, which is said to be used by family and friends when they come to visit. In the picturesque North Yorkshire village of Kirby Sigston, the couple own a Grade II-listed Georgian manor house estimated to be worth £2m. The house, which they bought for £1.5m before Sunak became MP for the Richmond (Yorks) constituency, is undergoing a £250,000 development to add an indoor swimming pool, hot tub, tennis club and gym complex. Both Murty and Sunak are fitness fanatics, who have spoken of dawn workouts before work every day. The couple were last year granted planning permission for a single storey L-shaped building in a paddock beside the lake at their Yorkshire home set in 12 acres near Northallerton. The building project includes a 40ft by 16ft indoor pool, changing area, hot tub and dance room with a mirrored wall. The building is to be clad with local stone and topped with a Welsh slate roof to make it appear like “a stone-built ancillary building that has undergone renovation and modification”. However at the planning meeting last year, the councillor John Noone said: “It doesn’t look like an agricultural building to me, it looks like a rather large bungalow. I think it does actually have an impact on the setting of the Grade II manor house. When we went on the site visit you could clearly see the manor house from where we were stood.” In California, where Murty and Sunak met, she owns a $7.2m (£5.5m) penthouse apartment that boasts sweeping views of the world-famous Santa Monica pier and the Pacific Ocean beyond. Estate agents for the six-storey building, built in 2013, boast that the penthouse comes with “large private outdoor terraces unlike anything ever seen before on Ocean Avenue”. Residents of the Waverly complex on Ocean Avenue are promised “the epitome of urban Santa Monica beach living” with “stunning views of the Santa Monica mountain”, where you “wake up to the sound of waves crashing against the shore”. The building, designed by KTGY architects and with interiors by the LA designers Marmol Radziner, offers an around-the-clock concierge and a fitness centre “stocked with the latest equipment for those looking to improve their cardiovascular or muscular endurance”. There is even a “pet spa” where residents’ “furry companions can get pampered”. Murty, who was born in India, spent most of her late-teens and 20s in LA. She went to the city’s private liberal Claremont McKenna College, where she studied economics and French, before moving to the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising. She worked for Deloitte and Unilever before studying for an MBA at Stanford University. It was at Stanford that she met Sunak, who had won a prestigious Fulbright scholarship. Within four years, they were married in a two-day ceremony in Bengaluru, attended by cricketing royalty including the Indian spinner Anil Kumble and the family of Rahul Dravid, the former captain of the national cricket team. Her father, NR Narayana Murthy, the billionaire founder of Infosys, said he was a “little sad and jealous” when Akshata first told him of her new life partner. “But when I met Rishi and found him to be all that you had described him to be – brilliant, handsome and, most importantly, honest – I understood why you let your heart be stolen.” As well as the Infosys stake, the couple also own London-based Catamaran Ventures UK, which invests in startups “with the view to future capital growth and income distributions”. Sunak transferred his shares to her just before entering parliament, and she is now the sole owner. She has held direct stakes in at least six other UK companies, including the gentlemen’s outfitters New & Lingwood, which measures Etonians for their tailcoats and sells silk dressing gowns for £2,500 each. Murtyhas also held shares in a UK business that operates Jamie Oliver’s Pizzeria, Jamie’s Italian and Wendy’s outlets in India, the nanny agency Koru Kids, and the gym operator Digme Fitness, where she is a director. Both New & Lingwood and Digme furloughed staff during the pandemic. Soroco, a software company co-founded by her brother, lists Murty as a director of its UK arm.",News/Politics,"The wealth of Akshata Murty, Indian heiress and wife of Rishi Sunak",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/07/the-wealth-of-akshata-murty-indian-heiress-and-wife-of-rishi-sunak
4/8/2022,"The reasons to watch and to question The Girl from Plainville, an eight-part Hulu mini-series based on the infamous “texting suicide” case from mid-2010s Massachusetts, are both contained in the final scene of the first episode. The camera hovers behind Michelle Carter, played mesmerizingly by Elle Fanning, who stares at herself in the mirror, face distorted by grief. It’s summer 2014, a few weeks after Conrad “Coco” Roy III (Colton Ryan), with whom Carter had a years-long text-based relationship, killed himself via carbon monoxide poisoning in a K-mart parking lot. Michelle appears to be practicing a speech for his memorial. “I loved him, and he loved me, and he loved all of you guys. I know he did,” she says through tears. But then the tears abruptly stop. Michelle turns around to her laptop to restart a scene from Glee in which Rachel Berry, played by Lea Michele, sings a tribute to Finn Hudson, the character played by Michele’s on and off-screen boyfriend, Cory Monteith, who died of an accidental overdose in 2013. Michelle’s heartfelt words are actually, we realize, merely heartfelt mimicry; her monologue is lifted near-verbatim from Glee. Michelle follows Lea Michele’s monologue to the end of the scene, singing To Make You Feel My Love with operatic gestures, voice raw. It’s a fascinatingly circular, deeply uncomfortable scene: a teenage character obsessed with a famous TV character inspired by tragic real-life events – a disturbing, weird detail lifted from the real-life Michelle Carter story – played for provocation on a TV show assumedly aimed to sketch in the blanks of a well-publicized, polarizing tragedy. There’s a lot here. Is Michelle a psychopath looking for sympathy? A delusional narcissist? An unwell teenage girl so devoid of self-worth that she psychotically over-identifies with a fictional character? Someone deeply moved by television? You could find evidence for any of those readings. The moment is The Girl from Plainville at its best: an exploration of the human behind a seemingly monstrous act (Carter was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in a precedent-setting case in 2017 for telling Roy, in several text messages for weeks before his death, to kill himself). It’s also indicative of the fundamental awkwardness of this show, an overlong deluge of unease which gestures at a lot of thorny, circular issues but barely digs into the mess of the real story. Some of this discomfort – the mysterious, bizarre darkness of abnormal psychology, the power of digital communications to warp one’s sense of reality, too-strong identifications with celebrities – feels earned, suggestive, rich. But a lot of it stems from the show’s premise, in making what is fundamentally entertainment out of the deeply tragic digital union of two very wounded, very fragile teenagers. The Girl from Plainville, as a recent true crime series, continually begs the question for its justification – what does this add to a story we already know? Can entertainment illuminate without exploiting? – and doesn’t seem to know the answer. The Girl from Plainville, created by Liz Hannah and Patrick Macmanus, exists at the intersection of several popular TV sub-genres. It’s another example of a 2010s headline turned popular documentary/podcast/exposé turned limited series – a narrative second draft of history, as in The Dropout, WeCrashed, Super Pumped and Inventing Anna. (The Girl from Plainville is based on an Esquire article on the real trial, which is also the subject of the 2019 two-part HBO documentary I Love You, Now Die, directed by Erin Lee Carr.) It’s interested in the psychology of chronic lies, such as in the aforementioned true-scam shows, HBO’s Winning Time (on a business level) and Hulu’s The Act (about an infamous 2010s Munchausen-by-proxy story, also explored in Carr’s first documentary, Mommy Dead and Dearest). It offers a complicating, if not redemptive, character study of a publicly villainized woman, a la Pam & Tommy, Impeachment: American Crime Story or documentaries on Britney Spears, Janet Jackson and Lorena Bobbitt. There’s the interest in teen mental health and suicide, as in the controversial Netflix hit 13 Reasons Why and the moral panic over HBO’s hit Euphoria. In The Girl from Plainville and most of the aforementioned shows, there’s also the evergreen and uncanny frisson of seeing a well-known actor transform through hair, makeup, costume and prosthetics into a well-known figure. In other words, much of what The Girl from Plainville is doing is familiar, on a thematic and narrative level; it employs some well-worn prestige TV tropes for better (an interest in the brittle grief of Coco’s mom Lynn, played wonderfully by Chloe Sevigny; meticulous costuming and set design that captures the vibe of suburban 2012-2014) and for worse (muddled multiple timelines, a lagging eight-hour runtime that could’ve been four). The show is most novel and intriguing in its attempt to convey the emotional realism of consistent texting. In the first three episodes – the immediate aftermath of Coco’s suicide on one timeline, and the initiation of their relationship on a Florida vacation on the other – the phone screen is a haunting presence. Michelle hovers over hers with near-religious fervor, typing and retyping and staring at messages; Lynn’s grief is patterned by texts and calls; Coco buries his chronic depression and loneliness into his phone. By the fourth episode, which dropped last week (the remaining four will air weekly), Coco and Michelle are deep in their secret correspondence – nebulous, toxic, psychoactive. The couple, who only met in person a handful of times, were less lovers than voices in each other’s heads. The show captures some of that blurriness, and why adults just didn’t get it, by putting the texts in the actors’ mouths. Their digital conversations (pulled, it seems, from the real texts) play out as fantasy sequences, one imagining the other in the room with them, staring ravenously at them, as they type. But we barely get to feel it, as the spliced timeline undercuts their exchanges. A fourth episode scene in which Coco tells Michelle that he attempted suicide, for example, cuts to a standard procedural scene in which the prosecutor mulls over zero-sum strategy for how to best pursue Michelle at trial. It’s a frustrating watch; the show’s quality, particularly Fanning and Ryan’s instinctive performances, masks the shallowness of too many ideas, not enough clarity. The first half of the season mostly keeps Michelle a cipher, perhaps necessary for a person who has never participated in a formal interview since her 2015 indictment and did not speak at trial, but an ultimately uncomfortable decision. The intentional, interesting discomfort – reconciling what Michelle said with the vulnerable character on-screen – quickly elides with discomfort over the whole project. Michelle Carter was 17 years old when this all happened. There’s a version of this story that is even more sympathetic to her, a girl who long struggled with eating disorders and anxiety (suggested but not overt in early episodes) who also experienced suicidal ideation as a teen. How much creative license is fair with these real stories? Which truth gets the most bearing? Does audience or truth matter more? These are all messy questions without easy answers, and I say that as someone who will watch the whole series. It’s fitting, I suppose, for an incredibly messy story; the deeper you go – and with all the coverage of the trial, its thousands of pages of text message records, you can go very deep – the messier it gets. Yet you can somehow watch The Girl from Plainville and forget how tragic this whole story is, which is maybe the most uneasy thing of all.

4/8/2022,"If the County Championship season started with its traditional squelch, a surprising number of batters were able to see off April’s demons. At Edgbaston, where the wind snapped across the ground like a bad-tempered terrier, terrorising the glove-wearing umpire and billowing the covers, Surrey made steady progress against the reigning county champions, Warwickshire, despite the frequent weather interruptions. Ryan Patel, opening the innings, galloped along to 75 before having a wild swing at Olly Hannon-Dalby, while Ashes flotsam Rory Burns chugged along to a steady 41 in an opening partnership of 117. Hashim Amla was also misled by Hannon-Dalby, stumps-a-splatter for two, and Ollie Pope caressed a quick 40 before stumps. At Chelmsford, old hands Alastair Cook and Nick Browne made the most of a friendly pitch, putting on 220 for the first wicket and each reaching a century as Kent’s bowlers toiled into the swirling gale. Australian Jackson Bird, on debut, dismissed them both in fairly quick succession before Dan Lawrence shouldered arms to a ball that nipped back. Stevie Eskinazi made the first Championship hundred of the year, and his first at Lord’s in five years, in a classy innings of 118 as Middlesex ambled along confidently against a wan and depleted Derbyshire attack. Josh de Caires, Michael Atherton’s 19-year-old son, collected his maiden first-class 50 in an innings of careful cribbage. Derbyshire’s cause was not helped when Ryan Sidebottom, their new signing, limped off the field after 1.1 overs with a suspected hamstring problem. At Hove, Sussex’s rosy-cheeked apple scrumpers, with an average age only just over 21, made sublime progress against big boys Nottinghamshire. Fifties for Ali Orr and Tom Haines, the captain, and 82 not out from Tom Clark frustrated a bowling attack hobbled by injury. Liam Patterson-White, who bowled unchanged for 30 overs from the sea end, the breeze kissing his left shoulder, was the pick with three for 69. Apocalyptic hail thwarted progress at Cardiff, where 71 from Colin Ingram kept Glamorgan steady against Durham. Chris Rushworth trapped an enterprising Sam Northeast lbw on his club debut for 24. There were, though, some batting sides who hadn’t read the memo. Somerset were bowled out for 180 after electing to bat against Mohammad Abbas and co, with only James Hildreth passing 30. Hildreth, in the last year of his contract, played sweetly for 87. Hampshire were 109 without loss at stumps. Ben Sanderson took four for 38 to put Northamptonshire on top in the battle of the promotion class of 2019. Only James Bracey, 77 not out, seriously disturbed the scoreboard as Gloucestershire finished 164 for eight. And Worcestershire’s in-out day against Leicestershire was spoiled by Chris Wright’s three for 33, with Azhar Ali run out for two on his club debut.",Sport/Sport,County Championship: Essex’s Cook and Browne ruffle Kent on opening day,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/07/county-championship-round-up-cook-and-browne-ruffle-kent-bowlers
4/8/2022,"John Cameron Mitchell’s grunge musical is the strangest of shows. It combines the kind of high-camp monologue you’d expect at a cabaret club – all knowing narcissism and arch innuendo – with a set of authentically scuzzy rock songs that recall the sounds of a 90s basement dive. Neither has much to do with the other. Dating from 1998, the show prefigures the gig-theatre wave of the last decade and yet exists in its own self-referential universe, too sketchy for narrative engagement, too meandering for emotional impact. In 2022, some aspects seem stranger still. Maybe we can accept Hedwig’s origins in communist East Berlin, but the jokes about Manhattan districts and US middle-of-the-road bands are from another place and time. And yet this high-class production by Jamie Fletcher shows it is in keeping with our gender-fluid age. When Divina De Campo makes her look-at-me entrance as Hedwig from the back of the theatre, milking the audience for applause, she is dressed in a stars-and-stripes cape that opens up to reveal the slogan “gender is a construct”. It’s safe to say that she and her excellent four-piece band, plus Elijah Ferreira as husband, Yitzhak, are happily unconstructed. Hedwig presents herself as the missing link between east and west, top and bottom, male and female, an antidote to binary divisions, as she makes her way from Europe to the US, Lotte Lenya accent intact. De Campo has more than just drag queen swagger; she matches her stage presence with an effortless vocal range, bringing resonance and subtlety to Stephen Trask’s songs. Those songs are an amalgam of rock, funk, boogie-woogie and punk, showing the influences of everyone from Iggy Pop to REM, and expertly performed under the musical direction of Alex Beetschen. Accompanied by Daniel Denton’s colourful video designs, they are the pulsing bedrock of the show. For all the talent on display, the show’s appeal passes me by today as much as it did on its original run in New York. Don’t take my word for it – the audience laps it up with gusto – but I can’t think of a show that leaves me so unsure of the joke or so puzzled about what it is trying to say.

4/8/2022,"Britain is preparing to announce a fresh package of military aid for Ukraine and has demonstrated new missile systems and armoured vehicles that it believes can help Kyiv in the next phases of fighting. Junior defence ministers Jeremy Quin and James Heappey invited Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Volodymyr Havrylov to Salisbury Plain on Wednesday, where they discussed what extra weapons the UK could supply. “It was an honour to show Minister Havrylov and his generals the kit the UK hopes to provide next and to discuss some new weapons that have been trialled recently with UK forces,” Heappey said. The army and Royal Marines demonstrated a range of equipment and “options for further military support”, which, the Ministry of Defence said, included “defensive missile systems and protected mobility vehicles”. The protected mobility vehicle is thought to refer to the Mastiff, a heavily armoured patrol vehicle, first deployed in Afghanistan, which would help Ukraine’s forces achieve greater manoeuvrability against Russian attacks in the eastern Donbas. It is less certain what artillery could be provided, although there has been speculation that the UK could offer the AS-90 howitzer, which has a range of nearly 15 miles and would help Ukraine’s forces contend with Russian shelling. Either would be a modest step up from the 4,200-plus NLAW anti-tank bazookas and the Starstreak anti-aircraft systems the UK has already sent to Ukraine, described by the UK as “defensive weaponry” designed to prevent the Russians from swiftly conquering the country. One source said that Downing Street was likely to make an announcement on the next steps for military aid before the end of the week. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, met Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday afternoon, where the issue was discussed. “Both leaders agreed that the west needed to accelerate its support to Ukraine in the coming days and go further and faster with the equipment it was supplying,” said Downing Street after the meeting. Western countries have begun pledging a fresh wave of military aid after Russia’s initial attack on Kyiv was repulsed, recognising that the conflict had moved to a new phase in which Ukraine is trying to prevent Moscow’s forces advancing in the east and holding on to gains made in the south of the country. A donor conference convened by the UK and attended by more than 35 countries last week hammered out what each state was willing to supply. At the time, Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, said that the best counter to Russia’s artillery was “other long-range artillery”. Some countries have already announced their plans. The US has committed $400m (£300m) of aid in the past week, including the APKWS rockets that can be used from air and land, and 10 Switchblade 600 drones that employ the same missiles used by the Javelin anti-tank weapon. The Czech Republic has committed tens of T-72 Soviet-designed tanks – the first time a Nato country has agreed to such send heavy armour to Ukraine. But it is still only a modest contribution to Kyiv’s war effort.",News/World news,UK to announce fresh military aid package for Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/uk-and-ukrainian-ministers-meet-to-plan-next-round-of-military-aid
4/8/2022,"Two days after Russia began its war in Ukraine, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency accidentally published an article celebrating the country’s lightning-quick victory over Kyiv, crowing that the “period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end”. After a bloody month of war, after the discovery of evidence of war crimes in cities like Bucha and Borodyanka, the language in that same publication has grown even more extreme, containing calls for societal purges and “re-education” that western officials said could provoke further abuses on the ground. “Ukrainianism is an artificial anti-Russian construct that has no civilisational substance of its own, a subordinate element of an extraneous and alien civilisation,” wrote a RIA Novosti columnist earlier this week. The “re-education” of Ukraine could take a generation, he wrote, adding that “besides the highest ranks, a significant number of common people are also guilty of being passive Nazis and Nazi accomplices”. Even the name Ukraine must be erased, the article argued. Views that were once kept to fringe publications in Russia have gone into mainstream outlets and been voiced on primetime TV as the stakes of Russia’s war in Ukraine have risen. Western observers from Ukraine to the United States have grown worried that the language may be encouraging the abuse of civilians by soldiers on the ground. “This is another piece of evidence for a future tribunal against Russian war criminals,” said Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, citing the RIA Novosti article, which caused a major uproar among western officials. One of his aides accused the news agency of calling for the mass murder of Ukrainian civilians. Civilians in Ukraine have reported Russian soldiers citing conspiracy theories about bioweapon labs or telling them they were only here to “cleanse them from the dirt”. “Those sorts of comments are really creating an even more toxic information environment,” a western official said, and could “absolutely contribute” to abuse of civilians in Ukraine. “Responsibility for this, of course lies with the perpetrators of the acts, but it also lies with the Russian leadership,” the official added. Increasingly, Russia’s pundit class has pushed claims that a significant swath of Ukrainian society is under the sway of far-right ideologies, blaming Ukraine’s staunch resistance to the attack on mass psychosis rather than on legitimate anger at the Russian invasion. “To my horror, to my regret, a considerable portion of the Ukrainian people have turned out to be engulfed in the madness of nazism,” said Margarita Simonyan, the head of the RT news network, during a nationally broadcast talkshow on the NTV channel. “That it is on such a massive scale!” Analysts have pointed to the failure of Russia’s war in its early stages, as well as images of protests in cities against Russian occupying forces, for the escalation in Russian rhetoric. Initially Russians believed that “‘de-nazification’ could be completed through regime change and Ukrainians should be liberated,” wrote Greg Yudin, a Russian sociologist, earlier this week. “Obviously, this conception failed when Ukrainians started resisting bravely. A natural conclusion from that: Ukrainians turned out to be deeply infected by nazism.” As Vladimir Putin has called on his officials to push back against the west’s “information war”, claiming reports of atrocities in Bucha were staged, the government line has also grown closer to some of the most extreme opinions in the Russian news. Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian prime minister, earlier this week declared that Ukraine would face the same fate as Nazi Germany, an opinion that closely resembled the one written in the column published by RIA Novosti just days earlier. “It should not be surprising that Ukraine, which has been transformed mentally into the Third Reich … will suffer the same fate,” Medvedev wrote in a message shared on Telegram. “That’s what her fate is, that Ukraine!”",News/World news,Fears genocidal language in Russian media may prompt more war crimes,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/russian-media-coverage-ukraine-genocidal-streak
