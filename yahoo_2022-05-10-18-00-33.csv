5/10/2022,"Big rallies and massive sell-offs have been the theme going into May 2022. With technology stocks — once again — leading us lower, thanks in part to the 10-year note eclipsing 3%, many of the damaged blue chips are looking beyond oversold. In this piece, we'll use TipRanks' Comparison Tool to check out three of them to see which holds the most bounce-back potential for the year ahead. Each firm may have lost its way, but valuations are starting to become absurd. Boeing (BA) Boeing has done nothing but nosedive over the past year. Shares collapsed from around $250 per share to $150 and change per share. The list of problems continues to grow for Boeing, with the abysmal quarterly earnings and an Air Force One deal that has CEO David Calhoun sounding regretful. Former U.S. President Donald Trump's Air Force One deal is haunting Boeing to this day. With operational hiccups delaying deliveries for select aircraft, it seems like nothing can go right for the aircraft maker. Though Calhoun doesn't yet plan to retire, a major shift at the upper level may be required to get Boeing back on the right track. Although Boeing can't seem to get any wind beneath its wings, demand is likely to remain, given the duopolistic market it operates in. With a potential recession underway, Boeing seems like a lost cause. Still, the valuation is severely depressed, and being a member of a duopoly has its perks. Wall Street analysts are standing by Boeing amid its freefall, with a Strong Buy rating and an average BA stock price target of $228, implying 71% upside from current levels. (See BA stock forecast on TipRanks) Intel (INTC) Intel is another company that's lost its way. The once-cherished semi company fell behind in the chip race, and it could struggle to catch up. Though Intel has a new CEO Patrick Gelsinger, and a strategic multi-year plan to regain the lead in chips, questions linger as to whether the firm can execute. The firm could face an uphill battle as it looks to keep pace with Apple, and its M-series line of chips. Intel's 14th-generation Meteor Lake chip is slated to launch in 2023. By then, Apple may have already raised the performance bar. The stakes are high, and investors don't seem to be giving Intel the benefit of the doubt. Why should they? The chip space is fiercely competitive, and the global chip shortage complicates things greatly. Though long-term global chip demand is a positive for chip makers as a whole, one can't help but worry that Intel may have to resort to discounting, given rivals could raise the bar to heights that could prove difficult to reach. Wall Street analysts aren't so convinced with Intel, even after its drop. It has a Hold rating, and an average INTC stock price target of $51.10, implying ~19% upside from current levels. (See INTC stock forecast on TipRanks) AT&T (T) AT&T is an old-time telecom titan that's on the right side of 5G tailwinds. After spinning off its media businesses, management now has the opportunity to revamp growth in wireless. For the first quarter, wireless growth was remarkable. The company is starting to do a lot of things right, and narrowing its focus is an effort that could allow T stock to break out of its funk. Though wireless numbers are gaining traction, the implications of a recession on such growth are less clear. In any case, the company seems like it's ready to continue swimming forward. With media out of the equation, the new AT&T is arguably the best version of itself we've seen in decades. Its investments in next-gen telecom infrastructure will slowly pay meaningful dividends with time. Still, the major question mark with AT&T is its considerable debt load. Even after spinning off the media assets, the company's debt-to-equity ratio is on the high end at over one. As rates rise, so too will AT&T's costs of borrowing, making the telecom scene somewhat less attractive than it used to be. In any case, management continues to execute. Wall Street analysts are mildly optimistic, with a Moderate Buy rating and an average T stock price target of $22.50, implying 15% upside from current levels. (See AT&T stock forecast on TipRanks) Conclusion Blue-chip stocks are feeling the selling pressure these days. The following blue chips may have lost their way, but with plans to regain dominance, the risk/reward may be getting too good to ignore. Of the three, Wall Street analysts are most bullish on Boeing, and the least bullish on Intel. I'm inclined to agree with analysts. Boeing stock seems to be the best of the batch.

5/10/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s a crypto refrain when prices crash precipitously like this: The selloff is washing out the short term-focused non-believers, known as weak hands, strengthening the industry in its wake. Most Read from Bloomberg Marcos Jr. Leads With 61% of Votes Counted: Philippines Update Stocks Sink to 13-Month Low as U.S. Curve Steepens: Markets Wrap Day Trader Army Loses All the Money It Made in Meme-Stock Era Russian Envoy to Poland Hit With Red Paint in War Protest Dictator’s Son Marcos Wins by Landslide in Philippine Vote It’s a glib way to think of all those who had joined the market as Bitcoin’s price rose to an all-time high at the end of last year -- including institutions and small-time at-home investors, many of whom are deeply underwater on their investments now. A measure called MVRV -- which divides market value by the average purchase price -- shows that short-term holders, on average, purchased Bitcoin at around $47,500. Another gauge, called the spent-output-profit ratio (SOPR), indicates those kind of investors are selling at a loss right now, according to an analysis by Genesis Global that uses Glassnode data. And it’s not just those who have held the coin for a few months. More than half of traders who held crypto at the end of 2021 had gotten in that year, crypto-firm Grayscale Investments said at the time. Bitcoin’s average price in 2021 hovered around $47,300. It was near $32,000 on Monday in New York trading. “Absolutely a ton of people are down,” said Stephane Ouellette, chief executive of FRNT Financial Inc. “Anyone who bought BTC for the first time in 2021 is down.” Crypto fans have long argued that digital assets would hold up well during turbulent times. Many had said Bitcoin would prove to be a good inflation hedge thanks to its limited supply. It was also supposed to hold up better amid economic and geopolitical crises because it’s not tied to any government and has no centralized authority. Instead, digital-asset investors are suffering through an environment that’s put a lot of risky assets through the wringer this year. The Federal Reserve and other central banks are raising interest rates to combat inflation just as the economic backdrop is softening. In this environment, Bitcoin, the largest digital asset by market value, has been cut in half since its November record. It’s seen five straight weeks of declines and just one positive day out of the last 11 sessions, including Monday’s. “Cryptocurrencies are risk assets,” said David Spika, president and chief investment officer of GuideStone Capital Management. “‘This should be a good inflation hedge.’ Wrong. It is a speculative asset that is not going to perform well in an environment like this.” During its downfall, Bitcoin has largely moved in tandem with other riskier assets, analysts have noted. Its correlation to tech stocks has been particularly pronounced, with both the coin and the Nasdaq 100 reaching highs in November. The 90-day correlation coefficient of Bitcoin and the tech gauge now stands above 0.68, the highest such reading in Bloomberg data going back to 2010. A coefficient of 1 means the assets are moving in lockstep, while minus-1 would show they’re moving in opposite directions. “Anyone who bought tech stocks over the past year is underwater, too, and I group them together,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. To be sure, short-term investors aren’t all necessarily retail -- a lot of institutional players also started to dabble in crypto in recent years. Still, the crypto craze had caught the eye of a lot of at-home traders who had been stuck at home during the pandemic and who deployed money into a market that went up in 2020 and 2021. In addition, the average purchase price is just that -- an average -- meaning that Bitcoin reaching that level again doesn’t necessitate all those investors break even once more, said Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis. “It’s likely that more will be, since short-term holders are more prone to panic-selling, and so the average purchase price is likely to drop fast,” she said. As to what it would take for Bitcoin to reclaim its old highs is anyones guess. In the meantime, many are projecting that the coin, and other cryptos, will come out on the other end stronger. The shakeout will leave behind long-term HODLers who aren’t scared enough to offload their holdings. Famed investor Marc Cuban thew in his two cents, tweeting that crypto is going through the same lull the early internet went through. Still, the Fed is dead-set on bringing inflation down through a series of interest-rate hikes, and Bitcoin, and other riskier assets, could meander along all year in this tighter-monetary-policy environment. “Bitcoin is under tremendous sell pressure,” said Steven McClurg, CIO at Valkyrie Investments. “Barring an extraordinary event, it wouldn’t surprise me for us touch $25,000 before we start to see some form of stability. That said, we are more likely to see sideways trading through to the fourth quarter than we are to see a rally carry us through the summer.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Major League Soccer Threatens to Replace the NHL as One of the Big Four U.S. Sports China’s Massive Community-Buying Industry Is Collapsing Germany Comes to Grips With Its Hard-Power Role in Europe Business Travel Rebounds as Execs Choose (Real) Face Time Over Zoom Putting an End to Heart Attacks by Editing Human DNA ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•11 hours ago,Bitcoin Washout Is Leaving Mom-and-Pop Buyers Holding the Bag,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-washout-leaving-mom-pop-220000088.html
5/10/2022,"A series of headwinds have inflamed worries lately, as investors try to find a path through geopolitical turmoil and the threat of recession in the mid-term. Worse are the stubborn inflationary pressures, rising prices that show no signs of slowing down. Taken all together, these factors are straining the economy and have pushed the S&P 500 well into correction territory this year, down by 15% so far. All of this has investors moving heavily into defensive stocks. Watching the market conditions for financial firm Morningstar, manager research analyst Ryan Jackson gets down to the bottom line: “Investors want safety, they want security, and they want to go somewhere where they feel like their money is going to be a little more protected, even in a turbulent environment.” When markets and futures are uncertain, and volatility is high, the logical portfolio move is into high-yield dividend payers. These are the classic defensive plays, giving investors a dual path toward returns, from both the share appreciation and the dividend payments. Bearing this in mind, we used the TipRanks’ database to zero-in on two stocks that are showing high dividend yields – on the order of 8% or more. Each stock also holds a Strong Buy consensus rating; let’s see what makes them so attractive to Wall Street’s analysts. Arbor Realty Trust (ABR) First up is Arbor Realty Trust, a mortgage lender working with both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to provide loan funding. The company also offers financing for developers putting up multifamily residences – the type of project that Arbor Realty Trust focuses on. The main part of the company’s business is mortgage lending for apartment projects and commercial properties. Arbor’s business has been solid in recent quarters, and the company beat the EPS forecast in 1Q22 by a wide margin. GAAP EPS came in at 55 cents, compared to the estimate of 45 cents. The company supported that earnings beat with 17% portfolio growth, and $2.83 billion in loan originations. The company’s sound financial results support a high dividend, of 38 cents per common share. This payment, declared early this month, was up 1 cent from the previous quarter, and marked the eighth quarter in a row of sequential dividend increases. The company has bumped up the dividend by 27% over the past two years. At the current level, the dividend payment annualizes to $1.52 and gives a yield of 8.7%. Covering this stock for Piper Sandler, analyst Crispin Love sees plenty of potential for investors to grab onto. He writes: “Given macro uncertainty and volatility in the markets, we are pointing investors to names that can perform best in these uncertain times and we believe Arbor fits the bill given its historical performance, diversified revenue streams, and tailwinds in the multifamily bridge space. Multifamily bridge has been a popular space in recent quarters given strong demand and pristine credit quality and Arbor has a competitive advantage in this space given its history and performance across multiple cycles."" ""While we expect interest rate volatility in 2022 and some pressure to earnings, we believe the dividend is safe given the payout ratio and our expectation that ABR will continue to comfortably cover the dividend with core earnings,” Love added. All of the above makes it clear why Love is now standing with the bulls. The analyst rates ABR an Overweight (i.e. Buy) while his $20 price target implies an upside of ~17% for the year ahead. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~26% potential total return profile. (To watch Love’s track record, click here) Judging by the consensus breakdown, opinions are anything but mixed. With 3 Buys and no Holds or Sells assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that ABR is a Strong Buy. At $21.67, the average price target implies ~28% upside potential from current levels. (See ABR stock forecast on TipRanks) Redwood Trust (RWT) The second dividend stock we’ll look at is Redwood Trust, another name in the long roster of real estate investment trusts (REITs), a class of company known as dividend champions. Redwood works in residential real estate, investing in a combination of mortgage-backed securities, prime jumbo residential loans, and multifamily securities. Those latter are Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans backed by the Federal government. During the recent first quarter of 2022, Redwood reported the deployment of $128 million worth of capital in new investments. The company also funded $920 million worth of business purpose loans, and distributed $2.5 billion worth of jumbo residential loans. These activities, combined with past quarters’ ongoing loan activity, generated a GAAP income of 24 cents per diluted share. While down sequentially from 4Q21, the Q1 EPS was nearly triple the year-ago value. That income in 1Q22 was enough – and to spare – to cover the 23-cent regular share dividend declared for the quarter. The payment is the second in a row at this level, but the company has raised the dividend 5 times since the June payment of 2020. At the current rate, the dividend of 23 cents annualizes to 92 cents per common share and gives a strong dividend of 9.1%. In addition, Redwood has been moving to expand its lending portfolio. The most recent such move, in April of this year, was the acquisition agreement with Riverbend Funding. The acquisition adds Riverbend’s private mortgage lending to Redwood’s business purpose mortgage platform. The acquisition, for an undisclosed amount, is expected to close by the middle of this year. In an in-depth review of this stock, 5-star analyst Stephen Laws, from investment firm Raymond James, points out that the company’s earnings missed the estimates – but adds, “Originations remained strong in 1Q, and the Riverbend acquisition expands the business purpose lending platform... We expect RWT to maintain the quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share in 2022 and pay a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share in 2023... We believe shares should trade at a premium to book value given the strength in the operating business, dividend growth, our expectation of continued book value growth, and the internal management structure.” In line with these comments, Laws puts a Strong Buy rating on RWT shares, and backs that with a $16 price target, suggesting an upside of 61% in the next 12 months. (To watch Laws’ track record, click here) Overall, Redwood’s 7 recent analyst reviews break down 7 to 1 in favor of Buys over Holds, giving the stock its Strong Buy consensus rating – and showing that Wall Street is clearly aligned with the bullish view here. The shares are trading for $9.91 and the $13.50 average price target points toward a 36% one-year upside.
