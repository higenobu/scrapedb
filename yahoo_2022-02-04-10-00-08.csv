Some products in our articles are from partners who may provide us with compensation, but this doesn’t change our opinions. If you are not already one of the 200 million Primer members, you may want to join sooner than later to avoid paying 17% more for Amazon Prime in 2022. But act fast: On February 18th, new members to Prime will have to pay $139 to join which is a price jump of $20 more than the current $119 annual membership. Current Prime members will be billed at the higher $139 per year rate after March 25th on their payment renewal date. In addition, Amazon is also raising the price for its month-month which will increase by $2 per month to $14.99 per month, up from the current $12.99 per month price. At $14.99 per month, after March 2022, the new monthly rate works out to $179.88 making the new higher annual membership cost of $139 (which is paid in one lump sum annually) a savings of $40.88. One of our savvy Slickdealers shared this tip on keeping your membership at $119 a year for at least a few more years: Give yourself “the gift of prime” and you can purchase a couple of years worth right now for $119. Buy Amazon Prime for Just $119 (before March 25, 2022) You can then apply your purchases each year to stay a member of Prime at the same $119 price well after the $20 price hike takes effect. For example, if your Prime membership expires this year on May 19th, you need to turn off your Prime auto-renewal and on March 19th or 20th, click on the email that was sent after your purchase to activate a new subscription. Do It Again: Then, do the same thing again next year. While this Slick Tip and hack only saves $20, that can add up to $60 or more over a few years. The past rumor of a 2022 price increase for Prime members came directly from a New York Times article that reported on the financial analysts tasked with following Amazon. According to these experts, 2022 will be the year customers in the United States see a new price for Prime with specifics of an exact date and new higher annual fee are currently unknown at the time. But, today we know the increase is confirmed and will start as soon as February 18 for people joining Prime for the first time. Amazon Prime is one of the few services that doesn’t see membership numbers plummet when membership fees go up. In fact, the analysts mention that many Americans can’t see themselves without Prime regardless of its price tag. Even stranger is the notion that some people increase their use of Amazon as yearly fees increase, likely as a way to justify its higher cost. There’s also the question of viable alternative services. Amazon has seen tremendous growth over the past decade, and few competitors can match the scale, availability and shipping speed offered by Prime. While Amazon has decided to go ahead with another bump up its pricing again for 2022, there are still comparable platforms that offer the same (or similar) perks such as Target and Walmart to name a few that can offer similar services for those looking to finally opt-out of Amazon due to the new higher rate. Amazon Prime has become an integral part of most consumers’ shopping habits, and minor price adjustments haven’t seemed to impact subscription numbers. However, it does seem that some folks have a tipping point. A recent active discussion started on our own Slickdeals Twitter account where we asked “At what price would you cancel your Prime Membership?” The ask elicited almost 200 comments and it seems $150 for Prime is the magic number at which people will quit their Prime service for good. Others in the chat mentioned they had already unsubscribed after the price increase of 2018, noting the service no longer provided enough value for them to justify its cost. On the other end of the spectrum are the avid Prime users, who won’t cancel their subscription unless it topped $200/year. The convenience and speed of shopping with Amazon Prime are more than worth the annual subscription fee to these members. And if you’re JPMorgan (whose professional financial analysts calculated the value of all Prime services and tallied them up), people wouldn’t stop paying until the annual fee topped $785. Price increases are nothing new in the world of subscriptions, and Amazon itself has often found reason to hike its rates. Those reasons often tend to arrive every four years –and in 2022, according to analysts who follow and track Amazon’s business, there is not a single reason standout for the price hike, and higher costs from on everything from shipping and labor to construction are behind the Spring 2022 price hike for Prime. Here’s a quick look back at most recent Amazon Prime price increases, how much and when they happened: February 2022: Prime membership jumps another $20 to $139/year. June 2018: Rates jumped another $20 to its current $119/year cost. March 2014: Membership jumped $20 from $79/year to $99/year. February 2005: Amazon Prime debuts and announced for $79/year. Looking at all of these prices increases, this means joining Prime is now $60 more expensive that is debut at $79 in 2005. Price increases in the past were accompanied by an announcement that rises in costs such as higher rates for shipping and fuel as the main culprit for the new fees. Amazon had also been adding new perks to Prime subscriptions including an enhanced selection of digital content when it launched Amazon Studios (in 2010) which justified their past increases as well. It’s also worth calling out Amazon Prime now offers more than just free and fast 2-day shipping. Prime may have started as a simple e-commerce service, but today it offers these current services and access under Prime: Free same-day shipping, when available Free access to Prime Video catalog Monthly perks for today’s hottest video games Amazon Photos online storage Prime Reading catalog Exclusive deals at Whole Foods Market Access to Prime Day savings Early access to Lightning Deals “Try Before You Buy” option that lets you try out items and only pay for what you keep Free access to streaming music catalog Alexa-enabled easy shopping and delivery notifications This is not even every perk. To many, Amazon Prime isn’t just for shopping – it’s also a primary source of entertainment, allowing them to forgo other monthly fees such as Spotify or Netflix. When you factor in those perks, it’s easy to see why some members are willing to put up with any annual price changes. Technically and legally, anyone can get free shipping from Amazon with a minimum purchase of $25. While it may take a little more time and effort to coordinate your purchases and wait until you have enough to make the $25 minimum, it will give you the benefits of free shipping without the $119 annual cost. Walking away from Amazon Prime can also help people save by helping them avoid all those impulse purchases (of $24 or less) that can arrive as soon as just a few hours, the same or the next day (and without ever leaving home). While this means fewer dopamine hits from instant gratification (it’s Christmas all year) from placing and receiving an order so seamlessly, there could be the benefit of saving hundreds as a result. However, with Amazon Studios currently acting as a true and successful studio in the original programming and movie industry, the success of the studio and the popularity of its offering could be another reason for Amazon to justify its next price hike –and keep people hooked. If you have binged on any of these popular and acclaimed titles below (just a sampling of what came out of Amazon Studios), then any extra hike in prices is probably worth it to major media fans and cord-cutters: Popular Shows from Amazon Studios The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel The Boys Fleabag Bosch Vikings The Wheel of Time Considering we’re now four years out from the last price hike, it seems another one is just around the bend. And if past trends are anything to go by, we can expect to see an annual fee of $139 announced during spring. Amazon Prime might seem like an incredible deal at $119/year, but are you really getting your money’s worth? And at what price would it stop being beneficial to your wallet? While the above perks make it a bit subjective, there’s an easy way to see how much you’re spending (and saving) with Amazon Prime every year. While not the easiest to find on your dashboard, you can use the button and links below to navigate to a page that will allow you run (and export) a very detailed view of what you ordered, how much was each order value and what time and day you ordered. Create an Amazon Order Report Click on the button above or this link. Log in to your account on Amazon. Select the time frame you want to see. Name your report. Select “Request Report” You can also download and export your report to a spreadsheet to analyze your spending in detail. This process will download a spreadsheet with all your purchases for the selected timeframe. While this will give you an exact number for how much you’re spending, determining how much you’re saving in shipping with Amazon Prime is a bit more nebulous. To do this, you’ll need to find all orders under $25.00, as even non-Prime members can qualify for free shipping on most purchases over this threshold. Next, you’ll need to multiple this number by the approximate cost of shipping. Costs of shipping can vary wildly from product to product, with the average cost when ordering from third-party sellers being higher on average than Prime-eligible items. Prime eligible products are closer to $5 in shipping for non-members. So, if you’ve placed 10 Prime-eligible orders under $25.00 within the past year, you’ve may have saved around $50 in shipping fees. Now subtract the yearly Prime fee ($119, using the current rate), and your cost to have a Prime membership that gives you access to all Amazon perks outside of free shipping comes out to $69 per year (an average of $5.75 per month). It’s not a perfect methodology, but Amazon doesn’t give you an easy way to track shipping fees on your orders. If you’re looking for a more accurate number, consider tracking all your would-be shipping fees throughout 2022. If that number ends up larger than your yearly fee, then Prime is a solid investment.

2/4/2022,"A Port Matilda couple was charged Wednesday after a nearly yearlong, undercover investigation into allegations they’ve illegally produced and sold moonshine from their home for more than three decades. Glenn McCleester, 79, and Barbara McCleester, 65, were charged after they told an investigator from the state police Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement they couldn’t make enough moonshine to keep up with demand. The investigation kicked off in April after the alleged bootleggers invited the officer into their home to tout the quality of their moonshine. The recipe, Barbara McCleester said, came from “legendary moonshiner” and late NASCAR driver Junior Johnson. McCleester poured some moonshine on their kitchen table and lit it on fire to show that it burned blue, not orange, an officer wrote in an affidavit of probable cause. “She explained that when the orange color could be seen in the flames that this would be impurities in the product and would cause a hangover after being consumed and that her moonshine was the purest around,” the officer wrote. The McCleesters were accused of selling $60 jugs of moonshine to the undercover officer four times between April and January. Pennsylvania State Police communications director Lt. Adam Reed defended the investigation Thursday, saying the moonshine operation could have been “fairly lucrative.” A defense lawyer was not listed. Each were charged with one misdemeanor count of manufacturing and selling liquor without a liquor license. Glenn McCleester was also charged with three misdemeanor count of unlawful sales of liquor, while Barbara McCleester faces one charge.
