1/23/2022,"Almost 50 years ago, in the early hours of 2 February 1972, the British embassy in Dublin was gutted by fire. This was not an accident. A huge crowd had gathered in protest outside the lovely Georgian terrace in Merrion Square all through the previous day. They cheered as young men climbed across the balconies and smashed a window. They threw in some petrol and lit it. A fusillade of petrol bombs was unleashed from the crowd. People chanted the slogan they had learned from the Watts riots in Los Angeles in 1965: burn, baby, burn. The police did nothing to stop the attack. I was 14 at the time, so I wasn’t there. But some of my older friends were and I wished I had been with them. The assault was organised by the IRA, but most ordinary, peaceful Irish people approved of it. It seemed like the right thing to do, a reasonable response to the massacre the previous weekend in Derry of 13 unarmed civilians by the first battalion of the British army’s Parachute Regiment. A woman waiting for a bus in Dublin told the Irish Times: “I felt outraged that the British should do this and I felt that whatever the rights and wrongs, they would know how we felt when we burned down their embassy.”  The outrage was not just the atrocity in Derry itself. It was also the way the British lied about it, falsely claiming that the paratroopers had come under fire and were protecting themselves against terrorists. The official Widgery inquiry, which essentially repeated this lie, made it clear the British state had no interest in acknowledging what had happened, let alone punishing anyone for what the Derry coroner, Major Hubert O’Neill, called “sheer unadulterated murder”. Against such imperviousness, burning down the embassy did indeed seem like the only way to let the British establishment know how most Irish people felt. Thus, 50 years after the foundation of the Irish Free State, relations between Britain and independent Ireland were about as bad as they could be. There had been other low points, particularly during the Second World War, when Ireland’s neutrality seemed, to many in Britain, a scandalous betrayal. But relations after Bloody Sunday seemed even worse because the slaughter was one episode – albeit an especially disastrous one – in a conflict in Northern Ireland that was still escalating. (1972 would indeed turn out to be the bloodiest year of the Troubles.) It felt in those months almost as if the two states on these islands were sliding uncontrollably into mutual and violent hostility. Yet, just eight days before Bloody Sunday, something completely different had happened. The British prime minister, Edward Heath, and the taoiseach, Jack Lynch, had been together in a ceremonial hall in Brussels to each sign his country’s treaties of accession to the European Economic Community. There are pictures of the two men standing shoulder to shoulder, both beaming with bonhomie. Less than a year after the burning of the embassy in Dublin, the two countries would be close partners in the European project. It is fair to say, moreover, that Ireland owed its place in what was then an exclusive club to its deep economic connection to Britain. On its own, Ireland was too poor to justify a seat at the top table of Europe. It was admitted essentially on Britain’s coat-tails. It is strange, in retrospect, how these two stories ran side by side – one of profound and deeply rooted animosity, the other of intense cooperation; one full of fracturing and division, the other a joint commitment to “ever closer union” in Europe. As it happened, membership of the EU allowed Ireland to wean itself off its dependency on the British economy and to achieve a much more substantial independence. (One of the many things Brexiters could never understand is this notion that the supposedly oppressive EU could be, for small nations, a route out of domination by bigger neighbours.) But it also became a school in which Irish and British governments learned to work very closely, and respectfully, together. That experience, in turn, made possible the joint choreography of the 1990s, the carefully calibrated steps that produced the peace agreement of 1998. By 2011, when the Queen became the first British monarch in a century to visit southern Ireland, it really felt like this good neighbourliness had become a permanent condition, that British arrogance and Irish rage were exhibits in a museum of historical curiosities. That illusion of permanence was shattered by Brexit, not just by the loss of the common ground of EU membership but also by the refusal to think at all about the consequences for the island of Ireland. Many of the Brexiters still see those consequences not as the inevitable results of their own choices, but as some kind of Irish conspiracy to thwart them. There is a corner of their minds in which Brexit would have been a rip-roaring triumph by now if the damned Irish hadn’t spoiled it with their backstops and protocols. The open attempts of the Johnson administration to tear up the agreements on the Irish dimension of Brexit have revived that old spectre, Perfidious Albion. And yet we should remember 1972. Even at that awful nadir, the stakes were far too high for Britain and Ireland to allow their relationship to deteriorate into toxicity. Two little things forced them together: history and geography. The two big islands on our archipelago can no more escape each other’s fates than Britain can float off into the Atlantic away from Europe. Maybe there are even ways in which we understand each other better. Some slow learners in Britain have discovered, after a mere century, that Ireland is an independent country with its own national interests and relationships with Europe. Irish people have discovered that they have no monopoly in these islands on identity crises and binary tribalisms. It is new for Ireland to feel like the more stable and self-confident of the states on the archipelago and new for Britain to be dealing with the fractious aftermath of a nationalist revolution. It may take some time for all of us to get used to these novelties. But in much worse circumstances, we have found ways to face new realities together.

1/23/2022,"NHS trust leaders are divided about whether the government should press ahead with mandatory jabs for healthcare workers in England after the prime minister told MPs he was considering relaxing the policy. About 80,000 frontline NHS workers have still not had a Covid vaccination and have less than two weeks to have their first dose in time to be able to complete the course before the 1 April deadline.  Trusts have been told to begin either dismissing or redeploying unvaccinated staff after 3 February, but there are more than 90,000 vacancies and thousands more absences for Covid-related reasons. On Friday, Boris Johnson told backbench Conservative MPs he was looking again at the policy. Danny Mortimer, deputy chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: “NHS leaders have always been clear there are risks as well as benefits to mandating the Covid-19 vaccination for all health and social care staff.” He said trusts had told the confederation they “would have preferred longer to implement the policy”. “As the deadline approaches some frontline staff will have to leave their present roles if they continue to decline to be vaccinated. This will reduce frontline NHS staff numbers even further and lead to more gaps in capacity at a time of intense pressure and patient demand,” he said. Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said: “Trust leaders are worried about exacerbating staff shortages at a time when the service is under huge operational pressure. At the time it was proposed, our survey found that 90% of trust leaders – regardless of whether they support mandatory vaccinations or not – were concerned about the potential for additional staff gaps in both the NHS and social care. “Some organisations are calling for a delay in this policy, but we don’t think that is the answer. Our survey of trust leaders found a majority backed this policy as a means of protecting colleagues, patients and visitors from cross-infection by unvaccinated staff.” Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “Our view is that mandation of vaccination for health professionals is not the right way forward. Informed choice is much better than forcing people to get it because that just risks generating mistrust.” It was reported last night that an option being considered by Downing Street is to delay the requirement for six months to help quell a revolt among Tory MPs. The compulsory requirement is likely to be “kicked down the road” amid demands by Tory backbenchers for it to be dropped entirely, the Sunday Telegraph reported. Vaccinations were made mandatory for social care staff, which has an even greater shortage of workers than the NHS, but those who are not vaccinated can apply for an exemption on medical or religious grounds, and are able to self-certificate until 31 March. Even so, the number of staff employed directly by care homes has fallen by more than 20,000 since the regulations were introduced in July 2021. Research by the Department of Health and Social Care in December found that 81.9% of social care providers found it more challenging to recruit staff than six months earlier, and 70.3% said it was harder to retain staff. The second most common reason given for workers leaving care homes was that they did not want to be vaccinated. Dr Nikki Kanani, the deputy lead for NHS England’s Covid vaccination programme, said that teams had been going to great lengths to deliver vaccinations, even giving one person with learning needs a jab while they sat in a hot tub at home. “Mandatory vaccination is a government policy but as healthcare professionals we all have a duty to make sure that we are protected, to make sure that our colleagues and our patients are protected,” she said. “I know that our teams will be doing everything they can to continue to have vaccine confidence building conversations and offering that all important vaccination to staff who are yet to have their first, second or their booster dose.” The Department of Health and Social Care said: “Ensuring staff are vaccinated is the right thing to do to protect patients and those in care. The vast majority of NHS staff have had the vaccine, which is our best defence against Covid-19.”",News/Society,Mandatory Covid jabs policy divides NHS leaders in England as deadline nears,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/23/mandatory-covid-jabs-policy-divides-nhs-leaders-in-england-as-deadline-nears
1/23/2022,"Formed from the ashes of previous cult bands, Leeds-based Yard Act are 2022’s anointed guitar act and deservedly so. Northern, observational, shoo-ins for indie disco playlists, it’s tempting to compare them to local heroes Kaiser Chiefs. In truth, The Overload – Yard Act’s debut – better resembles classics such as Blur’s Modern Life Is Rubbish, but as sung by the Fall’s Mark E Smith or Mike Skinner: a takedown of where, who and how we are now, full of declamatory ire and fed-up humour. Money and lack thereof are themes on The Overload, as are nuanced character studies of “tall poppies” and crooks, people who sue the council and those trying to get by without hypocrisy. Yard Act’s core tunefulness and the easy “ba-ba-ba”s on songs such as Land of the Blind go hand-in-hand with unexpected musical feints throughout, with sound effects, ad libs and unexpected guitar counter-melodies keeping listening ears on their toes.  The decade this outfit have spent in other bands pays off in a record that’s raucous and fun, incisive and – as it winds to a close – profoundly heartfelt, as vocalist James Smith apologises disgustedly for the sins of British foreign policy.",Arts/Music,"Yard Act: Overload review – full of anger, humour and effortless tunes",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/23/yard-act-overload-review-an-instant-classic-land-of-the-blind
1/23/2022,"The recent unexpected rise in interest rates could have been the good news that savers had waited so long for. But more than five weeks after the Bank of England increased rates, only four financial firms have passed on the full rise to all, or nearly all, of their variable-rate savings account customers. The Bank decided on 16 December to lift the base rate from its historic low of 0.1% to 0.25%, prompting expectation it would be passed on.  But several banks and building societies boosted rates on just one, or a handful, of accounts in the weeks following the decision, and some have even reduced them. Only Suffolk, Newcastle and Cambridge building societies, and Atom bank, raised rates by the full 0.15% across all, or the majority of their ranges, according to financial data provider Moneyfacts. This leaves the vast majority of long-suffering savers still waiting for a rise that may never come. Some commentators believe this is unlikely to change any time soon, even if – as many expect – the Bank announces another increase on 3 February. Analysts expect further rises this year to take the base rate above 1%. Adrian Lowery, a personal finance expert at investing platform Bestinvest, says that “most of the big banks are uninterested in attracting savers’ deposits … and so will probably decline to pass on base-rate hikes in any meaningful way”. That is echoed by Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, who says: “The banks have plenty of cheap money from the government, so they are in no rush to raise rates to attract more from savers.” Even if providers do nudge up rates, rising inflation will eat away at the value of savings. On Wednesday it emerged that it had jumped to 5.4% – the highest in almost 30 years. Moneyfacts says there is not one standard savings account that can outpace 5.4%, but adds that getting the best deal is essential to soften the impact of the rising cost of living. “It’s imperative that savers continue to monitor and switch if they are on a poor rate,” says Rachel Springall at the data provider. Ipswich-based Suffolk building society says all of its currently available variable rate savings accounts had 0.15% added with effect from 4 January. Newcastle building society says it will apply the rise to the majority of its variable-rate savings accounts, which means that 97% of those who have one will benefit from 1 February. Two recently launched accounts – triple access saver and monthly access saver – will not see a rise, however. Atom bank has raised the rate on its instant saver account (its only variable rate account) by 0.15% to 0.65%, making this one of the best easy-access rates available. Cambridge building society says it will increase by 0.15% its instant access, your saver, first account and 100 day notice accounts from Tuesday. And Yorkshire building society, with nearly 3 million customers, says it is adding 0.1% to its variable-rate savings accounts on 1 February. Most experts say that everyone should aim to have some cash in an easy-access account to provide a financial safety net. Unfortunately, some of the leading ones – including Lloyds Bank’s easy saver, HSBC’s flexible saver and Halifax’s everyday saver – pay just 0.01%. There are providers offering a lot more, though some have restrictions. Topping the table at the time of writing was Shawbrook Bank’s easy-access account, paying 0.67%, though the minimum opening balance is £1,000, and the minimum withdrawal £500. Be aware that savings products are coming and going very quickly, so you may need to act fast. Financial app Chip offers an easy-access account with a relatively good rate, though it was last week reduced from 0.7% to (a still pretty good) 0.61%. Marcus by Goldman Sachs has an online savings account paying 0.6% and you can start with as little as £1. That includes 0.1% interest bonus, fixed for the first 12 months. If you want a return of more than 2%, you will typically have to lock your money away for several years. There are a number of five-year fixed-rate savings bonds paying just over 2%, from the likes of Charter Savings Bank, Hodge Bank, InBank and Monument Bank. Some of the best rates are offered by regular savings accounts, where you put aside money each month. If you have a NatWest current account, you can apply for its digital regular saver, which pays 3% on balances up to £1,000 (and just 0.01% above that). You can withdraw your money at any time, though you can only pay in up to £50 each month. Similarly, Nationwide and TSB have regular savings accounts for current account customers paying 2%. Yorkshire building society last week launched a regular savings account with a lower rate than that – 1% – but boasting an extra perk: the chance to win £1,500 cash prize each month. There will be 11 prize draws, at the start of the month, between March and January 2023, with the account maturing in a year. This easy-access account, called make me a saver, allows customers to pay in up to £150 a month. One big-name provider that was fairly quick to respond to the rate rise was National Savings & Investments (NS&I), which increased rates on three accounts on 29 December. Its direct Isa, direct saver and income bonds now all pay 0.35%. The Isa previously paid just 0.1%, while the other two offered 0.15%. These are far from table-topping – but it is possible that NS&I may soon have to increase them again to get more people through the doors. That is because it has an official target to raise about £6bn in 2021-22. In October, halfway through the current financial year, it revealed it had so far only raised £0.6bn.",Lifestyle/Money,Hopes shattered as banks fail to pass on interest rate rise,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/23/hopes-shattered-as-banks-fail-to-pass-on-interest-rate-rise
1/23/2022,"Past the animal cemetery, the grave of Margaret Greville, the rose garden and the vegetable garden is where I sit. On the sofa. In a cottage, in the grounds of Polesden Lacey in southern England’s Surrey (for all you global readers). PL was Mrs Greville’s weekend house, for parties – imagine! It is enormous, with a gold saloon that was made for gossiping about others in corners. At Christmas it is the most festive – almost aggressively so – of any stately home I’ve seen. Anyway, I am kneeling on the sofa, looking out into the garden, watching the visitors and feeling very smug that I am indoors on such a drizzle of a day, with the promise of a jigsaw. And a chocolate bar so exquisite I am going to dedicate this whole column to it: Continuum Conceits Ile de Ré salted caramel sauce in 42% milk chocolate, chucked into my bag as an after thought. A small bar, just 45g but with chunky pieces. The chocolate is perfect: creamy but proper with a thick, thick underlay, and the salted caramel sauce, which I yawned at, is indeed, made with fresh cream and oozes delight. Isn’t this time of year all about self care?  Alexandra, the one woman behind CC, told me it was a special she made every year, but no longer stocked it. Nonsense, Alexandra, I said, channelling Mrs Greville, my readers must have it.

1/23/2022,"Most creatives yearn to build their own home, experimenting with materials, styles and ideals. Type “self build” into Google and up will pop homes ranging from the singular to the outlandish. Triangular houses squeezed into tight urban spots, round houses perched on stilts like landlocked moons – the vacant plot is your blank canvas. Garvan de Bruir’s home in Kildare, Ireland, is a case in point. A designer-craftsman best known for his leather bags and accessories, de Bruir drew on the history of aviation to build his unusual, timber-framed dwelling. “The technical term is a monocoque, which refers to the cocooning shape of an aircraft’s fuselage. It’s thin, but by virtue of its curved profile – like a shell – it’s also very strong.” It is also eco-friendly. “You use the minimum amount of materials for maximum effect.”  The result is hard to miss. The Aviator Haus is a gleaming, hoop-shaped structure rising from flat green fields, where a low stone wall is all that remains of a former abbey. Previously a scrap yard, the site later became an industrial zone. “Because I built my workshop here I was allowed to add a home as well,” says de Bruir who built the two-bedroom, prefabricated structure himself. Its pre-insulated components were digitally cut and assembled in sections, as neatly as Lego, over the course of a few weeks. The ideas behind his home grew out of his fascination with wood and its architectural potential. He studied furniture making at Buckinghamshire Chilterns University in High Wycombe, the former furniture making hub of the UK. “During the Second World War, local factories also made parts for aircraft. A shortage of metal led to a return to timber. They used plywood, heavily engineered for strength. I began thinking about how I could apply those techniques to architecture.” His “melting pot of ideas” home was executed on a tight “self-builders’ budget. It was about materials and economy.” The curving outer shell is covered in a powder-coated corrugated iron, riveted like a fuselage. “It is what they use for local farm buildings, but unfortunately the planners wouldn’t allow me to use the classic agricultural red oxide colour.” For the exterior, he used cedar cladding with inexpensive PVC framed windows. Measuring a lean 5m wide by 10m long, there is an open-plan living area downstairs with two bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs, where light spills in through windows at either end. “It’s your classic terrace house,” smiles de Bruir, industrious in his leather apron. Of course, it is not really. “In a traditional house the ceiling corners of the top floor rooms are dead space. By eliminating them you cut down on the energy needed to heat the space,” he explains. “A typical house requires thick walls to support a heavy roof; the curved profile does away with that, reducing the materials needed.” With its gently sloping walls and wood panelling, the interior feels as cosy as a woodland cabin mixed with the economical elegance of a ship’s cabin. “The different woods add texture and warmth,” he says, pointing out the floors, made from a budget-engineered wood (OSB) produced in Waterford. The staircase which twirls gracefully upstairs is made from offcuts. The walls are clad in plywood also used to make the kitchen with its ingeniously curved doors and shelves full of cheerful pottery. There is leather in unusual details, like the handles or hinges, inspired by vintage luggage design. “Leather as a building material has been overtaken by plastic or metal. But its strength and flexibility makes it so versatile.” Other experiments include the leather tables and chairs perching on animated, curving legs. He uses whole sections of leather for his designs, unlike mass-produced pieces, which are generally made from smaller cuts stitched together. “Wrapping a bag in one piece of leather makes it much more durable. Fewer joins mean it’s structurally far stronger,” he says.“Typically there would be four panels of leather stitched together to create the bucket shape. However my design is moulded as a single piece. It’s a medieval process called ‘cuir bouilli’ which craftsmen used to make armour by boiling and moulding leather to the shape of a torso.” De Bruir built his “singleform” house as a prototype. Ideally he would like to roll it out commercially as home or studio solutions. “I am still working out the costs, but it would be very economical.” The interior’s snugness and tactility, he says, have also made it a delight to live in. The modular structure will make it easy to produce different versions with more windows, rooms and a deeper footprint. Picture a row of his Aviator Hauses set in their own green plots, glinting softly against blue skies.

1/23/2022,"While training to become a GP, Gavin Francis became ill with a severe sinus problem. In acute pain and exhausted as he waited for an operation, he chose to reduce his hours to three days a week. “I persuaded myself that there was no point risking burnout for the sake of sticking to a schedule,” he writes in his new book, Recovery: The Lost Art of Convalescence. “I qualified all the same, albeit a couple of months late.” This strikes me as an unusually proactive “physician heal thyself” attitude for a junior doctor. But Francis’s whole approach to practising medicine feels unusual. Growing up in Fife with a passion for science, he chose to study medicine because “I wanted to have a job that would give me a kind of trade; all the men in my family seemed to have a trade of one sort or another.” Then there’s the fact that on qualification, after a year as a junior house officer, he headed off to explore the wildest parts of the world for a decade, visiting the Arctic, motorbiking across Asia to New Zealand, and working for the British Antarctic Survey.  “It was so peaceful,” he says of his time there when we speak over Zoom. “There was so much time for contemplation.” He missed the buzz of clinic life, but he already knew he did not want to return to emergency medicine. “I didn’t want to go back to that highly pressurised environment of resus and ambulance sirens.” Now he tells medical students to “look at the doctors around them, look at the lifestyle they have and imagine if they want their lifestyle to look like that in 20 years’ time. I suppose it would be fair to say I was quite good at doing that early on.” In his work as a GP, Francis spends half the week in a small practice in Edinburgh, including a morning a week at a clinic for the homeless, which he’s just left when we speak. Two or three times a year, he helps out in remote Hebridean island practices, immersed in the wild, landscapes and big skies he believes help him stave off burnout. The rest of the time he spends with his primary school-age children and his writing: essays, reviews and books, on travel and wild places, and on his experiences at the frontline of general practice, including the gripping, tender, bestseller Adventures in Human Being, described by Hilary Mantel as “sober and beautiful”. “I love practising medicine,” he says. “And I can’t imagine stopping, but it’s quite emotionally exhausting. I discovered early on that a really wonderful way for me to do medicine that made me more effective as a doctor and also helped me flourish, I suppose, as a human being, was to do a full intense day and then to have a day off to think about it and contemplate it.” Francis devotes time to his own recovery from a job notorious for burnout and never more so than now, as an underfunded, traumatised NHS faces another winter of Covid firefighting. (“The days of people clapping on Thursday are long gone,” he says. “People are getting really, really tired after two years of this.”) Avoiding getting depleted to a point where he is “exhausted and inffective as a doctor” is both for his own and his patients’ benefit. “I needed to find a way of doing medicine that helps my patients, too, that is a much more sustainable, creative, mutually helpful relationship.” This makes him the ideal person to explore the “lost art” of recovery and convalescence. It’s also something that has been in the forefront of his mind for a while. “In 2020, I spent such an extraordinarily large amount of my time talking to people about recovery and convalescence, not just recovery from Covid, but from all the crises of mental health that were provoked by lockdowns and just also talking to people about recovery from surgery, from emotional crises in their life… It came up again and again.” He wrote his latest book, he says, because “I realised there are huge numbers of things I take for granted in those consultations that my patients don’t, and I wanted to put them all in one place.” The slim volume he has produced – a collection of reflections, really – is humane and thoughtful. Combining personal reminiscence, hard science and history, it explores the architecture of convalescence, rest, treatments and placebos, the healing power of nature and the transformative impact a sick note can have. I particularly like this section, I tell him, which provides a powerful counter-narrative to tabloid tales of malingering and fraud. It was influenced by Francis’s early working experiences in Muirhouse, an area of socio-economic deprivation. “One of the GPs there taught me that sick notes can be the most powerful prescription I ever write. Most people try and go back to work too quickly; the amount of abuse in the sick note system is tiny, about 1%. It can be a lovely thing to actually reassure somebody, ‘You need time, you need to give some respect to this process.’” He likes, too, the fact that a sick note can be deliberately left vague. “Quite often, I’ll put ‘life crisis’. If somebody’s basement is flooded, their cat died, and their wife left them all in the same week, that’s a life crisis.” Recovery is fascinating, too, on the greater respect convalescence was accorded in the past. Francis describes the “glorious, sunlit, south-facing” wards and wide wheelchair-friendly corridors of the Princess Margaret Rose hospital in Edinburgh, which was designed in the 1930s for patients to recuperate from tuberculosis. Another convalescent hospital where he worked, the Astley Ainslie, “was set up in the 1920s not only to help patients convalesce after acute illness, but also to fatten them up before surgery. It’s amazing, now to get a single night in a hospital bed, you have to have a medical diagnosis and a plan in place that’s going to prioritise getting you out as quickly a possible.” Of course, there are many things we do better now: “We’re doing mental health a lot better, the range of treatments we have available are fantastic, the fact that you’re not plunging your family into destitution every time you get ill, all those kinds of things are much better.” But the Victorians and Edwardians were more enlightened when it came to valuing rest and understanding how slow recovery can be. The book is clear-sighted and accepting of the limitations of what doctors can do, particular in relation to chronic conditions and that slow, often non-linear, process of recovery. “People get a slightly inflated sense of the power of western medicine sometimes,” says Francis, “and they’re quite surprised we don’t have an answer. I wanted to lay that out – that lots of times in medicine we can’t cure what’s going on.” This feels particularly timely, as a survey reveals there are 1.3 million long Covid sufferers in the UK, many struggling with the lack of effective treatment strategies. “People can get frustrated when I say we don’t understand the reasons for post-viral fatigue, we don’t really have a good grasp on what the mechanism is,” Francis says. “We are frustrated, too.” This is, he reminds me, not a new phenomenon. “The ancient Greeks talked about post-viral fatigue and we are not really a huge amount further on.” The chapter called “Snakes and Ladders” reproduces the pro-forma NHS advice a long Covid-suffering friend also received, with its advice to: “Don’t rush, get fresh air, push, don’t pull, slide, don’t lift…” She found it both helpful and maddening, I tell him, reading out what she texted me: “Basically what you are told is, ‘Sorry your life sucks, that is just the way it is now and you have to deal with it.’” Francis thinks it’s not quite that negative or judgmental (though he accepts it’s “typical NHS: one form for everybody whether you are 80 or 20”). “You’re in this predicament and here are some ways we’ve seen to be effective to get out of your predicament. I wish there was a pill for this but there isn’t.” He’s acutely aware how scary Covid has been for many sufferers: “I’ve had 25-year-old marathon runners take weeks to recover, have weeks where they were struggling to walk up their first-floor stairs. It’s frightening to be reminded of your mortality and how fragile we can be.” Many patients take comfort, he says, in knowing they are not alone and that most sufferers make a good recovery in the end. “People recover from Covid. The figures are starting to come in. There’s a long tail, but it does continue to drop, the number of people still experiencing symptoms just goes down and down.” He promises me, too, that the pandemic will end, when I ask, plaintively, though a respiratory specialist colleague predicted we were in for five years when they spoke in June 2020. Recovery is not a book that pretends to have the answers, other than the overarching message that healing – from anything – is completely specific to the individual and is a process that requires patience, from both sufferer and physician. Accompanying a patient on a long, unpredictable recovery feels to me like a different job and skill set than the one most people become doctors for. But for Francis, it’s absolutely part of the job. “If you go into medicine expecting to cure all your patients, you’re going to be disappointed very quickly. If my job can somehow ease suffering a little, or give someone a little more dignity or a bit more autonomy, even if I can’t do anything about their condition, then it’s probably worthwhile.” Although “carbon guilt” may have put paid to some of the wilder far-flung adventures Francis would have undertaken 20 years ago, he’s planning to get back out for some “big overland trips” with the family when Covid allows and his children are old enough to enjoy them. In the short term, he’s planning a road trip to northern Italy’s Po Valley, to visit his wife’s family, and respecting the “really lovely rhythm” that works for him. “I would love to persuade more of my colleagues that’s a good model,” he says, but staffing challenges (“We need far more doctors and nurses in this country”) sadly make it unrealistic. Even with all the frustrations of working in the NHS in 2022, Francis can’t imagine wanting to do anything different, as long as it is balanced with enough breathing space. “It’s a wonderful job as long as you can keep the pressures of it within certain bounds. It’s immensely satisfying, no two days are the same and you have this wonderful opportunity to meet all kinds of people and have sometimes transformational, sometimes quite mundane conversations with them and do something often quite modest, small and realistic about making their lives a little bit better… You can’t ask any better than that.” Recovery: The Lost Art of Convalescence by Gavin Francis is published by Profile at £4.99.

1/23/2022,"With the culture secretary Nadine Dorries’s announcement last week that the licence fee will be frozen for two years, the BBC’s future is at best uncertain and possibly terminal, at least in the form that we’ve come to know and often love it. In its centenary year the corporation is under existential threat not just from this government but also the streaming companies that have most benefited from the digital revolution. One hundred years ago the BBC was itself a startup attempting to exploit a relatively new but not very well-understood technology: wireless. There’s a modern-day wisdom about startups that says only three people are really needed – someone to build the product, someone to make it attractive, and someone to sell it. Or to put it in today’s language, a hacker, a hipster and a hustler. David Hendy, a professor of media and cultural history, opens The BBC: A People’s History with three men looking for an office to house their new enterprise, the British Broadcasting Company, as it was then called. The men are Cecil Lewis, a former fighter pilot still in his early 20s with an idealistic sense of culture’s edifying value; John Reith, a rather stern moralist with an organising zeal; and Arthur Burrows, the only one who actually had experience of working on wireless.  With a certain creative licence, you might say that Burrows was the hacker, Lewis the hipster and Reith the hustler. Hendy doesn’t employ that taxonomy but he does set the scene rather well of these three influential figures at the dawning of what would turn out to be this country’s biggest and most significant cultural institution. The reader is prepared for a dramatic tale of innovation and determination as the trio succeed in establishing their new business amid a hostile and powerful Fleet Street resistance. Yet no sooner does Hendy introduce these characters than they largely slip out of the narrative. Instead, an array of other functionaries appear and pretty soon Lewis is gone, the BBC has become a corporation and listening to the radio has shifted from an obscure hobby for the wealthy to a national pastime. Exactly how that transformation takes place is lost in an abundance of information that never quite forms into a dynamic narrative. The book is an authorised history, insofar as the BBC has made its archives available to Hendy, though, as he emphasises, without any editorial control or influence. Yet there is nevertheless a sense of obligation in the writing, a need to cover the ground, even when it’s not that interesting or new. The other aspect of the book is that it’s a “People’s History”, which means that there is a Mass Observation-style element to it, with the public being frequently quoted to underline the contract between the broadcaster and its audience. It’s a contract that Reith saw in paternalistic terms, requiring the BBC to play the role of nation’s conscience and moral improver, while notionally maintaining a position of journalistic impartiality. It was and remains a tricky balancing act, further complicated by the BBC’s ambiguous relationship with the state and, more pressingly, whichever government is in power. As Hendy writes: “Since the BBC was never going to please everyone, it often tried instead not to offend anyone.” These are hoary subjects that the author revisits dutifully without adding any particularly fresh insight. It is, however, to this more political understanding of the BBC that he is repeatedly drawn. In a narrative of 570 pages, more than 100 of them are devoted to the second world war, when the BBC became the central voice of Britain’s plight and a vital conduit for government propaganda. It was also itself subject to myth creation. Churchill’s famous “We shall fight them on the beaches” speech may have roused the Commons, but was not the inspirational event of legend when he repeated it on radio, as Hendy reminds us. The war also delayed the development of what would become the BBC’s main concern and purpose, namely television. The suits at the BBC are often accused of being uninterested in programme-making, and the same criticism might be levelled at this book, which is much more inclined to revisit administrative tensions than explore creative talent. In this era of technological upheaval, when cultural gatekeepers have been falling like ninepins, the idea of a licence fee and a public broadcaster are in danger of appearing increasingly anachronistic – a vulnerability Dorries is busy exploiting. Hendy is understandably sympathetic to the corporation, quoting Clive James: “The Beeb is a great institution, always to be defended against its enemies, which include itself.” James, however, knew what was great about the BBC beyond its symbolism and sense of purpose. He was a connoisseur of its actual product, and a strong sense of what that has entailed is what is most conspicuously missing from this conscientious but rather pedestrian history.

1/23/2022,"During the pandemic, the UK and other rich nations have relied on African doctors and nurses to shore up their health services. Now the continent’s chief health leader is hoping to put the brain drain into reverse with a plan to persuade African expats to return.  Dr John Nkengasong, the head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), said they were planning a programme to attract scientists, doctors and nurses back from the diaspora. “The leadership of the continent must invest in strengthening health systems,” Nkengasong said, in an interview with the Observer. “We need a very deliberate programme that facilitates Africans in the diaspora to come back to the continent and do a rotation. A Ghanaian or Nigerian in London doesn’t just wake up in the morning and think, ‘I’m going to go to Nigeria for a year.’ That person needs lodging, basic transportation. They have responsibilities, a job.” He said the Africa CDC would soon put forward a package of measures to the African Union commission to create a regional health treaty to govern the pandemic response, which would include support for expatriates. Research by the House of Commons library last year showed that 2.5% of NHS England’s 1.35 million staff were African. The largest proportion were the 10,494 from Nigeria, with a further 4,780 from Zimbabwe, 3,395 from Ghana and 2,895 from Egypt. Nigeria has about 72,000 registered doctors, but only 35,000 were practising in the country in 2021, according to Abba Moro, a Nigerian senator. The Africa CDC set up seven working groups allowing doctors and scientists working in richer countries to give regular advice remotely. “They have been extremely useful during this pandemic,” Nkengasong said. “We need to formalise it and facilitate the return to the continent to support the public need.” Africa seems to have suffered less severely from Covid and its variants than other continents. About 10 million people are estimated to have been infected but that is probably an undercounting, Dr Nkengasong said, and about 220,000 people have died. “That’s relatively low for a continent of 1.3 billion,” he said. “We saw India was overwhelmed by Covid in May, you couldn’t hide it. We’ve not seen a scenario in Africa where people are dying on the streets. “I think there is a puzzle of why many more people have been infected in Africa, but it has not translated into many deaths. That is a research question we need to investigate, and also how many deaths we are missing. “We have to be prepared for variants to emerge that will be more challenging than what we are dealing with.” Africa CDC has been instrumental in creating the Sentinel network of labs to track the virus using genomic sequencing that led to the detection of the Omicron variant in Botswana in November. “We have the infrastructure in place to detect early, prevent and respond,” he said. “Take west Africa – there’s a lot of public health assets there. The Noguchi [Medical Research] Institute in Nigeria is a state-of-the-art facility. The Pasteur Institute in Cote d’Ivoire, the Pasteur Institute in Senegal, the Medical Research Council in the Gambia – but they were not talking to each other. The whole concept of this new public health order is to use as much in the region as you can.” He added that in 2018 he was contacted by public health officials in Sierra Leone about a suspected monkeypox case, asking for help to find someone at the US CDC to test for the disease. “I said no, if you send that to Cote d’Ivoire, I know they have the primers to help you do that.” That mindset of Africans always needing help from richer western nations is far too widespread, he said. “People see the continent as a place to go, do a few projects, gather the data, publish it, do a few clinical trials and get out. That is not global health. It should be an equal partnership, recognising that the principal investigators should come from the developing countries.” The pandemic provided an example of the limits of western help, he said, with the WHO’s Covax programme. The Gavi alliance, which directs the programme, had pledged 2bn doses of vaccines to 144 poorer countries in 2021, but managed about 900m. Earlier this month, poorer nations rejected 100m doses that were close to expiring. There have been heated debates about whether western countries were hoarding vaccines. “Covax represents the best mechanisms of global cooperation,” Nkengasong said. “But look at what happened. It’s a good example of where good intention is not matched by reality. The promissory note that African countries would get vaccines at the same time didn’t happen. “And what we did, under the leadership of President Ramaphosa, we established the African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team and we were able to acquire 400m doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.” So far Africa CDC has launched 12 pandemic initiatives, he said. As well as genomic surveillance and vaccines, there are plans to secure diagnostics and testing kits, and medical supplies.",News/World news,Africa’s health boss seeks to tempt expat medics to come back home,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/africas-health-boss-seeks-to-tempt-expat-medics-to-come-back-home
1/23/2022,"Farmers are putting off planting trees because of the uncertainty surrounding the government’s plans for subsidies based on protecting nature, delaying the UK’s efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and stem the drastic decline in farmland wildlife. New farm payments are expected from 2024, under the post-Brexit subsidy regime the government has promised, but farmers fear if they plant trees now they will not get the credit for it when the new schemes start. Meanwhile, they face potentially losing their existing subsidies if they switch to more tree-planting now.  Ministers have repeatedly stressed that future payments to farmers will be on the principle of “public money for public goods”, meaning farmers will be paid for taking care of the land and wildlife, under “environmental land management contracts” or ELMs. But farmers have told the Observer there are too few details available about the expected new system, four years after it was promised by the government. This leaves farmers in limbo. If they use land currently in food production to plant trees, they could forfeit their existing subsidies, called basic payments. Many farmers are also tied into stewardship agreements with the government, under which they receive special subsidy payments for good environmental management. But these are so inflexible that farmers cannot plant trees as this would violate their agreement. “We are grateful for the stewardship payments, but it is difficult to change them,” said Martin Hole, a livestock farmer in Sussex. “Farmers are in a pinch. This is happening to me, and I hear it from many others. We want to plant trees, but there may be financial penalties if we do.” Hole wanted to triple the area of woodland on his farm, but could not make the finances work, as it would mean redrawing his current stewardship arrangement and he is unsure of any future support. Richard Bramley, an arable farmer south of York, who chairs the National Farmers’ Union environment forum, faces a similar quandary. He said the government had not yet set out details of how farmers would be encouraged to plant trees and hedgerows in future. “There is just so little information. Planting trees requires capital and time, and is a permanent change so you want to get it right.” Trees are an integral part of environmentally beneficial farming, as they provide habitats for wildlife, help prevent flooding, store carbon and clean the air. They also benefit farmers, providing shade and shelter for livestock, and encouraging pollinators. Planting trees requires significant investment, however. Rhys Evans, a beef and sheep farmer in south Snowdonia, is planting 1km of hedgerow, with fence poles costing £3 each and £30 for corners, even before the cost of the 7,000 saplings required, and labour. “It’s very expensive. There will be long-term benefits, and we want to do it, but many farmers who are less proactive will be put off,” he said. Martin Lines, chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, said farmers were increasingly aware of the benefits of trees and hedgerows, but needed more encouragement to start planting. “We’re getting mixed signals,” he said. “The government needs to give us more reassurance.” Organic farmers are also being deterred from investing in agroforestry, combining forestry with food production by growing trees that produce organic nuts and fruit in among crops or livestock pasture. Guy Singh-Watson, founder of Riverford, the vegetable box company, said: “Some of these trees are not native, they are European or American, so they might not be included in a requirement to plant native species. The government has shown little interest in agroforestry in general.” The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pointed to its scheme for farmers to plant as little as one hectare of trees. “By taking up grants such as the England Woodland Creation Offer now, farmers and landowners will be able to transfer into future environmental land management schemes at agreed points without having to repay their current funding,” a spokesperson said. However, farmers said the woodland creation scheme was not suitable for all farms, as it was geared to those who could afford to take a significant area out of production. Many are also concerned about what would happen if the trees failed, or were damaged by storms, deer or rabbits, as they could be held liable for fresh investment to replant the woodland. As many as one in four trees can require replanting, even in good circumstances. Farm subsidies are a devolved policy across the UK, but Scotland and Wales face similar issues. Hywel Morgan, with a hill farm in the western Brecon Beacons, told the Observer many farms nearby were being bought up by corporations to grow forests for carbon credits, to offset their carbon emissions. “What about those of us who want to continue as family farms? I can’t see how planting these trees but then importing food makes sense [for the environment]. I’d like to plant trees but to farm too.” Ministers must act faster, urged Ben Raskin, head of horticulture and agroforestry at the Soil Association. “This is a complex and long-term issue, but they should not make us wait until they have something they think is perfect. We would like to see some interim help at least, on agroforestry and hedgerows. Farmers want to be doing more now.”",News/Environment,"Farmers’ tree dilemma: if we plant woodland, will we take a cash hit?",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/23/farmers-tree-dilemma-if-we-plant-woodland-will-we-take-a-cash-hit
1/23/2022,"The magic number is 54. This is how many Tory MPs have to write a secret letter to the chairman of their 1922 Committee in order to trigger a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson. There are easily more than 54 Conservative MPs who think their leader is a busted flush, who appreciate the risk his attempts to hang on to the premiership will inflict lasting reputational damage on their party and who understand that Britain won’t return to anything resembling seemly and orderly government until he is gone. One senior Tory ended a conversation with me by quoting François Rabelais: “Bring down the curtain, the farce is over.” Quite a lot share the public revulsion with the lockdown-busting of the prime minister and his staff. Some agree that he lied to MPs and that it is critical to the integrity of our politics that deliberately misleading parliament is always treated as a resignation offence. More are agitated about what leaving Mr Johnson in place means for their electoral prospects. All can read the opinion polls. His personal ratings have plunged to depths not even plumbed by Theresa May at her lowest point. This strongly suggests we are witnessing the implosion of the Cult of Johnson that I wrote about at the time of the last Tory party conference. And yet Sir Graham Brady, the man who keeps count of the letters, has not announced that the magic number has been reached. Tory MPs scheme, gossip, brief, speculate and plot. With a few exceptions, what they have not done is act.  One of the exceptions is David Davis, the prominent Brexiter and former cabinet minister. He waited until Prime Minister’s Questions had gone into injury time before he rose to confront the prime minister by quoting Leo Amery quoting Oliver Cromwell. “In the name of God, go.” Things would be much easier for Tories if their leader took that advice and walked away. That would spare everyone the spectacle of ministers tortuously trying to defend the indefensible. His departure would probably reduce the chances of more Tories following the example of Christian Wakeford, the Bury South MP who defected to Labour. A swift exit is not the outcome desired by Labour, which is best served by weeks more of dreadful headlines for the Tories, accompanied by poisonous infighting among them. So you can see why some Conservative MPs are attracted to the notion that their leader might be induced to announce that he is off to spend more time with his families. Mr Johnson’s friends have often heard him whingeing that he can’t live on the salary while moaning that being prime minister is not as much fun as he thought it would be. It never seems to have occurred to him that making money and having a laugh are not the top lines of the job description. On the retelling of Dominic Cummings, his former boon companion turned enemy, Mr Johnson was bored with being prime minister within a month of the 2019 election. “This job,” he groaned. “It’s like getting up every morning pulling a 747 down the runway.” Even as a disgraced ex-prime minister, a lucrative afterlife would await him as a celebrity speaker. He could return to writing columns for the Telegraph, a much more appropriate vocation for him than heading a government. He could finish his long-delayed book, Shakespeare: The Riddle of Genius. He could then pen his memoirs, which he has the ego to entitle Johnson: The Wronged Genius. To go now might earn him a bit of redemption with his party, and possibly even with some of the public, for eventually doing the decent thing. You probably choked as hard reading that last sentence as I did writing it. Anyone acquainted with his biography knows how unfamiliar he is with the concept of doing the decent thing. Putting the interests of others before his own is alien to a man who has always been governed entirely by his ambitions and appetites. His remaining allies are busy briefing friendly journalists that he will fight to stay in Number 10 to the bitter end. They would say that, of course. They hope to deter Tory MPs from moving against him by filling them with terror that prising him out will be a grisly enterprise with no guarantee of success. One former cabinet minister predicts: “Boris will only be dragged out of Number 10 with his fingernails clinging to the door. There will be scratch marks down the woodwork.” The battle to save his skin has already turned vicious. From William Wragg, a Tory committee chairman who was once a keen supporter of the prime minister, we have heard charges that blackmail is being used against MPs suspected of wanting him gone. Mr Wragg thinks this is another scandal and one grave enough to merit investigation by the police. Westminster has always been associated with dark arts and dirty tricks, but intimidating MPs by threatening to cut off government funding for schools or hospitals in their constituencies takes things to a previously unvisited and atrocious level. That is government by extortion racket. Another sign of Mr Johnson’s desperation is “Operation Save Big Dog”, the puerile appellation apparently invented by himself to describe the effort to buy him more time. The attempt to pander to rightwing Tories by throwing them lumps of “red meat” included spinning a yarn that asylum seekers could be sent to Ghana. The government of the west African country exposed that as fiction by ridiculing it as “Operation Dead Meat”. There is no step too low for Mr Johnson, including trashing Britain’s international reputation. The longer Tory MPs prevaricate, the more they become complicit in this scandal and the less the public will trust the lot of them. They surely know this. So what is stopping them? One scenario haunting the Conservative benches is that a confidence vote is triggered in the next few weeks, Mr Johnson just scrapes through and then insists he has a right to carry on. They would then be stuck with a leader who was finished, but not finished off. That prompts some Tories to seek reasons to delay the moment when they reckon with the mistake their party made when it gave him the premiership in the first place. I hear some Conservative MPs arguing that he should be given a period of “probation” to see whether he can put together a more professional team at Number 10 and run a better government. That’s like having Dracula before you and a stake to hand, but offering him three months to prove that he can be a vegetarian. Then there are those dithering Tory MPs who contend that they should put the decision in the hands of the voters by waiting for the May elections. One Conservative MP reports that his local councillors are angrily demanding: “Why should we be sacrificed because Tory MPs lack a spine?” The most common mantra on the Tory benches is “wait for Sue Gray”. The bulk of them have fallen in behind the idea that they should pause until the senior civil servant has concluded her investigation into the parties scandal. The Johnson loyalists are hoping that Ms Gray will grant him some kind of reprieve by widely spreading culpability for the rule-breaking booze-ups at Number 10. Even before Ms Gray had completed her interviews, the prime minister’s propagandists were putting it about that her report would exonerate him from the most damning charges. That’s a dangerous game for Number 10 to be playing, not least because Ms Gray will have a strong regard for her own credibility. Someone who knows her well remarks: “She will be very pissed off by that.” Some of the Tory MPs who want him gone, but have yet to say so into a microphone, are indicating that they are waiting for the release of the report before they add their voices to those calling for his resignation. Ms Gray’s findings are now expected to be published this week, later than originally planned. That’s because she has uncovered more evidence about Number 10’s party culture as she has gone along. The prime minister has committed himself to being questioned about it by MPs, who should insist that the report is published in full. Ms Gray is a civil servant, not an independent prosecutor or judge. Her findings, and the degree of severity with which she chooses to word them, can tip the scales for or against the prime minister with Tory MPs, but ultimately they will have to make the decision. Those who want rid of Boris Johnson will have to be as resolute about evicting him as he is frantic to cling on.
