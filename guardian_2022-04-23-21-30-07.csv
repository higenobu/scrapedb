4/23/2022,"Survivors of the Rwandan genocide who currently live in the hostel that will house asylum seekers sent from the UK under a controversial Home Office plan were dispatched on a day trip to prevent them disrupting the visit of home secretary Priti Patel this month, the Observer has learned. Patel toured the hostel, known as Hope House, when she was in Kigali to sign the deal with Rwanda. Her visit was carefully managed by both the Rwandan authorities and the Home Office to present the plan in the best possible light. The proposal has been widely condemned as inhumane, illegal, unworkable and prohibitively expensive. Critics have included Tory MPs and peers, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) and the archbishop of Canterbury, who said in his Easter Sunday sermon that the scheme “does not stand the judgment of God”. The asylum seekers from the UK will be housed at Hope House, a facility built to provide safe accommodation and a “new family” to between 150 and 190 young people orphaned in the 1994 genocide, when up to 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus died in three months of mass killing. Many of the survivors have now moved out, but those who remain have spent most of their lives in the hostel and have limited resources. On the day of Patel’s visit, 22 residents were told by authorities they were being taken on a 56-mile round trip to the southern town of Bugesera, where they spent much of the day viewing genocide memorials. After returning to Kigali, they were taken to parliament to see another memorial. They returned to Hope House after the British officials had gone. “This is why we think everything is not done in good faith,” one resident told the Observer. The UK government has said it will pay an initial £120m to the Rwandan government for implementing the plan, but will have to pay additional costs for housing, food and travel. The residents of Hope House, formerly know as the Association of Student Survivors of Genocide (AERG) hostel, have been told they will be rehoused to make room for the asylum seekers sent from Britain. They expressed concerns about their future. “Often, residents who leave the hotel come back after failing to get jobs. It is hard outside here when you don’t have a job,” one told the Observer last week. A second worried that pledges to find them alternative homes would not be fulfilled. “The government is saying it will rent us somewhere else but we don’t believe it,” he said. “They are telling us to go but they haven’t given us money. Remember, some of these survivors lost entire family. Where do they want us to go?” The residents asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. A Rwandan government spokesperson told the Observer that to suggest the Hope Hostel is an orphanage, or is a venue intended to house orphans of the genocide, was “incorrect”. “Hope Hostel was built to accommodate student survivors of genocide but is no longer used for these purposes as most of the residents are adults with jobs and families, and are living independently,” the spokesperson said. “Currently Hope Hostel is hosting a small number of people, the youngest of whom is 29. Some in this group are in the process of graduating from university and college. It has been agreed they will soon leave and become eligible for living allowances until they find employment. [The] AERG has had plans to convert the facility into a commercial hostel for some time.” Audace Mudahemuka, president of AERG, said the hostel was built by Rwandan donors to support student survivors and had “served a wonderful purpose.” “But it was being wound down long before the government contacted us about leasing it for this programme. Only a small fraction of the beds in the hostel were being used, and the facility is expensive to maintain. We were delighted when the government offered to rent the property, as the funds we receive from them will allow us to provide support to hundreds or even thousands of genocide survivors through our other projects across the country’, Mudahemuka said. Officials did not deny reports of the day trip, saying only that “residents at Hope Hostel can come and go as they please.” There are also doubts about Patel’s claim that migrants sent to Rwanda after illegally entering the UK would thrive there if their asylum claims are refused. Reporters who accompanied the home secretary were introduced to a couple from Yemen who ran a successful cafe. Burhan Almerdas, 37, praised the Rwandan people as “welcoming” and said there was a business-friendly local environment. But though Rwanda has been credited with rapid economic growth, some statistics are contested, and the benefits of any new prosperity are not evenly shared. Bapaste Gatsinzi, who sought refuge in Rwanda in 2018 from neighbouring Burundi, said he relocated his family to Uganda recently because life is too “difficult” in Rwanda. “I will also join them next month and try life again,” said Gatsinzi, who lived in the eastern province of Cibitoke, a town that borders Burundi. An Ethiopian refugee who settled in 2018 told the Observer: “It’s hard to survive in Rwanda because the cost of living is very high. I set up a grocery but I don’t have customers. People don’t have money, and I will close soon because I cannot afford rent.” An Eritrean who came to Rwanda in 2017 said he had been unable to find regular work and survived on handouts. Most of his friends have relocated to Uganda, he said. Human rights campaigners have long criticised Rwanda’s veteran leader, Paul Kagame, for his intolerance of dissent, and the refugees who spoke to the Observer requested anonymity. According to officials, Rwanda is already home to more than 130,000 refugees from countries such as Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. Opposition politicians in Rwanda have criticised the agreement to accept asylum seekers flown from the UK, saying western countries should “own up to international obligations on the migration issues”. In 2019, Rwanda agreed to take in refugees and asylum seekers evacuated from detention centres in Libya. The country also had a shortlived agreement with Israel. Last week, Kagame rejected criticism of the deal. “We are not trading human beings, please. This is not the case. We are actually helping,” he said. “It’s a clearcut issue and it was actually something of an innovation that Rwanda put forth to deal with this migration issue.”",News/World news,Rwanda genocide survivors moved out of hostel so Priti Patel could inspect it,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/rwanda-genocide-survivors-moved-out-of-hostel-so-priti-patel-could-inspect-it
4/23/2022,"A man has been stabbed and at least 10 others injured by a lone attacker in the Warwickshire town of Bedworth. A 33-year-old man has been arrested, while a man in his 20s is in a stable condition in hospital after being stabbed on Saturday morning, Warwickshire police said. The force said the suspect is from Bedworth, a town around five miles north of Coventry. It said he is believed to have walked along Coventry Road and Gilbert Close, where he assaulted at least 10 people just before 8am. It added that the victims who have been identified so far as suffering minor injuries are assisting officers with their investigation. DS Rich Simpkins described it as a “nasty incident” and appealed for anyone else injured to come forward. “I know this will cause the community great concern,” he said. “The public can expect to see a heightened police presence in and around Bedworth town centre to provide reassurance while our officers continue to conduct their enquiries.” Simpkins said that police had a man in custody and were not looking for any other suspects in connection with the incident. “We know that a number of people were in the area at around the time of the incident and that there may be more members of the public who may have been approached or assaulted by the suspect,” he said. “If you were approached by the suspect or may have witnessed the incident, I would urge you to get in touch. “Any information you may have could really assist with our investigation.” Anyone with information, or with dashcam or phone footage of the Coventry Road and Gilbert Close area between 7.45am and 8.05am, is being asked to call 101 quoting incident number 91 of April 23.

4/23/2022,"Antony Gormley has hurt his knee, which is a pain in more ways than one. He’s due in Italy in a few days’ time, to install the second of two new shows, and time is too short to be hopping around on crutches. His office is up a flight of external stairs, which are made of metal and get slippery in the rain, so he won’t be coming down again today. Though his assistant apologises that the huge warehouse studio complex downstairs is empty, it doesn’t appear so. Large metal figures, wrapped in plastic, hang from the beams like giant, conceptual bats. In a side room, specialist packers are constructing crates round other pieces, which are about to be shipped off here, there and everywhere. Outside, a couple of cast-iron figures stand in the drizzle, gathering the rust that will be part of their personality when they are sent out into the world. Isn’t there a risk they’ll get stolen? Gormley laughs, and points out that thieves would have to come with some serious heavy-lifting equipment. The two shows, in Venice and in the Tuscan hill town of San Gimignano, will display the little and large of one of the UK’s most industrious sculptors, a knight of the realm, who is beloved for such towering public works as the Angel of the North at Gateshead and Another Place, the 100 figures that have stood on Crosby beach in Merseyside since 2005. But those who feel they know him, because they have been seeing works based on casts of his own lean body for so many decades, may find themselves perplexed by a new body of work that is altogether more theoretical. “This is sort of Rodin’s Thinker on the toilet,” he says, of a cubist construction that will be presented in miniature in Venice and in giant form in San Gimignano. It’s called Stem, he says, as we peer at it on his computer. “You can think of Stem as stemming the flow. Or you can also think of it as a thing that gives support.” Titles are important to him, he adds. He likes singular words that are both definitive nouns and transitive verbs. “I don’t want my titles to be a closing; I want them to create an opening.” As he speaks, he struggles to his feet and hops over to his work table, where a model of another piece has pride of place. It’s called Frame, and is a maze of wires, with a small cutout of a human placed inside to give a sense of its scale, which will be huge. It will occupy the auditorium of an old theatre in San Gimignano. “I want people to look down on it from the boxes as people walk through it, bowing their heads to get in: here the auditorium becomes the place of a performance where art and life interact.” I’m unable to make head nor tail of it until, in one of those extraordinary moments of prestidigitation that sometimes happen in conversations with artists, he explains it into perfect focus. “It’s based on the third position in a Muslim sequence of prayer, where the body is occupying the least possible space: you’re on your knees, your feet flat to the floor, but you haven’t yet touched your forehead to the floor.” Ah yes, suddenly I can see a person at prayer, the human in the apparently abstract. When I tell him I feel anxious about looking at art in miniature and on screen, without seeing the work itself, he reassures me that it’s in keeping with his latest thinking, which is all about the relationship between the human body and architecture and the cyberspace in which we spend so much of our time. “I’m shocked myself when I look at my phone and it tells me my online time has gone from three to seven hours in the last 24. How is that possible?” he frets. “We treat our bodies almost like a dog that we have to take out and exercise and keep under very careful dietary control, rather than living a life of doing and making and engaging. I know that all sounds a bit luddite, but I think it’s just terribly important.” This thought brings him back to Frame. “You have to say: ‘What the hell is this?’ Well, this is me saying: ‘Can we treat the space of the body as a sequence of rooms, as a concatenation of cells?’ But rather than making them solid, I’m going to use the language of space. So it’s a house-sized body. It’s the first time I’m no longer using the dead weight of blocks as the principle of them coming together, but linking them like a chain. And they can all be loose. The head, the arms, the forearms, the back of the legs and the feet are all completely independent, even though they are all connected to each other.” It’s the culmination of half a century of thinking for the 71-year-old artist, who was the youngest of seven children born into the wealthy Catholic family of a pharmaceuticals magnate. He was educated by monks at a Benedictine boarding school, and has said that his parents chose his initials – “AMDG” – to offer their infant son up ad maiorem Dei gloriam (to the greater glory of God). Islam, he says, is so refreshingly uncluttered after the paraphernalia of icons and images that choked up the churches of his childhood. His concern with the mysteries of space and form is evident in early work from his time as a postgraduate at the Slade in the late 1970s. He’s particularly proud of a nest of black bowls (pictured below), an attempt to capture infinity in a droplet of water, which could also be seen as an offertory – or prayer – bowl, a product of his lifelong interest in religion. Before art school, after graduating from Cambridge with a degree in archaeology, anthropology and the history of art, he took himself off to India and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to immerse himself in Buddhism. It has remained a touchstone in his life, though, he says, “Having escaped from Catholicism, I’m reluctant to sign up to anything else.” At the Slade he met Vicken Parsons, now his wife, who is up in the studio, eating lunch with him, but slips quietly out when I arrive. She became his assistant, then his collaborator, and is an artist in her own right. She was responsible for making his body casts, as well as raising their three children. In one early work, involving 600 loaves of bread – Mother’s Pride “because it was a food furthest from the field, part of a distribution network more akin to gas or electricity … it had nothing to do with mothers and very little to do with pride” – Parsons drew outlines of his body on two piles totalling more than 8,000 slices, which he hollowed out by eating the bread. The piece, titled Bed, was shown at London’s Whitechapel Gallery in 1981, the year after the couple got married. “Bed was great for our relationship,” wrote Parsons, “it was exciting building this mad thing together.” The first 20 years of his career were concerned with making lead-covered moulds of his body that, he says, “materialised the inner darkness. Not everyone will see it this way, but this is the truth. And you could say that the ability of them to be interpreted as rather bad statues was the risk I took. And the fact is that they are bad statues if you want them to be statues.” Times change, and he has been criticised for, as one reviewer put it, “leaving representations of this privileged white guy around a world dominated by privileged white guys”. He bats away the charge, insisting that they have nothing to do with idealisation, or the sexualisation of the body. “Nothing to do with portraits, or all of the things to which the statute has to answer. For me they are reflexive instruments: they are saying: ‘Here is something that has captured the lived moment of human time, taking it out of human time and putting it in geological time.’” He loves the damage that weather inflicts – hence the figures standing outside his studio – but he’s also mindful of his legacy, an interest that fortuitously coincides with environmental concerns about waste. Last year, he mounted a heroic rescue effort to restore the Crosby beach figures, some of which had fallen over and were being swept out to sea. “They were put there temporarily. And I think, had they been a permanent installation originally, we would have done it differently. When the people of Merseyside decided they wanted them to stay, I had a responsibility to make sure that they would last longer and we’ve done it now in such a way as they are guaranteed for the next 50 years. And, yes, they are purposefully oxidising, and the forms that are at the mid-point between high and low tide are spectacularly spalling, but the accidents of appearance are not of my concern.” A more human-made threat faced the Angel of the North, when planners decided on a road-widening project that it was feared might obscure the view of what has arguably become the country’s best-loved modern landmark. An application for listed status was turned down on the grounds that it was less than 30 years old. In fact, says Gormley, it has so far worked out rather well for the Angel, removing some of the trees planted at the time of its installation in 1998, which had grown up to obscure the view. “I said to them at the time: ‘The whole point of the Angel is that it sits on a mound that it shares with visitors, which was made from the destroyed pithead buildings of the Lower Tyne colliery.’ The mound says: ‘You know, the Thatcher years annihilated all the collective memory of a 200-year dialogue between coal, iron and engineering.’ I wanted it to be a tribute to that history of pretty hellish working underground.” He is still a regular visitor to Gateshead, where his works are cast. When the foundry he used got into trouble a few years ago, instead of finding another, he bought it up. “We’re nostalgic about the extraordinary sense of community that arises between people when they’re oppressed,” he says. “I don’t know what that says about human nature, but I do know that when I go up to Northumberland, I find people with positive attitudes and the ability to care for each other in a way that just isn’t common.” The affection is mutual. After a year of lockdown, nearly 7,000 people booked timed tickets to Sunderland’s Northern Gallery for Contemporary Art’s reopening show last summer to see Field for the British Isles, an installation of 40,000 tiny clay figures – affectionately known as Gorms – which won him the Turner prize in 1994. But Gormley’s ambitions are far from parochial. Within a year of Field’s first UK outing, he was also exhibiting it in the former Yugoslavian states of Slovenia and Croatia, though an attempt to install it in a burnt-out Holiday Inn in the besieged Bosnian city of Sarajevo was turned down by the Foreign Office. “They said it was immoral to take art when what was needed was food. That’s a very limited view of what is necessary for the spirit,” he said at the time. The rampant nationalism that those early Field trips aimed to counteract, by migrating art across borders and gesturing at a shared world, is sadly on the march again, its destructiveness evident in the silhouettes of ruined tower blocks in Ukraine. “These are now the images we’re receiving from Mariupol,” he says, “our high-density city-dwelling structure revealed to us as a skeleton.” Nor is this hellish scenario the sole preserve of countries at war. The spectacle of Grenfell Tower after the 2017 fire posed similar questions about a way of living that increasingly preoccupies him. Its bleakness is captured in a simple charcoal drawing: “Is this a beehive? Somewhere where our species can live in harmony, and a way of making honey,” he asks.“Or is it a prison that actually becomes the condition of alienation and despair?” Though drawings and sketchbooks are part of what he now exhibits, he remains primarily a sculptor, on a mission to interrogate the whole purpose of sculpture. “People are still obsessed with images and finding things they can recognise,” he says. “And what am I doing? Well, I’m inviting people to explore the conditions of their own living. It’s a big risk, and it may or may not work. But I guess everything in my exhibitions is a test site for asking three questions: what can sculpture do? Can we make it in a different way? And what is an exhibition anyway?” The title of the San Gimignano show is Body Space Time. “Three short words which I think say it all.” Small Stem Model (2019)“This is Rodin’s Thinker on the toilet, with its head dropped on to its folded arms. It was a huge evolution for me. I’ve never made something so absolute. In the Venice show it’s a small graphite model; in San Gimignano it’s lifesize, and it had to be accurate to 200ths of a millimetre. This is me trying to materialise the internal space of the body in the language of architecture. This is where I am now in the work – but that idea of mapping the inner space of the body has been in the work for a long time.” Grenfell II (2017)“I felt that what happened to Grenfell Tower was such a tragic story of human greed and laziness and wishful thinking. But it was also about the absolute opposite: an extraordinary community, with its artists, social workers, nurses and teachers. When you saw it from the Westway after the fire it was a black outline, not dissimilar from my charcoal drawing, asking the same questions my sculptures ask: is this the condition in which we live? Is this now our habitat?” Full Bowl (1977-78)“This is a hand-sized bowl I made at art school, which still makes me think. It’s filled with smaller bowls and seems to ripple out, like water. It’s a conceptual work, but the thing that excites me is that in the middle is a void: an empty bowl, surrounded, as it were, by space at large. It’s exploring the unreliability of edges. In other words, where something begins and ends is maybe delusionary.” Subject III (2021)“Now that over 50% of our species lives within the urban grid, we are implicit in and dependent upon our context. So this is a body in a position of supplication, though it isn’t actually praying. I think it is saying that we are now supplicants within an organisation of the world that is in our computers, our digital technology, as well as in the axial grid of our cities, and the horizontal and vertical planes of our architecture.” Frame II (2022)This model consists of a maze of wires, with a small cutout of a human placed inside to give a sense of its scale. The full-size version will occupy the auditorium of an old theatre in San Gimignano. “I want people to look down on it from the boxes as people walk through it, bowing their heads to get in,” says Gormley. “Here the auditorium becomes the place of a performance where art and life interact.” Body Space Time is at Galleria Continua, San Gimignano, until 5 September.

4/23/2022,"The theatre company Punchdrunk has expanded what’s possible on stage – and spawned many immersive imitators. All the while, it’s reinvented classic texts in strange settings, merging theatre, dance, film and installation art, and leaving audiences dazzled and unsettled … and tired from all that walking around. Its latest is The Burnt City, based around the Trojan war, staged at its new London HQ. Among the Punchdrunk oeuvre is It Felt Like a Kiss, a work for the 2009 Manchester international festival, made with Adam Curtis and Damon Albarn. At the 2007 MIF, Albarn joined with Chinese director Chen Shi-Zheng to stage the fantastical opera meets “rock’n’roll circus”, Monkey: Journey to the West. Chen Shi-Zheng’s film debut was the little-seen Dark Matter from 2007, starring Meryl Streep, Aidan Quinn and Liu Ye. In his 1980s-hunk era, Quinn starred in Susan Seidelman’s “cult feminist classic” Desperately Seeking Susan. Smithereens, the 1982 debut from Seidelman – who later directed the Sex and the City pilot – is also worth a look, with musician Richard Hell as a scuzzy hunk. Hell was once married to the singer Patty Smyth. Not to be confused with the Patti Smith, poet-punk, who dated Hell’s one-time Television bandmate Tom Verlaine. Patti later married Fred “Sonic” Smith of MC5, while an entirely different Fred Smith took up the bass in Television after Hell quit. Patty Smyth is married to John McEnroe from the tennis. A confusing set of mixed doubles. McEnroe was previously married to Tatum O’Neal, who won a best supporting actress Oscar for Paper Moon aged 10. At that 1974 ceremony, Glenda Jackson won her second gong for best actress. An early role for the future Labour MP was in Marat/Sade – the source text was also suitable fodder for a 2005 Punchdrunk production. Jackson, meanwhile, played Lady Macbeth on Broadway in 1988, and continuing the theme, the Scottish play provided the basis for Punchdrunk’s Sleep No More, one of its most celebrated shows.

4/23/2022,"Valerie Solanas is famous for two things: shooting Andy Warhol and writing the SCUM (Society for Cutting Up Men) Manifesto, perhaps the most wilfully outrageous radical feminist polemic. Initially self-published and sold by her on the streets of New York in 1967, it called upon “responsible, thrill-seeking females to overthrow the government… institute complete automation and eliminate the male sex”. The book gained its initial notoriety after Solanas’s attempted assassination of Warhol at his studio, the Factory, on 3 June 1968. Having handed herself in to the police hours after the shooting, she was charged with attempted murder, and later sentenced to three years for “reckless assault with intent to harm” after being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After her arrest, she reputedly told a reporter: “Read my manifesto and it will tell you what I am.” Ever since, Solanas, who died in 1988, has occupied a singular and complex place in the cultural landscape, her manifesto hailed by some feminist scholars as a visionary text and her story inspiring several plays and an acclaimed art film, I Shot Andy Warhol. Now comes a new book from 52-year-old American photographer Justine Kurland, best known for her 2020 series, Girl Pictures, portraying young women in the American wilds. Her intriguingly titled SCUMB Manifesto pays homage to the wildly transgressive spirit of Solanas, whom she describes in the book as “a revolutionary, a panhandler, prostitute and vagabond, insane, brilliant and very funny”. SCUMB stands for Society for Cutting Up Men’s Books, which is exactly what Kurland has done, dismembering and reconfiguring images from around 150 photobooks by white, male photographers. All of the books were from Kurland’s own shelves. They include Stephen Shore’s American Surfaces, William Eggleston’s Los Alamos, Larry Clark’s Tulsa, Martin Parr’s Think of England, Alec Soth’s Sleeping By the Mississippi, Brassaï’s Paris By Night and, most famous of all, Robert Frank’s The Americans. Each collage is named after the book that provided the raw material for it, but does not refer to the photographer in question. Before exhibiting 65 of the SCUMB collages in a Brooklyn gallery last year, Kurland offered each of them to the individual photographers whose work she had cut up and reassembled. “I sent out emails saying, ‘I’ve been making collages out of photobooks and here’s yours’,” she says, laughing over the phone from her studio in New York. Most of them did not respond. Of those who did, she tells me, Tod Papageorge said he was flattered, Stephen Shore offered to do a trade for a print and Jim Goldberg sent her a copy of his book Raised By Wolves, to use as raw material, but, she says, “some others had less of a sense of humour and were offended by the work”. This is hardly surprising given that her collages not only challenge the patriarchy but also raise issues around authorship and respect. “I’m not targeting anyone,” she says. “It’s about a system and structures of power, not individuals, though I have to say, some of these guys have been taking up too much room for too long.” She ended up selling the early collages for $900 (£690) each, mostly to her students, though the Museum of Modern Art in New York also snapped up several. A selection, created from Lee Friedlander’s series Nudes are currently on display at the Herald Gallery in London as part of a group show, Say Less. If SCUMB Manifesto is a gleefully provocative assault on photography’s patriarchal history, it is also an act of wonderfully intricate creativity: the collages possess a vivid, often viscerally powerful life of their own. Kurland’s style ranges from the playfully surreal – Parr’s signature English character studies reconfigured as a melange of artfully arranged limbs, vegetables, flowers and faces, to the coolly minimal – Friedlander’s America By Car rendered as a Ballardian swirl of steering wheels. Often, the original photographs have been so transformed that you may struggle, as I did, to identify the photographer whose images she has reworked. She upends Robert Adams’s rigorously formal detachment and renders Brassaï’s nocturnal Paris unrecognisable by cutting up and rearranging details of his photographs – a cobbled street, a cafe tabletop, fabrics – as ominous monochrome geometric shapes. Elsewhere, her subversion is more pointedly political. The female body, as fetishised by photographers such as Helmut Newton and Guy Bourdin, is rendered by turns sculptural, dreamlike and disturbing in works that float free of the voyeuristic male gaze while drawing attention to its voraciousness. The inclusion of renowned photographers such as Brassaï and Frank will no doubt be considered an act of cultural vandalism by some but that, too, is part of Kurland’s provocation. The angriest element of the book is the front cover, in which Kurland draws on Solanas’s ferociously combative and accusatory prose style to stick it to the patriarchy. Over a blood red collage of writhing female nudes, she states: “I, Justine Kurland, am SCUMB. I thrive in the stagnant waste of your boring photography. I bubble up, a raw life force, multiplying from the useless excrement of your misogynistic books.” Her screed ends with the mock-threatening line: “I’m coming for you with my blade.” In its confrontational tone, it does promise more than it delivers given that, throughout, her scalpel is more a tool of intricate reconfiguration than violent dismemberment. “I started out thinking it would be a purely punk act of destruction, but really it’s the most delicate, fussy medium,” says Kurland, “I spent hours and hours making these meticulous, lacy cuts and then carefully putting them together. It’s about the glue as well as the scissors. For me, it is a reparative act rather than a destructive one.” Kurland has been making photographs since she was 15. She studied at Yale in the late 1990s under Gregory Crewdson, a photographer known for his elaborately staged cinematic tableaux, one of which she reworks in her book. The collages are a dramatic shift in tone and approach from her previous work, which explored, and subverted, a certain kind of American frontier romanticism. Her book Highway Kind (2016) was made on a series of epic road trips she took across the country in a beat-up camper van, often with her young children in tow. Girl Pictures (2020) comprised images she made between 1997 and 2002, in which her young, rebellious female subjects appear to inhabit an almost utopian world of freedom in nature. Kurland’s shift from photography to collage was precipitated by a conjunction of events, personal and cultural: the death of her father, the seismic political and social upheavals of the past few years and a kind of moral reckoning with her own way of working. “In a way, my road trips bought into an enduring idea in American photography, which is that you go out into the world and bring the news back home,” she says. “It felt like a holdover from the colonial impulse and I started to feel a little uncomfortable with that. I think that was when I started to feel really ambivalent about the way I was working.” While not as transgressive as other acts of creative defacement – the Chapman brothers drawing clown heads on a rare edition of Goya etchings springs immediately to mind – SCUMB Manifesto is certainly a well-aimed missive at what Kurland calls “the male photography canon and its monopoly on meaning and value”. Photography is still, to a degree, a male-dominated medium, particularly as regards the often nerdy obsessive world of photobook collecting but, creatively, that monopoly is being challenged on many fronts, not least by an abundance of contemporary female photographers, curators and artist-activists. There is no doubt it has held sway for too long, though, with groundbreaking photographers such as Berenice Abbott, Gerda Taro and Germaine Krull, to name just three groundbreaking women, still not as celebrated as their male counterparts. “The history of photography is filled with women,” as Kurland puts it, “so there is no excuse or justification for their exclusion.” For now, she tells me, collage is a way to “explore the ambivalence” she feels about the medium in which she established her reputation. Will she go back to photography? “You never know,” she says. “It’s a big hot mess in my head and I haven’t really formulated it yet. I love photography, and photobooks have been a path towards what I do in my work, but when I realised that 99% of the ones in my collection were by straight, white males, it disturbed me.

4/23/2022,"An inquiry into how under-18s who question their gender identity are treated by the NHS is to be launched by the UK government, according to reports. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, is said to be concerned that vulnerable children are being given gender hormone treatment before alternatives have been explored, according to the Times, and is planning an overhaul of services. It comes after an interim report published last month by the Cass Review, an independent review into the NHS’s gender identity services for children and young people. The review said services have “evolved rapidly and organically” in response to increased demand, but that that has meant they have “not been subjected to some of the normal quality controls” typically applied to new treatments. It added that there is a “lack of consensus and open discussion about the nature of gender dysphoria and therefore about the appropriate clinical response”. Javid is said to have compared political sensitivities around the treatment of young people with gender dysphoria to those that stymied investigations into the Rotherham grooming gangs, the Times reported. Asked about the issue in the Commons this week, Javid said the interim findings of the Cass Review had already shown that NHS services “are too narrow … , overly affirmative, and in fact … are bordering on ideological”. “That is why in this emerging area, of course we need to be absolutely sensitive, but we need to make sure that there is holistic care that is provided, that there’s not a one-way street, and that all medical interventions are based on the best clinical evidence,” he said. There is currently a single specialist service – the Gender Identity Development Service, run by the Tavistock and Portman NHS foundation trust – providing gender identity services for children and young people. The service sees about 2,500 children a year, about 200 of whom are given some form of hormone treatment. In September, the court of appeal upheld the right of the trust to give puberty-blocking drugs to under-16s judged to be mature enough to give informed consent. The report noted that a lack of “routine and consistent” data about who is being referred for treatment means it is “not possible to accurately track” outcomes. A spokesperson for trust told the Times: “Being respectful of someone’s identity does not preclude exploration. “We agree that support should be holistic, based on the best available evidence, and that no assumptions should be made about the right outcome for any given young person.” The Guardian has approached the Department of Health and Social Care for comment.",News/World news,Javid orders inquiry into NHS gender identity services for under-18s – reports,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/javid-orders-inquiry-into-nhs-gender-identity-services-for-under-18s-reports
4/23/2022,"Boris Johnson has been told public fury at lockdown-breaking Downing Street parties will result in the Conservatives suffering substantial losses at next month’s local elections, with the possibility that the prime minister may receive further police fines ahead of polling day. Steve Baker, a prominent backbench Tory MP, said voters were repeatedly mentioning the Partygate scandal on the campaign trail and the Conservatives should prepare to “reap the whirlwind” of standing by Johnson. The former Brexit minister, who called for Johnson to quit earlier this week, told the Daily Telegraph it was clear the prime minister was not sincere when he apologised to parliament for breaking lockdown rules, adding: “The problem is the contrition didn’t last much longer than it took to get out of the headmaster’s study. By the time we got to the 1922 Committee meeting that evening it was the usual festival of bombast and orgy of adulation. It took me about 90 seconds to realise he wasn’t really remorseful.” He said members of the cabinet who want the prime minister gone are “sitting there fat, dumb and happy and letting me do the dirty work” rather than risk their careers by publicly trying to force Johnson out of office. The Guardian has reported how MPs believe allies of Tory MPs such as Penny Mordaunt and Jeremy Hunt are already making preparations for leadership bids. Baker has represented Wycombe since 2010 but his seat is now a key target for Labour, with current polling suggesting Sir Keir Starmer’s party would win the constituency if an election was held tomorrow. “People lived under barbaric rules,” Baker said. “They were told that if they deviated one iota from the law they would kill people. And they suffered for it … Meanwhile in No 10, where they should have been obeying both the letter and spirit of the rules, clearly they breached both.” It comes after a report by ITV News said fixed-penalty notices had been emailed to officials who attended a “bring your own booze” drinks event in the Downing Street garden in May 2020 at a time when indoor and outdoor gatherings were banned. Downing Street said on Friday evening that Johnson, who has admitted attending the garden party but insisted he “believed implicitly that this was a work event”, has not received notice of a fine in relation to the gathering. But with the prime minister having already been fined once for attending his own birthday event in June 2020, there is the risk he could be fined further times, with claims that police are looking into another five possible rule-breaking events he is said to have attended. The Met has said it will make no public updates on the number of fines issued until after the local elections. However, Downing Street has stated it will still announce if the prime minister receives further fines in the lead up to polling day. In addition to a police probe and an investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gray, the PM will be subject to a third inquiry by the House of Commons privileges committee about the Partygate scandal. It will seek to determine whether he knew about the alleged rule breaches before making his statements to MPs. An attempt to block this third investigation failed this week, amid a backbench rebellion. Facing questions about the alleged parties during his final day in India on Friday, the prime minister said he would still be in power in the autumn, having set the target of signing a trade deal with New Delhi by October.",News/Politics,"Tories face heavy local election losses over Partygate, PM told",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/23/tories-face-heavy-local-election-losses-over-partygate-pm-told
4/23/2022,"The swan-swastika banners, boots and guns in the Royal Opera’s 2018 staging of Wagner’s Lohengrin, though brilliantly done, had an air of theatrical platitude when new. Now back for its first revival, with an outstanding, watertight cast conducted by Jakub Hrůša, David Alden’s production has sharp immediacy. Empty facades of burnt-out buildings, which previously resembled bleak but elegant examples of constructivism in Paul Steinberg’s designs, now reflect the images we see daily in the news. A herald in leg brace, face bloodied, holds up a mirror to our tarnished world. Lohengrin (1850), a transitional work for Wagner in his long journey towards The Ring and Parsifal, is set against a backdrop of war. That tumult recedes in the face of the tangled principal relationships, chief among them Elsa von Brabant (Jennifer Davis, returning to the role in gleaming voice) and her saviour-hero of the title, performed with expressive range, and no fear of singing softly, by Brandon Jovanovich. As a knight of the holy grail, he is obliged to travel by swan boat. Nor must he reveal his name, even to his understandably frustrated new wife. He arrives as Elsa’s liberator, the city walls splitting open at the breathtaking climax of Act 1, to a flutter of wings (video by Tal Rosner) suggesting a swan in flight. Out steps the mysterious knight, into this war zone, an outsider in loose white linen suit (cast your mind back to the BBC correspondent Martin Bell entering Bosnia). Lohengrin, however, is an aggressor too, showing an aptitude for violence when he and Elsa tumble on the marital bed, and willing to kill his grisly opponent Telramund. When the stranger finally speaks his name, it is, in every sense and after four hours of high-intensity opera and many blazing, onstage trumpet fanfares, curtains. The vital crowd scenes in Lohengrin act as interruptions, sonically and dramatically, to the dominant exchange between the the lead couple and their pagan opponents, Ortrud and Telramund – the explosive and steely Anna Smirnova and Craig Colclough, powerfully efficient as her murky accomplice. On Tuesday’s first night, the choral outbursts had particular urgency and attack, strenuous high tenor lines belted out with accuracy, tone and assurance, a wall of glorious sound hitting the back of the auditorium. This is a chorus in peak form. Alden’s direction (revived by Peter Relton) is meticulously choreographed, not only for the multitudes but in the movement of each individual, patterned by position on stage and use of colour (red, white, black, emphasised by Adam Silverman’s lighting and use of shadow). This stylised approach could have been stifling. Instead, it helped clarify. Gábor Bretz as the weak king and Derek Welton, luxury casting as Herald, led a strong supporting ensemble. Hrůša’s perceptive conducting ignited red-hot playing from the ROH orchestra, violins digging into their strings as if electrically charged, clarinet and oboe eloquent in solos, brass on fire and willing to risk safety. This is not the best of Wagner, but it was Lohengrin at its best. Applying the lightest touch, the team of composer Errollyn Wallen, with director Jenny Sealey and co-librettists Selina Mills and Nicola Werenowska, have created a cabaret-style opera about the life of Maria Theresia von Paradis. This Austrian musician and contemporary of Mozart lost her sight as a child, and was subjected to invasive cures and unwanted sexual attentions. Wallen’s innovative work has been staged by Graeae theatre company, founded in 1980 to champion deaf, disabled and neurodivergent talent. The opera’s central relationship is between Paradis and her mother, the Baroness, who sees only her daughter’s shortcomings, not her extraordinary gifts. The Paradis Files skips through Theresia’s story, a mix of fact and fiction, in quick scenes, using six singers and five musicians who perform Wallen’s airy score, a kaleidoscope of 18th-century riffs and catchy, pop-style rhythms. The music offers vocal scope to Bethan Langford, outstanding in the central role, with Maureen Braithwaite, as her mother, and Ella Taylor, as the maid Gerda, leading the cast. With onstage signing as part of the action, and wittily designed surtitles, The Paradis Files ensures that a new audience has a chance to experience opera.

4/23/2022,"Awell-stocked trophy cabinet and a storied past give many of Formula One’s teams a rich heritage but on race day old glories count for nothing. History is rightly respected but it does not buy lap time. McLaren, one of F1’s most successful teams, know this only too well. This season, as optimism for success fell apart in devastating fashion, they face an uphill struggle to prove they really are ready to rejoin the top table. McLaren have assuredly already earned their honours. Only Ferrari have competed in F1 for longer and only Ferrari are more successful. Since Bruce McLaren made his team’s debut in 1966 at Monaco they have won 12 drivers’ and eight constructors’ titles. From 909 races they have won 183, numbers that have made them synonymous with F1. They are the tallies of which other teams can only dream. Yet the glory days have seemed a distant memory for some time. The team last challenged for a championship in 2012. An engine partnership with Honda proved disastrous and they fell to ninth place in 2015 and 2017. The fightback has been long and hard but it has been successful. Until now. Last season Daniel Ricciardo won at Monza, albeit aided by Max Verstappen ending his own and Lewis Hamilton’s race, but it was indicative of how competitive McLaren were. On an upward curve, they had placed third in the 2020 constructors’ championship, with Ferrari struggling. Lando Norris, who completed the one-two with Ricciardo in Monza, also took four podiums last season. This year with the new regulations there was genuine belief McLaren could threaten the big three. At the season opener in Bahrain those hopes were shattered. Norris and Ricciardo qualified in 13th and 18th respectively, and finished in 15th and 14th. McLaren’s new dawn faded under the harsh glare of Sakhir’s floodlights. Their real form was not as bad as Bahrain suggested, an outlier compounded by losing time in testing, but they are far from where they want to be. For Norris, the 22-year-old British driver who joined the team in 2019 when they had already implemented major change and whose results were reflecting McLaren’s clear progress, their start to the season has been a sucker punch – the hardest to deal with of his career, he revealed in Imola. “This year we had the most expectation and we underdelivered the most,” he said. “I felt like I was doing the best I have done and not feeling like we are getting the reward. The last two seasons we were rewarded when things went perfectly, now it is only a fifth or seventh even if it is perfect.” Fifth is their best result so far and that came in Australia where the track suited their car and a Red Bull and a Ferrari failed to finish. But, as Norris acknowledged, they are up to as much as second a lap off both those two leading teams. Norris was in good spirits in the paddock at Imola despite his stern introduction to just how fickle a mistress F1 can be but he is not enjoying the experience. “This was a chance for us to take a bigger step up than we have in the past four years,” he said. “To not have done is so frustrating, I want to win, I want to be on the podium and when you drop away from that it’s frustrating.” The car lacks downforce, an issue that will not be solved overnight. Norris cites “months” of work ahead making incremental steps but the team are convinced the car is fundamentally sound. Zak Brown instituted structural and cultural changes when he became chief executive in 2018. James Key, the technical director who joined in 2019, described a fundamental tenet of “being very open with stuff and removing the blame cultures so people were free to talk and attack issues in a very sort of mature and open way”. Norris, who has always been an exponent of building strong relationships within the team, of encouragement and motivation, believes McLaren can weather this storm. “There has not been any pointing fingers, or blame on whose fault it is,” he said. “There is none of that, they are motivated and excited to come up with ideas, everyone is working together which is what you want to see in times like these.” Crucially Andreas Seidl, the team principal, praises the positive attitude of his drivers and their staunch determination in the face of disappointment. The German insists his team remain focused on their plan to challenge for wins over a three-year period as they build their infrastructure, including a wind tunnel. “This was the first test of everything we have put in place the last two or three years,” he said. “I am very happy with how the entire team dealt with that challenge, the most important thing was to stay calm, that was my responsibility with Lando and Daniel, to analyse what happened, where we are and use the disappointment and switch it into motivation, to put a plan in place.” These are without doubt testing times for McLaren and as ever, history looms large over their efforts. It is both reminder and spur but no more than that. McLaren know it is the future that matters, the focus now on turning their fortunes around.",Sport/Sport,McLaren are off the F1 pace – can their plan deliver the speed they need? | Giles Richards,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/23/mclaren-are-well-off-the-f1-pace-but-must-focus-on-the-future-to-find-a-fix
4/23/2022,"Gary Kirsten is likely to be on the shortlist for the vacant role of the England Test head coach as Rob Key moves to make his first major appointment as director of men’s cricket. A job that could be split into two by way of Test and white-ball cricket is due to be officially advertised in the coming days, but Key has already begun sounding out potential candidates since starting his job last Tuesday. Kirsten, the former India and South Africa head coach, missed out on the England job in 2019 to Chris Silverwood and was left bruised by a process that led to him flying to the UK under a belief it was his to lose. But those close to Kirsten say he remains keen on the challenge of reversing England’s Test fortunes and, having had concerns over the demands on family life when the job was all-format, is encouraged by the role potentially being split. Speaking about Kirsten in February when a pundit for Sky, Key said: “He probably would [be a good option as head coach]. He was obviously a decent player and he’s got a lot of international cricket experience, so he’s used to that scrutiny and he coached India to No 1 in the world with [captain] MS Dhoni. “What you have to work out with these people at times is who was the real driver of that success that India had. Was it MS Dhoni, was it Gary Kirsten? Did Gary Kirsten just facilitate MS Dhoni and everything that was great about MS Dhoni and all the decisions? That’s what you have to find out.” Kirsten is the batting mentor to the new Gujarat Titans franchise that sits second in the Indian Premier League but with England keen to secure the right person for the team’s needs, a degree of flexibility over second jobs has not been ruled out. There are others in contention, with the former Australia batter Simon Katich highly rated by Key after their recent stint commentating together in Pakistan. The 46-year-old already works in England as the head coach of Manchester Originals, has county knowledge from his playing days and past coaching experience in the IPL. Though splitting the head coach roles reduces time on the road, candidates will still have to weigh up their own commitments and the lifestyle of international cricket. Katich, for example, has a young family and is among a number of former players who enjoy the flexibility of combining commentary work with short-term franchise roles. Key is said to be optimistic about his options, with Graham Ford, the well-travelled former Kent and Surrey coach, another named linked and Paul Collingwood, the interim head coach for both legs of the recent Caribbean tour, a candidate for the limited-overs job that supports Eoin Morgan as captain. Justin Langer, the former Australia head coach, is not thought to be a contender. While Ben Stokes is also expected to take on the Test captaincy – provided Key is convinced the all-rounder is ready for additional responsibility after last year’s break for mental health reasons – a trickier task comes in hiring a new national selector. Key is preparing to restore the position after it was made redundant by his predecessor, Ashley Giles, last year. It is hoped the new Test head coach will start before the three-match series against New Zealand in June but finding the right selector – a that involves management of the scouting network – could take longer.",Sport/Sport,Former India head coach Gary Kirsten keen on England Test job,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/23/former-india-head-coach-gary-kirsten-keen-on-england-cricket-test-job
4/23/2022,"Arsenal. They are one point behind Chelsea with both sides having played 18 games but their remaining four fixtures are, on paper at least, more winnable than those of their rivals. Intriguingly Tottenham will have a big say in the title race. While Chelsea play them on Sunday and then again on Thursday, the north London derby takes place on Wednesday 4 May. Although Chelsea should win at Birmingham on 1 May, their tricky concluding home game of the campaign comes against a Manchester United side challenging Manchester City for third place – and the final Champions League slot. Things seem more straightforward for Arsenal’s manager, Jonas Eidevall: after Sunday’s trip to Everton, Arsenal are home to Aston Villa and Spurs before visiting West Ham on the final day. Convincing. Chelsea are seeking a sixth straight WSL win on Sunday and Arsenal a fifth. League defeats are rare for both clubs: Arsenal have lost only one all season, Chelsea are furious with themselves for suffering two. Perhaps significantly, one of those reverses came when they went down 3-2 at Arsenal in September. Earlier this month though Chelsea exacted revenge by prevailing 2-0 in an FA Cup semi-final at their title rivals’ Borehamwood home. Chelsea’s Emma Hayes, albeit only slightly. The 45-year-old manager has won the WSL four times with Chelsea, most recently last spring. Having succeeded Joe Montemurro at Arsenal last summer, Eidevall is experiencing his first season in England. Not that he is exactly a novice: the 39-year-old Swede won the Damallsvenskan three times during his time in charge of Rosengard. During her decade in west London Hayes has constantly refreshed her squad and evolved tactically. This season Chelsea have shifted from a 4-2-3-1 formation to 3-4-3 and become more focused on possession. Hayes cut her coaching teeth in the US and her in-depth study of sports science-led conditioning techniques in Chicago, New York and Washington DC have served her well. Chelsea’s fitness programme is designed to ensure players gradually grow stronger as the season unfolds before hitting optimal shape and peak form in time for strong spring finishes. Given that players tend to have reached only 60-70% of their maximum fitness levels in September it represents a slightly risky tactic but the Chelsea manager’s aversion to staging small-sided practice games during early season training has helped minimise soft-tissue injuries. Helpfully, Hayes’s assistant, the former Bristol City manager Tanya Oxtoby, is a qualified sports psychologist, and so far at least they have succeeded in preventing the uncertainty surrounding their club’s sale from exerting an emotional toll on the pitch. In some ways, Eidevall has taken Arsenal in the opposite direction as he endeavours to end his club’s three-year trophy drought. They have become much more direct, creating more goals from wide areas than during Montemurro’s tenure and often play 4-4-2. Bolstered by a quintet of key summer signings, Arsenal started the season in unstoppable form by winning their first six league matches but arguably drew too many games during a winter complicated by the two-month absence of their influential defender Leah Williamson, who injured a hamstring. With Eidevall’s marquee summer signing, the US forward Tobin Heath, also often short of fitness and Nikita Parris struggling for form after signing from Lyon, their momentum slowed mid-season, allowing Chelsea to catch up. Chelsea boast the WSL’s leading scorer in Australia’s Sam Kerr who is on 16 goals but Arsenal’s ever-dangerous Vivianne Miedema is on 12. Beth Mead, too, is enjoying an excellent campaign on the right wing and has scored eight times for Arsenal. They and Chelsea possess two of the league’s finest central defenders in Williamson and Millie Bright, with that pair integral to the teams’ respective title challenges. Hayes would be happier were England’s attacking playmaker Fran Kirby not sidelined by fatigue issues. Chelsea have attacking strength in depth, however, and her absence has at least offered Beth England a chance to remind everyone of the talent which saw her named the PFA women’s player of the season two years ago. England has scored seven WSL goals, reinforcing her claims for a place in the Lionesses’s Euro 2022 squad. Similarly Eidevall had hoped the double World Cup winner Heath would shine in Arsenal’s attack but injuries have restricted the 33-year-old to a handful of starts during a frustrating campaign in which she is yet to complete a single 90 minutes. But the impact of Heath’s travails has been minimised by the arrival of Sweden’s Stina Blackstenius from BK Hacken in January, and the subsequent formation of her menacing partnership with Miedema.",Sport/Football,Arsenal or Chelsea?

4/23/2022,"Such is England’s dominance of the Women’s Six Nations that the greatest challenge each player faces is earning a spot in the starting lineup. In every position Simon Middleton’s side possess two or three world-class talents capable of walking into any other side in the world. But no competition is as hotly contested as the one under way at fly-half. On Sunday Zoe Harrison will wear No 10 on her back against Ireland but it could just as easily be Helena Rowland, who starts at 15. Both play fly-half, for Saracens and Loughborough Lightning respectively, but each of them brings a different approach to the role. The 24-year-old Harrison is the traditional 10. Cool under pressure, accurate when kicking out of hand, she organises the line with military precision. Rowland, at 22, is the fleet-footed, side-stepping pivot who breaks the play open with a drop of her hip. Understandably, both chafe against the idea that their games can be so neatly pigeonholed. “I think it’s been overdone and it’s not entirely true,” says Harrison. “[Rowland] is a great stepper. But she can control things as well. She’s not one-dimensional at all and our kicking game is pretty similar.” Rowland also pushes back. “I think it’s potentially lazy, maybe, but I understand why people do it,” she says. “Zoe can run and step. I’ve seen her open things up by straightening the line. The more we train together, the more we play together, the more we develop our games. I’m constantly asking her about what she’s better at and she’s the same with me. We help each other. That can only be good for the team.” The pair came together as young girls at Welwyn Rugby Club. The Hertfordshire club have produced nine England players, including the prop Hannah Botterman. But even at such a productive talent factory, Rowland and Harrison stood out. “It’s no surprise to hear this but it was obvious early on that they’d be England internationals,” says Jonathan Cirkel, Welwyn’s girls coordinator. “Helena always had that pace and step and Zoe was pure class. But more than their talent they worked hard. Both of them would stay longer and work on their kicking and could both kick goals from the touchline, which is a rare thing in the girl’s game. They were always asking questions, wanting to get better. There’s a reason they are where they are. We’re so proud of what they’ve done but no one is surprised.” They were united again in the inaugural Premier 15s competition in 2017 where they played leading roles in guiding Saracens to the final. In Ealing, alongside seven other Welwyn graduates including club captain Lotte Clapp, Rowland kicked two conversions and Harrison started at 10 in 24-20 win over Harlequins. “That was special,” Harrison recalls. “We were so young. It felt like we’d be playing together for a long time.” Before the 2018-19 season, Rowland joined Great Britain’s sevens programme in an effort to compete at the Tokyo Olympics. When the Games were postponed due to Covid-19, the sevens squad had their funding cut and Rowland returned to the 15s side. When she did, both Harrison and herself knew that they had a fight on their hands. “When she came back, there were a few games when she started at 10 and I was benched,” Harrison remembers. “I’m not going to lie, that stung. It’s the position where I play my best rugby. I wanted it. It forced me to up my game.” Unlike Harrison, Rowland is not picky when it comes to the number on her back. “I just want to be in the starting XV,” she says. “The way we play, 12 is like a second 10 anyway. I think other people on the outside make a bigger deal of it than it actually is. Wherever the coaches think I can do a job I’ll play there.” Perhaps that is why Harrison now looks firmly in control of this trumped-up contest. Their two contrasting philosophies over this mythologised position also suggests that Harrison is the safe bet come the World Cup final in November in New Zealand. “I’m bossier than Helena is, and I think that’s an important trait for a fly-half,” Harrison says. “You need to take control, be a leader. I’m not saying Helena can’t do that, but it comes more naturally to me. “Look at the match stats for a fly-half. They’re often not impressive. But they’re the conductors. You need to be a bit bossy to tell people where to go and how to play. That’s a skill you can learn. My brother [the former Wasps full-back Alex] and my dad [John, who played for Wales Schools] helped me develop that.” That is not to say that this duel has run its course. “To have the 10 jersey in a World Cup final would be amazing,” Rowland says. She hasn’t given up on that dream just yet.",Sport/Sport,Friendly battle for the No 10 shirt has England’s women flying,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/23/friendly-battle-for-the-no-10-shirt-has-englands-women-flying
