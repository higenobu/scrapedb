2/8/2022,"Late on Saturday night in Edinburgh’s Old Town as we walked back to our hotel, the strains of a familiar tune floated past on the chill, gusty breeze. In the pub around the corner they were still having a grand old time and a loud rendition of “Take Me Home, Country Roads” was in full swing. Travelling revellers, fellowship, simple pleasures: if you were to bottle the essence of the Six Nations it was right there. The opening weekend of rugby was enjoyable, too, give or take the inclement weather. The grounds were sold out and the singing of the anthems was as heartfelt as ever. There were record viewing figures on French television, with seven million apparently tuning in to watch the end of Sunday’s game against Italy. The Monday papers were full of lively follow-up and round two cannot come around quickly enough.  So the obvious question is this: how would you improve the men’s championship from here? Not in the parochial I-hope-our-lot-win sense but for the greater good. More teams? Fewer teams? Teams from the southern hemisphere? More John Denver? Or make no changes at all? Right now is the ideal moment to revisit the debate, with sodden clothes still drying and memories of a classic weekend still fresh. Let us start with the annual conversation about Italy, currently on 33 successive Six Nations defeats and counting. The former British & Irish Lions captain Sam Warburton, speaking on the BBC’s revamped Rugby Special, reiterated his view that the “glass ceiling” protecting the Azzurri from dropping out of the championship and being replaced by, say, Georgia would not be permitted in any other forward-thinking business or industry. Then again, maybe Warburton should have checked out the weekend results from the Rugby Europe Championship. In Tbilisi on Sunday, in front of a far-from-capacity crowd, Georgia were held to a surprise 25-25 draw by Portugal. The Portuguese deserved it, too, their sharpness out wide cancelling out Georgia’s close-quarter strength. It was the first time Georgia have not won a game in the second-tier competition since 2017. Interesting, no? What a story it would be if Portugal go all the way and top the table next month. Or Romania, Spain or Russia for that matter. And imagine if such a victory were a passport to a Six Nations play-off against the bottom-placed Six Nations side? Are we sure there would be limited televisual value and public interest? If it were marketed properly across Europe and broadcast on a free-to-air channel, the viewing figures would surely be significant. Three, two, one … here come the naysayers. Ask the treasurers of Italy and Wales and they will roll their eyes, clutch their chests and warn of financial oblivion should the “cosy club” be revamped. The Six Nations hierarchy will also quietly remind you it is a privately run competition. They can invite – or retain – whoever they want. Diluting the quality of the tournament is in no one’s interests. But hang on. What about South Africa? Such is the financial clout of the Six Nations that adding the Springboks to the mix is regarded, in Johannesburg and Cape Town at least, as a no-brainer. Why would the Europeans not want the world champions supping at the top table and potentially enriching the rugby, the wine list and the weather? With the private equity firm CVC apparently talking to SA Rugby, having already invested in northern hemisphere competitions, the money might be persuasive as well. So what should happen next? A couple of immediate points need stressing. Simply axing Italy and reverting to the Five Nations would be a calamitous admission of collective failure. The Six Nations would also instantly surrender any claim to being a beacon of integrity and fair play if South Africa are suddenly fast-tracked with the rest of Europe still ostracised. The Boks, if they wish to enter, should debut in the second-tier tournament and fight their way up on merit. In that event, could the following be a feasible scenario? Step forward the Seven Nations, commencing in 2024. It would comprise the current six nations plus the winner of the 2023 Rugby Europe title. Thereafter there would be an annual promotion/relegation play-off, instantly breathing fresh hope into rugby across the continent. In 2025 it might be Georgia or Italy v South Africa in Tbilisi or Rome. The following year, who knows? The Seven Nations, too, would introduce a fairer split of three games at home and three away but retain the biennial home and away roster. True, there would be some extra fixtures to be squeezed in but it would take down Warburton’s glass ceiling. Crucially the emphasis would be on enhancing what already exists rather than selfishly ring-fencing the interests of a few. Then again, would the pluses ultimately outweigh the minuses? Adding South Africa would have major implications for the Lions, among others. How many people really want to spend a long weekend in Joburg or Pretoria rather than Rome? What about the increased carbon footprint? And would it not be logistically simpler for the championship to stay purely European and for the global element to be reserved for the July and November windows instead? Questions, questions, with no definitive answers as yet. But if, in 2032, you walk past a busy bar in Durban, Lisbon or Tbilisi and hear John Denver playing, it’ll be proof that international rugby is in rude health.

2/8/2022,"Shoppers across the UK passing their local Primark were puzzled this weekend as they spotted Greggs steak bakes and vegan sausage rolls discreetly tucked into mannequins’ handbags and pockets in window displays. Their curiosity was piqued further on Primark’s social media accounts, which displayed a receipt showing items from the Gregg’s menu with a curious emoji. The secret has now been revealed as the two popular high street retailers announced a partnership on their social media channels in a carefully curated PR moment, announcing the launch of a new fashion line on 19 February and the opening of Tasty by Greggs, a new cafe in Birmingham’s Primark branch said to be the “world’s most Instagrammable Greggs”, a week before on 12 February.  The launch video promised: “One does tidy food, one does tidy fashion. Together we’re unstoppable.”The errant baked goods prompted a lot of speculation about the collaboration on social media at the weekend. One commenter, whose tweet received thousands of likes, said: “Shoutout to whichever stone cold legend at Newcastle Primark has accidentally left a load of Greggs in the window display.”The 130-seater cafe will open in Primark’s largest store selling Gregg’s signature dishes including sausage rolls, bakes, pizza, desserts and coffee. It promises “the ultimate Greggs experience”, replete with tables decorated to look like doughnuts and a doughnut swing where the brand hopes customers will take photos to post on Instagram. Greggs has yet to reveal the clothing line, and whether it will feature prints of its iconic baked goods, however one PR image shows a simple hoodie featuring the Greggs logo. The limited-edition range of 11 pieces will be available in 60 stores. Raymond Reynolds, the Greggs business development director, said that customers had “continually asked” for Greggs branded clothing. “Fans can quite literally show their love for Greggs on their sleeves,” he said. Greggs and Primark will open a pop-up boutique in Soho between 17 and 18 February to “offer eager fashionistas the chance to get their hands on some of the new collection before the rest of the nation”, with two pieces available for free to those who manage to secure a slot when bookings open on 10 February. Tim Kelly, the director of new business development at Primark, said the retailer was looking to team with brands “we know [our customers] love” on clothing ranges and in-store experiences. Collaborations are increasingly popular among brands to enable them to reach two sets of customers at once. One of the most iconic brand partnerships is between Nike and Apple, which was formed in 2006 and includes Apple Watch Nike, a collaboration that brings together technology and fitness.",News/Business,Roll up for the Greggs and Primark exclusive fashion collaboration,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/08/roll-up-for-the-greggs-and-primark-exclusive-fashion-collaboration
2/8/2022,"Emmanuel Macron held talks with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv on Tuesday amid confusion over French claims that Russia has privately agreed not to carry out any new “military initiatives”. French officials made the suggestion after six hours of talks late on Monday between Macron and Vladimir Putin. The officials, speaking anonymously, said Putin had agreed to pull Russian troops out of Belarus once military exercises conclude later this month.  But there was no confirmation from the Kremlin of what would in effect amount to a climbdown from the Russian side after months of deliberate pressure on Ukraine. Putin did not confirm the reports in his comments to the media in Moscow. In a call with reporters on Tuesday, Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, denied that Putin had made a deal with Macron to de-escalate. “This is wrong in its essence. Moscow and Paris couldn’t do any deals. It’s simply impossible,” Peskov said, insinuating that it would be pointless to make a deal with France. Peskov added: “France is a leading country in the EU, France is a member of Nato, but Paris is not the leader there. In this bloc, a very different country is in charge. So what deals can we talk about?” He confirmed that Russian troops would exit Belarus at the end of joint exercises on 20 February, claiming this had always been the plan. There was concern in Kyiv over a briefing that Macron appears to have given to French journalists travelling on his plane in which he suggested “Finlandising” Ukraine might resolve the crisis. The term Findlandisation refers to Helsinki’s non-aligned status during the cold war. According to Le Figaro, Macron mused that keeping Ukraine out of Nato could be a suitable idea. It is unclear if this plan was discussed with Putin on Monday, or if the Élysée consulted with the US, other western allies and the Ukrainians in advance. France TV Info said Macron was responding to a question from a journalist about Finlandisation. He was not actively pushing this model and did not think it would solve the crisis, it reported. The Biden administration has rejected Putin’s demand that Nato rule out membership for Ukraine. In the same briefing, Macron told the French press there could be no compromises on Ukraine’s sovereignty or a return to spheres of influence – an assertion at odds with the Finlandisation idea. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said his government was not prepared to ditch its long-held red lines. These include Ukraine’s right to make its own security choices and its refusal to hold negotiations with Moscow-backed separatists. “No one will be able to force us to cross them,” he said on Tuesday. Kuleba said he was “looking forward” to meeting his French counterpart, Jean-Yves Le Drian, in Kyiv and to discussing the “signals” brought by Macron from Moscow. The French officials said that during the talks Macron had agreed to “open dialogue on strategic questions”, but there were no details on what that dialogue might involve. Macron is the most senior western leader to meet Putin since Moscow began massing troops last autumn near Ukraine. The Kremlin has deployed 135,000 soldiers around Ukraine’s borders and will begin major military exercises on Thursday in Belarus, within striking distance of Kyiv. These are due to finish on 20 February. Even if the Kremlin does then withdraw tactical battalions from Belarus, it is unclear if they would return to their bases in the far-east of Russia or remain closer to Ukraine. Western states have been saying for the past weeks that they fear Russia is preparing to invade. Putin denies this but has previously said he could take “military-technical measures” if his security demands are not met. He wants Nato to return to its 1997 levels of deployment and to pull out of central and eastern Europe. Speaking alongside Macron in the Kremlin, Putin claimed that if Ukraine joined Nato in future, it would inevitably lead to conflict between Nato and Russia, given Ukraine’s claims on Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. “Ask your readers, viewers, internet users: do you want France to fight with Russia? But that’s the way it will be,” said Putin, angrily lecturing a French journalist.",News/World news,Macron holds talks with Ukraine leader as Moscow denies deal to de-escalate,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/macron-zelenskiy-ukraine-talks-moscow-denies-deal-to-de-escalate
2/8/2022,"Ethiopia has committed a wide range of human rights violations in its war against Tigrayan rebel forces, including mass killings, sexual violence and military targeting of civilians, according to a landmark legal complaint submitted to Africa’s top human rights body. Lawyers acting for Tigrayan civilians said the complaint, filed on Monday, marked the first time that the African Union’s human rights commission had been asked to look into the conduct of Ethiopian troops in their war with the northern region’s rebel forces.  The alleged violations, “could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, but further investigation would be required”, said Antonia Mulvey, executive director of the rights organisation Legal Action Worldwide (Law), which submitted the complaint with the US legal firm Debevoise & Plimpton and the Pan African Lawyers Union (Palu). “The African Commission [on Human and Peoples’ Rights] has a unique opportunity to stand by victims and survivors from this conflict, to order emergency measures to stop unlawful killing of civilians trapped in Tigray and to hold Ethiopia to account,” added Mulvey. Reporting to the 55-member African Union, the commission’s role is to investigate alleged human rights violations and make recommendations to heads of state and government. It can also make referrals to the African court on Human and Peoples’ Rights, the union’s judicial arm. The Law-Palu complaint alleges that since the conflict with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) erupted in November 2020, federal forces in Ethiopia have committed widespread violations, including the military targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure; mass and extrajudicial killings; gender-based sexual violence; arbitrary arrest and detention; mass displacement of civilians; destruction of property, food, and religious sites and cultural heritage; ethnic discrimination; and enforced information blackouts. In a statement, lawyers said the allegations were based on the testimony of Tigrayan victims who could not be listed as complainants due to fear of reprisals from the government in Addis Ababa. One written testimony, seen by the Guardian, contains allegations that Ethiopian and Eritrean forces carried out killings and rapes in the Shire region of Tigray in November 2020. “We all heard witness accounts of underage girls and old women being raped and gang-raped by the joint forces. Priests and deacons were slaughtered by the soldiers,” the testimony says. “The Ethiopian government has called the military operation in Tigray a ‘law-enforcement operation’,” the testimony continues. “But what we saw in Shire … was quite different. We saw with our own eyes that the military campaign was not only about eliminating the TPLF, but also about destroying the people and development of Tigray.” A joint investigation released in November by the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission and the UN found there were “reasonable grounds” to believe that all parties to the conflict in Tigray had, to varying degrees, committed human rights violations. Some of those breaches, it added, might amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. On Monday, Law said that, while reports suggested that abuses had been committed by different parties, Tigrayan civilians constituted “the overwhelming majority of victims”. Mulvey, a British solicitor who served on the UN’s fact-finding mission on Myanmar, said Law was keen to work alongside the commission’s existing inquiry into Tigray “to put an end to the impunity that has allowed these crimes to continue”. Donald Deya, chief executive officer of Palu, said: “The government of Ethiopia is obliged by both its constitution and international law to protect all its citizens and residents from mass atrocities and violations of their human rights. “Where it is unable or unwilling to uphold the same, as is the case here, we must seek recourse to competent international institutions. Hence, our urgent appeal to the African commission,” he said. There was no immediate comment on the complaint from the Ethiopian government or the commission, which is based in the Gambia. Ethiopia is not a state party to the founding statute of the international criminal court in The Hague, in effect making a trial there for alleged war crimes impossible without a referral from the UN security council. That possibility is considered highly unlikely due to objections from Russia and China, which can veto any such motion as permanent members of the council.",News/Global development,Ethiopia accused of ‘serious’ human rights abuses in Tigray in landmark case,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/08/ethiopia-human-rights-abuses-possible-war-crimes-tigray
2/8/2022,"Up to 40 world leaders are due to make “ambitious and concrete commitments” towards combating illegal fishing, decarbonising shipping and reducing plastic pollution at what is billed as the first high-level summit dedicated to the ocean. One Ocean summit, which opens on Wednesday in the French port of Brest, aims to mobilise “unprecedented international political engagement” for a wide range of pressing maritime issues, said its chief organiser, Olivier Poivre d’Arvor.  “It is essential,” Poivre d’Arvor said. “The climate has its Cop process but there is no equivalent for the ocean, at a time when man’s relationship with the marine world has become more and more toxic, and global heating is causing extreme change.” Convened by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, as a highlight of France’s six-month EU presidency, the three-day summit will also focus on efforts to improve governance of the high seas and coordinating international scientific research. Poivre d’Arvor, France’s ambassador for the north and south poles and marine issues, noted that the ocean covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface, is a vital climate regulator, rich in resources, key to trade and an essential link between nations. “But it’s routinely left aside in major summits, and is now under serious threat from a whole range of different pressures. So this initiative is about raising international ambition and getting concrete, measurable commitments to tangible action,” he said. Poivre d’Arvor, a keen sailor who recently published Voyage en Mers Françaises (Travels in France’s Seas), said France was the world’s second-biggest sea power after the US, with exclusive economic zones totalling more than 11m sq km. “There aren’t many countries that have legitimacy on this, but France is one of them,” he said. “There is a role for ‘blue diplomacy’ in a host of areas, from piracy to pollution to overfishing and carbon storage. I think that’s what interests the president.” Poivre d’Arvor said more than 55 countries would be represented in the Brittany port, with 18 or 19 heads of state and government attending in person and about the same number taking part by live video link or sending recorded messages. The summit will also bring together big shipping companies such as Maersk, CMA CGM and Hapag-Lloyd, which account for nearly 55% of the world’s maritime freight, as well as leading scientists, non-governmental organisations (NGO), policymakers and international bodies. “The principle is that those that are attending are coming with commitments,” Poivre d’Arvor said. “The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will announce EU-wide commitments. This is not about debating, it’s about doing.” The first two days of the summit are devoted to 30 public workshops and forums on topics including marine science, the Mediterranean, sustainable shipping, green ports, and cities at risk from rising sea levels, involving about 300 researchers, entrepreneurs and representatives of international organisations including the UN. The high-level summit on Friday morning will involve heads of state and government from all five continents, Poivre d’Arvor said, including leaders of several major world economies, although he would not be drawn on names. NGOs and campaigners have said the summit must deliver in several key areas if it is not to be seen as an exercise in “blue-washing”. Many, including Greenpeace, have said the most pressing problem is governance of the high seas – waters outside of national economic exclusion zones, which cover about half the globe. Here, the main goal is to protect biodiversity and marine ecosystems and make progress on some kind of legal order before a UN international conference in New York in March 2022. Campaigners have said they expect to see the summit produce “ambitious targets and solid progress” towards that meeting. Deep-sea exploration – below 200 metres – is another controversial topic, with mining companies, in particular, starting to show an interest in rare minerals, including nickel and cobalt, beneath parts of the ocean floor. France abstained from voting on a call at last September’s IUCN world conservation congress for a moratorium on deep-sea mining and Macron has since said he favours more deep-sea exploration. The Deep Sea Conservation Coalition has said France must formally back the mining moratorium, likening biodiversity at the bottom of the ocean to that in tropical rainforests. Credible pledges to place 30% of the world’s marine habitats in protected zones – compared with the current 7.7% – by 2030 is another international target campaigners want reinforced at the summit, as are concrete steps to tackle overfishing, a politically sensitive subject that some fear may not even be raised by the heads of state. Nineteen NGOs including the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, Sea Shepherd, Greenpeace, the High Seas Alliance Environmental Justice Foundation wrote to the French newspaper Le Monde on Monday to demand “major political announcements that will allow significant progress for the health of the global ocean”. They called on delegates to “express their full support for the conclusion of a strong, ambitious and legally binding treaty for international waters in 2022”, as well as for a political decision to relaunch consultations with Russia and China and measurable progress on overfishing. “Decision-makers at the summit have a real political opportunity to raise the importance of the ocean’s health in international policymaking,” the signatories wrote. “The time is no longer for words and observations; the solutions exist, and all that is missing is the political will to put them in place.”",News/Environment,‘Blue diplomacy’: France summit puts world’s spotlight on oceans,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/08/blue-diplomacy-france-summit-puts-worlds-spotlight-on-oceans
2/8/2022,"Thousands of people with obesity in England will be able to get a new weight loss drug on the NHS after a watchdog approved its use. Patients on the weekly injections have seen their weight fall by an average of 12% after one year, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said.  It has issued draft guidance recommending semaglutide, also known as Wegovy, for adults with at least one weight-related condition, such as obstructive sleep apnoea or heart disease, and a body mass index (BMI) of at least 35. In exceptional cases, some people with a BMI of 30 or more may also be able to access the drug, which is self-administered using a pen injector. More than one in four people in England have obesity, which means having a BMI of 30 or above. Obesity can be physically debilitating and lead to severe and potentially life-limiting conditions. It costs the NHS and the wider economy billions of pounds a year. The new drug suppresses the appetite through mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which is released after eating. Patients inject themselves with semaglutide, which makes them feel full, meaning they eat less and lose weight. “We know that management of overweight and obesity is one of the biggest challenges our health service is facing, with nearly two-thirds of adults either overweight or obese,” said Helen Knight, the programme director in the centre for health technology evaluation at Nice. “It is a lifelong condition that needs medical intervention, has psychological and physical effects, and can affect quality of life. The Nice document says access to current drug treatments for obesity is limited to a specific population who have prediabetes and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Other drug treatment options available are “poorly tolerated” and “rarely used”. It adds: “The committee concluded that there is a large unmet need for many people living with obesity, and that semaglutide would be a welcome new treatment option.” Nice said people from a south Asian, Chinese, and black African or Caribbean background would be able to access the drug at a lower BMI after advice from a medic. Patients will only be given semaglutide on prescription as part of a specialist weight management service involving input from several professionals, and for a maximum of two years. Clinical trial evidence shows that people lose more weight with semaglutide together with supervised weight loss coaching than with support alone. Experts have previously described the drug as “a gamechanger”, and suggested that for the first time people could achieve through drugs what was only previously possible through weight-loss surgery. In 2020 Boris Johnson launched the government’s anti-obesity strategy, which included plans for a ban on TV and online adverts for food high in fat, sugar and salt before 9pm and ending deals such as buy-one-get-one-free on unhealthy food high in salt, sugar and fat.",News/Society,‘Gamechanging’ weight loss drug to be made available on NHS ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/08/gamechanging-weight-loss-drug-made-available-nhs-semaglutide-obesity
2/8/2022,"The energy industry regulator has admitted that British households would have been better off weathering the winter gas crisis if it had acted sooner to crack down on financially unstable energy suppliers. The Ofgem chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, told MPs that households could face a bill of about £200m to cover the costs left by a string of energy provider collapses since gas market prices rocketed to record highs last September.  “We need a retail sector that’s more resilient and more able to deal with the kind of shock that we’ve seen,” Brearley told the Commons business select committee. “And to be clear, chair, we accept that had we done that earlier this would have been better for customers.” The Ofgem boss, who stepped into the role in February 2020, identified multiple missed opportunities to strengthen the rules for energy suppliers that could have helped to avoid the number of supplier collapses, and the related costs for bill payers and the Treasury. Instead, regulatory decisions had been “dominated” by the desire to create more competition by increasing the diversity of suppliers within the market but that new regulation to protect customers against poorly-run companies was not put forward “with the pace and scale that I think with hindsight that we needed”. “When you look back at the history of Ofgem’s decision-making … without doubt there was a perspective at the time that we needed to diversify the market, and challenge the dominance of the big incumbent companies. That’s what dominated thinking at the time. It’s my view that we should have combined that with greater financial resilience,” he said. The UK has had the largest number of energy company casualties across Europe, after a steady influx of energy startups to the market over recent years, many of which used their customers’ credit balances to provide working capital while offering heavily discounted energy deals. The cost of paying these credit balances back to customers after their supplier has gone bust, combined with the cost of sourcing gas and electricity from the market at current rates, is covered by imposing higher energy bills across the market. Although the regulator brought in plans to toughen financial checks on small suppliers at the beginning of 2020, it has taken action against only one, despite evidence that many in the market relied on their customers’ credit balances to stay afloat. It set out new rules in November last year that will test energy companies against a range of financial scenarios, and set an improvement plan for companies showing signs of financial weakness that could put their customers at risk. In a scathing report late last year, Citizens Advice said there had been evidence of financial weakness in the energy market “long before this year’s crisis”, but that Ofgem had failed to heed warnings, meaning households would bear the brunt of its “catalogue of errors”. Citizens Advice has called for an independent review of the causes of the market collapse, including Ofgem’s regulation and reforms, and action by the government and Ofgem to protect consumers from unnecessarily steep increases to bills to pay for the cost of supplier collapses.",News/Business,Ofgem admits it should have acted sooner to protect UK households,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/08/ofgem-regulator-uk-energy-market-collapsed-providers
2/8/2022,"Two suspected Islamic State recruits, one of them carrying a British passport, were seized by the Taliban when they tried to slip into Afghanistan last autumn through its northern border, the Guardian can reveal. The men, who were carrying more than £10,000 in cash, military fatigues and night-vision goggles in their bags, were arrested after a tipoff from Uzbekistan, according to a Taliban source with knowledge of the operation.  “There was one passport from England and one from another country in Europe,” said the source. He discussed the men’s capture at the border crossing of Hairatan on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to journalists. An Uzbek source said both men were using British passports when they flew into the Uzbek capital, Tashkent – it is not clear whether one also had a European passport that he used at the Afghan border, or whether the Taliban source was confused – and both had Afghan heritage. Their interception was a stark reminder that while the west was able to end its war in Afghanistan by withdrawing troops, there is no such simple resolution to the security threat posed by international terror groups that shelter inside its borders. Hundreds of Britons went to live under Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, but this is the first time UK citizens have been intercepted allegedly trying to join the group in Afghanistan, and the first reported case of attempted international recruitment to IS since the Taliban took power in the country. Two French citizens are reported to have travelled from central Asia to join Islamic State in Afghanistan several years ago, and another was intercepted in 2017 by Tajik authorities, tried and jailed for five years. The Islamic State’s affiliate in Afghanistan – known as Islamic State Khorasan (ISK), after a historic name for the region – is well funded and resilient. It has carried out multiple large-scale suicide attacks in Kabul and other big cities since the Taliban took control of the country last year, and now has a presence in every province in Afghanistan, a senior UN official said in November. ISK is one of the few options left for westerners drawn to violent extremism in the name of Islam now that the Syrian civil war has largely been reduced to a bloody stalemate in a corner of the country. “One of the reasons people are heading to Afghanistan is simply that there is nowhere else to go. It is perhaps the most likely place for aspiring jihadists who want to see combat,” said Ashley Jackson, an expert in armed groups in Afghanistan and the author of Negotiating Survival, about civilian relations with the Taliban insurgency. Last week US special forces made a rare raid inside north-west Syria to kill Islamic State’s leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi. The risky military operation makes clear that Washington still sees the group as a major threat worldwide. An Uzbek source confirmed that authorities there flagged up the two men to Afghan authorities for checks because they had triggered intelligence concerns but had not violated any Uzbek laws – the country has visa-free entry for UK passport holders – and were not on Interpol wanted lists. “In terms of visas, they were all in order,” he said. “We couldn’t prevent them entering because they are British. We couldn’t prevent them going on because they had Afghan visas.” They told border guards they had family ties to Jalalabad, the capital of eastern Nangarhar province, and initially claimed they were travelling to visit relatives, the Taliban source said. However, they struggled to explain their luggage. As well as cash and military fatigues, they had packed combat vests that the source described as “suicide vests without explosives”. When questioned, the men reportedly claimed these were just things they found “interesting”. They flew into Tashkent and then made the 430-mile (700km) journey to the border crossing by road, the Uzbek source said. They are thought to have collected at least some of the military gear on the way. Although a flight to Islamabad would have offered a much shorter overland journey to Afghanistan’s east, currently the main ISK stronghold in Afghanistan, the men would have needed a visa to enter Pakistan if travelling on UK passports. The Guardian saw photos of the men taken soon after their arrival in Afghanistan. Their appearance matched descriptions of two men whom Taliban members have accused of Islamic State links, independent Afghan sources said. The 9/11 attacks in 2001 drew troops from the US and its allies to Afghanistan to topple the Taliban because they had offered safe haven to al-Qaida. Thousands of lives and billions of dollars later, the Taliban are back in power, and although al-Qaida’s leader Osama bin Laden is dead, his legacy lives on. British and US intelligence officials warned even before the Taliban took Kabul that the terror threat from Afghanistan was likely to grow with the group in charge, while western ability to monitor it declined precipitously. The Taliban promised Washington, in the deal that paved the way for America’s withdrawal, that they would not offer save haven to international terror groups. But it was a commitment beyond their power to keep, even if they wanted to. Islamic State and the Taliban have been at war since the group first emerged in the region in 2015, drawing recruits from other international extremist groups. It was beaten down by the combined efforts of US, Afghan government and Taliban forces until 2019 but has since rebuilt. It got a strong boost from Taliban-orchestrated prison breaks in the final days of the republic, which returned between 2,000 and 3,000 fighters to the battlefield, according to a recent report on the group’s resurgence. They included the man thought to have carried out the bloody attack on Kabul airport in the final days of the foreign evacuation last August. More than 400 were foreign fighters, from across central Asia and beyond, including a handful from Jordan and the Maldives, the report said. “My worst fear is that the Taliban underestimate the challenge of combating terrorism as a government,” Jackson said. “They were very effective at taking on Islamic State when they were fighting a rival insurgent group, but it is very different to be an incumbent state power. “It is not in Taliban’s interest to have these groups operate, but we should not underestimate their arrogance and incompetence. They don’t have money, capacity, resources to secure borders, surveil groups and respond.” Recent Islamic State suicide attacks have been a show of their reach, including ones targeting the Taliban leadership at a family funeral service, and another in Kandahar city, where the group has deep roots and solid support. Abdul Sayed, an analyst focused on extremism in Afghanistan, and co-author of the report on ISK, said: “It was an exhibition of strength carrying out for the first time a very brutal attack in Kandahar, stronghold of the Taliban, a message that if we can strike here, we can carry out attacks anywhere in the country.” For now, their focus is mostly domestic and regional. Although some westerners may try to find their way to the group, they are not being actively targeted. “I don’t think ISK will be inviting or welcoming foreign fighters at least until they have an area of territory more firmly under their control. Supporting foreign fighters is an expense and a liability for them,” Sayed said. “They claim to have global ambitions, but I haven’t seen any particular direct threat from their propaganda materials against the west or any western countries specifically. For now they are more directed to regional states.” They are recruiting widely in Afghanistan, from extremist Taliban disillusioned with compromises on hardline doctrine, from poor Taliban footsoldiers who need salaries the government cannot pay, and even from the ranks of former government forces who feel they need protection from Taliban revenge killings. In response the Taliban has deployed harsh tactics, reportedly including extrajudicial killings of young men in eastern strongholds. The two British men, who were taken to the regional capital of Mazar-e-Sharif from the border, may have faced similar treatment. “The mujahideen are very aware of Daesh and are working on this issue very hard,” said the Taliban source, when asked about how the men would be treated. He had no direct information on their future, but general policy for IS detainees was clear, he added. “The rules from our leader are to just finish them, don’t let them do anything. No mercy.” Afghanistan has a long history of human rights abuses committed by all sides in its long-running conflict, intended to stamp out opposition. They usually have the opposite effect, driving recruitment from angry and bereaved communities, and if Islamic State in Afghanistan gets stronger, it will not only be the Taliban’s concern.

2/8/2022,"Facebook and Instagram should tighten privacy rules to protect against the revealing of private residential addresses and images online, known as doxxing, according to the independent body that decides if content should be on the social media platforms. The Oversight Board of Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has recommended that an exception to the company’s privacy rules that allows the sharing of private residential information when it is considered “publicly available” should be removed.  Such a move “would help Meta better protect people’s private residential information”, the board said in its “policy advisory opinion” published on Tuesday. However, the board said Meta should allow the publication of addresses and imagery of official residences provided to high-ranking government officials, such as heads of state to allow the organisation of protests at official residences. Victims of doxing, include journalists, abortion providers and celebrities such as Scarlett Johansson, Kim Kardashian and Lady Gaga. Among its other recommendations, the board proposes that Meta create a communications channel for victims of doxing and give users more control over how they consent to sharing their private residential information. The Facebook Privacy Violations policy states that “private information may become publicly available through news coverage, court filings, press releases, or other sources”, so when that happens, Meta may allow the information to be posted. Currently, Meta’s internal guidance provided to content reviewers states that information “published by at least five news outlets” is no longer private information for the purposes of the Facebook Privacy Violations policy, the Oversight Board revealed. “Once this information is shared, the harms that can result, such as doxing, are difficult to remedy,” the board added. “Harms resulting from doxing disproportionately affect groups such as women, children and LGBTQIA+ people, and can include emotional distress, loss of employment and even physical harm or death.” As a result, the board recommended removing the exception that allows the sharing of private residential information when considered “publicly available.”. This means Meta would no longer allow otherwise violating content on Facebook and Instagram if it has been “published by at least five news outlets”. It would also no longer allow content if it contains residential addresses or imagery from financial records or statements of an organisation, court records, professional and business licenses, sex offender registries or press releases from government agencies, or law enforcement, the board added. However, the board stated that Meta’s “newsworthiness exception” should be consistently applied, which allows content reviewers to escalate for additional review “public interest content” that potentially violates privacy rules but may be eligible for the newsworthiness exception. The board recommended allowing the sharing of “imagery that displays the external view of private residences” when the property depicted is the focus of the news story but Meta should not allow the sharing of images of private residences when there is a “context of organising protests against the resident”. The board also said Meta should allow the publication of addresses and imagery of official residences provided to high-ranking government officials, such as heads of state, heads of federal or local government, ambassadors and consuls to allow the organisation of protests at publicly owned official residences.

2/8/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email.  Welcome back to Pushing Buttons! First off, thank you very much to everyone who’s emailed me to ask a question, recommend a game or express their appreciation for the newsletter since it launched. This is fast becoming my favourite part of my job – and though I very passionately believe that video games ought to be taken seriously, I love that this newsletter provides a moment of enjoyable levity in the week for so many of you. That’s part of why games matter: they make us happy. One such email came from reader Iain Noble, who got me thinking about difficulty in video games – a rolling debate that is about to become topical again thanks to Sifu, an unconventional and by all accounts ridiculously hard kung fu game, out today. Ian asks: “As a ‘mature’ gamer aged 74, I find that my reflexes are not what they were. Increasingly I have to turn down the difficulty settings on games in order to play,” he says. “A recent example would be Kena: Bridge of Spirits. Much of the ‘debate’ on gamer forums centres on the difficulty of new games. Do you have any thoughts on this?” Look: I love a difficult game. I grew up at a time when most games were difficult (usually because they were a bit broken, rather than because of their creative intent), and so I developed a high frustration tolerance that usually sees me through games such as Dark Souls and Returnal, where the difficulty is part of the point. I derive immense joy from slaying giant dragons in Monster Hunter and facing up to horrifying bosses in Bloodborne. I find competitive play too stressful – multiplayer shooters and sports games get me too agitated to be enjoyable. But when it’s just me versus the game, I’m all about a challenge. I also think that barely any of these games would be adversely affected by offering some kind of easier mode for players who aren’t wired like I am. Some people derive absolutely no satisfaction from games that punish you for failure; others have disabilities that make games tough to play without adaptations. Also, plenty of players simply don’t have the time to master a game over the course of tens of hours, but might still like to experience its story. If you can offer players options, whether that’s an auto-aim, an easy mode or the ability to skip a scene if it’s too annoying, a la Grand Theft Auto 5, then why not? This particular discourse has become very spicy on social media over the years, with those standing up in favour of difficult games being accused of gatekeeping, and those in favour of universal accessibility accused of undermining developers’ creative vision. Of course not every game has to cater to every player; there are entire genres that have thrown out the idea that something has to be challenging to be fun, including the thriving and diverse world of narrative games and so-called “visual novels”, which put few or no barriers in the way of telling their stories. Nintendo is superb at mitigating the difficulty of newer Mario games by offering optional superpowers: if you flub a level a few times, a magic suit will appear that makes Mario invincible and improves his jump. Nobody’s enjoyment of the game is ruined, and kids can finish the level without actually crying in frustration like I used to over Super Mario Bros 3. I like to relate this to novels, largely because I once spent three painful months struggling through the over 1,000 pages and endless self-referential footnotes of David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest. Was it difficult? Yes. Could I have given up if I’d wanted to? Yes. But I found the reward to be worth it, so I kept going. The difference between a book and a game is that a book doesn’t physically close itself if you’re struggling with a paragraph. Games can be as challenging as they like, but they should also try to offer players a way through, where possible. Here’s a great illustration of this concept: a game often (wrongly) touted as one of the most difficult of all time, and one of my personal obsessions, Demon’s Souls (and the Dark Souls series that followed it). This game is hard, in that the combat is tough, you’re often sent a long way back when you die, and everything tries to kill you all the time. But it also mitigates that difficulty by letting you summon other players into your game to help you out. You need a certain amount of skill, but you don’t have to be amazing at the game to see it through. Greater challenges are there for those who seek them: people have played through Souls without taking a single hit, without levelling up, and using mad novelty controllers. But the game adapts to who’s playing it, as much as it can. By contrast, I must admit that I found the rather less adaptable samurai action game Sekiro (from the same developer) so impossibly hard that I had to reluctantly give up. What I wouldn’t have given to be able to call someone in to help me with Genichiro Ashina, the boss fight that marks the frustrating end of a lot of players’ tether. I like to think I’ll see the rest of that game one day, but it’ll require time and determination that I currently do not have. I have been very busy playing a certain very big, very expensive game for a review next week, but I’m not supposed to talk about that just yet, so I’m going to recommend the recently released Life Is Strange: Remastered Collection. These narrative games tell the stories of Max and Chloe, two teenage best friends, and an impending tragedy in their home town of Arcadia Bay. Max has a power that any teen would surely kill for: the ability to rewind time, redo conversations and try to undo her mistakes. Some of the dialogue is a bit corny and contrived, and this kind of game isn’t as unusual now as it was seven years ago when Life Is Strange was first released. But the complicated best-friend relationships between Max and Chloe and Chloe and Amber, the real heart of the game, still stand up so well. In 2015, this was only the second time I’d ever seen female friendship and relationships portrayed like this in a video game, the first being The Last of Us: Left Behind. It’s totally worth revisiting, especially if you missed it at the time. Available on: PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, XboxApproximate playtime: 8-10 hours In the wake of the seven-figure Wordle buyout, our games correspondent Keith Stuart interviewed the New York Times’ head of games about the plan for the viral word game going forward. I learned from this that the NYT is pretty serious about gaming, having hired someone who used to run studios for EA and Zynga to head up their games and puzzles. Overall a reassuring interview, I feel. The Nintendo Switch console has now outsold the Wii, which dominated the 00s, at 103.5 million units. That’s a lot of people playing Mario Kart. In news that should really surprise nobody, development on Grand Theft Auto 6 is “well underway” at Rockstar. Given that GTA V isn’t far from ten years old, I think we’re all ready for something new from one of gaming’s most profitable and infamous series. OlliOlli World review – vibey skater game offers a meditative ride Windjammers 2 review – resuscitated sports game brings back joy of the arcade Dying Light 2: Stay Human review – as dead inside as the zombie hordes I asked video game writer Alec Meer, who’s written on games for Creative Assembly, Devolver, Housemarque, Amplitude and more, to answer this week’s question: why do video game stories almost never work as films? “The primary reason is that Hollywood screenwriters consider video game writers to be goblinoid nerd-scum who, by their very existence, pollute and debase the noble art of storytelling. As such, it is only right and proper that as many of the filthy, squalid little ideas born from game writers’ twisted, sub-sentient, desperately underpaid minds should be discarded, and replaced with the wondrous fruit of Proper Writers’ superhuman and highly remunerated minds. Hence, the original game’s story is replaced with an entirely different story, devised solely by these latter-day gods. “Secondarily, it has long been perceived wisdom that a game story – which so often involves several hours of a man killing other men in corridors while those men repeatedly shout things like “die, you smelly rotter!” and “eat this extremely deadly grenade, my dude!” – is inherently incompatible with the three-act structure of a movie. This is, in fact, incorrect. Video game stories work brilliantly as films, but only if a) they’re not based on an actual video game and b) the film is called John Wick.” If you’ve got a question for Question Block or anything to say about the newsletter, email us on pushingbuttons@guardian.co.uk.",Arts/Games,Pushing Buttons: why games don’t have to be hard to be good,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/08/pushing-buttons-sifu-dark-souls-game-difficulty
2/8/2022,"Rheiss Brown has been “around the block a bit” when it comes to his career, he says. The 30-year-old has had a range of interesting jobs, from working for the London 2012 Olympic Games, to setting up his own Caribbean takeaway shop. Brown launched his food business with a friend in 2018, selling modern Caribbean food such as burgers and wraps. But the work could be gruelling. “Food is demanding, there are no days off and long hours,” he says. Then the pandemic made it even more challenging. “You have to know when it’s time to walk away,” he says.  So Brown took a break and planned his next move. After speaking to his cousin, an engineer at Openreach, which runs the UK’s digital network, he realised the organisation’s apprenticeship programme appealed to him. “I’m someone who’s a critical thinker and I’m ambitious,” he says. “I was looking for a new challenge, somewhere with stability and somewhere you can grow.” Brown secured a place on the trainee engineer apprenticeship and enjoyed the structure and routine, as well as meeting people from different backgrounds. “I look forward to going to work, I’m constantly learning, and it’s fulfilling.” A highlight was learning to climb a pole – even though he’s afraid of heights. “I used to enjoy climbing trees and garages as a kid, but the older I’ve got, the more fearful I’ve become. So the first time we did it I was shaking, but my trainer made me feel confident.” Openreach is one of the largest apprenticeship providers in the UK. “We’re recruiting in every town, every region, almost every village,” says Kevin Brady, a HR director at the company. “We’ve recruited more than 10,000 apprentices in the last three to four years and we underpin that with a massive investment in terms of training, with 11 regional training centres,” he says. Openreach is particularly keen to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) apprentices as BAME workers are underrepresented in the engineering workforce. “We are keen to attract people who reflect our customers,” says Brady. With four networks in place to bring people together from different backgrounds – Pride, Gender Equality, Ethnic Diversity, and Neurodiversity – which are run by, and for, colleagues, Openreach aims to become a fairer and more inclusive employer. The organisation also values people with maturity and life experience, such as Brown, and wants to encourage more women to apply. “We’re trying to change the perception that being a telecom engineer is a man’s job,” says Brady. “And we’ve been able to shift the dial and encourage a lot more women into engineering – for example, in 2021, we recruited more than 600 women engineers.” A recent study by Openreach that put the language used in job adverts under the microscope shows that gender-discriminatory language discourages as many as 50% of female candidates from applying for engineering roles. The study also found that when presented with a gender-inclusive advert, the number of women interested in a role increased by more than 200%, with 60% stating this was because of the way it was written. At Openreach, 20% of trainee engineer recruits are women – a number the company aims to retain as a minimum yearly target. One of Openreach’s women engineers, Anita Josephs, 32, joined as a trainee engineer in 2019, after working in an office for more than a decade. “I’d been with the same company for 11 years,” she says. “And I felt like I wanted to do something different.” So when a colleague shared a post on Facebook, she was immediately interested. “I thought: ‘That looks amazing,’ so I applied and everything was a whirlwind from there.” After an interview and assessment day, Josephs was offered a place. From learning how to use a gas detection unit, to working with customers, Josephs says she was constantly challenged in a supportive environment. Like Brown, she enjoyed learning to climb a pole. “I was nervous and excited,” she says. “It was my 30th birthday, so I thought: ‘It’s good I’m doing something exciting.’” Since finishing her apprenticeship, Josephs has shot up the career ladder and been promoted to field-based coordinator – Openreach employs more than 37,000 people and has a career pathway to give employees such as Josephs a chance to progress. She’s more than happy in her new role. “I don’t get that Sunday evening syndrome,” she says. “In a way, it doesn’t feel like work, it’s varied and I’m using my brain. I’m constantly thinking of solutions and getting out and about and travelling to places.” Usman Shabbir, 30, is currently doing his apprenticeship with Openreach in West Yorkshire, after working at a bank as a contractor. “I enjoyed it, but there was no job security,” he says. Shabbir heard about Openreach through word-of-mouth and it appealed to him for a number of reasons. “There’s flexibility and job security. You can continuously get upskilled. Every day is different. In the office, every day was the same – but now there are challenges.” Shabbir says it’s been great to work with inspiring engineers during the apprenticeship. “I’ve always had support when I need it,” he says. The apprenticeship at Openreach, with all its challenges, has given him more confidence in himself. He says he plans to continue upskilling and to move into new roles within the company once he finishes his apprenticeship. With 7-13 February being National Apprenticeship Week, what advice would the apprentices give others considering a career with Openreach? “I would say to be yourself,” says Brady. “If you’ve got a great attitude, are good with customers and like solving problems, then this is a career that you should think about.” “Go for it,” says Brown. “Life is too short for regrets.” Find out more about apprenticeship opportunities at Openreach, and how to apply here",Go further with an apprenticeship,‘I don’t get that Sunday evening syndrome’: how an apprenticeship can transform your career,https://www.theguardian.com/go-further-with-an-apprenticeship/2022/feb/08/i-dont-get-that-sunday-evening-syndrome-how-an-apprenticeship-can-transform-your-career
2/8/2022,"Sitting in the back of my parents’ Peugeot 504 as a child, we listened to songs by the likes of Mukesh, Mohammed Rafi and, of course, Lata Mangeshkar. We were too young to understand what they were about – love, loss, and romance – but we knew all the lyrics. Well, not quite all of them. During her 92 years, Mangeshkar recorded 50,000 songs in 18 languages, breaking records as the most recorded artist in human history. As a playback singer for Bollywood films, she was never seen on screen, but her voice, dubbed in place of the actors’, was unmistakable. She got her start in 1942, and for a woman to have a career this long and distinguished in India, Mangeshkar must have been steely beneath those silk saris – her voice, though, remained gentle, and she was known as “the nightingale”.  Choosing just 10 songs from Mangeshkar’s repertoire isn’t easy, and not just because there are so many of them. For me, her catalogue is intertwined with my personal memories. Written by Madan Mohan in 1964 for the movie Woh Kaun Thi?, this song was picturised (portrayed on screen) by the actor Sadhana. She smoulders in a sleeveless sari and pearls as she sings to her lover; he’s in a tweed jacket, moving between branches of trees, as she tells him this may be the last time they embrace in this lifetime. The black-and-white images are full of longing looks and eyeliner that would make Cleopatra envious. Throughout my life, I’ve heard it on vinyl, cassette, CD, and now I ask Alexa to stream it in my house. The best songs evolve as we do, and though the melody remains the same, the lyrics about embracing the one you love have taken on new meaning. It makes me think of my dad, my first love, my husband, and my sons. I play it to my children every night – so frequently that my eldest, who doesn’t understand Hindi or Urdu, looked up at me during a recent trip to buy parathas and said: “Mama, they’re playing our song!” When I asked my Twitter followers to flood my timeline with Mangeshkar’s songs in the wake of her death, the film Pakeezah was mentioned many times. Made in 1972, it tells the story of star-crossed lovers, one a courtesan and the other a nawab (nobleman). He spots her bare feet as she sleeps on a train and he immediately falls in love. He leaves her a note and the story goes from there: through the twists and turns of fate they meet, separate, and meet again. As playback singers Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi pass the lyrics back and forth, the twinkly Chalo Dildar Chalo is picturised by Meena Kumari and Raj Kumar, who gaze into each other’s eyes on a rowing boat. The idea of sailing past the moon with one’s lover takes me back to a time when I was less jaded from folding laundry, and the melody, set against Urdu poetry, captures that period of 70s Hindi cinema. You can’t talk about Mangeshkar without mentioning the film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. Released in 1995, it became known by the acronym DDLJ and changed the face of Hindi cinema. It starred Shah Rukh Khan, who would go on to be the king of Bollywood, and the queen of comedic timing, Kajol. The story followed their serendipitous meetings as they interrailed across Europe, fell in love and fought age-old patriarchal ways. Mangeshkar had been singing for more than 50 years by the time of DDLJ, but we still believed her as the innocent voice of twentysomething Simran whom Raj romanced in a field full of yellow mustard flowers, her hair billowing freely. This takes me back to being 13 years old and visiting family in Karachi. The song was more than a decade old by then, but this was one of the songs on my aunt’s well-worn cassette as we drove along the beach in Clifton. It was recorded for the film Shor in 1972, and incidentally was picturised on a beach. Tensions between Pakistan and India are well known, but with her proficiency in Urdu and Hindi, Mangeshkar was equally loved on both sides on the border. The love of her voice and songs was one of the things that united those of us who grew up in the diaspora together. And hearing her cite Pakistan’s Noor Jehan – who was known as “the queen of melody” – as one of her influences, and responsible for influencing her correct pronunciation of Urdu, cemented the connection. Though a devout Hindu, Mangeshkar’s music scope also spanned the Hindu-Muslim divide. While not devotional, this ghazal – a rhyming-couplet poem – is a conversation with God. I remember listening to this track endlessly in my late-20s as I nursed a broken heart. Like many people of Pakistani heritage, I was raised with a love of poetry. But growing up in England meant that I couldn’t read Urdu. The catalogue of ghazals, recorded by Mangeshakar, and Jagjit Singh with whom she recorded the iconic album, Sajda, allowed me to access a huge part of my cultural heritage. I can recite hundreds of couplets from poets ranging from Ghalib, to Waris Shah, and Mir Taqi Mir, thanks in part to artists such as Mangeshkar. The songs made me feel less alone, that someone else had felt the way I did in that moment, and hearing the language of my parents was soothing. This is from the acclaimed film Lagaan (2001), starring Aamir Khan, with Mangeshkar singing for Gracy Singh. The film is set in 1893, and the story revolves around a small village in central India, whose inhabitants, burdened by high taxes and several years of drought, find themselves in an extraordinary situation as an arrogant British army officer challenges them to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid paying the taxes they owe. Mangeshkar’s musical scope was as broad as the length of her career, and one must mention the bhajans she sang, like this one: a style of devotional, reverent Hindu song. Although I am Muslim, there is something about the tranquility of this track, alongside Mangeshkar’s and AR Rahman’s voices, that makes it spiritual to me. In 1994, a film called 1942: A Love Story, brought us the classic soundtrack that featured Kuch Na Kaho. Like all of the Bollywood films I adored as a teenager, it was all longing and smouldering eyes, but with a dash of patriotism. It starred the heart-throb Anil Kapoor, and Manisha Koirala in various chiffon outfits. I couldn’t tell you what the film was about, but I can sing every lyric to the songs from it. There were “happy” and “sad” versions of Kuch Na Kaho – I loved the first, the idea of falling in love, but the sad version made a home in my heart. Lyrics by Javed Akhtar mean it holds the gravitas of a ghazal, but RD Burman’s musical arrangement means it never feels heavy. As Mangeshkar sings about loss, the passing of time, and losing of dreams, she pauses in all the right places, and gives the song a feeling of resignation. The first time I heard this song I was so overcome I had to stop the car. The lyrics are taken from the work of 18th-century poet Mir Taqi Mir, who is remembered as Khuda-e-Sukhan or the God of Poetry, and the resulting song is in the film Bazaar, starring the talented Naseeruddin Shah, Farooq Shaikh, and Smita Patil: the kind of film that made Indian cinema great because it cleverly handled the untold stories of what was going on in the underbelly of society. This appears in Guide, produced in 1965 by Dev Anand who also starred alongside Waheeda Rehman. She plays Rosie, the daughter of a courtesan who leaves a bad marriage with the help of Raju, and becomes a successful dancer. The two fall in love along the way. This song was on the soundtrack to my late 20s after I too left a bad marriage, and found myself again. Rehman’s turquoise sari coupled with Mangeshkar’s voice are the epitome of joy to me; she sings about making the decision to live again, and on her terms, of all the things she’s overcome, and how that feels. The sound of the dholak makes me want to dance around the kitchen every single time. Plus the ghungroo in the background, the violins … it’s all so multilayered. Bring me my turquoise sari as I head to collect my kids from school! If you listen to my heart, it’s as if it beats to this song from the film Razia Sultan. Made in 1983 and starring Hema Malini and Dharmendra, it tells the story of Razia Sultana, the first female Muslim ruler of the subcontinent, and the only female Muslim ruler of Delhi. The song is full intellectual questions about life and longing. It talks of the desert of life, the endless thirst of life: big questions that people may not expect from a song that has remained popular for decades, but Mangeshkar breathes life into something that could have been too heavy for popular culture. At a time when south Asian women were searching for role models, she allowed us to access past inspirations through music, poetry, and the sound of her flawless voice. She, too, is now part of that history.",Arts/Music,‘The epitome of joy’: 10 of Lata Mangeshkar’s greatest songs,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/08/the-epitome-of-joy-10-of-lata-mangeshkars-greatest-songs

For Christmas, I gave her a third sex toy: an even more powerful model. While our sex life is great, she now struggles to climax just with me, and has become addicted to the quick powerful orgasms the machines give her.
