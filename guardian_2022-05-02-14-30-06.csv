5/2/2022,"Untreated sewage was discharged into England’s coastal bathing waters for more than 160,000 hours last year, according to figures collated by the Liberal Democrats to mark the start of the summer sea-swimming season. Data compiled by the party using Environment Agency figures on 2021 discharges shows that water companies released raw sewage 25,000 times into designated bathing waters off the English coast. Figures collated by the campaign group Top of the Poops reveal that when also including the bathing waters in Wales, water companies released untreated sewage for 217,804 hours. The bathing water designations – which were created by the EU – are supposed to highlight the country’s cleanest and safest waters for the public. The quality of the water is publicly identified on signs at the bathing beaches, ranging from excellent to poor. The longest discharges into bathing waters were carried out by United Utilities, which released untreated sewage into sea-swimming spots in its area for almost 75,000 hours. The company’s worst-hit bathing water site was Morecambe South beach. Southern Water, which was last year fined a record £90m for spilling billions of litres of raw sewage into Hampshire and Kent coastal waters, was responsible for 20,367 hours of untreated sewage discharges into designated bathing spots off the coast in their area. South West Water discharged sewage into bathing beauty spots for 43,901 hours, with their longest discharge released at Ilfracombe’s Wildersmouth Beach, lasting 1,833 hours. The figures were released as the official sea-swimming season opened on Sunday. This marks the start of annual monitoring of bathing-water quality, which helps to inform the public about the water at beaches they visit. The season lasts until September. Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrats rural affairs spokesperson, said: “It is now or never to save families from swimming in sewage-infested waters this summer. “Children should be free to enjoy Britain’s great coastlines and lakes, yet Conservative ministers are letting water companies get away with shameful sewage dumps. This is an environmental scandal.” The data was released as many parts of the UK prepare to go to the polls on Thursday to vote in local elections. The Liberal Democrats have called for a sewage tax on water companies’ profits to be used to clean up coastlines, rivers and lakes. Environment Agency data shows that in 2021 water companies released raw sewage into all coastal waters and rivers in England for more than 2.7m hours. The Lib Dems said that in the same year the firms made £2.8bn in operating profits and paid out £27m in bonuses to senior executives. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of the campaigning charity Surfers Against Sewage, said: “Water companies are getting away with blue murder – repeatedly dumping raw sewage into areas of special recreational interest, with seeming impunity. “Our great beach-loving public shouldn’t have to swim or surf the gauntlet 0f sewage, pathogens and pharmaceuticals that are pumped out through water company pipes. Surfers Against Sewage has been challenging the water industry for decades, calling for them to put people and planet before excessive profits and executive bonuses. We demand a new decade of ambition to clean up and protect all our bathing waters and blue spaces.”",News/Environment,"Raw sewage ‘pumped into English bathing waters 25,000 times in 2021’",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/02/untreated-sewage-discharge-england-coastal-bathing-waters-2021
5/2/2022,"Tens of thousands of patients are still waiting to start cancer treatment in England due to disruption during the pandemic, according to NHS figures, as medical charities called on the government to tackle chronic staff shortages in the health service. Following a dramatic slump in cancer referrals in 2020, the number of people being investigated for the disease bounced back in the past year, data from NHS England and NHS Improvement show, rising from 2.4 million to a record 2.66 million. But while referrals have surged, the number of patients starting treatment for the disease have risen more modestly, from 313,000 before the Covid crisis to 315,000 in the past 12 months, according to the figures. “We have seen record numbers of people coming forward for checks in the last year, but we know there are still at least 30,000 who haven’t started treatment due to the pandemic, so it’s vital that we keep these referral rates high,” said Dame Cally Palmer, the national cancer director for NHS England. The NHS has doubled its spending on cancer awareness campaigns and invested in cancer symptom hotlines, mobile clinics and one-stop shops for tests to cope with the rising demand for cancer checks. The aim is to spot the disease at an early stage when treatments and surgery are often successful. But while the figures suggest that progress is being made, medical charities said it was vital for the government to address chronic understaffing and bolster the number of cancer specialists in the NHS as it “declares a national war on cancer” in its 10-Year Cancer Plan. Minesh Patel, the head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: “It is reassuring to see record numbers of people coming forward with cancer symptoms for these lifesaving checks. However, people living with cancer are often missing out on crucial care as a result of chronic NHS understaffing. “To avoid putting further pressure on hardworking doctors and nurses, it’s vital the government includes steps in the upcoming 10-Year Cancer Plan to grow the number of cancer professionals, so that people living with cancer receive the quality and timely care they desperately need,” he said. MPs on the Commons health and social care committee last month criticised the government’s failure to tackle NHS staff shortages, warning that hundreds of thousands of cancer patients in England face a late cancer diagnosis in the coming years, threatening to reduce survival rates from the disease. The 52-page report found that, without further action, 340,000 patients will be denied an early cancer diagnosis between 2019 and 2028. The warning followed a House of Commons library analysis in February that found half a million people in England with suspected cancer would wait longer than the intended two-week maximum to see a cancer specialist this year. Ian Walker, the executive director of policy at Cancer Research UK, said: “We know that the pandemic has had a devastating impact on cancer services and cancer waiting times were being missed before the pandemic struck. It’s very encouraging to see an increased number of people being referred for cancer checks. “But it’s vital that the efforts of NHS staff are bolstered in the government’s forthcoming 10-year Cancer Plan. Our ambitions to dramatically improve early diagnosis of cancer in this country are dependent on it.” Prof Peter Johnson, the National Clinical Director for Cancer at NHS England, said GPs had referred patients for cancer checks in record numbers in the past year and had been working hard to make sure people with worrying symptoms can see a specialist. “It’s vital people continue to come forward,” he said. “If you have a sign or symptom that you’re worried about, such as a persistent cough that is not Covid, or prolonged discomfort in the abdomen, please come forward. Getting checked out could save your life.”",News/Society,"30,000 cancer patients waiting for treatment in England",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/02/30000-cancer-patients-waiting-for-treatment-in-england

Begin your search as twilight begins to fall, and look low towards the western horizon. By 9pm, you should be able to see the three celestial objects. Aldebaran is a red giant star some 65 light years from Earth. It is the brightest star in the constellation Taurus, the Bull. In contrast, at roughly 170,000 miles (380,000km) away, the moon is just 1.25 light seconds distant. On this particular night, it will be a beautiful new moon, with just 3.5% of its visible surface illuminated. Catching a glimpse of this alone would make the effort worthwhile. But the real prize tonight lies just beyond: the inner planet Mercury. Currently situated 72m miles from Earth, Mercury is 6.4 light minutes away. Although this trio will be setting rapidly, those with a particularly low horizon should keep watching. If the air is still, around 21.33 BST, the Pleiades star cluster may also just be visible beyond Mercury. The chart shows the view looking west-north-west from London at 21.00 BST.

5/2/2022,"Dressed in a T-shirt and casual sweater with a tan and slicked back hair, Michael Murray is joking with the camera crew as he films a clip for social media surrounded by floor-to-ceiling glass walls in the London headquarters of Frasers Group. As the 32-year-old former nightclub promoter takes the reins at the retail business that owns Sports Direct, House of Fraser and Flannels this week, there could not be a clearer indication of the change of image at the top of the company founded by Murray’s father-in-law to be, Mike Ashley. Ashley, Frasers’ controlling shareholder who will remain an executive director on the board, has a difficult relationship with the media, rarely giving interviews or holding press conferences. Before floating Sports Direct in 2007, he was so reclusive that the only photograph of him available was from the 1970s, when he was a county squash coach. Since then, Ashley has appeared in front of MPs and fronted annual presentations to analysts and the media, but is clearly uncomfortable in the spotlight and runs Frasers as a quasi private company under the thumb of his now 67% stake. In contrast, Murray posts updates on the business on social media, such as pictures of a meeting with Hugo Boss executives in Germany last month, and gives detailed interviews with the press outlining his thoughts on the business’s strategic direction. Eschewing the company’s cut-price heritage, Murray spent millions of pounds on a new central London headquarters and flagship for the luxury Flannels chain and funded glossy ads for Sports Direct featuring celebrity athletes, including tennis champ Emma Raducanu and footballer Jack Grealish. In his latest LinkedIn profile, Murray announces plans to “accelerate the group’s strategy” with a vision “to serve our customers with the world’s best sports, premium and luxury brands”. Murray, who has collected more than £33m in payouts over the last four years under a controversial pay scheme linked to the value he created from a string of property deals, will certainly be incentivised to do well. He is in line for a £100m bonus if he more than doubles Frasers’ share price to £15 by 2025. The new pay deal underlines a meteoric rise for Murray who began by helping Ashley with personal property deals a few years after meeting his daughter Anna on holiday in 2011. His career kicked off with running festivals and student nights while still at Reading University after attending Sedbergh private school in Cumbria. No doubt inspired by his father, a property developer who is Doncaster’s biggest landlord, he also invested in two bars while still a student. Working as a consultant to Frasers, Murray has had an important role in building Flannels from a small regional brand into a chain of about 50 stores. Those who have dealt with Murray describe him as bright with a polished manner and clear ideas about how Frasers should move forward. “He’s a more acceptable version of Mike Ashley,” says one former worker. “He’s charming and quite measured, and knows what he’s about. But this is a very big gig for him.” Another says Murray’s efforts are more about improving the surface image in a way that will appeal to brands rather than the world for workers behind the scenes. “Removing Mike Ashley is just an image thing. [Murray] is almost like a mini Mike, an apprentice. My perception was he is never calling the shots, just the one doing the grunt work.” Whoever is truly setting the strategy, Frasers has a battle on to keep brands such as Nike and Adidas happy without profits tanking. With shoppers’ spare cash potentially in short supply and inflation on pay, the cost of goods and transport, it could prove an uphill task. Most Sports Direct stores still require updating while there are also serious challenges to tackle at House of Fraser, the ailing department store Ashley snapped up in 2018 that requires big investment or more hacking back. The chain has already shrunk to less than 40 outlets from 59 on acquisition, and industry insiders say investment is on hold with more stores likely to be converted to Flannels or shelved. Its diminishing scale makes the rationale for recent acquisitions of ailing brands – which could be useful in a mid-market department store such as Jack Wills and Sofa.com – look like rather expensive diversions. In a tight labour market, Frasers has a way to go to improve its image as an employer after years of concern about low pay and accusations of maltreatment of staff in stores and at its huge Shirebrook warehouse. As well as attracting and retaining talent, it must deal with investors that have never been more concerned about environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. “He has got to be a force for ESG improvement or he will find the pool of investors will shrink. It is in everybody’s interest to focus on that,” says Jonathan Pritchard, a retail analyst at Peel Hunt. Murray has certainly attempted to turn around Frasers’ image on staff relations, with a generous bonus scheme for 1,000 top staff – albeit with the rather stretching target of the group’s share price staying above £10 for 30 consecutive days in the next four years. The last time it came close to that was in 2014. Bringing about a real change in culture will require some tricky political manoeuvring to keep the benefit of Ashley’s undoubted retail expertise within a more modern environment. Pritchard says: “[Murray] has to demonstrate he can make strategic decisions of his own. I’ve no doubt he can but he has to cut the puppet strings without sacking the puppeteer.”",News/Business,‘A more acceptable Mike Ashley’: Sports Direct’s owner gets a new boss,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/02/a-more-acceptable-mike-ashley-sports-directs-owner-gets-a-new-boss
5/2/2022,"I’m part of a generation used to living their life in full view – our collective adolescence measured in a succession of messaging apps and social networks. Each of them encouraged increasing levels of openness and entrenched the message: sharing prompts caring or, better yet, attention. For much of my life, almost everything became fodder to be shared online. Funny texts from friends, videos of strangers on the street, stray thoughts about sexual proclivities. Privacy, both mine and that of the people I came into contact with, was a mythical concept. If I had experienced something, surely that made it my anecdote, to do with as I pleased? This approach caused problems. A man I was dating texted me to ask if a particular rant about bad communicators was about him (yes). A colleague warned me about sharing pictures in my underwear, prompting a furious reaction. Family fractures resulted from drunk tweets. But why, I would think defiantly, should I censor myself? Over the past two years, though, something has changed: I’ve started to properly pull back, prompted by the ongoing presence in my life of someone I love very deeply, whose attitude to privacy is the antithesis of mine. I had learned to see sharing as widely as possible as an act of pride. To me, posting a candid photograph to 10,000 followers was akin to loudly claiming my beloved for the world to see. He took a different view: attention from faceless avatars meant nothing to him. Why, he asked, did I feel compelled to perform my life for these people? It was a good question and one I wasn’t quite able to articulate an answer to, becoming defensive at first. Even now, I’m not sure there’s a single way to understand the drive to broadcast every facet of my existence. Perhaps the simplest explanation is that oversharing was a behaviour I learned early – as a toddler, my mother tells me I would run around, pointing at people and announcing what genitalia I surmised they had, informed by the iconic 1973 kids’ sex education book Where Did I Come From? – and engaging in it resulted in an incredible amount of positive reinforcement as I grew older. There are other reasons of course: realisations and breakthroughs I’ve had since beginning the process of redrawing my boundaries. But I’ll keep those to myself. Another factor was starting out as a lifestyle journalist in the twilight of the 2010s. A first-person essay boom was in full swing and leveraging your personal life was one of the few routes to get noticed if you lacked contacts or journalism qualifications. Young women desperate to stand out from the crowd were coaxed into sharing intimate, and often traumatic, details about their lives for clicks. In this arena, to lay yourself bare was an act of ambition – one, we later discovered, that can be difficult to scrub from the internet. Meanwhile, a new crop of digital-first and reality TV celebrities had emerged, defined by their “authenticity’” and willingness to present their entire existence for public consumption. Positive reinforcement for laying it all on the metaphorical table was high. Reprogramming yourself is a fascinating exercise. The urge to share is most insistent when I’m alone, prompting the horrific realisation that somewhere along the way, my brain has been trained to process reality through an audience. Sharing became how I made my own life real; if a tree fell in a forest, and I didn’t tweet about it, did it even happen? At times, I feel like something terrible and irreversible has taken place; that I’ll never be able to walk down a street listening to a beautiful piece of music and not get the urge to convert the sheer joy of the experience into a social media post, or a text to a friend to make it real. But every time I resist that grubby pull, there’s a small rush of triumph – and liberation. Now I’ve had a taste of what keeping things close feels like, I crave it. It’s a delicious secret, a reclamation of power I wasn’t aware I’d surrendered. Choosing what to share, with who and when, prompts necessary pauses – do I really need to mention this detail? Is this information I want out there long term? Do I even have the necessary consent to trumpet a certain story to all and sundry? None of this means I’ve stopped sharing altogether. That would be a lonely life indeed. But I have become far more selective about exactly what information reaches an audience wider than my inner circle (and I’m not alone; there is a burgeoning backlash against oversharing, counting Taylor Swift and some UK teens among its converts). Last year, I read the playwright Joe Orton’s diaries, published after his 1967 murder. As detailed in John Lahr’s introduction to The Orton Diaries, Orton always intended for posthumous publication of the work and believed “the value of a diary was its frankness”. His entries are the last word in confessional writing. But they were penned safe in the knowledge that the public would only read them after Orton was long gone. As a result, the man who jumps off the page feels utterly free, for better or worse. I’m now realising that complete openness was limiting. Privacy is a cloak, under which we are at liberty to explore the intricacies of the self, beholden to no audience other than ourselves. I have grown up in a generation that overshares in order to be heard. Only through the slow, gruelling process of learning to be private am I really beginning to listen to myself.

5/2/2022,"The education secretary will write to schools this week to urge them to use the government’s flagship national tutoring programme (NTP), which has been criticised for failing to help disadvantaged pupils. The department for education (DfE) also announced it would publish data showing how each school is using the programme, and that this would be shared with Ofsted. It said that during this academic year, an estimated 40% of schools are yet to offer any tutoring sessions through the NTP, a key part of the government’s £5bn post-pandemic education recovery programme. In a letter to schools, published on Monday, Nadhim Zahawi wrote: “Starting this week, my department will contact those schools yet to offer tutoring support to discuss their plans and offer further support to ensure they can offer tutoring to their pupils this term. “As part of my desire to ensure greater transparency of the impact of the programme, I am planning to publish data on each school’s tutoring delivery at the end of the year alongside the funding allocations and numbers of pupils eligible for the pupil premium.” The tutoring programme has previously been criticised as “dysfunctional”, with schools and tuition providers reporting problems accessing the scheme managed by Randstad, a Dutch human resources firm awarded £25.4m to run it. It links schools with approved tuition providers via a platform that many schools have struggled to access. More than a million tuition courses have been started during the 2021/22 academic year, but just over 100,000 of these were started through the Randstad route. The majority were through the schools-led tuition route, where schools were awarded funding to spend on tuition directly. In March the government severed its contract with Randstad for the next academic year, with the DfE announcing schools would instead receive direct funds for tutoring to “simplify” the programme, something headteachers had been calling for from the outset. A total of £349m has been allocated for the NTP for 2022/23. The government has previously said it aimed for its tutoring programme to help 90% of pupils leaving primary school to meet expected literacy and numeracy targets by 2030, as set out in its Levelling Up paper. A “parent pledge” announced in the Schools white paper also assured parents that any child falling behind in English and maths would be given targeted support. A report by the education select committee in March said MPs had “huge concerns” over Randstad’s ability to meet the targets it was set and that the NTP is said to have reached just 15% of its overall target so far. Anne Longfield, the former children’s commissioner, said the report showed the government’s response to Covid catchup had been “haphazard, unambitious and mired in bureaucracy”, with deprived and vulnerable children at risk of being left further behind.",News/Education,Schools urged to adopt maligned National Tutoring Programme,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/02/schools-urged-to-adopt-maligned-national-tutoring-programme
5/2/2022,"It’s Saturday morning and a group of women are standing in a nervous huddle, waiting to see if the vases and bowls they popped into the kiln last week have survived. “That came out really nice,” says one student. “Oh, wow!” proclaims another, holding up a small bowl. “I’m so proud of me.” Freya Bramble-Carter, their 30-year-old teacher, looks on at this studio in Kingsgate Workshops, in London, like a mother watching her children make fairy cakes for the first time. “It’s really fun seeing their reactions,” she says. “Especially after they’ve applied the glaze. Then the clay’s been through all of its transformations.” An artist and a teacher, Bramble-Carter recently showed her work at the Collect art fair in London. Channel 4 viewers may also remember her from the 2017 series of The Great Pottery Throw Down, which she exited after failing to make a successfully flushing toilet. She has more than 26,000 followers on Instagram and is much admired in this class. Watching her at the wheel, gracefully turning a ball of wet clay into the beginnings of an elegant vessel, one of her pupils refers to her as “the goddess of pottery”. She studied at Chelsea College of Arts, but it was her father, Chris Bramble, who has been teaching ceramics for 30 years, who passed on his craft to his daughter and her twin sister, also a ceramicist and performance artist. It’s hard to get a place in Freya and Chris’s classes at the moment. “They’re always booked up,” says Emily, one of today’s pupils. “You have to keep trying.” That’s because, of late, the world has gone potty for pots. Ceramics are on fire. The craft that was until fairly recently associated with a lumpy 1970s earnestness, and shoved to the back of the cabinet of embarrassments throughout the minimalist 1990s and 2000s, has re-emerged and is now deemed to be hot. The oddity of this modern appreciation for one of civilisation’s most ancient activities – just a short anthropological move from hunting and gathering – is perhaps best expressed in the number of mega-celebrities who have expressed a passion for getting their hands dirty. Serena Williams admitted on social media, back in 2019, that she was “really getting into pottery”. Actor Seth Rogen became so enthused by pots during lockdown that he built a studio in his garage and sells his own ceramic marijuana paraphernalia. Brad Pitt doesn’t just sculpt in clay, he uses other materials, apparently while listening to Frank Ocean – he is also sometimes joined by Leonardo DiCaprio. Laura Harrier, star of Spider-Man: Homecoming, has her own pottery studio, while Josh O’Connor, who played Prince Charles in The Crown, regularly posts pottery appreciations on Instagram, praising the late Lucie Rie. An acclaimed British ceramics artist, formerly only known to a niche audience, Rie’s name is now nodded at sagely by anyone who’s bought a four-set of wobbly cereal bowls from a clay-splashed parent at the school fair. In fashion circles, it’s got to the point where you’re no one if you haven’t already launched a micro collection of organic-form vessels. Last year, the designer Jonathan Anderson, a ceramics collector and superfan, collaborated with both the Kenyan-born, Surrey-based artist Dame Magdalene Odundo, known for her handbuilt, highly burnished works, and young American ceramics star Shawanda Corbett on a collection of blankets for the JW Anderson autumn/winter 2021 collection. French designer Isabel Marant has stopped working on Mondays so that she can pursue a ceramics practice in her own recently completed pottery studio. “I don’t want to make any business out of it,” she says. “It’s the realisation of a dream and very satisfying to me. Although I think my friends are going to be pissed off because they won’t get clothes as presents any more – they’ll get ceramics.” Henry Holland, the former London fashion week star who has dressed the likes of Alexa Chung and Rita Ora, has moved over to the kiln-fired fun side entirely. When his fashion brand, House of Holland, went into administration at the start of the pandemic, he sought creative solace in a bag of clay. The morning after he’d posted a few pictures of some stripy bowls on social media, he woke up to 150 orders and is now at the helm of a new ceramics enterprise, a collection of graphic tableware made from contrasting coloured clays in the Japanese tradition of nerikomi, sold by, among others, Liberty and Soho Home. “The ceramics industry across the country is flying,” he says. “When I’m asking my suppliers if they can create new colours for me, they’re saying, ‘We don’t need any new business.’ They’re totally overwhelmed. There’s a resurgence in homewares in general, and hand-making processes and craft, a move away from mass production. People are becoming much more aware of what they’re buying and attaching more emotion to objects. And I’m not going to lie: it’s definitely increased in relevance because of Throw Down.” Jovial, inclusive and messy, The Great Pottery Throw Down, which recently broadcast its fifth series on Channel 4 after launching on BBC Two in 2015, has done much to educate Britons about ceramics, making them as au fait with the dangers of floppy rims as they are with Bake-Off’s soggy bottoms. Helen Ritchie is a curator at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, which holds the country’s most important collection of European, Middle Eastern and Far Eastern ceramics, and is exhibiting Odundo’s works and inspirations. She sees more engagement with ceramics from visitors these days. “They ask more questions about how things are made,” says Ritchie. “They’re not just walking past saying, ‘Nice pot.’ Although I think people do find it easier to have an opinion about ceramics in a way that they won’t about a painting because they’re such familiar objects. We all have ceramics at home. Everyone uses ceramics on a daily basis.” She cites two prominent artists – and brilliant communicators – who have brought ceramics to the fore: Edmund de Waal and Grayson Perry. “De Waal is writing books, Grayson’s on the telly, so you’ve got these well-known people talking about pottery and making it popular.” As a result, she says, traditional fine art galleries have started showing more ceramics, and collectors who wouldn’t previously have invested are buying. Ceramics are increasingly being sold in fine art auctions, too. Odundo, whose work has made it into this year’s Venice Biennale, continues to keep smashing her own record price for a single work by a living ceramic artist: her Angled Mixed Coloured vessel fetched £240,000 in November 2020. But away from lofty galleries and six-figure price bombs, there’s a sense that pottery can give us all something more, that its earthiness reaches the parts that other arts, crafts and even jobs cannot reach – even if the job in question is starring in hit Hollywood films or winning the tennis grand slam. “Honestly,” said Rogen of his pottery habit, “I was surprised at how much I got from it. It forces you to be very present.” In a predominantly digital world its tactility has rising appeal. “The physicality and sense of accomplishment is so rewarding,” says Holland. “When I was a designer, I was so far removed from the actual making of garments. I’d work with my team in the studio on fitting the samples, but then you’re just waiting for factories to manufacture them. Whereas now I go into the studio and a lump of mud is all I need for a finished piece.” Back at Kingsgate Workshops, Maryam Pasha, a “storyteller” and director of TEDxLondon and TEDxLondonWomen, is about to glaze a vase she made in late Owen blue. “I like that you have to be patient and don’t always know what is going to happen,” she says. “I find that as you get older, you rarely do things you’re bad at, so it’s teaching you a bit of patience.” In her day job, Pasha helps scientists and experts communicate about the climate crisis. “It’s pretty heavy,” she says. “Here I have three hours where I don’t have to look at my phone. I cannot think about anything else – because if you come into the studio and you’re distracted, it’s a disaster. You have to leave all that outside. It’s a type of active meditation. It lets you be in your hands rather than in your head.”  Chris Bramble and Freya Bramble-Carter are exhibiting at the Queens Park Art Centre pottery festival, Aylesbury, until 18 May – with a live demonstration on 14 May.",Arts/Art and design,Pot heads: why everyone’s fired up about ceramics,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/02/pot-heads-why-everyones-fired-up-about-ceramics

Looming over almost every part is Arthur’s Seat, which Robert Louis Stevenson judged a hill in size, but “a mountain in virtue of its bold design”. It’s this eternally reassuring presence in Edinburgh’s civic space that puts me at ease. The volcanic plug creates a sense of a natural landscape and near-tranquillity, despite the encircling thrum from over 540,000 people. It may be enmeshed in human ideas – such as the Camelot connotations of the name – but physically it carries deeper, rich links to the wild. There are the seismic trauma of its birth and the underlying fact of its 340m-year endurance. From many angles it’s thought to resemble a resting lion (I’d suggest a magnificent old lioness), with her raised forehead as the hill’s 250-metre summit. At any season there is a constant traffic of people to that spot; in effect, to be a flea in a big cat’s ear. I usually forgo the crowded summit for something more wonderful: her coat of sun-simmering yellow. Right now the whole hill is a blaze of gorse blossom. It is odd that a such an essentially militant plant should cloak itself in the densest, most delicate flowers. I don’t think I have ever encountered gorse with more profuse blooms. It’s as if the plant knows the iconic status of its location. Should the Scots ever choose independence (and why on earth wouldn’t they?) I propose Arthur’s Seat as the symbol for the nation. From its summit you can see the whole Firth of Forth and beyond. True, there are the old castle and the new national parliament complex, but in 10,000 years’ time, which of these will still stand? I’m putting my money on solid Carboniferous magma. Besides, which of those three has a self-renewing ability to make Edinburgh’s spring air heavenly with the thick scent of vanilla and coconut?
