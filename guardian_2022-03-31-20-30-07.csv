3/31/2022,"British nationals living overseas for more than 15 years are set to get the right to vote in UK general elections, after a proposed change in the law passed a critical stage in the House of Lords. The move will end a 20-year battle by 100-year-old Harry Shindler who challenged the 15-year limit on voting rights in the high court in 2016 and in the European court of justice in 2018. It will also deliver a promise made by the Conservative party in successive election manifestos. Alistair Lexden, who championed the cause, said: “Three manifestos, and now close to being delivered. The Bill is expected to become law before the (now imminent) end of the current session.” Shindler, who lives in Rome, said: “I am delighted and pleased this is nearly over. We are a democracy, but not a complete democracy while we didn’t have the right to vote,” said Shindler from his home in Rome. The move could give the right to 3 million Britons retired or working abroad. “I’ve been campaigning for this for the last 18 years. And although it has to go back to the House of Commons, it’s now as good as a done deed. This is a historic moment and Britons all over the world will be celebrating,” said Shindler. Although he received a letter from Boris Johnson last year promising him that the Tories would finally deliver on their promise, he was not confident the bill would get through the parliamentary schedule. The relevant clauses in Elections bill have now passed the committee stage in the House of Lords after amendments on this issue were debated but withdrawn. The bill will now proceed to the report stage where it is scrutinised for any legal loopholes before returning to the House of Commons for a final vote. While Shindler and campaigners express delight, others say the bill was a terrible mishmash of rights and predict further reforms in two or three years’ time. Some peers said it would be unfair that some Britons who lived abroad for many decades would get to vote in the British general elections while many foreign nationals living and paying tax in the UK could not. Paul Scriven, a Liberal Democrat life peer, said: “Can the minister explain how that would be perceived as fair and a good platform for our electoral process? “People who have not lived here for 50 years will have the right to vote and influence government policy, even though it does not directly affect them.” William Wallace of Saltaire, also for the Lib Dems, said the government did not go far enough to rationalise “the tangle of voting rights left by imperial history” that gave voting rights to some foreign nationals such as commonwealth citizens but not others. Meghnad Desai told fellow peers he had qualified to vote when he arrived in 1965 because, he learned, Indians had the right “as subjects of the monarch”. But he said it was not clear what entitled some to vote and not others questioning whether it should derive from someone’s status as local taxpayer, or residency rights. “Until the muddle is clarified, we will have to proceed with a compromised mishmash of rights,” he said.",News/UK news,Britons living overseas for 15 years get the right to vote in UK elections,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/31/britons-living-overseas-for-15-years-get-the-right-to-vote-in-uk-elections
3/31/2022,"Low-wage migrant workers have been forced to pay billions of dollars inrecruitment fees to secure their jobs in World Cup host nation Qatar over the past decade, a Guardian investigation has found. Bangladeshi men migrating to Qatar are likely to have paid about $1.5bn (£1.14bn) in fees, and possibly as high as $2bn, between 2011 and 2020. Nepali men are estimated to have paid around $320m, and possibly more than $400m, in the four years between mid-2015 to mid-2019. The total cost incurred by Qatar’s low-wage migrant workforce is likely to be far higher because workers from other labour-sending countries in south Asia and Africa also pay high fees. With just months to go until the World Cup kicks off, the findings reveal the scale of exploitation endured by some of the world’s poorest workers, including many who have been employed on World Cup-related construction and hospitality projects. The figures, which have been calculated by the Guardian and corroborated by a number of labour rights groups, are an estimate based on the prevalence and cost of recruitment fees and related expenses reported by numerous human rights groups and labour experts between 2014 and 2022. The charging of recruitment fees is illegal in Qatar and – beyond a maximum limit – in Nepal and Bangladesh, but the practice is widespread and deeply entrenched. It is commonplace in all the Gulf countries. The figures calculated by the Guardian include all fees, including those within the maximum limit. It takes different forms, but often sees companies or brokers in Qatar and recruitment agents in labour-sending countries colluding to force workers into paying for their own recruitment. The fees are paid to agents in workers’ home countries before departure. Migrants from Bangladesh and Nepal, who make up around a third of Qatar’s 2-million strong foreign workforce, typically pay fees of $3,000 to $4,000 and $1,000 to $1,500 respectively. This means that many low-wage workers from Bangladesh – who can earn as little as $275 a month – have to work for at least a year just to pay off their recruitment fees. Workers often have to take out high-interest loans or sell land to afford the fees, leaving them vulnerable to debt bondage – a form of modern slavery – as they are unable to leave their jobs until the debt has been repaid. Despite the costs, hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi and Nepali workers continue to seek work in the Gulf and beyond each year, largely due to a lack of jobs and low wages at home. Many pay the fees knowing the risks but calculating that it will pay off in the long term. Their dilemma was plain to see in the departure hall at Kathmandu’s international airport, where workers made hurried video calls to their families, thick red “tikka” smeared on their foreheads; a symbol of good wishes from friends. “I’m feeling really worried,” said one worker, going abroad for the first time. “But I have to go. I have money problems.” Another, taking up a construction job in Qatar, waved goodbye to his baby son on his phone. “I’m so sad to be leaving my children,” he said. “I paid 150,000 [Nepalese] rupees [NPR] [$1,230]. The agent told me, ‘If you want to go, you have to pay’.” The Qatari authorities say they have taken steps to address the problem by opening recruitment centres in eight countries, starting in 2018, where workers must go to complete various administrative tasks and sign their contracts before departure. While the centres may have reduced the incidence of “contract substitution” – where workers find different terms and conditions in Qatar to what they were promised at home – experts said they have done little to curb recruitment fees, because these are paid much earlier in the recruitment process. A 2021 report on recruitment between Nepal and Qatar led by migrant rights group FairSquare said Qatar has “largely seen recruitment and fee payment as an origin state concern, and recruiters have generally been subject to relatively limited regulation”. However, the local organising committee of the World Cup introduced a scheme in 2018 to ensure companies with stadium contracts repay the recruitment fees of their workers, as well as some workers on other projects. Workers are not required to show proof that they have paid fees, which is almost impossible to do given that the practice is illegal. Companies have pledged to repay roughly $28.5m to about 49,000 workers. So far around $22m has been reimbursed. The number of workers who will benefit, however, is only a tiny fraction of the total in Qatar. In many cases, the repayments only cover part of the recruitment fees, and do not provide any additional compensation or account for the cost of the workers’ loans. The Guardian understands the scheme has also not been extended to thousands of workers in the hospitality sector who are playing a direct role in the World Cup. Last year, the Guardian interviewed workers in Fifa-endorsed hotels who said they had paid recruitment fees of up to $2,750. The supreme committee organising the World Cup said in a statement, “We remain committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable, and lasting labour reforms.” Narad Nath Bharadwaj, a former Nepal ambassador to Qatar, called the practice a “gruesome story”, saying more than 90% of workers pay fees. “Payment is illegal and mostly takes place under the table, so the workers have no proof they have paid. But they are unable to get a job if they do not pay 150,000 or 200,000 NPR. For better jobs the rate is higher,” he said. While some workers are recruited for free or minimal cost, the vast majority are forced to pay; often victims of deals between employers and agents in Qatar and a chain of recruiters and brokers in Nepal and Bangladesh. In some cases, employers or agents in Qatar secure visas to recruit workers and then demand kickbacks of about $300 to $500 for each worker from agents in labour-sending countries in exchange for the visas, the cost of which is passed on to workers. A report for the Qatar Foundation said: “The costs borne by workers … are essentially ‘bribes’ demanded (extorted) by recruitment agents to secure the jobs in Qatar for which they enter into debt with high-interest rates.” Bangladeshi workers, like Aman Ullah, pay by far the highest fees. In 2016, Ullah was charged 360,000 taka ($4,190) for a job in Qatar. He was promised work as a welder on a monthly wage of 2,500 Qatari rial ($686), but on arrival, he was taken out to the desert to work on a farm for 800 rial. “There was no limit to the work,” he said. “We had no electricity or air-conditioning and were not allowed to leave the compound.” His employer would not let him return home until he begged for permission to visit his sick mother. Back in Bangladesh, with nothing to show for his time in Qatar, his debt had ballooned to 800,000 taka forcing him to take out further loans to pay off the original debt. Even in death, workers are not released from their recruitment debt. Hoping to earn money for his daughter’s dowry, Mahamad Nadaf Mansur Dhuniya, from Nepal, paid an agent 150,000 NPR for a construction job in Qatar in 2018. He could only afford the fee by taking out a loan with an annual interest rate of 48%. Last year, he was found hanging in his workplace. His wife, Mairul Khatun, is unsure why he killed himself. “I think it may have been the pressure of the loan, his daughter’s marriage, the need to look after his family,” she said, from her home in southern Nepal. Her hands and feet are smeared in mud from labouring in the nearby fields, for which she earns 300 NPR a day and a few potatoes, which lie on the ground beside her. She may have lost her husband, but his debt remains. “I have a lot of tension now. Before, we sometimes ate meat and milk but we’ve stopped now. How can we afford these things?” Khatun said. “I can’t sleep at night.” The Qatar government said companies involved in illegal recruitment practices have been severely punished. Twenty four recruitment agencies were recently shut down and had their licences revoked for breaking Qatar’s laws. A spokesperson said: “There are complex challenges that need to be overcome to protect economic migrants globally, including in Europe. For its part, Qatar is committed to eradicating illegal recruitment practices in its labour market and supporting efforts to tackle abuse and exploitation throughout the global economy.” Dr Ahmed Munirus Saleheen of Bangladesh’s ministry of expatriates’ welfare and overseas employment said: “The government of Bangladesh is strongly committed to ensuring safe, orderly, regular and responsible work migration.” He blamed “visa trading” by middlemen in both the country of origin and destination for the high cost of recruitment and said legal action was immediately taken against recruitment agencies when complaints of unfair recruitment practices were received.

3/31/2022,"The websites of several energy suppliers have crashed, as customers rushed to send in meter readings before prices rise by more than 50% at midnight. British Gas, EDF, E.ON, SSE and Scottish Power all appeared to be struggling with the volume of submissions from households looking to beat the deadline. With energy bills due to rise by an average of 54% from Friday, millions of households have been urged to take gas and electricity meter readings the day before, to ensure they get the current, cheaper rates for all the energy they use right up until close of play on Thursday.

The site was still inaccessible on Thursday, displaying a “proxy error” message. There were also reports that the app was down. SSE customers trying to send in readings were greeted with a message that said: “Sorry, we’re working on this part of our website.” Customers also reported difficulty submitting readings to EDF, E.ON and Scottish Power. At midnight on Thursday, the energy regulator Ofgem is increasing the price cap, the maximum annual charge for gas and electricity. An average home on a default tariff paying by direct debit will be hit with an increase of £693, or 54%, to £1,971, a rise that has prompted widespread concern about the spiralling cost-of-living crisis. Experts have said stubbornly high gas prices, exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, could mean that bills rise to £3,000 at the next price cap decision in October.

3/31/2022,"Water companies discharged raw sewage into English rivers 372,533 times last year, a slight reduction on the previous year. The water companies covering England released untreated sewage for a combined total of more than 2.7m hours; compared with 3.1m hours in 2020, according to data released by the Environment Agency (EA) on Thursday. The data was published as the government announced what it said was the largest overhaul of the sewer system since the 1990s to tackle the problem of discharges. The government said the Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan was a step change in how water companies tackled the number of discharges of untreated sewage, which the government and the public have made clear are unacceptable. The target in the plan is to eliminate 40% of raw sewage overflows into rivers by 2040. Untreated sewage and rainwater should only be released into rivers and coastal waters via storm overflow pipes in extreme weather to relieve pressure in the sewage system. But evidence over the last three years has shown water companies are routinely using the overflows to discharge untreated sewage rather than treating it. The environment secretary, George Eustice, said: “We are the first government to set out our expectation that that water companies must take steps to significantly reduce storm overflows. Today, we are setting specific targets to ensure that those storm overflows are used only in exceptional circumstances – delivering on our Environment Act and building on wider work on water quality.” But critics said the plan – which was launched for consultation on Thursday – lacked urgency. Mark Lloyd, CEO of the Rivers Trust: “I’m disappointed that this plan lacks the urgency we so desperately need. This plan is going to need strong input from civil society and NGOs like the Rivers Trust if it is going to outpace the twinned climate and nature crises we are currently facing. We want to have rivers where people and wildlife can thrive, but the target timelines in the plan are far too slow – I want to see this my lifetime!” Data released by the EA on Thursday showed that 10 water companies covering England and Wales were still releasing raw sewage into waterways for hundreds of thousands of hours in 2021. The 372,533 spills were only those recorded by event duration monitors on the overflows. The monitoring is in place on 12,608 of the 14,707 overflows – 89% of the total. More than 60 discharges a year from an overflow are considered too high and should trigger an investigation. On average, 14% of discharges from the 10 water companies surpassed that limit. Water companies are under investigation by Ofwat and the EA after they admitted they may have illegally released untreated sewage into rivers and waterways. This investigation will involve more than 2,000 sewage treatment works, nearly a third of the total number in England and Wales, with any company caught breaching their legal permits liable to enforcement action, including fines or prosecutions. Fines can be up to 10% of annual turnover for civil cases, or unlimited in criminal proceedings. Hugo Tagholm, CEO of Surfers Against Sewage, said the government’s consultation published on Thursday was not tackling the problem quickly enough. “The level of public outrage on the sewage pollution scandal continues to grow by the day, yet we’re seeing a consultation today that provides us with targets and timeframes decades away,” he said. “The water industry must surely be forced to act faster, with a greater urgency to tackle their woeful pollution record that is contributing to the destruction of our rivers and coastline. This industry has already had over thirty years to act; we need to make sure they don’t have the opportunity to put their profits before the planet for the next thirty.” Richard Benwell, CEO of the Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “These figures show another year of our waterways being choked by sewage pollution. This must change, for our own health as well as that of plants and animals struggling to survive in our polluted waters.” Benwell also called for more urgency from government. He said: “If the government is serious about cleaning up our rivers, we need a hard deadline set in law to improve the overall quality of our waters and strong enforcement measures. “We must halt the most harmful pollution by 2030 and go further, faster to stem the flow of water pollution for people and wildlife.” United 81,588Yorkshire 70,062Severn Trent 59,684South West 42,484Northumbrian 36,483Wessex 23,532Anglian 21,351Southern 19,077Thames 14,713Welsh Water (in England) 3,567",News/Environment,Sewage released into English rivers for 2.7m hours last year by water firms,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/31/sewage-released-into-english-rivers-for-27m-hours-last-year-by-water-firms
3/31/2022,"Joseph Patel, the producer of music documentary Summer of Soul, has accused both Will Smith and Chris Rock of selfishness in overshadowing his film’s triumph on Sunday night at the Oscars. Patel, who produced the documentary alongside Robert Fyvolent, David Dinerstein and director Questlove, said he was “still trying to make sense” of the exchange, which saw Smith slap Rock for making a joke about his wife’s alopecia. The incident happened directly before the documentary results were announced. “I think what Will did was selfish,” wrote Patel on Twitter, in a now deleted thread. “It robbed the category of its moment. It robbed the other excellent and amazing films of their moment to be acknowledged in what was a STRONG year for docs. “And it robbed Summer of Soul and our team of our moment. Of a loud, enthusiastic cheer for a celebrated film.” Patel writes that he recalled walking on stage to accept the award and Smith hugging Questlove, who “handled the moment with grace, giving a speech from the heart.” He added: “What I didn’t hear in that moment walking to stage but was told of afterwards is what Chris Rock said when reading our name from the winner’s card – The winner is ‘Summer of Soul …Ahmir ‘Questlove’ Thompson and 4 white guys.” WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK????? “The reason that makes me SO SO VERY ANGRY is because I was so proud to be one of a handful of South Asians to have ever won an Oscar in the history of the award.” In fact, Patel was the third south Asian man to pick up an award that night, after Riz Ahmed and Aneil Karia. “So with my family and friends watching, Chris Rock lumped me in as 1 of ‘4 white guys. (Nevermind the disrespect to @d2films and @fyvo for not even saying their names, and the inaccuracy of us being 3 producers not 4),” Patel continued. Patel declined to put Rock’s joke down to discombobulation after the slap, as “he made the same joke the night before on stage at the Roots Jam!” “So I’m angry,” he wrote. “Angry at Will Smith. Angry at Chris Rock. Angry for me. Angry for Ahmir. Angry for my fellow film-makers. “I got back home to New York last night and saw the ceremony on my DVR and didn’t have the stomach to watch it. I probably never will.

3/31/2022,"Liza Minnelli’s first screen appearance was in this musical remake of The Shop Around the Corner, a vanishingly brief cameo as a three-year-old toddler. It’s full of poignant family significance and also uneasily prophetic, given that the adult Minnelli was all too often booked for nothing more than a celeb walk-on. The doe-eyed moppet appears in the film’s closing shot between Van Johnson and her real-life mother, Judy Garland; the pair, after their comedy-of-errors romance, are now assumed to be radiantly married parents. Little Liza is in an adorable white outfit: a mini-me getup matching her mother. Here is a role and a movie that most Minnelli fans (and, come to think of it, most Dudley Moore fans) prefer to pass over in silence. Lovable alcoholic Arthur is now married to Minnelli’s Linda, the shoplifter he fell for in the first film; he loses all his money but is offered the chance to get his wealth back if he divorces his true love (Minnelli) and marry someone else. Rather nobly, he refuses. It’s rather low energy and low on laughs, but Minnelli does at least carry a plausible supporting role. Another of Minnelli’s meta-cameos, this deleted scene surfaced many years afterwards, revealing that Scorsese had reunited his stars from New York, New York. Minnelli plays herself in the delusional Rupert Pupkin’s dream of being on the top-rated TV chatshow, hosted by the glowering star Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis). With some poise, she plays a deadpan straight-woman role, as blowhard Rupert continually interrupts her anecdotes. Minnelli would be a brilliant proper Muppet guest star: a Muppet Cabaret is the obvious choice. But in reality, all we got was this very brief cameo playing herself as Kermit enters the restaurant Sardi’s in New York. Kermit is pretending to be a bigshot producer, hoping to spread whispered rumours among the moneyed crowd that his show is the one to invest in. He sneakily takes Minnelli’s photo off the wall and replaces it with his own, just she sweeps in; she is deeply annoyed at being erased by the Muppet upstart. Mel Brooks’s all-star stunt-casting extravaganza was a silent movie featuring himself as a washed-up director who needs stars to appear in his planned silent movie. One star that he and his two buddies (Marty Feldman, Dom DeLuise) approach is Minnelli, who is one day eating lunch at that legendary place that had in 1976 not quite vanished from Hollywood mythology: the studio commissary. The three guys dressed as knights in armour clank up to her table, kicking off some uproarious physical comedy. Minnelli very gamely joins in. Fashion documentarist Frédéric Tcheng gave us this study of designer Roy Halston – creator of Jackie Kennedy’s pillbox hat – which had some interesting commentary from his great friend and ally Minnelli. She is being featured here in the role of an intelligent expert observer, rather than an opaque star commodity. The movie shows Minnelli’s own role in the history of fashion and her grasp of how costume works with choreography. “His clothes danced with you,” she says of Halston’s work. Albert Finney’s sole directorial outing was this very 1960s romp about a fashionable northern writer, Charlie (Finney), who becomes gigantically rich and famous and winds up in a mood of directionless despondency in his wealthy London habitat. Minnelli plays the American photographer who hangs out in his palatial modernist home, being glimpsed on the CCTV screens on which Charlie rather creepily keeps an eye on things, and cruises around with him in his Rolls, taking pictures of his depressed home town. Minnelli has to act opposite Finney and Colin Blakely, with whom she has no chemistry. Here is a cult oddity for Minnelli fans, but, in its way, an important link between her and her mother: an animated family musical inspired by L Frank Baum’s follow-up Oz novel from 1904, The Marvelous Land of Oz, with Minnelli voicing Dorothy and live-action sequences with Bill Cosby as the wizard. Very bizarrely, the opening credit sequence uses the dramatic library stock music The Awakening, by the British composer Johnny Pearson, which at the same time in the UK was being used as the ITN News at Ten theme tune. Minnelli’s career initially soared in tandem with that of Burt Reynolds and here she was reunited with the moustachioed hunk as co-star in this sparky if dated comedy thriller. Reynolds is the ex-cop busted out of the police when a case went horribly wrong for no real fault of his. Minnelli plays a sex worker (in the era when Hollywood loved the idea of sex workers being picturesque comedy types) who is the witness to a violent crime and hires Reynolds (now working humiliatingly as a shopping mall security guard) to protect her. Not too bad. Minnelli’s authentic late-performing masterpiece was on TV, as Lucille Austero in Arrested Development, which showed us her gift for eccentric comedy and allowed her to act, play dialogue scenes and get laughs with her away-with-the-fairies innocence. But this odd indie film comedy comes close. She plays Alyssa Donahue, a sex therapist who is consulted by the female lead, Parker Posey, who is not having orgasms. Minnelli leads a therapy group exploring the healing power of masturbation. All the world knows that the Sex and the City movies were an awful travesty and the second movie was appreciably worse than the first. And yet this much-hated sequel gave us Minnelli’s gem of a cameo, at the wedding of Stanford (played by the late Willie Garson) and Anthony (Mario Cantone). Minnelli not only officiates – inspired casting – but performs an uproarious version of Single Ladies, showing that, in terms of dance moves, she still had it. This was the film that was going to restore Minnelli’s prestige as the pre-eminent song’n’dance star of the movies, and if it didn’t exactly do that, it reminded everyone of her sweetness of soul and never-say-die attitude as well as bringing back the key Minnelli trope: the vulnerable yet courageous trooper who never loses faith that one day she’s gonna make it. She plays Mavis, a former Broadway dancer who is paying the bills by running a dance class in a New York church basement for a motley group of hopefuls including Julie Walters and Jane Krakowski. Cranky old Shelley Winters plays piano accompaniment. Money worries threaten the class until Minnelli hears about that time-honoured life-saver: a talent contest. Directed by Minnelli’s father, Vincente, in his final project, this musical fantasy was received coldly at the time, but is now appreciated for its visual richness and almost experimental favouring of image and mood over plot, an effect that may admittedly be down to the film being recut without Vincente’s permission. Minnelli plays the innocent chambermaid at a hotel in Rome where an ageing contessa capriciously decides to take the young woman under her wing and make a star of her, as a way of recapturing her own youth. This older woman is played by Ingrid Bergman. Two more different performers could hardly be imagined and there is perhaps no obvious chemistry between them, yet it’s a bold outing for Minnelli. Minnelli got a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in this comedy, made in that very 70s jazz-age nostalgia style. She plays a feisty widow whose husband ran a dodgy bar in Mexico during Prohibition. Chaotic events conspire to plant in her mind a desire to get into rum-running, which she does, in the company of the rogue with whom she was having an extramarital affair, Burt Reynolds, and also another scoundrel, played by Gene Hackman. Minnelli has a big song – Get While the Getting Is Good – which gives rein to the brassy cynicism and survivor psyche that she can convey with such gusto. This filmed New York concert, from the high point of Minnelli’s megacelebrity, was directed by Bob Fosse and shown about six months after Cabaret came out in cinemas, intended for TV only but shot on film not video. After its initial transmission, this film disappeared and was considered lost, until restoration began in 1999 with Minnelli’s permission as copyright holder. The show almost conflates Minnelli’s own personality with the ultra-chic big-city sophisticate Sally Bowles; Halston designed the costumes, and Kander & Ebb wrote the title song especially for this show, which in its jaunty what-the-hell bravura is very Sally Bowles, or very early-in-the-movie Sally at all events. Before her big breakthrough in the annus mirabilis of 1972, Minnelli had been making an impression in various serious roles in small-scale movies, and one of these was this challenging indie from Otto Preminger. She plays Junie, whose face has been scarred with acid, living in a kind of bohemian menage with a gay wheelchair-using man and another man with seizures. Aside from the way the film appears to elide homosexuality with disability for the purposes of an “issue” movie, it is very on-the-nose about the issues involved and Minnelli is made to do quirky, odd things such as a striptease in a cemetery. But she sells it hard, and it is the kind of demanding, uningratiating dramatic work that she was almost never asked to tackle again. Minnelli got a best actress Oscar nomination for this film from director Alan J Pakula, an earnest kind of Hollywood view of the younger generation, the student generation and the generation that were having sex before marriage. Minnelli is Pookie, a quirky, brainy type who meets up with another undergrad played by Wendell Burton; before long they are having a relationship that is brought to a crisis by her fear that she is pregnant. An interesting feature, almost a B-side to The Graduate in its way, without the predatory older characters. Here was another Golden Globe nomination for Minnelli (her career was made to be rewarded by the cheerfully vaudevillian Globes), playing Linda, the tough working-class woman who is a habitual shoplifter in Manhattan. Moore’s dissolute millionaire, Arthur, spots her trying to pinch something in a department store, gets her out of trouble with the management and strikes up a needy relationship, although she remains firmly unimpressed. Minnelli has to stand up to two scene-stealing Britons: Moore and no less a figure than Sir John Gielgud as the droll, Jeevesian manservant. Her honesty and American authenticity are the film’s emotional bedrock. Minnelli gave a terrific performance opposite Robert De Niro in this exciting and audacious movie from Scorsese – an old-school musical drama that in spirit came from the golden age. In New York after the work, Francine (Minnelli) is a struggling singer who falls for the pugnacious sax player Jimmy (De Niro); as the years go past, he becomes more and more impossible. Kander & Ebb composed Minnelli’s keynote song, New York, New York, which instantly became so iconic it’s hard to believe it dates from 1977. And Minnelli’s original was so different from Frank Sinatra’s cover. She brought to it all the gutsy, passionate yearning for survival and hope for the future that the city represents but unlike Frank, her “if” in “if I can make it there” still has human vulnerability and internal drama. Joel Grey’s raspingly sinister, demonic MC welcomes us to the cabaret at the Kit Kat Klub. With a crash of cymbals and a thump of piano keys, he brings on his star turn. The divinely decadent Sally Bowles saunters into view in her amazing outfit of bowler (a visual pun on “Bowles”?), black shorts and top like some sexified sense memory of lederhosen; black choker, stocking tops and boots – and lets us have it with Mein Herr, the gloriously dismissive, sensual opposite of a torch song, telling a pathetically infatuated boyfriend to get lost.

3/31/2022,"Companies led by women disproportionately attract less investment than those led by men, according to a large-scale study of female entrepreneurship in the UK. The Gender Index, which was launched on Thursday, is a research study of all 4.4m active UK companies and allows users to track the impact of female-led firms on the economy via an online, interactive tool. The data identified that just under 17% of all active companies are led by women, but they only managed to attract less than 12% of 1.3m investments made in UK firms. In comparison, 61% of active companies are led by men, and those firms attracted two-thirds (66%) of all investment. The remainder recorded 17% of investment obtained by firms led by a gender-balanced team, while 4.7% of investments were directed to companies where there was no information about gender of the leadership. The Gender Index website was conceived as a means of creating a benchmark of the current levels of activity by businesses led by women, ranging from startups to listed companies. The study found women-led companies not only were less likely to attract investment but also generated lower turnover than those run by their male counterparts, with average revenues of £1.3m a year, compared with £3.1m for businesses headed up by men. Yet this comes at a time when women are starting more companies than ever before: the Gender Index recorded 145,200 new companies founded by women in 2021, according to statistics provided by mnAI, which also provided data for 2022’s Rose Review into female entrepreneurship, authored by NatWest chief executive Alison Rose. . The Gender Index is chaired by Jill Pay, who has a background in business management and became the first woman to hold the position of serjeant at arms in the House of Commons in 2008. Pay said mapping the impact of female-founded companies was a first step towards “uncovering their potential and supporting their growth”, which is “paramount to a more inclusive, diverse and stronger economy”. She added: “We now have the ability to map every company in every country, region, LEP [local enterprise partnership] and local authority across the UK, by sector, in real-time. By making this information public, our ambition is to ensure that greater support is provided to female-founded companies, helping to accelerate and stimulate fiscal and corporate growth.”",News/Business,"UK firms run by women struggle to attract investment, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/31/uk-firms-run-by-women-struggle-to-attract-investment-gender-index
3/31/2022,"The BBC have announced a summer season of programming to mark the 60th anniversary of the Rolling Stones, including a series of new documentaries on each band member. My Life as a Rolling Stone will spend an hour on Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and the late Charlie Watts. According to the BBC, the films use “unseen footage and exclusive stories from Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood interwoven with new and archive interviews and performance”, while the Watts film is told through his bandmates and peers. Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, Steven Tyler, Chrissie Hynde, Slash and PP Arnold are among those who have contributed to the films, which will air on BBC Two. A new audio documentary, Rolling With the Stones, will air on Radio 2: a career-spanning retelling of the band’s story, drawing on hours of unheard archive interviews and interspersed with rare performance recordings. The BBC iPlayer will host two archive films. 2012’s Crossfire Hurricane is a documentary featuring new interviews with the band overlaid on archive footage that retells their first 20 years, directed by Brett Morgen who went on to make the acclaimed Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck. The Rolling Stones: Totally Stripped (1995) documents the making of their album Stripped, featuring acoustic versions of their own songs plus covers such as Bob Dylan’s Like a Rolling Stone, performed at more intimate venues than their usual stadium shows. The Rolling Stones are preparing for a European tour this summer, pressing on following the death of Watts in August 2021, with Steve Jordan now on the drummer’s stool. In the UK, they will play Liverpool’s Anfield Stadium on 9 June and two dates in London’s Hyde Park (25 June and 3 July). The band also intend to work with Jordan to complete their first album of new material since 2005’s A Bigger Bang, following the release of a single from the project, Living in a Ghost Town, in April 2020. “We do have a lot of stuff of Charlie Watts still in the can,” Richards said earlier this month. “We were halfway through making an album when he died … Of course, if we want to carry on recording, we’re gonna need drums, and it’s gonna be Steve Jordan.”",Arts/Music,BBC to mark the Rolling Stones’ 60th anniversary with new documentaries,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/31/bbc-to-mark-the-rolling-stones-60th-anniversary-with-new-documentaries
3/31/2022,"Close ties between Russian and Chinese state media along with strict government control of information have allowed Russian propaganda to spread swiftly throughout China, “nazifying” Ukraine in the eyes of some Chinese citizens and fostering pro-Russian sentiment, a new report has claimed. Taiwan-based cyber monitoring group, Doublethink Labs, tracked state and social media from mid-February until late March. It said Chinese sources were amplifying Russian disinformation about Ukraine and linking Ukrainian nazism to the Hong Kong protests to encourage solidarity between Russian and Chinese people against “foreign forces interfering with internal affairs”. Russian authorities had pushed a narrative of nazism in Ukraine as a key justification for its invasion of the country, as well as the threat posed by a Nato expansion – narratives that gained traction in China where anti-US sentiment runs high. China has claimed a neutral stance on the war, but has refused to label Russia’s act as an “invasion”. Just weeks before the invasion, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin signed a limitless partnership. Analysts say the war has left China in a difficult position, between supporting its key ally Russia, and avoiding the punitive sanctions being imposed by other nations. Instead, it has cast events as a conflict created and driven by the US and Nato, and presented itself as a potential mediator. The Doublethink Labs report pointed to content sharing agreements between the two countries’ state media, decisions by Chinese censors, influential social media accounts and government directives regarding coverage, as all contributed to driving public support for Russia’s attack, despite the Chinese government’s nominal stance of neutrality. Prior to the invasion, there was little discussion of Russia’s claimed need to “denazify Ukraine” until hostilities broke out, the report said. But the speed with which disinformation spread revealed, “the ease with which Sino-Russian state media cooperation can sow disinformation by citing each other as sources and expanding on each other’s angles”. “The tendency is clear: one side creates and the other expands, distorting information in a way that is beneficial to both countries.” Disinformation was found across domestic Chinese media, Chinese-language Russian media, and Chinese language accounts in western social media platforms that targeted the broader Chinese diaspora and people in Taiwan. In late February, as Russian troops were sent into Donetsk and Luhansk, Chinese media was issued a directive to only use official news released from People’s Daily, Xinhua news agency, and China Central Television – state-run mouthpieces which have had content-sharing agreements with Russian state media since as far back as 2015. Two days later, Russia invaded Ukraine, and China’s media pushed out false stories including Russian claims of Ukrainian soldiers surrendering, and their president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, fleeing. Other articles promoted fake polls claiming low support among Ukrainians for joining Nato, according to research by the Brookings Institute. Three days into the war, Weibo accounts and state-linked blogs resurfaced debunked reports from 2019 that had used a photo of a Ukrainian veteran at Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests as proof the US was funding members of the far-right Azov Battalion to attend the rallies and sow discord. In Taiwan, pro-Beijing social media also latched on to fake Russian news reports in early March of Ukrainian neo-Nazis shooting Chinese citizens and torturing Russian soldiers. The spread was also influenced by the decisions of censors which blocked Ukraine related content including posts by a Chinese citizen describing the invasion from inside Odesa, and senior voices urging for China to cut ties with Russia. But blocks on the term “Nazi” appeared to have been lifted during the crisis, allowing stories that justified Putin’s actions could appear and be shared on Chinese platforms. Charlie Smith, co-founder of Greatfire.org, a censorship monitoring site, said “Nazi” had long been identified as a keyword on most censorship lists for Chinese internet companies. “Usually once a word ends up on that list, it very rarely comes off,” he said. “Sometimes what is not being censored can be more telling than what is being censored.” Chinese authorities have denied spreading disinformation, and foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the accusation was itself an act of disinformation. But it has also amplified conspiracy theories about claims of US-funded bioweapon labs in Ukraine, which last week expanded to involve claims about Hunter Biden, George Soros, the US centres for disease control, and Covid-19. David Bandurski, analyst and editor of the China Media Project, said China’s state media had been amplifying Russian sources “back to 2021”, framing Russia’s actions as primarily defensive by running Russian reports suggesting Nato was building a presence along the border. “But pull back from the focus on events in Ukraine and you see that China has also played an active role in manufacturing disinformation to support the basic frames it has amplified about the conflict,” he said, citing as example the bioweapons labs claims. “The point here is to undermine US credibility over the longer term, and to push for a remaking of the international system. In this endeavour, Russia has been China’s most intimate partner,” said Bandurski.

3/31/2022,"How to show stereotypes of black masculinity without stereotyping black men? The issue comes up very early in Ivan Michael Blackstock’s Traplord, a dance, music, spoken word and video event that winds around themes of race, men and mental health. We’re in an industrial basement throbbing with low sound, the darkness pierced by searchlights that pick out figures sporting hoodies, puffer jackets and odd bits of bling. They flit from militaristic squadron to combative tussle, occasionally shooting fingers like pistols. It’s menacing, highly effective and awash with cliche. Crucially, though, we know it’s a mask – not only because it later becomes clear that some of the dancers are women, but more immediately because everyone is in blackface. Black skin, black masks: this volatile conjunction is freighted with significance and dramatic possibility. Indeed the whole show is shot through with a sense of double vision. Back-projections show video game graphics, their animated, role-played characters forming counterparts to those on stage. As one performer krumps before a mirror, her image comes to look less like a reflection than a sparring partner. A floppy ragdoll dummy is substituted by dancer Kanah Flex, the contortions of his impossibly loose limbs expressive of more interior, psychological torsions. It’s a very dense work, strewn with imagery – a Lord of the Flies-style pig mask, clouds of white powder, a song that echoes but does not imitate Billie Holiday’s Strange Fruit – and sometimes it becomes a bit too much (what’s all the patter about “the perfect human”?). But it is always broodingly atmospheric and the deliberate imperfections of its stage world – lo-fi hums and distorted sounds, video glitches and image scratches – suggest a persistent emotional dissonance. Through all this threads a slender story of a man finding himself: Blackstock, appearing often as an outsider in a rabbit-eared hat, sloping off to the sidelines or making himself scarce. Yet as often in storytelling, the buildup feels better than the final payoff. It’s been a gripping, perilous journey, finely danced and effectively produced – until the very last scene, where inflated symbols (a sword of truth, white-winged angels) strain towards resolution.  At 180 Studios, London, until 16 April:",Arts/Stage,Traplord review – gripping journey through black masculinity,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/31/traplord-review-ivan-michael-blackstock-180-studios-london
3/31/2022,"My husband, Brian Seller, who has died aged 68 of cancer, was a chartered civil engineer who worked for London Underground for more than 30 years and by retirement had become one of its of principal engineers, working on a large number of projects, including the tube tunnel extension to Heathrow Terminal 4. He particularly enjoyed being involved with the graduate trainee scheme and mentoring young engineers towards chartership. Born in Kirkcaldy in Fife, Brian was the youngest son of Jane (nee Twiby), a homemaker, and her husband, John Seller, who was in the army. When his father’s work took the family to Coulsdon in Surrey, Brian attended Chipstead Valley school, where he met Christopher Murphy, who became his lifelong friend. The alliance between the two initially formed because their mothers insisted they should start secondary school wearing short trousers. Later, Brian went to Redhill Technical College and then completed a degree in civil engineering at Hatfield Polytechnic, where he and I met. We became partners in 1976 and married in 1979, settling in East Dulwich in south-east London. Brian bought his first bike there, and began many years of cycling as a commuter, for leisure and on holiday. After a decade living in London we moved to Forest Row, East Sussex. Despite his long daily commute to London, Brian found time to help with school football, junior golf and to star as Father Christmas at the primary school Christmas fair. On his retirement we moved to the village of Firle, near Lewes. Brian adapted to his new way of life with ease while I was still working, enjoying weekly pilates classes in Firle, where he made lots of friends, and becoming a member of the Lewes U3A social cycling group. He also volunteered for the cycling charity Sustrans, becoming their south-east volunteer of the year in 2016, and his involvement in the Bike It project for schoolchildren resulted in him being known locally as “Bike It Brian”. He also promoted cycling among adults by helping out with the East Sussex Active Steps programme. Brian always voted for Labour or the Green party; he read the Guardian daily and listened to Radio 4 until Sailing By lulled him to sleep. The breadth of his knowledge was at times irksome, especially because by his own admission he rarely read books. He was a good listener and observer of people and the natural world, and had a gentle, dry humour. Among friends and family he was a renowned cook, and there was always a waiting list for Brian’s Brilliant Marmalade, which was often lightly flavoured with chilli that he had grown in the greenhouse. He is survived by me, our sons, Paddy and Jonny, and grandson, Barney.",News/UK news,Brian Seller obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/31/brian-seller-obituary
