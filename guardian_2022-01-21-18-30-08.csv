1/21/2022,"Poor Janet McTeer. Not since the Pacific breeze blew Steve Buscemi’s ashes into the Dude’s beard in The Big Lebowski have a character’s remains been so disrespectfully treated. At the start of the fourth series of Ozark (Netflix), Wendy and Marty Byrde, like a pair of Lady Macbeths, are washing the remains of cartel lawyer Helen Pierce (McTeer) out of their clothes in the bathroom of Mexican drug lord Omar Navarro’s palatial compound. At the end of series three, Navarro’s hitman offed Helen, because she was working an angle contrary to the cartel’s interest (trying to take over the Byrdes’ money-laundering casinos). “They blow her brains out two feet from us,” Wendy tells her children later. “We had to wash pieces out of our hair.”  The long-awaited, Covid-delayed final season – with one tranche of eight episodes being dropped now and the final six to come later this year – rejoins Wendy and Marty on the journey they started three series ago. They left Chicago for a resort in the Ozarks, laundering money through a bar and strip club to fund the nonprofit Byrde Family Foundation into which they could funnel heroin money to do good things, such as bankroll rehab centres for addicts. Instead of going straight, though, they sunk ever deeper into evil. By the end of series three, they were laundering drug money for the Navarro cartel through multiple casinos, partnering with the Kansas City mob to deal heroin, and luring the US army to raid and eliminate a rival cartel. Wendy kills her own brother to prove her loyalty to Navarro, helps his thuggish brother Javi dispose of the local sheriff who asks too many questions, and now plans to offer up her traitorous son Jonah to the FBI. Say what you like about Lady Macbeth: at least she didn’t have siblings to swell the body count nor sons to betray to the feds. Laura Linney’s performance as Wendy is all the more chilling because her face says apple pie, but everything she does curdles into evil. Meanwhile, Jason Bateman’s Marty is a study in how far a pragmatic accountant can go into the depths of wickedness without the strain showing on his face. If one of the great pleasures of Ozark is that strong women motor the storyline – not just Wendy, but hillbilly heroin farmer Darlene Snell and trailer-trash business whizz Ruth Langmore, not to mention daughter Charlotte Byrde, who dreams of whisking herself and brother Jonah to the Pacific north-west beyond their parents’ and the mob’s clutches – none of them is a role model. Even Ruth, who is Ozark’s token moral conscience, her every compunction subtly registered in Julia Garner’s impressive performance, is like everyone else: pursuing Ozark’s version of the degraded American dream – profiting from evil without consequence, then blowing town with a bank account swollen by drug money. Once the Byrdes have washed McTeer out of their hair, they go to Navarro’s gaudy party (the crab alone cost $10,000), where Omar tells them he too dreams of going straight, without having to do jail time or be assassinated by his upstart nephew Javi. “I’m sorry,” says Wendy. “That’s impossible.” “Isn’t this exactly what you were doing with your foundation?” Omar asks reasonably. “You can transform yourselves into a pillar of society, but you won’t do the same for me.” “I’m sorry. It’s not doable.” The temperature drops several degrees. “OK, why are you still alive?” The scene is set for the final season: the Byrdes must help one of the world’s most wanted drug kingpins to walk free or they will go the way of McTeer. The series premiere, The Beginning of the End, actually opens with one of those tantalising foreshadowing scenes that Ozark does so well. The Byrde family are driving to the soundtrack of Sam Cooke’s A Change Is Gonna Come – as if their troubles are behind them. It recalls the last scene of The Sopranos, in which the mob family are dining at Artie Bucco’s restaurant. We await some terrible denouement – machine gun splattering, ziti stuffed with explosives – but it never arrives. There was, rather, the realised possibility that against the odds, crime, indeed, can pay. Ozark ironically inverts that Sopranos ending. A juggernaut barrels down the wrong lane of the Missouri black top towards the Byrdes, forcing Marty to swerve and crash. Was it an accident? Was Navarro’s hitman at the wheel of the oncoming truck? Do the Byrdes survive to do what the Macbeths failed to – escape their bloody pasts? Nothing seems more unlikely, but I’ve been wrong before.",Arts/Television & radio,Ozark review – Jason Bateman and Laura Linney could teach Lady Macbeth a thing or two,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/21/ozark-review-jason-bateman-and-laura-linney-could-teach-lady-macbeth-a-thing-or-two
1/21/2022," The second of two collaborations between actor Kristen Stewart and director Olivier Assayas is this cunningly ambiguous ghost story cum stalker thriller from 2016. Stewart is a tightly wound presence as Maureen, an American in Paris with a job procuring haute couture clothes for a demanding female celebrity. She is also a medium whose twin brother has died – their pact that they would stay in touch beyond the grave leads to several chillingly depicted attempts to make contact. A series of creepy, anonymous text messages adds to her worries as she faces her fears and her grief, the camera circling her like an unseen spirit.Sunday 23 December, 1.25am, BBC Two Harry Macqueen’s chamber piece has a more muted take on memory loss than recent films The Father or Relic, but is no less heart-tugging. Longstanding couple Sam (Colin Firth) and Tusker (Stanley Tucci), who has early onset dementia, take a road trip to the Lake District. Amid family gatherings and cosy nights in their campervan, the pair struggle to deal with loss – in more ways than one. It may sidestep some of the realities of the condition, but this is a superbly acted drama about living life on your own terms.Saturday 22 December, 10.25am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere David Bowie’s otherworldly musical personas and mannered acting style made him an ideal lead for this seminal 1976 sci-fi. His alien, Thomas Jerome Newton, comes to Earth in disguise with a plan to save his dying planet. But in Nicolas Roeg’s fractured tale, he finds powerful interests – and his own weaknesses – conspiring against him. A woozy melancholy infuses the film, in the lives of the people Newton touches, his addictions to booze and television, and even in his love for Candy Clark’s waitress Mary-Lou.Sunday 23 December, 1.05am, Talking Pictures TV With part two just out in cinemas, here’s an opportunity to catch the challenging first tranche of Joanna Hogg’s semi-autobiographical coming-of-age drama. Honor Swinton Byrne plays Julie, a 24-year-old film student whose privileged upbringing has left her all at sea in terms of her creative voice and the authenticity of her work. Then she meets Foreign Office official Tony (an effortlessly toffish Tom Burke) and is seduced by his air of confidence and louche mystery. But his gaslighting of her and slowly revealed dark secrets begin to sour their relationship.Sunday 23 December, 10pm, BBC Two This is Roald Dahl, certainly, but as filtered through the lens of Wes Anderson it’s a curious beast. In a children’s animated adventure about an egotistical fox (voiced by George Clooney) and his long-running battle with three human farmers we find Anderson’s typically smart dialogue and passive-aggressive characters. There’s enough quick comedy, colourful spectacle and Dahlian viciousness for the kids, but this is really one for the grownups in the room.Sunday 23 December, 2pm, Channel 4 An unsettling Invasion of the Body Snatchers-style horror built in bold blocks of colour, Jessica Hausner’s 2019 film is set at a laboratory that is developing a mood-enhancing plant. When scientist Alice (Emily Beecham) brings one of the pretty red flowers home for her son, Joe (Kit Connor), and names it Little Joe, bad things are bound to happen. There’s good support from Ben Whishaw and Kerry Fox playing Alice’s concerned colleagues, as both mother and child find their behaviours changing in response to the possibly malevolent flora.Wednesday 26 December, 11.15pm, BBC Two Vincent Price’s 100th film is a fine example of the grand guignol tendency in 70s British horror. Director Robert Fuest had directed episodes of The Avengers, and this 1920s-set chiller has elements of the spy series’ line in stagey murders. Price’s mute, scarred widower takes revenge on the doctors he blames for his wife’s death by recreating the curses visited on Egypt in the Old Testament. It’s inventive stuff – kudos to the set and costume designers – even with a sadly diminished Joseph Cotten as one of the surgeons under threat.Friday 28 December, 9.05pm, Talking Pictures TV",Arts/Television & radio,Personal Shopper to The Souvenir: the seven best films to watch on TV this week,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/21/personal-shopper-to-the-souvenir-the-seven-best-films-to-watch-on-tv-this-week
1/21/2022,"The enforced confinement of 2020 spurred Julie Sassoon to dust off and release an inspired but long-shelved solo improv recording, If You Can’t Go Outside… Go Inside. Later that year, in a gap between lockdowns, she and her long-running quartet made this buzzing and conversational set. In those starkly contrasting projects, the Manchester-born Berlin-based pianist/composer seemed to be mirroring the period’s swerves between isolation and dreams of shared life. Sassoon is a fascinating original, her piano world inhabited by Keith Jarrett’s lyricism and driving hooks and Steve Reich’s minimalism, but perhaps most significantly, the resources she has been accumulating through collaborations with unorthodox jazz and contemporary classical improvisers since the 1990s.  The quartet – with saxophonist Lothar Ohlmeier, her long-time musical and life partner, and the powerful bass/drums pairing of Meinrad Kneer and Rudi Fischerlehner – toured Europe in February 2020, then went on to record these headlong yet lucidly eloquent originals in a Cologne studio that November. The bumpy, darting Missed Calls joins Ohlmeier’s squalling Albert Ayleresque tenor sax clamours to oompah-rhythm chug and dead halts. It sometimes recalls the sardonic vaudevillian mashups of the Netherlands’ Instant Composers Pool or Willem Breuker’s Kollektief, albeit subtly juxtaposed with Sassoon’s keyboard ruminations, her mandolin-like trills and soft chording. Dissonantly rapturous bowed-bass passages turn to bleary low-lights smooches and then to free-sax blusters: Waltz With Me starts in a warmly open triplet sway but becomes a duck-and-dive group improv chatter; the meditative, tiptoeing tone-poem Jerusalem is an abstractly beautiful showcase for all the band in turn, and the closing Melody opens as an exhilarating, fast-tempo free blast before evolving into hauntingly tremulous tenderness. This is music that splices lyrical shapeliness with bursts of take-no-prisoners abstraction, but Sassoon’s sensitivity to that balance is as alert here as her listeners have come to expect. The immense promise of the 24-year-old American saxophonist Immanuel Wilkins surges on with The 7th Hand (Blue Note) – on which Wilkins and his hip young New York lineup nimbly join heavyweight spiritual themes to light-footed contemporary jazz-making. On Louise (ACT), effervescent French saxophonist Emile Parisien steers a classy US-European sextet through his poetically pensive or driving, boppish originals, plus a fine account of Joe Zawinul’s Madagascar. And saxist/composer Mark Lockheart turns his cross-genre melodic nous to a dozen synth-textured, fitfully chilled-out themes with a quartet including keys original Elliot Galvin on Dreamers (Edition). A bit hook-and-vamp-bound for the improv-inclined, but it grows on you.",Arts/Music,Julie Sassoon Quartet: Voyages review | John Fordham's jazz album of the month,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/21/julie-sassoon-quartet-voyages-album-review

1/21/2022,"Currently larging it up at the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast, for whom he scored on Thursday as they guaranteed qualification for the knockout stages, eliminating reigning champions Algeria in the process, Franck Kessié could be on his way to the Premier League. Tottenham Hotspur are ready to make Milan a decent offer for the 25-year-old midfielder before the January window closes, in the hope of avoiding an unseemly bidding war for his services with Manchester United, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain when his contract expires in the summer.  Spurs see Kessie as the ideal replacement for Tanguy Ndombele, who looks increasingly likely to go on loan to PSG, in a deal which could include an option for the runaway Ligue 1 leaders to buy at the end of the season. Newcastle United remain interested in bringing Jesse Lingard on loan to St James’ Park until the end of the season and have made a new and improved offer after having a previous one rejected. Lingard is reported to be interested in the move but Manchester United want to cash in with a permanent deal for the 29-year-old, who will be a free agent in June. Newcastle are also reported to have submitted a £14.5m for Bayer Leverkusen’s Dutch left-back Mitchel Bakker and are inching closer to completing their £30m deal for Sevilla central defender Diego Carlos, despite facing competition from another unnamed Premier League club. With Bernd Leno also rumoured to be off to Tyneside, Arsenal will try to sign New England Revolution’s Matt Turner as a replacement for their reserve goalkeeper. After returning home early from Afcon following the detection of heart lesions after testing positive for Covid, Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang has taken to Instagram to provide fans with a medical update. “Hi guys, I came back to London to do some additional checks, and I’m very happy to say that my heart is absolutely fine and I’m completely healthy!!” he or one of his people wrote in a message accompanied by a beaming Pierre giving a thumbs-up in the gym. “Really appreciate all the messages over the last few days and I’m already back at it.” The news will be welcomed by Milan, Juventus, PSG, Marseille and Sevilla, who are all interested in taking the out-of-favour Gabon international on loan. Bordeaux and Nigeria winger Samuel Kalu is wanted by Watford, according to manager Claudio Ranieri. “It is not closed 100% and for this reason I said if the club think he is good for us, for now, for the future, we are ready to train with him,” he said. With three players signed already this month, Watford are also ramping up their efforts to get Liverpool defender Nat Phillips in the dressing-room door. And finally, Hull City winger Keane Lewis-Potter is a young man in big demand, with Brentford, Southampton, Leicester and West Ham all forming an orderly queue.

1/21/2022,"Two gay educators have spoken out about being sacked for their sexuality, warning an inquiry the religious discrimination bill will make it easier for such dismissals. Karen Pack said she was sacked “purely because I’m gay and I was getting married to my partner” while Nathan Zomprogno warned a Senate inquiry on Friday that schools “can and do” discriminate on sexuality.  LGBT equality groups have said the bill will override state laws with more limited religious exemptions to discrimination laws on hiring and firing and give schools stronger rights to sack teachers for their views on sexuality and marriage. Pack told the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee she was sacked as a lecturer at a Christian theological college after she became engaged to her same-sex partner in 2019. In March and April 2020 the college sacked Pack after it received complaints denouncing her relationship as “demonic”, despite praising Pack for her depth of Christian faith. “It was very clear that the problem wasn’t my teaching, my theology or my character,” she said. “It was purely because I’m gay and I was getting married to my partner, Bronte. “I have a sincerely held Christian faith. I am not trying to insinuate myself into anything. What is happening at the moment with this legislation and others is an attempt, essentially, to purge the church of people like myself.” Teacher Zamprogno told the hearing that Christian schools “can and do” sack teachers for their sexuality, and he and Pack were “just two examples of very many”. After working in private Christian schools for 20 years, Zamprogno said he was “well regarded and good at what I did” and believed his sexuality had “nothing to do with my ability to do my job”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “When I was challenged about my sexuality, I answered honestly and then I was told that there was no place for me at the school the following year,” he said. “The connection was crystal clear. “Employers will often obfuscate the reason that they’re letting their employee go, even when it is clear that it is because of their religious conviction or their sexuality,” he said. “The provisions of this bill effectively empower those who want to put pressure on and ultimately purge people of a different religious conviction to themselves, within religious communities.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app The attorney general’s department has submitted that although the bill does not affect schools’ ability to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation it “would allow a religious school to consider a person’s religious beliefs about issues such as sexuality” where it is part of the beliefs of the school. The Sydney Anglican church has defended an unnamed Christian school against the widely reported claims that teacher Stephanie Lentz had been sacked for being gay, by arguing she was sacked for her belief that a person can be a Christian and be gay. “A heterosexual teacher who held the same theological views on sexuality and relationships, and therefore was unable to sign the statement of belief, would also have had his or her employment terminated,” it said. Two parliamentary inquiries into the bill are due to report by 4 February. The bill is likely to require Labor support to pass, as three Liberal MPs are reserving their right to vote against it and a further group of four Liberals agreed to support it in return for greater protections for LGBTQ+ students that the attorney general appears to have reneged on. Michaelia Cash told a Christian webinar in December protections for LGBTQ+ students will have to wait for 12 months, despite Angie Bell, Fiona Martin, Dave Sharma and Katie Allen claiming they’d won support to pass them at the same time as the religious discrimination bill. Independent candidate for Wentworth Allegra Spender said “gay students should never be penalised or expelled from school for their sexuality”. “We mustn’t discriminate on the basis of religion but students and teachers must be protected in any laws,” she told Guardian Australia. “Once again the community is left guessing what the government is going to do. “The government needs to explain how it is going to protect vulnerable young people, rather than leaving us guessing.” Bell told Guardian Australia she will “continue to work with the attorney general and all stakeholders”. “I am certain there will be further discussion on amendments and possible solutions to ensure the safety and protection against discrimination for all Australians once the bill is reintroduced in parliament.”",News/Australia news,Teachers sacked for being gay warn religious discrimination bill will empower similar dismissals,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/21/teachers-sacked-for-being-gay-warn-religious-discrimination-bill-will-empower-similar-dismissals

1/21/2022,"Netflix’s market value plunged by almost a fifth after forecasting a dramatic slowdown in subscriber growth in the first quarter, as the pandemic-fuelled streaming boom fizzles out and competition from newer rivals such as Disney+ grows. Netflix expects to add only 2.5 million new subscribers globally in the first three months of the year, well down on the 4 million new sign-ups in the first quarter of 2021, and almost half the number expected by analysts.  Shares in the streaming company plunged by almost 20%, almost $45bn, as investors took fright at the unexpected slowdown in growth. “While retention and engagement remain healthy, acquisition growth has not yet re-accelerated to pre-Covid levels,” Netflix said, pointing to “Covid overhang and macroeconomic hardship” in parts of the world such as Latin America. Netflix added 8.3 million new subscribers in the final quarter of last year, thanks to hits such as the Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence film Don’t Look Up, and Squid Game, broadly in line with analyst expectations. Overall, Netflix added 18.2 million new subscribers last year, half the number it gained in 2020 when the pandemic fuelled a streaming boom as the public sought to alleviate boredom during lockdowns. Netflix admitted that the streaming wars against rivals such as Disney, Apple, HBO Max, Peacock and Amazon, which on Wednesday announced details of its mega-budget Lord of The Rings TV adaptation, is intensifying but that it remains in growth in all territories. “Consumers have always had many choices when it comes to their entertainment time – competition that has only intensified over the last 24 months as entertainment companies all around the world develop their own streaming offering,” the company said. “While this added competition may be affecting our marginal growth, we continue to grow in every country and region in which these new streaming alternatives have launched.” Last year, Netflix added the fewest number of UK subscribers since it launched in 2012.

1/21/2022,"Authorities and pet lovers in Hong Kong are locked in a game of cat and mouse, with citizens mounting a clandestine rescue operation for hamsters condemned to be euthanised over fears they could transmit Covid-19. On Tuesday, government and health officials announced traces of the virus had been found on 11 hamsters, all in a pet shop where a 23-year-old staff member had fallen ill. They decided more than 2,000 of the imported animals, including any pets bought since 22 December, must be killed, and “strongly recommended” owners surrender their pets.  For many, it was the final straw after two years of ad hoc and often illogical pandemic measures, and residents sprung into action, offering to hide or adopt the doomed pets. Tens of thousands signed petitions, while others offered to fake backdated receipts to before 22 December, the Washington Post reported. Groups gathered outside collection facilities urging people not to hand over their animals. One Causeway Bay woman, who gave the name Jessica, said she volunteered on a social media group to house a hamster, but was still waiting to be assigned one. “There are a lot​ of other volunteers,” she said. “I left a message saying which area I’m in, and that I could take one hamster because the flat I live in is small and I have a dog. “I can keep it forever, or if someone wants it back I can give it back,” she said, adding she wasn’t worried about the infection risk. “Even if I’d bought a hamster [myself], I would rather have Covid-19 than hand it in … Hong Kong makes such a big deal of it.” Local media was awash with footage and images of crying children saying goodbye to their hamsters, and interviews with people working to save them. Many spoke anonymously, their voices and faces disguised out of fear of retribution amid Hong Kong’s worsening security crackdown. A spokesperson for Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, called the backlash irrational, and said the animals had been “humanely dispatched … to minimise as soon as possible the potential risks of virus transmission”. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said attempts to save the hamsters obstructed the department’s work and posed a public health risk. “The AFCD demands them to stop such action immediately and return the hamsters taken away,” it said. “If the people concerned continue with such action, or fail to return the hamsters taken away, the AFCD will stringently follow up and hand it over to the police for handling.” Jessica said she was not worried about the government threats. “I don’t care about that, the police. Fuck them. They arrest people anyway for doing nothing,” she said.​ “Some of my friends are in jail now. Not because of a hamster. I would rather save a life. A hamster life is still a life and that’s what a lot of volunteers are thinking.” Animal welfare organisations have blasted the government’s decision, and urged people not to hand anything over, saying the government did not have the legal power to make the order. By Thursday, just 68 had been handed over by the public, according to government figures. Authorities have conceded there is no evidence that domestic animals can pass the disease to humans, but said they were acting out of caution. “We have reason to believe the source was the warehouse containing more than 1,000 hamsters in close proximity,” said Yuen Kwok-yung, a leading microbiologist and government adviser, on Wednesday. “The virus could multiply via cross-infection and spread to pet shops and other retail outlets.” Additional reporting by Xiaoqian Zhu",News/World news,Hongkongers launch hamster rescue mission after Covid cull declared,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/hongkongers-launch-hamster-rescue-mission-after-covid-cull-declared
1/21/2022,"OK, so the much ballyhooed Super Wild Card Weekend slate ended up being something of a bust. Of the six games, four ended up being blowouts, with only the Cincinnati Bengals’ win over the Las Vegas Raiders and the Dallas Cowboys’ epic choke-job against the San Francisco 49ers providing much drama. However, with the NFL playoff field culled down to eight, the divisional round traditionally ends up providing fans with the most exciting four games of the year. Here are our predictions for which teams will be advancing to the conference finals.  What the Bengals need to do to win: At the risk of repeating ourselves, the Bengals’ success lies in Joe Burrow keeping it up. If Burrow can have another performance like the one had against the Raiders last week, where he threw for two touchdowns (albeit one with an assist from an erroneous whistle) and amassed 244 yards, the Bengals could pull off something nearly unthinkable: a playoff winning streak. What the Titans need to do to win: Rely heavily on their running game. Tennessee quarterback Ryan Tannehill has had a fine year, but the passing game is not their true strength. Plus, the Bengals’ defense has allowed a not-ideal 4.4 yards per rush this season, making it a crucial weakness for the Titans’ running back corps to exploit. Key player: Derrick Henry, running back, Titans. While Henry has been out with a fractured foot since Week 8, the unstoppable running back is one of the best players in the league when healthy. The question is how good he will be. Tennessee has proven they can with without him, going 6-3 in his absence, but the playoffs are a different beast and the Titans are at their most dangerous when Henry is barreling through hapless defenses. Prediction: Bengals over Titans What the 49ers need to do to win: Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, who is dealing with a strained shoulder, simply cannot afford to make the mistakes that nearly doomed his team against the Cowboys. During the win, he threw one potentially game-changing pick in the fourth quarter and was inches away from throwing a second. The 49ers got away with their blunders last week because the Cowboys were even sloppier, but the Green Bay Packers won’t be as forgiving. What the Packers need to do to win: With Aaron Rodgers as their quarterback, the trick will be for the Green Bay defense to force the ailing Garoppolo into a throwing contest. The Packers should be able to score with ease – that’s not going to be the issue – but the 49ers are a great team, well-rounded team that could very well keep pace. That is unless, as noted above, they expose San Francisco’s weakness at the most important position in the entire sport. If fans are starting to call for 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan to insert rookie Trey Lance by halftime, this one will essentially be a wrap. Key player: Davante Adams, wide receiver, Green Bay Packers. Aaron Rodgers is going to be the league MVP for the second straight season, but let’s give some credit to his top receiver. Adams is a huge reason for Rodgers’ success, having put up 2,927 yards and scored 29 touchdowns combined over the past two seasons. If this weekend’s heavyweight matchup is Josh Allen v Patrick Mahomes, then Adams v Deebo Samuel will make one hell of an undercard. Prediction: Packers over 49ers What the Rams need to do to win: Get a big game from quarterback Matthew Stafford. The Buccaneers have a great scoring defense but not the best luck in limiting the pass. Opposing quarterbacks averaged a 65% completion rate against the Bucs. If Stafford can do his best to throw it to the players wearing Rams uniforms, not exactly his greatest attribute as a QB, he could put his team in line for a road victory. What the Buccaneers need to do to win: Keep Tom Brady upright. If the offensive line doesn’t do its job, the Rams could stifle the mighty Tampa Bay offense. As great as Brady is, he’s still 44 years old and was never the most mobile quarterback in the league. He’s also missing most of his reliable targets, not counting Rob Gronkowski, so he might need an extra second or two to get the ball out of his hands. Key player: Aaron Donald, defensive tackle, Rams. What Rodgers is to defense, Aaron Donald is to defense.
