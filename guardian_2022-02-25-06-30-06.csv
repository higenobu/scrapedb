2/25/2022,"Ron DeSantis, the right-wing Republican governor of Florida, has fueled speculation about a future US presidential run with a high profile speech lambasting Joe Biden, the media and what he termed “wokeism”. DeSantis, who is both an ally and possible rival to Donald Trump, delivered the attack at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the biggest annual gathering of grassroots conservatives in the US.  The governor was speaking in Orlando in his home state, but the broad and national sweep of his address, which did not mention Trump by name, was consistent with eyeing a potential White House run in 2024 or 2028. “I can tell you there’s one fellow that just hates Florida: his name is Joe Biden,” said DeSantis, setting himself up as the voice of opposition to the incumbent US president, whose name elicited boos in the cavernous ballroom. “Always trying to take pot shots at Florida and he does things like take our medication. He stiffs storm victims of relief just because he doesn’t like the governor. He doesn’t like Florida. He doesn’t like me because we stand up to him.” The crowd cheered and applauded DeSantis, 43, who went on to rail against Biden over border security, crime and the economy. “The inflation is because of his policies and we’re not going to let anyone forget that. So all told, he’s had the worst first year of any president since the 1800s. “And as Biden flounders, Florida is leading on issue after issue ... We are in the process of getting money from the legislature so that if Biden is dumping illegal aliens into Florida from the southern border, I’m rerouting them to Delaware. We’ll do some in DC and Hollywood as well.” The reference to Biden’s home state was a populist crowd pleaser – it produced a resounding roar of approval – that Trump himself would have envied. Indeed, DeSantis’s speech was a model of Fox News talking points that mocked “lockdown” politicians for holidaying in Florida, which he declared the least restrictive state in the nation during the coronavirus pandemic. In an attack on Biden’s chief medical adviser, infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci, DeSantis declared: “From the very beginning, we refused to let this state descend into some type of Faucian dystopia where people’s freedoms are curtailed and their livelihoods are destroyed ... Florida has defeated Faucism. Freedom has prevailed in the sunshine state.” He added: “I really believe had Florida not led the way, this country could look like Canada or Australia.” Florida is such a bastion of freedom, he claimed, that people are settling there as they flee from “leftist governments” in America and around the world. The slogan at this year’s CPAC, where Trump is due to speak on Saturday, is “Awake not woke”. DeSantis tapped into the resentments of the audience – some of whom wore “DeSantisLand” caps and flags – by launching a broadside at so-called “woke culture”. He boasted about banning critical race theory (CRT), an academic discipline that studies how racism is embedded in US law and institutions that, despite not taught in America’s public schools, has been caricatured and demonized by the right. “They want us to be powerless, they want us to be voiceless, they want us to be second-class citizens,” said DeSantis, who is running for reelection as governor this year, “And what are these ideological aims? The woke is the new religion of the left, and this is what they have in mind.” Many major institutions – including big tech companies – have become “infected with this woke virus”, the former Republican congressman added. “You look at the corrupt and dishonest legacy media in this country and what they’re doing to divide us and what they’re doing to prop up the regime”.",News/US news,Ron DeSantis fuels US presidential run speculation with CPAC speech,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/24/ron-desantis-cpac-speech-florida-joe-biden-media
2/25/2022,"Joe Biden on Thursday announced a fresh round of what he said would be crippling sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, declaring that Vladimir Putin “chose this war” and that he and his country will bear the consequences. The sanctions target Russia’s largest banks and companies, cutting them off from western financial markets, while imposing export controls and sanctioning Russian oligarchs and their families.  “Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war,” the US president said. “And now he and his country will bear the consequences.” Taken together, Biden said the measures taken by the US and allied nations around the world were meant to “maximize a long-term impact” on Russia, extracting severe costs on Moscow immediately and over time for what Biden called its “brutal assault” on a sovereign nation. Biden was emphatic in his vow that US troops would not engage Russia in Ukraine, but he again affirmed the US would defend “every inch of Nato territory”. The commitment was underscored by an announcement that Biden had authorized the deployment of additional troops to eastern Europe. Biden warned that Putin’s “quest for empire” extended beyond Ukraine, saying the Russian leader sought to re-create the former Soviet Union. As Biden addressed the nation from the East Room of the White House, the Ukrainian government reported mounting casualties as Russian forces attacked the nation from land, air and sea. Biden’s remarks came hours after he held a virtual meeting with the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Italy and Japan. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Council president Charles Michel, and Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg were also in attendance. Earlier on Thursday, he convened a meeting of the US national security council. The penalties come a day after the White House unveiled an initial “tranche” of sanctions in response to Putin’s recognition of two breakaway republics in east Ukraine. The sanctions announced on Thursday aim to further destabalize Russia’s financial system while starving the county of technology critical to its economy and military. The US Treasury said the latest round of sanctions against Russia would impact nearly 80% of all banking assets in the country, fundamentally threatening the Russian economy and weakening the Kremlin’s geopolitical posture. “Treasury is taking serious and unprecedented action to deliver swift and severe consequences to the Kremlin and significantly impair their ability to use the Russian economy and financial system to further their malign activity,” said Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary. Biden said the purpose of the sanctions was to limit “Russia’s ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen to be part of the global economy”. But they are not as forceful as some elected officials in the US and Ukraine have called for, steps that would include removing Russia from the Swift international banking system and targeting Russia’s energy sector or leveling sanctions against Putin personally. “We demand the disconnection of Russia from Swift, the introduction of a no-fly zone over Ukraine and other effective steps to stop the aggressor,” the Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a tweet. On Thursday, congressman Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, called on the US to “dramatically escalate” its response to Moscow and endorsed calls to remove Russia from the international banking system and its ability to access western capital. Biden argued that time was needed to the current round of sanctions to take their desired effect, and said the US was “prepared” to impose more severe penalties on Russia. The president defended his administration’s response. For several weeks, the US has declassified and made public Putin’s secret plans, while moving quickly to blame Russia for a series of cyber-attacks against Ukrainian banks and agencies. The purpose of the approach was to expose the Kremlin’s justification for war as baseless, he said. “Now, it’s unfolding largely as we predicted,” the president said. Biden also urged resolve among the American people, who he said would likely face economic consequences as a result of what Biden called Putin’s “naked aggression”. The US has also warned government agencies and operators of critical infrastructure to take pre-emptive actions to safeguard against a potential Russian cyber-attack. As he has warned throughout his presidency, he said democracies around the world were being tested and threatened by Putin’s “sinister vision for the future of our world”. He said there was never a question that the US would respond to Russia’s assault on Ukraine. “This aggression cannot go unanswered,” Biden said. “America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom. This is who we are.”",News/US news,Biden issues new sanctions for Russia: ‘America stands up to bullies’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/24/joe-biden-us-russia-sanctions-ukraine
2/25/2022,"Ukraine was fighting for its survival after Vladimir Putin unleashed a punishing offensive on the country that left hundreds dead or injured, and world leaders warning Moscow has embarked on a dangerous new era of imperial expansion. The continent awoke to the shock of scenes it had once believed it had left behind with the horrors of the twentieth century: helicopters strafing homes outside the capital, long lines of tanks ploughing ever deeper towards Ukraine’s heartland, roads choked with refugees, and civilians huddled in underground metro stations to escape bombardment.  The west scrambled to respond with a range of new sanctions against Moscow, with the US also announcing it would send 7,000 more troops to Germany to shore up Nato’s eastern borders. But even after the invasion there were divisions on the strength of the response, as Russian forces advanced undeterred by the threats. With ferocious fighting on multiple fronts, Putin’s ultimate war aims were not entirely clear, but they appeared to be ambitious. Russian airborne forces descended on a military base at Hostomel, just outside Kyiv, with the possible objective of forcing open a pathway to the capital. Russian troops were also clearly attempting to cut off Kharkiv in the east, Ukraine’s second city with a population of nearly 1.5 million. Ukrainian authorities said one Russian column had seized control of the Chernobyl nuclear plant, site of Europe’s worst environmental disaster in 1986, and an emblem for many Ukrainians of the incompetent despotism of rule from Moscow. Mykhailo Podoliak, an adviser to the head of the president’s office in Kyiv, admitted it was “impossible to say” whether the site, where the remains of its radioactive reactor core lie buried, was safe. The port city of Mariupol, which lies between the two regions of Ukraine already occupied by Russia, Crimea and the Donbas in the east, was also reported to be under heavy fire. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, declared martial law and pledged his government would arm every Ukrainian willing to defend their country. As Ukrainian diplomats pleaded with the world to stop the Russian aggression, Zelenskiy warned of a bleak return to the past. “What we have heard today are not just missile blasts, fighting and the rumble of aircraft,” he said. “This is the sound of a new iron curtain, which has come down and is closing Russia off from the civilised world. Our national task is to make sure this curtain does not fall across our land.” Many of Putin’s keenest observers had thought the Russian leader would hesitate before ordering an all-out land war to subjugate Ukraine because of the potentially catastrophic consequences for Russia as well as Ukraine, but he proved them wrong. While Russia was chairing an emergency session of the UN security council that was tasked with finding a way out of the crisis the Kremlin had engineered, Putin broadcast a declaration of war he had recorded three days earlier, underlining the futility of the global diplomatic efforts to dissuade him. The US and Europe sought to inflict punitive measures on his regime with the aim of ensuring Putin’s war of choice became his worst strategic blunder, by crippling the Russian economy. “Putin’s aggression against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearly economically and strategically,” Joe Biden warned. “We will make sure of that. Putin will be a pariah on the international stage.” Biden said he was sending 7,000 more troops to strengthen Nato’s eastern borders, expelling Russian diplomats, imposing sanctions on Russia’s two largest banks and almost 90 financial institution subsidiaries around the world. Asked if the invasion marked the start of a new cold war, Biden replied: “That depends.” “It’s going to be a cold day for Russia,” he said. At the same time, the UK announced its “largest ever” set of economic sanctions on Russia, freezing assets of all major Russian banks and limiting cash held by Russian nationals in UK banks and sanctioning more than 100 individuals and entities. However, there were clear divisions between the US and more cautious European allies who are concerned about the global economic ramifications of some of the stronger sanctions. Biden admitted for example that exclusion from the Swift global electronic transactions system was not in the present package of sanctions. It was not, Biden said, the “position that the rest of Europe wishes to take”. Nor did the sanctions announced on Thursday include restrictions on Putin himself. The omission of Swift sanctions enraged the Kyiv government. The foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said that those opposing the move had to “understand that the blood of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children will be on their hands too.” In announcing the sanctions on Thursday, Biden suggested that a wider conflict was possible, given Putin’s aspirations. “He has much larger ambitions than Ukraine. He wants to reestablish the former Soviet Union, that’s what this is about,” he said. In his speeches, Putin has portrayed the Ukrainian government as a mortal threat to Russia, and hinted heavily at his desire for regime change. He claimed that the Kyiv government had ambitions and means to acquire nuclear weapons, and was run by Nazis – claims so outlandish that they triggered questions about the Russian leader’s mental stability. By mid-afternoon on Thursday, Russia’s defence ministry claimed to have “neutralised” Ukraine’s airbases and air defences, destroying 74 military ground facilities, including 11 airfields, three command posts and 18 radar stations for anti-aircraft missile systems. Ukrainian authorities said Russia had carried out 203 attacks and that fighting was raging across almost the entire territory. Military sources in Ukraine said 20 Russian helicopters and Mi-8 aircraft had landed paratroopers at Hostomel airport in the Kyiv region, where forces from both sides were fighting for control. They said Ukrainian forces had killed 50 Russian troops, destroyed four Russian tanks, and downed six Russian planes and four helicopters. Zelenskiy also said Ukrainian forces were fighting to prevent Russian troops capturing the former nuclear power plant at Chernobyl. The early hours of the invasion appeared to have claimed dozens of civilian lives in Ukraine. According to the authorities, 18 people were killed in a missile attack in the southern Odessa region, six people were killed in the town of Brovary, near Kyiv, and four people were killed, and 10 injured, after an “occupier’s shell” hit a hospital in the city of Vuhledar in Donetsk. Air raid sirens sounded in Ukraine’s major cities, and civilians in Kyiv and Kharkiv sheltered in the cities’s metro stations – scenes that haven’t been seen in those cities since 1941. Kuleba urged the world to wake up. “Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine,” he said “Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes. This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.”",News/World news,Ukraine fights for its survival as Putin presses forward,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/ukraine-fights-for-its-survival-as-putin-presses-forward
2/25/2022,"It was in early November that US president Joe Biden took the rare step to dispatch CIA director Bill Burns to Moscow. The spy chief’s message – in part – was to warn his Kremlin counterparts that the West was concerned about unusual troop movements it was seeing near Ukraine’s border.  British officials were anxious, too. “We keep on coming back to crises over Ukraine,” one said later that month. “President Biden does not send Bill Burns to Moscow unless he is very worried about something. And so, you know, without being able to go into the full details, there is enough substance to this to make us concerned.” A few days later, in early December, the Washington Post reported that US intelligence had found that the Kremlin was “planning a multi-front offensive as soon as early next year involving up to 175,000 troops”, from the north, east and south. The intelligence warnings continued into January, increasingly to the irritation of Kyiv, whose president Volodymyr Zelenskiy complained that acute tensions with Russia were nothing new. “We have been in the situation for eight years,” he said at the time, referring to the start of the 2014 war with Russian-backed separatists. At the time, some were considered outlandish. Britain warned that Russia was contemplating a coup plot, involving four exiled politicians, while the US said plans were afoot to create a pretext for an invasion using a “very graphic” fake video of a Ukrainian attack. It turned out that Russia did try to create false pretexts, but with none of the production values – or credibility – the US warning implied. The debacle of the buildup to the war in Iraq, where claims of weapons of mass destruction turned out to be baseless, has hung over US and UK agencies for two decades.
