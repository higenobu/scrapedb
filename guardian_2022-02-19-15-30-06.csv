2/19/2022,"For Black employees at Tesla’s flagship California plant, coming into work could mean being harassed, bullied by a supervisor or finding racist graffiti sprayed on factory walls. That’s according to a new lawsuit filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), which alleges that Black workers in the company’s Fremont factory experienced “rampant racism” that the company left “unchecked for years”.  In the suit, filed on 9 February in an Alameda county court in California, the agency says Black workers reported they were subjected to racist slurs and drawings and were assigned the most physically demanding jobs. “Workers referred to the factory as the ‘slaveship’ or ‘the plantation’, where defendants’ production leads ‘crack the whip’,” the agency said in the complaint. “Tesla has continued to deflect and evade responsibility,” the lawsuit adds. “While it claims to not tolerate racial harassment or discrimination at its factories, Tesla’s investigations of complaints are not compliant with law.” Allegations of racial discrimination at Tesla’s US facilities aren’t new. The company has been hit with several discrimination lawsuits from employees over similar allegations in recent years. But filed by a government agency, the new suit may have far wider implications. “When a single worker sues Tesla, the company may be motivated to sweep the allegations under the rug. But here, the potential for actual, systemic change is much greater,” said Veena Dubal, labor law professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. Tesla has called the lawsuit “misguided” in a public blog post, noting that it focuses on alleged misconduct that took place between 2015 and 2019, but that in more recent years the DFEH has dismissed dozens of individual discrimination complaints against the company. The company said it does not tolerate harassment and has disciplined and fired workers who engaged in misconduct. “A narrative spun by the DFEH and a handful of plaintiff firms to generate publicity is not factual proof,” Tesla said. The company, which has disbanded its media relations department, did not respond to additional requests for comment. The case is just the latest spat between the carmaker and US regulators. “At a time when manufacturing jobs are leaving California, the DFEH has decided to sue Tesla instead of constructively working with us,” the company said in its blogpost. Earlier this week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk accused federal regulators of unfairly targeting Tesla, saying in a recent filing that the Securities and Exchange Commission has engaged in “outsized efforts” to monitor the company that “seem calculated to chill its exercise” of free speech. The claims center around allegations in Tesla’s Fremont factory in the San Francisco Bay area. Black workers at the facility were subjected to “offensive racial harassing conduct so severe and pervasive that it created a hostile work environment”, according to the 39-page complaint from DFEH. Many workers reported derogatory comments came directly from their superiors, the agency writes. One Black worker reported hearing racial slurs as often as 50-100 times a day, being called the “N-word”, and “hood rats”, according to the complaint. Others workers told of racist graffiti found in factory common areas, including swastikas, KKK, the N-word, and other racist writing that Tesla did not remove for months at a time, according to the suit. Black workers reported being assigned difficult, menial jobs in segregated areas of the factory known as “the dark side”, DFEH also says, and are less likely to be promoted to management positions. “For many Black workers, the stress from the severe and pervasive racial harassment, the risk of a physical altercation and escalation with harassers, the blatant discrimination, the disproportionately severe discipline, and the futility of complaining, made the working conditions so intolerable that they resigned,” the complaint says. The complaint also alleges Tesla has been ignoring “years of complaints from Black workers.” “These numerous complaints by Black and/or African American workers about racial harassment, racial discrimination, and retaliation lodged over a span of almost a decade have been futile,” the lawsuit reads. A diversity report published by Tesla in December 2020 showed employees identifying as Black and African American make up 10% of its US workforce, but only 4% of employees at director level. Employees who identified as Hispanic and Latino employees make up 22% of the total workforce, but represent only 4% of employees at the director level and above. According to the DFEH complaint, Tesla’s human resources department is “understaffed and inadequately trained”, leading to a failure to address complaints by workers. In 2020, the company had one HR professional for every 740 employees, DFEH said. “One Black worker stated that immediately after she complained about race harassment, [Tesla] human resources official texted her harasser, who was also her supervisor, about her complaint against him,” the complaint says. Last week’s filing is just the latest in a number of discrimination lawsuits to hit what has become the world’s most valuable automaker. A federal jury in October awarded $137m to Owen Diaz, an employee at the Fremont plant in 2015 and 2016 who said managers ignored his complaints about repeated racial harassment including slurs and swastikas scrawled on bathroom walls. A judge in that case is considering Tesla’s bid for a new trial or to lower the award, which is one of the largest in a discrimination lawsuit by a single worker. In December, six female plaintiffs working in plants across the US alleged that they experienced physical assaults, harassment, and catcalling at Tesla facilities. Another female employee made similar claims in a lawsuit filed in November. “The through line for all of these lawsuits is the systemic nature of the harassment and discrimination in Tesla’s workplace,” said attorney David A Lowe, a partner at the firm representing the women. “The extent of the complaints show that it is a widespread, egregious problem – it’s clearly not just a couple of bad apples.” The company is also still fighting a lawsuit filed in 2017 by Marcus Vaughn, yet another employee at the same Fremont factory who alleged he was repeatedly called the “N-word” by managers and co-workers. Vaughn also claims he was fired for “not having a positive attitude” when he brought complaints about the treatment to HR. A judge in 2018 rejected Tesla’s bid to force Vaughn’s case into arbitration. Tesla has also moved to force the recent sexual harassment case into arbitration, a motion that will be ruled on in coming weeks. Tesla has denied wrongdoing in all cases, and has said it has implemented various policies in recent years to prevent racist conduct and punish it when it does occur. “Our company has more than 33,000 employees, with over 10,000 in the Fremont factory alone, so it is not humanly possible to stop all bad conduct, but we will do our best to make it as close to zero as possible,” Tesla said regarding the case filed by Vaughn. While DFEH’s suit may not be the first discrimination suit filed against Tesla, it may be the most consequential, said Dubal, the labor law professor. That’s because the agency is not bound by agreements most Tesla employees have signed to bring legal claims in arbitration rather than court. “While an individual suing may be sent to arbitration, the state will not be. This means that this lawsuit can change the alleged pattern and practice of discrimination,” said Dubal. The department can also seek the same kind of relief as workers who file lawsuits, including court orders barring future discrimination and money damages. Such penalties can be significant: in December, gaming company Riot Games agreed to pay $100m to settle a sex discrimination lawsuit by the agency. Tesla is accused of violating the Fair Employment and Housing Act and the California Equal Pay Act, and could face fines of millions of dollars in addition to enforced changes to internal policies. The company may also be required to provide back pay to employees who say they were unfairly compensated for their work due to discrimination. The odds do not look good for Tesla, said Dubal. State agencies have “limited resources” and typically only take on cases where “there is very clear evidence” of wrongdoing and they are “very likely to win”, she said. “There are many issues with racial discrimination in Silicon Valley – from executive suites to the factory workers,” she said. “This shows state enforcement agencies are listening to what people are experiencing and going after these companies.” Reuters contributed to this report.",News/Technology,Black workers accused Tesla of racism for years.

2/19/2022,"As Britain emerges from the Omicron wave, ministers are thrashing out a “living safely with Covid” plan for England expected to be announced next week. The strategy should see freedoms expanded back towards pre-pandemic norms in an attempt to readjust people’s attitudes towards coronavirus. The decisions taken this weekend in Whitehall will have major repercussions for public health across the country. While vaccines have drastically blunted Covid hospitalisations and deaths, and restrictions came with significant downsides, lifting further measures is unlikely to come without a cost – particularly for those in vulnerable groups.  Here we take a look at what could change, and the potential implications: Free home-delivered lateral flow tests (LFTs) for all are likely to be scrapped, possibly within weeks. Ministers are divided over when the tests, designed for people who do not have Covid symptoms, should be wound down – with “hawks” pushing for a reigning in of billions of pounds in public spending while “doves” believe mass surveillance of the virus should continue. Discussions are also under way about when over the next month advice should be rescinded for people in schools and universities to get tested twice a week. Those with Covid symptoms may be moved off PCR tests, which are also likely to cease being free at some point in March, and on to LFTs. About 1.3 million of the country’s most vulnerable people will probably continue to get free access to tests. Some scientists have raised concerns at the proposals, pointing out that reducing PCR testing may compromise the UK’s capacity to spot and monitor new variants. They also worry about the availability of LFTs being reduced because of their importance for detecting Covid outbreaks and letting people manage the risk of spreading the virus to vulnerable contacts. “If testing is not free, people won’t do it,” said Dr Julian Tang, a clinical virologist at the University of Leicester, adding that would mean relying on hospital tests and so-called “sentinel testing networks” to track the virus, as is the case for flu. Tang said he believed the virus is likely to evolve to become milder, but added: “On the way, there may be the occasional more virulent variant that causes more hospitalisation briefly before dying out – as we have seen with Beta, Gamma, Lambda, Mu variants.” Johnson announced in his final Commons appearance before recess that the legal requirement for anyone with Covid to isolate was expected to end a month earlier than the planned date of 24 March. Contact tracing will also likely be scaled back, along with an end to “support payments” worth £500 for low-income workers who would struggle to afford missing work by isolating. According to a paper from behavioural scientists advising the government, withdrawing testing and making isolation voluntary might give some the message it is acceptable to socialise with others despite being infected or having symptoms. The scientists warned that removing restrictions would disproportionately impact vulnerable sections of the population such as those in precarious employment. While Downing Street has stressed “we would never recommend anyone goes to work when they have an infectious disease”, this may not have much effect: that advice is often unheeded. Prof Susan Michie, director of the UCL Centre for Behaviour Change and part of the writing group for the paper, said: “We need to change our whole culture to be more oriented to health and safety, with presenteeism at work disapproved of and people told by employers to stay at home if unwell or likely to be infectious.” Though a surge in cases may not be as alarming as it once was, experts warn that the high prevalence of Covid means an uptick could see hospitalisations quickly reach levels seen over the festive period, putting more pressure on the NHS when waiting lists are already at a record high. Driving up the level of jabs administered to help increase the population’s immunity will remain a key priority for the government. So far, around a third of people over the age of 12 have still not had a Covid booster. According to the UK Health Security Agency, protection against death in over-50s was about 60% 25 weeks past the second vaccine dose, while two weeks after a booster dose it was about 95%. Two jabs offered 25-35% protection against hospitalisation after 25 weeks, compared with about 75% 10 to 14 weeks after a Pfizer booster. However the World Health Organization has warned that offering further boosters of the original Covid jabs is not a “viable strategy” against new variants. Instead, it has stressed the importance of developing vaccines that do a better job at preventing transmission, and which elicit a broad, long-lasting immune response. Experts are divided about the best route to take when it comes to vaccinations, not least because of a lack of data on the benefits of repeated mRNA boosters. Ministers are also understood to be keen to help make more use of antiviral treatments – currently available to about 1.3 million people – to help treat those who catch Covid and limit the risk of severe illness developing. While most of the toughest travel restrictions have already been scrapped, the currently empty “red list” will remain in reserve should ministers need to use it again to redirect all arrivals from a particular country into hotel quarantine. For now, unvaccinated people will continue to need to continue to take a Covid test before they travel to England and another within two days of arrival. The passenger locator form will remain mandatory, but be “simplified” and could be scrapped later in the year. Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at Southampton University, said the success of vaccines in reducing both symptomatic infection and onward transmission has been pivotal. Since plan B was scrapped in England a month ago, masks have returned to being optional rather than mandatory on most public transport and in shops. Some services, such as Transport for London, still require face coverings to be worn. Ministers are still discussing what should happen in healthcare settings like hospitals and care homes, the last remaining places where masks are mandatory. Michie said that for masks, as with other measures, removing legal requirements wrongly signalled that the risk was not great or that the measures were not effective enough. “The extent to which they will be retained will depend on the messaging from government and other institutions,” she said. The government ended shielding advice for people previously considered to be clinically extremely vulnerable in September 2021. Further specialist advice for those people, which included suggestions such as asking home visitors to wear face coverings and avoiding enclosed crowded space, also looks set to be withdrawn. Baroness Brinton, a Liberal Democrat peer who is clinically extremely vulnerable, said she was “utterly astonished” that the reported change had received little publicity. “It’s all part of the prime minister’s tactic of pretending the pandemic’s over, while making no mention of the millions of clinically vulnerable people who will suffer as a result,” she told the i.",News/World news,Living with Covid: what are risks of England’s plan to lift restrictions?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/living-with-covid-what-are-risks-england-plan-to-lift-restrictions
2/19/2022,"Sausage rolls instead of toilet rolls? Sponge scourers instead of Victoria sponge cake? These are some of the strangest substitutions shoppers have received in their online grocery orders, according to research from consumer group Which? that found two in five of those polled had received unusual replacement items in their supermarket delivery.  One bemused customer received cooking oil in place of milk, while another had hoped to dine on breaded fish fillets but ended up with a tub of Ben and Jerry’s Phish Food ice-cream. Other unexpected items in the bagging area included a box of eggs instead of Cadbury Creme Eggs, while another disappointed shopper had a good excuse not to clean the house after the Domestos cleaning product they had ordered was exchanged for orange squash. Strange substitutions often arise when supermarket pickers – people who select items for online orders – receive a computer-generated prompt on their handheld scanner if the customer has chosen a product that is not available. These suggestions are not always suitable, so the retail worker often has to manually override it, which can be time-consuming when they are trying to meet tight targets. “While product substitutions in your online shopping can sometimes be genuinely helpful, our research has shown that they can also be downright ridiculous,” said Ele Clark, retail editor at Which?. Customers can reject substitutions when their delivery arrives or opt out of receiving replacement items, Clark said. Some of the swaps may be amusing – who wants to do DIY with duck paste instead of duct tape? Or dine on dog food instead of breadsticks? But shoppers with dietary requirements or food intolerances said it was no laughing matter. Vegan and vegetarian customers said they sometimes received meat or dairy instead of plant-based alternatives, while one shopper with a gluten intolerance was not impressed when their gluten-free flour was exchanged for regular self-raising. The discount supermarket Aldi was the most likely to provide substitutions to customers placing click-and-collect orders, Which? found, with nearly half of shoppers (49%) receiving replacement products in their most recent shop. Customers from all of the UK’s largest supermarkets that offer online shopping – including Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Ocado – reported receiving substitutions in their most recent orders. Many product substitutions leave shoppers disappointed and forced to make last-minute changes to their dinner plans. Nevertheless, occasionally customers strike lucky.

2/19/2022,"It is 8am on a Friday and I am walking around Bury, Greater Manchester, looking for toothpaste. The immediate area is unpromising: an overpass in one direction, an underpass in the other, and no shops in sight. My phone dings in my pocket. It’s a text from my wife that reads, “In case you were feeling guilty”, and is accompanied by a photo of a brand-new hairbrush. Yes, I packed our only hairbrush, forcing her to buy another, and no, I don’t feel guilty. The previous day I had looked at my hair in the mirror and decided mine was the greater need. She’s lucky I didn’t take the toothpaste; it had certainly been my intention.  I find a chemist on an otherwise deserted corner, buy some toothpaste and stomp back to the hotel as an icy rain begins to fall. Several weeks of rehearsal have reminded me what it’s like to be in a band, but I’d forgotten what it’s like to be on tour. There are moments of apprehension and of adulation, but they are brief compared with everything else: the setting up and breaking down, the loading out and loading in, the waiting around, the endless getting ready. “Move back,” I say, in the dressing room half an hour before showtime. “I need to set this up.” The accordion player looks at me with concern. “You’re gonna iron now?” he says. “I have to,” I say, “the shirt’s a mess.” The iron is empty. I motion for a bottle of water from the table. “It’s not distilled,” says the accordion player. “I don’t care,” I say, filling the iron. “This is how I roll.” The next morning we sit drinking coffee in the hotel breakfast area. “When are we leaving?” I say. “Wheels turning, 11 o’clock,” says the fiddle player. This is the expression we always use, to convey a sense of urgency where there is none: even if we left at 12, nobody would be ready for us at our destination. We have nothing but time. On the road north I speak briefly to my wife. “Yeah, it was good,” I say. “I got told off by an audience member for talking about local politics from the stage, and I left my phone charger behind, but otherwise good.” “Where are you tonight?” she says. “Newcastle,” I say. At breakfast at the Travelodge the next morning, we sit surrounded by a large stag weekend party: a dozen young gentlemen wearing T-shirts bearing an image of the groom’s smiling face photoshopped onto the head of a cartoon penis, a pair of hairy testicles dangling beneath. “Where can I get one of those?” says the guitarist. “They’re not for sale,” says a groomsman. Wheels begin turning at 10am. Once again we arrive at our destination long before we are required. I find myself outside a restaurant, scrolling through alternating five-star and one-star reviews. Depending on who one chooses to believe, this is either the best or worst establishment in Yorkshire. The fiddle player rings me from the venue, just down the road. “What do you think?” he says. “Some describe it as ‘shocking’,” I say. “Others as ‘the perfect meal’.” “Hmm,” he says. “Food unpleasant, staff sarcastic,” I say. “But also delicious, friendly and Covid-safe.” “Shall I ask the venue to recommend somewhere?” he says. “Please,” I say. Despite our being early, the extra hours somehow get used up. By the time we’ve finished setting up and sound-checking, it is once again dangerously close to the point where they let everybody in. The opportunity for a nap never materialises. Our brief moment on stage arrives and disappears. Afterwards, a contingent of us sit in my hotel room, drinking red wine, eating pulverised crisps and pointing out each other’s mistakes. Suddenly it’s 10am again, and wheels are turning. I ring my wife on the journey south. “It was good,” I say. “I mentioned nothing about local politics.” “Well done,” she says. “I left an ironed shirt in a hotel closet in Newcastle,” I say. “But all in all, a success.” “So where are you now?” she says. “Watford Gap,” I say. “Already?” she says. “Yeah,” I say. “I’ll be home in, like, an hour.” “Oh,” she says. “I wasn’t expecting that. I’m not really ready for you.” I think: no one ever is.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Tim Dowling: on tour we have nothing but time, Travelodges and cartoon penises | Tim Dowling",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/19/tim-dowling-all-we-have-on-tour-is-time-and-cartoon-penises
2/19/2022,"Market vendors sat on the ground next to mountains of carrots, beetroots, radishes and onions. What struck me about this Moroccan market, however, wasn’t just the sheer scale of these piles of fresh vegetables, but the fact that they all had their green tops still. Bushy-tail-like carrot tops outshone and complemented the vivid colour of the carrots themselves, beetroot leaves were perky and reminded me of ruby chard, and the radish greens were crisp and appetising. Seeing all this abundance made it all too clear that this was fresh, nutritious food that’s often stripped from the plant and discarded, and not even saved for animal feed or composting into the soil. Especially once you learn that the tops and even the stalks can be whizzed up, so long as they are finely cut before blending to avoid any stringy, fibrous pieces ruining your root top pesto or salsa.  My sister in-law Clea Relly’s zero-waste practices are an inspiration. She’s always got a yummy pot of carrot top pesto in the fridge, on hand to use with pasta, as a dip or in sandwiches. Lots of nuts or parmesan are essential, and help give it a creamy texture. And always use no more than 50% carrot tops, or the pesto will be too bitter. In this recipe, I use kohlrabi tops, but basil, parsley or other herbs or leafy greens work just as well. Just pick whatever you’ve got that needs using up. Wash carrot tops in plenty of fresh water, to remove any soil and sand. Shake dry, then cut out any very thick woody stalks before preparing. Make double the recipe if you, too, fancy having your batch in the fridge to use throughout the week. Serves 4 For the pesto25g carrot tops, plus a few extra to garnish25g kohlrabi tops or herbs such as parsley or basil (leaves and stalks)1 small garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped1 heaped tsp hazelnuts, or breadcrumbs, plus 1 shelled hazelnut, to serve1 tbsp nutritional yeast or grated parmesan¼ unwaxed lemon, zested and juiced110ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus a little extra to loosen, if need be For the salad150g carrots1 small kohlrabi First make the pesto. Finely chop the cleaned carrot tops and kohlrabi leaves (or herbs, including the stalks). Put the chopped greens in a food processor with the garlic clove, hazelnuts or breadcrumbs, nutritional yeast or parmesan, the lemon zest and juice, and the olive oil. Pulse-blend until the mix is a rough but even texture (add more oil to loosen, if necessary). Use at once, or keep in a clean, sealed jar in the fridge for up to a week. To make the salad, peel the carrots and kohlrabi, then cut into ribbons. Put in a bowl with all the pesto, and toss to coat. Transfer the salad to a plate, garnish with a few extra whole carrot tops, finely grate the whole hazelnut over the top and serve, perhaps drizzled with more good olive oil.",Lifestyle/Food,How to turn root tops into a sparkling salad – recipe | Waste not,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/19/how-to-turn-root-tops-into-a-sparkling-salad-recipe-zero-waste-cooking
2/19/2022," What were you hoping for?A lovely evening, getting to know someone, good food, great company. First impressions?A very smiley, happy lady. No awkwardness at all. What did you talk about?No stone was left unturned. Baking. Broken ovens. Family. Running. Flying trapeze. Boxing. How a comedian’s brain works. How easily we both cry at films and TV. And sleeping habits. Any awkward moments?I made a mess with an appetiser – I lost my tenuous chopstick grip on it. She was kind enough not to mention it. Good table manners?Brilliant. She decided early doors that chopsticks weren’t the way for her – I wish I’d gone with that, too. Best thing about Kate?How interested and engaged with everything she was. Would you introduce her to your friends?Yes – especially the flying trapeze group, as I think she’d enjoy that. Describe Kate in three words?Warm, engaging, driven. Blind date is Saturday’s dating column: every week, two strangers are paired up for dinner and drinks, and then spill the beans to us, answering a set of questions. This runs, with a photograph we take of each dater before the date, in Saturday magazine (in the UK) and online at theguardian.com every Saturday. It’s been running since 2009 – you can read all about how we put it together here.What questions will I be asked?We ask about age, location, occupation, hobbies, interests and the type of person you are looking to meet. If you do not think these questions cover everything you would like to know, tell us what’s on your mind. Can I choose who I match with?No, it’s a blind date! But we do ask you a bit about your interests, preferences, etc – the more you tell us, the better the match is likely to be. Can I pick the photograph?No, but don't worry: we'll choose the nicest ones. What personal details will appear?Your first name, job and age. How should I answer?Honestly but respectfully. Be mindful of how it will read to your date, and that Blind date reaches a large audience, in print and online. Will I see the other person’s answers?No. We may edit yours and theirs for a range of reasons, including length, and we may ask you for more details. Will you find me The One?We’ll try! Marriage! Babies! Can I do it in my home town?Only if it’s in the UK. Many of our applicants live in London, but we would love to hear from people living elsewhere. How to applyEmail blind.date@theguardian.com What do you think she made of you?I honestly have no idea. I would hope that she found me to be at least entertaining and interesting company! Did you go on somewhere?Only the tube. She’s a very early riser and I had a long journey back to Oxford. And … did you kiss?No. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?The conversation on the tube back was ludicrously difficult, between the noise and masks. I feel that it all ended rather oddly. Marks out of 10?8.5 Would you meet again?Happily so. If we ever did I suspect it would be at a parkrun, though she’d be ahead of me all the way around! What were you hoping for?A good time and, if nothing else, a great story for the grandchildren. First impressions?Not my usual type. What did you talk about?The pronunciation of Llanelli. Our love of A-level maths. How Holiday Inns are better than Travelodges. And why pets should always have human names. Any awkward moments?Not until the end on the underground. Conversations on noisy London tubes were hard work even before face masks. Good table manners?Impeccable. He always ensured my water glass was full, and mastered the chopsticks (unlike me). Best thing about Rhys?A great storyteller and has a kind laugh. Would you introduce him to your friends?Not as a romantic interest, but maybe when I drag them to one of his shows. Describe Rhys in three words?Intriguing, genuine, magic. What do you think he made of you?Overexcitable, easygoing, not ready to settle down. Did you go on somewhere?We got as far as Oxford Circus, at which point we said our goodbyes. And … did you kiss?No. It never felt like the evening was heading in that direction. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?He didn’t show me any magic tricks. Marks out of 10?7 Would you meet again?Probably not “meet” again, but I told him I’d come to his magic show – and I’m a woman of my word. Kate and Rhys ate at Nanban, London SW9. Fancy a blind date?

2/19/2022,"The ravens are back and displaying. A blue-sky morning, frost on the ground, and they arrow in from the west, returning from Ravenopolis, the huge forest roost behind Malltraeth Bay (formerly their home was in Siliwen woods between Roman Camp and Afon Menai). Rock walls amplify the creak of wings as they rise to a ramshackle nest above Allt Ddu quarry. For days they’ve been flying back and forth to oak woods opposite, fetching sticks and heather stems, weaving them in to shore up their nest’s tottering structure. Derek Ratcliffe notes that the raven “is generally believed to pair for life”, and considers 25-30 to be their potential maximum age. These two may well be the ones to which I could approach within yards at the top of my back garden years ago. They became used to my presence, conversed with me, tolerated me nearby. Each morning at my front door, I’d hold out food (my son ate meat, so there’d be bacon rind, pork fat, chicken skin as well as toast crusts) and call them. One or both would soon appear, swooping down with hissing pinions to snatch the proffered scraps. I loved these birds, imitated their speech, seemed to be understood. Their strangely irised brown eyes met and held mine. After seven years I moved away, but offered advice on how to keep the relationship going.  Their aerobatic displays have always been something to wonder at. Ravens are spectacular flyers, particularly now during display. They breed early. An old Welsh gnomic verse tells of red throats in the ravens’ nest by the end of February. That’s at the early end of the spectrum, but by mid-March there are often eggs hatched and parent birds feeding young. That this coincides with the start of lambing is crucial. The birds fly to the nest with strips of sheep’s afterbirth trailing from their massive bills. The young develop fast on this nutrient-rich diet. By late May the quarry resounds with clamour of flying lessons – another generation of these wary, sagacious birds fledged and flown! On this clear winter morning I called out to the parents. “Kronk, kronk,” comes the response, harsh and resonant across the still air.
