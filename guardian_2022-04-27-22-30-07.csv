4/27/2022,"Over the last 12 years, Sharon Van Etten has become one of the boldest voices in contemporary songwriting, tackling issues such as domestic abuse, liberation and the messiness of making a modern family in her esteemed records. Her sound has blossomed from skeletal sadness to rugged indie rock and hair-raising distortion, while her collaborators and peers have included the likes of the National, Bon Iver and Angel Olsen (who joined her on one of last year’s best songs, the magnificent Like I Used To). She’s also won acclaim as an actor for her roles in The OA, Twin Peaks and the film Never Rarely Sometimes Always – and simultaneously started training to become a psychologist. Whew. As befits an artist of her stature, she’s more than earned the right to do things her way – and so for her sixth album, We’ve Been Going About This All Wrong, Van Etten has decided to release no advance singles (this year’s Porta and Used to It don’t feature on the record). “I wanted to approach this release differently, to engage my fans in an intentional way, in an effort to present the album as a whole body of work,” she has said. “These 10 songs are designed to be listened to in order, at once, so that a much larger story of hope, loss, longing and resilience can be told.” Spoiler alert: it’s another classic Van Etten record. It’s the first album made in her new home studio in California, and a change in weather from 2019’s abrasive Remind Me Tomorrow, one that advances the epic, hopeful side of her songwriting. Here she considers the meanings of safety and protection as the world is ending – as an artist, a mother, a partner and a citizen – and considers her, and our, responsibilities to change what can often seem like an apocalyptic course of history. You can ask Van Etten about any of this and more besides – growing up in New Jersey, her tributes to John Denver, Nico and Yoko Ono, her past life as a sommelier – when she takes your questions on 2 May.

4/27/2022,"US prosecutors charged the founder and chief financial officer of collapsed investor Archegos Capital Management with fraud on Wednesday morning in a move that is likely to start one of the biggest Wall Street white-collar prosecutions in years. Archegos founder Bill Hwang and his former top lieutenant, Patrick Halligan, were arrested at their homes and are expected to appear in court later today. The family-owned investment company imploded last year – losing $20bn in just two days – and causing billions in losses for banks, investors and its own employees. Federal authorities charged Hwang with 11 criminal counts, including racketeering conspiracy, market manipulation and securities fraud and accused him of using Archegos as an “instrument of market manipulation and fraud” which had “far-reaching consequences for other participants in the United States securities markets”. Their alleged crimes inflated the value of Archegos’s holdings from $1.5bn to $35bn in one year, according to a statement from Manhattan US attorney Damian Williams. Archegos had relied on borrowed money to build its portfolio. When stock markets turned against them, the scheme collapsed.

4/27/2022,"Berlin’s outdoor swimming pools will be two degrees chillier this summer than in previous years, in what the state operator says is its contribution towards reducing German reliance on Russian gas. Water at the German capital’s 16 gas-heated Sommerbäder, or lidos, which start to open this week, will be kept below the weather-dependent standard temperature throughout the summer season. Three pools heated by solar power, in the districts of Gropiusstadt, Mariendorf and Pankow, will remain as warm as usual. Last summer the average water temperature in Berlin’s outdoor swimming pools was between 22C and 24C. “We have made this decision because we wanted to make a contribution to the reduction of gas imports”, said a spokesperson for Berliner Bäder-Betriebe, Europe’s largest communal pool operator. The spokesperson said the lowered temperatures were not a cost-cutting measure driven by increased gas prices but a “political statement” coordinated with the Berlin senate. In a related political gesture, Berlin’s public baths have been free to use for holders of Ukrainian passports since March. Vladimir Putin’s war of aggression in Ukraine has exposed Germany’s reliance on the import of Russian natural gas, which has increased over the last decade in spite of warnings from east-central European and Baltic states that the Kremlin could use its energy resources as a geopolitical tool. The German minster for economic affairs and climate action, Robert Habeck, has vowed to wean the country off Russian coal by the autumn and cut reliance on Russian oil within the coming days, pending a supply deal with Poland. Foregoing deliveries of Russian natural gas, which covered 55% of Germany’s gas needs in 2021, will probably take until mid-2024, however. Outdoor swimming is a popular summertime leisure activity in Berlin, whose population is accustomed to a long and freezing winter but sweltering summer months. Some legendary lidos, such as Kreuzberg’s Prinzenbad, have featured in films such as the 2003 comedy Herr Lehmann (released in English as Berlin Blues) and the 2007 documentary Prinzessinenbad (Bath of Princesses). The public pool on the shores of Wannsee lake in Berlin’s west was the subject of the 1950s pop song Pack die Badehose ein (Pack Your Swimming Trunks). The city’s open-air swimming pools drew 2 million visitors in 2018, though the annual number of swimmers dropped to 1 million in the first year of the pandemic as pools and lidos restricted admissions in keeping with hygiene restrictions. As the water in the Berlin’s pools offers brisk refreshment this summer, it remains to be seen whether swimmers will instead opt for a front crawl in one of the hundreds of non-heated but freely accessible lakes that dot the surrounding countryside.",News/World news,Berlin cools pools in ‘political statement’ against Russian gas,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/berlin-cools-pools-in-political-statement-against-russian-gas
4/27/2022,"Most people know Jean Rhys as the author of Wide Sargasso Sea, a title often featured on school and university reading lists. But that prequel to Jane Eyre was actually the Dominica-born author’s last book, and there are riches in store for those who haven’t yet explored the rest of her work. Her biographer Miranda Seymour suggests some good places to start. “‘Smile please,’ the man said. ‘Not quite so serious.’” It is this opening line that gives the autobiography Smile Please its title, as a young Rhys fails to do as she’s told when posing for a photo. The biggest surprise when reading this luminous memoir of the author’s early life in the Caribbean, London and Paris, is that she started writing it in her 70s. It was the first thing by Rhys that I read and I fell in love with her voice on the spot. I can’t imagine a better way to get to know her. I’d go straight from the memoir into Voyage in the Dark. Told by a vulnerable newcomer to London from the Caribbean, Rhys’s third novel draws on her own experience of love, heartbreak, hope and loneliness to create an unforgettable portrait of its protagonist Anna Morgan. This novel is a great example of Rhys’s talent for capturing the way alienated and victimised women feel. Good Morning, Midnight is my favourite of Rhys’s five slender novels and her masterpiece. Set in Paris in 1937, it is whispered into our ears by Sasha Jansen, another outsider and a woman with a black sense of humour about her own misfortunes. Moments of mad comedy punctuate Sasha’s dreadful, knowing journey towards one of the most powerful endings in the history of fiction. Several of Rhys’s short stories deserve more attention. A Solid House, I Spy a Stranger, The Sound of the River and Temps Perdu were all rejected by publishers in 1947 as too depressing for war-weary readers to stomach. Based on – as ever with Rhys – her own raw sense of being an outsider, these disquieting stories of civilian life show an exceptionally truthful writer at her most courageous, working in the genre she most enjoyed. William Trevor thought Rhys’s I Used to Live Here Once was the finest short ghost story yet written. I think he was right. But these others are brilliant, too. Rhys often said that she regretted having written Quartet out of spite, fuelled by the sense that her lover and mentor, Ford Madox Ford, had betrayed both her and her first, adored husband, Jean Lenglet. Though fascinating for the light it sheds on Rhys’s haphazard life in Paris in the 1920s, Quartet isn’t in quite the same league as its astonishing successors. Funny, sad and unforgettable, the story Let Them Call it Jazz is Rhys’s unique contribution to the vision of London as seen by the Caribbean newcomers who settled in bedsits and boarding houses around Notting Hill during the postwar years. Narrator Selina Davis shares Rhys’s own grim experiences of prison, poverty and loneliness. Her voice is a powerful one – you don’t doubt Selina when she says: “Believe me, if I aim at your wife I hit your wife – that’s certain.” Rhys fans should go for Good Morning, Midnight or a group of her astonishing stories (I’d suggest Vienne, Till September Petronella, and Tigers Are Better-Looking.) But those new to Rhys will enjoy discussing Wide Sargasso Sea, the heartbreaking prequel to Jane Eyre which was published in 1966. Rhys was 76 and had almost given up hope of literary recognition until it won the WH Smith literary award and she was propelled into the limelight. Set in Jamaica and on another unnamed Caribbean island, Sargasso draws on Rhys’s intense memories of Dominica, where she told friends that she wanted to be buried, “under a flamboyant tree”. And that – if you really want to understand what made Jean Rhys the great writer she would become – is where to go and look for her.

4/27/2022,"Annabel Steadman was a 22-year-old trainee solicitor commuting between London and Oxford when she had a vision of a unicorn. “I wasn’t thinking about writing a book at all. It just kind of came into my head as I was walking along,” she says. “I saw this image of a unicorn, with a boy riding it. And I immediately knew that it wasn’t the fluffy kind that were starting to come into the shops at that time.” Eight years later, she is about to launch a series of novels, the first three of which secured an eye-watering seven-figure advance believed to be the largest ever paid to a debut children’s writer. The first in the series is already being translated into 38 languages, and a film script is in development. True to that first vision, Steadman’s unicorns are not cute, candy-coated creatures, but ravening beasts who feed on raw meat and have no qualms about killing riders unfortunate enough to fall off in their terrifying airborne races and battles. They also suffer from flatulence, which undercuts the majesty of their soaring and swooping with a more earthbound reality of mounts that trot along, announcing their riders’ arrival by letting off a fart with every step. It’s a high-low combo that has always been irresistible to the novels’ intended readers – eight- to 12-year-olds – though early reports suggest it also appeals to a generation who grew up with Harry Potter and are now parents themselves. Steadman’s favourite feedback is from a mother in the US lucky enough to have an advance copy. “She said: ‘You’ve ruined our bedtimes. We were up an hour and a half later than we should have been last night. But I didn’t want to stop and he didn’t want to stop. So we just kept on going.’” The concept is a clever hybrid of fantasy, friendship comedy, boarding-school fiction and the almost physical thrill of old-fashioned pony novels. “He felt the least ordinary he’d ever felt in his life,” thinks Skandar, as he takes his first exhilarating flight, in the face of a deadly unicorn stampede. “He was a superhero. A wizard. No, better than that – a unicorn rider.” It’s a cheeky nod to the novels’ lineage, back through Harry Potter to Ursula K Le Guin’s Earthsea trilogy and the horse-filled fiction of KM Peyton – all the novels that set Steadman’s own pulse racing as a child. The fantasy is so rich and baroque, with its elemental battles between young riders who channel fire, water, earth, air and spirit as weapons, that I’d half expected its author to look equally exotic. But there’s not even the teeniest little unicorn tattoo in evidence on the 30-year-old woman who turns up to be interviewed at her publishers’ deserted London HQ, where she has requested we meet because her barrister husband is working in their north London flat, and she didn’t want to interrupt him. Skandar and the Unicorn Thief introduces our hero as an uncool 13-year-old from the seaside town of Margate, whose status changes when he is spirited away to join the elite who have passed the Hatchery exam – the unicorn world’s equivalent of the 11-plus, which entitles them to join an island training camp for everyone’s favourite TV spectacle, the Chaos Cup. Margate was the Kentish town Steadman and her mum would visit for shopping trips to Primark when she and her two younger brothers were growing up in the nearby village of Chillenden. Like Skandar, she was also spirited away to an elite private school – King’s, Canterbury, thanks to a music bursary. She had her first go at writing a children’s book when she was 13, and wrote another when she was 15. “I was quite a confident child,” she says, “but there was always a part of me that was sensible and reserved.” At nine, she had kidney surgery after developing type 1 diabetes at the age of four. “I was on the operating table for nine hours or something, and I remember thinking, when they put me under the anaesthetic, that I might not wake up.” The experience gave her a useful sense of mortality. “I think it made me someone who knows life is short, so you have to get on with it,” she says. When she was rising 13, her parents divorced and her father left. “We lost our house and didn’t have any money at all. My mum had me and my two brothers. And I think I had to grow up a lot then. We were kind of making everything OK together, though my mum was a superhero. She never really let us know that things were not OK.” Skandar is also the child of a single parent, although in his case, his mum has died, leaving his dad to raise him and his older sister. There is sibling guilt, as Skandar comes to terms with getting into the Hatchery when his sister failed, and a sense of premature responsibility for a father who is sometimes too depressed to get out of bed, and whose hopes are pinned on at least one of his children becoming a unicorn rider. After King’s, Steadman went to Cambridge University on a choral scholarship. She first studied languages, then law, and met her future husband, Joe, when they were first-year students singing in the same choir. But a couple of years into her training she knew that law was never going to be the calling that made her heart sing. “I thought, now’s the time. I don’t want to spend my whole life regretting not writing, or going into a bookshop and thinking, ‘If only my name was on one of these books.’” So she enrolled on a creative writing course, where she wrote a short story collection and an adult novel about lawyers, which won her an agent but was rejected by 20 publishers. In despondency, she changed agents and returned to the boy on the unicorn. By the time the first book was ready to send out to publishers, she had conjured up a five-volume arc that will take Skandar and his friends from 13 to 18 without losing faith with their middle-grade fans. “I didn’t want to bring sex in to it, or for the novels to get very long,” says Steadman. Within two days of sending it out to publishers, she received her first offer. “I just completely broke down crying,” she says. “It’s funny, because of all the moments, that is the one where I’ve been completely overwhelmed by emotion. And it was nowhere near the level of offer that we eventually got to in the auction. But it was just that feeling of: ‘Someone wants this, it will be a book.’” Over the weekend the film rights were snapped up, and by the end of the following week, in September 2020, she had secured her record-breaking three-book deal, using AF Steadman as a pen-name because her initials were shorter, and it struck her that it might be handy to keep business and personal mail separate. Lockdown enabled her to immerse herself in the mythology of the novels. “It’s so strange thinking that almost the entire first book was written when we couldn’t go outside, but it was lovely to live in a fantasy world. I think that was one of the things that captured the publishers’ imagination. Everyone wanted to escape.” When we meet, she’s just back from the prestigious Bologna children’s book fair, which brought her full circle, back to her love of languages and also to her early days of doodling the names of unicorns in that lost notebook. Names like Scoundrel’s Luck or Equator’s Conundrum don’t have literal translations, she explains, so translators have had fun finding the equivalents in their own languages. I tell her that Mark Haddon, an earlier writer who lucked out with a debut children’s novel, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, bought a house with the proceeds and named it Dog Towers. Is there anything she has splashed out on? “It’s been amazing for me, as someone who has always worried about money, to be able to not worry about it any more. I never really thought I would get to that place,” she says. “To be honest, a lot of it’s in savings, because that’s the kind of person I am. But it’s meant I can give some money to my mum, which is the first thing I thought of. It just means that none of us have to worry any more.” Skandar and the Unicorn Thief is published by Simon & Schuster Children’s Books on 28 April",Arts/Books,"‘Life is short, so you have to get on with it’: AF Steadman on unicorns, leaving law and her record-breaking book deal",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/27/life-is-short-so-you-have-to-get-on-with-it-af-steadman-on-unicorns-leaving-law-and-her-record-breaking-book-deal
4/27/2022,"A landmark judgment that was expected to lead to a reduction in joint enterprise prosecutions and convictions for homicide has had no discernible effect, while the number of Black people convicted of murder under the controversial doctrine has actually risen, research suggests. A 2016 ruling by the supreme court in relation to joint enterprise – where two or more defendants are accused of the same crime in relation to the same incident – found the law had been wrongly applied for over 30 years and the bar had been set too low with respect to the required intent of any secondary, co-accused. There have long been concerns that joint enterprise over-criminalises and punishes people, including those who may not have committed any serious violence themselves, and it was expected the judgment would lead to fewer prosecutions. However, a report by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies (CCJS) – the first since the ruling to attempt to quantify the impact – suggests that has not happened. Data on joint enterprise is not published – a criticism the CCJS says should be remedied – so the charity analysed all indictments and convictions of secondary suspects for murder or manslaughter. It found that in the three years leading up to the supreme court ruling, 522 individuals were charged as secondary suspects, while in the three years after, 547 were charged. There was a similar pattern for homicide convictions of secondary suspects, with 296 from 2013-14 to 2015-16, and 326 from 2016-17 to 2018-19. Additionally, the number of Black people convicted of murder as secondary suspects rose from 45 to 83 (from 27% to 44% of secondary suspect convictions) when comparing the relevant time periods before and after the judgment. Jan Cunliffe, of the campaign group Joint Enterprise Not Guilty By Association (Jengba), partners with CCJS in the research, said: “Jengba campaigners did originally take comfort [after the ruling] from the fact that the daily trauma they continued to face would never happen to another family. However, these findings come as no surprise to us. “We receive calls from distressed family members on an almost weekly basis. Their confusion and disappointment in the criminal justice system is a harrowing reminder of the urgent need for parliamentarians to step in and put right the draconian measures that are continuing to destroying the lives of so many.” The report, shared exclusively with the Guardian ahead of publication, also found little shift over the time period examined in the proportion of secondary suspects indicted for murder who were convicted – approximately 40% – and that only one conviction has been successfully overturned since the 2016 judgment. It echoes previous findings that people from minority ethnicity communities, particularly Black people, are consistently over-represented in joint enterprise convictions. As well as data collection, including on demographics, the report recommends a retrospective review of joint enterprise prosecutions and a parliamentary inquiry into application of the rules. Richard Garside, the CCJS director, said: “We need our research to be confirmed by future pieces of work, but it suggests that meaningful reform to the controversial joint enterprise rules is desperately needed.” In the 2016 case, five supreme court justices said the courts had been in “error” since 1984 in treating the fact that a secondary, co-accused had foresight that the principal attacker might carry out a killing as sufficient proof of guilt in assisting or encouraging them. A government spokesperson said: “It is right that those who assist or encourage someone to commit a violent crime are also prosecuted and punished. However, prosecutors assess the evidence against each individual and have to prove to a jury beyond reasonable doubt that a defendant is guilty. “Following the supreme court ruling in 2016 which clarified the law on secondary liability, CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] legal guidance was updated and this is publicly available. “The MoJ is currently considering the feasibility of collecting data on joint enterprise cases.”",News/Law,"Joint enterprise ruling has not led to fewer homicide charges, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/27/joint-enterprise-ruling-has-not-led-to-fewer-homicide-charges-report-finds
4/27/2022,"Human damage to the planet’s land is accelerating, with up to 40% now classed as degraded, while half of the world’s people are suffering the impacts, UN data has shown. The world’s ability to feed a growing population is being put at risk by the rising damage, most of which is caused by food production. Women in the developing world are particularly badly affected as they often lack legal titles to land and can be thrown off it if conditions are tough. Degraded land – which has been depleted of natural resources, soil fertility, water, biodiversity, trees or native vegetation – is found all over our planet. Many people think of degraded land as arid desert, rainforests maimed by loggers or areas covered in urban sprawl, but it also includes apparently “green” areas that are intensely farmed or stripped of natural vegetation. Growing food on degraded land becomes progressively harder as soils rapidly reach exhaustion and water resources are depleted. Degradation also contributes to the loss of plant and animal species and can exacerbate the climate crisis by reducing the Earth’s ability to absorb and store carbon. Most of the damage by people has come from food production, but consumption of other goods such as clothes also makes a big contribution. Much of the degradation is most visible in developing countries, but the root cause of overconsumption happens in the rich world, for instance in the increasing consumption of meat, which takes far more resources than growing vegetables, and fast fashion, which is worn briefly then thrown away. Without urgent action, degradation will spread further. By 2050, an area the size of South America will be added to the toll if current rates of harm continue, according to the Global Land Outlook 2 report. Ibrahim Thiaw, the executive secretary of the UN convention to combat desertification, said: “Land degradation is affecting food, water, carbon and biodiversity. It is reducing GDP, affecting people’s health, reducing access to clean water and worsening drought.” Restoring degraded land can be as simple as changing farming methods to terrace and contour farming, leaving land fallow or planting nourishing cover crops, practising rainwater harvesting and storage or regrowing trees to prevent soil erosion. Many farmers fail to take these steps owing to pressure to produce, lack of knowledge, poor local governance or lack of access to resources. Yet for every $1 spent on restoration, the UN calculates a return of between $7 and $30 in increased production and other benefits. Thiaw called for governments and the private sector to invest $1.6tn in the next decade to restore to health about 1bn hectares of degraded land – an area about the size of the US or China. This would amount to only a small proportion of the $700bn a year spent on subsidies to agriculture and fossil fuel, but would safeguard the planet’s soils, water resources and fertility. “Every single farmer, big and small, can practise regenerative agriculture,” he told the Guardian. “There are a panoply of techniques and you don’t need hi-tech or a PhD to use them.” Thiaw said: “Modern agriculture has altered the face of the planet, more than any other human activity. We need to urgently rethink our global food systems, which are responsible for 80% of deforestation, 70% of freshwater use and the single greatest cause of terrestrial biodiversity loss.” About half of the world’s annual economic output, or about $44tn a year, is being put at risk by land degradation, according to the report. But the economic benefit of restoring degraded land could amount to between $125tn and $140tn a year, which would be about 50% more than the $93tn recorded global GDP for 2021. The Global Land Outlook 2 report, only the second such report published, has taken the UN five years to compile with 21 partner organisations and represents the most comprehensive database of knowledge of the planet’s land yet.",News/Environment,UN says up to 40% of world’s land now degraded,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/27/united-nations-40-per-cent-planet-land-degraded

The series is written by Roderick Hunt and illustrated by Alex Brychta, and consists of more than 220 stories. The books were created in 1986, and have been used in schools for years to help children learn to read. In The Blue Eye, which was published in 2001, Biff and her friend Wilf are magically transported to a different country, with an illustration showing what appears to be a Middle Eastern-looking marketplace. Background characters are shown wearing turbans, and one woman wears a niqab (a full face veil). In the original version, Biff says that the pair should stick together because “people don’t seem very friendly” while Wilf calls the place “scary”. Twitter users, including teachers, said they were concerned about the book’s depiction of people who looked Muslim. One said they thought it was “inappropriate” while another person, a primary school librarian, said they “wouldn’t want this to be used in schools”.

But following complaints, copies of the book were pulled last month. OUP, which estimates the series has been read by 30 million children around the world, said in a statement: “The book was taken out of print completely in March this year, following an independent review, and is no longer available to purchase. OUP destroyed its own remaining stock of the book, although a small number of copies may still remain in the supply chain; some older titles may still be available in libraries, or as secondhand copies.” The publisher said it regularly reviewed and made changes to its list of titles to ensure they were “up-to-date, diverse, inclusive, and reflective of the world we live in” and that it had acted to remove products that were “no longer appropriate”. It added that it continuously listened to feedback from customers, and took its responsibility to learn and improve seriously. “We are investing in our team’s development to create more inclusive content and are working with experts on all diversity and inclusion characteristics.”",Arts/Books,"Oxford University Press pulps ‘no longer appropriate’ Biff, Chip and Kipper book",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/27/oxford-university-press-pulps-no-longer-appropriate-biff-chip-and-kipper-book
4/27/2022,"Boris Johnson has been branded the “Comical Ali of the cost of living crisis” by Keir Starmer, who accused the government of burying its head in the sand and standing by while inflation spirals and taxes rise for many. The comparison to the former Iraqi minister who gained cult status for his outrageous lies came during a fractious prime minister’s questions, with Starmer saying Johnson was complacent about people’s “blindingly obvious” economic problems. The Labour leader said a mooted plan to let motorists get MOTs lasting two years instead of one made the ill-fated 1990s “cones hotline” look “visionary and inspirational”. He said Johnson was “only just waking up to the cost of living crisis” and had acted like an ostrich. Johnson accused Starmer of “droning on” and dismissed his call for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help bring down people’s energy bills, saying: “This guy is doomed to be a permanent spectator.” In their final public pitches before next week’s local elections, the two leaders traded blows during a session that was focused mainly on the economy. Johnson was tackled over an anonymous Tory MP’s briefing to the Mail on Sunday accusing Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, of crossing and uncrossing her legs in the House of Commons chamber to distract the prime minister. Starmer said the UK was on course to have the slowest growth and highest inflation in the G7, and he said Johnson was failing to properly manage the economy. In a series of targeted questions designed to pin responsibility for the cost of living crisis on the government, Starmer said ministers were making life worse for working people with last month’s “tax-hiking budget” and by failing to help those whose fuel bills have spiralled. “They’re the party of excess profits, we’re the party of working people,” Starmer said. He accused ministers of letting prices “get out of control”, denying it was happening and failing to do anything about it. “A vote for Labour next week is a vote for a very different set of choices,” Starmer said. He said his party would ask oil and gas companies to pay their fare share, insulate homes to get bills down and close tax avoidance schemes by scrapping non-dom status. But Johnson repeatedly branded Starmer “Captain Hindsight”, saying the cost of living crisis was affecting people around the world and insisting: “This government is tackling it.” He said the recently published energy security strategy would “undo the mistakes of the previous Labour government” by pushing for a new nuclear power station to be built every year instead of every decade. Johnson dismissed the windfall tax on offshore energy companies, saying it would “clobber the very businesses that we need to invest in energy to bring the prices down for people across this country.” The prime minister said a record number of jobs were being created and the Conservatives’ plans were better than Labour’s “by a mile”. He added: “Never forget, Labour-run Britain in 2010 – bankrupt because of what the Labour government did. They said they had no money left.”",News/Politics,Starmer accuses Johnson of burying head in sand over cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/27/keir-starmer-accuses-boris-johnson-of-burying-head-in-sand-over-cost-of-living-crisis
4/27/2022,"In September 1976 I was 24, and working as photographer-in-residence for the borough of Pendle in Lancashire. One of the extended pieces of work I did there was about industrial decline. A few months into the project I met Stanley Graham, an engineer at a steam-powered cotton mill in Barnoldswick, who introduced me to all sorts of interesting people, including steeplejack Peter Tatham. When I heard Peter was about to start work dismantling a disused incinerator chimney in Salford, I was determined to document the job. I was fascinated by the complex, almost balletic way he lashed a succession of 15ft ladders up the side of the towering stack, chiselling holes, banging in wedges and attaching metal hooks called “dogs”. Knowing I’d soon be testing myself on those ladders, I studied his climbing and resting techniques closely. The chimney was in a built-up area next to the River Irwell, so it had to be broken up piecemeal from the top down. The first time I climbed all the way up, Peter insisted on going first. “That way,” he said, “if you fall, you won’t knock me off.” There’s a big difference between climbing a ladder that’s leaning against a wall and one that’s vertical, and in this case there were a dozen of them, going straight up for 160ft (50 metres). There was no harness and I was acutely aware of gravity pulling at my back. Peter was in his 40s and a heavy smoker but he was stocky, strong, confident and soon way ahead of me. Despite my relative youth, I had little strength in my arms and my six-and-a-half foot frame means I’m not a natural climber. I tried to concentrate on the brickwork scrolling in front of my nose rather than the ever-dwindling ground and experienced a mixture of terror and exhilaration as I recalled something else Peter had said: “If you fall off two ladders you’re as dead as if you fall off 12.” At the top of ladder number 10, I was directly beneath the oversiller, the chimney’s cast iron cap – it was like looking up at the brim of a hat. The next ladder leaned out at a sharp angle, meaning I’d be taking my weight in my arms, hanging perilously above the drop. Perhaps sensing my weakening resolve, Peter reached over the brim to grab my forearm. Moments later, I was sitting astride the circle of wall at the very top, one leg dangling into the void of the stack, the other outside in the world. Even in a light breeze a chimney will sway and I watched the horizon tilting slowly, first one way, then the other. I still get the heebie-jeebies recalling Peter and his two labourers breaking up the very structure we were sitting on, drilling holes in the cast iron and splitting it with car jacks, lump hammers and cold chisels. Though Peter’s work demonstrated great skill, he always seemed wonderfully relaxed. That’s how he comes across in this photograph, taken on the second time out of three I climbed the chimney. By then Peter and the boys were working their way round knocking out the brickwork and dropping it straight down the shaft. They’d made a hole at the base so the rubble spilled out into a waiting skip. I got this shot while Peter was resting, hammer in hand. I’d borrowed an ultra wide-angle lens and, as there was very little space, I’d stepped back on to the ladder. I needed both hands, so one of Peter’s labourers, Ziggy, held on to me. You can see his right hand holding a roll-up. What you can’t see is that his left hand – the one I was relying on – was in a plaster cast. I got the impression Peter enjoyed the fact I’d captured him looking so nonchalant, and when a spread of the steeplejack pictures appeared in Lancashire Life magazine, he was tickled at the thought people would see pictures of him while sitting in dentists’ waiting rooms. It felt important that people like Peter gained some recognition for the extraordinary work they did. I felt an enormous sense of privilege too, at being allowed entry to this secret world. He needn’t have risked letting me climb up that chimney but he decided to trust me and that still means the world.

4/27/2022,"Girls do not choose physics A-level because they dislike “hard maths”, the government’s social mobility commissioner has claimed, prompting anger from leading scientists. Addressing a science and technology committee inquiry on diversity and inclusion in Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths), Katharine Birbalsingh said that fewer girls chose physics because “physics isn’t something that girls tend to fancy. They don’t want to do it, they don’t like it,” she said. Birbalsingh, who is headteacher of Michaela Community school in Wembley, north-west London, said that only 16% of A-level physics students at her school were girls – lower than the national average of 23%. When asked why so few girls progressed to physics A-level, despite outperforming boys at GCSE, she said: “I just think they don’t like it. There’s a lot of hard maths in there that I think they would rather not do.” “The research generally … just says that’s a natural thing,” she added. “I don’t think there’s anything external.” Birbalsingh, a French and philosophy graduate, said that she was “certainly not out there campaigning” for more girls to do physics. “I don’t mind that there’s only 16%,” she said. “I want them to do what they want to do.” Dame Athene Donald, a professor of experimental physics and master of Churchill College, Cambridge, said the comments were “terrifying” and “quite damaging” and questioned which research Birbalsingh was referring to in suggesting that girls had an intrinsic lack of appetite for maths and physics. “It’s not a case of campaigning for more girls to do physics, it’s a case of making sure that girls aren’t discouraged by remarks like this,” Donald said. “We want girls to be free to pursue what they’re good at and, equally, boys should also be able to go into professions like nursing. We aren’t in a society like that.” Dr Jess Wade, a physicist at Imperial College London who campaigns for equality in science, said: “I honestly can’t believe we’re still having this conversation. It’s patronising, it’s infuriating, and it’s closing doors to exciting careers in physics and engineering for generations of young women. Whilst girls and boys currently choose A-level subjects differently, there is absolutely no evidence to show intrinsic differences in their abilities or preference.” The comments come after girls outperformed boys in both A-level and GCSE maths for the first time last year. Research by the Institute of Physics has highlighted that girls at single sex schools are almost two and a half times more likely to progress to A-level physics, compared with mixed schools, which it said strongly suggested gender biases played a role in A-level choice. Its report concluded that teacher-student relationships played a significant role in A-level choices and that gender stereotyping by teachers, parents and the media continues to be an issue, with a recommendation that all teachers are trained in unconscious biases and gender stereotypes. Prof Catherine Noakes, a mechanical engineer at the University of Leeds and a prominent member of the government’s Sage committee during the pandemic, said: “It is really disappointing to see comments like this that are based on incorrect assumptions about gender differences and what seems like a lack of any interest to even explore reasons why. “Girls are so often told that mathematics, physics and engineering are not for them and this is conditioned by society. “In some cases this includes the expectations and attitudes of teachers in schools, but it is also pervasive in the toys and clothing that are aimed at them. Scientific and technology careers are so diverse and rewarding that we need to make sure that the opportunities are open to all, and are not closed off by assumptions and stereotypes at an early age.”",News/Education,"Girls shun physics A-level as they dislike ‘hard maths’, says social mobility head ",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/27/girls-shun-physics-a-level-as-they-dislike-hard-maths-says-social-mobility-head
4/27/2022,"No one will win these local elections. It’s statistically improbable, but the only conclusion available if you listen to all the party managers currently energetically tamping down expectations to somewhere below zero. According to them, everyone will lose. Steve Baker MP warns the Tories will “reap the whirlwind” on 5 May. Talk to his comrades and they are just as glum. The threat that any MP voting to block an investigation of their leader by the Commons privileges committee would be denounced in local election leaflets has panicked them into surrender. They are so morally vacant, they say openly that these election results will determine whether they oust Boris Johnson for dishonesty. How bad must those results be? They noisily predict they might lose 1,000 seats, cracking the “red wall” and mislaying flagship councils such as Wandsworth, Westminster and Barnet. So if they don’t perform quite as badly as that, well, they can relax back into their complacent turpitude. Labour refuses to be caught out by this old trick: no, it says, the chances of toppling those three prime Tory London boroughs are remote. It rightly stresses that all these seats were last up for election in 2018 when Labour did exceptionally well after Theresa May’s 2017 general election crash. Any ripe plums are plucked, so gains will be negligible. But even if relatively few seats and councils are lost and won in headlines on the day, what matters for general election forecasts is where the overall votes fall. In the days after, pollsters will pick over how many switched to Labour, if Tories stayed home, if northern and Midlands voters reverted to Labour, or if southern good old Tories rebelled against their party’s shame. Does Scotland stand where it did? The poll of polls has Labour 6% up – but its votes increasingly pile up wasted in Labour wards, while Tory votes are well-spread, Prof Tony Travers of London School of Economics told me this week. In Worthing, the sun beamed brightly on Labour canvassers out in Gaisford ward, where they might win a seat in this comfortable spot, once blue to the bone: Labour needs just two more to upend the council. Red Worthing still sounds astonishing: until five years ago, Labour hadn’t won a single seat here for more than 40 years, despite stubbornly high levels of deprivation, with child poverty at 23% in 2017-18. Since then Labour people have been running food banks, school uniform exchanges and a small business forum. The day I joined their canvassers last week, the FT was reporting dire International Monetary Fund forecasts showing the UK is due to fall to the bottom of the G7 for growth. That day too, Adur and Worthing Tory councils took fright ahead of the election to settle a long-running bin strike with rises of between 8% and 20% for long underpaid GMB workers. All the same, Labour stresses, winning these last few is uphill work. Random door-knocking is always revealing, each doorway a small piece of theatre, though with few clues to results: most voters are out, some won’t say (put them down as Tory), but I found a few switchers to Labour and none the other way. The talk is the usual: the prime minister’s lies, cost of living, gas bills, local drug dealing. One former mayor, eight years a Tory councillor who battled to retain the local further education college, is no longer a member of her old party – but she wasn’t saying how she would vote. Christine, veteran RAF drum major and euphonium player in the South Downs concert band, says she always was and will be Labour. We find newly arrived voters, young families and some LGBT households fleeing London and Brighton’s high prices to replace elderly Tories from previous canvass returns, bringing their Labour votes with them. Enough? Just possibly, but whisper it. Imagine the symbolism of Labour winning the City of Westminster council. No, no, Labour canvassers hasten to say, as they’ve been set up to fail too often before. They need to win nine more seats to topple this Tory fiefdom that stayed Tory even after the shocking disgrace in the 1980s of Dame Shirley Porter gerrymandering the homeless out and selling off council homes to turn marginal wards Tory. Goodness knows, the lack of social housing is felt here, where Labour MP Karen Buck’s surgery in north Westminster is a world away from parliament. The mother whose three children share a bedroom, including a teenager with tourettes who hasn’t dared go out in two years, and the family whose severely disabled father shuffles down lift-less flights of stairs on his backside to get to hospital appointments are among many tales of overcrowding, squalor, leaks, mould, broken boilers and no-hope housing lists in the borough with the most private rented homes and where a third move on every year. Voters here are indignant at the council’s notoriously pointless £6m Marble Arch mound, but as to who’s to blame for struggling constituents’ own plight, confusion reigns. They know Karen Buck, their well-respected and assiduous longtime Labour MP, but not what, if any, power she has. Nor do many know that their council is Tory, nor what a Labour London mayor can do, nor that a nearby yet distant Westminster Tory government has axed local funds. Voting in these local elections may not come high in their stressful to-do lists. Look at this political dividing line. Neighbouring Camden and Westminster have near-identical social and economic profiles, according to Tony Travers, ranging from super-rich Hampstead and Belgravia to abject poverty – yet with utterly different politics. Camden is virtually for ever Labour, while for ever Tory Westminster wins with its boast of having council tax at about £1,000 less than Camden for an upmarket property. Westminster has correspondingly fewer non-statutory services for children and young people, fewer day centres and less social housing. If it’s a wonder that Labour still wins Camden despite the higher tax, Travers’ view is that people lucky enough to have a choice naturally congregate in boroughs among their own political kind. Low-tax Tories like the Tory vibe in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, while the socially conscious gather in Camden, Islington and Hackney, paying more for pro-social policies. These ideological silos are growing, he says. When Johnson continually mocks “Islington” lefty folk (though he once lived there), Labour could riposte just as aggressively about Westminster and Kensington selfish Tory types. But that’s probably no way to win over Tory boroughs to Labour’s cause – so instead Westminster’s Labour group has felt obliged to pledge itself to a two-year council tax freeze. Softly, softly does it. Maybe this time, enough Westminster Tory voters will find their disgust at the moral filth of their party overrides that £1,000 bribe. But Labour dare not think they have any hope of winning here.
