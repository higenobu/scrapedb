According to the network, there are still “very few details but teams on the ground are working as hard as they can to try to gather more information”. The reports come after the Facebook page of Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Irina Venediktova, announced on Monday that a British journalist had been seriously wounded in Ukraine and was in “intensive care under the supervision of doctors”. “This man was not at a military facility, where according to Russian officials, they are constantly targeting. Not being at a military facility, he suffered serious injuries,” the post added. The information surrounding the case is being brought to Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau where it “will be properly investigated”, according to the prosecutor. Accompanying the post is a picture of congressional press accreditation that said “Radio & TV” and “Fox News”. The accreditation features an image of a Caucasian male in a suit with the date “3/31/2022” written underneath. On Sunday, Ukrainian authorities announced that Brent Renaud, an award-winning American film-maker, was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, a flashpoint town outside Kyiv. An American photographer, Juan Arredondo, was wounded. The 51-year old film-maker was shot in the neck and died shortly after coming under Russian fire, according to local police officials.

3/15/2022,"Hopes are high that a fabled medieval town known as “Yorkshire’s Atlantis” is about to be located and will begin giving up secrets held for more than 650 years. Ravenser Odd was a prosperous port town built on sandbanks at the mouth of the Humber estuary before it was abandoned and later destroyed and submerged by a calamitous storm in 1362. Daniel Parsons, a professor in sedimentology at the University of Hull, was on a family day out to the seaside at Withernsea when he learned about Ravenser Odd, one of the biggest of a number of places on the Holderness coast that have been lost over the centuries due to coastal erosion. He got chatting to the historian Phil Mathison. “He was telling me that at low tide local lobster vessels have seen disturbances on the surface suggesting there are actual remnants of the town on the seabed.” He started reading more about the fascinating history of Ravenser Odd and the idea started to form. Parsons is a geoscientist who uses high-resolution sonar systems to better understand how sediments move around. Could, he asked himself, the equipment be used to find this lost Atlantis, and could the story be used to shine light on the coastal erosion threat faced by communities today? Money was raised for a research project which resulted in a survey of an area off Spurn Point of about 10 hectares last year. It did not locate Ravenser Odd, but they were close, Parsons believes, and a second survey will take place in two to three weeks’ time. “We think we were a little bit too far to the east,” he said. “Given the stories we’ve had from the folks on the lobster vessels, I’m pretty confident we will find something.” Once it is located, it is hoped that money can be raised for archaeological exploration – and who knows what may then be found, Parsons said. Ravenser Odd was founded around 1235 with its name stemming from the Old Norse hrafn’s eyr (raven’s tongue). It became a town of national importance with wharves, warehouses, a court and a prison. It had two members of parliament and collected dues from more than 100 merchant ships a year. It also had a seawall and a harbour. “Those things aren’t easily washed away,” said Parsons. “Having looked at historic sites and places that have been lost in a similar way, such as in the Bay of Naples, what you tend to find is that the foundations of these settlements are still there.” Coastal erosion brought about the town’s decline and it was flooded by the middle of the 14th century. In 1362, northern Europe was hit by a terrible storm called the Grote Mandrenke storm, or Saint Marcellus’s flood, which led to the town being completely submerged in the cold waters of the North Sea. Parsons is director of the university’s energy and environment institute and thinks the story of Ravenser Odd could be used to engage with people about the dangers posed by the climate crisis and coastal erosion, particularly given the Holderness coast is one of the most rapidly eroding coastlines in the world with some areas retreating up to 10 metres a year. “Understanding the past helps us prepare better in the future,” he said. “Ravenser Odd is an incredibly evocative story of the impacts of coastal change on entire settlements. “I think it is a fantastic way to start conversations with people on the impacts of climate change long in to the future by using these stories from the past.”",News/UK news,"Yorkshire’s lost ‘Atlantis’ nearly found, says Hull professor",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/14/yorkshires-lost-atlantis-nearly-found-says-hull-professor
3/15/2022,"People in the UK will be able to house refugees fleeing Ukraine who have been granted a visa through a new government scheme. So far, 4,000 visas have been issued to Ukrainians with family in the UK. The government, which has been criticised for its slow response to the Ukrainian humanitarian crisis, expects to provide “tens of thousands” more visas, according to the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove. Three Britons who are thinking about offering to house Ukrainian refugees speak about why they’re taking the step and what challenges they may encounter. Jo Cooksey, a 56-year-old civil servant in Tameside, Greater Manchester, has been thinking about opening her home to refugees since people started fleeing Ukraine. “I can’t just sit by and watch this horror unfolding,” Cooksey says. “The Polish have been amazing, the way they’ve just opened the border and taken everybody who wants to go, but, obviously, Poland can’t sustain that. I thought maybe there was a chance that we would be able to help. I would like to think that somebody would do the same for me, you know?” The 56-year-old, who has had a spare room since her daughter moved out, says she “would offer [her] home to a woman with a child or an elderly person” for “as long as it takes”. The homes for Ukraine programme asks people to commit to providing housing for a minimum of six months. “At the moment, we just have no idea about what’s going to happen,” she says. “It’s a big leap of faith to offer a home to a stranger. You’re not going to know this person, and you won’t know anything about their background until you meet them. However, that won’t put me off trying to help.” Kyleen Kelly, 37, a part-time dental receptionist in Taunton, Somerset, has already donated money and items to local collections for Ukraine, but says she wants to keep helping refugees in whatever way she can. “I’ve got three children and I can’t imagine what they’re going through. It just breaks my heart every time I see women and children having to leave their fathers and their uncles and their grandfathers behind because they’re still fighting, and their homes being ruined and have to leave with nothing,” she says. Kelly and her partner live with their children in a four-bedroom house, and plan to move two of the kids into one room to make space for another family. “I’ve got a double bed and a travel cot and a camp bed, so I’ve got enough room to take three or four people. We’ve got a garden and a big enough dining room that they can sit and have dinner with us, and things like that, if they wanted to. My kids are all up for it. They’re all aware of what’s happening, so they’re happy to help.” She says she doesn’t know what kind of challenges hosting a family may involve, but is ready to take each one as it comes. “If they don’t speak much English, we’ll use the internet to translate. It’s just a case of going with it. I know they’re not going to feel at home. I just want to give them a little bit of kindness.” Theresa Sullivan, a 55-year-old nurse in Greater London, said she and her husband decided they would offer to house refugees “the minute [they] heard” it would be possible. Sullivan, who volunteers at a food bank that supports asylum seekers, had hoped to open her home to Syrian refugees but had been disappointed with the lack of government support. “We hoped that something like this was going to be set up back then – it was so frustrating to watch everything that was happening and not be able to do anything for those refugees and know how bad the plight was. Maybe we can help with this crisis, at least, if we really weren’t there for the Syrians.” While Sullivan has some experience working with asylum seekers in the UK, she has never offered accommodation to people she doesn’t know. “It’s a choice I’m glad I have and can make. I’m sure it won’t be that easy for either of us. But that’s part of the challenge,” she says. “I think it is scary for people to think about doing this and there are risks … but you’ve got to accept all that and just hope you can bring good about despite it. It’s not a reason not to try to do good.” Ben Fielding, 65, is already in touch with a Ukrainian family who are trying to reach the UK, and is ready to share his home in Kent with them. “My son, who’s in the RAF, has reached out to a Ukrainian he knows to offer sanctuary to his wife and children while he remains in Ukraine to join the military,” he says. The family are still in Ukraine but are hoping to reach Poland in the next few days and, from there, travel to the UK. However, the portal for visa applications is not set to go live until Friday, and Fielding worries that the government is not acting quickly enough. “What families like these need is certainty that they will be allowed to travel to the UK and to be able to stay with us,” he says, adding that while he understands that such schemes take time to organise, “This family do not have this time”. “It seems to me that the UK government is fiddling while Ukraine burns and innocent women and children suffer. Those fleeing the war need certainty now, so they can make plans while there is still time.”",News/World news,‘Those fleeing war need certainty’: the UK residents hoping to house refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/those-fleeing-war-need-certainty-the-uk-residents-hoping-to-house-refugees
3/15/2022,"Two RSPCA animal welfare experts have left the organisation to campaign for a national independent animal welfare commission, saying the current regulatory structure is “broken”. Dr Bidda Jones stepped down as chief scientific officer at RSPCA Australia in late 2021, after 25 years. Dr Jed Goodfellow stepped down as a senior policy officer in October. On Tuesday they launched the Australian Alliance for Animals, co-founded with Dr Meg Good, an animal rights lawyer and senior program manager at Voiceless. They are calling for the formation of an independent national animal welfare commission, a reform which was recommended by the productivity commission in 2017 and has been long campaigned for by the RSPCA. An independent commission could develop minimum standards without interference, in the same way that Food Standards Australia New Zealand does. That would improve both the lives of farm animals in Australia and Australia’s standing in global animal welfare rankings, Jones said. “What is the minimum standard is what most animals will be subjected to,” Jones said. “You will only get changes to affect the majority of animals if you mandate it.” Jones said she and Goodfellow had separately become frustrated facing the same roadblocks again and again when campaigning for welfare reform during their work at RSPCA Australia. Some campaigns they worked on, such as the push to ban battery eggs, have stalled for years after getting snarled in byzantine bureaucratic processes. “The frustrations over time have just piled up,” Jones says. “While within the RSPCA or other groups who were just focusing on trying to get change on specific issues, we weren’t able to dedicate the time to deal with that fundamental policy framework system issue. So we just got to the point where, separately, we both kind of thought we need to do something more about this.” The drafting of the new Australian Animal Welfare Standards and Guidelines for Poultry began seven years ago. A draft was sent out for consultation last year. It is still not finalised, and internal documents have revealed that one state may go against the recommendation to phase out battery hens by 2036 because of pressure from industry groups. “Seven years to develop a document that is basically saying this is how poultry should be farmed in Australia,” Jones said. “It is absolutely ridiculous that it should take that time.” It is not the only reform on the books: the draft guidelines and standards for abattoirs were produced 10 years ago and have not been progressed, and the minimum standards for pig welfare have not progressed past a literature review in 2018. A draft of the national minimum welfare standards for horses was completed in 2009 and has sat on the shelf. Adopting those standards was a key recommendation of a high-level report completed by the thoroughbred industry late last year. The slow pace of reform has left Australia out of step with contemporary countries on the welfare of farm animals. Animal welfare and farming groups in the UK urged their government not to sign a free trade deal with Australia because it would allow for the import of animal products farmed using practices which are illegal in the UK. The UK banned the use of sow stalls in 1999, battery cages for chickens in 2012, and prohibits mulesing. Australia still allows the use of sow stalls, despite a voluntary push from the industry to phase them out, and while the sheep industry recommends the use of pain relief when mulesing, Victoria is the only state to legally require it. “It’s very likely that the same conditions will end up in the European Union free trade agreement as well,” Jones said. “It’s definitely in the interests of industry here to be seen to be improving and to have a system that works to improve welfare across the board.” Goodfellow said laws and regulations in Australia had not kept pace with community expectations. “The system used to create animal welfare policy in Australia is broken,” he said. “Millions of Australians care about animal welfare but their views are not getting through to our political leaders.” Labor supported the formation of an independent animal welfare commission ahead of the 2019 election, and it is also backed by the Australian Greens. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Jones said the difficulties with reforming animal welfare in Australia were “bigger than any one organisation” and that while organisations like the RSPCA were quite rightly focusing on responding to urgent issues and dealing with the care, protection and rehoming of animals, there were very few resources for structural reform. “We felt that there needed to be an organisation that would be very, very focused on those structural issues and wouldn’t be distracted, lose that focus and [get] dragged down into the weeds,” she said. The alliance will serve as a joint lobby group for Australian animal welfare organisations, with Animals Australia, Compassion in World Farming, FOUR PAWS Australia, Humane Society International Australia, World Animal Protection Australia and Voiceless signing on as core members. It is funded by grants from those member organisations and some philanthropic donations.

3/15/2022,"Sleeping with the light on might scare away monsters under the bed, but it could be linked to an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes, research suggests. Light is an important signal by which the body’s internal clock, which governs a host of biological processes from temperature to hormone release, is synchronised to the external cycle of day and night. However, a number of studies have revealed that keeping the lights on at night could be problematic. Among them, research has suggested it is associated with obesity in women and Type 2 diabetes among elderly people, while a recent study from researchers in the Netherlands suggested bright daytime lighting and low light at night could help people with pre-diabetes control their blood sugar levels. Now researchers in the US say they have found that people who are exposed to artificial light at night show worse glucose and cardiovascular regulation compared with those who slumbered in the dark, something they suggest is down to the body being kept more alert. “We found that light – even [a] modest amount – increases activation of the autonomic nervous system, which we postulate increased heart rate and decreased insulin sensitivity,” said Dr Phyllis Zee, co-author of the study from Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Zee and colleagues report how they studied the glucose tolerance and heart rate of 20 people over two nights, 10 of whom spent both nights sleeping in dim light, while the other 10 spent one night in a room with dim light and the next night in a room with overhead lighting at around 100 lux, which is about equivalent to an overcast day. The results suggest that while levels of melatonin – a sleep-promoting hormone produced by the body – was similar in both groups, the group that spent a night with the lights on had higher insulin resistance in the morning, higher heart rate and lower heart-rate variability. “Because we only studied one night and in a healthy group, we are unable to say if these are clinically significant,” said Zee. “However the change in insulin would be considered a physiologically significant change that may translate into risk for disease.” Prof Jonathan Cedernaes from Uppsala University in Sweden, who was not involved in the research, said it was not surprising that light during sleep could have such effects, although he cautioned the new study was small and warranted confirmation in other cohorts and other conditions. “Light is the strongest signal to our circadian pacemaker that controls rhythms in physiology and behaviour, including in metabolism,” he said, adding the team behind the new study have previously shown blue-enriched light may have a specific impact on our metabolism. Cedernaes added people should try to have a sleeping environment that is as dark as possible – particularly for those doing shift work. Prof Russell Foster, director of the Sir Jules Thorn Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at the University of Oxford, also said the findings reinforced advice that darkness during sleep is important. “This is a very interesting study, and although the numbers are fairly small and the mechanisms not fully understood, the findings are consistent with previous observations that light at night can increase physiological alertness, reduce deep sleep and increase the release of stress hormones via the sympathetic nervous system. Together, these will act to increase insulin resistance,” he said. Foster added that the study points the way for larger scale trials over multiple nights, adding it would also be interesting to see if the results held in older individuals. “It would be interesting to see if this is an acute effect of one night of light exposure, or whether metabolic effects accumulate or decline over time,” he said. “Perhaps some individuals might even adapt to night-time light exposure over time.”",News/Society,Sleeping with light on linked to higher risk of heart disease and diabetes,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/14/sleeping-with-light-on-linked-to-higher-risk-of-heart-disease-and-diabetes
3/15/2022,"A detainee at a secret CIA detention site in Afghanistan was used as a living prop to teach trainee interrogators, who lined up to take turns at knocking his head against a plywood wall, leaving him with brain damage, according to a US government report. The details of the torture of Ammar al-Baluchi are in a 2008 report by the CIA’s inspector general, newly declassified as part of a court filing by his lawyers aimed at getting him an independent medical examination. Baluchi, a 44-year-old Kuwaiti, is one of five defendants before a military tribunal on Guantánamo Bay charged with participation in the 9/11 plot, but the case has been in pre-trial hearings for 10 years, mired in a dispute over legal admissibility of testimony obtained after torture. According to the inspector general’s report, the CIA was aware that the 2003 rendition of the detainee, Ammar al-Baluchi, from Pakistani custody to the “black site” north of Kabul was conducted “extra-legally”, because at the time he was in Pakistani jurisdiction and no longer represented a terrorist threat. The report said that interrogators at the site, known both as Cobalt and the Salt Pit, went beyond the CIA’s guidelines in torturing Baluchi, using two techniques without approval: using a stick behind his knees in stress position that involved leaning back while kneeling, and dousing with ice-cold water. The technique of “walling” was approved by the “enhanced interrogation technique” guidelines sent by CIA headquarters. It involved placing the detainee’s heels against a specially designed plywood wall “which had flexibility to it” and putting a rolled up towel around the detainee’s neck. “The interrogators would then grab the ends of the towel in front of and below the detainees face and shove [Baluchi] backwards into the wall, never letting go of the towel,” the report said. One of the interrogators (identified only by a code) said the goal was to “bounce” the detainee off the wall. The report noted that Baluchi was “naked for the proceedings”. There was no time limit for the “walling” sessions but “typically a session did not last for more than two hours at a time”. They went on for so long because Baluchi was being used as a teaching prop. One former trainee told investigators “all the interrogation students lined up to ‘wall’ Ammar so that [the instructor] could certify them on their ability to use the technique.” The report said that: “In the case of ‘walling’ in particular the [Office of the Inspector General] had difficulty determining whether the session was designed to elicit information from Ammar or to ensure that all interrogator trainees received their certification.” The fact that interrogators lined up to “wall” Ammar suggested that “certification was key”, the report concluded. A neuropsychologist carried out an MRI of Baluchi’s head in late 2018 and found “abnormalities indicating moderate to severe brain damage” in parts of his brain, affecting memory formation and retrieval as well as behavioral regulation. The specialist found that the “abnormalities observed were consistent with traumatic brain injury”. The inspector general’s report also concluded that Baluchi’s treatment did not yield any useful intelligence. It noted that the interrogators at Cobalt “focused more on whether Ammar was ‘compliant’ than on the quality of the information he was providing”. It called the CIA’s logic in justifying the detention “fuzzy and circular”. “Ammar fabricated the information he provided when undergoing EITs,” it said. “He later admitted to his interrogators/debriefers that he was terrified and lied to get agency officers to stop the measures … Ammar also explained that he was afraid to tell a lie and was afraid to tell the truth because he did not know how either would be received.” The interrogators were convinced that Baluchi knew more than he was saying because he was a nephew of the self-proclaimed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, Khaled Sheikh Mohammed. Baluchi spent more than three years in CIA custody, moved between a total of six “black sites” before being transferred in 2006 to Guantánamo Bay, where he is still awaiting trial. Alka Pradhan, one of his lawyers said: “If the CIA had not hidden their own conclusions about the illegality of Omar’s torture for this long, the US government would not have been able to bring charges against Ammar because we now know that the torture inflicted on Ammar led to lasting brain damage in the form of a traumatic brain injury and other debilitating illnesses that cannot be treated at Guantánamo Bay.”",News/Law,CIA black site detainee served as training prop to teach interrogators torture techniques,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/14/cia-black-site-detainee-training-prop-torture-techniques
3/15/2022,"Julian Assange has moved a step closer to a US trial on espionage charges after the UK’s highest court refused to hear his appeal against extradition. The WikiLeaks founder was attempting to appeal against a judgment by the high court in December that ruled he could be extradited after assurances from the US authorities with regard to his prison conditions there. The supreme court said on Monday that it had refused permission to appeal “as the application didn’t raise an arguable point of law”. After the decision, the case is expected to be formally sent to Priti Patel to approve the extradition. Assange’s lawyers will have four weeks to make submissions to the home secretary before her decision. There also remain other routes to fight his extradition, for instance by mounting a challenge on other issues of law raised at first instance that he lost on and have not yet been subject to appeal. The attempted appeal to the supreme court was specifically on the issue of the US assurances. In January last year, district judge Vanessa Baraitser blocked extradition on the basis that procedures in prisons in the US would not prevent Assange from potentially taking his own life. But that decision was overturned by two senior judges, Lord Burnett of Maldon, the lord chief justice, and Lord Justice Holroyde, at the high court. Burnett said the risk of Assange being held in highly restrictive US prison conditions was “excluded by the assurances which are offered. It follows that we are satisfied that, if the assurances had been before the judge, she would have answered the relevant question differently.” Responding to the supreme court’s decision, a spokesperson for Assange’s solicitors, Birnberg Peirce, said: “We regret that the opportunity has not been taken to consider the troubling circumstances in which requesting states can provide caveated guarantees after the conclusion of a full evidential hearing. In Mr Assange’s case, the court had found that there was a real risk of prohibited treatment in the event of his onward extradition.” Assange is due to marry his fiancee, the lawyer Stella Moris, in Belmarsh prison on 23 March.",News/Media,Julian Assange denied permission to appeal against US extradition,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/14/julian-assange-denied-permission-to-appeal-against-us-extradition
3/15/2022,"Last month, Boris Johnson argued that the downward trends in Covid cases and hospitalisations meant that it was time to scrap restrictions. Now both are rising. But the government is ending testing and most surveillance studies. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said that the rise was “to be expected” – though this foresight did not extend to having a plan to deal with the increase in infections. Instead, he dismissed the concern about the new Deltacron variant. The health secretary seemed nonchalant about the threat the virus now posed. Mr Javid may be right that the country has weathered the worst of the pandemic, but Covid is not yet in retreat. The Treasury’s penny-pinching means that the UK is abandoning essential defences. It makes no sense to withdraw funding from a series of studies that allow the spread of the virus to be mapped in detail. Without the data, experts won’t be able to effectively monitor the disease. The country will be less effective in responding and adjusting to future waves of infection. Individuals will be less able to make informed choices about the risks involved. The clinically vulnerable face being cut off from everyday life. “It is like turning off the headlights at the first sign of dawn,” Stephen Reicher, a psychologist at the University of St Andrews, told the Guardian. “You can’t see what’s coming and you don’t know when it makes sense to turn them on again.” With the end of mass free public testing, and Sage scientists no longer providing regular advice, ministers are adopting a “See no Covid, hear no Covid, speak no Covid” strategy. Mr Javid is betting on a fourth booster rollout and antivirals to keep at bay any resurgent threats. Vaccinations are the main reason for a lower mortality rate. Doctors say that there is a misguided belief that Covid is becoming similar in its impact to influenza. Flu is viewed as “only” a lethal danger to the elderly. It may be unpleasant, but rarely can cause death in a healthy person. Covid-19, by contrast, was in January the third leading cause of death in England and Wales. At the February press conference where Mr Johnson announced the end of legal restrictions, England’s chief medical officer, Sir Chris Whitty, urged people to continue following the advice to use masks in crowded spaces, to ensure good ventilation and to avoid others if they were infected with Covid. This was good public health advice. Yet that message has been conspicuous by its absence. A prime minister battling to save his own political career was reluctant to make the case before Tory MPs who chafed against even light measures. Given current infection rates, people who test positive ought to be advised to stay at home. Yet in two weeks this guidance will be dropped – and Covid rates are likely to rise further. Most people are exhausted – physically and emotionally – after two years of sacrifices. Few want to see the return of legal restrictions and lockdowns to squash an unexpected viral outbreak. Economic and personal freedoms would be best supported by monitoring Covid’s spread and giving people the right information on how to protect themselves and others. Coronavirus no longer disrupts life as much as it used to. But that is largely because vaccines have remained effective against the dominant strain. The government’s strategy of hoping that this remains the case seems braver now than when it was announced last month.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on eising rates of Covid: there’s no plan beyond vaccines | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/14/the-guardian-view-on-rising-rates-of-covid-theres-no-plan-beyond-vaccines
3/15/2022,"The enormously profitable gambling industry has been on notice for some time. Amid mounting evidence of the severe problems that its products can cause, with hundreds of gambling-linked suicides every year, the government launched a review of current laws in 2020. A white paper tabling its proposals for change is expected soon. Industry lobbyists have spent the intervening period doing all that they can to soften the expected blows to their business model, while campaigners, including bereaved families, have argued for a regulatory framework that takes human frailty into account. Evidence suggests it is the latter who have the public’s support, with one survey showing that three-quarters of adults favour restrictions on gambling adverts. A report from the Social Market Foundation co-authored by Prof Henrietta Bowden-Jones, the director of the National Problem Gambling Clinic, should stiffen reformers’ resolve. It makes the case for a new board funded by a statutory industry levy, to oversee national efforts to reduce gambling-related harm. Currently, voluntary contributions from gambling businesses – which between them are responsible for around £11bn of annual losses by gamblers – are funnelled through a charity, GambleAware. But this activity is poorly integrated with other NHS services, and suffers from a lack of research and evaluation. Last month, the NHS severed links with GambleAware, citing concerns about the charity’s independence, while affirming its commitment to NHS addiction services. Demand for these rose sharply last year, with a 16.2% increase (from 575 to 668 referrals) in the number of people seeking help in England for severe gambling issues. Company contributions should be in proportion to the harm that their activities cause, and there is work to be done on how exactly the levy would work. But the argument that it should be compulsory, not voluntary, is correct. In fact, this should have happened years ago. The remit of addiction work must also be broadened to encompass prevention. It is not enough to offer support to those individuals who are most severely harmed. The government estimates that while the vast majority of England’s 24.5 million gamblers do not have a problem (many restrict their gambling to the national lottery), 0.5% of them do. A testing regime for new products, and a cap on the amount that can be staked online, would restrict businesses’ ability to manipulate their customers into taking unhealthy risks. There is plentiful evidence, including in a new book by the Guardian’s Rob Davies, that companies have grown more sophisticated in their efforts to maximise profits by exploiting cognitive biases and disguising losses as wins. Between 2020 and 2021, the firms handed over £225,000 in “wages and freebies” to MPs. Since 2020, a former Labour MP Michael Dugher has been a prominent industry lobbyist. Denise Coates, the billionaire owner of Bet365, pays more UK taxes than anyone else. Inevitably, such wealth brings power. By contrast, there can be few people more desperately powerless than the people – often young men – who have gambled too much and found themselves in debt, obsessed and afraid. It is the government’s duty to protect both these adults and children, who Prof Bowden-Jones says have been placed at risk by “too much exposure to gambling” since the advent of ubiquitous online and sports advertising and smartphone access to 24/7 betting apps. MPs must call time on the claim that gambling is harmless fun.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the gambling industry: an intervention is overdue | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/14/the-guardian-view-on-the-gambling-industry-an-intervention-is-overdue
3/15/2022,"Jane Campion, the Oscar-nominated, multi-award-winning director of The Power of the Dog, apologized on Monday for telling the tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams they “do not play against the guys like I have to”, during an acceptance speech at the Critics Choice Awards (CCA) on Sunday. In a statement, Campion said: “I made a thoughtless comment equating what I do in the film world with all that Serena Williams and Venus Williams have achieved. I did not intend to devalue these two legendary Black women and world-class athletes.” Winning best director at the CCA on Sunday, Campion acknowledged women at the ceremony including the actor Halle Berry and the Williams sisters, whose youth and relationship with their father is the subject of the film King Richard. “Venus and Serena, what an honor to be in the room with you,” Campion said, before jokingly requesting tennis lessons. Campion went on to thank her fellow best director nominees, all male, then said: “I’d also just like to give my love out to my fellow – the guys. And Serena and Venus, you are such marvels. However, you do not play against the guys like I have to.” Cameras showed Serena Williams applauding but Venus Williams seeming uncomfortable. In careers which include 122 singles titles and three Olympic gold medals between them, the Williams sisters have competed against men, winning several mixed doubles titles. Campion’s remark quickly trended on social media, with many calling the comments “racist”, “backhanded” or lacking in awareness. Drew Dixon, a producer, said: “The nerve of Jane Campion to suggest her journey is harder than that of two Black women who’ve overcome racism, sexism and classism in one of the whitest, richest sports in the world to become CHAMPIONS again and again is why I have trust issues with white feminists.” The actor Jodie Turner-Smith, who attended the CCA ceremony, tweeted: “[Jane] taking time out of her best director speech to tell two Black women that she is more oppressed than them is PEAK white feminism.” Campion has come under fire before. At the Venice festival last September, she said the #MeToo movement, against sexual harassment and violence, represented “the end of apartheid for us women”. Many suggested that remark ignored Black women affected by apartheid in South Africa, as well as the many barriers faced by marginalized women in the entertainment industry. In her apology on Monday, Campion said: “The fact is the Williams sisters have, actually, squared off against men on the court (and off), and they have both raised the bar and opened doors for what is possible for women in this world. “The last thing I would ever want to do is minimize remarkable women. I love Serena and Venus. Their accomplishments are titanic and inspiring. Serena and Venus, I apologize and completely celebrate you.”",Arts/Film,Jane Campion apologizes to Williams sisters for ‘thoughtless comment’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/15/jane-campion-serena-venus-williams-backlash
3/15/2022,"Ivan and Ekaterina Koslov are used to being away from home on tour with the Kyiv City Ballet company. What they are not used to is being stranded in a foreign country unable to return. The couple arrived in Paris on 23 February, with 38 young dancers for a short tour of a children’s version of The Nutcracker. Just hours later Russia invaded Ukraine and all flights to and from Kyiv Airport were immediately halted. “We woke up on the morning of the invasion to dozens and dozens of messages on our phones saying Ukraine was being invaded,” said Ekaterina, 30. Sitting in a Paris cafe she raised her hand higher and higher, asking: “What’s the word for something that is much, much bigger than a shock?” “A bad surprise?” said husband Ivan, 39, who founded the Ukrainian capital’s ballet corps, which he now directs, in 2012. He shook his head. “We never, thought anything like this will happen. For many of the dancers I don’t think it has sunk in. They are in shock, they are worried about their families. We are seeing things on the television but still it doesn’t seem real.” If everything had gone according to plan, the ballet troupe would have been back in Kyiv on Monday, rehearsing for new performances of Cinderella and Romeo and Juliet under the direction of Koslov, an internationally known dancer who has performed at the Bolshoi. Now they have no idea when they might see their homes and families again. They are also worried about the other 30 dancers in the company who are currently in the Ukrainian capital, which is under attack by Russian forces. “Please don’t say we are ‘stuck’ in Paris, because these words should not be put together and besides we are so much more fortunate than the others,” said Koslova, who is deputy director of the ballet. “Everyone in France has been wonderful. We are being well taken care of so we are the lucky ones.” The dancers are currently being put up at a hotel and had been “overwhelmed” by offers of accommodation, pointe shoes and leotards, she said. Paris City Hall has given the company a residency at the Théatre du Châtelet on the right bank of the Seine, to rehearse – and perform when possible – but the theatre has its own full programme. Last week, after news that the Kyiv City Ballet was unexpectedly in exile, the company performed and led a dance class alongside colleagues from the Paris Opera at the Châtelet to raise money for the Red Cross. They received a standing ovation after singing the Ukrainian anthem while the national blue and yellow flag was projected on to the stage. “We’re really grateful to the Châtelet theatre but we don’t want to be a nuisance because it has its own events to put on,” Koslova said. “Because it was a short tour we thought we would take some of the younger dancers so they could gain some experience. Also our principal dancers were due to come out the day the airport was closed so we have had to perform without them. We’d like to keep performing but at the moment we can only do the Nutcracker because that is all we have costumes for. “We don’t want to complain and we don’t want to ask for anything. There is a war on, people are dying so it seems crazy to be asking about whether we can get other costumes sent over when we are already in a better position than the others. But dancers are like violins, they need to rehearse and perform to be kept in tune. “Our families are happy because we are safe. Part of me wants to go back and help my country but at the same time I feel I can perhaps be more use staying here.” The Kyiv company had final performances in the western French cities of Nantes and Tours last weekend and the Châtelet has organised for them to take the Nutcracker to Toulouse and Vannes later this month. The couple said the company just wanted to perform. “It’s not easy for us to organise but we would be more than honoured to dance anywhere in the world,” Koslova said. “Except Russia, of course.”",News/World news,‘We are the lucky ones’: Kyiv City Ballet troupe stranded in Paris,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/we-are-the-lucky-ones-kyiv-city-ballet-troupe-stranded-in-paris
3/15/2022,"It might have been removed from the basket of goods used to calculate the UK’s annual inflation rate but that does not mean the suit is dead. If it really were the death knell for the staple of men’s business attire then surely the Office for National Statistics would have replaced it with some tracksuit bottoms or even some shorts? Instead, what’s taken its place is “a formal jacket or blazer”. It is an admission that these two very strange years of pandemic living have altered our daily sartorial habits but not transformed them completely. As offices vacated and many of us adapted to working from home, a clear shift to “top-down dressing” emerged (remember the “Zoom shirt”?). But when the government dispensed with Covid restrictions, a return to the workplace forced us to dust off our commuting wear and re-evaluate our wardrobes in a fresh light. The transition from elasticated waistbands and Uggs to formal trousers and brogues has been a tricky one, however, and most of us are navigating our new style somewhere in between. A year ago, Marks & Spencer produced a range of “semi suits” featuring the kind of stretchy fabric one might associate with sports attire. At the time, the head of menswear design told me: “Customers are looking for hybrid pieces that are smart enough to wear into the office but still offer the comfort and relaxed style that they have been accustomed to.” I think, one year on, this remains the case. Office workers still long for the comfort of their work-from-home wardrobe but equally desire options that give off an air of professionalism. It’s a “casualisation” of our wardrobe that’s not casual at all. Indeed, the current definitions of “hybrid dressing” and “casualisation” have nothing to do with the “smart casual” of the past (with all its associations of provincial restrictiveness and slovenliness). Instead, it is about simply dialling down the strict boundaries between what’s considered formal wear and what’s not. More so than No Time To Die or Peaky Blinders, last night’s Baftas were a good bellwether for the suit. Stars turned out in a mix of the traditional (Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hiddleston in classic cuts) and the new (Questlove in a robe and Crocs, Daniel Kaluuya wearing those turquoise furry armbands from Prada), which suggests the suit is now more “concept” than time-honoured. It’s a concept that forces its wearer to be inventive and express themselves. The suit in all its forms isn’t dead; it is, in fact, thriving. So let’s take our “formal jacket or blazer” and get creative.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Reports of demise of men’s suit greatly exaggerated,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/14/reports-of-demise-of-mens-suit-greatly-exaggerated
3/15/2022,"Russian soldiers patrol the streets of Berdyansk in cars and armoured vehicles marked with the “Z” symbol that denotes the Russian occupying force. Local government officials in this city in southern Ukraine, which has been controlled by Russian troops for the past two weeks, have been kicked out of their offices, and the local radio station plays Soviet ballads and Russian pop songs, interspersed with excerpts from Vladimir Putin’s speeches and news items about Ukraine being “liberated from Nazis”. “We feel like we’re living a nightmare, and we don’t know when this awful dream will end,” said one local councillor in the city, who asked to remain anonymous, citing security fears. “We still can’t believe that this could have happened.” As international focus remains on Kharkiv, Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities that have come under heavy Russian bombardment, there is a less violent but no less important battle for Ukraine’s future going on in a stretch of southern Ukraine that came under Russian control in the first days of the war, without major fighting. Between Mariupol and Mykolaiv, both of which have come under Russian air attack, there are a number of sizable Ukrainian towns currently under Russian occupation. In Berdyansk, a port city to the west of Mariupol with a population of a little over 100,000, the majority of city councillors have remained loyal to Ukraine. They continue work to run the city, in defiance of the Russian occupation. However, the Russians may be about to transition to more violent methods. In nearby Melitopol, the similarly defiant mayor was reportedly kidnapped by Russian soldiers on Friday night, marched from his office with a bag over his head, and has not been heard from since. Soon after, Galina Danilchenko, a local councillor affiliated with a traditionally pro-Russian political party, appeared with a video statement calling on locals not to resist the Russians. “Our main task right now is to adapt to the new reality, so that we can begin to live in a new way,” she said. “They’re trying to set up their own authorities in the occupied cities,” said Olena Zhuk, chair of the council for Zaporizhzhia region, which contains both Melitopol and Berdyansk. “They are trying to buy people out or find supporters in the current authorities, and the mayor of Melitopol, who refused to cooperate, was kidnapped. It’s absolutely unheard-of behaviour,” she said. A Telegram channel set up by authorities in Berdyansk to communicate with locals gives a remarkable insight into how the Russian occupation unfolded on the ground. On 26 February, two days after the Russian assault on Ukraine began, the acting mayor, Alexander Svidlo, made his first video address on the channel. Sitting at a desk, a houseplant behind him, Svidlo noted that “a column of Russian hardware is moving” in the direction of the town, and asked residents to stay calm. The next day, residents were ordered to switch geolocation off on their mobile phones and remove any suspicious markings on trees or buildings that could be artillery target markers. On the evening of 27 February, Svidlo appeared again, this time in a dark room, looking exhausted and shaken. “A few hours ago, we all became witnesses of how heavy military hardware arrived on to the territory of our city,” he said. He explained that Russian soldiers had entered the city administration building. “We were offered to continue our work but under the control of those people. I believe this to be unacceptable, and so we all left the building and are continuing to work from a distance,” he said. “I don’t know what will happen tomorrow.” Svidlo and a majority of the city councillors moved from the building to continue their work elsewhere, in defiance of the Russians. At a council meeting held on 3 March, 28 of 38 councillors were present, according to one source who attended. It seems the Russian army expected large segments of the population in places like Berdyansk and Melitopol to welcome the Russian army as liberators, as happened in 2014 in Crimea. “For years they have been lying to themselves that people in Ukraine were supposedly waiting for Russia to come,” said the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a video address released over the weekend. “They did not find collaborators who would hand over the city and the power to the invaders.” Many older residents of the region felt disenfranchised in modern Ukraine, but these views have been changing gradually over the past decade, and then rapidly during the last two weeks of the Russian attack on Ukraine. “Of course, there are some fans of the ‘Russian world’ among the population, but every day they are fewer and fewer. People can see that the ‘Russian world’ is not what Russian propaganda promises. It’s poverty, violence and destruction,” said Anna Ukrainska, a schoolteacher in Berdyansk. In Berdyansk, as in many occupied cities, protests have drawn hundreds if not thousands of unarmed Ukrainians to the streets, often furiously shouting abuse at the Russian soldiers, who appear uncertain how to react. In the town of Nova Kakhovka, Russian authorities threatened to cut off water and electricity if another protest was staged, according to one resident who attended a protest a week ago. Nevertheless, on Sunday a second protest took place in the town, as well as in numerous other cities. “People came out with their children … there were also old people with walking sticks,” said Lera, a local woman who attended a protest in Kherson, a regional capital also currently under Russian control.In a video from the protest sent by Lera, protesters can be seen walking past a column of Russian military vehicles, chanting “Russian fascist occupiers, out!” At one point the Russian soldiers start shooting into the air. A counter-protest on the same day was organised by the Russians, said Lera, using people she believed were not local, and was filmed to create images suggesting Kherson was welcoming Russian troops. Rumours have been spreading that the Russian occupying authorities are planning to stage a referendum in Kherson, similar to those held in Crimea and the Donbas in 2014 that provided a veneer of legitimacy for Russian actions. Russian soldiers have set up checkpoints throughout the city, and Lera said two friends had told her that in the past few days the soldiers had started demanding to inspect the phones of those passing through. In Berdyansk, Russians have also set up checkpoints on the outskirts of the city, preventing people from leaving. In any case, doing so would require a dangerous drive across the frontlines. Supermarket shelves in the city are empty and there is a dangerous shortage of medicines. On Sunday evening, Svidlo posted that two city workers had managed to drive a van of medicines safely into the city, which would help save lives. The mayor’s office is putting together a list of people who want to leave in the event that a humanitarian corridor can be agreed with the Russians, but so far there has been no agreement. Each evening, residents listen to the voice of the Russians on the radio, who address the locals with promises of a happy new life and threaten criminal cases against Ukrainian officials. Many, however, remain sceptical of the promises. “On the radio, they address people as ‘comrades’. They still live in the Soviet Union and they want to build it here. We have already moved ahead of them by several decades, we don’t need that,” said the local councillor.",News/World news,‘We’re living a nightmare’: life in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/were-living-a-nightmare-life-in-russian-occupied-southern-ukraine
