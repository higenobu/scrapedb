3/11/2022,"For the first time since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Jacinda Ardern-led Labour party has slipped from being New Zealand’s most popular and been overtaken by the right. A new TVNZ/Kantar Public poll found the centre-right National party had surged by seven points to 39%, compared with Labour’s 37% – making it Labour’s lowest result in the poll since it was elected in 2017. The result follows a turbulent month in New Zealand, with Covid cases spiking, violent protests outside parliament and steeply rising living costs. The country has been dealing with widespread Covid-19 for the first time in the pandemic, recording more than 20,000 cases a day and 773 people in hospital. Polling was conducted in the days when police broke up a weeks-long anti-vaccine-mandate occupation of parliament grounds. The protest descended into scenes without recent precedent in New Zealand: protesters lit large fires around parliament, allegedly attempted to burn down the local law school, and hurled chairs, bricks, tables and bottles at police. Forty police officers were injured. The country is also reckoning with rising cost of living: the annual inflation rate is now at 5.9% and ASB economists have forecast it may hit 7% in the first half of the year. Already-rising petrol prices have spiked amid Russia’s war on Ukraine, with the price at many petrol stations hitting $3 a litre. According to the poll, economic optimism in New Zealand was slipping: 28% were optimistic about the economy and 53% pessimistic. Current polling would place traditional left and right coalition partnerships neck and neck: if National combined with the libertarian Act party, they would hold 59 seats, compared with the left Labour-Greens bloc of 58. The balance of power would fall to the Māori party, which holds three seats and has previously formed coalitions with both Labour and National. In the preferred prime minister stakes, Ardern still held an edge: polling at 34% against the relative newcomer National leader Christopher Luxon’s 25%. But that result still marked a significant drop for Ardern, down from 58% at the close of 2020. Luxon, meanwhile, has climbed from 17% in January – the first Kantar poll after he took the party’s leadership in November. When participants were asked to choose directly between the two, there was only one point between them: 46% chose Ardern and 45% Luxon.",News/World news,Ardern’s Labour party slips to second in New Zealand polling for first time since pandemic began,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/ardern-labour-party-slips-to-second-new-zealand-polling
3/11/2022,"Prince Harry and Meghan, the actor Charlize Theron and the former British prime minister Gordon Brown are among 130 signatories to a letter lambasting wealthy countries’ approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, labelling it “immoral, entirely self-defeating and also an ethical, economic and epidemiological failure”. In a strongly worded open letter published on Friday, the signatories warned “the pandemic is not over”, and said the failure to vaccinate the world was down to “self-defeating nationalism, pharmaceutical monopolies and inequality”. An estimated 20 million deaths from Covid-19 in the past two years had been “avoidable”, according to the letter, and while leaders in wealthy countries had become “complacent”, billions of people globally remained vulnerable to the virus and are facing severe illness and death. The letter, coordinated by the People’s Vaccine Alliance, comes on the second anniversary of the declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) that the coronavirus outbreak had become a pandemic. Former and current leaders of 40 countries, including the former president of Malawi Joyce Banda, Tanzania’s President Samia Suluhu Hassan, and the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, are among other signatories, who also include business leaders such as Paul Polman, former head of Unilever, and easyJet’s Johan Lundgren as well as leading economists, scientists, humanitarians and religious leaders. Banda said: “Let us be clear: this pandemic is far from over in Africa and across the world. We are seeing, with each day, thousands of avoidable deaths.” The letter urges world leaders to fund the next stages of vaccines, treatment and testing, and provide protective equipment needed by healthcare workers around the globe. Current vaccines may not work against future variants, the signatories warned. The UK, EU and Switzerland were singled out for continuing to block a waiver on lifting intellectual property rules that would enable the redistribution and scaling-up of the Covid response. India and South Africa first proposed the temporary waiver on WTO rules for intellectual property in October 2020. It is supported by more than 100 countries, including the US and Australia. A few pharmaceutical corporations retain the power to dictate vaccine supply distribution and price, the letter added, and “have the power to decide who lives and dies”. It was up to world leaders, and particularly rich countries, to change this situation, it said. The letter comes after Amnesty International claimed last year that six pharmaceutical companies that had developed Covid-19 vaccines were fuelling a global human rights crisis, citing their refusal to sufficiently waive intellectual property rights, share vaccine technology and boost global vaccine supply.",News/Global development,Harry and Meghan add voices to fierce critique of west’s Covid vaccine policies,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/11/harry-and-meghan-add-voices-to-fierce-critique-of-wests-covid-vaccine-policies
3/11/2022,"The delivery of a fleet of armoured vehicles will be a significant challenge for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) because of failures that have led to delays and unresolved safety problems, according to the public spending watchdog. The MoD has a £5.5bn contract with General Dynamics Land Systems UK (GDLS-UK) for the design, manufacture and initial in-service support of 589 Ajax armoured vehicles. As of December 2021, the department had paid GDLS-UK £3.2bn, but has so far only received 26 vehicles, the National Audit Office (NAO) said. The late delivery left the army with ageing armoured vehicles that were expensive to maintain, it added. At the end of last year, GDLS-UK had designed the vehicles, built 324 hulls, and assembled and completed factory acceptance testing of just 143 vehicles, the NAO said. Meg Hillier MP, chair of the public accounts committee, said: “The NAO report reads like a checklist for major project failure where almost everything that can go wrong, did go wrong. It means Ajax has now joined the sorry pantheon of government projects which have gone off the tracks. “Despite more than £3bn having been spent so far, the in-service date is more than four years late and there is still no end in sight. The army is forced to continue using increasingly old and obsolete equipment which, aside from adding cost, reduces our capability at a time when dangers are only increasing. “The MoD has not paid the contractor for over a year and with both sides at loggerheads, there is real pressure building in the programme. Both parties must find a way out of the deadlock, work together to rescue the programme, and ensure the army gets the equipment it needs.” The department had assumed the vehicles would be in service in 2017 and subsequently set an “initial operating capability” date of July 2020, which it then pushed back to June 2021, but missed. Concerns about excessive noise and vibration levels remain unresolved, and the MoD has not yet set a new initial operating capability target date. It also has no confidence that the April 2025 goal for full operating capability is achievable, according to the NAO report. The delays will have important operational impacts on the army, the watchdog warned. The MoD transferred financial risks to GDLS-UK by agreeing a firm-priced contract to deliver the Ajax vehicles, but this may not protect it from further expenditure, the NAO added. It is not yet clear whether the programme’s problems are resolvable, the watchdog said in its report. Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “The MoD and GDLS-UK’s approach was flawed from the start. They did not fully understand the scale or complexity of the Ajax programme and a series of failures have led to delays and unresolved safety issues that will have a significant impact on the army’s ability to use the vehicles. “We have seen similar problems on other defence programmes, and the department must demonstrate that it understands the fundamental improvement required in its management of major programmes.” An MoD spokesperson said: “As we have made clear, Ajax is a troubled programme, and we will not accept a vehicle that is not fit for purpose. As the NAO recognises, we are working with General Dynamics to resolve the noise and vibration issues with a view to Ajax being successfully delivered to the army. “We continue to meet our obligations to Nato and will mitigate any capability gap through a range of alternative reconnaissance capabilities.”",News/UK news,"MoD delivery of Ajax armoured vehicles will be a challenge, says watchdog",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/11/mod-delivery-of-ajax-armoured-vehicles-will-be-a-challenge-says-watchdog
3/11/2022,"Experienced teachers and school leaders in England will continue to endure a decade-long pay freeze if the government’s plans for teacher salaries are adopted, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The IFS said long-serving teachers and heads will experience a 14% real-terms cut in their pay going back to 2010, following the below-inflation increases proposed by the Department for Education in its submission to the teachers’ pay review board. The analysis comes as Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, is to give a keynote speech to the Association of School and College Leaders annual conference on Friday, in which he is to say that support for teachers will be “at the heart” of the forthcoming schools white paper. The DfE has asked the School Teachers Review Body (STRB) to recommend substantial increases in pay for newly qualified teachers in state schools, allowing starting salaries to rise from about £25,000 to £30,000 in 2024, meeting a commitment in the Conservative party’s 2019 election manifesto. But the IFS found the rise will come at the expense of much lower increases for teachers with more than five years in the classroom or in senior roles. Those teachers instead face a real-terms pay cut of 5% over the next two years. Luke Sibieta, a research fellow at the IFS, said: “Smaller pay rises of 2%-3% per year for most other teachers are likely to represent real-terms cuts and would follow on from more than a decade of real-terms pay cuts. There is also a risk that the highly unstable geopolitical and economic situation pushes inflation higher still.” The government’s proposals work out to a 4% pay rise if applied across the board. But the IFS said that a higher average pay award of 5% for teachers was affordable this year thanks to the rise in school funding from September. “An increase in school funding of close to £4bn in 2022 means there is room for a higher pay award within planned school budgets. A higher award than that proposed by the government may carry fewer risks than a lower one,” Sibieta said. Zahawi will also announce that he is establishing a new arm’s-length body to help teachers and schools design the curriculum and deliver lessons. The new body will repurpose the Oak National Academy, created by a group of teachers and academies to deliver online lessons during the 2020 school closures. “Instead of each teacher reinventing the wheel, they will be able to access content, for free, that continuously evolves and gets better and better on the back of feedback from teachers across the country – saving time and improving lessons immeasurably,” Zahawi will say. However, the education secretary will be accused of allowing schools and colleges to be “thrown to the wolves” by his decision to restart league tables based on this year’s exam results. Pepe Di’Iasio, president of the Association of School and College Leaders and head teacher of a secondary school in Rotherham, will tell members: “How can it be right to compare the performance of one school or college with another when they have been so differently affected by the pandemic over the last two years?” A survey of ASCL members found that 80% were opposed to league tables being resumed.",News/Education,"Senior teachers will endure long pay freeze under DfE plans, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/11/senior-teachers-will-endure-long-pay-freeze-under-dfe-plans-study-finds
3/11/2022,"At the end of one of the strangest days in the history of English football, Thomas Tuchel suggested it was “business as usual” for Chelsea as the European champions eased to a 3-1 win against Norwich just a few short hours after the club had been placed in suspended animation by government sanctions. It is a mark of how profound the turbulence around Chelsea has become that Tuchel has already developed an effective public manner for dealing with questions about the club ownership. Links to the warmongering regime of Vladimir Putin? Chants from fans about sanctions? Tuchel has been left to field these issues. But he was brusque and impressively straight-batted at Carrow Road. “The evening did not feel strange,” he said. “It helps sometimes to have a fixed schedule. You use it to give you structure, to feel safe, to have lunch together, to have your meetings. It helps you to be in that mood. There is another level of distraction with the sanctions, we could feel it and the disturbance around it, but we accepted it. The excitement and love of the game helps us. “The team showed very good character. We can be proud that they performed like this under the circumstances. The squad and the structure and the culture in the club is right.” Asked about the gleefully provocative chants of the away section, which gloried the name of Roman Abramovich and referenced UK sanctions related to the deaths of Ukrainian civilians, Tuchel replied: “I did not hear them and did not understand them. It’s the first time I heard about them and I prefer not to comment.” Chelsea were relieved in the end to escape some late Norwich pressure before scoring their third goal through the excellent Kai Havertz. But Tuchel was adamant this had nothing to do with off-field pressures. “[The players] were relived because of the game,” he said. “We were in control but then the opponent got stronger. They had nothing to lose, they took more risks and we struggled to adapt. That was the relief, not the situation, the sanctions. That will not go away.” The sanctions imposed on Abramovich also affect Chelsea’s women’s side. Speaking after their 4-1 victory over West Ham in the Women’s Super League on Thursday evening, Emma Hayes described the developments earlier in the day as a “big moment” for Chelsea but also called for patience from all associated with the club. “We’re aware of the things that are going on – we read, we watch television,” the manager said. “You know, there’s bigger situations. And yes, today is a big moment for the club. But I believe in giving both sides the time to get it right going forward. I think it is important for the players, the staff, the fans to be patient. Let’s sort through that. And hopefully that process won’t take too long. “I said to the players, our job is to do what we’ve always done and they’re the only things that I can control. So, it’s not difficult to focus on that because we’re doing something we love. And yes, there’s uncertainty. I think preoccupying our minds too much with that is only going to add to it. So, I don’t [let it consume me] to be honest with you. I just try to get things right from game to game.”",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel insists it is ‘business as usual’ at Chelsea despite sanctions news,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/10/thomas-tuchel-insists-it-is-business-as-usual-at-chelsea-despite-sanctions-news
3/11/2022,"The public will be able to offer accommodation to Ukrainian refugees as the government announces a new route to the UK for those fleeing the Russian invasion. After criticism of the government’s strategy and the bureaucratic delays facing Ukrainians with family ties to the UK, the British public will be asked to house refugees who have no family ties who would be eligible to work, access state benefits and public services. Government sources confirmed to the Guardian a report in the Daily Telegraph that as part of the widening of the sponsorship scheme, individuals, charities, businesses and community groups will be able to register to offer accommodation and employment via a hotline and webpage. Those offering a place to stay will be vetted and have to agree to house a refugee for a minimum period. A senior source in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities told the Guardian it was still considering the length of time for which people from Ukraine will be able to reside in the UK under the scheme. Details of the new “sponsored” humanitarian refugee route are expected to be revealed on Sunday with a full announcement on Monday by Michael Gove, the communities secretary. The refugees are expected to be recruited by the Home Office and will require visas in addition to biometric and security checks. It comes after Priti Patel, the home secretary, announced that the UK is to ease its rigid entry requirements for Ukrainian refugees, enabling those with passports to apply for entry online and to have to give biometric details only after they arrive in the UK. Many have gone to Calais to discover that they could not apply for visas there and were sent to other cities, while a number of UK consular offices had limited numbers of appointments. On Thursday, Patel told the Commons that from Tuesday, such appointments would no longer be needed for Ukrainian nationals with passports. They could apply remotely and would be told when they could travel. The home secretary said: “In short, Ukrainians with passports will be able to get permission to come here fully online from wherever they are, and will be able to give their biometrics once in Britain. “This will mean that visa application centres across Europe can focus their efforts on helping Ukrainians without passports.” The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, welcomed the change, but castigated Patel for the system thus far, calling the treatment “a total, total disgrace, bringing shame on to our country”. She added: “I have to say to the home secretary: why does it always take being hauled into the House of Commons to make basic changes to help vulnerable people who are fleeing from Ukraine?”",News/World news,UK government to allow members of public to house Ukrainian refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/uk-to-open-sponsored-route-for-ukrainian-refugees
3/11/2022,"The All Blacks have apologised for a “tone deaf” International Women’s Day social media post which praised the team’s wives for supporting them, and featured a player who had assaulted his female partner. The team issued an apology, admitting “we didn’t get it right”, following an international backlash to the original post, which emphasised women in supporting roles, rather than celebrating New Zealand’s women’s rugby union teams. The Black Ferns are reigning world champions and have won five of the last six Women’s World Cups, while the country’s sevens team, the Black Ferns Sevens, have won the last two World Cups and are the current Olympic and Commonwealth champions. “Forever grateful to all the women in our lives that allow us to play the game we love. Partners, mothers, daughters, doctors, physios, referees, administrators and fans. Appreciate you every day,” the original caption read. “Why is International Women’s Day needed? This right here,” former England international Katherine Merchant said on Twitter. “Black Ferns are current world champions yet this post chose to ignore their existence and instead thank the women who ‘allow’ men to play.” “Probably the most tone deaf tweet I think I’ve ever seen,” another user said. “Awks. Didn’t fancy supporting ya women’s team,” said the English cricketer, Sarah Taylor. The tribute featured a photo of All Blacks player Sevu Reece, who admitted assaulting his female partner while drunk in 2018. Reece received a discharge without conviction after lawyers argued a conviction would jeopardise his career. The judge noted Reece was three months sober, had demonstrated remorse and appeared to have been forgiven by his partner. The photo also featured All Black Aaron Smith, who was suspended for a game and issued a tearful public apology for an airport toilet encounter with a “female friend”, that was condemned at the time as embarrassing by then-prime minister John Key. The original tribute was deleted from social media, and the All Blacks posted an apology which read: “We’ve stopped, listened and we agree. We didn’t get it right with our celebration of International Women’s Day and we apologise.” We are listening. pic.twitter.com/CAE6EhVjFt On Wednesday, New Zealand Rugby tweeted their first apology saying that their intent was “to portray the many roles women have in our game”. “We didn’t get it right and we apologise,” NZR said. “Our entire rugby whānau are so proud of our Black Ferns and all our wāhine, in everything that they do on and off the pitch.”",Sport/Sport,All Blacks issue apology after backlash to International Women’s Day tribute,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/11/all-blacks-issue-apology-after-backlash-to-international-womens-day-tribute
3/11/2022,"As the PGA Tour faces the possibility of a Monday finish to its marquee event, Tommy Fleetwood has ending a barren run on his mind. An opening round of 66 for Fleetwood at the Players Championship supplied evidence of a return to form for a golfer who hasn’t tasted victory since 2019. “This game is strange,” Fleetwood said. “But I do think I’m doing enough good things now that I can push on.” Torrential overnight rain delayed the start of play by an hour. As expected electric storms subsequently hit this corner of Florida, a stoppage of four and a quarter hours ensued from late morning. Fleetwood returned from that break to take the lead, courtesy of a 9ft birdie putt at the 2nd, his 11th. The bigger picture relates to further lightning in the forecast for day two. Another lengthy break in play would leave the organisers facing an uphill battle to conclude this tournament on Sunday evening. Another example of the messy status of this competition was illustrated by Rory McIlroy, Collin Morikawa and Justin Thomas. That trio were afforded just half an hour of round one playing time before darkness hit. Theirs will be an early Friday start. Fleetwood can at least enjoy a lie-in with round one safely in the books. “I don’t know when I’ll play next but I’m happy to be done,” Fleetwood said. “I can sit on this and feel happy with my work. I think you just have to make sure you stay ready throughout the week. “It’s easy to get caught off guard when you’re hanging around for a long time to then all of a sudden have to try to switch it back on. It’s almost like, relax as much as you can and save your energy but always stay ready and in that mindset that you might be going out at any time.” Francesco Molinari, Fleetwood’s Ryder Cup chum, signed for a 70. Louis Oosthuizen is three under. Adam Scott stumbled to a 78, not helped by the firing of two balls into water at the 18th, where he took eight. Harold Varner had reached seven under and the leaderboard’s summit but encountered trauma at the famous 17th. Varner found water from the tee, with his next effort barely clinging on to dry land.

3/11/2022,"The Covid-19 pandemic may have claimed 18.2 million lives around the world, more than three times the official death toll, a new study suggests. The higher figure is a better estimate of the true global casualty figure to the end of 2021, according to an analysis by a consortium of health researchers published in the Lancet. They have based their calculation on the number of “excess deaths” which they believe were caused directly or indirectly by the pandemic. These are calculated by looking at the difference between the number of deaths recorded from all causes and the number of expected based on previous patterns. “Our estimates of Covid-19 excess mortality suggest the mortality impact from the Covid-19 pandemic has been more devastating than the situation documented by official statistics,” say the co-authors, who were led by Dr Haidong Wang, an associate professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington. “Official statistics on reported Covid-19 deaths provide only a partial picture of the true burden of mortality. While the official Covid-19 death toll was 5.9 million between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021, the new study estimates that 18.2 million excess deaths occurred over the same period, suggesting the full impact may have been greater.” The research is based on what Wang and his collaborators say are the first peer-reviewed estimates of excess deaths due to the pandemic in 191 countries and territories. Previous research from Sweden and the Netherlands has found that Covid-19 directly caused most of the excess deaths found there. If their estimate is correct, then “the global all-age rate of excess mortality due to the Covid-19 pandemic was 120.2 deaths per 100,000 of the population and [the] excess mortality rate exceeded 300 deaths per 100,000 of the population in 21 countries”. Globally, South Asia (5.3m), north Africa and the Middle East (1.7m) and eastern Europe (1.4m) had the largest number of excess deaths. In terms of absolute numbers, India had more excess deaths due to Covid-19 than anywhere else – 4.07m – according to the findings. It was followed by the US (1.13m), Russia (1.07m), Mexico (798,000), Brazil (792,000), Indonesia (736,000) and Pakistan (664,000). For the UK, the report’s estimated excess Covid deaths (163,000 to 174,000) was close to the reported figure of 173,000. The five highest estimated excess mortality rates per 100,000 people were seen in Bolivia (734.9), Bulgaria (647.3), Eswatini (634.9), North Macedonia (583.6) and Lesotho (562.9). Differences between official figures for Covid-related deaths and the researchers’ estimates could be due to a lack of testing, challenges in reporting such deaths, or inability to access healthcare because the pandemic disrupted services, the authors say. That gap is largest in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. They developed a statistical model to measure excess deaths in countries where all-cause mortality data were unavailable, which has enabled them to generate their figure of 18.2 million deaths. They also excluded weeks in which heatwaves occurred, so as not to skew the figures. “A key finding from our study is that the totality of mortality impact from the pandemic is way beyond the reported Covid-19 death count,” Wang said. “Our analysis wouldn’t have been possible without the promptly reported all-cause mortality data by week/month from so many countries. These data are critical in assessing disease burden and the state of population health in any country.” Overcoming the “political barriers to accurate [death] reporting” is necessary in countries where they exist in order to track true death tolls from future pandemics, the Lancet paper argues. “However, many countries still do not have a functioning vital [deaths] registration system. What happened during the pandemic demonstrated the need for both civil and vital registration systems and a disease surveillance system.”",News/World news,Global Covid-19 death toll ‘may be three times higher than official figures’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/global-covid-19-death-toll-may-be-three-times-higher-than-official-figures
