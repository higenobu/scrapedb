4/5/2022,"Russia’s services sector has suffered the worst slump in activity since the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020 as consumers and businesses cancelled orders amid increasingly severe western sanctions after the invasion of Ukraine. A closely watched business survey showed that new orders during March dived as restrictions on imports and exports began to bite and inflation raised the price of services at the fastest rate on record. The S&P Global purchasing managers’ index (PMI) collapsed to 38.1 in March from 52.1 the previous month, sliding well below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. While businesses in the survey did not mention the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the impact of sanctions, domestic manufacturers and services firms cited “greater economic and geopolitical uncertainty” for the dramatic reversal of fortunes last month. The US government cranked up the pressure on Monday, stopping the Russian government paying holders of its sovereign debt more than $600m (£457m) from reserves held by US banks. Oil, inflation-sensitive bond yields and stocks edged higher on Tuesday as global financial markets anticipated another round of sanctions from western governments. The new sanctions could be announced on Wednesday, according to France’s European affairs minister. The home rental firm Airbnb confirmed on Tuesday that it would be among many services firms to pull out of Russia after an announcement of its intentions last month. It said guests would no longer be able to make new reservations and those starting on or after 4 April had been cancelled. Inflationary pressures soared across the services sector to register arecord rise in prices charged to consumers, which followed a rise in production costs that was also at the highest rate since the survey began in October 2001. Unemployment increased after a wave of job cuts “as expectations regarding the year-ahead outlook slumped to their lowest in two years,” S&P Global said in the report. “Pessimism reportedly stemmed from greater economic and geopolitical uncertainty,” the PMI report said. A survey last week of Russia’s manufacturing sector also revealed activity dropped during March at its fastest pace since the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic in May 2020, most likely after a collapse in business confidence linked to the invasion of Ukraine. Inflationary pressures also weighed heavily on eurozone countries, but they were able to maintain a strong recovery during March as they emerged from restrictions linked to the Omicron variant. According to S&P Global surveys of business activity in the services sector in France, Germany, Italy, Ireland and Spain growth was maintained after the PMI was 54.9 in March, only slightly down from 55.6 in February. However, the prospects of a long and costly war sent levels of business confidence crashing. France and Ireland saw the biggest increases in activity and new orders, but were not immune from waning business confidence linked to pessimism over the war and steeply rising inflation. The UK’s services sector also maintained a strong recovery last month, registering its fastest growth in 10 months. The PMI rose for the third consecutive month to 62.6, up from 60.5 in February. Yet businesses reported that output was restricted after severe staff shortages and a rapid increase in the prices charged by firms “linked to higher salary payments and increased prices paid for energy, fuel and raw materials”. About 65% of UK services firms reported a rise in their operating expenses in March, while less than 1% noted a decline. “The latest index reading signalled the second-fastest rate of input cost inflation since the survey began – exceeded only by the record high seen last November,” said S&P Global. Tim Moore, the credit agency’s economics director, said: “There were widespread reports citing a boost to business and consumer spending from the roll back of pandemic restrictions. “Survey respondents commented on stronger demand arising from the return to offices, alongside a resurgence in the travel, leisure and entertainment sectors. “However, the near-term growth outlook weakened, with optimism dropping to its lowest since October 2020 as the war in Ukraine and global inflation concerns took a considerable toll on business sentiment,” he said.",News/Business,Russia’s services sector shrinks amid western sanctions over Ukraine ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/05/russia-services-sector-sanctions-ukraine-airbnb-dollar
4/5/2022,"Coal and other fossil fuels are “choking humanity”. Those were the words of António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, in response to the sobering recent International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report which warned that the world has a small window remaining to act before irreversible and catastrophic impacts are locked in. People around the world are already paying the price with their lives and livelihoods. In 2021, the 10 biggest extreme weather events cost $170bn in damages. Last year, the International Energy Agency and the IPCC both confirmed that in order to stay below 1.5C of warming, the expansion of oil, gas and coal projects must stop and a planned winding down of both production and emissions begin. Yet according to the UN Environment Programme’s Production Gap report, the world is on track to produce double the amount of fossil fuels that can be burned on the planet. Canada and Norway are two of the world’s biggest fossil-fuel producers. While the two countries have demonstrated leadership in terms of putting a price on carbon pollution and getting rid of coal plants, they share a major blind spot when it comes to oil. Despite the IEA’s finding that no further reserves of oil can be developed if we are to meet global emissions targets, both countries have plans for expansion. Case in point: a Norwegian company, Equinor, is now proposing a giant oil drilling project called Bay du Nord off the coast of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The project is estimated to produce up to 73m barrels a year, which is equivalent to adding more than 7m gas-powered cars to the road. This calls into question the Canadian federal cabinet’s commitment to climate action and risks local ecosystems and the fisheries and other industries that depend upon them. Bay du Nord would involve building the deepest production wells drilled in Canada; according to estimates by Equinor, a wellhead blowout at this location would take 18 to 36 days to cap. The new Canadian cabinet was supposed to make a decision on whether or not to accept this project by 6 March, but has now delayed that decision by another 40 days – time, we hope, that they will use to plan a just energy transition instead of another oil project. This is the first test of their climate leadership and threatens their claims of being environmental champions. The fossil fuel industry will make many attempts to frame this project as an issue of Newfoundland and Labrador’s economic interests. This is not the case. Recent polling shows that the majority of people in the province want a green economy. In St John’s, a city with a population of only about 100,000, thousands have joined demonstrations calling for climate action and protests extended well beyond the capital of the province. Newfoundland and Labrador is also directly in the path of many severe climate impacts and the fossil fuel industry cannot provide a long term economic future for the province. A just transition for Newfoundland and Labrador is a win for the world and for the province but it will need the support of the federal and provincial governments to happen. Action is under way in other jurisdictions and Canada risks being left behind. Eleven countries and subnational governments have launched the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, committing to no new expansion of oil and gas. Other leaders are acting as well. 2,800 scientists, 101 Nobel laureates and 170 parliamentarians from 33 countries, including many from Canada, have endorsed the principles of a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty to end expansion, wind down existing production and scale up the shift to clean energy and low-carbon technologies. It’s time for Canada to stop adding to the problem and put our political and financial resources into building renewables and electrification at scale to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Canada has already committed to stop financing oil and gas internationally, making it hypocritical to then support more oil and gas development at home. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there has been a shameful attempt by fossil fuel proponents in Canada, seemingly echoed by the premier of Newfoundland, to justify Bay du Nord as an answer for ending dependence on Russian fossil fuels, even though the project would take years to be operational and would have no impact on the immediate situation. These arguments by oil lobbyists and the premier ring particularly hollow as European countries now look to speed up a transition away from fossil fuels altogether, which would leave long-term projects like Bay du Nord even less economically viable then they were to start. Ukraine’s own delegate to the IPCC has publicly criticized the world’s continuing dependence on fossil fuels as a cause of continuing Russian aggression that will only make climate change worse. In a world facing increasingly severe climate impacts that threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people, and which will help drive future conflict, the fossil fuel industry not only cannot help provide global security but is instead a continuing detriment to it. Let’s be clear, there is no such thing as “clean oil”, no matter how environmentally friendly or unfriendly the extraction process. It’s still oil, and it will still make climate change and the global situation worse. Canada’s government has a unique opportunity to make a real impact on climate change and honor calls for change from within Newfoundland and Labrador by rejecting the Bay du Nord project and committing to a clean energy transition. This includes coming up with a plan to support oil and gas workers to shift into clean energy opportunities and other sectors. Wasting time, effort and public funding to further entrench Canada’s economic dependence on fossil fuels is the opposite of Canada’s climate commitments.

4/5/2022,"Many union leaders used to pooh-pooh talk about saving democracy, according t0 Shane Larson, the Communications Workers of America’s director of government affairs. All that changed after the January 6 assault on the Capitol and after many Republicans pushed to overturn Biden’s victory in several states. “Just a few years ago, some union leaders would complain, ‘Why are we focusing on these do-good democratic issues?’ They’d say we need to focus exclusively on labor rights and jobs, jobs, jobs,” Larson said. “Now no one is complaining about this at all. There’s a real recognition that the entire labor movement has to be involved in this effort, that we have to do something for our democracy or we can lose it. “January 6 was a real wake-up call,” Larson said. “Part of our effort is to hold accountable a number of insurrectionists running for some of these offices.” He mentioned the Arizona and Georgia secretary of state races in particular. With their ability to mobilize tens of thousands of union foot soldiers, unions are one of the nation’s most powerful political forces, and labor leaders view this year’s election – and 2024’s – with special urgency, as a goal-line stand to preserve America’s democracy. Traditionally focusing on presidential and congressional races, unions this year plan to focus far more than usual on state and local races – for instance, to prevent the election of secretaries of state and election commissioners who have embraced Trump’s “big lie” and signaled they might overturn their state’s 2024 vote results if the Democratic presidential nominee is ahead. Unite Here, the hotel workers’ union, is known for being one of the nation’s most politically active unions, and this year it has expanded its political ambitions – not just to elect worker-friendly candidates, but to help preserve America’s embattled democracy. For this year’s elections, Unite Here intends to build on its performance in 2020 when it had 500 full-time canvassers going door to door in Arizona, helping Joe Biden win that state. It also had an army of union members canvassing in Philadelphia, helping deliver Pennsylvania to Biden. That 300,000-member union later sent 200 canvassers to Georgia to help Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff win, giving Democrats control of the Senate. Unite Here has broadened its effort this year, with a stepped-up focus on protecting voting rights – and democracy itself. It is already educating voters in Arizona and Georgia about how to navigate around newly enacted voter restrictions. Like many other unions, it hopes to provide a flock of poll watchers to help ensure that voters, especially voters of color, are not intimidated by the promised army of Trumpist poll watchers. To help Democrats retain control of the Senate, Unite Here plans to deploy hundreds of canvassers to help Mark Kelly of Arizona, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and other Democratic senators win re-election. “Our goal is to get back to what we had in 2020, a steady ramp-up to have 500 people moving around, going door to door, reigniting people to vote,” said Gwen Mills, Unite Here’s secretary-treasurer. “The work of democracy is labor-intensive, is people-intensive.” Union leaders see two parallel strategies to preserve American democracy – one is to battle against efforts that roll back voting rights, reduce the political voice of minorities and enable hyper-partisans to skew, even overturn vote counts. The other strategy is to ensure that Democrats win key battleground states, especially longtime union strongholds Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. “There is no way that Donald Trump or the next Donald Trump or any anti-worker candidate can win the White House without winning those states,” said Steve Rosenthal, former political director of the AFL-CIO, the nation’s main labor federation. Rosenthal said that if union households accounted for 25% to 30% of the vote in those states, as they did a quarter-century ago, instead of 15% 20% as they do now, Trump could not have won those states in 2016, nor win them in 2024. Rosenthal has founded a group, In Union, that is reaching out to hundreds of thousands of former union members in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – they perhaps lost their jobs and union membership when their factories closed. In Union seeks to explain to these voters which candidates are pro-worker and which aren’t. Thus far In Union has communicated with 1.2 million voters in those three states (including many non-union members who support unions) — and hopes to get funding to reach out to another 3 million. Backed by unions and foundations, In Union seeks to build trust with those voters and explain, for instance, how Joe Biden would do more for blue-collar workers than Trump would. “What these voters are yearning for is a place they can go to to get information they trust,” Rosenthal said. “There’s a huge role for unions to play in this right now.” Many labor leaders say Democratic lawmakers have hurt their party’s cause by doing little in recent decades to stop union membership from declining – a trend Joe Biden seems eager to reverse and many Republicans seem eager to accelerate. Unions often help Democrats by explaining to workers which party will do more for them. Unions have also helped prevent workers from growing resentful and embracing rightwing populists like Trump by helping assure economic gains for workers and by reducing racial resentment among white workers. “Unions remain the only set of organizations in the US that can help prevent working-class whites from going conservative,” said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University. Paul Spink, the head of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in Wisconsin, said one way to help save democracy would be to re-elect Tony Evers, Wisconsin’s Democratic governor. Spink said Republicans have so gerrymandered Wisconsin’s legislature that they are close to having a veto-proof supermajority even though Republicans often win less than 50% of the statewide vote. “In recent months, there’ve been at least five or six bills the legislature passed to limit voting rights and undermine elections,” Spink said. “We’re trying very hard to keep a Democratic governor in this state to block those.” Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, says her union fights to protect democracy in many ways, for example, by opposing book bans and defending teachers who face punishment for teaching about racism. “In many countries, labor unions have been a bulwark against authoritarianism,” Weingarten said. She said her union might endorse some non-Trumpist Republicans like Lynn Cheney, who oppose the “big lie” and undermining fair elections. That way, in places where Democrats have scant chance of winning, her union might help elect Republicans who oppose many Republicans’ increasing embrace of authoritarianism. Labor’s pro-democracy efforts have taken many forms. The Service Employees International Union ran internet ads that criticized Coca-Cola, Delta Air Lines and Home Depot for donating to GOP lawmakers who backed new voting restrictions. Unite Here co-sponsored a “freedom ride” of buses to Washington to urge senators to enact new voting rights legislation. “I feel that work for democracy should be year-round,” said Unite Here’s Mills. “We try to keep a drum beat year in and year out: do democracy at work, do democracy at the doors, do democracy at the polls, do democracy in the capital.” Unite Here trains hotel workers to become leaders, with one winning a seat on the Phoenix city council. It pushed lawmakers to slam the Cyber Ninjas’ much-derided election review in Arizona. United Here says its canvassers knocked on 1m doors in Arizona in 2020 and talked with 125,000 infrequent voters, many of whom voted for Biden. It boasts that that helped assure Biden’s 10,457-vote victory in the state. “I want other unions to have more people canvassing in these races, to do it in every state,” said Susan Minato, co-president of Unite Here Local 11 in Arizona and southern California. “That would be huge.”",News/US news,‘January 6 was a real wake-up call’: US unions fight to save democracy,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/05/us-unions-democracy-capitol-attack
4/5/2022,"This low-budget work by British director Ben Charles Edwards is a bit all over the place, despite its restricted use of locations. It revolves around an unhappy American family in an isolated house where things go bump in the night, leaving youngest child Michael (Keaton Tetlow, very impressive) extremely worried about what’s under his bed. Unfortunately, dad Richard (Nicholas Tucci) is too busy going off on business trips to help, and Michael’s big sister Donna (Page Ruth) has her own things going on, including getting drunk and hating on frosty Coral (Camilla Rutherford), formerly the live-in nanny but now pregnant with Richard’s child and about to become Michael and Donna’s stepmother. Coral certainly doesn’t make it easy for the kids to bond with her, given her propensity to use a creepy, rigid white plastic face mask that appears to have some cosmetic function. Instead it makes her look as if she’s channelling Edith Scob from Georges Franju’s classic body horror pic from 1960, Eyes Without a Face. The cast is rounded out by a older woman next door with candyfloss hair (Colleen Heidemann) and the kids’ mentally disturbed mother Linda (Sandra Andreis). The editing is intentionally choppy and unsettling, and switches back and forth between the various atomised characters, who mostly seem to be alone or only briefly have intimate conversations with one another; this is either to reflect their alienation or because of Covid-19 protocols, or maybe both. The vagueness around the supernatural elements is intriguing but Edwards can’t quite kick the whole thing up a notch to make the material really thematically rich, and relies too much on sonically driven jump scares. In the end, it doesn’t quite qualify for the label of elevated horror – the fancy arthouse kind of scary movie, like Ari Aster’s Midsommar or Jordan Peele’s Get Out. But clearly it’s trying; it’s a few steps up the stairs if not fully elevated.  Father of Flies is available on 11 April on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,Father of Flies review – unsettling creepy-mask horror is all over the place,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/05/father-of-flies-review-unsettling-creepy-mask-horror-is-all-over-the-place
4/5/2022,"The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says a Labor government will consider further support to ease cost of living pressures if necessary once the temporary cut to fuel excise ends in September. In his budget reply speech in Canberra on Tuesday, Chalmers also committed to improving the quality of government spending, saying the Coalition’s budget handed down last week was “chock-full” of waste that could be trimmed. The pledge to assess cost of living pressures comes as the reserve bank warned on Tuesday that inflationary pressures would continue to mount “over coming quarters”, arising from higher petrol and commodity prices.Underlying annual inflation is at 2.6%, while in headline terms it is 3.5%. Chalmers said that if Labor formed government it would have the opportunity to “reorient” the budget before the end of the year, and said it would consider the economic circumstances at the time as it assessed extending support for cost of living pressures. “We’ve said it’s hard to imagine a world where the cash handouts in the current budget will continue indefinitely, and that’s just been upfront about the pressures in the budget,” he said. “Having said that, clearly if we are putting a budget together whenever it might be on the advice of the Treasury, clearly we will play the cards that we are dealt and if there is a need for more support, then clearly we will look at that. “But our starting point is that the support that passed through this parliament in the middle of last week is temporary.” On the task of fiscal repair, Chalmers criticised the government for the short-term nature of its budget and paraphrased Kevin Rudd’s criticism of the Coalition’s profligacy. “To paraphrase another Queenslander – I say this to Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg: this reckless rorting and wasteful spending must stop,” Chalmers said. “If it’s not the time to flick a switch to austerity, it is the time to flick a switch to quality.” When asked about what savings Labor would make, Chalmers said he believed there was an opportunity to improve the budget by looking at quality investments and also targeting multinationals to ensure they paid their “fair share” of tax. “There is a gap, I think, when it comes to budget repair in the future,” he said. “There is a task to deal with the stupendous waste and rorts that we’ve seen in the budget. Discretionary fund after discretionary fund, allocated by colour-coded spreadsheet, that is a problem in the budget. “Because every dollar wasted in that fashion is a dollar you can’t invest in the economy or you can’t provide support for people doing it tough. “There is an opportunity to reorient the budget, which we would like to get the opportunity to do before the end of the year, into more quality investments.” Chalmers nominated spending on government contractors as one measure Labor may change, saying it could save in the “low billions”. He said a Labor government would also look to “trim” discretionary funding programs, but said it was difficult in opposition to know what funding had been committed and where it was being spent. Chalmers also reaffirmed Labor’s commitment to the controversial stage three tax cuts due to come into effect in 2024, and criticised the Coalition’s 23.9% tax to GDP cap as “arbitrary”, saying it had been imposed for political reasons. He was pessimistic about the near-term prospect of being able to deliver a surplus, saying both the budget and the most recent intergenerational report indicated it would be “some time” before the budget was back in the black. Chalmers’s budget in reply speech came as the prime minister, Scott Morrison, sought to take credit for falling fuel prices, holding a press conference at a petrol station in Sydney to spruik the cut to excise announced in last week’s budget. “I’m very pleased to see already what we thought might even take a bit longer than this, that we’re seeing that cost of living relief flow through to Australian families, for individuals as they’re going off to work, getting around the city and ensuring that they can get that cost of living relief now,” Morrison said. “Cost of living relief that’s been provided by good economic management, strong budget management.” Petrol prices have dropped markedly since the budget, but this has been credited mostly to changes in the global oil market price rather than the 22-cent a litre cut to excise. When Morrison was asked if he would also take responsibility for petrol prices going up before the election, he said: “Prices will still move around, but what I do know is they’ll be 22 cents a litre less than what they would otherwise be.”",News/Australia news,Labor flags further cost of living support if elected and attacks ‘wasteful spending’ Coalition budget,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/labor-flags-further-cost-of-living-support-if-elected-and-attacks-wasteful-spending-in-coalition-budget
4/5/2022,"Nearly 1,400 people in Afghanistan who were issued with emergency visas but never made it to Australia have had those approvals lapse, a Senate inquiry has revealed. A unanimous committee report on Tuesday warned that the “tragic” situation in Afghanistan “continues to worsen” since the Taliban took over in August, and said thousands of applicants for Australian humanitarian visas had been left in the dark about progress. The Department of Home Affairs must “urgently improve its processes and communication in relation to Afghan visa applicants”, said the report by the Senate’s Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. The report also called on the department to ensure help for people fleeing the war in Ukraine does “not come at the cost of slowing the processing of applications from the Afghan intake”, saying resources must increase to deal with both crises urgently. The committee that investigated Australia’s involvement in Afghanistan published its final report on Tuesday. It is understood the drafting was largely finished before the chair, Labor senator Kimberley Kitching, died suddenly last month. The report, which now appears in the name of the deputy chair, Liberal senator Eric Abetz, includes stark findings about emergency visas issued at the height of the evacuation operation from Afghanistan last August. These visas – known as subclass 449 visas – were granted so that people could quickly flee Afghanistan but they were only valid for three months. Australia’s last-ditch evacuation mission – launched in the days after Kabul fell to the Taliban – lifted 4,168 people out of the Afghan capital over the course of nine days. But many with permission to come to Australia were left behind. The government decided in November to extend the short-term visas only for those who had either already arrived in Australia or those who remained overseas but had links to the program for Afghan locally engaged employees (such as interpreters and guards). “When asked how many people have had their subclass 499 visa lapse without being renewed, the home affairs department advised that, as at 31 December 2021, a total of 1,520 subclass 449 visas granted to evacuees from Afghanistan have ceased,” the committee report said. The majority – 1,398 – were people “who never entered Australia”. There were also 53 who were in Australia who held a different visa, and 69 who were in Australia temporarily before reaching New Zealand. The Senate report said these 1,398 individuals, who were deemed worthy of evacuation to Australia but were not successful in travelling to the country, had “lost the ability to travel to Australia on an emergency visa”. That meant they “must lodge applications in other general visa categories, all of which are associated with lengthy wait times”. The committee called on the government to reinstate these emergency visas “for all individuals remaining outside of Australia who were initially issued these visas during the evacuation”. The Senate committee welcomed the government’s budget announcement last week that it would offer an additional 16,500 humanitarian places for Afghan nationals over the next four years. Those places are on top of the existing intake. But the committee said delays had left “thousands of applicants unsure as to whether any progress has been made on their applications”. In total, about 6,500 people have successfully reached Australia from Afghanistan since 18 August, including by commercial flights. The Department of Home Affairs revealed in January that it had more than 32,500 applications for humanitarian program visas from Afghan nationals “on hand”, representing about 144,000 people, because some applications are for family groups. “Despite Home Affairs initially telling the committee in November 2021 that it was aiming to provide initial receipts for all Afghan humanitarian visa applications by the end of 2021, the department subsequently told the committee that over 23,000 of these applications were still yet to be registered as at 5 January 2022,” the report said. The six recommendations in Tuesday’s report include a call for the department to “urgently improve its processes and communication in relation to Afghan visa applicants”. That should include urgently sending acknowledgments to all visa applicants, and publishing more detailed criteria and guidance about how humanitarian visas for the Afghan cohort will be prioritised, together with the expected average timeframes. It also said Australia should issue additional visas as necessary “to overseas split family members of evacuees in Australia, to ensure family unity is preserved in permanent visa applications”. The Department of Home Affairs has maintained that applications are “acknowledged in writing and processed as quickly as possible”. Officials told the committee the department did not have a physical presence in Afghanistan and “visa processing presents significant challenges and security concerns”. More broadly, the committee recommended the Australian government give ongoing, targeted funding to assist the people of Afghanistan as the situation continues to worsen. That “may need to increase in response to the scale of increased need”. “However, importantly, any approach taken must also emphasise the clear international expectation that the Taliban do not interfere with the provision of aid to the people of Afghanistan,” the report said. At the beginning of the report, Abetz wrote that he and the other committee members wished to acknowledge Kitching’s “outstanding work” in overseeing the inquiry and they were deeply shocked and saddened at her death. “Senator Kitching played a significant role as … chair, including overseeing this inquiry and the production of this report right up until the final draft prepared for the Committee’s consideration,” he wrote. “Following her sudden passing, other committee members have taken over the last phase of the inquiry to present this final report to the Senate.”",News/Australia news,"Nearly 1,400 Afghans granted emergency visas never made it to Australia",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/nearly-1400-afghans-granted-emergency-visas-never-made-it-to-australia
4/5/2022,"What sort of political party fails to select its candidates until the election is virtually upon them? What sort of political party finds itself being sued by its members and castigated by its own MPs using parliamentary privilege? The answer is a party that is facing a cultural crisis. In the last 12 months, both the Labor and Liberal parties have been dealing with internal strife that has burst forth into the public domain. For Labor, it was allegations of rampant branch stacking in the Victorian branch, litigation over intervention by the national executive in preselections for the Victorian senate ticket and allegations of bullying of the late senator Kimberley Kitching. For the Liberal party, it has been the manufactured crisis in the NSW division over preselections. It has led to litigation, and free and unflattering character assessments of the prime minister, Scott Morrison, from within his own party. On one level it’s tempting to see these crises as a dysfunctional family soap opera – the outcome of petty politics and personal rivalry. But there is much more at stake. Democracy depends on having at least two functioning, robust parties that operate according to something more than the law of the jungle. Labor’s internal woes are a story for another day. The current crisis in the NSW Liberals over preselection raise serious issues about control of the party, integrity and what it means to be a member of a political party. Matthew Camenzuli, a member of the NSW Liberals’ state executive, thinks political parties are the sum of their members and he sought to assert their rights in the courts – specifically, to choose candidates. Morrison and the factional apparatchiks in the Liberal party begged to differ. The NSW Liberal party made changes to its rules for preselection in 2018 after a push by the right faction to give branch members a bigger say. The right, led by former prime minister Tony Abbott, argued that the membership out there in the branches was more conservative than the party machine and it was high time members had a bigger say in who represented them. The Warringah rules, as they are known, were duly adopted, bringing a greater degree of grassroots democracy and a diminution of the power for the factional organisers. Factional organisers are the people who work the room, get elected to the various bodies of the party and control branch numbers, sometimes by bringing in new members loyal to them. At least that was the thinking. But in the first real test of the new preselection processes – the 2022 federal election – the factions have reasserted themselves. The decision in the court of appeal is a technical one: the court decided the case mainly on the issue of “justiciability” – that it was not the role of courts to involve themselves in adjudicating on the internal rules of unincorporated political parties. It did not deal with the fairness or moral correctness of what has happened. That remains one for the NSW Liberal party organisation to tackle. The fact is that the factional warlords have triumphed over the membership, again. The “inconvenient” new Warringah rules were sidestepped by the party heavyweights. Much of the blame has been sheeted home to the prime minister’s representative on the NSW state executive, his immigration minister, Alex Hawke. By failing to turn up for months to vet possible candidates, Hawke engineered a crisis, where just a few weeks from the May poll there were no candidates. Few believe he would have done so without a wink from his boss. The factions then attempted to carve up the spoils – as they had done in the past. But some members of the NSW Liberals were not buying this attempt to sidestep their new democratic rights to participate in preselections. The result has been expensive and embarrassing litigation, which has ultimately rewarded those who chose to winkle their way around the party rules. The big winner is the prime minister’s centre right faction and Hawke himself, who avoided having to face an uncertain branch plebiscite in his northern Sydney seat of Mitchell, an area where allegations of branch stacking are common. Yes, there are good reasons for giving the prime minister of the day or the head office a say in who becomes the candidate. They may have a star candidate or want to achieve greater gender equality in the party. But that wasn’t what the NSW Liberals voted for in 2018. It raises the question that all major parties must grapple with: who’s party is it? In the US, political parties choose their candidates though primaries where thousands of people vote, even those who are not party members. It can lead to some odd populist results and arguably leads to candidates from the extremes of the party rather than the middle. But ordinary people get to participate. Americans proudly declare themselves Democrats or Republicans and engage in their political process. In Australia it seems candidates are chosen by the prime minister or the leader, or at best a small cabal of factional power-brokers, who might be motivated by shoring up their own power bases in the party. Is that really preferable? All three major Australian parties are struggling to maintain their membership. In NSW, the most populous state, the NSW Liberal party claims 11,000 members but some say it is lower – below 10,000. NSW Labor has perhaps a few thousand more thanks to its affiliation with the unions. In a state with a population of 8.2 million people it’s hardly a ringing endorsement of participatory democracy. It’s easy to understand why the courts would not wish to wade into the murky pool of internal party politics. But it is certainly one for the major political parties. Just ask the independents, who have benefited from perception that our major political parties are moving further away from local communities and their real concerns. The crisis that has wracked the Liberal party is really a deeper crisis of democracy.",News/Australia news,The Liberal party crisis is not a dysfunctional family soap opera – democracy is at stake,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/the-liberal-party-crisis-is-not-a-dysfunctional-family-soap-opera-democracy-is-at-stake
4/5/2022,"An Aboriginal-led coalition of legal and health experts has accused the Queensland government and opposition of “kicking the can down the road” while children are locked behind bars, after both refused to back calls to raise the age of criminal responsibility. In Queensland, as in all other Australian states and territories, children as young as 10 can be held in watchhouses and hauled before courts to face criminal charges. On Tuesday, the Raise the Age coalition published an open letter to premier Annastacia Palaszczuk expressing deep concern that their expertise “appears to have been ignored” by a parliamentary committee that rejected calls to raise the minimum age of criminal responsibility to 14 in the state. The letter was signed by more than 20 health, legal, youth and child developmental organisations whose experts made submissions to that inquiry. “We unanimously advised the Committee to raise the age of criminal responsibility to at least 14 years old,” the letter read. “This is consistent with the overwhelming medical evidence, unanimous support from more than 300 written submissions to the inquiry, and the views of the majority of witnesses who provided evidence at the inquiry’s public hearing.” The premier’s office responded to questions from Guardian Australia with a statement saying that Queensland was “taking part in the national process agreed to at the national meeting of attorneys-general which is already on the public record”. In November, that meeting agreed to “develop a proposal” to increase the age of criminal responsibility to 12. Cheryl Axleby, co-chair of Change the Record, said talk about “waiting for a national consensus” was “just another excuse for kicking the can down the road”. “Three years ago attorneys general committed to explore options to raise the age and they have done nothing since then,” Axleby said. “It is unforgivable that in 2022, after the Closing the Gap Agreement and countless inquiries and reports, we still have governments like Queensland’s umming and ahhing about whether or not to raise the age of criminal responsibility and keep our kids out of prison.” The premier’s office directed questions about the parliamentary committee to its chair, Labor’s Corrine McMillan. The member for Mansfield’s office advised she was on leave. Its deputy chair, the Liberal National party’s Stephen Bennett, agreed the evidence “clearly says that we should go to 14”, but said doing so now amounted to “a utopia of desires”. “Overwhelming the committee heard strong medical and social reasons why we should raise the age to 14,” Bennett said. “But we should do a lot of things in a perfect world and, unfortunately, it is not perfect.” The member for Burnett, which centres on Bundaberg, said the issue of youth crime was emotive and “super complex”, admitting that youth detention was not working. “But we’re on a treadmill here and it’s going around and around and we can’t just jump off and raise the age and think it’s gonna fix everything,” Bennett said. “Kids as young as 10 or even younger are committing horrendous crimes in our communities. “So until we can get to the background and the other issues of law and order, particularly with youth, we [the LNP] weren’t going to support it. “It’s cart before the horse.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app The Greens MP Michael Berkman, who introduced the bill and wrote the dissenting report on the committee, described Bennett’s reasoning as “rubbish”. “The argument that we can’t raise the age until we’ve got all those supports in place is rubbish and is completely disingenuous,” Berkman said. “We know what works. The services exist to provide these supports, they are just not adequately funded.” The member for Maiwar said the evidence was clear that a targeted, therapeutic response would help troubled lead “rewarding and constructive lives”, not let them off the hook. “No one is suggesting that we just go easy on kids who are behaving poorly,” Berkman said. “The point is that we need to shift away from criminal responses that we know just make these kids’ lives harder and make their behaviour worse.” Berkman called on the premier to show leadership, saying the Queensland government was using the committee as a “fig leaf” while it pushed the issue “into the never never”. “The committee’s report is a symptom of a completely busted and dysfunctional committee system,” he said. “On an issue like this, there is no justification for the government to persist with its policy position. “But what the government will do is hold up this committee report as though it provides some veneer of justification, when there is none.”",News/Australia news,Aboriginal-led coalition angered over Queensland’s failure to raise age of criminal responsibility ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/aboriginal-led-coalition-angered-over-queenslands-failure-to-raise-age-of-criminal-responsibility
4/5/2022,"The Queensland government has rejected a coal exploration licence north of Bundaberg, in an area of prime farmland and near a marine breeding ground for the southern Great Barrier Reef. The move was welcomed by the region’s Liberal National party MP for Burnett, Stephen Bennett, who called on the mining department to go further and “kill off” the prospect of mining exploration in environmentally and agriculturally sensitive areas. Bundaberg’s mayor, former LNP minister Jack Dempsey, and anti-coal activists also welcomed Tuesday’s decision and said it should not have taken so long to reject the proposal. Speaking from Bundaberg, Labor’s resources minister, Scott Stewart, said he was refusing Fox Resources’ mining development licence, MDL3040, on the grounds of ​​public interest. “There is significant adverse community sentiment about this mineral development licence,” Stewart said. “This is particularly in relation to the potential negative environmental, agricultural and social impacts in the Bundaberg region.” The licence would have allowed Fox Resources to explore for minerals within a certain area, with a further application being required before any mining could be permitted. Stewart said the Palaszczuk government was a supporter of the resources industry, which he said created jobs and generated royalties that “fund teachers, nurses and police officers”. But Stewart said each resources project was assessed “on its own merits” and Fox’s proposal had drawn concerns from the community, Bundaberg Regional Council and members of parliament. Bennett, the local MP, went further, telling Guardian Australia the proposal had brought “huge fear and apprehension” for two years in an area famed for its macadamias, sweet potato and sugar cane farms. Bennett said it had been a “long fight” and thanked the “community champions” who stood up to “big coal with deep pockets”. “I’m on the record as saying: ‘Over my dead body would there ever be a coalmine in north Bundaberg’,” he said. Though the LNP member said he “overwhelmingly welcomed” the state government’s decision, he was “surprised” it had been considered at all. He said a coalmine in the area “would have been a disaster, not only for the environment but also for high-value irrigated agriculture.” “It just beggars belief that they ever would have had a mining tenement capacity for that part of Queensland.” Fox Resources was contacted for comment. The company has previously said any exploration of the area would involve drilling, with the holes being “the same as standard water bore exploration holes’ – which would then be “fully rehabilitated”. “If a mining lease is applied for in the future all environmental issues will be addressed at that time,” the company said in 2021. Bennett said he “100% supported” mining where appropriate, but called on the government to be “proactive” against future exploration in other areas where it was not. “I would think the role of the mining department now would be to go through and find these tenements that are in such environmentally sensitive areas and kill ‘em off now, before someone applies for another MDL,” he said. Dempsey, the mayor of Bundaberg, said his constituents would be “overjoyed” by the decision. The former LNP minister has been a vocal opponent of the coal proposal, which his council has formally opposed. Last month Dempsey hit out at the federal government as being “obsessed with coal”, which he said was out of step with his electorate. On Tuesday, he said the state government’s decision would cement the Bundaberg’s reputation as “a clean, green, quality place”. “The whole of the regional community is relieved,” he said. “It’s just a shame that it has taken so long for this to come to fruition.” Lock the Gate Alliance released a statement welcoming the “final nail in the coffin” of the plan. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Spokesperson Ellie Smith said the “drawn-out saga” was evidence that Queensland needed stricter laws to protect communities, prime agricultural land, and other priority areas from mining. “This victory is testament to the ‘never give up’ attitude of Bundaberg locals, and we warmly congratulate the resources minister on listening to their views,” Smith said. “But this is a battle the community should never have had to fight. “There are some places that are too precious to mine – Fox Resources should never have been allowed to apply to mine in our food bowl just near the Great Barrier Reef.” Smith said a coalmine could have also threatened the “world renowned turtle nesting grounds at Mon Repos”. “Queensland desperately needs to strengthen regional planning laws to prohibit mining in prime farming land and areas of environmental and cultural significance,” she said.",News/Australia news,Queensland government rejects coal exploration licence in farmland close to Great Barrier Reef,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/queensland-government-rejects-coal-exploration-licence-in-farmland-close-to-great-barrier-reef
