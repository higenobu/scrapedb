4/3/2022,"At full-time a deathly hush seemed to descend over Ibrox: the realisation that a season’s efforts had come to nothing, that the title they spent a decade craving and coveting and finally claiming has now all but slipped from their grasp. For after a performance of extraordinary maturity and resilience in the most hostile of settings, Celtic are six points clear in the Scottish Premiership. And as their 700 fans celebrated in their cramped little corner of Ibrox, they knew as well as anyone that it is game over. Tom Rogic and Cameron Carter-Vickers got the goals, but it was at the other end of the pitch that Celtic really distinguished themselves: endless blocks, endless clearing headers, discipline and cohesion and naturally a little gamesmanship when it was required. Their midfield, written off by many ahead of this game as too slight and technical for a game like this, was a superb second line of defence, never allowing Rangers to take control of the game despite Aaron Ramsey’s third-minute goal. For the blue half of Glasgow, an afternoon of regrets and frustrations. They were poor: lacking in finesse and movement, reduced for large periods of the game to a fusillade of abysmal crosses. The seething and screeching of the crowd hardly helped, paralysing every Rangers player with the sort of extreme stress that makes every decision a struggle. There will probably be a lively debate over whether the absent Alfredo Morelos would have made a difference to a toothless attack. Equally, the 11 on the pitch could have done so much more. And this, ultimately, is the sort of game upon which these players will be judged. John Lundstram, otherwise excellent for Rangers, also gave away the free-kick from which Celtic scored their winning goal, and thus will his derby be remembered. Such is the brutal starkness of the Old Firm. Glasgow on derby day was its usual crock pot of malice and menace, nerves and nonsense. Late on Saturday night three Celtic fans were arrested at Ibrox for attempting to seal shut the turnstiles with expanding foam. A few Rangers fans, meanwhile, spent their evenings letting off fireworks outside the Celtic hotel. But for all the shenanigans off the pitch, the songs you can print and the songs you can’t, it was actually a fairly regular sort of game, with very little of the cartoon physicality you often see in these fixtures. Perhaps that suited Celtic, whose brief would have been to neutralise the Ibrox crowd as quickly as possible and let Rangers stew in their own stress. And in this respect perhaps the turning point of the game came as early as the seventh minute, when Rogic’s equaliser dramatically spiked a Rangers surge that was already threatening to set the terms of the game. Rangers were rampant in those opening minutes under the midday sun, full of energy and promise, scoring early through Ramsey, who for all his early struggles at Ibrox was in the right place at the right time in the right game. Ramsey finished a lovely flowing move started by Calvin Bassey and continued by Ryan Kent, who was Rangers’ best player in the first half before fading in the second. And had Rangers just been able to hold on to their lead, perhaps even kill it off, the afternoon might have a radically different feel to it. Instead, to the sound of stunned silence, Rogic bundled the ball in from Celtic’s first attack after Reo Hatate’s shot had been parried by Allan McGregor. Slowly and by degrees, Celtic got themselves into the game. Rogic would have two more good chances over the next half-hour. Rangers would have more of the ball but looked increasingly indecisive with it, as if they were intuiting the tension of their supporters with every touch. Three minutes before half-time Rangers failed to clear a free-kick from the Celtic left and Lundstram’s attempted clearance went to Carter-Vickers, the centre-half on loan from Tottenham. The start of the second half was delayed as stewards removed shards of glass from a glass bottle thrown at the Celtic goalmouth. It was about as close as any Rangers player would get to Joe Hart’s goal for the rest of the afternoon. Rangers began well but quickly ran out of ideas and puff. Celtic were able to refresh their team from the bench and even occasionally threaten a third: Liel Abada had two good chances. And really the disappointment for Rangers will be that they offered so little in a game that mattered so much. There is still a Scottish Cup to be played for, Europa League glory to pursue, perhaps even the forlorn hope that Celtic might slip up and cough up the seven points Rangers need to overtake them. But on this evidence, Celtic’s 52nd league title feels like a formality.",Sport/Football,Celtic firm favourites to reclaim title after Carter-Vickers’ winner at Rangers,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/03/rangers-celtic-scottish-premiership-match-report
4/3/2022,"Awealth of ideas have been thrown into this colourful exploration of celebrity and public philanthropy, but as a whole the piece lacks clarity. With an energetic cast of three and a clumsy overload of screens, Telethon, by theatre company Talk Show, feels like a work-in-progress. This is an ambitious presentation of a chaotic 24-hour televised charity special (actually performed in 90 minutes). Attempting to unite the public to fight the climate crisis, the event is hosted by three bouncy caricatures of C-listers – YouTuber Kris (Archie Backhouse), CBeebies science presenter Erica (Erin Hutching) and disgraced TV star Jennifer (Katie Lovell). Written and directed by Stu Barker and Clare Dunn, the structure and setup are rife for satire, but the comedy feels limp. The stolid structure veers between pre-recorded segments which rid the piece of urgency, direct addresses to nonexistent cameras, and awkward interactions with us, the sparsely used live studio audience. Dramatic distractions keep getting in the way of the team’s aim to raise £10m to plant a million trees. These hiccups – like the reveal that Jennifer flew to the Maldives to conduct an interview about the climate emergency – grow in absurdity, until the whole night veers entirely off-topic. The thread of the story frequently gets lost like this, and struggles to find its way back. Whenever a contentious idea arises, the script reflects on it immediately. One of the fundraising activities involves a volunteer singing the comments that are flooding in online, many of which focus on Jennifer’s relationship drama rather than the night’s cause. By making inane Twitter-spats the primary form of discussion, any real sense of debate is dulled. The show becomes far less about the hypocrisy of humanity in the face of catastrophe, and far more about memes and the personal drama of worn-out celebrity. The team’s integrated access works well, with captions and occasional BSL naturally slotted into the story. But the messy text lacks cohesion and progression, and the result is just confusing. Though funny moments are interspersed throughout, little is driving us forwards other than the desire – one felt by the hosts as well as the audience – to get to the end of the 24 hours.

4/3/2022,"In Sumirago, a suburb of Varese in Lombardy, where the verdant surrounds sit in the shadow of the famously pastel-tinted Monte Rosa, Rosita Missoni is describing the scene outside her window. “It really is a beautiful day, the sky is a bright blue and the mountain is white,” she says. “It’s why we came here originally, because of this fabulous view – and why my husband insisted on big windows everywhere.” Situated 25 miles northwest of Milan, the area is the spiritual home of Missoni, the Italian fashion house famous for its joyful zig-zag knits. Rosita established Missoni with her late husband Ottavio in 1953, and it grew into one of Italy’s most recognisable and celebrated exports. Finding a tranquil spot like this, where they could nurture their business and their young family away from the urban bustle, was the most important priority for the couple. “Generally at the time, everyone was going nearer to Milan and big cities, but we wanted to have nature around us,” Rosita explains. “It was 1970 and things were going very well for us at the time and so we decided to build our own factory. My husband started asking around to see if there were places where we could get some nice space and when I came here, I was totally in love with what he had found. My husband and I had a very optimistic view of life in that moment, we were very happy and this became the place of our lives.” If there is one word to describe the Missoni aesthetic and dynasty, it would be optimism. Aside from the jubilant colour palettes and invigorating prints for which it is famed, the family’s close-knit bond and zest for life is legendary. If they’re not travelling the world together, they are hosting candlelit fashion-week parties for hundreds of guests and publishing family cookbooks to share their favourite recipes. Fifty years on from building their forever home, the magnetism of the mountain town has kept Rosita’s family close by. Her children, Angela and Luca – who both held senior roles at the fashion brand until last year – along with their children and grandchildren all live within 10 minutes’ drive and pop in regularly to share meals. “This is an open house!” she laughs. “Everybody is welcome here.” This sense of celebration permeates Rosita’s home, which is like her three-dimensional autobiography, or a family photo album come to life, each corner featuring a memento, a sculpture, a book or a trinket that transports her back to a specific time and place. “My home is my nest,” she says. A large open-plan space, white walls and terracotta floors act as canvases for Missoni Home textiles, for which 90-year-old Rosita continues to serve as creative director. There are hundreds of treasures on display: Rosita says there are no rules as to what makes it in here, “I just have to like it.” Many of the huge pieces of art were collected by the couple as gifts to one another before Ottavio died in 2013. Rosita points to a large 1953 picture, entitled Composition, by the Italian painter Tancredi, in her living room, which she bought her husband for his 80th birthday. “It reminded me of his fabric patterns and colour swatches,” she says. In her bedroom, illustrations by Sonia Delaunay, which she has collected over the years, fill the walls, while a huge floral oil-painting by the French artist Jacques Henri Lartigue, better known for his photography, hangs above her bed. “That’s something I bought in Paris. It was quite expensive, but at that time I decided I could offer myself this painting,” she explains. Elsewhere, in her snug, where she enjoys her life-long passion of watching sports – she and her husband met at the 1948 London Olympics where he was competing in the 400m hurdles – huge family portraits sit above a sumptuous sofa covered in her signature Missoni Home Neuss pattern. The same fabric is used on all her seating. Does she think the ongoing popularity of her homewares line is a result of it being so feelgood and happy? “Exactly, that’s it,” she says. A flea-market addict – something she delights in having passed down to her daughter and granddaughters – Rosita can regularly be found seeking out objects wherever she may be to satisfy her appetite for a curiosity to bring home. “I never know what’s going to come into my life. It could be a table, a piece of fabric. I walk quite quickly, but when something catches my eye…” The cabinet of ceramics by Susie Cooper and Clarice Cliff in her living room is the culmination of one of her oldest thrifting collections. “I started collecting these when they were quite inexpensive, from markets in London,” she says. “At the time I didn’t have money to spend, but I was an early collector. I went for inspiration for my work and my home and these were very inspiring.” The collector in Rosita shows no sign of slowing down. When we speak, she has just returned home from a trip to Egypt with daughter Angela where, after a cruise on the Nile, the pair swept up souvenirs. “Our luggage was so overweight because I came back with so much,” she says. “I have to decide where I want them around, but I want everything on display.” The warmth and personality of her home, says Rosita, is all in the mix. “I love things that remind me of trips,” she says, still smiling. “I have had the privilege of living a long life and I take great pleasure in sharing our home.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Inside the joyful Lombardy home of Rosita Missoni

4/3/2022,"What happens to the soil under heavily concreted environments such as central London? Is it still full of worms and is the soil still rich in nutrients and life? Alison Givney Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com. What most people think of as soil exists only near the ground surface and has terrible engineering properties: whatever gets built on top settles unevenly and rain ingress can lead to swelling and erosion. So all the organic stuff containing the worms and dead leaves tends to be excavated, leaving firmer soil below to build structures on. Sadly, removing all that soil organic matter is taking quite a toll ecologically and environmentally (globally, soil is our No 2 carbon sink, after the oceans) so we need to be doing more to ensure we always return the nutrients to the earth. Ted O’Hare If you look at the challenges faced by urban street trees, that’s probably an indication of the soil quality under heavily concreted areas. City trees grow in soil that is very depleted in nutrients due to a lack of top soil and organic matter from fallen leaves and other plant and animal debris; the soil will be much more compacted and less aerated, and surrounding surfaces are largely impermeable to oxygen and rainwater, which is also likely to be more polluted. Urban areas also act as heat islands increasing moisture evaporation. Consequently urban trees have a much shorter lifespan than suburban or rural trees, reflected by the soil quality. MrsLessing Before the concrete is laid, any topsoil will be stripped off and removed, so this will automatically remove most of the soil microbe population, the seed bank, important nutrients such as nitrogen and sulphur, plus a good proportion of other mineral nutrients and trace elements. What’s left is the subsoil – or historically made ground if it was a brownfield site – which is typically inert, inorganic and impoverished. So, initially, the answer to these specific questions is: no, it is lifeless. However, over time, concrete cracks, which reconnects the soil to the surface and atmosphere, and the weathering forces that are partly responsible for soil creation in the first place. Trees also extend their roots under the concrete/hard surfacing, causing further cracking but also sub-surface connections to the surface. Underground services, such as drainage pipework also crack and break, further enhancing the influence of air and water. These connections allow micro, meso and even macro fauna (including earthworms) to re-colonise the parts of the soil profile where growing conditions start to become favourable. This is usually still only a small proportion of the total area, but it is a start. So, I would say that over time, some life will return to the soil beneath concrete and other hardstanding. Tim O’Hare, Sustainable Soils Alliance We had a mid-40s house in California (ancient by CA standards) with a heavily concreted back yard. It took us about four weekends to pull up and dispose of the concrete and we thought that it would take several years to regenerate the soil. But the newly uncovered ground proved incredibly fertile and within a year we had tomato plants taller than 6ft. So I guess that there was a great deal of biological activity that must have been taking place underneath the concrete. Presumably water and air could get through the cracks in the concrete? Robert Cripps There is no viable soil symbiotic interactions under either concrete or asphalt. Basically cut off from both the atmosphere and water, there is no activation of the beneficial microbes, or nutrients. Therefore no bugs, except ants and possibly a few others will benefit from existing in a non-viable environment cut off from oxygen and water. Robin Lloyd I recently picked up two tonnes of top soil that was underneath a demolished garage – there’s no worms in it and nothing has randomly started to grow in it over the last week. Powers I can’t speak for heavily concreted, but early last summer in our garden we removed a thick layer of gravel with multi-layered weed suppressant underneath it, which had been there for many years. There was not a sign of life in the soil underneath, certainly no worms, and I fretted about bringing in some top soil as it felt so dead. Needn’t have worried, as all of that quickly came back once open to the elements. We’ve added localised compost when planting certain plants, but for a wildlife garden, the initially nutrient-poor soil has been something of a bonus, as it tends to suit many native wildflowers. drizzleinthebrizzle Soil needs the activity of insects, fungi, bacteria and birds/mammals in order to maintain the richness and life within it. Soil is built from the actions of different organisms, each contributing towards it in some way. When you cover it, or pave over it, or even dig it up (to some degree), you inadvertently change its structure and the way it functions. This is why no-till gardening/farming is making a comeback. We need to start recognising widely the importance of soil and begin to address how to improve it (for the benefit of all organisms) instead of stripping it bare. Apfreely If you’re going to build something, it doesn’t matter what, and there is going to be concrete laid, all topsoil and organic matter have to be removed. That means underneath your road, house foundation, terrace, shed base etc, there’s just compacted subsoil. Sorry, no worms, creepy-crawlies or other interesting creatures, and no vegetation. Inert, and stable – or it should be, otherwise you’ll have the district surveyor on your neck. At least it used to be when I was laying bricks in southern England. Hard to say, though, these days anything is possible – they might have sold the quality control to a consortium of California hairdressers, or a private equity gorilla, who knows? bricklayersoption I’m a geologist. Analysis of buried soils under the permafrost layer in Siberia show quite bioactive soil horizons, and the research found that the buried soil was higher in microbial life than the soil horizons above it that were exposed to air and falling vegetative matter. In soil horizons you have lateral and vertical permeation of water and gas; the water table in London for example, is about 45 metres below the surface. When I studied geo-tech, it’s vertical structures and pumping that has more local influence on the water table’s hydrological movement than capping from rainwater. You would still get water and gas diffusion, as anyone digging a building foundation in London could attest. So I would say though you would get a strong reduction in insect and arthropod and possibly worms and any other creature that needs occasional surface access, the microbial and fungal life is much more dependent on what was there originally, the soil profile, than any capping. Was it a black humus rich in organic matter, or one of the famous London clay formations outcropping at the surface? Both would be richer in microbial life even capped by concrete, than would an exposed laterite soil of Western Australia. A lecturer told me: “It takes a million years to make a good soil.” He was referring to the loss of top soil from poor land use, the fact that it takes so long (like a lot of geological processes; oil can take 10m years to mature) and can be gone so quickly. But it also means that a concrete cap of 20 years or even 300 makes little difference to the soil. It’s just a hiatus in the addition of organic material in the very uppermost layer, and some of the organisms that are involved in exploiting this. This isn’t an argument that urban sprawl isn’t environmentally damaging – it clearly is – just that when you go a few feet down there’s less influence from what’s happening on the surface. WombatsRamble Sorry – as a soil scientist I think you are off the mark here. Under a single paving slab there is probably very little impact on the soil beneath – indeed it may create additional habitat. Lift up a single slap and there are lots of worms and other creatures making use of the space. However, concrete over an area the size of Heathrow runway 3 and this will have a dramatic impact on the gaseous and hydrological status of the soil, eliminating all macrofauna and dramatically altering the microfauna into anaerobic-tolerant species. Yes, it’s life Jim, but not as we know it. FishSocks When I took on an allotment 10 years ago, it was covered by a double layer of carpet, so there was nothing growing there at all, and just like a paved street, the soil was pretty lifeless, no earthworms etc. As the soil health movement’s famous agronomist Ray Archuleta is fond of saying: “Plant and soil are one.” Plants make soil, so without plants and the myriad organisms they support, what do you have? Geology. So concrete is death unless you can break it up with an earthquake or something and start over again. frostfinger4 We bought a vineyard in the south of France that had been subjected to about 30 years of “modern agriculture” involving heavy equipment and some pretty nasty chemicals. The soil was dead, concrete hard with no insects nor birds living there. We quit spraying the nasties and encouraged the natural weeds to grow. It took about seven years for the soils to regenerate, mostly through common sense and benign neglect. Interestingly, several years into this project, the ag-advisory people became very concerned about the degraded soils locally and persuaded a bunch of vignerons to dig two-metre pits in various places. They then gathered us up and we went around inspecting each other’s soil. Alarmingly, every single pit uncovered soils that were remineralising – turning back into rock! Except the two on our domaine, which made the ag advisers very happy. It also had the effect of finally stopping all the other vignerons from laughing at us for all the weeds in our vineyard. I guess the moral here is that even dead, seemingly inert soils (as you would expect to find under concrete) can regenerate if you just leave them alone. winebore I lived in a 15-year-old house with a near solid concrete pad (14ft wide) as a patio in the back yard. Our neighbours made the mistake of planting a willow tree 6ft from the fence; its roots were able to send out runners that went more than 25ft underground before coming up in our yard. The extension service told me willow roots could travel over 50ft under concrete from the host tree. water_moon It sits and contemplates the question which most of nature asks itself on a daily basis: why are humans so stupid? _Meat_ Humans being an important part of nature, your question should really be: “Why is nature so stupid?” Unless, of course, you’re actually saying that humans aren’t a part of the natural order?

4/3/2022,"Lawyers are expecting a surge in applications from separating couples when no-fault divorce is introduced in England and Wales on Wednesday. In what has been described as the biggest reform of divorce laws for 50 years, couples will not have to either separate for at least two years – increasing to five if one party does not consent – or allocate blame to legally end their marriage. Last Thursday was the final day for couples to divorce under the existing system and solicitors said, even before then, many delayed in anticipation of the new law. Jo Edwards, the head of family law at Forsters, said: “My experience and the experience of loads of practitioners I’ve spoken to is that once we’ve said to people, certainly over the last three or four months and in some instances earlier than that, that there was this new law coming in – because we’ve known for a few months it will be 6 April – generally the preference has been to wait for the no-fault based system. “The experience of other countries where they’ve moved to a no-fault system, is that there is a spike when the new law comes in – in Scotland, for example, when they changed the law in 2006.” Ed Floyd, a specialist family lawyer and partner at Farrer & Co, said: “There is a lot of pent-up demand. We’ve been seeing clients for a number of months that although they’ve agreed to separate, can’t face the blame game. It [no-fault divorce] is something that’s got a lot of public cut-through”. The latest divorce statistics, published on Thursday, showed that the number of divorce petitions in the last quarter of 2021 was down 26% on the same period in 2020. There are fears that an initial surge in cases coupled with the new technology necessary to implement no-fault divorce will put added pressure on courts that Floyd said “have never been under greater strain because of because of Covid and budget cuts”. However, Edwards said that in the medium to longer term the reform would be likely to reduce the burden on courts because they would require less judicial oversight as there would be no grounds for a spouse to contest the divorce. Stowe Family Law is also anticipating a spike in the number of couples seeking divorce, although Amanda Phillips-Wylds, a managing partner at the firm, said others had been rushing to push through a divorce under the existing fault-based system. She suggested couples were motivated by “catharsis”, but also because some “wrongly believe that being able to prove the other party was at fault for the marital breakdown would favourably impact their financial settlement and arrangements for any children … In reality, behaviour very rarely impacts financial outcomes or arrangements for children.” Lawyers were at pains to point out that the new law would not affect the financial settlement process – which is separate – nor necessarily speed up the divorce. For the first time there will be a new minimum overall timeframe of six months for the divorce. Edwards said she supported this in principle to allow time for reflection, but added: “I do have some concerns about that because in a coercive controlling relationship there’ll be nothing to stop a joint applicant from withdrawing partway through the process, and then you start all over again.” The government has said it would look at the financial settlement process, in which judges currently have broad discretion, and it is also being urged by bodies including Family Solutions group to look at ways of taking divorcing couples away from the courts altogether to put the welfare of children centre stage. “Now that no-fault divorce is coming in I think it’s recognised in government that this can’t be the end of it,” said Edwards. “There needs to be other things that should be looked at.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,No-faults divorce: rush expected as new law introduced in England and Wales,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/03/no-faults-divorce-rush-expected-as-new-law-introduced-in-england-and-wales
4/3/2022,"Rishi Sunak should be used to grim economic forecasts. In his two years as chancellor, he’s been warned to brace for the worst jobs crisis since the 1980s, a recession without parallel for three centuries, and the biggest shock to the public finances since the second world war. Not everything came to pass. Extending furlough – rather than ending it early as the chancellor planned – prevented unemployment from hitting levels unseen since the days of his political idol Nigel Lawson. Nonetheless, the chancellor is said to have taken issue with the Office for Budget Responsibility for overshadowing his spring statement with dire economic forecasts. Anonymous sources told the Times that Sunak “absolutely viscerally hates the OBR”, saying the Treasury forecaster had made unidentified “normative policy judgements” – expressing an opinion about the way things ought to be, rather than impartially describing the outlook for the economy and public finances. Sources close to Sunak have downplayed the leak, suggesting there is no truth to the anonymous briefing. Yet it would fit with a pattern. Leaks to another friendly newspaper suggested the chancellor was frustrated with the BBC. Far from the image of the smooth operator of his early months in the job, brand Sunak’s gloss appears to be wearing thin. There are good reasons why the tide is turning. None of those are because impartial bodies are putting an ideological spin on things. Unfortunately for the chancellor, the facts speak for themselves. The independent Treasury economics forecaster had told the public Britain was heading for the biggest annual fall in living standards since the mid-1950s, while Sunak was far from the tax cutter he proclaimed. His spring statement peroration promised the biggest net cut to personal taxes in over a quarter of a century. The OBR verdict, however, was clear: the tax burden would rise, not fall, to the highest level since Clement Attlee was prime minister in the late 1940s. At worst, these statements could be accused of being a bit too colourful for an impartial body. Richard Hughes, the chair of the OBR, is said by those who know him to be keen on such factoids, ensuring they are peppered through the forecasts perhaps more readily than his predecessor, Robert Chote. However, these gobbets remain far from normative. Such terms might grab media attention and risk upstaging the chancellor. Yet clear and relatable communication is vital for conveying knotty economic matters for a broad audience. To err on the side of caution for the fragile ego of a chancellor would be folly. Even so, it doesn’t take a colourful OBR report to know the economic outlook is unremittingly bleak, as the inevitable consequence of a once in a century pandemic is followed by war in Europe for the first time in decades. Faced with the intense squeeze on living standards, a chorus line of charities and thinktanks have warned poverty is set to surge and questioned the chancellor’s resolve to do his utmost to help those most at risk. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, warned last week that the poorest in society would suffer most from the worst inflation shock since the 1970s. Yet intervening in the economy to affect distributional outcomes is not in the Bank’s remit. The verdict from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Resolution Foundation could hardly be clearer: Sunak has unique powers to cushion families from the cost of living crisis, yet chose to prioritise pre-election tax cuts for tomorrow ahead of addressing problems today. If Sunak was keeping tabs on those overshadowing him by pointing this out, he would make a very long list indeed. Without passing judgement on the desirability of his actions, the OBR said Sunak had offset only a third of the overall fall in living standards. It also said the chancellor still had £30bn of fiscal firepower left in the tank. It doesn’t take a Treasury watchdog to know more could have been done. Besides, Boris Johnson told the public just as much – admitting less than 24 hours after the spring statement that further action was warranted. In Sunak’s defence, the watchdog warned relatively small changes to the economic outlook could wipe out this headroom within self-imposed limits for the public finances. Debt interest costs are set to surge to a record £83bn next year – making it the fourth largest item of public spending after the NHS, state pension and eduction. It was here the chancellor perhaps wanted the public’s attention focused, in keeping with the spirit of the OBR’s creation by George Osborne as a form of straitjacket for government finances. Set up as a police officer for ensuring deficit reduction stuck to its course in 2010, the OBR – suitably based in the Ministry of Justice just a short walk from the Treasury – was planned as a way to show Osborne was serious about balancing the books. Some were cynical about its foundation. One senior policymaker said it was seen more as a gimmick at first, believing the Tories wanted their own equivalent of Labour granting the Bank of England operational independence in 1997. It has faced criticism for being subject to political influence in the past, including under Sunak as recently as last year, when it was alleged to have used out-of-date economic forecasts at his request. The times have however changed, both for the OBR and our collective economic priorities. It has grown into a vital authority on the economy, publishing clear reports when the Treasury might seek to bury bad news. Concerns today are less focused on risks to the public finances and more on outcomes for public wellbeing. “We are, frankly, never going to be Greece,” one senior policymaker told me. As the National Institute for Economic and Social Research has argued, Britain should design a new fiscal framework to get away from a “budgetarian” approach that sees tax and spending decisions through the lens of arbitrary targets, set to arbitrary dates coincidental with elections. In a world where too much government policy operates by the smoke and mirrors of political surprise and partial leak, the OBR is an important check and balance.",News/Politics,Sunak pours scorn on the OBR’s dire warnings – but the facts speak for themelves,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/03/sunak-pours-scorn-on-the-obrs-dire-warnings-but-the-facts-speak-for-themelves
4/3/2022,"The National Gallery has altered the title of Edgar Degas’ drawing Russian Dancers to Ukrainian Dancers”, prompting calls for other cultural institutions to rethink “lazy” interpretations or mislabelling of Ukrainian art and heritage. After calls by Ukrainians on social media, the gallery said it had changed the title of the French impressionist’s turn-of-the-20th-century work, which is currently not on display. It is a pastel depicting troupes of dancers, which the artist was fascinated to see performing in Paris late in his life. The yellow and blue of Ukraine’s national colours are noticeable in what appear to be hair ribbons worn by the dancers and in garlands they are carrying. A spokesperson for the National Gallery said: “The title of this painting has been an ongoing point of discussion for many years and is covered in scholarly literature; however there has been increased focus on it over the past month due to the current situation so therefore we felt it was an appropriate moment to update the painting’s title to better reflect the subject of the painting.” A few weeks ago, a member of the gallery’s education department had highlighted the issue, while a Ukrainian living in London had also used Instagram to do so. Among those welcoming the National Gallery’s move was Mariia Kashchenko, the Ukrainian-born founder and director of Art Unit, which showcases emerging artists, including 21 Ukrainian artists at the moment. “I understand that the term Russian art became an easy umbrella term which was useful but it’s really important now to get things right. As a Ukrainian person, in the past I would have encountered times when I was called Russian, or where Ukrainian heritage was described as Russian,” she said. Criticism of UK cultural institutions has also come from Olesya Khromeychuk, the director of the Ukrainian Institute in London, who wrote last month in the German magazine Der Spiegel: “Every trip to a gallery or museum in London with exhibits on art or cinema from the USSR reveals deliberate or just lazy misinterpretation of the region as one endless Russia; much like the current president of the Russian Federation would like to see it. “The curators have no problem presenting Jewish, Belarusian or Ukrainian art and artists as Russian. On a rare occasion when a Ukrainian is not presented as Russian, he or she might be presented as ‘Ukrainian-born’, as was the case with the film director, Oleksandr Dovzhenko, in one of the major exhibitions on revolutionary art in London.” The National Gallery told the Guardian research that was continuing about paintings in its collection and information about its works was updated as and when appropriate and when new information came to light. A National Portrait Gallery spokesperson said the gallery was closed while it underwent a major transformation, but as part of its Inspiring People project was reviewing the interpretation of every work that will be on display in time for when it reopens next year. Referring to the action taken in relation to the Degas work, the spokesperson added: “We are also very open to receiving feedback from the public about specific works and regularly respond to comments shared by our audiences, including those made on social media.”  ",Arts/Art and design,National Gallery renames Degas’ Russian Dancers as Ukrainian Dancers,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/03/national-gallery-renames-degas-russian-dancers-as-ukrainian-dancers
