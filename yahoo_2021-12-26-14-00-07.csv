Police prevented the bomber from entering the building, but he blew himself up at the entrance killing himself and five other people. Another 13 people were injured.

The museum this month dressed the likeness of the singer in a Christmas outfit, but it wasn’t the seasonal attire that got every’s attention. It was the statue’s poor resemblance to the nine-time Grammy winner. “Rihanna Wax Figure Apparently Made By Someone Who’s Never Seen Rihanna,” blared one headline. The fan response on Twitter also declared the exhibit to be in a hopeless place. “That wax figure of Rihanna is a hate crime,” one person tweeted.
