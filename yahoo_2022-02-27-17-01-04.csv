2/27/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Commodities are heading for a manic start to the week as investors scramble to assess how the West’s latest sanctions on Russia -- and an intensifying war in Ukraine -- will affect flows of energy, metals and crops. Most Read from Bloomberg U.S., Europe Cut Some Russian Banks From SWIFT: Ukraine Update Musk Activates Starlink Satellites in Response to Ukraine Plea Putin Ramps Up Ukraine Invasion Pronouncing Peace Talks Dead U.S., EU Cut Some Russian Banks From SWIFT, Target Central Bank China Distances Itself From Russia, Calls for Halt to Violence Western nations agreed to sweeping new curbs that will penalize Russia’s central bank and exclude some others from the SWIFT messaging system, used for trillions of dollars worth of transactions around the world. One White House official said the administration is looking to exempt energy sector transactions from the latter measure. Click here for rolling update on the conflict in Ukraine The announcements from the European Union and the U.S. are another dramatic escalation in a conflict that’s roiling raw materials through supply snarl-ups and the prospect of profound shifts in the geopolitical landscape. Oil breached $100 a barrel last week, aluminum hit a record high, and grain prices surged. The attack on Ukraine is Europe’s biggest crisis since World War Two, and a major threat to the continent’s energy security. The jump in prices of commodities -- Bloomberg’s gauge hit a record -- will add to inflationary pressures, so expect more talk of demand destruction and economic damage. Here are five things to look for in the coming week. What’s Next for Oil? The coming days are fraught with event risk for crude, even aside from the sanctions fallout. There’s a midweek meeting of OPEC+ on output; the Biden administration may tap stockpiles; and Iranian nuclear talks look to be nearing a conclusion. On top of that, American crude inventories at the key Cushing hub could sink to the lowest since 2014 if there’s another modest draw. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said that despite the rally in prices, it’s unlikely OPEC+ will choose to quicken the pace at which the alliance has been restoring supplies, citing Russia’s “essential role” in the grouping. Both the OPEC+ meeting on Wednesday, and the latest government snapshot of U.S. crude holdings and demand the same day, will be covered by Top Live blogs. Europe’s Energy Crisis Europe gets more than a third of its gas supply from Russia, and big price spikes in the aftermath of Russia’s attack testified to jitters around what the immediate future will bring. Conflict in the east comes with the continent already facing spiraling energy costs. Even as Moscow’s forces pushed further into Ukraine, Europe’s top energy companies were hurrying to buy more Russian gas. The gas market will become “even rockier” in the aftermath of Vladimir Putin’s aggression, according to BloombergNEF. While Russia is unlikely to choke off supplies to Europe for a prolonged period, it’s something that can’t be ruled out -- especially if sanctions are ratcheted up. Yellow Haven In the immediate aftermath of Russia’s invasion, investors rushed to bullion in a flight from geopolitical tumult and economic risks. The precious metal hit a 17-month high before retreating as the first batch of Western sanctions on Russia were viewed as underwhelming. This might make gold a good early gauge on Monday of how markets see the latest measures. Gold Extends Drop as Traders Weigh Ukraine War, U.S. Sanctions On the one hand, there’s an argument that the addition of a European war to soaring commodity prices is a recipe for a wider growth slowdown. If that happens, the recent flow of ETF investment to gold -- even before Thursday’s escalation -- might become a rising tide, helping to boost prices. However, there’s also a school of thought that bullion will fall back to earth once the dust settles and investors go back to focusing on rising U.S. interest rates. Upsetting the Breadbasket Global inflation could hit an all-time high when the United Nations comes out with its latest monthly snapshot on Thursday. Consumers are already grappling with soaring food costs after drought and labor shortages slashed harvests around the world at a time of rising demand. Now prices of grains and cooking oils have taken another powerful leap upward following the invasion of Ukraine, a country that’s been labeled the breadbasket of Europe. See also: ‘The Sky’s the Limit’: Food Inflation to Worsen on Ukraine Wheat jumped to a 13-year high, raising bread costs, while soybean oil and palm oil, used in everything from chocolate to instant noodles, surged to records. Corn and soybeans also rallied. Ukraine’s fertile soils have made it the second-largest global grain shipper and a major sunflower oil exporter. But the invasion is shuttering ports and railways, leaving traders struggling to book vessels. Russia is also a top supplier of wheat and sunflower oil. Metals Mayhem? Investors will be waiting to see how the latest sanctions affect trade in metals like aluminum, nickel and palladium where Russia is a major producer. Just as in energy, the U.S. seemed unwilling for now to directly disrupt Russian supplies. That could be a lesson learned from 2018, when curbs on Russia’s top aluminum producer sparked months of market chaos. Consequently, the metal’s surge to a record lost some momentum on Friday. Even without direct sanctions on producers, there will still be an impact from the financial restrictions that have been announced. There’s already signs that banking curbs are scaring buyers and trade financiers away from Russian businesses. That could snarl supply chains and fuel more volatility. And with aluminum tight as it is, don’t rule out new records -- or even a march toward $4,000 a ton.

2/27/2022,"The US and Europe are turning to economic sanctions in an effort to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine without tempting nuclear war. One sticking point has been SWIFT, the 48 year-old Belgian organization that acts as a hub for global money transfers between banks, more formally known as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Telecommunication.

2/27/2022,"Stocks rallied Friday for a second day in a row as traders eyed the latest developments in Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the world's response. The S&P 500 advanced more than 2%, rising further after a 1.5% jump on Thursday. The Dow and Nasdaq also built on Thursday's gains to add more than 1% intraday on Friday. The Dow closed up by more than 800 points, or 2.5%, posting its best day of 2022. The Nasdaq ended higher by more than 200 points, or 1.6%. The move came after new economic data showed U.S. personal spending rose more than expected in January, even accounting for a surge in inflation. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE), a closely watched gauge of inflation, soared by 6.1%, or the fastest rate in 40 years. Stocks moved higher even against the backdrop of Russia's military attack of Ukraine and Western nation's sanctions on Russia. Though equities have been sliding and energy commodity prices soaring in recent sessions as investors considered the financial market impacts of the conflict, markets at least temporarily stabilized in absence of further evidence of U.S. economic damage. ""The market is going to overreact to good news and bad. The news [Thursday] morning was sell, sell, sell,"" Allan Boomer, Momentum Advisors chief investment officer, told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday. ""And now we analyzed the news ... I think what the market has decided is that this Ukraine-Russia [situation] is a tragedy, [but] it's not necessarily a global event that's going to cause us to fall into a deep recession."" ""I think the biggest factor right now is the Fed,"" he added. ""And if anything, this Russian event may make the Fed a bit less hawkish."" And indeed, market participants have now priced in a much lower probability that Federal Reserve officials will front-load their interest rate hiking cycle and raise rates by 50 basis points at the end of their March meeting. The last time the Fed raised rates by more than 25 basis points in one meeting was in 2000. While such a move would serve as an aggressive shift by the Fed to begin actively reining in inflation, it could also further roil financial markets that have already endured increased volatility this year and that have now also been spooked by the specter of further international conflict. ""This has been the second worst start to the year for U.S. equities since 2000. Yet, these moves are not solely (or even mostly) driven by the Russia/Ukraine tensions,"" Seema Shah, Sharing Principal Global Investors chief strategist, wrote in an email. ""Equity declines began in January and were, at least initially, driven by inflation concerns and expectations for significantly sharper central bank tightening."" ""Energy prices had been rising steadily throughout the pandemic recovery and in response to lower-than-expected OPEC+ production. Concerns around Federal Reserve balance sheet reduction caused credit spreads to start to gap out in early January,"" she added. ""The Russia/Ukraine situation is certainly significant—but it has simply compounded these already challenging market conditions."" Other strategists also suggested that U.S. stocks would trade primarily based on the monetary policy and earnings implications of any impacts of the latest geopolitical tensions. ""The U.S. economy has pretty low exposure directly to Ukraine and the situation with Russia. However, the important thing here is, how does it impact inflation expectations? And that's really what we're keeping an eye on,"" Anna S. Han, Wells Fargo Securities equity strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday. ""As inflation becomes a variable for corporates, the potential for it to eat away at earnings, or a potential for it to really steer the Fed to accelerate or decelerate that rate hike cycle — that's what we're looking at."" — Here were the main moves in markets as of 4:00 p.m. ET: S&P 500 (^GSPC): +95.92 (+2.24%) to 4,384.62 Dow (^DJI): +834.72 (+2.51%) to 34,058.55 Nasdaq (^IXIC): +221.04 (+1.64%) to 13,694.62 Crude (CL=F): -$0.60 (-0.65%) to $92.21 a barrel Gold (GC=F): -$34.20 (-1.78%) to $1,892.10 per ounce 10-year Treasury (^TNX): +1.7 bps to yield 1.9860% — Ford (F) said on Friday that it would pause production of its top-selling F-150 pick-up trucks at its Kansas City factory due to the ongoing chip shortage. The automaker is one of many to suspend or pull back on production due to supply chain-related disruptions. In September, General Motors cut production at a number of North American assembly plants due to chip shortages. Earlier this month, Ford had said it expected sales to drop by the single to low-double-digits due to semiconductor shortages. — The three major stock indexes soared Friday midday, looking past geopolitical tensions and instead focusing on a bevy of solid economic data. The S&P 500 jumped by 1.8%, with the financials, healthcare and materials sectors leading the way higher. The Dow added more than 600 points, or nearly 2% as Johnson & Johnson, Merck and Amgen outperformed. The Nasdaq added 1.2%. The risk-on mood extended to Bitcoin, which jumped more than 9% to trade above $39,000. Treasury yields rose slightly, and the benchmark 10-year yield added 0.7 basis points to hover around 1.98%. — Pending home sales posted the largest decline in nearly one year at the start of 2022, with rising interest rates and tight inventory levels weighing on housing market activity. Homes under contract to be sold declined by 5.7% in January compared to December and fell by 9.5% compared to the same month in 2021, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said Friday. The monthly dip was the largest since February 2021, and represented a third straight monthly decline. — Consumer sentiment edged up in late February but still marked the lowest level in a decade, according to the University of Michigan's closely watched monthly index.  The institution's headline index from its Surveys of Consumers was upwardly revised to 62.8 in the final monthly print, up from the 61.7 previously reported. Still, even with the revision, this was the worst reading in about 10 years. In January, the index had stood at 67.2. ""The loss was still entirely due to a 12.9% decline among households with incomes of $100,000 or more,"" Richard Curtin, Surveys of Consumers chief economist, said in a statement. ""The February descent resulted from inflationary declines in personal finances, a near universal awareness of rising interest rates, falling confidence in the government's economic policies, and the most negative long term prospects for the economy in the past decade."" ""The financial harm and growing angst among consumers about rising inflation have pushed nearly nine-in-ten consumers to anticipate interest rate hikes,"" he added. ""The Fed's clinging to the transient hypothesis meant missed opportunities to nip inflation at its earliest stages; aggressive actions are now needed to avoid the potential establishment of an inflationary psychology that acts to form a self-fulfilling prophecy."" — Here's where stocks were trading Friday morning: S&P 500 (^GSPC): +12.35 (+0.29%) to 4,301.05 Dow (^DJI): +174.10 (+0.52%) to 33,397.93 Nasdaq (^IXIC): -10.12 (-0.08%) to 13,464.71 Crude (CL=F): -$0.78 (-0.84%) to $92.03 a barrel Gold (GC=F): -$37.30 (-1.94%) to $1,889.00 per ounce 10-year Treasury (^TNX): +0.9 bps to yield 1.981% — U.S. consumer spending rose at a faster rate than expected in January even adjusting for price increases, suggesting the biggest part of U.S. economic activity was holding up despite persistent inflationary pressures. Personal spending rose at a 2.1% rate in January, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) said Friday. This came in well above the 1.6% jump expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data, and helped reverse a 0.8% monthly drop in spending in December. Real personal spending also exceeded estimates, rising by 1.5% during the month versus the 1.2% increase anticipated. The latest consumer spending data tracked with the Commerce Department's better-than-expected January retail sales report released earlier this month. That report showed a 3.8% rise during the month, or well above the 2% increase expected at the time. BEA data Friday also showed a flat monthly reading on personal income, following a 0.4% rise in income in December. Still, this was better than the 0.3% drop anticipated. — A closely watched measure of inflation soared at the fastest rate in 40 years in January, adding to a bevy of recent data underscoring persistently elevated levels of inflation reverberating throughout the U.S. economy. The Personal Consumptions Expenditures (PCE) index jumped 6.1% in January over last year, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Friday. This represented the fastest rise since 1982, and topped expectations for a 6.0% year-on-year increase, according to Bloomberg consensus data. In December, PCE rose by 5.8% on an annual basis. On a month-over-month basis, the PCE rose 0.6%, matching expectations. Core PCE, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 5.2% over last year in January. This core measure of inflation — and the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge of underlying price trends — also accelerated from the 4.9% annual rate seen in December. And at 5.2%, this marked the fastest increase since 1983. — Here's where stocks were trading ahead of the opening bell: S&P 500 futures (ES=F): -13 points (-0.3%), to 4,272.00 Dow futures (YM=F): -119 points (-0.36%), to 33,037.00 Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): -18.25 points (-0.13%) to 13,948.25 Crude (CL=F): +$0.49 (+0.53%) to $93.30 a barrel Gold (GC=F): -$23.20 (-1.2%) to $1,903.10 per ounce 10-year Treasury (^TNX): +2.3 bps to yield 1.995% — Here were the main moves in markets Tuesday evening: S&P 500 futures (ES=F): -21.5 points (-0.5%), to 4,262.50 Dow futures (YM=F): -145 points (-0.44%), to 33,011.00 Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): -86.75 points (-0.62%) to 13,879.75 — Emily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
