2/14/2022,"In the latest example of midair chaos, a passenger on an American Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., tried to open the aircraft door before being subdued as the plane made an emergency landing. The harrowing scene was chronicled on social media by numerous passengers on Flight 1775—with one posting a video of the pilot confirming that the suspect tried to barge into the cockpit midflight. “He was trying to but he couldn’t get to it,” the pilot told another passenger, in footage of the conversation shared on Twitter. The pilot said the man then attempted to open the plane’s door—which would have been disastrous at that altitude. The incident occurred roughly three hours into the five-hour journey from Los Angeles Airport to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.

There were 5,981 incidents reported in 2021, the worst year on record. Alston told The Daily Beast she was hoping to catch the Super Bowl, but with FBI officials still on the plane and interviewing witnesses as game time neared, she doubted she would make it back home in time. “I should’ve stayed in L.A.,” she said, chuckling.
