2/22/2022,"Reporting conditions for journalists covering the Beijing Winter Olympics fell short of international standards despite assurances from the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the Foreign Correspondents’ Club (FCCC) of China has said. The club said it was “dismayed” that at a time when global attention was trained on China more than ever the government and Olympic officials still failed to uphold their own rules on accredited foreign media. Instead “government interference occurred regularly during the Games”, both inside and outside venues, when journalists tried to interview athletes and local residents.  The FCCC also highlighted significant online trolling and abuse of journalists who had covered Olympic events and related stories. “In some cases these attacks were fuelled by Chinese state media accounts and Chinese diplomats,” it said, describing an observed aspect of state-backed online harassment and propaganda campaigns. The FCCC statement listed a number of claims of intimidation, obstruction and harassment, including some that the IOC – widely criticised for granting the Games to a government accused of crimes against humanity – had dismissed as “isolated incidents”. “After an Olympic ski event, a foreign reporter was prevented by a Beijing Olympic official from interviewing a Hong Kong athlete in the Games’ mixed zone, a space supposedly governed by international Olympic rules,” the statement said. “Most visibly, a reporter with the Dutch national broadcaster NOS was hauled off camera during a live TV broadcast by plainclothes security men, despite the fact that he had been standing in a spot police directed him to only minutes earlier.” During the opening ceremony, the NOS’s Sjoerd den Daas was reporting live from outside the Olympic “bubble” in Beijing when he was grabbed and dragged away by security officials. “Unfortunately, this is increasingly the daily reality for journalists in China,” the Dutch outlet later tweeted, adding that Den Daas “is fine and could fortunately finish his story a few minutes later”. The IOC said it was an “isolated” event that would not affect foreign media reporting at the Games, but the FCCC said foreign reporters were frequently tailed or manhandled by security or officials while trying to report from outside Games venues. A France 24 correspondent said they were assigned a “guide” while reporting from outside the bubble, who reported back if their interviews “deviated” from the official narrative. The FCCC said it was disappointed that China had tightened conditions for the press, “contrary to the Olympic spirit”. It added: “The FCCC urges the Chinese authorities to uphold their own stated rules on accredited foreign press in China: namely, to allow journalists to book and conduct their own interviews without threat of state interference and to report freely in public areas. Unfortunately, neither rule was enforced at a time when global attention was trained on China more than ever.” Press freedom in China has been worsening in recent years, with increasing reports of harassment – online and in person – as well as government-led difficulties. Ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics, the FCCC had accused officials of “continuously stymying” media attempts to cover the preparations and lead up. The Beijing organising committee denied the accusations and said it had “never recognised” the FCCC, but said it “guaranteed the freedom of reporting” by international media on the Games in accordance with “relevant Chinese policies”. The promise was on the proviso journalists abided by “relevant Chinese laws, regulations and anti-epidemic policies”.",Sport/Sport,Journalists’ group ‘dismayed’ by treatment at Beijing Winter Olympics,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/21/journalist-beijing-winter-olympics-foreign-correspondents-club
2/22/2022,"I remember the producer Geoff Anderson and I having a conversation about making a radical version of That’s Life! But instead of bringing dodgy double-glazing salesmen to book, we’d bring down international capitalism. We failed. But we had a really good go.  We piloted Comedy Product in 1995. I was 32 and had done a bit of telly stuff – The Mary Whitehouse Experience, and I’d hosted Loose Talk on Radio 1. But what most obsessed me was The Cutting Edge, a topical weekly comedy show that I’d been part of founding at the Comedy Store. The immediacy coinciding with the strength of the writing would often reflect or refine the audiences’ feeling about a story. Looking back, that was where I began to grind out the daily practice of political comedy. Channel 4 approached us about making the show but the commissioning process took so long. The commissioning editor at the time, Seamus Cassidy, was a great bloke – he was responsible for Father Ted and some other brilliant shows. Trouble was, he took ages to make up his mind. We did a pilot but it was another year before we were up and running. No one had tried to make this kind of show before. We were constantly asking each other, “Can we do this?” In the pilot, we were chasing Lord Bethell in his open-top election battlebus, heckling him with a megaphone, worried that we were going to get arrested. The final thing we did was catch a Finnish arms dealer moving guns around the world illegally. Our exposé led to Finland tightening up their legislation. It was a steep learning curve, from shouting abuse at a Tory MEP to chasing international arms dealers. The standup bits were filmed on a Sunday night before an audience in a south London pub called The Bedford, which used to be on the edge of Balham’s red-light district. Hard to imagine now, with the gentrification that’s happened there. We’d write the script on Friday afternoons. I’d do a couple of warmup gigs on Friday and Saturday night, with the researchers sorting out any problems as we went along. Then, on Sunday, we’d record the show. We made 45 episodes, and Channel 4 gave us a chance to learn on the job. Their lawyers tried to make things work and, on the few occasions they knocked us back, it was executives higher up the food chain on issues of taste and decency. We always shot two shows of the standup with different audiences. In between, we’d get the lawyers’ notes. It gave us space to have fun with it: there was a playful version and the legally required one. Sometimes, I was with the lawyers right up until I stepped back on stage. We had tenacity, an ability to improvise, and sometimes we got lucky. We got Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, CEO of Nestlé, on camera at a time when they were mislabelling their baby milk products in Africa, after a tip-off that he was giving a talk at Oxford University. The college had these great big gates, and a student just let us in. Within two days, he was faxing us new designs for their products with the change of wording. We had scientists, activists and whistleblowers helping us. Someone told us about the radioactive bird shit at Sellafield and we thought: “That can’t be true, can it?” Someone passed us the phone number of Jerry Rawlings, the president of Ghana, and there I was, phoning him on stage from a Balham pub! Some MPs were very open. One just called, I went round to their office and they handed over a load of information about how Britain was refurbishing guns for Morocco in the occupied area of Western Sahara. It became a badge of honour that we were being spied on, a feeling that we were doing something right. After the show finished, I carried on investigating the arms trade and presented evidence to the quadripartite committee [on arms export controls]. I got a call in 2006 from the chairman [Roger Berry MP] who said: “We’ve just published our report and if you look, right at the beginning, it says: ‘We commend the work of Mark Thomas’.” I told him, if you ever say that again, I’ll sue. Channel 4 gave us the money to shoot the very basic pilot, and from there, they commissioned a series and we just got on with it. The biggest motivation was keeping that journalistic integrity – the fear that getting something factually wrong would undermine everything. That drove us. We’re not journalists, we both came from a background in comedy and converted. I made the leap from writing for the likes of The Two Ronnies and Spitting Image to writing and producing for Rory Bremner a few years before. We were constantly performing mental gymnastics because you never had control of all of the elements. We didn’t think we’d get through to Jerry Rawlings, then we had to make sure it was actually him. It was completely absorbing, and the hard work repaid you when you got that extra bit of information or luck. There was no restriction on the subject matter. The format was originally a series of mini-adventures with standup in between, but it later became much more narrative-driven. That was something we grew into, rather than a conscious shift to longer-form storytelling. In the episode about Indonesian clothing factories, where we had schoolchildren interviewing Adidas’s [global director for social and environmental affairs] David Husselbee about the working conditions, we filmed a pre- and post-watershed version, with the former having kids in the audience. And that was the one that went out. After finishing the series, we did a few longer-form episodes for Channel 4’s Dispatches. At that time, [production company] Vera had a third-floor office. And there was a break-in one Sunday afternoon, they smashed their way in with a fire extinguisher, but they didn’t take anything. We put a security guard in, just to keep an eye. And on the next Thursday, at three in the morning, the main door was opened, and a smartly dressed guy came up the stairs. He’d obviously come back for something, and I can only think a bug had been planted. It could have been anyone but we had our suspicions. I used to naively think we were just comedians having fun. But afterwards, I realised they were taking us more seriously than we were [taking ourselves]. I don’t know why Channel 4 haven’t repeated it. We were useful at the time because we allowed them to say they were independent and critical of politicians. But they don’t need that at the moment: they’re fighting a government trying to privatise them. I often think of doing a series called Mark Thomas Déjà Vu, and we’d go back and see who still hasn’t cleaned up their act. Export credit guarantee is still abused, dams are still being built where they shouldn’t. And the arms industry isn’t exactly clean, is it? We were lucky in many ways but we made our own luck. We set out to have fun, doing what we thought an audience would like. Someone once dubbed it “Thomas the Prank Engine”. And I quite like that description.

2/22/2022,"The accidental killing of a hiker by a teenager who was hunting wild boar has rekindled a bitter debate over stricter regulations of France’s hunting tradition ahead of the April presidential election. The 25-year-old woman was walking with a friend along a marked trail near Aurillac in the heavily forested Cantal region when she was hit by a stray bullet on Saturday. She died instantly.  The 17-year-old old girl who pulled the trigger was part of an organised hunt in the forest and had received her hunting licence aged 16. She was treated in hospital for shock and was still being questioned by police on Monday morning. Tests revealed no trace of drugs or alcohol in her body. The killing has sparked a row over hunting accidents in France and whether tough new rules should be imposed limiting hunting to certain days or weekends. France is the country with the largest number of hunters in Europe. It is the only country that allows hunting every day during the hunting season – unlike other countries that have put in place non-hunting days, allowing more security for hikers. “We urgently need more regulation of this activity,” said Yannick Jadot, the Greens presidential candidate. He said an Ipsos poll had shown 61% of French people wanted hunting banned on weekends and in the school holidays. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who is leading in the polls among leftwing candidates, said this “abominable catastrophe must make us stop to think”. He called for a ban on weekends and school holidays “because that’s when there’s the biggest risk”. But he said he did not want to ban hunting completely as that would cause chaos in France. Hunting in France is not considered a class issue, unlike in the UK. The French Revolution stripped nobles of their exclusive hunting rights and today many of France’s more than one million hunters are working class, particularly in the south-west and north-east. Hunting in France varies from wild boar and deer to different bird species. Unlike in the UK, horseback hunting with packs of hounds is not banned, though it is a minority sport. The centrist Emmanuel Macron adopted a pro-hunting stance at the start of his presidency, seen as a way of courting the rural vote. The far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen said hunting in France was “an ancestral tradition which must be maintained”. She said it should not be banned at weekends, but there should be more safety measures to allow walkers and hunters to enjoy the forest. “If it turns out we need to tighten the rules further, we will do so,” Macron’s secretary of state in charge of biodiversity, Bérangère Abba, told Agence France-Presse, noting that France had announced the creation of an app that could indicate areas where hunts were taking place. Le Monde cited figures from France’s biodiversity office of 3,325 hunting accidents in France since 2000, resulting in 421 deaths. France has in recent months banned certain highly criticised hunting techniques of birds, such as hunting with nets or bird cages or glue-trap hunting, in line with a 2009 EU directive.",News/World news,Accidental killing of hiker fuels bitter debate over hunting in France,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/accidental-killing-hiker-wild-boar-hunt-bitter-debate-france
2/22/2022,"Over-75s and people with suppressed immune systems in the UK are to be offered another Covid-19 booster vaccination in the coming weeks to increase potentially waning protection, after advice from the government’s vaccines watchdog. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has formally advised a rollout of an additional booster this spring for groups of people seen as most vulnerable to severe coronavirus.  The recommendation is that additional boosters should be offered to people aged 75 or over, and residents in older people’s care homes, and anyone aged 12 or above who is immunosuppressed. The announcement came justbefore Boris Johnson’s formal unveiling of plans to abolish all domestic coronavirus restrictions across England, including an end to mandatory self-isolation. A decision on the precise plan was delayed at the last minute amid tensions between the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the health secretary, Sajid Javid, over funds for free Covid-19 testing. Groups seen as being at the greatest risk of severe coronavirus are also likely to be offered a further booster jab this autumn, before an expected rise in infections over winter, the JCVI added. It is up to health departments in the four UK nations to decide individually whether to accept the JCVI’s advice. Javid said patients in England would be offered the second booster from about six months after their last dose, and that other nations would do the same. For people with suppressed immune systems, this would be the fifth vaccine jab they have been offered, comprising two boosters as well as three primary jabs. For older people it would be a fourth – two main vaccinations and two boosters. The bulk of the population has been offered three, two vaccinations and one booster. The JCVI statement said many of the oldest people had received their booster in September or October, meaning their immunity could be waning. Prof Wei Shen Lim, who leads on Covid vaccinations for the JCVI, said: “Last year’s booster vaccination programme has so far provided excellent protection against severe Covid-19. To maintain high levels of protection for the most vulnerable individuals in the population, an extra spring dose of vaccine is advised ahead of an expected autumn booster programme later this year. “The JCVI will continue its rolling review of the vaccination programme and the epidemiological situation, particularly in relation to the timing and value of doses for less vulnerable older adults and those in clinical risk groups ahead of autumn 2022.” Boosters are different to the primary Covid vaccinations, in part as they follow two main jabs and are aimed at boosting the protection already offered, and also as they can be smaller doses. Adults in both categories getting a second will be offered 50-microgram doses of the Moderna vaccine, while eligible 12- to 18-year-olds will be offered 30 microgram doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech version. Javid confirmed he had accepted the latest advice. The health secretary said: “We know immunity to Covid-19 begins to wane over time. That’s why we’re offering a spring booster to those people at higher risk of serious Covid-19 to make sure they maintain a high level of protection. It’s important that everyone gets their top-up jabs as soon as they’re eligible. “The JCVI will keep under review whether the booster programme should be extended to further at-risk groups.” The decision comes five days after Javid accepted separate JCVI advice for children aged five to 11 in England to be offered a vaccine, while emphasising that parents would be expected to make their own decision. Daniel Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London said the recommendation was “a good safety measure for the more vulnerable”, adding that such schemes needed to be properly gauged for effectiveness. “In an ideal world, any advice of this type needs to remain firmly tethered to ongoing monitoring programmes of caseload and immunity – otherwise we’re just operating on guesswork,” he said. Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick, agreed. “It makes sense to continue to protect the most vulnerable – particularly if the requirement for self-isolation is removed and testing is going to become more limited,” he said. “We know that the elderly and most vulnerable are more susceptible to infection and can mount poor immune response to vaccination. So it makes sense to protect against future variants and to provide longer-lived immune responses for these individuals.”",News/Society,UK: over-75s and vulnerable people to be offered additional Covid booster jab,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/21/uk-older-vulnerable-people-to-be-offered-covid-booster-vaccine
2/22/2022,"The fallout from a huge leak of Credit Suisse banking data threatened to damage Switzerland’s entire financial sector on Monday after the European parliament’s main political grouping raised the prospect of adding the country to a money-laundering blacklist. The European People’s party (EPP), the largest political grouping of the European parliament, called for the EU to review its relationship with Switzerland and consider whether it should be added to its list of countries associated with a high risk of financial crime.  Experts said that such a move would be a disaster for Switzerland’s financial sector, which would face the kind of enhanced due diligence applied to transactions linked to rogue nations including Iran, Myanmar, Syria and North Korea. “When Swiss banks fail to apply international anti-money-laundering standards properly, Switzerland itself becomes a high-risk jurisdiction,” said Markus Ferber, the coordinator on economic affairs for the EPP, which represents Europe’s centre-right political parties. “When the list of high-risk third countries in the area of money laundering is up for revision the next time, the European Commission needs to consider adding Switzerland to that list.” The EPP released the proposal after media outlets including the Guardian, Süddeutsche Zeitung, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), and Le Monde revealed how a massive leak of Credit Suisse data had uncovered apparently widespread failures of due diligence by the bank. What is the Suisse secrets leak? Suisse secrets is a global journalistic investigation into a leak of data from the Swiss bank Credit Suisse. It comprises more than 18,000 bank accounts that were leaked to Süddeutsche Zeitung by a whistleblower who said Swiss banking secrecy laws were ""immoral"". The data, which is only a partial capture of the bank’s 1.5 million private banking clients, is linked to more than 30,000 Credit Suisse clients. The leak includes personal, shared and corporate bank accounts – holding, on average, 7.5m Swiss francs (CHF). Almost 200 accounts in the data are worth more than 100m CHF, and more than a dozen are valued in the billions. While some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000. Many of those were still open well into the last decade, and a portion remain open today. The Guardian was among more than 48 media partners around the world including journalists at Le Monde, NDR, the Miami Herald and the New York Times. They spent months using the data to investigate the bank, in a project coordinated by Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). They unearthed evidence Credit Suisse accounts had been used by clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes, suggesting widespread failures of due diligence by the bank. It is not illegal to have a Swiss account and the leak also contained data of legitimate clients who had done nothing wrong. In its response, Credit Suisse said it ""strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices"". The investigation, called Suisse secrets, identified clients of the Swiss bank who had been involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes. “Bank privacy laws must not become a pretext to facilitate money laundering and tax evasion. The Suisse secrets findings point to massive shortcomings of Swiss banks when it comes to the prevention of money laundering,” Ferber said. “Apparently, Credit Suisse has a policy of looking the other way instead of asking difficult questions.” He added that the close ties between EU and Swiss banks meant that anti-money-laundering deficiencies in Switzerland’s banking industry “also pose a problem for the European financial sector”. Credit Suisse said in a statement it “strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices”, arguing that the matters uncovered by reporters were largely historical and based on “selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank’s business conduct”. Its lawyers told the Guardian any past individual failings by the bank did not reflect its current business policies, practices or culture. The bank has since announced it has set up an internal taskforce to investigate the leak. “We have robust data protection and data leakage prevention controls in place to protect our clients,” it said. Switzerland’s government declined to comment on the EPP statement, but said the country meets international standards around exchange of tax information, money laundering, terrorist financing and corruption. The country’s addition to the EU high-risk third countries list would mean regulated professions, such as bankers, lawyers and accountants, would be required to conduct enhanced due diligence on any transaction or commercial relationship with a person or company in the country. Tom Keatinge, the director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the defence thinktank RUSI, said that being added to the EU list could have a significant and far-reaching impact on Switzerland’s banks, as well as its broader financial sector. “There is the potential for considerable collateral damage,” he said. The Credit Suisse data was leaked to Süddeutsche Zeitung by an anonymous source who complained about “immoral” Swiss banking secrecy laws. In Switzerland, politicians and media organisations reacted angrily to the discovery that Swiss investigative journalists had been prevented from participating in the Suisse secrets investigation because of the country’s notorious banking secrecy law. Swiss law has for decades criminalised the disclosure of banking information by financial professionals. However, in recent years it was expanded to cover outsiders receiving banking data, potentially including investigative journalists. Amid international controversy, Andrea Caroni, a Swiss politician who in 2015 advocated expanding article 47, the infamous section of a 1934 banking law that introduced extreme secrecy regulations, accepted on Monday that “maybe the rules are not set perfectly” and suggested he would be open to considering a review. Samira Marti, a national councillor for the Swiss Social Democratic party, said the group would submit a proposal to combat article 47’s “censorship” in the spring session of the Swiss parliament, and called on the country’s centrist party, Die Mitte, and the Green Liberal party to support them. The Green Liberals said they would back Marti’s call for action. “Journalism plays an essential role in uncovering illegal practices,” said Julie Cantalou, a co-secretary general of the party. “We are therefore supportive towards the idea to reform article 47, and look forward to working with Samira Marti on this important matter.” Meanwhile, Switzerland’s Green party announced that it had tabled a legislative proposal for immediate reform of article 47. “The Suisse secrets show once again that Swiss banks continue to do business with dictators, autocrats and criminals,” the party said in a statement. “With a proposal submitted today, the Greens are now campaigning for an immediate revision of the Banking Act.” In what could be the first step towards a formal investigation into the Suisse secrets disclosures, Finma, the Swiss financial regulator, confirmed this morning that it was “in contact” with Credit Suisse concerning the investigation, but refused to be drawn on the details of its conversations with the bank. One Swiss commentator described the timing of the leak as “catastrophic” for Credit Suisse, which last year suffered a series of rolling scandals that battered its share price. Samuel Gerber, the deputy editor of the Swiss financial publication Finews, also warned that the bank’s latest controversy could jeopardise an international review of Switzerland’s anti-money-laundering measures expected to take place later this year. Referring to past scandals, Daniel Thelesklaf, the former head of Switzerland’s anti-money-laundering body, said Credit Suisse had “already lost a lot of its reputation”. “This can become another crack in the wall,” he said. “Unless Credit Suisse undergoes a massive change of culture, it will lose the trust of its remaining clients soon.”",News/News,Switzerland at risk of EU blacklist after Credit Suisse leak,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/21/switzerland-at-risk-of-eu-blacklist-after-credit-suisse-leak
2/22/2022,"There has been a break in the rain, and the sun is shining on the orange groves of Bir al-Maksur, a quiet Bedouin village near Nazareth in Israel’s north. Three-year-old Ammar would have loved splashing in the winter puddles outside the Hujarat family’s home, his aunt said. But two days before, the little boy was shot and killed in a playground by a stray bullet fired during a car chase, and the grieving family is trying to make sense of the way his life ended.  “The police don’t care what happens to Palestinians so [the gangs] know they can kill children while they are playing and nothing will happen. We are so angry,” said Ammar’s cousin, Imam, as she sat with his mother, Aisha. Still numb with shock, Aisha cradled her hands in her lap, eyes red from crying. Ammar was the first victim of 2022 claimed by the gun violence epidemic engulfing Israel’s Arab community: last year, a record 127 people lost their lives, and the numbers have risen year on year since 2013. At the same time, illegal firearms on the streets have proliferated. Some estimates put the number at hundreds of thousands of weapons, mainly stolen from Israeli military depots or smuggled over the Jordanian border. The gang violence means people in Israel’s 2-million-strong Arab minority are far more likely to be killed by fellow Arabs than Palestinians in the West Bank are by Israeli security forces. The prevailing assumption in the police to date, as one senior Israeli official put it, has amounted to: “As long as they are killing each other, that’s their problem.” About 20% of Israel’s population of 9 million people identifies as Arab, encompassing Bedouin and Druze as well as Muslim and Christian Palestinians. In theory, they are granted the same civil and political rights as Jewish citizens; in practice, these communities face severe institutionalised discrimination. In Arab and mixed-ethnicity neighbourhoods across the country, the gun violence crisis is a grim illustration of the issues facing minorities living in the Jewish state. Organised crime networks are deeply embedded in Arab society, who turn to mob bosses for loans when Israeli banks refuse their applications. Corruption and extortion in local politics is rife, as are protection rackets. The community distrusts and fears the police, leading Palestinian citizens of Israel to turn to traditional methods to solve disputes such as the sulha, a conflict resolution mechanism – in this context usually between rival clans or families. But with young Arab men the worst hit by the unemployment crisis caused by Covid-19, the streets are now full of well-armed foot soldiers willing to carry out hits for their bosses or, for the right price, wage someone else’s vendetta. The result is tearing at the social fabric that sustains these marginalised communities. Over the last month, the Guardian met more than a dozen people in the central city of Lod and towns around Israel’s “Arab triangle” who have lost innocent loved ones to gun crime. In Rambla, Mohamed Abu Muamar’s wife, beloved local teacher Sharifa, was killed by crossfire in August 2020 as she stood at the kitchen sink in the family’s second-floor apartment. She was found after the couple’s two-year-old tried to get her to wake up. “I can’t work, I am struggling with the children. I can’t even go back into the apartment now,” he said. “It’s too painful.” Other killings are calculated acts of brutality. In May last year, Chitam al-Wahwah’s youngest son Anas – an 18-year-old star student and volunteer with the ambulance service – was shot and killed in his car while she sat in the passenger seat, in what was apparently retribution for the wrongdoings of a distant member of the family. And sometimes feuds escalate thanks to the widespread availability of guns. In Qalansawe, neighbours Abier Hatib and Zahya Nasra lost their teenage sons, who were close friends, after members of a rival clan opened fire on a group of young men hanging out one weekend last March. The fight had originally started, months before, over a parking dispute. Killings of women by their partners and other male family members are also on the rise. “Most of this community was badly affected in 1948 [after the war surrounding Israel’s creation]. People were displaced, thrown into poverty. They had to start all over again, so of course there is crime,” said Fida Sh’hade, a local council member in Lod and one of several Arab women across Israel helping organise victims’ families into a vocal new political lobby called Mothers for Life. “What is happening now is the reality of what happens when schools, jobs, opportunities for a whole people are withheld. “About a decade ago, the police cracked down on the Jewish mafia, put the heads of the families in jail. Israel has the best security infrastructure in the world but the police can’t catch some Arab teenagers with guns, inside our own country? Come on. It shows exactly how much we are valued as citizens.” Only about a quarter of Arab murder cases were solved last year, compared with about 70% of murders of Jewish citizens – a disparity Israel police said in an emailed statement reflects that homicide investigations are “fraught with challenges”, including “lack of cooperation on the part of citizens”. All of the families the Guardian met, however, said their offers to help with investigations or entreaties for information on the progress in solving their cases had gone ignored. Abu Muamar, who agreed to testify against his wife’s killers, faced death threats from the gang, but nothing in the way of help from police except a roadblock at one end of his street. Israel’s new coalition government – which for the first time includes an Arab party – has made combating crime in the Arab community a central promise to the public, budgeting 1bn shekels (£230m) for more police stations in Arab towns and a special unit dedicated to Arab community affairs. In an interview, however, the Israeli cabinet minister for public security, Omer Barlev, who holds responsibility for policing, acknowledged it would take time for people to “really be convinced there is a change”. “In the last six months there has been a 30% jump in the number of people arrested and brought to trial,” he said. “Things were never done before with the intensity we are doing it today.” For victims who are organising and supporting each other through Mothers For Life, the umbrella group bringing Arab women’s voices to the forefront of politics for the first time, change cannot come quickly enough. In Bir al-Maksur, Ammar Hujarat’s home village, the family home was full of neighbours, relatives and strangers from far and wide who had come to pay their respects. “The solidarity from all these people, Muslim, Christian, Jewish, is the only thing keeping me strong right now,” said Aisha, the child’s mother. “I believe in the good of people. I never expected this would happen to us … I hope this anger will do something. The killing has to stop.”",News/World news,‘The police don’t care’: gun violence engulfs Israel’s Arab community,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/gun-violence-israel-arab-palestinian-community
2/22/2022,"Storms blew away last week’s planned premiere of English National Opera’s new version of Janáček’s 1924 hymn to the cycles of the living world. The opening was quickly rescheduled for Sunday afternoon, but it was a useful reminder that our coexistence in nature has a pitiless side, as well as the pantheistic charge that fires Janáček’s ecstatic score. Jamie Manton’s busy staging is fuelled by anguish not sentiment. The composer set his opera in a Moravian forest, where a woodman captures a young vixen, who escapes back to the wild to raise a brood of cubs, only to fall victim to a hunter from the village. But Tom Scutt’s designs, fiercely lit by Lucy Carter, give us instead a deforested landscape, blasted by logging, in which the rhythms of life play out against a backdrop scroll that unwinds a visual representation of the story to reveal a chillingly blank sheet at the close.  All the same, there is abundance of colourful life on stage too, with all the insects, birds, mushrooms and animals that make any staging of Janáček’s opera, including this one, by turns a delight and a risk. Jenny Ogilvie’s movement direction gets laughs as well as poignancy from a menagerie in which Joy Constantinides’s dragonfly, Clare Barnett-Jones’s dog, John Findon’s cockerel and Robert Berry-Roe’s frog all make their mark. There are fox cubs and hens in profusion, while hooded “timekeepers” shift the scenery and provide a constant reminder of the opera’s dark side. Martyn Brabbins conducts industriously but in a rather generalised sweep. Sally Matthews brings vocal allure to the Vixen that enables her to convey the opera’s transcendent qualities. She is well matched by the brighter soprano of Pumeza Matshikiza’s Fox. Lester Lynch’s Forester is richly toned and sympathetic in his getting of wisdom, but articulation, especially important in this opera, is not a strong point for any of them. Ossian Huskinson, who makes an impressive impact as the poacher Harašta is, by contrast, exemplarily clear. So are the experienced pairing of Alan Oke and Clive Bayley, who capture the important dramatic counterpoint of the unfulfilled lives of the village schoolmaster and priest.

2/22/2022,"Clad in yellow hi-vis jackets on a picket by a busy Coventry layby, striking bin-lorry drivers wave and raise fists every time a passing vehicle honks in support, which is frequent. History weighs on the minds of the strikers. An engineering and carmaking hub known as “motor city” and the birthplace of the iconic trade union leader Thomas Mann, Coventry’s past cannot be disentangled from that of the labour movement, or a Labour party that has run the council for 43 of the past 49 years. Yet one of the strikers, 60-year-old Peter Skerrett – a Labour member like his father before him – plucks his party card from his wallet, throws it in the mud and theatrically stamps on it. “How the hell can you keep paying for a political party that supposedly aspires to help workers when they’re actually working against us?”  Seventy drivers are on strike against their employer, the Labour-run council, over what their union’s deputy convener Peter Randle tells me is over “fair pay for a fair day’s work”. But this is a dispute with implications that go far beyond this West Midlands city of 350,000 people. These drivers are represented by the Unite union, and if Labour’s masters were expecting some respite after veteran organiser Sharon Graham succeeded Len McCluskey as general secretary last year, they have miscalculated. She has already threatened to cut Unite’s national funding to Labour over the Coventry dispute – and bear in mind the union is the cash-strapped party’s biggest donor – and she shows no undue sentimentality about the party. “The fact is the council is a bad employer, and I treat all bad employers the same,” she tells me. Macho briefings from Keir Starmer’s team haven’t impressed her either. “We would have hoped that Unite would have got the message that the Labour party is under new management,” they told journalists. “Well, so is Unite,” she says, with a twinkle. Since she became general secretary four months ago, Unite has won 49 disputes: Graham intends to add Coventry to the tally. The Coventry dispute foreshadows more to come. Even before the pandemic, wages were stagnating, and in the last quarter, real-terms pay was 0.8% down on a year earlier. It is in this context that Graham seeks “a rebirth of the trade union movement”, with “unions as the vehicle for change”. That means slapping down the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey (paid well over half a million pounds a year) who demanded “wage restraint” from workers. “Why should the Bank of England governor, a rich man, be telling workers to have pay restraint?”, she says, somewhat incredulously. At the core of her leadership is a belief that Unite’s political strategy over the last decade – to focus on remoulding Labour into a vehicle for radical transformation – has failed, and now industrial struggles must take precedence. Coventry may offer both an insight into what Starmer’s Labour represents, and what response it may provoke if it secures power. When I meet George Duggins, Coventry’s Labour council leader, he is in unrepentant mood. The council has distributed inflammatory anti-strike leaflets, claiming bin-lorry drivers are paid up to £52,000. All the drivers I meet on the picket line are on between £24,000 and £27,000, and have the payslips to prove it. The result? Earlier in the strike, drivers were subjected to shouts of “greedy bastards” from members of the public; one striker has had his family car’s tyres slashed. But Duggins doubles down, producing a spreadsheet suggesting one driver is indeed paid this amount: he would have to work 11 hours a day, 7 days a week to make that sort of money, and no other driver earns anywhere near it. So why use that example? Duggins is indignant when I compare this approach to Tories seeking out exceptional examples of benefit claimants to justify rolling back the welfare state. But can he see why such leaflets fuel abuse? “I’ve made it clear that as far as I’m concerned, abuse will not be tolerated and if there’s physical abuse then we will prosecute.” The core dispute is over which pay grade should be applied to the drivers, and here Duggins believes he has an ace to play. They can’t settle, says Duggins, because the council has determined that drivers have a grade 5 job, and it therefore can’t upgrade them to grade 6 “because it breaches the Equality Act”, which will lead them being inundated with other pay claims costing millions of pounds. “That is just nonsense, absolute nonsense,” says Graham. Her union believes the council has altered the job description to downgrade drivers, and notes their counterparts in Birmingham are being paid the rate that is being asked for. “There haven’t been any equal pay claims there, but if they are suggesting they’re shortchanging other workers for the job that they do well, they should not be doing that.” To Unite’s fury, the council leader and his fellow councillors have refused to personally attend any of the negotiations. That councils such as Coventry have suffered devastating government cuts is undeniable, and that imposes painful spending dilemmas. But the bin-lorry drivers also have increasingly painful dilemmas about how they spend their pay packets as prices surge. When Starmer was interviewed by a local journalist, he scoffed at the idea a strike in Coventry should “influence relations between the Labour party and its trade unions”. The insinuation was clear – why should a local dispute in Coventry, of all places, impact national politics? But this is a grave error. The hardship suffered by workers here is being experienced across the country: it is a national issue. Here is an opportunity for Labour to turn “levelling up” into a phrase of substance by working with union leaders like Sharon Graham to raise wages and improve working conditions in the UK. What a tragedy to waste it.

2/22/2022,"Prosecutors have named the police officers charged over allegedly sharing racist and misogynistic messages on a WhatsApp group that included the officer who kidnapped and murdered Sarah Everard. The Crown Prosecution Service last Thursday announced charges against two serving Metropolitan police officers and one former officer, but kept their identities secret.  The investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) began after a phone belonging to Wayne Couzens, then serving as a Metropolitan police officer, was seized and searched. He was later convicted of the kidnap, rape and murder of Everard, who went missing as she walked home in south London in March 2021. On Monday, the CPS named the officers alleged to have shared “grossly offensive” messages between April and August 2019. Senior CPS lawyer Rosemary Ainslie said: “Following a referral of evidence by the Independent Office for Police Conduct, the CPS authorised charges against two serving Metropolitan police officers and one former officer. “PC Jonathan Cobban, 35, PC William Neville, 33, and former officer Joel Borders, 45, will appear at Westminster magistrates court on 16 March for their first hearing. “Each of the three defendants has been charged with sending grossly offensive messages on a public communications network. The alleged offences took place on a WhatsApp group chat.” The two serving Met officers had been suspended from duty, the force said. The IOPC said: “Police constable Jonathon Cobban, aged 35, and former constable Joel Borders, 45, are both charged with five counts of sending grossly offensive messages on a public communications network contrary to section 127 of the Communications Act 2003. “PC William Neville, 33, is charged with two counts of the same offence. The offences are alleged to have occurred variously between April and August 2019. “The IOPC’s investigation began following a referral from the [Met] in April last year (2021) and was completed in December when we referred a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The CPS has taken the decision to authorise charges against the officers.” In September Couzens received a whole-life sentence, meaning he will never be released from prison. Two inquiries are under way into policing following details of Couzens’ crimes being made public. One, ordered by the Met, is being conducted by Dame Louise Casey. The other, ordered by the home secretary, is being conducted by Dame Elish Angiolini. Ainslie added: “The function of the CPS is not to decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence, but to make fair, independent and objective assessments about whether it is appropriate to present charges to a court to consider. “Criminal proceedings are active and nothing should be published that could jeopardise the defendants right to a fair trial.”",News/UK news,Met officers charged over Wayne Couzens WhatsApp group named,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/21/met-officers-charged-over-wayne-couzens-whatsapp-group-named
2/22/2022,"Conservative MPs are organising a revolt against the prime minister over the scrapping of a ban on the imports and sale of fur and foie gras. Government sources have confirmed to the Guardian that reports of a U-turn were “broadly correct”, despite the fact the bans were mentioned in the government’s action plan for animal welfare and aimed at bringing swing voters on side. The 2019 manifesto, which referred to the action plan, also committed to not compromising on animal welfare standards in international trade. The production of both fur and foie gras are banned in the UK. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesperson said the government was still “fully committed to animal welfare”.  MPs in favour of a ban said they were shocked by the news and were demanding an explanation from Boris Johnson. Lorraine Platt, a grassroots Tory campaigner who is known as the “unofficial whip” on animal welfare policies, is organising an influential group of MPs to lobby the prime minister to think again. Platt is the founder of the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation, which counts cabinet ministers including Dominic Raab and Zac Goldsmith among its members. She said: “We can’t let Boris be swayed off course by a minority of dissenters. We’ve known for some time there’s been a small minority of MPs who are against any ban on foie gras and fur imports. “We will be taking some action on this. We will be encouraging this measure to go forwards.” Sir Roger Gale, the MP for North Thanet, who has handed in a letter of no confidence to the 1922 Committee asking for Johnson to resign, said he thinks the prime minister made the choice to pander to the right wing of the party to strengthen his position. He said: “The amount of positive publicity these policies have had, it seems a strange decision. It’s not going to please anyone except a few hard-right MPs who regard this as woke nonsense. “I don’t know whether he’s trying to pander to the hard right in the Conservative party to see if he can prop up his administration. But reneging on these undertakings will do more harm in the parliamentary party than good.” It is thought Johnson was lobbied to scrap the policies, seen as pandering to the more ecologically minded wing of the party, by figures including Jacob Rees-Mogg. Rees-Mogg has been contacted for comment. One Tory who has been outspoken about his enjoyment of foie gras and lack of enthusiasm for a ban is Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee, who has previously said: “I don’t much like the idea of having to go abroad to eat my favourite foods. And will you be allowed to smuggle foie gras on the Eurostar? For personal use?”",News/World news,Tory MPs plan revolt over U-turn on fur and foie gras import ban,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/tory-mps-plan-revolt-over-u-turn-fur-foie-gras-import-ban
