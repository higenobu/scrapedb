4/27/2022,"Ring doorbell footage in Australia caught the terrifying moment when a spider crawled over the lens and seemingly looked directly into the camera. Bitcoin ETFs: What are they and how to invest in them? Twitter user @fictillius, who was identified as Evan Smith via Storyful, uploaded the video to his Twitter account with the caption “Unexpected visitor at the front door.” See this tiny New York apartment get an impressive redesign in one day with a $1,000 budget: Smith told Newsweek that he lives near bushland, which is known for housing spiders. It’s estimated that Australia has around 10,000 different species of spiders, which are the most widely distributed venomous creatures on the continent. Australia’s spiders are so large because of the warm climate and because areas like the bushland that Smith lives near provide a lot of food for them. April is also the tail end of what Australians have dubbed “spider season.” Experts say that because November to April is the wettest time of year, particularly in southern Australia where Smith lives, spider populations can increase. “I keep honeybees and native bees in my backyard, so I try not to spray any insecticides around outside,” Smith added. While the specific spider that was crawling on his Ring camera isn’t identifiable, Twitter users were nonetheless horrified at the video. “So you’ve moved out then, right?” one person asked Smith. “House has been torched, homeless now,” he joked in reply.

4/27/2022,"Ric Flair, celebrated WWE wrestling superstar, gets emotional remembering the death of his son Reid Flair. During an interview on The Pivot, WWE hall-of-famer Ric Flair reflected on the death of his son Reid, who died of a drug overdose nearly nine years ago. He also talked about the time when it was thought he had only a 5% chance of recovery during his battle with kidney failure. While talking about the episode, which he had previously outlined in 30 for 30, Flair said that when he returned home after an evening out with his friends, he saw his son collapse on the floor. He had faced this scenario several times before, so he decided to put him back to bed instead of calling 911. But when he went to call his son in the morning to go to WrestleMania, he found an overdosed Reid who “was purple again, which I've seen, and, that Narcan didn't work the same.” It was then that he realized that Reid didn’t make it. “I just, I was in shock,” he said.",U.S./The Recount,"WWE legend Ric Flair gets emotional remembering the death of his son: ""He was on my watch.""",https://news.yahoo.com/wwe-legend-ric-flair-gets-164255404.html

4/27/2022,"What actually went down at Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s downtown LA penthouse six years ago was back in the spotlight today in the former Pirates of the Caribbean star’s $50 million defamation case against his ex-wife.. With Depp, Heard, the jury and everyone else in the packed Virginia courtroom watching the video monitors, LAPD Officer Melissa Saenz bluntly said that “I did not identify her (Heard) as a victim of domestic violence.” More from Deadline Johnny Depp Ends Testimony Proclaiming He's Victim Of Domestic Abuse; $50M Defamation Trial Expected To Hear From Amber Heard In Next Few Weeks - Update How To Watch The Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial: Livestream Of Police Officer's Testimony Johnny Depp: A Career In Photos From 'Platoon' to 'Pirates' And Beyond Under questioning by the defense team, the March 21021 deposition showed the 12-year LAPD vet detailed her experience entering and observing the couple’s South Broadway home around 9 PM PT on May 21, 2016. At the conclusion of that visit, Officer Saenz filed a report that the incident was “closed” because there was no crime. Officer Saenz admitted that neither she or her partner took any notes or took any photos of the call to the Depp-Heard home. She also admitted Heard was “red-eyed,” “crying” and not making eye contact when they arrived. While saying she had no idea who the residents were, the LAPD officer said she was “impressed” by the penthouse and recognized it belonged to someone wealthy. An elevator video of the two officers leaving the penthouse caused some friction between Heard’s lawyer and Officer Saenz with the latter denying she told her partner “that was crazy.” Both Officer Saenz and her trainee partner Officer Tyler Hadden gave depositions in Depp and Herd’s 2016 divorce proceedings on what they saw and deduced from being on the scene at the then couple’s DTLA residence on May 21, 2016 in response to a domestic violence call. In that July 2016 deposition, a mere two months after the incident at Depp and Heard’s place, In that 2016 deposition, Officer Saenz said that she “interviewed Ms. Heard and “closely examined her face and found no marks, swelling, or injury to her face.” Six years ago, Officer Saenz said that Heard “told her she was not hurt, nor was Ms. Heard making a complaint against Mr. Depp.” The playing of Officer Saenz year old deposition continues with attorneys for Depp questioning her. Earlier in the day, the not board certified forensic psychologist Dr. Shannon Curry told the court as a part of Depp’s argument that she considered Heard to have Borderline Personality Disorder and Histrionic Personality Disorder. Hired by Depp’s legal team after a dinner at the actor’s home with them, him and Depp’s right-hand man and former attorney Adam Waldman, Dr. Curry made her diagnosis based in bulk on a 12 hour session with the actress late last year. She said that she provided Heard with a test that gave out 567 statements which she had to answer true or false. Dr. Curry went on to say that others with similar scores as Heard showed traits such as externalization of blame, inner anger and hostility. She told the court that those with borderline disorder “can react violently, they can react aggressively. “Often times they will be abusive to their partners in these situations,” Dr. Curry noted. She also said that they can use what she called “administrative violence,” or making threats that they will use the legal system such as filing for a restraining order by claiming abuse. In cross examination after Tuesday’s lunch break, Head lawyer Elaine Bredehoft took Newport Beach-based Dr. Curry to task for her perceived closeness to the Depp camp and the “coincidence” of her diagnosis exactly matching the taunts that the Edward Scissorhands actor directed at Heard, as was played for the court in audio recordings yesterday. With Bredehoft reading from the psychologist’s deposition of earlier this year, Dr. Curry also confirmed that she has never concluded or arrived at an opinion that Ms. Heard “exhibits patterns of behavior that suggests her allegations of abuse against Mr. Depp are false.” Designation documents submitted by the Depp team suggested otherwise, as the defense lawyer took no small pleasure in pointing out. The three to four hour long dinner and meeting that Dr. Curry had at Depp’s house before being retained was repeatedly a topic under cross examination. Specifically, how “highly irregular” taking such a meeting in such a setting and the gathering itself not being revealed in any documents in relation to Dr. Curry’s expert role in the plaintiff’s case. Clearly, with time spent in the minutiae and in reference to other doctors’ notes, Bredehoft was trying on this ninth day of the much delayed trial to show bias in Dr. Curry’s testimony. With Dr. Curry remaining relatively composed in the spotlight, whether or not Bredehoft succeeded making that point of bias to the jury is hard to tell at this point. Certainly, the frequently brought up idea of one party being “gaslit” by the other brought a wrinkle to the argument. Dr. Curry actually noted that it is rare for men to accuse women of abusing them when they are in fact the perpetrator. Correspondingly, the POV that a relationship characterized by abuse over four years, as Heard claims was the case with Depp, can lead not only to trauma but symptoms similar to the disorders Dr Curry labelled the actress with. A few years after the couple’s very public and restraining order filled divorce in 2016, Depp has often said that he was the victim of domestic abuse in the relationship with Heard, and not the other way around. Almost three years after Depp and Heard’s divorce and its joint statement of responsibility, the past Oscar nominee sued his Rum Diary co-star in March 2019 in Virginia for a late 2018 Washington Post op-ed Heard wrote about being a victim of domestic abuse. Noted frequently at that point and subsequently is the fact that the op-ed in the Jeff Bezos-owned broadsheet never actually mentioned Depp by name. Still, fresh in the midst of various litigations at the time, Depp proclaimed that the article was clearly referring to him. Additionally, the past A-list actor said insisted that the op-ed cost him well-paying roles, a return to the Pirates franchise and “devastated” his career. That assertion has been a matter of extreme dispute in this April 11 starting trial, with defense lawyers pointing out Disney had already pulled back from having Depp in another Pirates film after the fiasco and box office disappointment of 2017’s Dead Men tell No Tales. Also, Heard’s lawyer Ben Rottenborn had Depp admit that even if he were offered “$300 million dollars” plus more by Disney to be in another Pirates flick he would turn them down. The argument goes to the heart of any damages Depp is seeking from Heard in the already high standard of proving defamation. Since Depp’s 2019 filing, the Old Dominion case has seen Heard unsuccessfully attempt to have the action dismissed or shifted to California. As a result, Heard also countersued Depp for $100 million in the summer of 2020. Of note, in late 2020, Depp himself proved unsuccessful in his UK libel trial against Rupert Murdoch’s The Sun tabloid for calling him a “wife-beater” in print. Both the countersuit and the British case loom over the proceedings underway in the Fairfax County Courthouse today. Monday saw Depp wrap up his several days of testimony on his own behalf. In court every day since the five-week long trial began, Heard is scheduled to take the stand herself in the next week or so.

4/27/2022,"Three juveniles from the same group of minors accused of stomping on a woman in downtown Boston last week, allegedly targeting her in an unprovoked attack because of her race and hairstyle, were arrested again on Monday after allegedly assaulting McDonald’s employees and police officers. This comes as the Boston Police Department has described in police reports over the past several weeks ""a recent barrage of juvenile incidents"" withing District A-1 ""involving young teenagers fighting in public, causing disturbances inside businesses, vandalizing storefronts by smashing glass window with blunt objects, aggravated assaults, assaults on police officers, and civil rights violations."" The Boston Herald reported that three juveniles were arrested early Monday morning in connection to an incident that erupted at the Roxbury McDonald’s at 301 Warren St around 11:30 p.m. Sunday. BOSTON JUVENILES' BROAD DAYLIGHT BEATING OF WOMAN ALLEGEDLY TARGETED FOR RACE, HAIRSTYLE CAPTURED ON VIDEO A police report says a group of minors began throwing rocks and water bottles at customers and employees in the drive thru. One of the workers responded by throwing items back at the minors. When a cup of soda splashed onto one of the teen’s jeans, the juvenile allegedly came inside and punched the worker in the face. Boston 25 reported the worker dialed 911 but refused medical treatment. The group of minors came back less than an hour later to try to fight employees, and one of them was spotted allegedly swinging a metal cane toward the restaurant’s lights. The kids took off running but were apprehended by police around the corner. A police report says one of the juveniles hurled racial slurs at an officer and threatened to ""f--- him up."" The minors allegedly struck one of the officers and kicked another in the genitals. Three were apprehended but because of their ages were not held in custody and were returned to their parents, Boston 25 reported. Local news reports say the three minors were part of the same group of juveniles accused of beating down a 20-year-old woman in broad daylight in an attack in the Downtown Crossing area. A police report says the victim told investigators a group of as many as 20 Black girls swarmed around her and called her ""a white b---- with braids."" The victim said she identified as ""Hispanic"" and tried to leave, but the group came up from behind, grabbed her by the hair and began punching and kicking her. Five juveniles were charged in connection to the incident captured on video. The police report said the juveniles, including one as young as age 12, were trying to instigate a violent confrontation with police and hurled ""rude and racially motivated insults"" at officers placing some of them under arrest. The report also cites ""a specific group of violent juveniles terrorizing the Downtown Crossing area."" Last month, an 81-year-old man was assaulted by a group of four juveniles, described as one Black boy and three Black girls, while he was eating a hamburger at a different McDonald’s on Washington Street. According to a police report, they smacked him in the head and nailed him with whip cream before later moving on to a nearby bar and grill. The group allegedly requested alcohol but were denied service, then began shouting ""Black Lives Matter"" and hurled racial slurs and spat on patrons. They shattered a door as they were escorted out, the police report said. Just days later, the same group allegedly punched a female victim who refused to buy them ice cream and again shouted racial slurs.",U.S./Fox News,"Boston juveniles hurling racial slurs, 'terrorizing' downtown arrested again in McDonald's brawl: police",https://news.yahoo.com/boston-juveniles-hurling-racial-slurs-173621929.html

4/27/2022,"The UK supports Ukraine's right to strike Russian territory using Western supplied weapons, a defence minister has said. James Heappey said it was ""completely legitimate"" for Kyiv to targeting Russia supply chains that contribute to ""death and carnage on Ukrainian soil"". He added that the weapons the West - including the UK - is giving to Ukraine ""have the range to be used over the border"" into Russia. ""The fact is that Ukraine was a sovereign country that was living peacefully within its owner borders and then another country decided to violate those borders and bring 130,000 troops across into their country,"" he told Times Radio on Tuesday.

It has now been 62 days since Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Russia, causing over five million people to flee Ukraine in search of safety. Western intelligence suggested Putin expected to have control of the country within a matter of days, but more than two months later his troops have been forced out of the north and reportedly suffered huge losses. Russia has not put out an exact figure of how many soldiers have died since the beginning of the conflict. Ukrainian authorities have estimated more than 21,000 Russian soldiers have so far been killed. On Monday, Russian defence minister Sergei Lavrov said there was a ""real danger"" of the conflict slipping into a third world war, and said Russia viewed Nato as being “in essence” engaged in a proxy war as sovereign nations are supplying Ukraine with weapons. Lavrov claimed Russia was striving to prevent nuclear war as they continued the invasion. ""This is our key position on which we base everything,"" he said on Monday. ""The risks now are considerable. I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. ""Many would like that. The danger is serious, real. And we must not underestimate it."" But his claim shows Russia “senses defeat in Ukraine,” his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba said He said: ""Russia loses last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine. ""Thus the talk of a ‘real’ danger of WWIII. This only means Moscow senses defeat in Ukraine. ""Therefore, the world must double down on supporting Ukraine so that we prevail and safeguard European and global security.""",News/Yahoo News UK,UK backs Ukraine's right to launch strikes on Russia soil,https://news.yahoo.com/uk-supports-ukraines-right-attack-russian-territory-says-minister-083608511.html
