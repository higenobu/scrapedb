1/27/2022,"Having spent every minute of his decorated career at Bayern Munich, could Germany legend Thomas Müller be ready to muddy his spats in the Premier League? “No,” would seem to be the obvious answer, considering the 33-year-old Raumdeuter is still banging them in for the Bundesliga champions. Nevertheless, that hasn’t stopped British media outlets from pouncing on a story from Bild that claims Newcastle and Everton have both hatched ambitious plans to sign him in the summer. Currently in Ecuador on international duty with Brazil, at various points yesterday Bruno Guimarães was off to Newcastle, then he wasn’t, then he was again. With so much uncertainty the Mill isn’t about to claim to have a clue what the future holds for the Lyon midfielder, but Fabrizio Romano, our man in the know, says a €40m (£33.5m) deal has been agreed between the clubs and “subject to details involving agents and the clubs being finalised, Guimarães will take a medical when he returns to Brazil”. Arsenal and Juventus are monitoring the situation with interest.  Contact-haver-in-chief Romano also claims Southampton are ready to offer a club-record £25m to make the loan move of Chelsea striker Armando Broja to St Mary’s a more permanent arrangement, but with Romelu Lukaku having such an indifferent time of things, it seems unlikely that Thomas Tuchel would be willing to let the young Albanian leave Stamford Bridge. The future of Rumour Mill-staple Tanguy Ndombele remains completely up in the air. Unwanted at Tottenham, the French midfielder had been linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain, who need to get rid of Julian Draxler, Danilo Pereira, Leandro Paredes or Ander Herrera to free up a dressing-room peg and training ground parking space for him. Everton and Valencia are both ready to hijack the deal should PSG fail to shift any deadwood. Having laughed a £9m offer from Newcastle for central defender Dan Burn out of the gate, Brighton would quite like to sign Abel Ruiz from Braga but have had their opening bid for the 21-year-old Spanish striker rejected by the Portuguese club. Left out of Arsenal’s travelling party to Dubai for their warm-weather training camp, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been offered to Sevilla and Barcelona on loan, but neither club is prepared to cover his £300,000 weekly wages. Arsenal, by contrast, are prepared to cover the wages of Douglas Luiz and are ramping up their efforts to sign the combative Aston Villa midfielder before the window closes. And finally, in Cameroon representing Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations – for whom he scored against Cape Verde on Tuesday – Marseille striker Bamba Dieng is attracting interest from Newcastle, Burnley, Crystal Palace and West Ham. The 21-year-old is reported to be available for £8m from the cash-strapped French club.",Sport/Football,Football transfer rumours: Müller to swap Bayern for Newcastle or Everton?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/27/football-transfer-rumours-muller-to-swap-bayern-for-newcastle-or-everton
1/27/2022,"If you have visited Stamford Bridge over the past years, you may well have spotted a 12-metre-tall mural, hanging high on the West Stand wall. Painted by the British-Israeli street artist Solomon Souza, it depicts three footballers: Julius Hirsch and Árpád Weisz, Jewish players murdered at Auschwitz, and Ron Jones, an English POW and Auschwitz survivor. Today, on the 77th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz concentration camp, the world commemorates International Holocaust Remembrance Day. We honour Hirsch, Weisz and the millions of people who were brutally murdered, alongside the millions of others targeted and killed by the Nazis and their collaborators.  International Holocaust Remembrance Day is a stark reminder of where hate and antisemitism can lead if not countered. Worryingly, this year’s commemoration efforts on 27 January will take place against a backdrop of rising antisemitism and Holocaust distortion all over the world. The world of football is not immune to this trend. Antisemitic chants can still be heard from football stands across Europe. Over the past year, incidents have been recorded of Jewish fans being abused. Nazi salutes have been used at football matches, and antisemitic slurs continue to plague football-related discussions online. Because understanding the history of the Holocaust plays a vital role in changing attitudes, Chelsea have partnered with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) to honour the victims and survivors of the Holocaust, and to shine light upon this dark history and its impact on the world of football. As the story of Julius Hirsch teaches us, antisemitism has a long history in the sport. Hirsch was a German-Jewish professional footballer who played for the German national team. In 1933, shortly after the Nazis came to power, he sat down to pen a painful letter to Karlsruhe Football Club (KFV), the club he had been loyal to since the age of 10. “Today I read in the Stuttgart Sports Report that the major clubs, including the KFV, have made a decision that Jews should be removed from the sports clubs,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, I must now announce my resignation from my dear KFV with a heavy heart, a club to which I have belonged since 1902.” Hirsch endured years of persecution, forced labour and isolation. He was deported to Auschwitz in 1943, where he was murdered. His story reflects the experiences of thousands of other Jewish players around Europe who were persecuted and murdered. After the Nazi rise to power, sports clubs voluntarily excluded Jews from participation, local ordinances barred them from setting foot on the pitch, Jewish sports clubs were banned and their offices vandalised. Jewish athletes were eventually arrested, deported and murdered. Exclusion from sports played a major role in excluding Jews from society. Today, we are doing all we can to make sure this never happens again. Since 2018, Chelsea have run Say No To Antisemitism, a global awareness campaign to not only rid football of antisemitism but also to use our platforms to educate our audiences about the Holocaust and antisemitism, and to promote tolerance and acceptance. Chelsea first partnered with the IHRA in 2020 when they became the first sports team in the world to adopt its working definition of antisemitism. Many clubs and leagues have since followed suit, building educational and training programmes for players and fans that address antisemitism in football. These developments are positive, and we call upon more clubs and leagues around the world to join this coalition and commit to getting rid of antisemitism from our stadiums. This month, the IHRA and Chelsea are launching a campaign to encourage people to reflect upon stories like Julius Hirsch’s using #WhyWeRemember. Chelsea FC have long commemorated the Holocaust, through ceremonies at the stadium and during match days. For two consecutive years commemorative activities have focused on honouring sportsmen and women who, like Julius Hirsch, lost their lives in the Holocaust. Hirsch’s story, memorialised on the wall of Stamford Bridge, reminds us that we all have a responsibility to remember and to act. Hate in the stadium doesn’t stay in the stadium. We know where it can lead us. We must do everything we can to make sure it never happens again. We must never turn a blind eye to hate or antisemitism – on International Holocaust Remembrance Day and every day thereafter.

1/27/2022,"Some of our words are missing. Have you noticed? The Labour shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, has, and he’s angry about it. Earlier this month he gave an impassioned interview for the BBC on Radio 4’s Political Thinking, raising the alarm about missing terms such as “breastfeeding” and “mother”, despite the fact that there is no campaign to remove these terms. Pope Francis has joined the chorus of discontent, warning of attacks on freedom of expression in the name of “cancel culture” and ideological colonisation. Of course, some of us never had our own words to start with. We’ve had to create our own or reclaim terms that have been used against us; we’ve had to find alternatives to the dehumanising language of state and medical institutions. Those of us who are lesbian or gay parents, mothers or fathers, have found new words to help others understand us and make our lives visible and valid: othermothers, gaybies, co-parents, daddy and pappa, MaPa, mummies and mummas. Not bad, considering we weren’t even allowed to exist a few years ago.  The erasure of identities and roles is something that LGBTQ+ parents and families are intimately acquainted with. Until section 28 of the Local Government Act was repealed, lesbian and gay families were defined legally as “pretended” families that must never be promoted. Lesbians were often found to be “unfit mothers”, and some had their children removed by the courts. Gay men were regularly branded in the national press as inherent predators and child abusers. Although section 28 was finally repealed in 2003 in England and Wales (2000 in Scotland), some of these attitudes still remain. In 2019, the then Labour MP Roger Godsiff said children of five years old shouldn’t be learning about gay parents. (By this logic, I would need to make sure my own children didn’t know about their parents’ existence until they were at least five years old.) As a non-biological parent, I regularly have to deal with misconceptions and assumptions about what my role is in relation to my children, and how these children came into existence. I’ve sometimes even been asked whether I should have children at all. My wife and I are married and have two children, most recently a new baby. As the law stands, if two women in a same-sex marriage are married when one of them conceives a child via a private sperm donor, at a clinic or using IVF, both women are legally parents to the child, and the child’s birth certificate lists mother and parent. Few people know what to call us, how to refer to our partners, how to invite us to functions, how to talk to us about our children, or how even to start conversation. I’ve been asked whether I mind that my wife presumably had to have sex with a man to get pregnant (she didn’t). We’ve had the awkward looks and conversations with health visitors and midwives about contraception, although this has been a lot easier and more informed with our second child than with our first. Professionals have phoned to congratulate the mother, as if I was completely unrelated to the child. I know health workers are just doing their best in an underfunded and overstretched context. I know fathers are often left out of such conversations too, or services just don’t have time to check in with anyone but the biological mother. It’s an obvious feminist issue that so much pressure and expectation is put on biological mothers, many of whom are left alone and isolated, presumed to naturally know how to care for a newborn, without that same presumption extending to their partner. Partly this is a result of the scant parental leave that co-parents and fathers are entitled to (still only a statutory two weeks). Shared parental leave, first introduced by the coalition government, means parents can take longer leave, yet less than 2% of eligible new parents are using this provision. Less than a third of eligible men now take any paternity leave. Gender stereotypes, macho workplace cultures, poverty pay, precarious work and the gender pay gap are all factors here. It is quite understandable, in the context of a heterosexual couple, why it may be an economic no-brainer for the father to go back to work first. For co-parents, it can be even more confusing. My own workplace is highly inclusive, but the only option I have for listing my leave on my employee record and wage slips is still “paternity leave”. With my first child, I attended numerous social events while on parental leave. At baby groups, my difference stood out. I was usually not included in coffee pre-meets or chats. People looked at me awkwardly and avoided starting conversations altogether, perhaps because they didn’t know what my role was, what to call me, or how to address me or my baby. Women would talk over and around me about night feeding, nappy rash or spare wipes. Once I was asked if I was my baby’s big brother. I’ve even been asked whether the baby is mine. This is what the erasure of words really looks like. It’s weird, embarrassed looks; it’s the feeling of marginalisation, whispers, bigoted remarks just loud enough to be heard. In this case it stems from the erasure of identities and families who fall outside the heterosexual norm. Those of us who were previously denied names and roles, who were imprisoned, medicated or institutionalised for daring to stick out, who were labelled as freaks or perverts – we are now making visible the lives, families and communities we have always built, and always been part of.

1/27/2022,"It is a shopper’s dream. A $250 coat can be bought for $50, hundreds of dollars of makeup can be sent to your door for just $20. The catch: you will eventually have to pay the full price of the purchase. But for now, only a fraction has to come out of your bank account. So goes the enticing nature of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL), the payment method that allows consumers to pay for their purchases in installments, largely without interest. But the multi-billion-dollar trend has government officials – and even some consumers – worried.  The benefit to consumers is hazier. Consumers report a complicated relationship with BNPL companies, one that is often characterized by an instant high off a purchase, followed by a comedown once the payments are deducted from their paycheck every few weeks. “Emotionally, when I get the package, I’m pretty happy,” said Sandra Lopez, 21, who lives in Atlanta. “Then it gets really stressful because you forget about the purchases. They come back at you. Once it’s payday, you’re again broke because you just feel like you don’t have any money … It’s not healthy.” Lopez said she has accumulated $400 in purchases from Klarna, a Swedish finance company that is one of the leaders in BNPL. Lopez said those were largely impulse buys, and that it is easy to lose control when using BNPL, especially when companies offer enticing deals like free $5 gift cards to consumers. “I know I’m making the purchases, but it’s also enabled my reach to even buy those items. Most of these items I wouldn’t be able to purchase with my credit card,” she said. Nearly every major US retailer is now offering some type of BNPL service to its customers, a change seen only within the last three years. Since 2019, BNPL has grown 300% in the US, reaching 45 million active users in the country by 2021. BNPL accounts for 2.4% of US online retail and is expected to keep growing. The top BNPL companies are some of the most lucrative in the financial tech industry. Square recently acquired Australia-based Afterpay for $29bn last year. Klarna was recently valued at $45.6bn. The soaring rise of BNPL has caught the eye of federal regulators at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which in December started an inquiry into the risks and benefits of BNPL loans. The agency has asked the five largest BNPL servicers – Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, PayPal and Zip – for their data and policies, citing concerns over a lack of consumer protection regulations. In a letter urging CFPB to take action, a group of US senators from the Senate’s banking committee said that BNPL loans have “the potential to cause consumer harm”. “BNPL providers currently operate without meaningful oversight. They are not generally subject to federal supervision that can spot unfair, deceptive or abusive practices or other violations of federal consumer protection laws,” they wrote. Regulators in other countries such as the UK and Australia, where BNPL has also ballooned in users, are also considering regulation. BNPL represented 2.1% of all global e-commerce transactions in 2020, according to research from FIS, and is expected to double by 2024. At a basic level, BNPL companies appear to have a mutually beneficial relationship with both retailers and consumers, often getting praise from both groups. The payment method is targeted toward those who do not have a credit card as approval for a loan is nearly instant, with a soft check on a consumer’s credit history. BNPL is especially popular among millennial and Gen Z consumers. For retailers, BNPL offers access to consumers who may otherwise not have made purchases. Consumers are also spending more when they use BNPL. Rue21, a clothing retailer, saw a 73% increase in the average purchase amount when the retailer started using Klarna, according to a case study published by the BNPL company. Other retailers have reported similar results. “With Klarna, we continue to see higher spend per visit and increased acquisition of new younger customers. 45% are under 40,” Macy’s CEO Jeff Gennettte told investors last spring. “Our goal is to convert all of these new customers to Macy’s loyal customers, who return for future purchases.” BNPL companies argue that they are offering a more equitable service than credit card companies and are offering consumers a fairer deal since they do not charge interest. Instead, BNPL companies operate on fees they charge retailers, which usually amounts to 1.5% to 7% of a transaction. In comparison, credit companies typically charge retailers 1% to 3% of a transaction. “Credit cards drive inequalities. Those who can afford to pay off their balances each month reap rewards through loyalty schemes while those who can’t afford to simply get more into debt,” Klarna CEO and co-founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in a statement to investors. “The credit card model is simply unsustainable for customers.” Siemiatkowski echoed recent reports that lavish credit card rewards are in a way subsidized by lower-income Americans who use cash or debit cards, but consumer advocates say that BNPL can also pose risks to consumers. “If they work as promoted, they may be helpful for consumers to help break down payments into a few smaller chunks without interest and without the long-term debt and interest of credit cards,” said Lauren Saunders, associate director at the National Consumer Law Center. “But there are definitely a lot of potential downsides.” Saunders said it is easier for consumers to take on debt with BNPL, loans are harder to track since they may not be all in one place, some companies charge late fees and consumers lack legal chargeback rights that protect them if they do not get the product they paid for. It is also unclear what using BNPL will mean for consumers’ credit scores. Purchases are not reported to the credit bureaus unless a missed payment ends up going to debt collectors, which could make a report. But all the major credit bureaus have indicated they will begin working with BNPL companies to get BNPL transactions on consumers’ credit reports. “Ultimately, we are concerned about how the product is developing and how the market is developing, and we hope that the CFPB will come up with substantive protections,” Saunders said.",Lifestyle/Money,"Buy Now Pay later schemes are catching the eye of consumers, and of federal regulators",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/27/buy-now-pay-later-schemes-entice-consumers-spend-more
1/27/2022,"Rising tensions on the Russia-Ukraine border have raised fears that Europe’s gas supply crisis could become far more serious. Gas market prices have already surpassed record highs and threaten to saddle European households with a cost of living crisis. Russia is Europe’s largest supplier of gas, of which a third flows through Ukraine’s gas pipelines to countries across the continent. Russian gas flows have been a quarter lower than usual over the past year, but European leaders now fear that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could spell an energy catastrophe if gas exports are cut.  White House officials said this week that the Biden administration is preparing to finalise a deal to “ensure Europe is able to make it through the winter and spring” by brokering a deal for major gas producing countries to send liquified natural gas (LNG) by tanker to Europe. It is not a plan without challenges. US officials have described the search for spare gas cargoes as “global”. But the talks are likely to focus on Qatar, one of the world’s biggest producers of gas and the second largest exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG) behind Australia. Qatar is a strong western ally in the Middle East and has supplied LNG to the UK and other European countries for years, shipped super-chilled via tankers. Libya may also be able to help given its strong gas production and close proximity to the continent. The US itself could play a direct role in bolstering Europe’s gas supplies too. A record number of LNG cargoes left the US destined for European ports over the last month, and the US has a strong long-term incentive to encourage Europe to give up its reliance on Russia – and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project – in favour of its own shale gas reserves. The scale of Europe’s gas supply challenge will depend on how far tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalate. Russia sends an estimated 230m cubic metres of gas to Europe every day, of which around a third travels west via Ukraine. But market experts are divided over whether Russia would be likely to disrupt all gas exports to Europe, or only those which rely on Ukraine’s gas pipelines. Others are sceptical over whether the Kremlin would tighten Russia’s gas taps at all. “If Russia weaponised its energy exports how much energy would they disrupt? It’s hard to scenario plan this,” said Helima Croft, the global head of commodities at RBC Capital. But the question is not whether the US could create a backstop for Russian gas supplies but whether it could source gas to help mitigate any disruption, she said. The global gas supply crunch which emerged as economies began to rebound following the Covid-19 slump means there is little spare gas to go around, according to analyst Xi Nan from Rystad Energy. The US has said that its conversations are “really broad, with a lot of companies and countries around the world” so that it wouldn’t need “to ask any one individual company or country to surge exports by significant volumes, but rather smaller volumes from a multitude of sources”. “The question,” said Croft, “is whether the US can find any slack in the system”. Qatar currently produces 77m tonnes a year (Mtpa) of LNG, but has contracted around 97Mtpa to buyers in Asia, Europe, Kuwait and major energy companies which can choose where they send each cargo. The US has also committed its 80m tonnes of LNG production to buyers in Asia, Europe and so-called “portfolio players”. But there is a possibility that some contracted cargoes earmarked for Asia could be diverted to Europe instead thanks to mild winter temperatures in the region which has reduced gas demand, said Croft. She added that it would take “delicate” discussions between major gas producers and their Asia buyers to negotiate some gas supply flexibility. There are plenty of examples of emergency supply measures in the global oil market, but not for gas. During Libya’s civil war Saudi Arabia agreed to increase its oil exports into the global market to make up a shortfall in Libyan crude which drove oil prices to $120 a barrel. More recently Saudi Arabia brokered a deal with members of the Opec oil cartel and its allies to make an unprecedented cut in oil production during the Covid-19 pandemic to avoid oil prices crashing to zero. The gas market lacks the same global cooperation, which has made responding to the global supply crisis more difficult. “Mohammed bin Salman [the Saudi crown prince] sees himself as the central bank for oil. There is no equivalent in the gas market,” said Croft. “Even if Qatar wanted to help they’re not sitting on the kind of dry powder that the Saudis could access through their oil reserves.” Perhaps unprecedented times will call for unprecedented measures.",News/Business,Energy crisis: where could Europe’s gas come from if Russia cuts exports?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/27/energy-crisis-where-could-europes-gas-come-from-if-russia-cuts-exports
1/27/2022,"And it all started so well. The England and Wales Cricket Board’s chief executive, Tom Harrison, began his appearance in front of the DCMS select committee with earnest thanks, to the MPs for the opportunity, and to Azeem Rafiq for his testimony, then eased into a well-rehearsed spiel about everything the ECB has been doing. He spoke about Inspiring Generations, the South-Asian Action Plan, the transformed women and girls pathway, his 12-point plan, £25m of new investment, how he had matched funding with broadcast partners, built a burgeoning link with Kick It Out, launched a new anti-discrimination unit, a dressing-room culture review, a game-wide census, and sweeping governance reform.  Harrison has a dashboard, a set of KPIs, and five different pillars. “On the talent pathways we want to get at least 30% of young boys and girls from ethnically diverse backgrounds,” Harrison said. “Among boys, in 2018, it was 11%, and now, thanks to our South-Asian Action Plan, it has moved to 28% …” And this was where the committee chair, Julian Knight, interrupted. “28%?” Knight asked, “but your target is 30%?” Harrison hummed. Knight continued. “To be clear, you’ve not just set yourself a target you’ve already reached?” Harrison hawed. Knight continued. “Your target is 30% by the end of this year, and you’re at 28% at the start of the year?” He did some quick sums. “You’ve done 17% in three years, that’s five-and-half per cent a year, you should really be at 35% shouldn’t you?” Knight wasn’t drilling down into Harrison’s plan here, he was only picking at it with his fingernail, and it was starting to crumble. “What we aim to do is to make sure we have a flood of talent coming through,” Harrison explained, the 30% target was going to be country-wide, right across the game by the end of the year, and maybe even through to the England dressing rooms, he said, by 2025 now. “We want to report on over-delivery against those KPIs and not an under-delivery.” Yes, Knight agreed, “because you’ve set yourself such a low target. Our dispute would be that these are targets that you are set up to achieve.” Harrison tried to pick himself up and pull himself together. “That’s the best stat I have to give you,” he said, “but I also want to mention that we have 2,000 South Asian female activators.” Female activators? There might be a good answer to all this, but Harrison didn’t manage to get it out. Knight likes cricket. He has played the club game all his adult life, opened the batting for the Lords and Commons team, and even wrote a book on it, Cricket For Dummies, before he became an MP. My guess is he understands the frustration so many English cricket fans feel towards the ECB because he shares it himself. You could hear it in his tone, which was impatient, and almost scornful, as if, after a lifetime following the game, he’s had about as much as he can stomach of the board’s executive bullshit. Harrison sometimes seems taken aback by this hostility. He shouldn’t be, it’s exactly how a lot of people who love the game feel. Listen to me talk about development, Harrison says, just don’t ask me why the ECB recently sacked 19 development staff. Listen to me talk about funding, he says, just don’t ask me why the ECB spends more on salaries than it does on grassroots cricket. We’ve lost the public’s trust, he says, I want to restore it, he says, but I also want my share of the £2.1m the ECB is paying out in executive bonuses. And no, you can’t ask him about that either “because it’s not appropriate for us to be discussing employment contracts”. After the year English cricket has had, how on earth is he still in his job? It’s hard to listen to the hearings without feeling like we’ve already heard enough from most of the people doing the talking, Harrison, ECB chair Barry O’Brien, Hampshire chair Rod Bransgrove, Middlesex chair Mike O’Farrell, members of an executive class who are desperately unrepresentative of the sport and, in many cases, hopelessly ill-equipped to tackle the problems it is facing. It’s often said that the biggest obstacle to the “sweeping governance reform” Harrison mentioned is that it would require the turkeys to vote for Christmas. Listening to O’Farrell felt like listening to the bird try to explain how to turn on the oven. Presumably O’Farrell could talk eloquently about the problems facing Kodak, where he spent 36 years of his career, or the British Acupuncture Council, which he used to run, or the church in Great Missenden, where he works as a warden, but it felt like an act of satire to put him up in front of a parliamentary committee as the man who’s going to explain how to fix structural racism in the grassroots of English cricket. If you want a proper answer ask the people who work at the Ace Programme. Ask the people who work at Chance to Shine. Ask the people who work at the MCC Foundation. Ask anyone but the men who are actually in charge. There was one ray of hope. The new Yorkshire chair, Kamlesh Patel, was as impressive as he has been right through this process. Patel is plain-talking, has a clear idea of what’s wrong and how to begin to fix it. Which isn’t to say he’s always right, just that he doesn’t talk like he thinks he is. He spoke proudly of the blind-hiring process Yorkshire used to find their new coach, Ottis Gibson. Through that blind process, Patel said: “We’ve gone from people who have been in the club a long, long time who were reasonable, to having one of the best coaches in the world as head coach.” Imagine what the sport would look like if it picked its chief executives and chairs in the same way.",Sport/Sport,"Tom Harrison can’t even talk a good game any more, so why is he still in charge? | Andy Bull",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/27/tom-harrison-cant-talk-good-game-why-is-he-still-in-charge-ecb-cricket

On Thursday afternoon, when Alcott lost his quad singles at Rod Laver Arena, he bid farewell to a sporting career matched by few. One featuring 23 grand slam quad titles including 15 in singles, Paralympic gold medals and a revered golden slam.  And while the 31-year-old fought but fell short to Sam Schröder of the Netherlands, succumbing 7-5, 6-0, his Australian of the Year predecessor, Grace Tame, watched from the stands. At one point Alcott saw Tame’s face pop up on the big screen, paused his service game and said “I love you Tame-y” before winning the point. At the post-match presentation he came close to tears while saluting the large number of disabled children in attendance. “It’s because of you all watching today that people like me get, not recognition, but are more integrated in society,” Alcott said. “To my community, thanks for always backing me – I hope to make you proud over the next 12 months. Thank you to every single person for changing my life, I appreciate it so much. “I’m really the luckiest guy in the world, and I didn’t need to win today to realise that. It would have been nice to win, to be honest, but I’m still the luckiest person in this country, if not the luckiest person in the world.” Alcott had admitted pre-match he was “fried” after rushing to Canberra for Tuesday night’s Australian of the Year ceremony straight after his semi-final win, absorbing all the associated emotion and publicity and then preparing for his “last dance”. The weariness as Schröder worked him around the court and drawing 31 unforced errors. “First of all, I want to say congrats to Dylan on having an amazing career.

1/27/2022,"“Giving someone the truth when they don’t want it is a sort of emotional violence,” says Roopa Farooki. “It’s as much an act of aggression as shaking their hands in the Covid era.” She should know. When the pandemic first struck the NHS, the novelist – three times nominated for the Women’s prize for fiction – was also one of its most junior doctors, with barely six months of medicine under her belt. The act of aggression to which she refers is not, however, pandemic-related. Everything Is True, her blistering new Covid memoir, begins in the wake of her sister’s death from breast cancer. When Farooki breaks down in tears at work on her sister’s birthday, she makes the fatal mistake, on being asked by a colleague if she is all right, of giving “an honest answer, like a psychopath”. Her disarming frankness about her dead sister sees the colleague practically sprinting off down the hospital corridor, leaving Farooki to observe wryly that she might as well have coughed in their face with her “snotty, messy tears”.  Defiant, uncompromising honesty drives every page of this book. With Do No Harm, retired neurosurgeon Henry Marsh set the trend for doctors confessing, with varying degrees of candour, their own psychological foibles and weaknesses. Yet none have been as ruthless as Farooki. If unwanted truth is emotional violence, then the act of reading her memoir is akin to a 12-round bout with Mike Tyson. Two hundred pages of hard, sinewy, unpalatable truth – the pandemic up close and thumpingly personal. The book charts the first 40 days of the UK’s pandemic lockdown – a nod to the original definition of “quarantine” (quaranta in Italian) as being precisely this period of isolation to prevent the spread of contagious disease. But a brief prologue describes something even more cataclysmic: her sister, Kiron, telling her she has only weeks left to live. Farooki’s response – having been taught at medical school that nobody wants miserable people around them when they’re dying – is a rictus smile: “You’re still smiling like you can’t help it, you must look insane. You can’t help it, like a skin-stripped skull can’t help it.” So begins her harrowing juxtaposition of sweeping, global catastrophe with the intensely personal ruination of grief. For Farooki, the onslaught of patients with Covid coincides with her immersion in “the sad fog, the painful aftermath” of her sister’s funeral. She already knows what it is like to outlive death, and finds herself sleepwalking numbly through the pandemic’s first days, scarcely noticing its unfolding horrors. “You have no idea what is happening … you’re only paying attention to what you’re feeling, to what you’re pushing six feet under, while you dig yourself out of bed and feed the children and march three miles to work and get on with your day.” Farooki finds herself juggling pandemic trauma with domestic banality, Covid deathbed vigils with kitchen-table nit checks. Labouring by day just to put one foot in front of the other, at night she writes alone in a compulsive fury. Regularly falling asleep on top of her keyboard, she produces “fragments of words spat out on to the screen. Emotional vomit. Pollock on the page.” Too skilful a writer to permit incoherence to tarnish her finished manuscript, she chooses nevertheless to preserve something of the disjointed nature of these sessions. Her prose is as fractured as her frame of mind, and her decision to document her experiences in the second person mimics the weird, jarring quality of grief. If anything, the frenetic demands of the hospital are a form of unhealthy solace, allowing Farooki to erase herself completely for the length of each shift. Slowly, numbness gives way to anger. Without realising it – and whether she likes it or not – she no longer works in an A&E but on a military “frontline”. The crass jingoism of journalists and politicians infuriates her. She is not a soldier, this is not a battle, and her patients most definitely do not live or die according to whether they possess a “fighting spirit”. Ironically invoking the unwanted martial imagery, she points out that she is “wrapped in scraps of plastic”, “taking the bullets without proper defence” and “fighting an insidious illness with … a paper mask”. Take that, Boris Johnson – or the “smug mop-headed bastard”, as she prefers to call him. Farooki knows it is predominantly the poor, vulnerable, Black and brown who are dying. So when the “mendacious middle-aged man” goes briefly to ICU for treatment, she is enraged that the country will be distracted by his live-tweeted progress, while the rest of the Covid dead are “buried like bad news”. More than anyone else, though, Farooki reserves her scorn for herself. In painful, poignant dialogues with her dead sister, she lambasts herself for courting risk to gain the high moral ground: “Skydiving. Rock climbing. Bungee jumping. These never appealed to you, so why this? Maybe you like being humourless and pious about helping people. Maybe you have an unhealthy pride in risking your life for others.” It is nonsense, of course. When a nursing colleague dies of Covid, Farooki finally feels fear. She finds her lack of PPE terrifying: “You’ll walk straight into the virus. You’ll soak it up in your hair like a sponge. You’re going to get it, too.” Sure enough, a month into lockdown, she contracts Covid. In her delirium, her sister’s voice attacks her: “For the record, I don’t think you’re a hero. I don’t think you’re brave. I think you’re a mildly talented eccentric who’s stumbled into a stupid time to start medicine.” In the end – the 40th day – Farooki has recovered but death is all around her: “It’s everywhere, and the air is constantly crackling with the expired electricity of it. The sound of breaking hearts is deafening. The new figures today are 40,000.” We are forced to confront the bleakest truth that now there are legions of the newly bereaved, each, like her, enduring shattering pain. Grief, Farooki concludes, is the long shadow cast by love. It hurts just as much as it ought to, as much as the deceased was loved. Beneath it all – the horror, the hypocrisy, the vertiginous death toll – Farooki is lonely. She simply and desperately misses her sister. Her memoir, a memorial of sorts, is startlingly honest and devastatingly good.  Everything Is True by Roopa Farooki is published (Bloomsbury Publishing plc, £14.99).

1/27/2022,"Elia Suleiman’s a man of few words, so we can be sure that the ones he does use have been chosen carefully. “What I am to do in this film, I actually accomplished,” the Palestinian film-maker told Indiewire upon the US release of his debut feature Chronicle of a Disappearance (now streaming on Netflix) in 1997. “Even when they object to the nature of the presentation of the film, a lot of people have delayed questioning. They don’t know how to invent the language that must deal immediately … There is no ready-made rhetoric that they could say, ‘I don’t agree with you on this or that.’ I mean, what can they pick on? My mother walking across the room?”  Like so many dissidents before him, Suleiman derives more power from silence than screams. In the breakout that earned him the prize for best first film at the Venice film festival and literally put Palestinian cinema on the map as the nation’s first production to receive a Stateside theatrical run, the writer-director-actor-producer prefers to play his politics close to the vest. He anticipated the controversy part and parcel to any work critical of the Israeli occupation, and pre-empted the pushback by couching his resentments in unremarkable moments. There’s no speechifying, no harrowing depiction of the bitterness or cruelty still festering around the West Bank; Suleiman thumbs his nose at the prospect with a scene that sees his onscreen avatar ES take the podium at a conference, only to be interrupted by whining feedback every time he gears up to speak. He instead articulates the placelessness he feels as a citizen without a country through brief, deadpan sketches in static wide shots oft-likened to the compositional sight gags of Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati. Like his real-life double, the mute ES has returned home following a self-imposed 12-year exile in New York, just as peace talks break down in the wake of Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination and the election of the hawkish Benjamin Netanyahu. Their names are left out of things, however, the atmosphere of acrimony indirectly seeping in through absurd little banalities. In Nazareth, the proprietor of a souvenir shop peddling phony holy water is mocked by a camel figurine that won’t stop tipping over. During the second half, which shifts focus to Jerusalem and a wrier register, a woman gets blackballed from every apartment listing she calls once they learn she’s an Arab. She pops up again later on in what appears to be a terrorist cell, until it’s revealed that their grenade and gun are just novelty lighters. The segments that confront the Israeli-Palestinian friction head-on do so with the most unassuming levity, as in the shot that sees Jerusalem police troopers hustle out of a van, line up to urinate against a wall, and sprint back into the van with a militaristic briskness. Suleiman prefers to let his pricklier remarks sit in tacit ironies of the everyday: kids frolicking in a swimming pool under the watchful gaze of a Yasser Arafat mural, men cheering on two geezers deadlocked in an arm-wrestle, tourists jet-skiing all over the sacred Sea of Galilee. Though these shots have been meticulously constructed, their delivery is matter-of-fact, as if we’re just seeing snapshots of vérité local color. Matching the stony face with which he portrays ES, Suleiman directs from a pose of aloofness that allows him a safe distance from his own subversion. If he seems reluctant to come right out and say what he means, that’s only because his feelings aren’t so easily organized as points to be made, the final stretch steeped in a cloudier ambivalence on Palestinian identity. The film is bookended by two of its few closeup shots, noteworthy for their earnestness as they depict the weathered skin of Suleiman’s actual, slumbering parents. Ultimately, he feels something deeper than mere anger on their behalf, more mournful at all they’ve had to live through. While he doesn’t claim to have all the answers to the planet’s thorniest geopolitical conflict, he does want peace. Any obliqueness in the stoicism of his approach can be ascribed to a pragmatist’s awareness of how the industry operates, knowing that overt statements could potentially turn off distributors or viewers. Netflix currently hosts this film and its follow-up Divine Intervention, but Suleiman’s latest work – the equally inspired It Must Be Heaven, in which he frankly paints a pair of Israeli characters as aggressors and intimidators – still hasn’t been acquired for US exhibition in the nearly three years since its premiere at Cannes. (Amusingly enough, its loose plot mostly concerns Suleiman’s difficulty with selling and promoting his films around the world.) Perhaps his methods have grown more explicit as the region’s body count rises, its deterioration also explaining why buyers aren’t snapping up an Israel/Palestine film. But in his career’s boldly self-assured earliest phase, placing quotidian scare quotes around his quiet rebellion made it more palatable for the global cinema circuit. As he himself asked, what would they have to pick on in a movie that stops to spend a few minutes watching a dog play keepaway with a hapless man’s bucket?
