4/28/2022,"A key adviser to the premier of the most populous province in Solomon Islands has expressed concern that the China-Solomons security deal could enable the prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, to use Chinese armed police and military personnel to quash democratic dissent and hold on to power for years to come. Celsus Irokwato Talifilu, who is an adviser to Daniel Suidani, the premier of Malaita province, said that while it was “fair” that Australia, the US and other regional partners had focused their attention on the prospect of a military base on the islands, the major fear for many in Solomon Islands was the erosion of democracy. “My main fear is [Chinese military or police personnel] put [Sogavare] in power for a long time,” he said. “People say we are a democratic country, of course it is. But when you have a force bigger than anyone else in the Solomons, it will be easy for him to use that force to support him and his ministers or those who are in government to ensure they come back at the next elections.” The comments came as Australia’s spy chief said Canberra was concerned Chinese police deployed to Solomon Islands under a new security pact could use “ruthless” techniques previously used to quell anti-government protests in Hong Kong. “In such a fragile, volatile country Chinese policing techniques and tactics that we’ve seen deployed so ruthlessly in Hong Kong, for example, are completely inconsistent with the Pacific way of resolving issues and could incite further instability and violence in the Solomon Islands,” said Andrew Shearer, the director general of the Office of National Intelligence, who travelled to the Pacific islands nation in March in a failed attempt to persuade Sogavare not to sign the agreement. The text of the security deal, which was signed last week, has been kept secret, with Sogavare saying he will only release it with China’s permission, something that has alarmed Solomons MPs who have called for it to be made public. A leaked draft of the deal detailed broad conditions under which Solomon Islands could call upon China for armed police and military personnel, including “to assist in maintaining social order, protecting people’s lives and property, providing humanitarian assistance, carrying out disaster response, or providing assistance on other tasks agreed upon by the parties [to the agreement]”. Talifilu was speaking as he accompanied Suidani on a tour of Malaita, which is home to roughly a quarter of Solomon Islands’ population. There are tensions between the national government and Malaita, which has serious economic challenges and does not feel it has received adequate support from the national government to address them. Malaita did not support the Sogavare government’s decision in 2019 to switch diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China. Unhappiness with Sogavare over the switch was part of the motivation for riots in Honiara in 2021. Talifilu said that during the tour, many people across the province had raised the issue of the China security deal. “People ask about it,” he said. “And they are fearful to be honest … It’s a big discussion in communities, wanting to know how is this going to affect us.” Talifilu said the fears boiled down to two things: firstly that in the event of hostilities between the US and China, “we will be caught in the conflict”. Secondly, the prime minister’s ability to call on the Chinese for support to deal with internal security issues was seen as targeted at Malaita, given the historical tensions. “It’s known that Malaita province stood against China coming into our province … so they know that the emphasis on security, internal security, is an emphasis against Malaita,” he said. “So if it so happens that the Chinese are in Honiara or are invited to do things, it will be against Malaitans.” These concerns were echoed by the opposition leader Matthew Wale, who told the Guardian: “I think the deal is targeted at Malaita and that’s also the perception on Malaita. “So that is a real threat to the unity of this country and certainly internal stability.” Talifilu said that it was understandable that foreign countries like Australia had focused on the prospect of a Chinese naval base being built on Solomon Islands. He warned that while Sogavare had repeatedly said there would be no Chinese military base, the assurances should not be trusted, as the prime minister had “not been truthful” in the past, including in the lead-up to the change in diplomatic allegiance in 2019. “He promised people, including foreign governments, before any switch that there would be thorough consultations and that includes reports from within government to inform the government of the pros and cons or the switch from Republic of China to PRC. He ended up not doing that. So those experiences for me have taught me that this man is the kind of person that you can’t trust. “It’s fair to say that people should be worried. Why? Because why should we trust him now?” Sogavare, prime minister of Solomon Islands, was contacted for comment.",News/World news,"Solomons PM could use Chinese police to stay in power, key official fears",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/solomons-pm-could-use-chinese-police-to-stay-in-power-key-official-fears
4/28/2022,"Vladimir Putin has warned any countries attempting to interfere in Ukraine would be met with a “lightning-fast” response from Moscow. In an address to lawmakers in St Petersburg, the Russian president said troops would use “all the tools for this — ones that no one can brag about”. The crisis in Ukraine must be the “catalyst for change” to overhaul the west’s approach to international security, the UK’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said. Truss described Putin, as a “desperate rogue operator with no interest in international norms” and called upon the west to “dig deep” into its weapons inventories. “We’ve got to double down on our support for Ukraine,” she said. The UK is “digging deep” into its inventories, including heavy weapons, tanks and aeroplanes, to defend Ukraine and other countries threatened by Russia, Truss added. “Some argue we shouldn’t provide heavy weapons for fear of provoking something worse. But my view, is that inaction would be the greatest provocation,” she said. The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, has arrived in Ukraine after meeting Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Moscow. Guterres will meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, on Thursday. Russia has warned other EU customers may be cut off from Russian natural gas supplies if they refuse to pay in roubles. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov’s comments came after Russia halted gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, a move that European leaders denounced as “blackmail”, which the Kremlin later denied. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, described Russia’s move as “a direct attack” on Poland. The White House denounced Russia’s move to cut off energy supplies to Poland and Bulgaria. Press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at a daily briefing on Wednesday: “Unfortunately this is the type of step, the type of almost weaponising energy supplies that we had predicted that Russia could take in this conflict.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy described Russia’s actions as amounting to “energy blackmail” against Europe in his nightly national address. Zelenskiy said Russia’s decision to cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria shows “no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic cooperation with Russia”. A Ukrainian commander in the besieged city of Mariupol said there are more than 600 injured civilians and fighters in the Azovstal steel works. Serhiy Volyna, acting commander of the 36th marine brigade, said hundreds of civilians including children were living in unsanitary conditions and running out of food and water. Officials earlier said Russian forces were again attacking the huge steel plant. The interior ministry of Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria issued a statement claiming it came under attack from Ukraine. It said drones were spotted and shots were fired near Kolbasna, which it claims contains one of the largest ammunition dumps in Europe. A former head of the Polish army has accused Boris Johnson of “tempting evil” by revealing that Ukrainian soldiers were being trained in Poland in how to use British anti-aircraft missiles before returning with them to Ukraine. Gen Waldemar Skrzypczak complained that a loose-lipped PM had revealed too much to the Russians and that his remarks risked the safety of the soldiers involved. The European Commission has proposed suspending import duties on all Ukrainian products to help the country’s economy during the war with Russia. The proposed one-year suspension, which would need to be approved by the European Parliament and its 27 member states, comes a day after Britain announced it was dropping all tariffs on Ukrainian goods. Russia’s foreign ministry announced sanctions on 287 members of Britain’s House of Commons, accusing them of “whipping up Russophobic hysteria”. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said those members who had been hit with sanctions by Russia should regard it as “a badge of honour”. A top executive at one of Russia’s largest private banks said he has quit his post and fled to Kyiv to fight for Ukraine. In an interview with the independent Russian news outlet The Insider, Ukrainian-born Igor Volobuev, vice president of Gazprombank, said he “could no longer be in Russia” and that he wants to “wash off” his Russian past. Two American volunteers fighting in Ukraine were reportedly wounded by artillery fire near the city of Orikhiv in the Zaporizhzhia region. US army veterans Manus McCaffrey and Paul Gray were working together as a team targeting Russian tanks with Javelin anti-tank systems when they were injured, according to reports. The total losses inflicted upon Ukraine from the war have reached $600bn, Zelenskiy said. “More than 32m square metres of living space, more than 1,500 educational facilities and more than 350 medical facilities have been destroyed or damaged,” he added. “About 2,500km of roads and almost 300 bridges have been ruined or damaged.”",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 64 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-64-of-the-invasion
