2/4/2022,"Prominent Sydney barrister Cameron Murphy, has knocked back an approach from Labor to run for the key marginal seat of Parramatta, as branch members demand the party allow a rank and file ballot go ahead. Amid preselection turmoil for the Liberal party in NSW, Labor is yet to secure candidates in just two key seats – the western Sydney seat of Parramatta and the Wollongong seat of Cunningham.  While Cunningham will go to a rank and file ballot on 19 February, the process for endorsing a candidate in Parramatta remains unresolved, with the dominant socialist left faction considering overriding the local branches that are controlled by the soft, or “Ferguson” left. Murphy, the son of former high court justice and Whitlam government attorney general Lionel Murphy, is understood to have been approached by Albanese’s left faction, but he was unable to run because of family reasons. The ongoing threat of federal intervention in the seat is fuelling frustration among branch members, with the seat’s federal electoral committee (FEC) passing two separate motions calling for a rank and file ballot after the sitting MP Julie Owens’ resignation. The secretary of the Parramatta FEC, James Shaw, has written to Albanese and the NSW general secretary, Bob Nanva, demanding a rank and file ballot. In letters sent to Nanva and Albanese – first in October last year, and again this week – Shaw advised that members had passed a motion saying that branch members “strongly feel that we need a grassroots candidate with a profile in the community.” “The FEC needs to set a timetable for fundraising and campaigning. Furthermore we note that the seat of Parramatta is crucial for Labor to win government.” The letter also said branch members “express disappointment” that earlier correspondence requesting a ballot was not responded to. Shaw told Guardian Australia that branch members felt that a local candidate was needed, and that there were up to 40 booths in the seat that would require the resources of the branch. “Branch members will be extremely disheartened if we are not afforded our democratic right to determine the candidate,” he said. “We need a candidate who has grassroots connections to our area and who is answerable to party members and the Parramatta community.” Support from the Ferguson left, which is named after powerbroker Laurie Ferguson, is understood to be split between Granville state Labor MP Julia Finn, and Durga Owen, who ran for the state seat of Seven Hills at the last state election. The federal executive are considering installing Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union legal director, Abha Devasia, but branch members are concerned that she does not live in the seat is largely unknown in the community. It has been reported that Albanese had earlier approached the former state MP David Borger for the seat, but he knocked back the approach. Liverpool city councillor Charishma Kaliyanda has also been named as a possible candidate, but she is understood to have told local members she would not be nominating. The diverse western Sydney seat has been in Labor hands since 2004, and is held by a 3.5% margin. In her valedictory speech to parliament, Owens said branch members were best placed to choose her successor and they took the role “very seriously”. “They’ve been out there for years getting to know who in their ranks knows how to work, who is consistent, who is honest, who volunteers, who genuinely cares about the community, who has flaws that would negatively impact on their job, they staff the booths, they do it all and they know the branch members, they know each other very, very well. “They are well placed to make a decision about who will represent Labor in the forthcoming election.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But party figures say that the seat carries baggage linked to historical branch stacking, pointing to the findings of an internal inquiry completed by Evan Moorhead in 2020 which recommended a two-year pause on rank and file ballots. The Moorhead report found seven party officials had engaged in “unworthy conduct” by engaging in branch stacking with membership books routinely falsified. It is understood the left faction is now considering whether it is worth bearing the consequences of a backlash from the local branches in order to install a preferred candidate, or whether to allow the preselection to go ahead to ensure the branch members are kept on board.",News/Australia news,Prominent Sydney barrister knocks back run for key federal Labor seat,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/04/prominent-sydney-barrister-knocks-back-run-for-key-federal-labor-seat
2/4/2022,"Ten years ago, I knew I was with the love of my life for a short but intense year, but chose to end it. He cared for me, but for him it was more casual and there were clear reasons why it couldn’t be long term. I needed to be the one to end that first love, not wait for it to be taken away. Now I am happily settled with a loving, stable husband with young children, and yet I think of that first love sometimes and huge feelings still bubble up. Being with him transformed me, uncovered the best version of myself: more intelligent, beautiful, creative than I had ever been before – it matched the magic I saw in him. I overcame big obstacles in my life while we were together. Now I’m back to the me I recognise – heavy, cowardly, full of self-loathing.  I don’t know how to tell if I threw away one of the most important people or if this is just nostalgia gone wild. I cut contact with him when we split because I can’t bear the thought of hurting my husband, and don’t trust myself to deal with ambiguity. Should I leave it be? Will it forever hold me in its sway? Eleanor says: You know those lyrics by the Whitlams: “There’s no aphrodisiac like loneliness”? I think there’s no aphrodisiac like memory. Nostalgia gilds things. It paints old moments with a flush of promise. If we’re not careful it can lead us to perpetual distraction; keep us looking away from the present and back at something that seems to grow more beautiful the more it recedes into the past. You describe something pretty magical in this prior relationship. The love of your life; the best version of yourself you can remember being. But equally, as you note, it’s very hard to tell when that feeling is a mirage. So often when we daydream of a past – whether it’s a relationship or a place or just youth – it’s not the thing we’re longing for, but the feelings we had at the time: the sense that things were crackling and the future was open. That’s why I don’t think the questions here are quite the ones you’re asking. This is not about whether you threw away someone really important, or whether to let this past relationship be. Instead I think the question is how you can find the feelings you long for in your present life. How can you rediscover that sense of creativity, passion, confidence, inside the reality you now inhabit? After all, from your husband’s point of view, the fact you don’t speak to your past love isn’t totally comforting if his memory still has this passionate grip on your heart. No one wants to play the stable reality to the intoxicating fantasy; no one wants to be the one that didn’t get away. If you want to stay married – and it sounds like you do – I think it’s important not to measure your life together by comparing it to something else. It’s important to meet it and measure it on its own terms; to find a way to thrill in what you have as much as in what could have been. You describe your marriage as stable and loving; try not to erode it with comparisons. One key might be to realise that the feelings your past love gave you couldn’t have been manufactured by him alone. It takes two to make a dynamic – if you felt bold and invigorated with him, it’s because you have it within you to be that way. You now know that you can face up to big obstacles in your life, that you can see the magic in yourself and those around you. Different people bring different traits out of us, but we don’t need to rely on others for that alchemy. Part of that dynamic was you; and you’re with you wherever you are. You write that you ended this relationship and married your husband for reasons you still stand by. It’s an annoying feature of choices that making one always means declining another, so we can always wonder how things might have been. But imagining alternatives can keep us from building realities – if you can focus on bringing yourself the feelings this other man brought out of you, you might find he starts to shrink in your mind. That would free you up to love the reality in front of you more wholeheartedly, and in the end that’s the way out of all nostalgia: to cherish what we have with the same passion we give to fantasies of what we’ve lost.

2/4/2022,"Amazon’s profits surged to $14.32bn in a fourth quarter marked by record holiday sales, the company said in its earnings report on Thursday, while also announcing an increase in the price of Amazon Prime membership to help compensate for rising operating costs. In the three months ending in December 2021, sales for the e-commerce giant were up 24% from a sluggish third quarter to $137.4bn. Sales are also up 9% year-over-year from the same period in 2020.  The fourth quarter includes the holiday shopping season, a crucial period for retail. According to its quarterly report, Amazon had its most lucrative Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend this year. And “between Black Friday and Christmas, US-based third-party sellers sold an average of 11,500 products per minute”, the company announced it its earnings release. But the company is still feeling some of the effects of a battered supply chain and has increased wages to attract and retain its sprawling workforce in the tight labor market. In September, Amazon upped its average starting wage again to $18 an hour, and began including signing bonuses to entice hourly workers. “Lost productivity and network disruptions were driven primarily by labor capacity constraints due to challenges in staffing up our facilities for peak,” Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said in an earnings call on Thursday, referring to the busy holiday season. “This was driven by the very tight labor market in the second half of 2021, and more recently by the emergence of the Omicron variant. We do expect these cost challenges to persist into Q1, albeit adjusted for lower seasonal volumes relative to the fourth quarter.” To compensate, the company is turning up the dial on one of its most successful revenue streams. The price of an annual Amazon Prime subscription will increase from $119 to $139 this month to account for the “rise in wages and transportation costs,” according to the company. For new Prime members, this change will go into effect on February 18, and after March 25 for existing members. Amazon remains one of the biggest winners of the past few years as consumer spending shifted to e-commerce during the pandemic. The company had its two most profitable quarters in the past two years. This turnaround comes after a difficult third quarter for the company. Last quarter, Amazon reported a substantial profit decline – its largest in four years. Amazon blamed pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions and staffing issues for the drop – from $6.3bn to $3.2bn – which resulted in higher labor costs and spending on logistics investments, like warehouses and infrastructure. Amazon is the second-largest private employer in the US with nearly a million workers. As some of the US’s most profitable companies have taken a beating, Amazon’s success contrasts with a shocking result from fellow giant Meta yesterday. The social networking giant’s profits decreased 8 percent from last year, to $10.3bn. This was mostly fueled by increased spending on hardware investments toward the “metaverse” – the virtual reality-based version of the internet Mark Zuckerberg envisions – which totaled $10bn. More surprising, the number of Facebook users declined for the very first time. This confirms the warning calls from internal documents made public by whistleblower Frances Haugen last year, one of which revealed that “engagement is declining for teens in most western, and several non-western, countries”. Until now, the company has managed to grow its user base consistently for years, despite scandals and controversy. In response to the earnings report, shares in Meta dropped 25%.",News/Technology,Amazon profits surge as company announces cost increase to Prime membership,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/03/amazon-profits-surge-cost-increase-prime-membership
2/4/2022,"Hello, and congratulations to all those who have made it through their first weeks back at work or school. Welcome to Five Great Reads, your summertime, morning tea wrap of brilliant writing and insightful analysis, selected by me, Alyx Gorman, Guardian Australia’s lifestyle editor. Today we have a moving tribute to a life lost to Covid-19, and explainers on some of the week’s big news stories. What we do not have is breaking news; the live blog has that. Meanwhile, if you just want a feelgood break this weekend, may I suggest you watch Palm Springs?  Now, onto the reads. A clotheshorse with a great fondness for big pearls and bright colours, Sue Rees was kind and playful. She loved musical theatre and acted as the flower girl at her own daughter’s wedding. A cancer patient and a survivor, she checked into hospital for a burst eardrum – then the Omicron wave claimed her life. Notable quote: “It feels heartless and faceless for all of the victims when [other victims] have stories given to them, photos shown of them, they were memorialised, they were remembered,” says Sue’s daughter Bec. “These Covid victims had a face and a story, and right now they’re just a statistic.” Further reading: This piece is the latest in our series Lives Lost to Covid, which aims to share the stories and faces behind the numbers. Those numbers are crucial, “but it is important that human stories are not diminished or obscured by the numbers.” writes Guardian Australia’s editor in chief Lenore Taylor. “Stories inspire compassion. They force decision makers to take responsibility.” Further listening: On today’s Full Story podcast, listen to Lenore Taylor discuss the difficulties we face when confronting Covid-19’s human toll, with Gabrielle Jackson. The United States is Israel’s most important ally, providing the Jewish state vast sums of mostly military aid (the largest given to any foreign nation). But even before the publication of Amnesty International’s report this week, which declared Israel’s treatment of Palestinians an apartheid, public and political approval for the close relationship was declining. Notable quote: “People can see for themselves what’s happening in a way they didn’t before,” says Sarah Leah Whitson, the former director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East division. “It’s made it harder, particularly in the United States, for the emotional defenders of Israel, who’ve had this mythology about Israel … confronted with the reality of what they see in front of their faces.” How long will it take me to read?

However, for fear of stigma and discrimination, many of these specialists have not disclosed their autism status to colleagues. Background fact: In the United Kingdom, only 22% of autistic adults are in paid employment. For those who do work, the pressures to mask their neurodiversity, and adapt to environments that can feel hostile, leads to significant stress. Notable quote: Steph Jones, who has chosen to publicly disclose her autism status for the first time in this piece, is a psychotherapist who has mirror-touch synaesthesia, which allows her to vicariously experience the emotional and physical sensations of those around her. It is an invaluable asset as a clinician, she says. “Once I explain what it is [to clients] and it makes rational sense to them – rather than it seeming frightening or paranormal – they usually feel completely elated that someone gets them on that kind of deep level.” How long will it take me to read?

2/4/2022,"Zach Smith never expected the song to go so viral. On 4 January, the 19-year-old pressed play on an old track he found in his car; he was struck by how catchy it was – he’d never heard this song before.  When he discovered it had been written and recorded by his own father almost half a century earlier, he had to share it with his followers on TikTok. “There’s a horn section! Just wait … It’s so good!” the Arizona State University student exclaims in the video recorded the next day, miming the keyboard riffs and brain explosions as he rocks out in his car. “And he never released it! I’m so mad at him.” A musician himself, Zach would regularly share his work and what he’s listening to with his followers – which before this post amounted to about 10,000. So he didn’t think much of it when he uploaded the video before he went to bed. By the time he woke up, the track, titled Surrender to Me, had been played thousands of times. Almost as many people begged for it to be released in the comments. “I woke up to texts from people I never get texts from – like my hairstylist – saying, ‘Yo, this is crazy!’,” Zach tells the Guardian.

Within days, Herman Li and Meghan Trainor had voiced their love of the disco earworm in the comments, and Anthony Fantano – dubbed “the only music critic that matters” by the New York Times – called it “a banger”. In the weeks since, it has racked up 3m plays and counting, as well as close to 10,000 pre-saves and hundreds of duets, stitches, covers and remixes. And today the song finally got an official release, under the moniker FireCityFunk. When the Guardian meets them over Zoom, Zach and his father – William “Curly” Smith – are in festive spirits. They’re in Las Vegas to celebrate Curly’s birthday. He’s decked out in a captain’s hat and loud shirt, every part the 1970s rocker; his son is sitting next to him in considerably more casual attire, excited to share his dad’s story with the world. “It’s just something that’s been sitting on the shelf for 43 years,” Curly says. “[Zach] just discovered it in the car, did a TikTok thing on it, and the rest is history.” Zach kept his father’s identity under wraps until release day, leading some to speculate the wholesome story was merely a ruse to raise Zach’s own clout online. Zach laughs at this skepticism: “He’s a real person – see? But his dad is also a real musician: Curly Smith has recorded, sessioned and toured with the likes of Boston, Jo Jo Gunne, Steve Ray Vaughan, Belinda Carlisle and Willie Nelson. That’s why the existence of Surrender to Me didn’t come as a surprise; what caught Zach off-guard was the funk-R&B style. That and the fact it had never come out. “I was astonished, like everyone else on TikTok, that [the song] didn’t have the recognition I thought it deserved,” Zach explains. As one commenter noted, Surrender to Me was “a classic hit in an alternate timeline”. This article includes content provided by TikTok.

Within three weeks of the original post, Zach and William were in the studio used by the band Chicago (through one of Williams’ connections), getting the remastered recordings up to scratch for streaming. After dozens of followers suggested it would be a perfect addition to the disco-influenced Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack, some edited it into the film’s opening credits – and tagged Disney and Marvel in Zach’s updates. It worked. Ten days after the initial upload, Marvel’s music supervisor, Dave Jordan, reached out to Jack, saying he’d put the song in front of the Guardians director, James Gunn. There’s no promises, but it’s good timing, given filming for the third instalment of the franchise is under way. “We’re huge Marvel fans,” Zach says. “We’ve seen all the MCU movies. It’s something we’ve bonded over as father and son, so it’s really exciting to think the song could end up in one of the films.” This article includes content provided by TikTok.

2/4/2022,"Christian Eriksen’s return to Premier League football with Brentford will take a “few weeks”, according to Thomas Frank. The manager said his Danish compatriot, while physically capable, may need that time to gain match fitness and mental readiness.  Eriksen is coming back from the cardiac arrest suffered while playing at last year’s Euro 2020 tournament. Frank hopes to revive the career of a player he worked with at youth level and believes Eriksen can be “potentially the greatest signing” in Brentford’s history. “What happened to him in June was crazy, a shock for us all,” Frank said. “So to see him out on the pitch is going to be a big day. I am glad that Christian and his family are fine and comfortable with him playing football again.” Eriksen’s contract until the end of the season was confirmed on Monday, Internazionale having released him because Serie A clubs are not allowed to field players with the cardioverter-defibrillator he now has implanted. The 29-year-old former Tottenham and Ajax player has ambitions to play at the 2022 World Cup and has trained with Jong Ajax and the third-tier Swiss club FC Chiasso. “Christian will arrive on Sunday, and he will train with the team on Monday,” said Frank. “[He] has a solid physical foundation and has been doing all sorts of tests. He has been running a lot, training a lot, so he has done quite a lot over the last few months so his foundation is fine, but another thing is to get up to match speed. “It is hard to say when he is available. I will know a lot more after Monday. I hope weeks, a few weeks, but I don’t know. I am much more clever when I have seen him train.” Frank said he was unconcerned by the perceived risk Eriksen may be taking or the presence of the implant. “I am not a doctor, but the specialists that have seen him and met him and tested him know that everything is perfect,” he said. “I know Christian and his family will not take the slightest risk that something could happen if he is training or playing a football match. For me it is down to the mental part of it, down to getting back to the rhythm, playing football at a top, top level.” Eriksen chose to return to the city he played in from 2013 to 2020 with Spurs. “With this crazy experience he chose to do something he knows: the Premier League, London, a club where he knows some of his teammates, and he has a connection to me,” said Frank. “Imagine speaking to our fans when we were in League One and saying we would be in the Premier League in six or seven years’ time and he would be playing for Brentford. It is a little miracle.”",Sport/Football,"Christian Eriksen can be Brentford’s ‘greatest signing’, claims Thomas Frank",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/03/christian-eriksen-can-be-brentfords-greatest-signing-claims-thomas-frank
2/4/2022,"Frank Lampard has admitted he has a point to prove at Everton and that he did not seek assurances over job security from Farhad Moshiri during talks to become the club’s sixth permanent manager in six years. Lampard ended 12 months out of the game on Monday when he was appointed by Everton on a two-and-a-half year contract. During an assured first press conference on Thursday, the 43-year-old said his new role “gets my juices flowing” and that his preferred style of play fitted neatly with the club’s traditions. But after being sacked by Chelsea – “one bad month and you lose your job,” as he described it – Lampard accepts his managerial credentials will be questioned as he attempts to haul Everton out of relegation trouble.  “It’s the world we live in,” he said. “I guess if you decide to be the manager of a football club, particularly in the Premier League, you are not going to cruise through your career without having points to prove at various different times. Even the absolute best – the most successful – have that, so I have got no issue with that. As a player, I found I had a point to prove at various different times; sometimes it brings the best out of you and I hope it does with me.” Moshiri, Everton’s majority shareholder, has overseen lavish spending and managerial churn since his arrival in 2016, leading to recent fan protests over how the club is run. Lampard, however, does not consider Everton or the task he has inherited from Rafael Benítez as a risk, and admits he did not ask for long-term stability from Moshiri because results will determine his future. “I don’t want to talk about private conversations but I don’t sit here craving time in terms of a two or three-year vision,” said Lampard, who has added Ashley Cole to his backroom team as first-team coach. “I know it is very nice to talk about the new stadium and where we want to be in the next few years, but what I have learned from being in football and being at Chelsea is that you just need to get your head down and work. “I am at the start of something now, and I certainly haven’t asked for any assurances to that point. I will be as good as what impression I can have on this team and this squad. I will be as good as the style and the way of playing can be enjoyed by the fans. I will be particularly as good as the results we can produce in the short term and, hopefully, the long term. There are ‘maybes’ and ‘ifs’ but it is not worth getting involved with them. I’m in a great job and I am very proud to be here. Now is just the time to work.” Despite the team’s Premier League position, fan unrest and erratic ownership, Lampard says he had no misgivings. “I took it as I found, and that is the only way. I have found an owner, a chairman and a board that, from my first conversation, the one thing that was clear was that they want to find the best way to take this club forward. They are very united. I know there have been some difficult times but it is not my job to look over those. I only want to look at the future. “I grew up with Everton being an incredible team in the mid-80s. I remember the team and the size of the club and I remember coming here to play, and feeling the atmosphere. Those things are the big pull. To manage a club with such a fan base, such a tradition, and the idea that I could give them back something they want, that is the thing that gets my juices flowing.” Lampard’s first game will be at home to Brentford in the FA Cup on Saturdaytomorrow. He then faces a critical Premier League test three days later at Newcastle, who trail Everton by four points. “I hope to bring an exciting brand of football,” he said. “There are some basic fundamentals that an Everton team needs to have, and I hope to bring those too. When I think of an Everton atmosphere, from playing against it, it’s a team that loves to see crosses and pressure and second balls, shots and combinations and things done at speed, and a team that wants to run and a team that wants to press high up the pitch. Those things absolutely align with my philosophy.”",Sport/Football,Frank Lampard has not asked Everton for assurances over long-term security,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/03/frank-lampard-everton-manager-chelsea-premier-league
