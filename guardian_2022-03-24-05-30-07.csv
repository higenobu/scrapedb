3/24/2022,"She is an Afro-Colombian environmental crusader who has faced down untold death threats and survived at least one assassination attempt to become one of the leading lights of Latin America’s new left. Now, Francia Márquez, 40, could be on the verge of becoming Colombia’s next vice-president after the leftist frontrunner, Gustavo Petro, picked her as his running mate – a move that has thrilled progressives and civil rights activists across the region. “How could I not cry, if I represent the black women of this country?” said Márquez, after receiving the nomination on Wednesday morning. “Every Colombian, in their diversity, from the regions, from each territory, made it possible for us to be here,” said Márquez, who, if elected in the 29 May vote, would join Costa Rica’s Epsy Campbell Barr as one of only two black female vice-presidents in Latin America. “I thank the people that have remained in resistance for life, peace and social justice,” she added, vowing to fight “for the ‘nobodys’ of this country”. A law student and mother of two, Márquez comes from the war-torn western department of Cauca, where her outspoken opposition to illegal gold-mining mafias led to death threats that forced her to flee her home. She later led a 10-day, 350-mile march of 80 women from the Amazon to Bogotá that prompted the government to send troops to remove the miners and put an end to the cyanide and mercury contamination they caused. In 2018, she was awarded the prestigious Goldman environmental prize for her campaigning. Márquez’s selection as the running mate of a serious presidential hopeful breaks the mould in Colombia, where since independence, politics has been dominated by wealthy white men. Afro-Colombians make up nearly 10% of Colombia’s population of 50 million, descending from enslaved people brought from Africa to work on sugar cane plantations, goldmines and the large estates of landowning Spanish colonists. They remain under-represented in business and politics. “As someone from a group that has been historically discriminated against by the systems of power in Colombia, I’m incredibly happy,” said Yacila Bondo, a young Afro-Colombian activist. “Just for her to be named as candidate for vice-president is historic.” “Just a few years ago it was unimaginable, and when she announced her campaign, people laughed,” Bondo went on to say. “This is going to open so many doors in our social imagination, and we’ll see more black women and girls going into politics.” Márquez was chosen as Petro’s running mate after winning over 750,000 votes in a primary earlier this month. Both belong to the leftist Historic Pact coalition, which is largely made up of anti-establishment politicians and many political newcomers. “As well as being a black woman, a mother and head of her household, and a victim of the conflict, she also bridges the rural-urban divide in Colombia,” said Sergio Guzmán, director of Colombia Risk Analysis, a local consultancy. “The only doubt about her before was whether she could get votes, which after the primary we know she can.” “We are not one and another, we are one and one, a team working for Colombia,” said Petro, who is battling to become the country’s first ever leftist president. Petro, who as a youth was a member of the now-defunct M-19 guerrilla group, has served as mayor of Bogotá, the capital city, and came second in the last presidential election in 2018. His main rival this year will be Federico Gutiérrez, the former mayor of Medellín, Colombia’s second city, who is widely seen as representing the centre-right status quo. Colombia has never had a president from the left. Also on the ballot will be Colombia’s fragile peace process with the leftist rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), who demobilised after a peace deal was signed in 2016, ending decades of civil war that killed over 260,000 and displaced seven million. State forces and their paramilitary allies contributed to the violence. Petro is viewed as a fervent supporter of the deal, while Gutiérrez is thought to be a skeptic.",News/World news,Colombia could elect first black female vice-president as poll leader names pick,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/colombia-francia-marquez-first-black-female-vice-president-candidate
3/24/2022,"Good morning. Madeleine Albright, the first woman to serve as US secretary of state, has died, aged 84. “We are heartbroken to announce that Dr Madeleine Albright, the 64th US secretary of state and the first woman to hold that position, passed away earlier today,” a statement posted on her Twitter account read. In Australia, prime minister Scott Morrison is set to visit Victoria, and defence minister Peter Dutton is due to make an announcement regarding funding for defence bases nationwide. The US has concluded that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine based on its assessment of evidence that civilians have been deliberately targeted. “Russia’s forces have destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centres, and ambulances, leaving thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded,” the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said in a statement. Meanwhile, Nato countries are expected to agree to provide special kit to protect Ukraine against any chemical, biological or nuclear attacks launched by Russia. The Morrison government has allocated $5.9bn to build two separate north Queensland dams without seeking any input from an advisory board it established less than two years ago to scrutinise major water projects. Commitments to fund the Hells Gates and the Urannah dams have been made in the past week, but Guardian Australia has confirmed that neither dam proposal was subjected to any formal scrutiny from the National Water Grid Advisory Body. Serious questions have been raised about the economic benefits of the Urannah project and the detailed business case for the Hells Gates project is still under development.Regional movie events in 2019 that attracted just 137 viewers were set to feature then-deputy prime minister Michael McCormack spruiking infrastructure spending. But his message was scrapped after the finance department advised that his inclusion in the campaign “does raise some concerns”. Created for an “objective” infrastructure campaign, the videos featured a cheery McCormack spruiking federal government spending. They were to be played before free movies in a taxpayer-funded roadshow through regional cities to promote the Building our Future package in 2019, ahead of the May election. The roadshow cost taxpayers of $353,730 – about $2,500 per attendee. McCormack told Guardian Australia if “bureaucrats” canned the videos then “so be it” but there was “nothing untoward” and “nothing unusual” about his participation in them. The largest refugee crisis since the second world war has prompted Australians to travel overseas and offer assistance to those fleeing Ukraine, offering help from translation services to van rides. Politicians routinely dismiss allegations of bullying made by women by painting it as just the “cost of doing politics” or as something that happens to men just as much, new research has found. A UN mission to see if the Great Barrier Reef should be put on an “in danger” list will not get “the whole picture” unless it visits reefs currently experiencing coral bleaching, conservationists and the government’s own reef envoy have said. Renters in flood-affected Queensland properties have just days left to negotiate a lease break under laws that allow the move within one month of a natural disaster. But with rental properties in short supply, many tenants are facing the difficult decision of whether to stay or go. Telstra has defended its flood response in NSW, saying large-scale and lengthy outages were inevitable once rivers cut off electricity or flooded base stations. But critics say Telstra should have done a better job of keeping the public informed about efforts to restore services.

Easter Monday will mark seven weeks since floods swept through much of the NSW’s northern rivers region. The question for thousands of potential holidaymakers to Byron Bay and beyond is now pressing: to go or not to go?

3/24/2022,"Adouble-bill in the Dance Reflections festival unintentionally pairs two pieces in which you feel the minutes very slowly passing. In Boris Charmatz’s Infini, the performers themselves are tracking those passing moments. A dancer’s life is soundtracked by counts, but these dancers are on a journey way past “5-6-7-8”. They count out numbers from the smallest fractions towards infinity, rising and falling, doubling back and changing direction like an Escher staircase. The digits resonate as ages, years, historical anniversaries, countdowns, counting sheep, and move towards anticipated climaxes, time racing and slowing. It’s all very clever, a feat of concentration for the performers who are also cavorting around in snatches of dance moves – from ballet to krump to playing an invisible violin – with a general air of absurdity. The experience of watching teeters between interesting and irritating; you can sometimes feel the sense of eternity the choreographer is exploring. A stage full of spinning flickering lights are physically difficult to watch. “Tiring,” said my friend. Later she amended herself: “Tiresome.” Serafine1369, AKA Jamila Johnson-Small, creates work for galleries (recently Tate Britain) where audiences can immerse themselves for a short time. In the theatre, it’s more like being held captive. A dimly lit stage, the sound of pelting rain, Johnson-Small and Fernanda Muñoz-Newsome alternately marking out movements on the spot, focus turned inward, listening to their insides. Among other things, When We Speak I Feel Myself, Opening is interested in the smallest sensory experiences, many invisible to the viewer. In gnomic fragments of blank-voiced narration, Johnson-Small recounts a piece of a dream, musings on the gaze, a few lyrics from East 17. The overall impression is one of numbness, but a numbness that covers a deep well of anger or pain. It’s a solipsistic investigation, but also tacitly railing against everything that’s wrong in the world. A piece of resistance, deliberately uninterested in connection; a manifesto with most of the pages missing. Johnson-Small is not playing the game, the dancers don’t even come back for a bow once they have left the stage. There’s something admirable about it all – you want to get inside Johnson-Small’s head, but you’re firmly shut out.",Arts/Stage,"Boris Charmatz / Serafine1369 review – resistance, endurance and an invisible violin",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/23/dance-reflections-festival-review-sadlers-wells-london
3/24/2022,"The spring statement did not deliver much to help Lesters, a small but growing packaging company struggling with rising costs. The Staffordshire-based firm’s energy bills will rise from £7,000 a month to £18,000 when the current contract runs out. Speaking after Rishi Sunak’s spring statement, Lesters’ managing director, Billy Hutchinson, said the chancellor had offered nothing to help on this key issue. “For us the assistance that is needed has not been addressed,” he said. The fuel duty reduction helps but “doesn’t really scratch the surface”, he added. The chancellor’s statement was met with a chorus of criticism from businesses and lobby groups complaining that Sunak had done little to alleviate levels of cost inflation steeper than anything faced by British businesses since the 1990s. “The chancellor put forward sticking-plaster measures that will do little to stem the pain of the rising cost of living,” said John Dickie, the chief executive of the lobby group London First. Carmakers, the food and drinks industry, the chemicals sector and manufacturers said the government could have done more. “The lack of action on energy costs for business is especially hard to fathom,” said Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of Make UK, a lobby group representing manufacturers. “Government cannot escape the fact that manufacturers are facing eye-watering cost increases that are pushing many towards a tipping point, and companies would have been looking for substantial business support measures to help alleviate these.” Pubs bosses said the failure to extend a cut in VAT to 12.5% for hospitality meant landlords faced more hardship just when they were looking to recover from the financial damage from the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns. Liz Hind, who took on the running of the Old Millwrights Arms pub in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire with her partner five years ago to the day of the spring statement, has endured one of the most difficult periods in history for the sector. Further rent increases on top of inflation in product prices have been the last straw, and she and her partner are planning to hand back their pub to the owners in two weeks’ time and look for jobs in hospitality management. There was “absolutely nothing” for pubs in the spring statement, she said. “It’s just not fun running a pub at the moment.” The trucking industry’s lobby group, the Road Haulage Association, welcomed the cut in fuel duty – which has been heavily criticised by environmental campaigners – but Rod McKenzie, the group’s executive director, said that his members still face “huge operating cost hikes”. Shevaun Haviland, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “The spring statement falls short of the action businesses needed to see today. While there are some positive announcements that firms will welcome, it did not fundamentally address the huge cost pressures they are facing.” She cited the increased employment allowance, a tax break for small businesses, as a small victory, but said it was a “missed opportunity”. The fuel duty cut was “just a drop in the ocean compared to the larger tsunami of surging costs that is bearing down on firms and households”, she added. Tony Danker, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, which represents many of the UK’s largest businesses, said there were some welcome “steps to sustain confidence in our economy” but they “don’t do enough to tackle the current challenges facing firms”. Promised changes to business investment incentives at the next budget were good news but “we cannot wait until October to get growth going”, Danker said.",News/UK news,"‘Sticking-plaster measures’: Sunak fails to ease pain of surging costs, say firms",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/23/sticking-plaster-measures-sunak-fails-to-ease-pain-of-surging-costs-say-firms
3/24/2022,"Jamaica’s prime minister has told the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge that his country is “moving on” and intends to become a republic. The royals’ arrival in Jamaica on Tuesday coincided with a much-publicised demonstration urging the monarchy to pay reparations for slavery, and calls from politicians for the country to become a republic. The couple’s visit to Jamaica has given the nation the opportunity to address “unresolved” issues, the prime minister, Andrew Holness, told them. During an official welcome, Holness said: “There are issues here which are, as you would know, unresolved but your presence gives an opportunity for those issues to be placed in context, put front and centre and to be addressed in as best [a way] as we can. “Jamaica is as you would see a country that is very proud of our history and very proud of what we have achieved. We are moving on and we intend to attain in short order … our goals and fulfil our true ambitions as an independent, developed, prosperous country.” Following the decision by Barbados to remove the Queen as head of state, Holness said last December, that “there is no question that Jamaica has to become a republic”. There has been bipartisan support for the move for years and the campaign to change Jamaica’s status is increasingly a mainstream position. Amid reports that a senior official has already been appointed to oversee the transition to a republic, polling experts say Jamaican public opinion has moved steadily in favour of becoming a republic over the past decade, fuelled by increasing discussion of the negative legacy of colonialism and by interest in the Black Lives Matter movement. Lisa Hanna, Jamaican’s opposition spokesperson on foreign affairs, said the last three years had led to a generation of Caribbean people who are “more self reflective, more socially conscious”, and the Windrush scandal was contributing to this. Watching how “our grandparents and great-grandparents” were being treated “gave us a sense of questioning and reckoning”, Hanna said. “It’s time we look at how we’ve given so much of ourselves to Great Britain.” Political pollster Don Anderson said only around 40% of Jamaicans supported separation from the monarchy in 2011, but in 2020 this had increased to 62%. “I’d be surprised if that number isn’t closer now to 70%, because of the increased calls for Jamaica to follow Barbados in becoming a republic,” he said. “There has also been an increased awareness of the atrocities of colonialism. I don’t think it was on people’s radar in the same way 10 years ago. I believe the government will be forced to respond to this very soon.” Campaigners this week published a document listing 60 reasons why the British government and royals should apologise to the Jamaican people and offer reparations, citing human trafficking and the transatlantic slave trade and the destruction of Jamaica’s natural environment by establishing a plantation system. An open letter addressed to Prince William and Kate, signed by 100 campaigners, which was delivered to the British high commission on Tuesday, noted that the Queen had “done nothing to redress or atone for the suffering of our ancestors that took place during her reign and during the entire period of British trafficking of Africans, enslavement and colonisation”. “You, who may one day lead the British monarchy, are direct beneficiaries of the wealth accumulated by the royal family over centuries, including that stemming from the trafficking and enslavement of Africans,” the letter said. “We urge you to start with an apology and recognition of the need for atonement and reparations.” Economics professor Rosalea Hamilton, who drafted the letter, said the royal visit was inadvertently “fast-tracking” the campaign to move to a republic. If Prince William failed to apologise and discuss reparations during the visit, the campaign would “surge ahead” and the move to a republic would become an inevitability, she said. Lawyer Jennifer Housen said people in Jamaica were increasingly wondering what the benefit was of continued ties with the UK, given that the UK requires Jamaican nationals to apply for visas before visiting (and makes these visas hard to secure) and that economic links were no longer significant. “How special are we when our nationals need a visa even to come to Britain? People feel the relationship is pointless.” The parallel campaign for payment of reparations for slavery from the British government has intensified in the past year. Culture minister Olivia Grange said this week: “Reparations will happen. It is about regaining our respect. It has to do with our dignity. It has to do with ensuring that the injustices that were meted out to our enslaved ancestors are corrected. We are on a mission, we have to achieve that goal.” Earlier this year, the Jamaican prime minister established a new ministry responsible for constitutional reform, having previously directed then attorney general Marlene Malahoo Forte to research the removal of the Queen as head of state. Philip Murphy, an expert on Commonwealth history and author of Monarchy and the End of Empire, said the royal family’s decision to visit Jamaica was having the unintended consequence of strengthening campaigns for Jamaica to drop its ties with the British monarchy. “Campaigners might not have got that kind of international attention without the presence of William and Kate. We seem to be reaching a tipping point where events that are clearly choreographed by the British government as a sort of charm offensive, banging the drum for global Britain, become a kind of shitstorm of controversy,” he said.",News/UK news,Jamaica’s PM tells Kate and William his country is ‘moving on’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/jamaicas-pm-tells-kate-and-william-his-country-is-moving-on
3/24/2022,"Boris Johnson was accused of “buffoonish” behaviour for chuckling and pulling a face while the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, spoke in the Commons of the terrifying ordeal faced by millions of Ukrainians. As Sunak began his spring statement, Johnson appeared to relax having just faced half an hour of prime minister’s questions. Sunak’s serious demeanour as he paid tribute to people fighting or sheltering from the Russian military appeared at odds with Johnson’s. For nearly 15 seconds, the prime minister chuckled at the opposition benches, his shoulder shaking with laughter. At one point, he appeared to pull a face, while the home secretary, Priti Patel, glowered at Labour MPs, seemingly disapproving of the amount of noise in the chamber. “As I stand here, men, women and children are huddled in basements across Ukraine seeking protection,” Sunak read from his notes, while Johnson smiled at his side. “Soldiers and citizens alike have taken up arms to defend their land and families.” A clip of the moment was shared widely on social media and viewed nearly 1.5m times. Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat MP, condemned the behaviour. She said: “It’s all a joke to Boris Johnson. His buffoonery is a national embarrassment. He should apologise to the people of Ukraine. Their bravery stands in great contrast to Johnson’s childish behaviour.” Johnson said later in the day that he had spoken to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and praised the country’s “steadfast resistance”. In a tweet, the prime minister added: “The UK stands with Ukraine – we will send further defensive aid and they have our full backing in the negotiations.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson accused of ‘buffoonery’ during Sunak remarks on Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/23/boris-johnson-accused-of-buffoonery-sunak-ukraine
3/24/2022,"Boris Johnson is expected to open the door to more onshore wind at next week’s energy strategy, despite some cabinet ministers lobbying against relaxing planning laws to allow more turbines. The cabinet is split over whether to aim for more onshore wind projects, which can often get into lengthy planning battles, after officials drew up plans for a target of 30GW by 2030. Ministers have not yet made a final decision but one senior government source said Johnson was “open minded” and “passionate” about offshore wind. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has made clear publicly that he would like to see planning rules relaxed in order to facilitate the building of more onshore windfarms. Michael Gove, who oversees the planning system, has also spoken in favour. However, one cabinet minister said that there should not be a rush towards onshore wind because it was “extremely expensive” and “not cost-effective”. Some are understood to prefer a push for fracking, despite safety and environmental concerns. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit opportunities minister, has publicly declared himself in favour exploiting more onshore gas in the UK. The energy independence plan was announced by the prime minister after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Set to be published next week after some delays, it is expected to propose a rapid expansion of nuclear power and accelerated targets for renewables – but it is unclear whether a relaxation of planning rules around onshore wind will be included. Officials have suggested targets of 16GW of nuclear by 2030, 50GW of offshore by 2030, and 50GW of solar by 2030, the Guardian understands. A Downing Street source said: “All options have to be on the table, given global price increases and the need to be self-sufficient – but nothing is decided yet.” David Cameron’s government tightened planning rules for onshore wind developments in 2014, requiring more local consultation. Sparked by grassroots Tory opposition from communities, which saw the turbines as an eyesore, the move has effectively acted as a moratorium. Eight members of Johnson’s cabinet – including Rees-Mogg, Steve Barclay, Brandon Lewis, Nadine Dorries, Nadhim Zahawi and Mark Spencer – were signatories to a 2012 letter opposing onshore wind, though a No 10 source said: “I wouldn’t read too much into that.” At the time, the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, said: “We need to ensure that protecting the local environment is properly considered alongside the broader issues of protecting the global environment.” Kwarteng has suggested the public’s opposition to windfarms has fallen away, given the push for net zero and the renewed interest in energy self-sufficiency since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “There were quite understandable political reasons that people didn’t want to see large-scale, onshore winds in their vicinity. I think that’s changed,” he told the i newspaper earlier this week. “I think the prime minister has been very clear that onshore wind has got to be part of the mix and we’ve got to look at planning.” He added: “The argument about onshore wind in 2015 was a historic argument even before we committed to net zero and the circumstances today with Putin. Russia, Saudi Arabia, all of those things mean that we’ve got to have more energy independence and I think onshore renewables are absolutely part of that.” When asked if the prime minister agreed with Kwarteng’s view, Johnson’s official spokesperson said on Tuesday: “I think the public has recognised the need to diversify our energy supply and the importance of having sustainable energy sources, which move away from the volatility we see from non-renewables.” Scotland has pushed ahead with onshore wind, with a more liberalised planning system, and is regarded in Whitehall as what one government source described as a “major success story”. The UK has announced that it is seeking to phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of 2022 and will also examine ending Russian gas imports. Johnson was previously sceptical about windfarms, writing in 2013 that they couldn’t “pull the skin off a rice pudding”. The shadow environment secretary, Ed Miliband, has argued that a “sprint” towards renewables, rather than investment in fracking, should be the government’s response to the crisis in Ukraine.",News/Environment,Johnson to defy cabinet fears and push for onshore wind expansion,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/23/johnson-to-defy-cabinet-fears-and-push-for-onshore-wind-expansion
3/24/2022,"Britain’s most vulnerable households will face the full force of the biggest squeeze on living standards on record after Rishi Sunak targeted better-off workers for help in his £9bn mini-budget package of tax and duty cuts. The chancellor responded to the highest inflation in three decades with a 5p-a-litre cut in fuel duty and a £3,000 increase in the threshold for national insurance contributions but faced immediate and widespread criticism for failing to shield pensioners and those dependent on state benefits from the impact of a cost-of-living crisis. In what he boasted was the biggest package of tax cuts in a quarter of a century, Sunak cut fuel duty by 5p a litre – taking prices back to their level of a week ago – and said the NI change would benefit the average worker by about £6 a week. In the most surprising move, the chancellor then announced a 1p cut in income tax to 19p, which will come into force in April 2024, the month before the day earmarked by the government for the general election. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the spring statement had given back only a sixth of the tax increases announced by Sunak during his two years as chancellor and that even after these measures, living standards would fall by more than 2% this year – what it said would be the steepest drop since records began in the 1950s. A snap poll carried out by YouGov on Wednesday suggested the public were underwhelmed by Sunak’s spring statement. Just 6% of people said he had done enough to tackle the cost of living crisis, while 69% felt he had not done enough. Living standards are expected to fall sharply as wages and state benefits fail to keep pace with rising prices. The Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday that the annual inflation rate had risen to 6.2% – its highest since 1992 – but the OBR said it was on course to hit levels not seen since the early 1980s later this year when sharply higher energy bills bite. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, said: “In the face of what the OBR calls the biggest hit to household finances since comparable records began in 1956-57 he has done nothing more for those dependent on benefits, the very poorest, besides a small amount of extra cash for local authorities to dispense at their discretion. Their benefits will rise by just 3.1% for the coming financial year. Their cost of living could well rise by 10%.” Despite slashing its growth forecast for 2022 from 6% to 3.8%, the OBR said borrowing in the current financial year would be £55bn lower than it had forecast last October. Government departments will also feel the squeeze from rising inflation – expected to peak at almost 9% this year – because the money allocated in last year’s spending round will not go as far. Sunak said he would double the government’s household support fund – a pot of cash allocated to local councils to help struggling families – to £1bn. Speaking on the second anniversary of the first pandemic lockdown, Sunak said the economic sanctions imposed on Russia would “not be cost free” and presented a risk to the recovery from Covid-19. Sara Ogilvie, the policy director of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: “Today the chancellor could have helped millions of families cope with spiralling costs – but instead he failed the children who needed him the most. The measures he announced don’t come close to bridging the gap between what the lowest income families have and what they need, and will leave many stranded in the face of the highest prices in a generation.” Phil Andrew, the chief executive of the debt charity StepChange, said: “The additional £500m to the household support fund is of course welcome, but a drop in the ocean in terms of addressing the scale of need among the most financially vulnerable households in the light of the dramatic rise in the cost of living. We are now really worried that there will be an increase in the number of households who simply won’t be able to make ends meet.” The Resolution Foundation thinktank said two out of every three pounds from the chancellor’s giveaways would go to those in the richest half of the population. The OBR warned households to be ready for a jump in the energy price cap from £1,971 to £2,800 a year in October. Sunak’s decision to lift the national insurance threshold followed months of pressure from cabinet colleagues and Tory backbenchers over April’s NICs increase, which they fear will be deeply unpopular with voters. After Wednesday’s statement, the Treasury pointed out that 70% of taxpayers will now not pay any more NICs when it comes into force. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, painted it as a partial U-turn, saying: “We said it was the wrong tax. Wrong time. Wrong choice. Today the chancellor all but admitted he got that one wrong.” She attacked Sunak for failing to grasp the scale of the hardship facing many people in the coming months. “Ordinary families, disabled people and pensioners are facing really difficult choices,” Reeves said. “Mums skipping meals so that their children don’t. Families struggling to buy new school shoes and uniforms for their children.” The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, called the statement the “Sunak swindle”, highlighting the fact that while the chancellor hailed his plans for tax cuts, the OBR’s analysis shows the overall tax burden is still set to rise. “People facing the biggest drop in living standards on record will see through the chancellor’s spin,” he said. Even the Centre for Social Justice, the thinktank co-founded by former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, highlighted the lack of help for the poorest families. “The reality is this cost of living crisis is just getting started – and today we needed to see a strategy for those struggling the most,” a CSJ spokesperson said. “Universal credit remains the best weapon in government’s arsenal to get support directly to those who will be worst hit by the spike in energy prices, while also helping claimants into work.” Sunak’s statement was enthusiastically welcomed by Conservative backbenchers, many of whom had been pressing him to give a timetable for future tax cuts. Former Brexit secretary David Davis said: “I am glad that Rishi Sunak has finally unveiled a road to cutting tax. I will look forward to standing alongside him and our party in 2024, on a platform that promises the first income tax cut in 16 years.”",News/UK news,UK’s most vulnerable face crunch as Rishi Sunak helps better-off ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/uk-cost-of-living-rishi-sunak-fuel-duty-income-tax-spring-statement
