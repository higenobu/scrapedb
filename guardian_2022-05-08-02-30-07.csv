5/8/2022,"A Biden administration official warned Friday that there could be 100m Covid-19 infections this fall and winter, potentially spurring a surge in hospitalizations and deaths. The White House is preparing backup plans for providing vaccines to US residents if lawmakers refuse to provide more funds for coronavirus response efforts, the New York Times reported. The White House has ramped up efforts to boost the country’s preparedness and urge Congress to allocate billions to buy additional vaccines, therapeutics and tests, but additional emergency funding is uncertain. Biden has requested $22.5bn for Covid-19; Republicans have pushed for just $10bn, however, and removed $5bn in international coronavirus assistance from this request, the Times said. The US coronavirus death toll is expected to reach 1m this week. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said last week that 60% of US residents have been infected with Covid-19, the Washington Post reported. The official’s dire projection was based on several models, not new data, and was not a formal prediction. These models operate with the premise that Omicron and its sub-variants will keep driving community transmission – and that a significantly different strain will not emerge, according to the Washington Post. This prediction was also made with the assumption that there will not be additional federal aid, the Times reported. The model also assumed that many vaccinated people, and persons who were previously infected, would get Covid-19 again. Several public health experts say that a dramatic wave during cold-weather months is possible, as immunity from vaccines declines over time. This drop in immunity comes amid variants that are more capable of evading immunity – and as officials continue to relax public health restrictions, the Post said. The officials projected that the surge would start in the south – where vaccination and booster rates lag – as more people congregate indoors. Authorities fear the uptick will tear through the supply of tests and anti-viral treatments, leaving the US ill-prepared to combat the fall and winter uptick, the Post said. On Friday, the seven-day US average of new infections totaled almost 71,000 – more than twice the 29,312 weekly average just five weeks ago. Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina’s school of global public health, told the Post: “What they’re saying seems reasonable – it’s on the pessimistic side of what we projected in the Covid-19 scenario modeling run.” “It’s always hard to predict the future when it comes to Covid, but I think we’re at a point now where it’s even harder than normal,” Lessler continued. “Because there’s so much sensitivity, in terms of these long-term trends, to things we don’t understand exactly about the virus and about [human] behavior.”",News/World news,"Potential Covid surge in fall and winter could lead to 100m infections, officials warn",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/covid-surge-fall-winter-biden-administration-warning
5/8/2022,"Brazil’s former leader Luiz Inació Lula da Silva has kickstarted what he hopes will be a sensational finale to one of Latin America’s most extraordinary political careers, publicly declaring his intention to challenge Jair Bolsonaro for the presidency and urging citizens to unite against the far-right populist’s “incompetence and authoritarianism”. Speaking at a rally in São Paulo, where the one-time lathe operator began his spectacular rise to power as a union leader more than four decades ago, Lula publicly spelled out his ambition to reclaim the presidency for the first time. “I am certain that we are going to manage to stage the greatest peaceful revolution the world has ever seen,” the 76-year-old leftist told thousands of supporters, who had gathered for the launch of what Lula called a cross-party anti-Bolsonaro alliance called Vamos Juntos Pelo Brasil, or Let’s Pull Together for Brazil. “We have a dream. We are moved by hope – and there is no force greater than the hope of a people who know they can be happy once more … Once again we are going to care for Brazil and the Brazilian people,” Lula said. The seats before him were filled by a who’s who of the Brazilian left, as well as celebrities, intellectuals, union leaders and grassroots activists who had travelled from all across the country – united in their desire to stop Bolsonaro returning to power when nearly 150 million Brazilians choose their next leader in October. “Bolsonaro represents the death of our people, our extermination … Lula’s the opposite – he represents hope,” said Nathália Purificação, 23, an Afro-Brazilian activist from Bom Jesus da Lapa in the north-eastern state of Bahia. Ademario Nogueira, a 58-year-old campaigner from the capital, Brasília, brandished a portrait of his bearded leader. “He’s the horseman of hope,” Nogueira said of Lula, a two-term president from 2003 to 2010 who was barred from the 2018 election after being jailed on controversial corruption charges that were annulled last year. Opinion polls suggest Lula is on course to win his sixth presidential run since he first tried to become the leader of South America’s largest democracy in 1989. One survey, released on the eve of Lula’s announcement, gave him a 13% lead over Bolsonaro in the first round and a 20% lead in a second round runoff. Sixty per cent of voters said they would not vote for Bolsonaro – who is widely blamed for mishandling a Covid outbreak that has killed nearly 665,000 citizens – under any circumstance. More than 60% believe the economy is going in the wrong direction, with rising inflation, high unemployment and a growing cost of living crisis. “It’s Lula’s to lose, clearly,” said Felipe Nunes, the head of the polling group Quaest. Even so, in recent weeks there have been signs of nervousness among Lula allies and progressive Brazilians desperate to see the back of Bolsonaro, after a series of unforced bloopers from the veteran leftist. Last weekend Lula was forced to apologise after suggesting police officers were not human beings. This week he was criticised for claiming the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, were equally to blame for the war there. “If Lula carries on with this verbal incontinence … he’ll give the current occupant of the presidential palace a serious shot at re-election,” the Brazilian author Paulo Coelho warned on Twitter. Some critics complain Lula has failed to offer a clear vision for the future and is relying too heavily on rekindling nostalgia over his two-term presidency, when a global commodity boom helped him pump vast sums into poverty reduction schemes and infrastructure projects. In an interview with Time magazine, published on the eve of Saturday’s event, Lula declared: “Instead of asking what I will do, just look at what I have done”. Those accomplishments – which included helping millions escape poverty and expanding access to education – were given centre stage at Saturday’s event in São Paulo, the city to which a 10-year-old Lula moved in 1955, three years after his family fled rural hardship in the north-eastern state of Pernambuco. The auditorium was plastered with photographs remembering Lula’s years in power. Before his speech, videos were shown in which he appeared alongside global figures such as Barack Obama, George W Bush and Queen Elizabeth. “He’s the best president in the history of Brazil,” said Nogueira, an activist from Lula’s Worker’s party (PT). “Brazil is desperate to be happy again.” Lula, who was freed up to run in the 2022 election after the supreme court annulled his convictions, told supporters that at the coming election Brazil would have the chance to decide which country it wanted to be. “The Brazil of democracy or authoritarianism … The Brazil of knowledge and tolerance or the Brazil of obscurantism and violence, of education and culture or of revolvers and rifles.” “It has never, ever been so easy to choose,” Lula added with a smile. “And never has it been more important to make the right choice.” Also on show was Lula’s attempt to build a broad coalition capable of defeating Bolsonaro, including parties from outside the left. Lula’s running mate, the centre-right former São Paulo governor Geraldo Alckmin, was unable to attend after contracting Covid but in a video message told the audience that unity was essential to protect democracy and defeat “the most disastrous and most cruel government in Brazilian history”. Juliano Medeiros, the president of the leftwing Socialism and Liberty party (PSOL), said it was essential for the opposition to coalesce, as it failed to do before Bolsonaro’s shock 2018 election. The anti-Bolsonaro movement also urgently needed to ensure the 2022 campaign was based on exposing Bolsonaro’s failures and the real economic problems facing Brazil’s 215 million citizens. “In 2018 it was Bolsonarismo and the far right that set the agenda: it was all about anti-communism and corruption and culture wars. This time our challenge is to put unemployment, inflation, hunger and equality at the centre of the debate,” Medeiros said, as delegates streamed into the convention centre. Activists voiced optimism that Bolsonaro’s days in power were numbered. “I don’t have the words to describe my happiness,” said Susy Keith, a 45-year-old producer from Rio who was dressed as a bright red star. “I feel I’m part of history,” said Maria de Lourdes, a retired bank clerk from Marília who clutched a crêpe paper flower to symbolise her yearning for change. However, many progressives feel profound trepidation over the coming months, with Brazil’s pro-gun president billing the election as an epochal struggle between ultraconservative “good” and the “evil” left. “My main worry is violence. I think there’s a real chance we will see fighting in the streets. These are going to be the most polarised elections on Earth,” said Celso Rocha de Barros, a columnist for the Folha de São Paulo newspaper. On Saturday Lula urged supporters to resist provocation during the campaign and to face their opponents with love, not hate. “We are going to win this battle for democracy with smiles, affection, love, peace and harmony,” he said.",News/World news,Lula launches campaign to reclaim Brazilian presidency from Bolsonaro,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/lula-launches-campaign-to-reclaim-brazilian-presidency-from-bolsanaro
5/8/2022,"Ben Stokes has called for England’s “ridiculous” match schedule to be addressed as he prepares for a summer when there will be play on up to 50 of 102 days between the start of the first Test against New Zealand on 2 June and the end of the last match against South Africa on 12 September. Next month the men’s Test team, of which Stokes is the newly appointed captain, will be assembled in England for their games against New Zealand while the white-ball squad is in the Netherlands for a three-match ODI series. “The schedule definitely is something that needs looking at,” Stokes said. “It’s ridiculous the amount of cricket that is expected of people to play. The fact there is a Test match and a one-day series overlapping sums it up. It really needs looking at from a workload point of view, it is just so much. “I want to play as much as I can for England and in an ideal world you would have a schedule that allows you to play everything, but unfortunately that is not possible. My No 1 priority is Test cricket at the moment so I have to prioritise that over white ball.” Stokes has revealed he was worried that people would not consider him ready to take over as captain because of the four months he chose to spend away from the game last summer to prioritise his mental health. He telephoned the England & Wales Cricket Board’s director of men’s cricket, Rob Key, another new appointment, to reassure him as speculation swirled about who would replace Joe Root, who stepped down last month. “After the news about Joe, I phoned Rob and said: ‘I just want to make you aware, if the opportunity is there I’m ready for it,’” Stokes said. “Just to stop any: ‘Will he? Won’t he.’ A few days following Joe’s news, I thought to myself I was ready to take the opportunity if it was there.” 2-6 June First Test v New Zealand, Lords10-14 June Second Test v New Zealand, Trent Bridge17 June First ODI v Netherlands, Amstelveen19 June Second ODI v Netherlands, Amstelveen22 June Third ODI v Netherlands, Amstelveen23-27 June Third Test v New Zealand, Headingley1-5 July Fifth Test v India, Edgbaston*7 July First T20 v India, Ageas Bowl9 July Second T20 v India, Edgbaston10 July Third T20 v India, Trent Bridge12 July First ODI v India, Kia Oval14 July Second ODI v India, Lord's17 July Third ODI v India, Emirates Old Trafford19 July First ODI v South Africa, The Riverside22 July Second ODI v South Africa, Emirates Old Trafford24 July Third ODI v South Africa, Headingley27 July First T20 v South Africa, The Seat Unique Stadium, Bristol28 July Second T20 v South Africa, Sophia Gardens31 July Third T20 v South Africa, Ageas Bowl17-21 Aug First Test v South Africa, Lord's25-29 Aug Second Test v South Africa, Emirates Old Trafford8-12 Sept Third Test v South Africa, Kia Oval The 30-year-old all-rounder had been England’s vice-captain since 2017 and believes that status made him the obvious choice to be Root’s successor. The experience has convinced him that his own vice-captain – and it is possible that the Test summer will start before anyone has been given that role on a permanent basis – should be a younger player who might himself take over in the future. “There are so many people I could look at,” Stokes said. “What I do think needs to be considered is, should it be one of the more senior players or am I going to pick one of the younger players [and give them] extra responsibility? I think I was 24 or 25 and we have so many players at that sort of age. It would almost be stupid not to give them that extra responsibility when we want to give this next generation the opportunity to perform in an England jumper.” Stokes has already decided that he will bat at six, feeling the move down the order from five will enable him to approach his bowling with greater focus and freedom, and that Root will return to No 4 from three to spread experience through the order. “You can see where the places are opening up for people to put their hands up: it’s three and five.” Although England have won only one of their last 17 Tests, Stokes believe the talent pool is sufficiently deep for the side to challenge the world’s most successful sides – which is perhaps just as well given that having recently lost 4-0 to Australia, ranked No 1 by the ICC, they play the sides ranked No 2 (India), No 3 (New Zealand) and No 4 (South Africa) over the next few months. “You look at the players who aren’t available through injury – Wood, Archer, Stone, Curran – they’d all be seriously fighting for places,” Stokes said. “Then you place them among Broady, Jimmy, Robbo, Woakesy … it’s so exciting to think about the team we could put out there if we don’t have any injuries. Unfortunately we do. We just have to pick the best XI we have to choose from and I’ll always make sure we do that.” Already a talisman for the team, Stokes hopes to become a figure who strikes fear into his opponents. “It’s something you want as a leader,” he said, “for opposition to look at you and be: ‘Oof.’” Importantly, however, he will attempt to do this without changing the way he is seen by his own teammates. “I am not going to change my personality or anything like that,” he said. “The people who matter most to me while I’m in the role are my teammates and the backroom staff. What I would hate is for people to be out of my company and be like: ‘Bloody hell, he’s changed a lot since he’s been captain.’ I don’t want that.”",Sport/Sport,Ben Stokes urges rethink on England’s ‘ridiculous’ fixture log jam,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/07/ben-stokes-complains-about-englands-ridiculous-cricket-fixture-list
5/8/2022,"Diane Abbott has said Keir Starmer should “consider his position” if he is fined by police for breaking lockdown rules by having a beer and takeaway with staff during election campaigning last year. Abbott, who served as the shadow home secretary during Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, told LBC: “I don’t think he will – I think this is a lot of hype built up by the Tory press. But if he were to get a fixed penalty notice, he would have to consider his position. “I’m a loyal supporter of Keir Starmer, I’m just making the common sense point that if he gets a fixed penalty notice he should consider his position.” A longtime Corbyn loyalist, Abbott, who is MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, has been largely relegated to the backbenches since Starmer became Labour leader in April 2020. Starmer said on Saturday that he was confident he did not breach any rules. “As I have explained a number of times, I was working in the office, we stopped for something to eat,” he said. “There was no party, no breach of rules, I am confident of that.” However, a leaked memo published by the Mail on Sunday indicated the curry enjoyed by Starmer and colleagues in April 2021 was planned in advance on the schedule for the day’s campaigning, and that no further work was listed after the dinner. The barrister and Covid rules expert Adam Wagner said on Twitter he did not think this changed Labour’s defence. “The fact it was pre-arranged with social distancing guidelines makes it more likely to be reasonably necessary not less,” he said. Allies of Starmer spoke out to defend him on Saturday. The shadow health and social care secretary, Wes Streeting, told the BBC he would not “entertain” the prospect of Starmer resigning over the alleged lockdown rule-breaking. “I have absolute faith and confidence that Keir Starmer did the right thing all the way along,” he said. “He’s maintained that all the way along. He’s someone who practises what he preaches, and as I say the police have looked at this before and found no case to answer. “We’re confident that’ll be the case this time. I think the contrast between Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson will be even sharper because I do think it’s ridiculous, actually, after everything that we’ve seen, Boris Johnson is still there and Conservative MPs haven’t removed Boris Johnson.” When asked whether Starmer would resign if had broken the law, the shadow Welsh secretary, Jo Stevens, told Times Radio: “I think if we get to that situation – which I think is extremely unlikely on the basis that Durham constabulary have already investigated this complaint and found that no rules have been broken – I’m sure Keir will make a statement at that point.” Starmer has insisted that there was “no party” and “no rules were broken” after footage emerged of him drinking a beer with colleagues at a constituency office in Durham in April 2021 while campaigning for the Hartlepool byelection. At the time of the gathering, lockdown rules included a ban on indoor mixing between households. After the conclusion of the local elections on Thursday, Durham constabulary announced it would launch an investigation into whether rules were broken in April 2021 after receiving “significant new information”. This was a U-turn on an earlier decision regarding the case, which had found no offence had been committed. Earlier this year Starmer said Johnson “needs to do the decent thing and resign” after the Metropolitan police began investigating alleged lockdown breaches in Downing Street.",News/Politics,Diane Abbott: Starmer should ‘consider his position’ if fined over ‘Beergate’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/07/diane-abbott-starmer-should-consider-his-position-if-fined-over-beergate
