1/25/2022,"The weekend in Chequers had promised so much. A chance to launch the fightback to save his job with the old team who had helped win him the leadership back in 2019. How he had missed Grant Shapps and his Amazing Spreadsheet. Just imagine having a list of the names of every Conservative MP and their phone numbers! Along with the chief whip’s hilarious nicknames for everyone. Gold dust. A gamechanger. But Operation Save Big Dog 2.0 hadn’t really gone to plan. First off, it had taken several hours for Boris Johnson to realise that the Shappster hadn’t updated his spreadsheet and he had had rather an awkward telephone conversation with someone who turned out to be his brother, Jo. Then, when he had finally got hold of all the right numbers for his MPs, his advisers rang to tell him that the Sunday Times would be running stories about parties in the Number 10 flat and how Nusrat Ghani had been told that being a Muslim had been a factor in her being fired from her ministerial post.  “What shall we do?” asked Big Dog. “We can ignore the parties,” said Grant. “You were at them so you know for certain that they never took place.” “Good point. Great to have you back. I’ve missed your laser-like intelligence.” “The Islamophobia is more of a problem. Especially as you’ve got form for this …” “What do you mean?” “Well,” said Shapps. “You once described Muslim women as looking like letter boxes and bank robbers … “That was just meant as a joke!’ “And what about making one of your old muckers, Zac Goldsmith, who ran an anti-Muslim campaign to become London mayor, a lord?” “That was just looking after a mate, Shappster.” “Possibly. But it doesn’t look good,” interrupted a special adviser. “So here’s what we do. We say very firmly that Islamophobia has no place in the Tory party even though it quite obviously does. We then say there can only be an inquiry if Ghani calls for an inquiry and as she hasn’t yet called for an inquiry then there is no point having an inquiry. That doesn’t look at all feeble or as if we’re trying to duck the issue.” “If it helps,” said Michael Fabricant, “I could tweet that Ghani was mediocre and unimaginative …” “Does everything have to be about you …?” said the Spad. “And that she wasn’t really very Muslim anyway. That should clear the air …” “I’d rather you didn’t …” “Too late.” The weekend had all been downhill from that point onwards. So much so that by first thing Monday morning when Big Dog was back in Downing Street, it had already been decided the Cabinet Office inquiry into Islamophobia that the government had said would not be taking place was now taking place after all. Though, hopefully, it wouldn’t find out very much as most Tories couldn’t even agree on what being Islamophobic actually meant. Johnson’s mood hadn’t been much improved by his morning plod round St James’s park with the dog. Even he had to conclude he was looking like shit. His skin was pallid and the bags under his eyes were now so marked, so deep that the sockets were barely visible. His eyes mere bloodshot pinpricks. Nor had his mood been improved by a conversation with his police detail who had told him they were now co-operating with Sue Gray. Didn’t they understand that the whole point of the Number 10 police was not to investigate anything that happened under their noses? “We’re off now,” said the adviser. “Where to?” asked Big Dog. “A hospital in Milton Keynes.” “Another one? Do I have to? I’ve been to dozens of hospitals recently. People will start to think I haven’t got anything better to do …” “Yup. But that’s an improvement on the fact that for the last two months you’ve been doing nothing but trying to save your job.” A hospital visit meant another pooled TV clip. This time with the BBC’s Jonathan Blake. Johnson batted away the first two questions on Islamophobia and parties inside Number 10. He couldn’t possibly comment, he smirked, as the inquiry had only just been announced and Sue Gray had yet to report. He could quite easily have said something, of course. But why pass up the opportunity to lie? Then came questions on the national insurance rise in April. A hike he claimed was all Rishi Sunak’s idea and that the chancellor said was all Boris’s. And which all the rest of the cabinet were also busy disowning? Jesus, at this rate they could all defect to the opposition as it was Labour policy not to impose the NI hikes. What a shitshow. Even he had to concede the government was run by clowns. Still, eight times he refused to confirm the rise would go ahead. Always useful to have room for manoeuvre to keep his backbenchers happy if that’s what it took to save his job. And as for Ukraine. Putin better watch out big time. Not that we would be sending troops in or anything. But we could refuse to take Russian gas and freeze to death. Back home, things just went from bad to worse. First Michael Gove pledged his support. The kiss of death for anyone. Then some lord he didn’t even know he had appointed resigned as the anti-corruption minister, after the government had written off £4.3bn lost to Covid scams. Couldn’t Agnew just have done the decent thing and buggered off quietly? No one would have noticed. Then came reports of yet another party that Johnson had no recollection of attending. There again it was asking a bit much for the prime minister to remember his own birthday party. And that his wife and the interior designer, who had made the Downing Street flat so exquisitely hideous, had given him a cake. And that 30 other people had been invited. And that he had had another party in the flat that evening. Surely if he’d only been there for 10 minutes he couldn’t really be said to have attended. Like if you didn’t stay the night, it didn’t count as an affair. That had been one of his oldest excuses. Plus it wasn’t as if there had been booze and everyone had got pissed. Besides, it had been a surprise party. So by definition, he couldn’t have known about it. Big Dog sighed and tugged at his toddler haircut. The Phoney War was getting to him. Now that he thought about it, he was almost looking forward to the publication of Gray’s report. Not that she would ever publish anything anytime soon if any more parties he couldn’t remember going to came out of the woodwork. But when it did appear at least then he would know what he was up against. After all, having parties when he’d told everyone else they couldn’t see friends and family and then lying about it wasn’t so bad? Was it?",News/Politics,"It had been a surprise party, so Big Dog couldn’t have known about it",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/24/it-had-been-a-surprise-party-so-big-dog-couldnt-have-known-about-it
1/25/2022,"Four people were killed and one was wounded when multiple shooters opened fire at a house party near Los Angeles over the weekend, authorities said. Police in Inglewood, a historically Black city of about 100,000 near LA, responded to reports of shots fired at a home at about 1.30am on Sunday, the Inglewood mayor, James Butts, told reporters.  Two women and two men were shot and killed and another man was hospitalized in critical condition and expected to survive, CBS2 reported. Butts said the shooting appeared to have been a targeted “ambush” that involved multiple weapons, including a rifle and a handgun. The mayor described the incident as the worst single shooting crime in Inglewood since the 1990s. The two men who were killed have been identified in news reports as Teron Whittiker, 21, Jayden Griffin, 21. The two women who were shot and killed are Breahna Stines, 20, and Marneysha Hamilton, 25, two sisters who were celebrating Stines’s birthday that night. The home was reportedly rented through Airbnb. Sunday’s shooting comes as homicides, mostly with guns, have increased sharply since the onset of the pandemic. Across the US homicides increased by 30% between 2019 and 2020, the largest single-year jump in the 60 years that the FBI has been tracking such data. In California, homicides increased by 30%, with 523 more homicides happening in 2020 than the year prior. Black residents, despite comprising 6% of the California’s population made up 31% of the state’s homicide victims. The increase in shootings has led to fresh fears about a “violent crime wave” following the start of the pandemic. The dynamics behind the increase continue to be investigated. But, researchers, violence prevention practitioners and law enforcement officials said an array of pandemic-related developments were probably playing a role, including economic distress, the breakdown of social pillars in the community, and slowdowns in the courts. The surge affected localities big and small in every corner of the country, but killings have not been equally distributed along racial and socioeconomic lines. While there is no official data yet on 2021 homicides, the increase appears to have held steady, with cities from Oakland to Chicago continuing to see high numbers of killings that affect the cities’ most underserved neighborhoods. Sunday’s deaths come as Black residents and organizers in Inglewood and south Los Angeles cities including Compton and Watts continue to look for answers in the killing of Tioni Theus, a 16-year-old who was found dead on the 110 Freeway in Los Angeles on 8 January. Butts, the Inglewood mayor, said the police were looking for multiple people who may have been involved and urged potential suspects to turn themselves in. “We will find you and prosecute you,” he said.",News/US news,Four people killed in shooting at house party near Los Angeles,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/24/inglewood-shooting-house-party-los-angeles

1/25/2022,"Boris Johnson was facing renewed anger from MPs and bereaved families on Monday after the disclosure that his fiancee threw him a surprise lockdown birthday party, as sources said an official inquiry had uncovered “appalling evidence of mismanagement” at the heart of Downing Street. Sue Gray, the senior civil servant leading the probe into Downing Street parties, is expected to make deeply critical recommendations on overhauling No 10’s operation after hearing of repeated failures of leadership, according to a Whitehall source who spoke to the inquiry.  In the latest alleged breach of rules, No 10 admitted that Carrie Johnson held a party for the prime minister and up to 30 staff on 19 June 2020 despite Covid rules banning indoor social gatherings. Outdoor gatherings were limited to groups of six. ITV reported that the prime minister attended the party in the cabinet room at No 10 at 2pm on his 56th birthday, and that the interior designer Lulu Lytle – who was not a member of No 10 staff – was there. The room was said to have been laid out with Marks & Spencer party food and a birthday cake, with staff singing “Happy Birthday” and staying for 20-30 minutes. No 10 said the PM attended for 10 minutes and denied reports from ITV that he held a party later on 19 June in his Downing Street residence. Gray is understood to have already been told about the allegations, meaning the latest exposé is unlikely to delay publication of her report, expected late this week. A spokesperson for Lytle said she was working on the controversial refurbishment of Johnson’s flat that day, adding: “Lulu was not invited to any birthday celebrations for the prime minister as a guest. Lulu entered the cabinet room briefly as requested, while waiting to speak with the prime minister.” It comes as whips have been warned that Johnson is facing the possibility of losing a vote of no confidence amid growing anger about the multiplying revelations. One senior MP estimated up to a third of the ministerial payroll – ranging from ministers to private principal secretaries and Tory vice-chairs – could vote against the prime minister, leaving Johnson reliant on support from at least half of his backbench MPs. On Monday night angry MPs said they were fuming at the latest “drip-drip” of lockdown breach stories. “And presumably there is more being stored up for release after the Gray report just in case that hadn’t dealt the killer blow,” one said. Another Tory MP who has not yet submitted a no confidence letter said the birthday gathering was “clearly social” and “changes things – a lot”. The Guardian understands that Labour is poised to attempt to force the publication of the full Gray report at its opposition day debate next week, should No 10 attempt to hold back the full details and only publish summary findings. A frontbencher said those who had been running the numbers of would-be rebels for the prime minister over the weekend were becoming increasingly concerned that Johnson could lose a no confidence vote despite multiple charm offensive calls to wavering MPs. “People have been telling them over the weekend that they are behind the PM, but of course, that could be people lying,” the source said. “Ultimately there’s a third of the payroll I could see voting against the PM – if that happens he needs at least half of all backbenchers to back him. That seems pretty unlikely. You can see things get dangerous quickly.” Most MPs are still determined to wait for the outcome of Gray’s inquiry, expected late this week. Johnson is alleged to have also hosted family and friends later that afternoon in his home but No 10 denied this, claiming he hosted a small number of relatives outside only. Regarding the 2pm gathering, a No 10 spokesman said: “A group of staff working in No 10 that day gathered briefly in the cabinet room, after a meeting, to wish the prime minister a happy birthday. He was there for less than 10 minutes.” Addressing the later alleged party in the flat, a spokesman said: “This is totally untrue. In line with the rules at the time, the prime minister hosted a small number of family members outside that evening.” On Monday, Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s former chief adviser, said he had handed written evidence to the Gray inquiry – but warned that some staff were concerned about handing over evidence, fearing retribution from the prime minister. Gray has reassured some staff they would be given a degree of protection, the Guardian understands. However one source who has given evidence to the inquiry said fears of retribution persisted. “Junior staff have been concerned if they are seen to corroborate what’s in the press,” one Whitehall source said. “People have been burnt as well by the Priti Patel investigation, where the advice was suppressed and the conclusion wasn’t followed. It’s one thing to be asked and not lie and quite another to offer the evidence proactively.” Labour demanded in a letter to Johnson that he stand by his assurance in parliament on 8 December to place a copy of the report - then being compiled by cabinet secretary Simon Case - in the Commons library for all MPs to see. Deputy leader Angela Rayner said the government “cannot allow any further cover-up” and urged Johnson to give MPs an embargoed copy of the report to let them read the detail before quizzing him in parliament. Tory MPs said that there would be outrage among backbenchers should there be any attempt to censor the findings. Another said: “The only reason you would hold it back is because you’ve calculated that whatever’s in there is worth taking the flak for trying to hide it.” A third said: “The more that’s withheld, the less likely it is to be accepted.” Labour could also table a “humble address” motion to force the government to publish the report in full, or parts of the evidence to ensure any testimony of criminality has been passed to the police. However, if the government pulls Labour’s next opposition day debate, other options being considered are using a select committee to request documents. Reacting to the birthday party revelations on Monday, Jo Goodman, cofounder of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said: “Like thousands of others, I remember 19 June vividly. It was the day before what would have been my dad’s 73rd birthday, shortly after he had passed away from Covid-19. “It’s completely sickening that the prime minister spent [time] sharing cake with 30 friends indoors … every day and every fresh scandal pours salt on the wounds of the hundreds of thousands who have lost loved ones. If he had any decency he would do what we and the country is calling for him to do and go.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson faces fresh outrage over lockdown birthday party,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/24/boris-johnsons-lockdown-birthday-party-pm-faces-anger-from-mps-and-bereaved
1/25/2022,"The list of alleged Covid rule-breaking parties held in Downing Street and across government continues to grow, with fresh revelations about a birthday party thrown for the prime minister when restrictions were still in force. These are the social gatherings reported so far:  Boris Johnson, his then fiancee Carrie and up to 17 staff were pictured in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown with wine and cheese. The event took place while people were only allowed to meet one other person from outside their household outdoors. A leaked email surfaced showing one of the prime minister’s top officials invited more than 100 Downing Street staff to a “bring your own booze” party just a few days later. Despite Covid rules forbidding indoor social gatherings, ITV reported on Monday that a birthday party was thrown for Johnson, organised by his now wife and attended by up to 30 people – with a cake presented to the prime minister. This is the date that Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, and communications director, Lee Cain, left their roles. Sources have reported loud music and sounds of a party coming from the flat occupied by Johnson and his wife on this date – though Downing Street denies there was any rule-breaking. The Treasury was forced to defend officials holding an “impromptu” drinks party to celebrate Rishi Sunak’s autumn spending review during lockdown. A spokesperson said a “small number” of staff had celebrated around their desks. Johnson is known to have attended an event during England’s pre-Christmas lockdown, which sources said was an impromptu leaving do in No 10 for aide Cleo Watson. The prime minister remarked on how crowded the room was, and then made a short speech paying tribute to her before leaving to continue working. The Mirror alleged that the prime minister gave a speech at a leaving event for his then defence minister, Capt Steve Higham, in the run-up to Christmas. According to the report, the PM was “there for a few minutes to thank him for his service” as a “small number of No10 staff briefly said goodbye”. Former education secretary Gavin Williamson held a Christmas party for up to two dozen staff at the Department for Education cafe. A spokesperson confirmed a report that Williamson gave a short speech and ministers enjoyed “drinks and canapes”, and admitted: “It would have been better not to have gathered in this way at that particular time.” Pictures of a £142 drinks fridge reportedly delivered to No 10 formed part of another Daily Mirror story, which said Downing Street staff continued to hold “wine-time Fridays” throughout the pandemic to “let off steam”. A picture showed that an event hosted by the campaign for the Conservatives’ London mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, was held in Tory campaign headquarters. Buffet food was even laid on, despite indoor socialising being banned by the continuing Covid restrictions. A day later, Johnson hosted a Christmas quiz in Downing Street. The prime minister was pictured on a screen reading out questions flanked by staff who wore tinsel and a Santa hat. While some staff joined virtually, sources said others crowded around desks. The Mirror revealed that staff of the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, threw a Christmas party where almost a dozen staff were “boozing and dancing” in a Whitehall office the day London was put into tier 3 restrictions. A social event is alleged to have taken place in the office of the cabinet secretary, Simon Case. The invite was billed as a “Christmas party”, but government insiders said it was a virtual quiz and Case only passed through the event on the way to his office. Kate Josephs, the former Covid taskforce head, was later forced to apologise for attending a drinks gathering to mark her leaving the civil service on the same day. Dozens of staff gathered for a Christmas party, with cheese and wine passed around, a mock awards ceremony and secret Santa gifts exchanged. The event was joked about in private a few days later by Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s then press secretary, but only came to light when the video was leaked nearly a year later. The Telegraph reported that No 10 held two “boozy” leaving events the night before the Queen mourned Prince Philip while socially distanced and masked. The report claimed staff returned from a local supermarket with a suitcase full of wine and drank until the early hours – with one stepping in to DJ.",News/Politics,A full list of alleged government Covid rule-busting ‘parties’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/24/a-full-list-of-alleged-government-covid-rule-busting-parties
1/25/2022,"“The whole world is watching! The whole world is watching!” chants a group of student protesters – “yippies”, in the eyes of suspicious, coiffed lawyers – in the opening scene of Call Jane, screenwriter Phyllis Nagy’s meticulous, if not revelatory, film on an underground network of abortion providers in Chicago. It’s August 1968, five years before Roe v Wade, and the energy is combustible enough to ruffle even Joy (Elizabeth Banks, a fascinating mix of softness and steel), a suburban housewife pregnant with her second child.  Joy, to use the parlance of a later decade, “has it all” – an attractive, successful husband in lawyer Will (Chris Messina), a picket-fence house, 15-year-old daughter Charlotte (Grace Edwards) – but she is still drawn to the buzz of revolution. In an arresting first scene, the camera follows behind Joy, polished and bejeweled, past the yippie clash with police to her husband’s car, where she muses over their mantra out loud. Call Jane, from a screenplay by Hayley Schore and Roshan Sethi, plants this seed of an awakening for Joy and watches it bloom, in a sensitive, sometimes too on-the-nose manner. Shortly after the yippie run-in, Joy is informed that her pregnancy threatens her life. The hospital rejects her appeal for a “therapeutic termination”; in an example of Call Jane hammering home the point, the all-male hospital board discuss her life in front of Joy as if she’s invisible, immaterial, silent. Will, a status quo guy, feels resigned to their decision. Joy, incensed and unleashed, calls “Jane”, a number for pregnant women who are “anxious”, plastered on flyers around town. Thus Joy is initiated into the Jane Collective, and Call Jane into a restrained, though sharper than it could’ve been, ode to heroism of the past acts of radical generosity and courage which could hold a dark echo for the future, as Roe v Wade rests on the supreme court’s chopping block this year. The real Jane Collective women are explored in another Sundance film this year, the HBO documentary The Janes; one of its participants, Judith Arcana, served as a historical consultant on Call Jane. In Schore and Sethi’s version, the fictional Joy’s transition from patient to reluctant participant to full-blown activist is guided by Virginia (Sigourney Weaver), an iron-willed, true-blue grassroots activist who governs the Janes with a chastened practicality, and Dean (Cory Michael Smith), the preening, somewhat skeevy doctor who provides critical abortion services for $600 a pop. Call Jane’s tracking of these revolutionaries, due their spotlight, is straightforward and clear-eyed, similar in measured tone (and 60s soundtrack) to an episode of prestige period drama TV, such as FX on Hulu’s Mrs America, in which Banks evocatively plays another conservative midwesterner turned feminist activist. That’s not a criticism, per se; it’s refined, sensitive, humanized historicism, with clear arc and stakes, a stylized window into a different time. It’s worth questioning the decision to use a white, conventionally beautiful suburban housewife whose abortion is a stark matter of life and death as an entreé into this world. The film acknowledges this shortcoming with several pointed lines about the dearth of black clients who can’t afford the service, and through the concerns of Gwen (Wunmi Mosaku), who needles Virginia to hold to her principles of equity by finding a way to provide free abortions and prioritize black women. (Virginia’s solution, which involves a striptease negotiation with the fascinating Dean, is a standout scene.) But Banks’s Joy is so layered – unbowed in her decisions, her personhood, yet still scared, tentative – to defuse most doubt in this choice. Each of the supporting characters, too, has intriguing shades of grey in small roles. Joy’s widowed neighbor Lana (Kate Mara, doing a lot with a little), numbed by pills, booze and a copy of Diary of a Mad Housewife, strikes up a charged bond with Will as Joy spends less and less time at home, arousing everyone’s suspicions. Messina imbues Will with a dampened charm that peeks through his frustrating complacency with the norms of his day. Charlotte can seem 18 or 13 depending on the scene, but her peculiar allegiance to the moral stew in which she was raised make sense as a sheltered teenager. Call Jane particularly shines in Nagy’s depiction of the abortion procedure itself – the camera hovers over the metal instruments, on either Dean or Joy’s narration of the procedure, and each woman’s face in anxious repose. The measured observance and repetition of these scenes manages to capture both the clinical precision of a medical procedure and a deeply personal, often frightening experience unique to each woman. That in itself is a feat, one that feels of a piece with recent realist, unsentimental depictions of abortion in the besieged present such as Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Always and Unpregnant. By film’s end, the Janes’ hope is galvanizing, bittersweet. Call Jane never quite rises to the level of a rousing battle cry, but does offer a studious examination of a past that could, terrifyingly, become our future.

1/25/2022,"Another week, another damning party allegation. Boris Johnson reportedly had a birthday party during the first lockdown in 2020, according to ITV News. It is said to have been attended by up to 30 people, including the interior designer Lulu Lytle, on the afternoon of 19 June. While the alleged festivities were taking place, the mood across the country was more muted. Throughout the pandemic, singing near others was cautioned against owing to fears it could aid the spread of the virus. Gatherings were permitted for up to six people outdoors, but they were not permitted indoors. It was not until more than two weeks later, on 4 July, that indoor gatherings between two households were permitted.  And while non-essential shops had reopened on 15 June, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and indoor theatres all remained closed. On the day of the alleged birthday party, Downing Street thanked the public on Twitter for “following the rules and playing their part”, adding: “We must keep going to keep the [Covid alert] level down.” On 19 June 2020 there were 5,030 people in hospital with Covid, and the then education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said in the daily Downing Street press conference that there had been a total of 42,461 deaths since the start of the pandemic, up 173 from the day before. Williamson, who went on to host a Christmas party for up to two dozen staff at a Department for Education cafe, used the press conference to discuss the government’s efforts to get children back to school, confirming that pupils in England would return to classrooms in September. In March 2020, as the pandemic was starting to take hold in the UK, Johnson had posted a letter from a girl who had postponed her seventh birthday party owing to the virus, saying she had set “a great example” by doing so.

ITV said Johnson’s party involved picnic food from M&S and took place in the Cabinet Room at No 10, after the prime minister had returned from an official visit to a school in Hertfordshire. His wife, Carrie Johnson, allegedly organised the party and led staff in a chorus of happy birthday. Downing Street has said the prime minister attended for less than 10 minutes. Johnson had experienced a troubled fortnight marked by U-turns and missteps. On 16 June he had abruptly changed his position on free school meals after a high-profile campaign by the footballer Marcus Rashford. Up to 30 Tory MPs were threatening to vote with Labour on a motion calling for the £15-a-week voucher scheme to be extended over the summer. Then, the day before the birthday, Hancock – who a year later would resign for kissing his closest aide, Gina Coladangelo, in his ministerial office in breach of his own Covid rules – announced he was ditching plans for a standalone NHS test-and-trace app. And while Williamson’s announcement of £1bn to help schoolchildren catch up with lost lessons was welcomed by MPs, it came against the backdrop of mounting frustration that education had not been a higher priority in the crisis.",News/Politics,What were the Covid rules at the time of Boris Johnson’s 2020 birthday?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/24/what-were-the-covid-rules-at-the-time-of-boris-johnsons-2020-birthday
