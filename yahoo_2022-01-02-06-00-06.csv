1/2/2022,"China will be overthrown as the world’s fastest-growing major economy in 2022, according to new forecasts, as the Communist regime’s commitment to zero Covid compounds a property market bust and democracies gain ground with more liberal policies. The United States is now expected by economists to out-grow China in 2022, reversing the pecking order in the G20 for much of the past two decades. The investment bank Nomura predicts China will grow by just 4.3pc in 2022, compared to 4.6pc for the US and 8.5pc for the emerging titan India. The UK is on track for 4.2pc growth, it said. India also outgrew China in 2021 as the pandemic rolled on, but economists believe 2022 could set a new long-term pattern. The outlook is dire by Beijing’s standards of the almost 30 years between 1991 and 2018, in which China never grew by less than 6pc. Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, said: “China has been very successful in containing Covid, but its strategy is also costly.” He pointed to China’s “Golden Week” holiday in October, when revenues from tourism were down 40pc compared with 2019. Mr Lu added: “The zero-Covid strategy has quite a big impact on in-person services. As we extend the zero-Covid strategy, the cost is likely to increase. “For households in those sectors - airlines, restaurants, tourism - at the beginning of their unemployment or underemployment, they had savings to tap. But if they are in such a difficult situation for more than a year and have used up some savings, they have to be very cautious, so they will have to cut their consumption demand.” China recovered rapidly from the pandemic, but has been unable to turn this into sustained momentum. Senior figures in international finance have been warning that China’s commitment to zero Covid is a threat to the global economy, in part because of the resulting disruption to global supply chains, which has fuelled rising inflation in the West. In November the former Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney said Beijing will need to “evolve or pivot” to a liberal management of the disease with vaccinations. However Chinese officials have restated their preference for strict rules, even in the face of the omicron variant. Craig Botham at Pantheon Macroeconomics expects China to grow at 4.7pc, behind India’s 9.2pc but just ahead of the US’s 4.5pc. He said zero Covid policies could make China appear a less reliable supplier of goods. “There has to be a concern on the export side that if you are looking where to source things from, will you go to China where ports and factories might be shut down at a moment’s notice very unpredictably, or will you go to another part of Asia where they have pivoted to living with the virus, and you have got the same access to the rest of the world?” “It is not something that results in everything closing overnight and moving to Vietnam, but it creates a longer-term headwind.” Gilles Moec, group chief economist at AXA Investment Managers, said the rapid spread of omicron means heavy-handed lockdowns to counter any outbreaks “could have a very significant impact on China’s productive capacity. This would be difficult to manage for foreign countries, in particular the EU and the US, which have become even more dependent on it since the start of the pandemic."" Mr Botham said the property bust, embodied by troubled development group Evergrande, is also holding back crucial economic activity. China has endured years of scepticism that its long boom could continue, but analysts at Citi warned “there are good reasons for thinking ‘this time is different’ in China, with the risk of a deeper and longer slowdown there as policymakers in Beijing stick with their intention to wean the Chinese economy off its dependence on real-estate investment, and embark on a more import-substituting, ‘fortress-like’ economic strategy”. The result could be “a China-related negative shock to global activity”, they added.",World/The Telegraph,India overthrows China as Beijing counts the cost of zero Covid,https://news.yahoo.com/india-overthrows-china-beijing-counts-114839062.html

 Former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, an adviser to former President Trump, provided the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot with a trove of documents in response to a subpoena by the panel for efforts involving overturning the election. A letter from Kerik's attorney dated Friday indicates that Kerik wants to cooperate with the committee ""and any investigators who are truly willing to move ahead swiftly and get to the truth."" ""Mr. Kerik is a strong believer in our constitutional system of government and would have never participated in any effort to knowingly promote false claims,"" Timothy Parlatore, Kerik's attorney, wrote to the committee's chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), in a letter shared by Kerik and reported on by Politico. ""He believed then, as he does now, that there were significant election improprieties and inconsistencies as well as evidence of possible fraud in the election that must be properly investigated,"" Parlatore continued. ""It is for this reason, that Mr. Kerik very much wants to cooperate with your committee and any investigators who are truly willing to move ahead swiftly and get to the truth."" Among the documents released via the letter is a ""strategic communications plan"" meant to pressure Republican members of Congress, including swing-state senators, to vote against certifying the 2020 election results. It included issues to highlight such as ""Dead people voted,"" ""Underage people voted"" and ""Fraudulent Ballots."" The cooperation of Kerik, who was hired to investigate election fraud claims by Trump's legal team, is sought by the Jan. 6 select committee because of his involvement in getting space at the Willard Hotel for the Trump team's ""war room"" prior to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Kerik also made remarks to The Washington Post regarding his firm charging $10,000 in travel expenses to the Trump campaign in addition to more than $55,000 for rooms for legal personnel. Kerik, who was subpoenaed by the committee in November, signaled last month that he intended to cooperate with the committee's investigation, but he demanded an apology from lawmakers over an assertion that he had been involved in the Jan. 5 meeting at the Willard. Kerik said through the letter from his lawyer that he would be willing to be interviewed by panel under certain conditions.

1/2/2022,"By Sarah Wu TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen had a New Year message for China on Saturday: military conflict is not the answer, but Beijing responded with a stern warning that if Taiwan crossed any red line it would lead to ""profound catastrophe"". China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has increased military and diplomatic pressure in the past two years to assert its sovereignty claims. ""We must remind the Beijing authorities to not misjudge the situation and to prevent the internal expansion of 'military adventurism',"" Tsai said on Saturday in her New Year's speech, broadcast live on Facebook. Taiwan says it is an independent country and has repeatedly vowed to defend its freedom and democracy. Chinese President Xi Jinping said https://www.reuters.com/world/china/look-future-stay-focused-xi-tells-china-new-years-address-2021-12-31 in his New Year address on Friday that the complete unification of ""the motherland"" was an aspiration shared by people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. On Saturday, after Tsai's speech, Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing, said: ""We are willing to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification."" ""But if 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces continue to provoke and coerce, or even cross any red line, we will have to take decisive measures."" The pursuit of independence will only throw Taiwan into a ""deep chasm"" and bring about ""profound catastrophe"", Zhu added. In recent months, Beijing has sent repeated air missions over the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan has said it will not give in to threats. ""The military is definitely not an option for solving cross-strait disagreements. Military conflicts would impact economic stability,"" Tsai said. To ease tension in the region, both Taipei and Beijing must ""work hard to take care of people's livelihoods and calm the hearts of the people"" in order to find peaceful solutions to problems together, she said. Tsai also said Taiwan would continue to monitor the situation in Hong Kong, adding that interference in the recent legislative election https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hong-kong-patriots-only-election-draws-record-low-turnout-2021-12-19 and the arrests https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/hong-kong-police-arrest-6-current-or-former-staff-online-media-outlet-2021-12-28 this week of senior staff at the pro-democracy media outlet Stand News ""made people worry even more about human rights and freedom of speech in Hong Kong"". ""We will hold fast to our sovereignty, uphold the values ​​of freedom and democracy, defend territorial sovereignty and national security, and maintain peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region,"" Tsai said.
