2/11/2022,"Scotland’s finance secretary has been accused of failing to properly address rising fuel costs after mirroring the £150 council tax rebate offered by the chancellor in England. Kate Forbes told Holyrood on Thursday the Scottish government would give £150 to all households that get a council tax reduction and also homes in bands A to D not covered by that rebate from April.  Alongside £10m to help households rationing fuel use or facing disconnection, she said these measures would help 1.85m households or 73% of Scotland’s homes. Its £290m cost is funded by the Treasury after Rishi Sunak announced a £150 council tax rebate for bands A to D to tackle the fuel costs crisis in England. Forbes, who is due to become the first Scottish cabinet secretary to take maternity leave, said it was an imperfect solution since some homes which were not in fuel poverty would get the rebate. “But it is the only route we have to make sure we reach those for whom it will make a difference, quickly and simply,” she said. But her measures were roundly condemned by prominent anti-poverty charities that often work closely with Scottish ministers. They said it was “deeply disappointing” Forbes had mimicked Sunak’s measures rather than taking radical and targeted action. Peter Kelly, the director of the Poverty Alliance, an umbrella group for voluntary groups, unions and activists, said: “This was a missed opportunity to protect people living in poverty from the waves of hardship that threaten to overwhelm them, and a missed opportunity to right the wrong approach taken by the UK government.” Claire Telfer, for Save the Children, added: “A 54% increase in energy bills is a terrifying prospect for households on low incomes. Millions of parents will be lying awake tonight trying to figure out how to keep their families afloat. The steps announced won’t entirely ease those fears.” Scotland has the highest levels of fuel poverty in the UK: nearly 900,000 homes are forecast to suffer fuel poverty this year due to soaring energy prices, with nearly 600,000 in extreme fuel poverty. The measures are based on a home’s energy inefficiency and if spending on fuel bills leaves people with an income below the poverty line. Campaigners believe around half of homes in the Western Isles will be affected. Scottish Labour’s Paul Sweeney said that given inflation, tax bills and other costs were soaring, the offer was “timid, regressive and unambitious, and won’t do anything nearly enough to address the cost of living crisis”. He said the measures failed to address the funding crisis for councils, which deliver the bulk of these services. Ministers had the money and powers to greatly increase funding, such as a £400 winter fuel payment and top-up the Scottish welfare fund, he said. Frazer Scott, the chief executive of Energy Action Scotland, said the Treasury’s funding was inadequate but he castigated the Scottish government’s failure to better target help at the 600,000 households in extreme fuel poverty. “People will be forced to choose between heating and eating,” he said. “The very real tragedy is the declining health and wellbeing and excess deaths attributable to fuel poverty.” Chris Birt, for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “This was a chance to do something different to the UK government, whose response the Scottish government rightly called ‘wholly inadequate’ just this weekend, and it is hard to understand why that chance wasn’t taken.” Forbes insisted the Scottish government was already spending significant sums on anti-poverty measures, despite its limited powers, including £41m on winter support for food and fuel costs; £10 a week for eligible children under six; £69m on low income families hit by the pandemic,and discretionary housing payments of £80m.",News/Politics,"Scotland’s ‘timid’ £150 council tax rebate disappointing, say charities",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/10/scotlands-timid-150-council-tax-rebate-deeply-disappointing

2/11/2022,"Emmanuel Macron has announced a “renaissance” for the French nuclear industry with a vast programme to build as many as 14 new reactors, arguing that it would help end the country’s reliance on fossil fuels and make France carbon neutral by 2050. “What our country needs ... is the rebirth of France’s nuclear industry,” Macron said in a speech in the eastern industrial town of Belfort, in which he lauded the country’s technological prowess.  The centrist French president, who is expected to announce his campaign for re-election this month, is conscious of a growing debate about energy ahead of this spring’s presidential vote as costs to consumers rise. Environmental issues are also a growing concern among French voters. Atomic energy provides about 70% of French electricity, and low-cost nuclear power has been a mainstay of the French economy since the 1970s, but recent attempts to build new-generation reactors to replace older models have become mired in cost overruns and delays. Presidential candidates on the right have supported more nuclear power plants saying France should have “sovereignty” over its electricity, while detractors on the left have warned of the cost and complexity of building new reactors. Environmentalists have raised safety concerns over radioactive waste that remains deadly for tens of thousands of years. Macron said French nuclear regulators were “unequalled” in their rigour and professionalism and that the decision to build new nuclear power plants was a “choice of progress, a choice of confidence in science and technology”. He also announced a major acceleration in the development of solar and offshore wind power. He said France had no choice but to rely on renewables and nuclearand that the country would also have to consume significantly less energy in the next decades. He said he would seek to extend the lives of all existing French nuclear plants where it was safe to do so. The announcement comes at a difficult time for debt-laden, state-controlled energy provider, EDF, which faces delays and budget overuns on new nuclear plants in France and Britain, and corrosion problems in some of its ageing reactors. Macron announced the construction of at least six new reactors by EDF by 2050, with an option for another eight. His recent focus on nuclear power marks a policy shift from the start of his presidency, when he had promised to reduce its share in France’s energy mix. The French government lobbied hard and successfully to get the European Commission to label nuclear power “green” this month in a landmark review which means it can attract funding as a climate-friendly power source. The Green presidential candidate, Yannick Jadot, said it was a moral imperative to progressively end France’s dependence on nuclear to protect the climate and French people’s safety. He said Macron’s project was backward-looking and would condemn France to a kind of “energy and industrial obsolescence”.",News/World news,"France to build up to 14 new nuclear reactors by 2050, says Macron",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/france-to-build-up-to-14-new-nuclear-reactors-by-2050-says-macron
2/11/2022,"Louisiana’s Republican-controlled state legislature has announced a far-reaching bipartisan inquiry into the in-custody death of Ronald Greene, a Black motorist who was killed following a violent arrest at the hands Louisiana state troopers in 2019. The announcement follows revelations earlier this month that the Louisiana governor, John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, was informed within hours of Greene’s death that Greene, who was unarmed, had died during a “violent, lengthy struggle” but made little public comment on the incident for two years.  The inquiry, said the Louisiana house speaker, Clay Schexnayder, would examine the state’s response to the incident at “all levels”. “These events have raised serious questions regarding who knew what and when,” Schexnayder said in a statement. “The actions taken that night and the cryptic decisions and statements made every step of the way since then have eroded public trust.” Edwards has adamantly denied that he and his office were involved in any cover-up of the incident. The governor was in the midst of a closely fought election campaign at the time of Greene’s death, and withheld detailed public comment until years later after the Associated Press publishing graphic body-camera footage of the incident. The footage showed Greene, his faced bloodied, had been punched, shocked with a Taser, handcuffed and laid prone on the ground by a group of six Louisiana state troopers. At a news conference last week, Edwards declared for the first time that the incident was an act of racism, as a US justice department investigation into Greene’s death remains pending. Edwards has faced substantial criticism from the state’s Black caucus as well as civil rights campaigners for his handling of the incident. On Thursday Edwards issued a statement welcoming the investigation. “I am certain that any fair and impartial investigation will conclude that I made no attempt to impede or interfere with any investigation into Mr Greene’s death. Any allegation to the contrary is simply not true.” The Louisiana Democratic party chair, Katie Bernhardt, also appeared to welcome the investigation but cautioned against “political games” in the process. “The Greene family and countless others deserve justice. I hope this investigation prompts the much-needed changes in law enforcement offices across our state,” Bernhardt said in a statement. “I urge our legislative leadership to make sure political games do not consume this investigation. My most fervent hope is that the Greene family find the justice and peace they so deserve, and Black Louisianians see the reform they need to begin to trust law enforcement in our state.” Schexnayder said a new investigative committee would be made up of four Democrats and four Republicans and would begin public hearings in the coming weeks. It is likely that Edwards himself will be among the witnesses called for testimony. Lawmakers are also expected to request a range of documents, including text messages from Edwards that he has yet to release in response to a public records requested by news outlets, including the Associated Press. In an interview with the Guardian last week, Greene’s mother, Mona Hardin, who has called for the governor’s resignation, expressed outrage at his response to the text message revelations. “It’s a cowardly way for him to approach the murder of a man by his state troopers,” Hardin said. “He said the text message was standard procedure, but there was no follow-up on his end after the murder of a man? They carelessly and lightly really insisted this was ‘standard procedure’. But no one ever made any effort to be honest with me.”  .",News/US news,Louisiana launches inquiry into death of Black motorist Ronald Greene,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/10/ronald-greene-death-louisiana-inquiry
2/11/2022,"Why has Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker of the house, thus far refused to demand a correction from the prime minister for seriously misleading the Commons about unemployment and crime figures, not just once or twice, but repeatedly (Johnson and Patel’s claims about falling crime ‘misleading’, says UK watchdog, 3 February)? Boris Johnson has claimed that both these figures have fallen significantly since the pandemic, but official statistics – gathered by the Office for Statistics Regulation, the Institute for Employment Studies and independent watchdogs such as Full Fact – show that they have actually risen significantly. Johnson has claimed that employment has risen by 500,000 during that period, but a Labour Force Survey shows that it has actually fallen by more than that – by 600,000 in fact.  Johnson also claims that crime has fallen by 14%, when the official figures – which don’t exclude fraud and computer misuse as he does – show that instead of falling by 14%, the figure has risen by that amount. In other words, the prime minister inverts the truth when he speaks about these matters. As the BBC’s More or Less programme reported this week, the PM has been written to by the chair of UK Statistics Authority and by Full Fact – the latter on six separate occasions – pointing out these untruths, and asking him to desist from repeating them and to correct the record in parliament. He hasn’t done either of these things. Indeed, the same lies are still tripping off his tongue. According to Will Moy, chief executive of Full Fact, Johnson’s cavalier way with these statistics has been raised with the Speaker, whose response was merely to say that he expects ministers to live up to their responsibilities. What is that but an evasion, effectively a burying of his head in the sand? When a minister lies to the house, what is it that the ministerial code demands? It certainly isn’t silence, Speaker of the house.Dr Philip HoyChurch Enstone, Oxfordshire  The Speaker has said, in relation to the prime minister’s baseless slur against Keir Starmer, that “words have consequences” (Report, 8 February).

2/11/2022,"The Charity Commission has published its long awaited report into Kids Company, in the latest twist in a six-and-a-half-year saga involving the closure of one of the UK’s best known children’s charities, unfounded sex abuse allegations, media and political outrage, mismanagement allegations and a lengthy court battle.  The charity was set up in London in 1998 by psychotherapist and children’s rights advocate Camila Batmanghelidjh to provide practical, emotional and educational support for severely traumatised children experiencing poverty, violence and neglect. By the time it closed in 2015 it had become one of the UK’s best-known charities, boasting high-profile supporters from JK Rowling and Coldplay to David Cameron. By early 2015, it had expanded its operations to provide services for thousands of children in London, Bristol and Liverpool. Its finances soon came under strain. By July that year, the charity had agreed a rescue plan with ministers in return for a £3m Cabinet Office grant, to be matched by pledges from private donors. The day the £3m grant was paid, Kids Company was told it faced a police probe into allegations of sexual abuse at two of its sites, raised during a BBC Newsnight investigation. The charity’s board believed the allegations made fundraising for the charity impossible, and shut it down on 5 August. Five months later the Metropolitan police dropped the abuse investigation: it had found no evidence of criminality or safeguarding failures. A judge later ruled that were it not for the unfounded abuse allegations, a restructured Kids Company would have survived. Overnight, hundreds of staff lost their jobs and services relied on by thousands of vulnerable youngsters disappeared. Parts of the media, and many politicians, turned ferociously on Batmanghelidjh, accusing her of “mesmerising” powerful men. She became a tabloid hate figure, and Kids Company a byword for charity mismanagement. The charity was accused of misspending charity funds on providing allegedly inappropriate small cash support payments to some children. Some questioned its purchase of trainers, clothes, birthday presents, holidays and housing support for some child clients. In 2016, an MPs’ committee declared the cash payments irresponsible and improper. It accused the Kids Company board of negligence, lax financial controls, pursuing a reckless business model and exaggerating the number of children it served. These criticisms and allegations were echoed in subsequent court proceedings brought against the trustees. Legal proceedings were brought against Kids Company in 2017 by the Official Receiver (at the behest of the government) to ban Batmanghelidjh and the seven trustees from holding senior roles in companies or charities for up to six years. In 2020, two reports amounting to 600 pages, along with 18,000 pages of evidence, were presented to the court to support its claim of trustee failings and mismanagement. The judge, Mrs Justice Falk, comprehensively dismissed the Official Receiver’s case; her forensic 220-page judgment exonerated the board of mismanagement. She praised Batmanghelidjh, and the trustees, who she described as “highly impressive and dedicated individuals”. The case was an expensive disaster for the Official Receiver and the government: it cost the taxpayer £9.5m. The commission made a formal finding of mismanagement, relating to failures to make payments to HMRC, and an instance when staff wages were one day late. It said the charity operated a “high-risk business model”, heavily reliant on Batmanghelidjh’s skills as a fundraiser. It criticised its failure to keep sufficient levels of financial reserves, though accepted this was not unusual in the charity sector. It questioned whether relatively high spending on payments to a small group of high-risk children was appropriate, but accepted the charity had the right to do it. It concluded no regulatory action should be taken against the trustees or Batmanghelidjh and agreed with the high court judgment there was no evidence the trustees were dishonest, acted in bad faith or sought inappropriate personal gain. There is anger in some quarters that the Charity Commission did not acknowledge the scale of the injustice experienced by the trustees and Batmanghelidjh. There were claims that the commission seemed to underplay or ignore some of the judge’s findings, including her praise for the trustees’ conduct, and the suggestion the case should never have been brought by the Official Receiver in the first place. Batmanghelidgh questioned many of the critical findings, calling it a travesty and a rewriting of history. She has threatened legal action to overturn the report.",News/UK news,Charity Commission report into Kids Company – questions and answers,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/10/charity-commission-report-into-kids-company-questions-and-answers
2/11/2022,"David Redshaw certainly does not speak for everybody when he says “no one would want a return to the union militancy of the 1970s” (Letters, 7 February). I, for one, would welcome a return to a time in the UK, not that long ago, when there were no homeless people on the streets, housing was affordable and accessible, social workers were able to do actual social work in the community, beds were available in hospitals (for both physical and mental illnesses), teaching was an enjoyable occupation in well-maintained schools, there were enough nurses, doctors and police officers, and social security meant that there was little or no shame in needing to be supported by benefits.  All this and more was then supported by a unionised workforce, earning decent wages and paying taxes into the system that benefited us all. This was the 1970s, when the unions were strong, and people had rights, as opposed to today’s insecurity, poverty and waiting lists for essential services, as our taxes pour into the pockets of obscenely rich company heads.Sushila DhallOxford  David Redshaw is wrong to assume that no one wants a return to union militancy. Does he imagine that bosses have turned a new leaf and are eager to share their profits? I like to think that I contributed to the militancy of the 70s and the pay rises it won. For working people, the only real power they have is to withdraw their labour (the alternative being to put a cross against a name they did not choose, every five years). Today, thanks to Margaret Thatcher and the failure of Tony Blair, striking requires jumping through endless “legal” hoops. As a result, we have seen a catastrophic decline in the value of wages. I yearn for the days when walking out the door was free of all sanctions. A future Labour government should take the handcuffs off the trade union movement (a fantasy, I admit, under the current leadership). Until that happens, the decline in wages and the increase in poverty will continue.Bill Geddes(Scottish Bakers Union, English Bakers Union, NUPE, UCAAT, CPSA, NALGO, Unison)Worthing, West Sussex",News/UK news,Union militancy was a striking success story | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/10/union-militancy-was-a-striking-success-story
2/11/2022,"Book now It’s widely acknowledged that there’s great therapeutic value in writing - many people write to find out what they think about the world, or, as Chuck Palahuniuk puts it, to use writing as ‘a tool to resolve psychologically what you can’t resolve physically’.Yet, despite these benefits, there are psychological barriers to writing.

2/11/2022,"Chelsea are braced for bids for Kepa Arrizabalaga this summer and are unlikely to stand in the goalkeeper’s way if they receive a suitable offer. The Spain international has had a mixed time since leaving Athletic Bilbao for £71.6m in 2018 and his recent improvement has not been enough to dislodge Édouard Mendy as Thomas Tuchel’s first choice. Tuchel is considering whether to bring Mendy into the side when Chelsea face Palmeiras in the Club World Cup final on Saturday and Arrizabalaga, who impressed in the semi-final victory over Al-Hilal on Wednesday, could look for a fresh challenge at the end of the season.  Arrizabalaga’s form has improved since Tuchel replaced Frank Lampard last year and Chelsea believe he could be a summer target for one of the big Spanish clubs. The 27-year-old has done well when given opportunities this season and Chelsea accept he will not want to continue as their No 2 if he has a chance to play regularly elsewhere. Chelsea have not had to deal with any offers for Arrizabalaga. He struggled under Lampard and his asking price and high wages meant that interest was minimal. However, Chelsea know that having such an expensive goalkeeper on the bench regularly is not ideal and there would be more disappointment for Arrizabalaga if he is left out against Palmeiras. Arrizabalaga, who has made tweaks to his game under Tuchel, impressed while Mendy was representing Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations. He helped Chelsea reach the Carabao Cup final at Tottenham’s expense last month, made two stunning saves in the second half against Al-Hilal and has become an expert at saving penalties. He has played a key role in Chelsea winning three shootouts this season and denied Ryan Hardie from the spot when Tuchel’s side knocked Plymouth out of the FA Cup last weekend. Although the feeling at Chelsea is that Arrizabalaga should be Spain’s No 1 instead of Unai Simón or David de Gea, Tuchel could still drop him against Palmeiras. Mendy has joined the Chelsea squad in Abu Dhabi after winning Afcon and has emerged as one of the best goalkeepers in the world since leaving Rennes in 2020. Chelsea have never won the Club World Cup and Tuchel could decide he does not want to leave anything to chance. If Arrizabalaga is dropped against the Copa Libertadores champions, his next chance to impress could come in the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool on 27 February. Chelsea are yet to end the uncertainty hanging over their defence, with César Azpilicueta, Antonio Rüdiger and Andreas Christensen out of contract this summer. However, they have resumed talks with Rüdiger over a new deal and hope to reach an agreement with the centre-back, who is a target for Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain.",Sport/Football,Chelsea braced for Kepa Arrizabalaga bids and open to summer exit,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/10/chelsea-braced-for-kepa-arrizabalaga-bids-and-open-to-summer-exit

2/11/2022,"A planned American “freedom convoy” of truckers opposed to vaccine mandates, inspired by protests in Canada, could involve a blockade of the Super Bowl in Los Angeles this weekend that “could severely disrupt transportation, federal government, and law enforcement”, according to reports.  The Department of Homeland Security issued a bulletin to US law enforcement agencies warning of a convoy “potentially impacting Super Bowl LVI” on 13 February, and the 1 March State of the Union address in Washington, where the mooted convoy is likely to arrive, CBS reported. The DHS bulletin said such a protest “could severely disrupt transportation, federal government, and law enforcement operations through gridlock and potential counter-protests”. In Canada, trucker protests have been linked to the far right and caused days of disruption in the capital, Ottawa, and at the US-Canada border, with major disruptions to the economy. The idea of a US convoy has spread widely online, as thousands of people have joined pledges to bring the demonstration to Washington. Some people on Facebook and Telegram, the secure messaging platform, have now started to suggest the convoy could “shut down the Super Bowl”. One aspiring politician, Ryan D Kelley, a fringe candidate in the GOP primary for the upcoming Michigan gubernatorial race, appears to have backed the idea: “Sure would be a shame if a convoy of trucks surrounded the Super Bowl so that nobody could attend,” he wrote on Wednesday. A poster being circulated for the proposed convoy advertises the event as a “medical freedom protest” – objecting in particular to requiring children wear face masks. Most of the significant organization appears to be behind the idea of the convoy heading to Washington later in March. Facebook has shut down a number of the groups dedicated to planning the convoy, which has hampered organizing efforts, but also makes it difficult to assess just how likely, or how big, any rally might be. But the Q-non conspiracy movement has seized excitedly on the idea on the far-right message board 8chan, where followers have been closely watching events in Ottawa. One motivating factor for QAnon supporters’ fixation appears to be the baseless rumour that host cities for the Super Bowl also become hotbeds of human trafficking, which the FBI has repeatedly refuted.",News/US news,"US ‘freedom convoy’ could disrupt Sunday’s Super Bowl, officials warn",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/10/us-canada-freedom-convoy-super-bowl

Stokes responded to the recent 4-0 Ashes loss by declining an invitation to play in this year’s Indian Premier League and declaring that Test cricket will be his prime focus, starting with the three-match series against West Indies. As well as documenting this next phase of his career in the film, the all-rounder will be looking back on his highs and lows. The golden summer of 2019 will be re-lived, when Stokes powered England to World Cup glory at Lord’s and pulled off his stunning Headingley heist in the Ashes, as well as his formative years and family life after moving to Cumbria from New Zealand aged 12. It is understood the Bristol street fight in 2017 – an incident that cost Stokes a place on that winter’s Ashes tour and saw him found not guilty of affray the following year – will also be addressed, despite some previous reluctance on the player’s part. The project is still at the production stage and no release date or broadcast partner has been confirmed. But Whisper will continue filming next month, while also producing the television coverage of the Test series in the Caribbean. Teammates have already been interviewed and the England and Wales Cricket Board has given its blessing to the project, which, given that it involves a centrally contracted England player, will ultimately need ECB signoff before being released. Other sportspeople who have recently released official documentary films about their lives include Andy Murray, Neymar and Cristiano Ronaldo. Cricket’s recent forays into this world include The Test – Cricket Australia’s burnished Amazon series that charted the year after the 2018 ball-tampering scandal – and Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians on Netflix.",Sport/Sport,Ben Stokes documentary to continue filming on England’s West Indies tour,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/10/ben-stokes-documentary-to-continue-filming-on-englands-west-indies-tour
