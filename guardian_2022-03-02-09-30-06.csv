3/2/2022,"“I’d like to start a conversation between technology and everyday life,” says Maria Grazia Chiuri backstage a few minutes before the start of the Christian Dior Fall-Winter 2022-23 show. Subtle clues on the direction of this collection are floating around her – such as a cover of Donna Haraway’s Chtulucene piece, a driving force in feminism and post-humanism. “I want to open a feminist outlook on what we envelop our bodies in, and how that has the power to free,” Chiuri says of a collection that she conceived as a discussion between technology, tradition and emancipation, and between past, present and future. This is indeed what is reflected in the decor imagined by the feminist artist Mariella Bettineschi; entitled The Next Era, it consists of a gallery of famed portraits of women from the 16th to the 19th century, almost exclusively painted by men. The eyes are sliced and stacked, a double set suggesting a “double vision”. “Women, in art or through clothing, have been constricted and I want to change that point of view by modifying their eyes,” the artist says, evoking the mutation between objectification and subjectification of women in her exhibited works. Carefully situated between knowhow and renewal, the show begins with a bodysuit complete with organic artery-like seams that sparkle under a black light. The outfit is, like many of the pieces, made in collaboration with the Italian wearable tech startup D-Air Lab, and maintains a constant body temperature thanks to specially developed hi-tech fibres. Then follows the classic Bar jacket, reinvented and enhanced with a system that regulates body moisture and can provide warming if needed, all in a mesh resembling grisaille and able to take an imprint of the wearer’s body. According to Chiuri, this “everyday solution system that takes [wearable tech] out of the extreme sports disciplines” reinterprets the house’s heritage in a subversive way, and questions the functions traditionally associated with women’s wardrobe essentials. The utilitarian dimension fuses with classic knowhow, and elevates and diverts the iconic New Look of the house, revisited in an asymmetrical, pleated way, with plenty of detachable and adjustable corsetry and belting. There, puffer jackets and denim work are given a couture rendering; the leather is laser-cut; the materials range from the most intricate embroidery to waterproof materials, to nylon. Invisible structures and paddings are added as embellishment – yet also conceived to take a shock. As for the Saint Laurent show, theatrically held in front of a glittering Eiffel Tower – something of a tradition for the house – it is a bridge to another history that this collection is building. Indeed, creative director Anthony Vaccarello delves into the art deco style and the spirit of that era, more specifically the wardrobe of radical activist publisher Nancy Cunard, known for her masculine-feminine silhouette. This results in an updated version for 2022, opening with flowing gauzy dresses covered in shell-like outerwear, revisiting masculine classics including pea coats, ample leather trench-coats, maximised Perfecto blousons, all elevated by skinny, strappy glittery sandals.This is followed by sportier lines, such as leggings worn as pants and contrasted with chunky furs; the nightly affair is concluded by tuxedos and slouchy suits, complete with chopped Garçonne haircuts – echoing Yves Saint Laurent’s then shockingly innovative Le Smoking suits. Somewhere between working woman and party girl, Vaccarello reinvents la Parisienne, all with a subtle whiff of a Gucci-era Tom Ford, and reimagined for the local underworld.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Dior and Saint Laurent: an elevated discussion between past and future,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/02/dior-and-saint-laurent-an-elevated-discussion-between-past-and-future
3/2/2022,"A man has been arrested after a teenage girl was seriously injured in a shooting in Liverpool. Police were called to Upper Warwick Street in Toxteth at 5.10pm on Tuesday after reports that shots had been fired and a girl had been injured. The 15-year-old was taken to hospital for treatment in a “serious condition”. Her condition was subsequently described as stable, police added. A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. A man in his 20s arrived at hospital with a gunshot injury to his hand – which was not life-threatening – shortly after the incident, police said. Inquiries are being carried out to establish if the two injuries are linked. Ch Insp Col Rooney said: “The investigation is in the very early stages as we seek to establish what has taken place and who was involved. “While I understand this is a shocking incident for the local community, we have a large police presence in the area carrying out a number of lines of inquiry and I would encourage people to come forward and tell us what they know. “I would ask anyone who was in the area of Upper Warwick Street around 5.10pm this evening who saw or heard anything suspicious or thinks they have captured anything significant on their mobile phone, dashcam or Ring doorbell to contact us as a matter of urgency. “There is no room for guns on the streets of Merseyside and we will do everything we can to find the person or people responsible for this incident and bring them to justice.” Police have made house-to-house inquiries and CCTV is being checked, the force added in a statement.

3/2/2022,"Growing numbers of Britons are paying for private medical treatment in a shift that could undermine the NHS and create a “two-tier” health system, a report has warned. Declining access to and quality of NHS care, both worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic, have begun to “supercharge” the trend, with one in six people prepared to go private instead of waiting. That is among the findings of a report by the left-leaning IPPR thinktank, which warns that in future getting fast, high-quality care on the NHS could become as difficult as the situation that already exists in regards to state-funded dental treatment, which has become a postcode lottery. “People are not opting out of the NHS because they have stopped believing in it as the best and fairest model of healthcare,” said Chris Thomas, the IPPR’s principal research fellow and co-author of the report. “Rather, those who can afford it are being forced to go private by the consequences of austerity and the pandemic on NHS access and quality, and those without the funds are left to ‘put up or shut up’.” The report says that unless the NHS starts performing better “people who can and are willing to do so will supplement their entitlement to NHS care with private healthcare products”. If a significant move away from public healthcare happens there will not be a sudden shift to an American-style health system. “Instead … it might be comparable to dentistry in England, where poor NHS access for some, and superior but expensive access for many, has been gradually implemented and normalised since the 1950s,” the report adds. “We stand at the precipice of a growing ‘opt-out’ by those who can.” Such a trend could threaten the deep and widespread public support for the NHS among voters and leave millions of patients vulnerable because of their ethnicity, postcode, income or job, it says. YouGov polling for the IPPR found that 17% of people would go private if they knew they were going to have to wait longer than 18 weeks – the maximum time the NHS says anyone should have to wait before having planned hospital treatment. Another 59% would wait for NHS care “because I cannot afford private healthcare” but only 10% would do so because they are opposed to private healthcare. In the survey of 3,466 adults, the fieldwork for which was done in November 2021, YouGov found that 31% (1,095) found it hard to access healthcare during the pandemic. Of them, 12% went private and another 26% considered doing the same but ultimately did not do so. “With NHS waiting lists now at record levels, it is not surprising that more patients across the country are looking at private healthcare,” said David Hare, the chief executive of the Independent Healthcare Providers Network, a trade body that represents about 100 private providers across the UK. The proportion of healthcare spending from people paying for private hospital care, fertility treatment, health screening, private GP appointments and other sorts of care has risen from 0.46% in 1980 to 1.77% in 2020 – the biggest rise in the G7 – the IPPR found. The proportion of health spending emanating from those sources plus private medical insurance also rose, from 0.54% in 1980 to 2.33% in 2020. About 13% of Britons have medical insurance. Charlotte Wickens, who had been diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2017, paid £350 for an ultrasound scan of her neck in January after a lymph node appeared. “My GP wasn’t confident on how long it would take in the community [on the NHS] but said it would likely be a while,” said the 28-year-old. “My mum suggested I go private. I was seen very quickly, within a few days of being referred. And I got the positive news that it wasn’t cancer again. “I felt bad about going private,” she added. “I knew it was a privilege that not everyone would have and it felt like jumping a queue of people who were in exactly the same situation as me and needed the clarity just as much, but I could pay for it.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We have set out the biggest NHS recovery plan in history backed by unprecedented investment which – combined with record numbers of doctors and nurses working in the NHS – will reduce waiting times, give patients more control over their care, and harness technology to free up staff. “The plan will help tackle the care backlog by delivering new surgical hubs and at least 100 community diagnostic centres to help millions of patients get the surgery they need and earlier access to tests – providing an extra 9m scans, checks and procedures by 2025.”",News/Society,Private healthcare boom adds to fears of two-tier system in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/02/private-healthcare-boom-two-tier-system-uk
3/2/2022,"The UK advertising watchdog has banned a London underground campaign for Floki Inu, a cryptocurrency named after a dog owned by Tesla chief Elon Musk, for allegedly taking advantage of naive consumers unaware of the potential dangers of investing in digital crypto assets. The poster campaign featured an image of a cartoon dog wearing a Viking helmet and encouraged consumers who may have missed out on making money from other successful cryptocurrencies, such as Dogecoin, to join the investment craze. “Missed Doge? Get Floki” ran the campaign’s strapline, which warned in small print that the value of an investment can “go down as well as up” and noted that cryptocurrencies aren’t regulated in the UK. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) investigated the ad campaign because it trivialised the risk of investment, exploited consumers’ fears they might be “missing out” on the cryptocurrency boom and took advantage of their lack of knowledge of the controversial financial product. Floki, which launched in June last year, told the ad watchdog their logo – based on Musk’s adopted Shiba Inu dog Floki – was key to brand recognition, and was neither socially irresponsible nor contributing to trivialising investment in the “meme coin”. Floki Frunkpuppy pic.twitter.com/xAr8T0Jfdf “We considered that the use of a cartoon imagery gave the impression that purchasing cryptocurrency was a light-hearted and trivial matter,” the ASA ruled. “As such, it distracted consumers from the seriousness of an investment which was volatile and unregulated.” The company also said the ad campaign primarily targeted the “informed consumer” to take note of a new cryptocurrency opportunity. The “average consumer” was protected by the warnings in the ad’s small print, and wouldn’t understand the in-joke and play on words used in the strapline in any case, it said. The ASA ruled that by running on the capital’s tube network they targeted a general audience, many of whom would have an awareness of the cryptocurrency craze. The watchdog said the relative size of the warning small print compared with the advertising slogan meant its overriding impression to any commuter was that it was imperative to buy Floki Inu now to avoid missing out on significant profits. “We considered that the ad took advantage of consumers’ inexperience or credulity,” the ASA said. “We therefore concluded the ad was irresponsible and breached the code. We told Floki Inu to ensure that they did not irresponsibly exploit consumers’ fear of missing out and trivialise investment in cryptocurrency.” In January, the Treasury unveiled plans to crack down on misleading cryptocurrency ads by making them subject to the same regulations as marketing for other financial products such as shares and insurance. The move to change the law will mean ads for cryptoassets become subject to rules governed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to bring them “in line with the same high standard that other financial promotions such as stocks, shares and insurance products are held to”.",News/Technology,Watchdog bans London tube Floki Inu cryptocurrency ad campaign,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/02/watchdog-bans-floki-inu-cryptocurrency-campaign-on-london-tube-elon-musk
3/2/2022,"The public image of palaeontologists as dusty, but rather affable academics, could be due an update. The study of ancient life is a hotbed of unethical and inequitable scientific practices rooted in colonialism, which strip poorer countries of their fossil heritage, and devalue the contributions of local researchers, scientists say. Writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science, an international team of palaeontologists argue that there has been a steady drain of plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, prehistoric spiders, and other fossils from poorer countries into foreign repositories or local private collections – despite laws and regulations introduced to try to conserve their heritage. For instance, in the Araripe Basin in northeast Brazil – a region famous for its huge array of well-preserved prehistoric fossils, including giant winged pterosaurs – 88% of discovered fossils are now housed in foreign museum collections. Juan Carlos Cisneros at the Federal University of Piauí in Brazil and colleagues scrutinised paleontological publications of fossils discovered in Brazil and Mexico over the past three decades. These countries have large, and relatively unexplored sedimentary basins harbouring a wealth of fossilised creatures, plants and fungi. Despite the introduction of strict permits to conduct scientific fieldwork or export fossils from Brazil, and a ban on their permanent export, permit declarations were often missing from studied specimens, and many studies were based on fossils illegally held in foreign collections – particularly in Germany and Japan – the researchers found. The exclusion of local experts was another common issue. For instance, 59% of publications on Araripe fossils were led by foreign researchers, and more than half of them showed no evidence of collaboration with local Brazilian researchers - another legal requirement. Such practices amount to scientific colonialism, where lower income countries are perceived primarily as sources of data or specimens for higher income ones, legal frameworks bypassed, and the contributions of local researchers devalued or omitted, they argued. “It might not be the colonialism we think of, when we imagine 19th-century ships sailing across the Atlantic, but it is still a modern form of neocolonialism where we’re being extractive and exploitative for our own gain at the expense of lower income countries,” said Emma Dunne, a palaeobiologist at the University of Birmingham, and a co-author on the paper. Doing so, hinders local scientific development and depletes resources that could sustain longer-term economic activities, such as tourism, the team added. “I think we are often seen as cute characters that wear Indiana Jones outfits, and could surely do no harm. But actually, Indiana Jones is a really good example: one of his catchphrases was ‘this belongs in a museum’ – but what he means is his museum, not a museum in the country he’s collecting the thing from. “We’d love for individuals to change the way they work, to really focus on creating genuine partnerships that are built on respect for local communities and their interests.” The team also called for more rigorous journal guidelines and education on research ethics, greater enforcement of fossil laws, and sanctions against those involved in unethical practices. Finally, fossils should be repatriated to those communities from which they have been taken, they said.",News/UK news,"Paleontology ‘a hotbed of unethical practices rooted in colonialism’, say scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/02/paleontology-a-hotbed-of-unethical-practices-rooted-in-colonialism-say-scientists
3/2/2022,"When a Russian air raid in north-western Syria killed 34 Turkish troops, Ankara’s revenge quickly followed. But, instead of targeting the forces of Vladimir Putin, whose jets had caused the carnage, Turkey sent armed drones towards the Syrian army, pulverising hundreds of pieces of weaponry and killing scores of troops – all as Russia watched on blithely. In the years since Putin intervened in Syria in 2015 to save the regime of Bashar al-Assad there had been countless examples of Russian attacks on civilian sites – schools, bakeries and hospitals – all of which had met meek responses from global leaders and drawn scant attention from war crimes prosecutors. But the spectre of a Nato member being unwilling to confront the Russian president for the deadliest assault on its forces in decades spoke volumes about the power Putin had brazenly consolidated amid Syria’s ruins – a lethal intervention that emboldened the veteran leader in the years before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. For Putin, Syria became a convergence of a litany of Russian interests, a place where he could test new weapons, take a foothold in the eastern Mediterranean, sponsor proxies, fine-tune disinformation ploys and – more importantly – try his hand at global diplomacy in an arena where the west had lost its way. Before long, he had convinced many that he alone could reassemble a broken country, and that Russia’s intervention, in a conflict that foiled everyone, was legitimate and maybe even necessary. That Putin’s air force and artillery regularly bombed civilian targets, killing thousands and laying waste towns and villages, became so passé that it was regularly overlooked. Impunity became a dominant theme in Idlib province, which remained out of regime control and where Russia assumed it had a free hand to bomb and maim at will. Occasional calls for no-fly zones had no real impetus and the profound suffering of more than three million people became a footnote to a decade of conflict. All the while, Putin propped up Assad, doing what he could to rehabilitate him on a global scene and building a narrative that he alone was the global leader capable of picking up the pieces. While chinks are starting to appear in Assad’s armour of impunity, Russia has never been held to account for the role it played in Syria. To the contrary, Putin has drawn confidence from every one of the past seven years, cementing himself as a regional player and a shrewd global operator, and turned the first major Russian military foray since the collapse of the former Soviet Union into a relative success, all the while scoffing at what he sees as a navel-gazing and splintered west. Syrian civilians, especially in the north-west, have rallied behind Ukraine, sending messages of solidarity and allying their cause to that of a people invaded by a powerful neighbour that seems to know no bounds. In Idlib, residents say a playbook created in Syria of rampant disinformation, indiscriminate bombing, cyberwarfare and devastating heavy weaponry is certain to be used again. But to their surprise, the war of narrative, which had tipped decisively in Russia’s favour in Syria, is being lost in Ukraine, where a previously disengaged world has taken a keen interest. The numbers of global states lining up to sanction Russia has astounded many Syrians who, while they can’t fathom why they were left behind, are cheering on Ukraine from their faraway tents and shantytowns still under Russian siege. In Idlib and elsewhere in Syria, hopes are rising that the tide may be finally turning against Russia. If even Germany is supplying weapons to Ukraine, and Turkey has mustered the courage to prevent Russian warships passing through the Dardanelles to the Black Sea, hope is stirring that the Syrian conflict could be viewed with more empathy. “Their suffering is ours,” said Elham Shaheen, a Syrian living in exile in Turkey. “We know better than anyone else in the world what Ukraine is going through. If they win, we do too. All of my family is watching on. Much of Syria is too.” Other Syrians spoke of the ease with which Russian propaganda is being shredded in Ukraine, and of hope their own agony would be viewed through a fresh prism. “We lived under Russian bombs and lies for six years,” said Marwan Issa, a villager from Homs, now in Idlib. “Our fates are now united.”",News/World news,‘Our fates are united’: Syrians rally behind Ukraine after years of Russian torment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/our-fates-are-united-syrians-rally-behind-ukraine-after-years-of-russian-torment
3/2/2022,"Kenneth Clarke’s description of Theresa May as “a bloody difficult woman” may still be vividly, and excruciatingly, remembered by many of us. It was caught on camera in a TV studio in 2016 just before May made the move from home secretary to prime minister. That unflattering epithet gives Tim Walker’s debut drama its ironic title, though it is not only in reference to May but also to Gina Miller, the businesswoman who took the government to court over its authority to trigger article 50 without parliamentary approval after the Brexit vote. The drama depicts how May (Jessica Turner) hoped to bypass the Commons vote and how Miller (Amara Karan) stepped in. Process matters, Miller says to her husband, Alan (Edmund Kingsley), and that sentiment resounds across other threatened processes since, from the proroguing of parliament to the police investigation of No 10 over “partygate”. As Miller says, “If those who govern us don’t stick to the rules, no one will.” Miller is shown as a reluctant defender, stepping into the breach when no one else is prepared to “put their hand up” and all the more heroic for it, given the media hostility and death threats she received. May, for her part, is navigating her way through a hostile political system and trying to keep the manipulative tentacles of the rightwing press at bay. In Stephen Unwin’s snappy production, both women offer occasional monologues to hammer home the point that they are operating inside a deeply misogynistic system. But while the play’s gender politics are in the right place it feels slight. We wish for more insight, and sharper humour, than it gives us, even though it has the promising look and feel of a James Graham play: a slick photographic backdrop of Whitehall and its surroundings (set design by Nicky Shaw) with News at Ten-style music to match (sound design by John Leonard) along with short, punchy scenes. But there is not the accompanying detail or complexity, and it ends up resembling an episode of Yes, Prime Minister. Miller sounds off to her husband and May does the same with a senior adviser (Graham Seed); her rock of a husband never makes an appearance. There are some pointed “foreign secretary” gags with Boris Johnson drawn as a political Lord Voldemort – he who must never be named in May’s office. This humour carries its own dismal irony but seems a little obvious. The Daily Mail’s former editor, Paul Dacre (Andrew Woodall), is given a central role and controls the narrative around the two women – demonising Miller and manipulating May even while professing to support her. Dacre is portrayed here as a charmless megalomaniac but his bad language (a machine-gun welter of swearwords) is a dully repeated joke. His newsroom assistant, meanwhile, speaks in old-fashioned cockney rhyming slang. If Walker – a journalist himself – intends for humour here, his character comes off as a throwback tabloid cliche. Both Karan and Turner are strong performers but not all the cast was as smooth at a preview show I attended. The highlight comes in the final scene, which brings us to the present day, and a confrontation between the women in which sparks begin to fly. After Clarke’s comment became headline news, May observed: “If standing up for what you believe to be right makes you ‘bloody difficult’, then so be it.” This play proves her point but simultaneously reveals the potholes that leave it so much harder for women, even those as indomitable as May and Miller, to make that stand.

3/2/2022,"Joe Biden will use his first State of the Union address to pledge that Vladimir Putin must pay a price for invading Ukraine. The US president will forcefully condemn Russia’s “premeditated and unprovoked” invasion of its democratic neighbor, and argue that the Russian president underestimated the response of the US and its allies. “Putin’s war was premeditated and unprovoked. He rejected efforts at diplomacy,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released by the White House. “He thought the West and Nato wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us here at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready,” the US president plans to add. The speech on Tuesday evening is traditionally a moment for the president to tout his achievements and build support at home. But the war erupting in Europe has reshaped the prime-time address to reflect a “moment in time”, as White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said. Biden will warn that: “When dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos.” From the halls of the US Congress, now a reminder of the fragility of democracy at home following the insurrection by supporters of Donald Trump on 6 January 2021, Psaki said Biden would seek “to rally the world to stand up for democracy and against Russian aggression”. At the same time he will lay out his administration’s effort to prevent the invasion and hold Putin accountable. “Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson – when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos. They keep moving. And the costs and threats to America and the world keep rising,” Biden will say.“That’s why the Nato alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after world war two. The United States is a member along with 29 other nations,” he will add. “It matters. American diplomacy matters.” Watching him speak in the chamber of the House of Representatives, from the first lady’s viewing box, will be Oksana Markarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to the US, invited by Jill Biden to be her guest. Between rehearsals and run-throughs of his address, traditionally one of the most widely viewed speeches a president makes, Biden spoke by phone to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Even as he addresses the crisis abroad, Biden will also focus on the domestic priorities that remain urgent concerns for most Americans: the economy and the prolonged coronavirus pandemic. In a preview of his remarks, it was disclosed that Biden will outline a plan to counter rising inflation in the US, which has climbed to a four-decade high. “We have a choice. One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer. I have a better plan to fight inflation,” he will say. “Make more cars and semiconductors in America. More infrastructure and innovation in America. More goods moving faster and cheaper in America. More jobs where you can earn a good living in America,” he will say. “And, instead of relying on foreign supply chains – let’s make it in America.” Biden, a Democrat who was Barack Obama’s vice-president for two terms and chose Kamala Harris to be his vice-president, took office in January 2021, after beating Republican Trump at the polls the previous November.",News/US news,State of the Union: Joe Biden to pledge to make Putin pay for Ukraine invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/01/joe-biden-ukraine-state-of-the-union
3/2/2022,"The Maldives do not normally play host to historic football moments. Aside from the occasional regional triumph – historic locally but less so in a broader context, the idyllic and luxurious holiday destination is better known for its turquoise blue waters and overwater lagoons than for anything to do with football. But at the Galolhu Football Stadium, a haven of green in the otherwise densely built capital of Male, history was made over the past week as the Saudi Arabian women’s national team took its first formative steps into the international arena with a series of friendlies against Seychelles and the Maldives, winning both games 2-0. And amongst all the action was a 48-year-old from Albury-Wodonga, doing her bit to help develop a generation of female players who perhaps thought this day would never come. She has the sunburn to show for it. “I was with my colleague at the airport yesterday,” Donna Newberry, the team’s video analyst, says just hours after arriving back in London. “And we were both kind of trying to process exactly what had happened in the last couple of months. “I never thought I’d find myself in this kind of position to do a project like this. It’s almost like a reset in terms of why I work in football, why I believe in women’s sports and why I believe in women’s football as well.” A chance meeting on the sidelines of a Uefa Women’s Champions League clash in Győr in northwest Hungary with respected veteran coach Monika Staab, who was announced as Saudi Arabia’s inaugural head coach five months later, set the wheels in motion. “We got chatting and I said to her that I would be finishing up at Wolfsburg at the end of the season,” Newberry says. “And then she gave me her contact and said ‘look, at some point I might need a video analyst’. “And then I saw about three months later she joined the Saudi women’s national team. I sent her a message to say congratulations and I thought to myself, ‘she’s really brave for going there’. This is the impression of Saudi Arabia [that I had] and I’m thinking, gosh that’s such a [brave move]. “[But] what she demonstrates actually is the pure love for women’s football, to get it to as many countries as possible.” Brave as she thought Staab was in taking on the role, when the opportunity came to join her coaching staff, however, Newberry did not hesitate, much to the bemusement of her friends. “Everyone was like ‘you’re insane, why would you go there of all places?’” Newberry says, admitting her time spent working in the country had challenged and changed her own perceptions. “I just felt like I want to do it because I feel like maybe this is the chance they need. Let’s see what we can do. And yep, it was the completely opposite experience to what I assumed in my head. “I appreciate that we were in a bubble, so I know it’s not the same as people who live there day to day, [but] it’s definitely changed my perceptions a lot. “The girls were [even] saying, ‘we feel ashamed that we’ve only just been allowed to play football’ and I said, look at England, it was banned for 50 years. “[Assistant coach] Sandra [Kalin] and I spent a lot of time together and had a lot of conversations about our thoughts and perceptions about Saudi Arabia, and I remember her saying that she actually felt ashamed of the way she had thought about the country. “I didn’t really feel ashamed about it, about the thoughts I had before, but I just felt more educated.” The establishment of the women’s national team, along with the domestic league, is significant in a country where, until just recently, women were banned from even participating in sport. It wasn’t until 2012 that Saudi Arabia allowed female athletes to compete at the Olympic Games. Those who challenged the system had to so in the shadows. There were no clubs or structures set up to develop female athletes. Albandari Alhwsawi was one of the standouts for Saudi, scoring three goals across the two games, and going into the record books as the first female to score for her country. “You need to be brave to pursue your passion,” reads her Instagram profile, encapsulating the struggle so many of the team have gone through to reach this point. Female players from the Arab world, particularly in ultra conservative countries such as Saudi Arabia, are often marginalised from family and friends for daring to dream. To pursue football in the face of that takes incredible bravery. “I had seen a documentary, like nine or 10 years ago, about the secret Saudi women’s football league,” she says. “I saw it on the TV, and I recorded it and I’ve kept it on a DVD for that long. I always wondered from time to time, what happened to these women that were playing? “That documentary for me was like … I wonder how many other [Arab] women go through this?” The answer is a lot, and it’s not just from the Arab world, with the plight of the Afghan women’s national team in full focus in recent months since the Taliban returned to rule. And for all the progress made in Saudi Arabia in recent years, with women finally granted permission to drive and enter stadiums to watch football matches, along with other, long-overdue freedoms, the reality isn’t always as rosy as the picture painted. While prominent women’s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul, who had long campaigned for the right for women to drive and for the end to male guardianship, was last month released from jail after three years, others remain in incarceration while many more face ongoing persecution, or worse, for their vocal advocacy of women’s and human rights. As the country tries to reinvent its public image, especially in the aftermath of the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, there is an uneasy tension between the traditional conservative structures and the progressive reform they are seeking to implement as part of their Vision 2030 agenda; an agenda that is very much at the heart of this push into women’s football. “I hope that women’s football will move forward in Saudi Arabia in general, and that women will be able to play football abroad, just like the men’s teams,” Seba Rabea Tawfiq, a player for Jeddah Eagles, recently told the FIFA website. “If God wishes, we will make progress as female players and represent our home country like women elsewhere. Then, football will become ordinary for girls as it is for boys.” While Newberry’s path to elite football hasn’t been anywhere near as difficult as those players she recently guided and mentored, it has been unique in its own way. Initially traveling to London in the late 1990s with an eye on a career in graphic design, she worked a variety of roles across 14 years at Harrods, starting in the cashier’s office before moving into more senior positions in the marketing team, during which time she also learned to read and write Arabic. “One of the areas I looked after was the restaurants, so I did all their menus and the signage,” she says. “I was head of a team and the one thing they did was foreign language, and nobody wanted to touch it. “The owner, Mohamed Al-Fayed, wanted Arabic as well in the menus, so that came down to me. He knew that I had a Lebanese mother and he actually met her in the late 90s. She got to meet him and Sofia Loren who was opening the sale. He was like, ‘why does your daughter not know how to read and write Arabic?’” Her big break in football came when she was appointed at Chelsea in 2014. “José [Mourinho] wanted graphical people who understood football to do the illustrations of the scouting reports and do all the presentations,” she says. “So I came in halfway through the 2013-14 season and entered this job which changed my life.” After five-and-a-half years with Chelsea, working across both the men’s and women’s teams, she left to join German giants VfL Wolfsburg, who have won four of the last five Frauen-Bundesliga titles, and most recently had a short spell with Arsenal in the Women’s Super League. Fate, Newberry believes, intervened and led her to her most recent appointment with Saudi Arabia. “When Monika got that job, I thought maybe this is just the opportunity,” she says. “Maybe now I can actually find out more about what I saw on this documentary. “I told her [Staab] about this documentary and said maybe this is the sign. It’s meant to be.” With her short-term contract with Saudi Arabia finished, Newberry hopes to one day return to work with the team as it sets its sights on the lofty goal of qualifying for the Women’s World Cup. But as they continue on that journey, Newberry is preparing for the next chapter in her own career, joining up with NWSL expansion outfit Kansas City Current, a long way from the pitches of Jeddah and Riyadh … and even further away from the turquoise blue lagoons of the Maldives.",Sport/Football,‘You’re insane’: The Australian working with Saudi Arabia’s first women’s national team | Paul Williams,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/02/youre-insane-the-australian-working-with-saudi-arabias-first-womens-national-team
