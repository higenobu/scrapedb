2/11/2022,"Given Cressida Dick’s time as a senior Met police officer has been so frequently marked by controversy and political scrutiny, it is perhaps unsurprising that her early departure as commissioner came as she faced unprecedented amounts of both. Beyond the hugely damaging revelations about misogyny, racism and other prejudice among Met ranks that hastened her exit on Thursday, Dick is also currently responsible for one of the most politically sensitive investigations in UK police history; one that could decide the fate of a prime minister.  It was only a day earlier that the Met announced it had sent legal questionnaires seeking details about alleged lockdown-breaching parties to more than 50 people in Downing Street and Whitehall. Although the statement did not make this explicit, one of them will be Boris Johnson. Hours before the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, announced Dick had lost his confidence and would be departing, the commissioner was telling listeners to BBC Radio London that some of the recipients of the questionnaires “may very well end up with a fixed penalty notice”. While Johnson’s fate is ultimately in the hands of his own MPs, Dick will be excruciatingly aware that deciding that significant numbers inside No 10 broke the law, particularly if one of them is Johnson, could be the catalyst in pushing him out. Dick is to stay in her role for what is described as “a short period” while a new commissioner is appointed. If that period includes a definitive verdict on the investigation, it will be quite the parting shot; if the investigation lingers it will be the hottest of political potatoes to pass to a successor. The paradox of this final task is that Dick will be helping adjudicate on the future of Johnson, a key supporter, who is known not to share Khan’s desire for a new head of the UK’s biggest and most high-profile police force. In September the home secretary, Priti Patel, who has ultimate responsibility for the role, announced she had extended Dick’s five-year term for another 24 months, being unconvinced that any prospective successors were ready. The fact that Patel has now decided to not stand in the way of a change of commissioner – an almost lukewarm statement from the home secretary said Dick had faced “challenging times” – could spark speculation that ministers would prefer a new and perhaps less bullish Met chief to decide on the parties. Whoever takes over faces the huge task of winning back the confidence of both Khan and many Londoners following a series of damaging events. A number of MPs called for Dick to resign in March last year after her officers arrested women taking part in a vigil for Sarah Everard after her murder by one of their colleagues. While Dick has made efforts to change the force’s culture, she has been battered by revelations such as the release earlier this month of messages exchanged between Met officers about hitting and raping women, as well as the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust. The newcomer will face the same pressures, but unlike Dick they will not face the immediate scrutiny of having presided over the shooting dead of an innocent Londoner, as happened to Jean Charles de Menezes, a 27-year-old electrician killed in a botched 2005 anti-terror operation that she led.",News/UK news,Police scandals and political scrutiny hastened exit of Cressida Dick,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/10/police-scandals-and-political-scrutiny-hastened-exit-of-cressida-dick
2/11/2022,"A former employee of Channel 4 News has told the Guardian she was left ​​ feeling “traumatised” and “gagged” after signing a settlement agreement containing a confidentiality clause with the company. The Conservative MP Maria Miller, a former culture secretary and a campaigner against the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), has written to the CEO of ITN, which produces Channel 4 News, saying she had been “approached by a number of whistleblowers”, and expressing her concern about “the apparent use of NDAs to cover up wrongdoing” around gender pay discrimination, harassment and bullying made against the public server broadcaster, the Times reported.  “I’m keen to see the misuse of NDAs tackled in the next employment bill. I was involved in the recent pledge to stop the use of NDAs at universities,” she said. “That is a step in the right direction and if it’s good enough for universities, it’s good enough for everybody else including broadcasters who report on these issues and help shape our culture. We need to stop the use of NDAs to cover up discrimination and wrongdoing.” The former employee, who signed a confidentiality clause as part of a financial settlement and whose case is one of those referenced by Miller, told the Guardian that it had left her struggling with her mental health. “The experience left me feeling gagged and helpless and unable to turn a page in my life. I think that Channel 4 employees believe in free speech and losing the ability to talk about what happened to me has been extremely traumatising.” The use of confidentiality clauses in the settlement of employment cases is common, but campaigners argue their use in companies and organisations has become endemic and say they can be misused to suppress details of wrongdoing including sexual harassment, discrimination and racism. Zelda Perkins, Harvey Weinstein’s former personal assistant and campaigner against the use of non-disclosure agreements, and campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed have called on ITN to release women from what they describe as “gagging orders” in settlement agreements they have signed. ITN said it “maintains a zero-tolerance approach to any form of bullying, harassment or discrimination, investigating any alleged incidents fully and taking appropriate action where necessary”. Perkins, who set up Can’t Buy My Silence with Canadian author and NDA whistleblower Dr Julie Macfarlane after playing a major role in exposing Weinstein’s abuse, said it was time for Channel 4 News to follow the BBC’s lead in not using non-disclosure clauses for anything other than intellectual property. In 2019 former NBC News employees who signed nondisclosure agreements with the network after making complaints about sexual harassment were released from “confidentiality or non-disparagement provision[s] in their separation agreement[s]” said NBCUniversal. ITN’s CEO, Deborah Turness, who is set to leave the company to become the BBC’s CEO of news and current affairs, was president of NBC News International at the time. “Channel 4 News now has the opportunity to stand up and earn its description as an inclusive and progressive workplace,” said Perkins. Pregnant Then Screwed and Can’t Buy My Silence have launched a petition asking Channel 4 News and ITN to release all employees from confidentiality clauses. Perkins added: “This is the chance to be on the side of right, to protect your employees and have a safe and transparent workplace. Why would any company refuse?” Joeli Brearley, CEO and founder of Pregnant Then Screwed said non-disclosure provisions could have a “devastating” impact on those who had signed them, calling them “legal weapons used by the powerful to silence women,” she said. ITN said: “ITN does not use NDAs for employees. There have been only a small number of settlement agreements over the past few years. The inclusion of confidentiality provisions is standard across the industry and agreed by mutual consent, in many cases at the request of the individual and their lawyer. This does not preclude any individual from whistleblowing where this is in the public interest.”",News/Media,Former Channel 4 News employee ‘traumatised’ after signing NDA ,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/10/former-channel-4-news-employee-traumatised-after-signing-nda
2/11/2022,"Apple will warn AirTag users when they are setting up the device that it is illegal to use it to track people, as the tech firm responds to concerns that the product is used by stalkers. AirTags can be attached to personal items such as car keys or backpacks so that people can find them when they are lost, via Apple’s Find My app. However, it has been reported that women have been tracked by the devices after they were placed, unbeknownst to them, in their coat or bag.  On Thursday Apple said AirTag users setting up the device for the first time will see a message stating that using an AirTag to track people without their consent is a crime in many regions around the world and that the device is meant to track the user’s own belongings. Apple added that it was updating guidance on its website on what to do if you are alerted about an unwanted AirTag being located near you, including how to disable it. The company said the guidance would include links to the US-based National Network to End Domestic Violence and the National Center for Victims of Crime. Apple had already built safety features into the product so that a user’s iPhone alerts them if an unrecognised AirTag moves with them over a period of time. Responding to the new measures, Erica Olsen, director of the Safety Net Project at the National Network to End Domestic Violence, said: “We are happy Apple is engaging in the conversation about victim safety and are continuing to improve safeguards.” Apple said it is also working on further updates including a “precision finding” feature that will allow iPhone users to find the precise location of a rogue AirTag. “We design our products to provide a great experience, but also with safety and privacy in mind. Across Apple’s hardware, software, and services teams, we’re committed to listening to feedback and innovating to make improvements that continue to guard against unwanted tracking,” said Apple.",News/Technology,Apple to start warning AirTag users not to use devices to track people,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/10/apple-warning-airtag-users-not-to-track-people
2/11/2022,"“Play the game,” Asha’s mum tells her. After the gifted teenager hands in an essay on the politician BR Ambedkar, criticising the thoughts of Gandhi, her mother wants her to keep her head down and focus on getting into university. Inspired by historical revolutionaries and iconoclasts, Asha (Safiyya Ingar) cannot resist pointing out the hypocrisy of big thinkers. But can she apply their ideas to fight injustice in the playground too? In this compelling coming of age drama, the words of Ambedkar and the suffragette Sylvia Pankhurst form the basis of Asha’s political learning. First shown as part of the Orange Tree’s Inside/Outside livestream over lockdown, Sonali Bhattacharyya’s play moves the ideologies from the past into the present. With Asha battling to prove that there are different sides even to history we see as sacred, there is a lot to fit in. The finale may leave threads of these ideas hanging, but the play manages to still feel topical.  Aided by Alex Fernandes’ bold lighting design, which snaps from harsh-coloured flushes to warm daylight tones, Asha similarly switches from sharing her intimate thoughts on racism and society, to daily bus stop chitchat with her sister. Bettina, the younger of the two, is dewy-eyed and sweet, looking always to Asha for guidance. Played earnestly by Anoushka Chadha, innocence bounces out of her as she hangs around, killing time, to be close to her sister. “I’ve literally got your back!” Bettina squeals while repeatedly stepping up and down from the kerb. The sisters’ relationship gives heart to this fully packed two-hander. As they work together to find a way to protect Bettina from bullies who steal her birthday money on the school bus, their innate difference makes their relationship all the more delightful. When they celebrate their success in an elaborate dance routine, I’d defy anyone to remain unmoved. Directed by Nimmo Ismail and stuffed with moments that radiate warmth – including the appearance of a live hamster on stage – the play conveys the gentle unpredictability of sibling love in its purest form.

2/11/2022,"Joe Biden once revealed his mother so disliked England that she chose to sleep on the floor rather than in a bed in which the Queen of England had previously slept, according to an autobiography written by a comedian. Georgia Pritchett claims the US leader made the revelation when they met in the White House during his period as vice-president. Pritchett met him because she was conducting research for the hit comedy Veep, on which she had been a co-executive producer and joint writer. They were also making a film tie-in of the show.  Pritchett, who is British, records that her initial conversation with Biden was about Ukraine – from which he had just returned – but this was closed down by his minders. She wrote: “He changed the subject to how much his mother hated the English. His parents were Irish and she had written several poems about her hatred of the English. He went off to find them and returned with hundreds of poems describing how God must smite the English and rain blood on our heads.” He also recalled how his mother, Catherine Finnegan – known as Jean – visited the UK and spent a night in a hotel where, she was told, the Queen had once stayed. “She was so appalled that she slept on the floor all night, rather than risk sleeping on a bed that the Queen had slept on,” Pritchett wrote, adding she personally admired anyone who allowed their principles to take precedence over a comfortable bed. Biden’s strong Irish roots and sense of identity have never been a secret. Soon after his nomination as Democratic presidential contender he was accosted by a BBC reporter, Nick Bryant, requesting “a quick word for the BBC” as the Democrat veteran passed through a crowded room. “The BBC?” Biden responded, before adding with a smile: “I’m Irish.” Biden’s mother died in 2010, and has been widely regarded as an important influence in his life, living with her son after her husband died in 2002. Most accounts explain her importance to his moral values, Catholicism and belief in family. At her funeral he said his mother had taught the family to “never be intimidated by power, wealth or station; that we did not have to accept social convention”. Although Pritchett’s autobiography, My Mess is a Bit of a Life, has been in circulation for nearly a year, the Biden family references were recently spotted by the former No 10 press secretary to Tony Blair, Alastair Campbell.",News/US news,Joe Biden’s mother so disliked England she refused to sleep in bed Queen had slept in,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/10/joe-bidens-mother-so-disliked-england-she-refused-to-sleep-in-bed-queen-had-slept-in
2/11/2022,"Unilever’s plan A was to make a huge acquisition; plan B is not to make one, or at least not “for the foreseeable future”. Boardroom U-turns do not come much more screeching. Chief executive Alan Jope referenced a “strong message” from shareholders about their opposition to a £50bn tilt at GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer products division, but could equally have described the corporate equivalent of a riot in the ranks. Boards are expected to know when the investors have zero appetite for a “transformational” deal. Drawing a line under the GSK misadventure won’t be easy, and will require more than a peace offering in the form of a two-year €3bn share buyback. At least the numbers for 2021 were a reminder of the basic solidity that comes with owning an international portfolio of big brands. At 4.5%, Unilever’s rate of underlying sales growth was the fastest for nine years, even if 2021 was a recovery year (especially in China and India) and many peers will be doing better.  Jope should also have a half chance of quietening the grumbles about Unilever’s supposed obsession with seeking purpose in mayonnaise and suchlike. Come on, it’s the wrong complaint. Modern consumers, if not grizzly fund managers, expect brands to have a view on issues like food waste. Unilever’s problem isn’t “purpose” or “sustainability”; it’s the failure to convert those credentials into superior profits in the way that, say, Nestlé does. Still, that entire debate looks trivial compared to what’s coming down the track – a serious bout of input cost inflation. In recent years, €100m-€200m has been the annual norm at Unilever, the sort of sum that can be lost in the wash of regular efficiency programmes. Now it’s staring at €3.5bn for 2022. Cue a warning that the whole lot can’t be recovered from consumers and that operating profit margins will fall to 16%-17%, from 18.4% in 2021. The already-abandoned target of 20% now feels distant. The real test for Jope, then, is his ability to ensure a hiccup on margins doesn’t turn into something worse. The “bulk” will be recovered in 2023, he says, and the rest in 2024. That’s not quite a precise target, but it’s close to being one. And, since Unilever has been around the input inflation track in 2008 and 2011, the company ought to have a reasonably clear view of what’s achievable. One assumes Jope will survive to lead the fight because the GSK mistake belonged to the entire board, especially invisible chairman Nils Andersen. The delivery of operational targets, on the other hand, is obviously the executives’ responsibility. Investors will tolerate some temporary margin erosion in exceptional circumstances, but any diversion from the new virtuous path of day to day predictability would risk another uproar.

2/11/2022,"Emma Hayes has played down the significance of Friday night’s top-of-the-table clash with Arsenal and said she expects the title race to go to the last game no matter the result. “The twists and turns will go the whole way regardless of outcome,” the Chelsea manager said. “It’s not a game Arsenal need to win. A draw or even a loss in either direction isn’t necessarily defining.”  Arsenal have topped the Women’s Super League since an opening-day 3-2 defeat of Chelsea but are only two points clear of Hayes’s team, who have a game in hand. With both sides having dropped points to clubs outside the traditional top three there is plenty of sense behind the urge for caution. Hayes’s opposite number, Jonas Eidevall, was similarly cagey about whether the game should be labelled a title decider. “I don’t have a crystal ball,” he said. “It’s the most important game because it’s the next game. This is about getting out there with an attitude and trying to win the game and not being afraid of losing.” Eidevall ruffled feathers with his exorbitant celebrations on the opening day at the Emirates Stadium. His fiery presence on the touchline also recently resulted in back-to-back yellow cards, against Manchester City and Manchester United, to add to two earlier in the season. A fist-pumping scream on his knees helped fuel the Chelsea players, who crushed Arsenal 3-0 in December’s FA Cup final. The budding rivalry between Hayes and Eidevall has been much more diplomatic this time, with neither seemingly wanting to provide further motivation for their opponents. “He’s done an amazing job,” said Hayes. “They’re top of the league, he’s a passionate, emotional leader, and shares his ideas in a transparent way. He’s brought a lot to the league. For us to be the best league in the world we need the best managers.” Eidevall was quick to congratulate Hayes on her OBE: “Big congratulations. She’s done an amazing job at Chelsea. Especially from a recruitment perspective, she has recruited some of the best talent in the world and she makes them work really hard together.” Eidevall said he was working on softening his in-game approach. “I know it’s an important part of my development,” he said. “I think you need to be on fire to give off heat to the players – I’m a big believer in that – but I also think the coach has a role in making good decisions on that and sometimes I get carried away with refereeing decisions and I need to stop that. I know that. I’m not perfect but I’m working on trying to be.” Eidevall will be without the influential winger/full-back Katie McCabe after she was sent off in last weekend’s 1-1 draw with Manchester United. The South Korean midfielder Ji So-yun is back with Chelsea after suffering an Asian Cup final defeat by China. Chelsea are in the finer vein of form, with Arsenal having lost to Birmingham and drawn two of their other three WSL games since Christmas, but Eidevall’s team have been boosted by their late equalisers against Manchester City and Manchester United. “It’s nice to score at the end,” he said. “But you see the buildup to when we score against Man City, I think that is just pure, brilliant teamwork. We lose the ball from a short pass a minute before we score. “You see that all Arsenal players are sprinting back in that moment. You have no guarantees of winning the ball but you know if you have any chance of staying in that game that’s what you need to do.” Against United, a sublime Vivianne Miedema pass from deep in her own half bounced smoothly into the run of the new signing Stina Blackstenius, who scored to cancel out Alessia Russo’s opener. “It was a piece of art but the important thing was to score,” said Eidevall. “We needed that. You know you’re not going to create many chances when you are down to 10 players . “That pass went all over the world and moments like that connect people.” The combination of Blackstenius and Miedema could feature against Chelsea, but Eidevall would not divulge his plans. “We have the potential to play Viv and Stina together and that can be a strong connection,” he said. “I also think they can play separately, as two No 9s. That gives me good decisions and tools for Friday.” Hayes credits Chelsea’s recent form – a 1-0 victory over Manchester City last weekend, four days after beating Manchester United 3-1 in the League Cup – to working with a smaller group because of injuries and players competing at the Asian Cup. “When you have larger squads in the front end it does break something, or influence something,” she said. “The fact that we’ve had a small squad this side of Christmas has helped us. We train every day like it’s a cup final. The team is in a good moment. We have good momentum because we’ve been finding a level of consistency.” Will the team that handle the pressure come out on top in this encounter? “People dealing with the rising cost of energy, that’s pressure,” Hayes said. “People in times where money is tight, that’s pressure. This isn’t pressure, this is great fun, this is entertainment. Yes it’s competitive but it’s not pressure.”",Sport/Football,Chelsea’s Emma Hayes plays down derby with league leaders Arsenal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/10/chelseas-emma-hayes-plays-down-derby-with-league-leaders-arsenal
2/11/2022,"Durham University’s largest donor has pulled his financial support for the institution because of its Covid-19 restrictions. Hedge fund manager Mark Hillery had donated £7m over the past seven years but publicly criticised what he called the “ridiculous and ineffective” coronavirus rules in place at the university.  He said he would not “visit Durham again while there is a single Covid-related rule imposed on the students”. It comes as Boris Johnson suggested all remaining restrictions in England could end later this month. Hillery told the PA news agency that “the principal trigger [for withdrawing support] has been the insistence to persist with restrictions and impositions on healthy 20-year-olds that are way beyond those placed on the rest of society since the start of the 2021-22 academic year. “These go against government guidelines. To resort yet again to online teaching at the start of this term was a disgrace.” The university resumed online learning after the rise in Omicron cases in the north-east. Hillery said: “Durham, and many other higher education establishments, are leaving students as the final members of society to still be subjected to these ineffective and ridiculous rules. That seems both surreal and unjust. This is not how we should be prioritising within our society. The younger generations have been subjected to enough of this.” He also resigned from the external advisory board of his old college, Collingwood, and ended dialogue with Durham. Collingwood received £4m in donations from Hillery in 2016, which funded the 200-seater Mark Hillery Arts Centre, a yoga studio, bar conservatory and expanded JCR common room and gym. He has hosted talks on finance and is known for putting generous amounts behind the Collingwood bar. Hillery told the Palatinate student newspaper: “It’s a very depressing state of affairs. I had always felt a very close connection and obligation to the university and its students. It feels odd to be so disengaged, but it is what it is now.” A spokesperson for Durham said: “Mark Hillery is a generous benefactor to the university. We appreciate his support for many initiatives, including the Mark Hillery Arts Centre, a studio theatre and music venue at our Collingwood College. These contributions have improved our students’ experience and will continue to make an impact for many years to come. “Our approach to managing the Covid-19 pandemic has always prioritised the health, safety and wellbeing of our staff, students and wider community.” PA Media contributed to this report",News/Education,Durham University’s largest donor pulls funding over Covid restrictions,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/10/durham-university-mark-hillery-donor-pulls-funding-covid-restrictions
2/11/2022,"A 5,000-year-old chalk sculpture discovered in east Yorkshire, due to be displayed at the British Museum, has been described as the most important piece of prehistoric art to be found in Britain in the last century. The object, a Burton Agnes drum, is a chalk sculpture which had been decorated with motifs similar to the artistic style at the same time as Stonehenge was built. The drum was discovered alongside the burial of three children.  The drum is hailed to be such an important discovery due to its similarity to a group of objects already in the British Museum’s collection. The Folkton drums, three barrel-shaped cylinders made of chalk, were found in North Yorkshire buried alongside the remains of a child, and have been part of the British Museum’s collection since 1889. They are, according to the British Museum, some of the “most famous and enigmatic ancient objects ever unearthed in Britain”. Relatively little is known about the Folkton drums and their context but this new drum, which was found about 15 miles away, sheds new light on them. The exact age of the Folkton drums was never known, with a consensus guess that they were made around 2500 – 2000BC. However, due to new technology and the finding of the new drum, the Folkton drums can be identified as being nearly 500 years older than previously thought. This new discovery, only the fourth example of its kind known to have survived, is nearly identical to the Folkton drums and can also be described as a chalk drum. Despite the use of the term ‘drum’, they are not thought to have had a musical function. Instead, they are works of sculptural art, and have been interpreted to be intended as talismans to protect the deceased children they accompanied. The Burton Agnes drum is due to be displayed to the public for the first time on Thursday, alongside all three Folkton drums, as part of the World of Stonehenge exhibition at the British Museum. Neil Wilkin, curator of The World of Stonehenge at the British Museum, said the discovery was “truly remarkable”. “The Folkton drums have long remained a mystery to experts for well over a century, but this new example finally begins to give us some answers. To my mind, the Burton Agnes drum is even more intricately carved and reflects connections between communities in Yorkshire, Stonehenge, Orkney and Ireland,” he said. “The discovery of the Burton Agnes grave is highly moving. The emotions the new drum expresses are powerful and timeless, they transcend the time of Stonehenge and reflect a moment of tragedy and despair that remains undimmed after 5,000 years,” he added. “We are honoured that the British Museum will be the first place the public will be able to see this important object, and that they will see it alongside 430 other ancient items telling the spectacular story of Stonehenge and the vibrant world in which it was built.” Mark Allen, the director of Allen Archaeology, said that it has been a “real privilege” to have been involved in its discovery, and took the opportunity to thank the “landowners for their enthusiasm and interest in the project from the outset.” “When we heard about the find from the team on site and saw the photos of the drum that were messaged over to us, it was clear we were looking at something extraordinary,” he said. “Although the photos did not do it justice, and we were all stunned to see it up close when it came off site.” Alice Beasley, who first uncovered the drum as an archeologist for Allen Archeology, said discovering it was a “thrilling and humbling” experience. “Seeing the love and effort put into burying the individuals over 5,000 years ago was truly moving,” she said. The World of Stonehenge exhibition at the British Museum, on display until mid-July, is the UK’s first major exhibition on Stonehenge.

2/11/2022,"A British pensioner accused of murdering his terminally-ill wife in Cyprus will appeal to the island’s top legal officer to reduce the charge to assisted suicide after confessing to the alleged mercy killing. Nearly two months after Janice Hunter’s body was found in the couple’s Paphos home, her lifelong partner, David, pleaded not guilty before an assize court sitting in the resort town on Thursday.  “We will be asking the attorney general to change the charge to assisted suicide which fits perfectly to the facts of this case,” said Michael Polak, a barrister with the British legal aid group Justice Abroad who had flown in from London as part of the defence team. “At a time when the parliament of Cyprus is discussing the legislation of euthanasia … we will be submitting that assisting suicide would be a much more appropriate charge than murder which carries a mandatory life sentence.” A retired miner, Hunter told police he had blocked his wife’s air passages until she died in his hands as part of a suicide pact aimed at relieving her of the immense pain caused by blood cancer. He then tried to end his own life, consuming prescription pills and alcohol, before authorities, alerted by relatives in the UK, rushed to the scene. By the time police arrived, the 74-year-old was found slumped on a sofa next to Janice, 75, in the sitting room of their two-story maisonette. Hunter cut a forlorn figure as he was brought into the courtroom in handcuffs wearing the black clothes he has donned since being transferred to Nicosia general prison in the island’s capital. Speaking via an interpreter, he said “not guilty” when a prosecutor presented the charge of premeditated murder. The three-member bench ordered that he continue to be detained in jail until the court reconvenes to hear the case on 18 April. But the Briton has the full support of the couple’s daughter, Lesley, who in a heart-rending statement on the eve of his court appearance said her “bewildered and terrified” father had relieved her mother of great suffering. “My parents were together for 56 years and doted on each other. They were teenage sweethearts who couldn’t bear to be apart,” she wrote on the campaigning platform Crowd Justice. “When they retired, they moved to Cyprus, a place they both loved. Over the last five years my mum became increasingly unwell. She was suffering from blood cancer and was in a great deal of pain and her quality of life had drastically diminished. This was a terminal disease that had taken the life of her sister, and the pain she was under was getting worse and worse. She wanted to die and wanted for her suffering to be ended.” Expressing relief that her father had survived, she appealed for him to be released and sent back to the UK where there were people who could support him. “My dad devoted himself to caring for my mum. We love him very much and want to help him in any way possible,” she said. “My father is in the latter stages of his life, and we just want him to be with us.” In a Mediterranean nation where euthanasia remains taboo – and has run up against stiff resistance from the powerful Orthodox Church – the 18 December killing has touched a nerve. But Hunter’s predicament has also elicited compassion. “Everybody, it seems, here in Cyprus, from prison guards to members of the general public, have been overwhelmingly supportive of him,” Polak told the Guardian. “I don’t believe that people in Cyprus think prosecution for murder is an appropriate action in this case.”",News/World news,British man denies murder of terminally-ill wife in Cyprus,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/british-man-denies-of-terminally-ill-wife-in-cyprus
