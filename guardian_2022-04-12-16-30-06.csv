4/12/2022,"The corporate regulator has launched legal action against two companies it has accused of charging excessive interest rates on loans taken out by vulnerable people to buy household essentials, including washing machines and mobile phones. In lawsuits filed in the federal court on Tuesday, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission accused the two companies, Rent4Keeps and Layaway Depot, of disguising loans as rental contracts in order to avoid the 48% a year cap on interest contained in credit law. The deputy chair of Asic, Sarah Court, said that 48% “sounds like a hell of a lot to be paying on anything” but was allowed under the Credit Act. “What what these parties are effectively charging their customers is … 267%, 400% and 600%,” she said. “Obviously, that makes money for those companies but that is to the significant detriment of those disadvantaged consumers.” She said the companies were also “not upfront about what these charges are going to be”. For example, a fridge with a retail price of $365 could cost almost $2,500 over the course of a contract lasting a few years, she said. “People have no idea of the amounts that they’re going to end up paying through the course of these arrangements and that’s another one of our concerns,” she said. She said the rent-to-buy model was targeted at people on low incomes, including those on Centrelink benefits, and people in Indigenous communities. “There is a significant proportion of the community that cannot get access to other credit and … their only recourse to be able to buy what are, in essence, essential goods … washing machines and fridges and the like,” she said. The two lawsuits are Asic’s latest move in a campaign aimed at companies allegedly trying to evade the lending cap. It is currently awaiting the result of an appeal in a case it lost against Cigno, a group controlled by the former rugby union player Mark Swanepoel and owned by members of the Swanepoel family. Court said that if Asic cannot prevail in court over the issue “it would really be a matter for the parliament to decide whether it wants to bring in any changes that really squarely deal with these issues”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Mark Holden, a solicitor with Indigenous legal service program Mob Strong, said “First Nations communities are often targeted by consumer lease companies who go door-to-door or set up shop in remote communities, sign vulnerable people up through their Centrelink payments and then collect payments that are often many times the market price of the goods. “Sometimes the goods don’t even work. “We are really glad to see Asic taking this action today and hope they continue to prioritise protecting the consumer rights of First Nations peoples.” On its website, Rent4Keeps, which is run by Kevin Payne and his wife, Vikki Payne, claims it is “making a positive difference to people’s lives” and says customers can “rent-to-own” household goods including beds, washing machines and games consoles. In its statement of claim, Asic accuses Rent4Keeps franchisee, Darranda – which is also controlled by the Paynes – of charging $1.9m to customers between 1 April 2019 and 30 June 2019. Asic told the court this was over three times more ($1.28m) than it would have been entitled to under the rate cap enshrined in credit law, resulting in customers being overcharged an average of $2,400. Layaway Depot, which on its website bills itself as “the easy way to own”, offers electronics including smartphones, computers and home audio speakers. One customer paid $780 for “Neighbour Hater” speakers with a market value of just $200, paying an effective annual interest rate of almost 760%. Company documents show that Layaway Depot’s directors are New Zealander John Hotchin and Kiwi-born Queensland resident Peter McConnochie.

4/12/2022,"In 2016 Bayern Munich faced a very difficult task. The club had to find a successor for Pep Guardiola. Only one came into consideration: Carlo Ancelotti. For us players this meant a change on the one hand. What Ancelotti said in one week, Guardiola said in three hours. On the other hand, as was the case for his predecessor, it was also true for Ancelotti: as a player you feel comfortable because you sense that the coach is ready to make his methods available to the team. That is why he is successful everywhere. In a poll on who is the best coach in the world very few would say Carlo Ancelotti, even in Italy. Yet he has a unique record. He is the only one who will soon be title winner in Europe’s five big leagues: with Milan in Serie A, Chelsea in the Premier League, Paris Saint‑Germain in Ligue 1 and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga, while with Real Madrid he is on the verge of winning La Liga. There is also no coach who has won the Champions League more often, three times, or with more clubs, two. Ancelotti is also one of seven men to have held this trophy aloft as a player and as a coach. As a player he prevailed because he possessed extraordinary strategic skills. Ancelotti was part of the legendary Milan team under Arrigo Sacchi, who taught concept football to great individual players. So Ancelotti was on the pitch when a revolution was taking place, when the operating system of the modern game against the ball was being programmed: the ball-oriented zonal marking, the blueprint of which is still current. This experience is the prerequisite for a top coach. Any coach who has not played at the highest level is missing something that Ancelotti has experienced. And so his deep understanding of the game, the players, the milieu of professional football comes from within. A dogmatic coach he is not. All his teams have a tactical level, he thinks from the defensive. But as a player, you get your freedom. Ancelotti is best at managing extreme characters. Ancelotti has also got on with powerful men like Silvio Berlusconi, Roman Abramovich, Florentino Pérez or Nasser al-Khelaifi. After a few weeks in Munich he approached me and asked who had more to say, Uli Hoeness or Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. It was important for him to know who was giving the thumbs up or thumbs down within the club. At the time when he was coaching us it sometimes looked chaotic in the dressing room. Basically, kids’ stuff. Ancelotti was supposed to provide discipline. He was given a list of five points that we players should pay attention to in future. After training, he took me aside, showed me the list and said: “Now they’re grabbing me by the balls.” Then Ancelotti stood in the dressing room in front of the team, looked at a piece of paper and said: “I have an order from the board to read you a list.” What he said, his tone, the way he looked, expressed:‘This is not part of my job, I’m not coaching a youth team after all. But if the bosses want me to do it, I’ll do it.’ Some players countered that signing thousands of autograph cards a month was too much for them. Ancelotti said: “It would be the same for me.” Ancelotti is independent. He has charm, humour and a certain nonchalance. He manages to keep his distance. He would often sit in a restaurant with his family for an hour and a half after the final whistle and eat tortellini. Growing up as the son of farmers in Reggiolo in northern Italy, Ancelotti was used to helping out on the farm as a youngster. He embodies what is possible in football. You can come from the bottom to the top and shine on a big stage. Yet he never takes himself too seriously. Those who now ask how one can be successful in five countries with five languages need to know: Footballers do a lot of things non-verbally. And Ancelotti has mastered the 50 important words needed in this game in every language. Top‑class football is international. Real, PSG, Chelsea, Bayern and Milan differ in style only in nuances. Ancelotti is the ideal solution for quietly taking over such teams. In Madrid, he surely loves the exuberant universal talent of Karim Benzema, the game intelligence of Luka Modric, the precision of Toni Kroos’s passes. Benzema’s missteps, on the other hand, interest him less, and he no longer wants to teach Kroos how to defend. As Real’s coach, he is aware that a debacle can happen, like the 4-0 defeat against Barcelona. Genius is simply not available in every game. Ancelotti knows that and the players know that he knows it. They support each other because he is one of them. He does not lose his nerve after defeats but stands in front of his players. Team and coach are one unit, that is a merit of Ancelotti. The 3-1 victories against PSG and at Chelsea proved that Real Madrid can win not only the championship but also the Champions League. I played my last year under Ancelotti. When I told him I was ending my career, he asked me to reconsider. He said I could play at this level until I was 40. When he realised that I had made up my mind, he tried to get me on as his assistant coach. But I wanted to get some distance. He loves what he does and loves football and footballers. That is why everyone likes to play for the great coach Carlo Ancelotti. Philipp Lahm’s column appears regularly in the Guardian.

4/12/2022,"While Scott Morrison is busy comparing himself to a dentist and Anthony Albanese is musing about growing on the job, let’s talk about something more pertinent – Alan Tudge and a $500,000-plus taxpayer-funded payout no one wants to discuss. This story has a few moving parts. Last year, the prime minister faced pressure to do something about Tudge. His former staffer Rachelle Miller alleged in December that Tudge had been emotionally and, in one instance, physically abusive towards her during a personal and professional relationship. Tudge denied Miller’s allegations and went to the backbench. Morrison then appointed former bureaucrat Vivienne Thom to investigate whether or not there had been any breach of ministerial standards. After an inquiry, Thom said there wasn’t “a basis for a finding that Mr Tudge’s conduct breached the ministerial standards”. There were two footnotes. “The evidence available to the inquiry was limited by Ms Miller’s decision not to participate”, Thom wrote, and the ministerial standards “do not specifically address broader integrity and conflict of interest issues that can be a consequence of relationships that do not amount to ongoing or family relationships”. After the Thom report was released, Tudge said he had “requested not to be returned to the frontbench before the election”, saying he would focus on his family and electorate. But in the final week of parliament, government officials revealed that Tudge actually remained education minister and was “on leave” despite the acting minister, Stuart Robert, performing the functions of the job. Roll forward to Sunday. Morrison was asked by a journalist whether or not Tudge would return to the cabinet after the election. The prime minister responded: “Alan Tudge is still in my cabinet.” This insight was something of a mic drop, given Morrison had said very clearly back on 4 March Tudge was “not seeking to return to the frontbench and I support his decision”. By Monday of this week, Morrison was telling Sky News that Tudge “didn’t resign, and nor was he dismissed. He stood aside, and we had an independent inquiry. That independent inquiry found there was no reason he could not continue on as a minister”. Morrison finally noted: “Alan decided to stay, standing aside”. Ladies and gentlemen, we have Schrödinger’s minister. Tudge is both out of the cabinet and in the cabinet. He’s in for the purposes of maintaining an ongoing claim to the position, but most decidedly out when it comes to the routine scrutiny that is supposed to accompany such exalted status. Then we arrive at the payout. Back in November 2020, Miller filed a workplace harassment lawsuit seeking compensation for her treatment as a staffer, including allegedly being belittled in Tudge’s office and deprived of further career progression once shuffled into the office of then employment minister Michaelia Cash. On Monday, news.com.au revealed Miller was in line to receive a taxpayer-funded compensation payment of at least $500,000, plus legal costs. That’s half a million-plus – on the taxpayer. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Just as Tudge seems to be afflicted by absent presenteeism, this payout is both present and absent. Clearly, some kind of settlement between Miller and the commonwealth (pertaining to something) has been reached or almost reached. But details remain elusive. Nobody is prepared to answer any questions about it. The Coalition’s campaign spokesperson, Anne Ruston, said earlier this week the payout was not related to the (denied) misconduct allegations raised by Miller but “a separate matter”. Apart from that, Ruston was Sergeant Schultz. (If you aren’t as old as me, Google Hogan’s Heroes. You’ll get the drift.) On Adelaide radio on Tuesday, Morrison was asked how he could argue that the payout to Miller was private when it was taxpayers picking up the tab. “Well, I have no visibility on that at all,” the prime minister said. Umm, sorry, what? Aren’t you the prime minister? Morrison continued: “I can’t confirm to you whether a payment has even been made. I know it’s taxpayers’ money and those matters are handled by the Department of Finance at arm’s length from politicians including, you know, the special minister of state.” The radio host in Adelaide was similarly flummoxed. “So does money just fly out of the sky in the finance department? Half a million dollars lands in your lap and no one’s got any real oversight over it?” Words from the prime minister followed. “You’re assuming that there aren’t matters that relate to members right across the parliament as we go into an election and there are staffers who are ending … concluding up their time”. “The Department of Finance has provisions that enable them to deal with these matters privately. But you’re also assuming that there is any wrongdoing on Alan Tudge’s part. No matter has been raised with me by the Department of Finance in relation to any of those things”. To be clear: nobody is assuming anything. What’s happening is journalists are asking questions – perfectly reasonable, routine ones – that are not being answered. Morrison claims he’s being upfront. The prime minister said on Tuesday the government had released the Thom report “and it’s there for people to see that Alan Tudge can continue to serve”. Tudge had chosen “for a period of time” to stand aside from the ministry. No other education minister had been sworn in. “We’re very transparent about all of that,” he said. Really? Here in full is what Morrison said on 4 March. The italics are mine, for emphasis. “In December, minister Tudge agreed to my request to stand aside from the ministry, while these allegations were examined. “Today he has informed me that in the interests of his family and his own wellbeing and in order to focus on his re-election as the Member for Aston he is not seeking to return to the frontbench, and I support his decision. “Minister Stuart Robert will continue in his role as acting minister for education and youth and minister for employment, workforce, skills, small and family business.” We can end with these observations. Schrödinger’s minister and the visibly invisible payout is an extraordinary set of circumstances. Let’s be very clear and direct about what’s happening. Morrison and the government is being the opposite of transparent. Morrison is hoping to slide away from scrutiny by revving his campaign engine so loudly that all voters will hear is “Don’t vote Labor”.",News/Australia news,We have Schrödinger’s minister with Alan Tudge both in and out of Morrison’s cabinet,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/we-have-schrodingers-minister-with-alan-tudge-both-in-and-out-of-morrisons-cabinet
4/12/2022,"Deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce has wrongly claimed that an infrastructure package that includes funding for a second port in Darwin has already been legislated, despite the budget bills lapsing when parliament was dissolved on Monday. Speaking in the Northern Territory on Tuesday, where the Coalition is targeting two Labor-held seats, Joyce was talking up the government’s regional funding commitments, including $2.6bn allocated to the NT through a regional development plan announced on budget night. This will include $1.5bn to develop the Middle Arm wharf to allow the export of gas, including hydrogen, and critical minerals. The government has also indicated the wharf could in future be used by Defence as an alternative to the Chinese-leased Port of Darwin. Joyce said the government was taking the idea of developing the NT and making it happen with “real” funding – and that it was “not about” election promises. “It is about what is actually in the budget. It has been legislated. We’re not playing games with the territory, we are actually doing this,” Joyce said. “We don’t want to play games with our nation.” Federal agriculture minister, David Littleproud, also emphasised the Coalition’s budget commitment, saying it was part of $16.5bn in regional infrastructure spending that was a “L-A-W” commitment to grow the northern Australian and national economies. “We are not running around the country making election promises. This is L-A-W law promises; this is in legislation that we are putting into parliament … L-A-W commitments that are going to put $16.5bn into northern Australia.” While the budget supply bill and legislation to enact the cost of living measures passed parliament in the final sitting week, the appropriations bill which includes the infrastructure funding lapsed at the second reading stage, meaning it is yet to pass the House of Representatives. Littleproud moved to clarify the status of the funding, saying it was the Coalition’s policy and would be legislated if it won government. “We’ve been prepared to put our commitments in legislation before the parliament. If we remain in government we’ll pass the bill,” he said. “The question is: will the Labor party support it?” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Joyce said that the Nationals had bargained hard within the Coalition on behalf of the NT because it was in the best interests of the country, and that now it was up to Labor to match the commitment. “We talked about this two weeks ago, a fortnight ago,” Joyce said. “[Labor] have had two weeks to catch up … to come out and say, ‘We’re not quibbling about this, good idea, we are part of that too and we will do it as well’ – but they haven’t.” Labor is yet to make clear which projects announced by the Coalition it will support, saying it needs more information before declaring its hand. Tuesday’s infrastructure announcement follows scrutiny over the long-term lease of the Port of Darwin to Chinese company Landbridge Group in 2015. The Coalition has so far stopped short of acting to revoke that lease, even amid increasing warnings about its strategic implications. But the Coalition had been widely expected to campaign on additional NT port infrastructure during the election campaign. On budget night, Joyce, said in a media release that the government would invest $1.5bn in the NT “to build new port infrastructure, such as a wharf, an offloading facility and dredging of the shipping channel, to boost the region’s importing and exporting ability”. However this was not listed as a line item in the budget papers released that night. Defence officials played down the defence aspects of the proposal, noting the NT government had been promoting plans for the trade-focused “Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct” for some time. The NT’s then-Country Liberal party government granted a 99-year lease over the Port of Darwin to Landbridge Groupin 2015. The federal government announced a review of the agreement on national security grounds last year. Foreign minister Marise Payne dismissed a report that Defence’s review had found there were no national security grounds sufficient to recommend a government intervention to overturn the lease. On 1 April, she told Senate estimates the review was “still in process”. Earlier this month, defence minister, Peter Dutton, was asked whether the planned $1.5bn investment in the NT was an alternative to the Chinese-leased Port of Darwin. The government was looking “at port development and ways in which we might be able to support through contracts from Defence, for example, the underpinning of a business model,” he said. “We’ll have more to say about that in due course”. Guardian Australia has previously reported the government was considering options that went beyond the binary choice of keeping or scrapping the Port of Darwin lease. These could include imposing additional requirements on the operator, Landbridge Group, under critical infrastructure laws. Landbridge said last year the company had “acquired the lease to Darwin Port in good faith following a transparent process in 2015” and was willing to assist any review.",News/Australia news,Barnaby Joyce wrongly claims $1.5bn funding for second Darwin port has already been legislated ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/barnaby-joyce-wrongly-claims-15bn-funding-for-second-darwin-port-has-already-been-legislated
4/12/2022,"Britain’s cost of living crisis moved into its fourth consecutive month in February despite a jump in wages and a fall in unemployment to just 3.8%, its lowest level since 1974. The Office for National Statistics said average earnings growth of 5.4%, including bonuses, failed to keep pace with a 6.2% rise in the consumer prices index in February, while for those who missed out on a bonus the situation was even worse after average wages increased by only 4%. The government is under pressure to increase its support to households and businesses after a surge in energy costs that has pushed inflation to its highest level in 30 years. Millions of families have seen their living standards fall since prices began to rise in November after global energy shortages pushed the price of gas to a record high. The minister for employment, Mims Davies, said the fall in unemployment to the lowest point in almost 50 years showed the government’s efforts to increase levels of employment was working. But she acknowledged that it was “a difficult time for many workers and families”. She said: “We’re doing everything we can to help, with our Way to Work scheme which is supporting people coming through the doors of our Jobcentres to move into better-paid, higher-skilled work. As well as increasing the national living and minimum wage, all backed up by over £22bn of targeted investment.” Labour’s Treasury spokesperson, Pat McFadden, said: “Today’s figures show that Conservative choices are leaving real wages squeezed and people worse off. “At a time like this, Rishi Sunak could have chosen a one-off windfall tax on huge oil and gas company profits to cut household energy bills by up to £600. Instead, he’s decided to make Britain the only major economy to land working people with higher taxes in the midst of a cost of living crisis.” Britain’s unemployment rate fell 0.2 percentage points to 3.8% in the three months to February, taking it further below its level immediately before the coronavirus pandemic, the ONS said. Employment was up by 10,000 in the December-February period, driven by a rise in full-time employment that was offset by an almost equal decline in part-time work. The number of job vacancies hit a record high of 1.288m, a reminder of the potential inflationary heat in the labour market that has the Bank of England on alert as it raises interest rates.A separate measures of the number of staff on businesses’ payrolls in March rose by 35,000. February’s increase was revised down to 174,000, from an original reading of 275,000. Darren Morgan, the director of economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), said: “Overall, employment in December-February was little changed on the previous three months, and so is still below its pre-pandemic level. “While unemployment has fallen again, we are still seeing rising numbers of people disengaging from the labour market, and as they aren’t working or looking for work, are not counted as unemployed. “Early estimates suggest there was only a small increase in the number of employees on payroll in March, while job vacancies, although again at a record high, rose at their slowest for nearly a year. “While strong bonuses continue to mitigate the effects of rising prices on people’s total earnings, basic pay is now falling noticeably in real terms.”",News/Business,Jump in UK wages fails to keep pace with cost of living,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/12/jump-uk-wages-fails-ease-cost-living-crisis-prices
4/12/2022,"Politics is in many ways a game of contrasts. Just days after the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s controversial national insurance hike kicked in this month, it emerged that his multimillionaire wife, Akshata Murty, has been using non-domicile status to potentially avoid paying tens of millions of pounds in tax, while Sunak himself had a US green card while he was chancellor of the exchequer. Murty has now said she will pay tax in the UK on her worldwide income after pressure, but the message from the chancellor is clear: tax is very much for ordinary people. That the Sunak family are said to have sacrificed their trip to their California home this Easter in order to lay low in their Yorkshire mansion (soon to have a swimming pool and tennis court) is hardly better optics. While the chancellor chooses between homes to relax in, the anxious British public are turning off the heating and putting on another jumper. This growing story is about ethics and accountability, and the delicate matter of when a politician’s family becomes fair game (clue: when it involves HMRC and you are the one that sets tax policy). Following pressure from both Labour and the Liberal Democrats, Sunak referred himself to be investigated into whether he has broken the ministerial code. Although, the chancellor has now himself requested an independent review of all his declarations since becoming a minister. And yet, in a nation grappling with plummeting living standards, the storm also brings home the perverse reality this country is facing: the worst cost of living crisis in a generation is being overseen by a chancellor whose wife is richer than the Queen. It is hardly a new phenomenon for Britain to be ruled by the wealthy. It is practically in our democracy’s DNA; just look at Eton’s direct tunnel to No 10. It’s not as if Boris Johnson has ever appeared a man of the people, and it has not harmed him electorally. But elitism that can be rationalised away in easier times becomes hard to ignore in times of economic crisis, just as Sunak’s extreme wealth feels uniquely alien even to comfortably off voters. Besides, extreme wealth has a habit of bringing up other issues the public cares about – namely how you came to have it, including adopting questionable tax arrangements. The pictures of Sunak last month struggling to use a card machine to pay for some petrol, and the report that the “average car” he used in a photo op had to be borrowed from a supermarket worker, did not gain traction just because they were a funny sideshow, but because they go to the heart of a question that feels suddenly relevant. Does the man in charge of the country’s finances as prices soar understand the problems facing my family? As one of his constituents put it to the Guardian: “The cost of everything is going up. It costs me £30 a week to drive to work now – that’s three hours wages for me. Sunak hasn’t got a clue.” Those who lament that critics are obsessed with Sunak’s money miss the point. It is not Sunak’s family’s wealth per se that most people object to – it’s what he chooses to do with it, be it limiting the amount of tax his family pays or using his privilege to make other families poorer. His mini budget last month was remarkable even by Tory standards in its indifference in tackling even the edges of the suffering facing much of the public. This failure was only exacerbated by Sunak’s quip that his household “all have different breads” while other families worried about needing a food bank. Overnight, the man who rode high throughout the pandemic with “eat out to help out” may as well have been opining, “eat less to help the bills out”. The thing about entitlement is that Sunak – highly ambitious and previously praised for his slick PR – is not even trying to hide it. Just days after he refused to bring benefit rates in line with inflation to protect children from going hungry, he publicly donated £100,000 to his old private school. Sunak has similarly gone on the offensive in recent days, finding the nerve to spin his current troubles as a leftwing attempt to “smear my wife”. Tellingly, he turned to the Sun – itself a tax-minimising entity owned by a billionaire – to blame Labour for his problems. The rich really do protect their own. If Sunak appears like a man who thinks he’s untouchable, it may be because he typically would be. It is notoriously difficult to have a real discussion about inequality or excess wealth in Britain. As Matthew Parris put it for the Times this weekend, “Wealth envy shouldn’t bar Sunak from No 10.” This narrative has long worked: as I have written before, focus groups show that voters can be hostile to what they perceive as “attacks on people who have done well”. But just like political careers, opinions that once rode high can sink if conditions change. YouGov polling shows that Sunak’s popularity fell by 24 points after the spring statement, and that was before news broke of his family’s use of a tax haven and green card. Much like Partygate, when it comes to tax voters do not take kindly to the feeling of “one rule for them, another one for us”. Protests about living standards have already been held across the country this month, and it’s not hard to imagine the chancellor’s image gracing placards in the coming months. These are the trials that come with money and power. Sunak may well end up as the face of Britain’s cost of living crisis – just not in the way he intended.

4/12/2022,"I’ve been with my wife for 10 years, and we have a great and loving relationship. She is a wonderful person and a great mum to our two young children. However, I was a virgin when we met in our mid-20s, whereas she had had a few partners and casually mentioned early on that a couple of her previous relationships involved doing things sexually that were wilder and more adventurous than anything we have ever done. She said she wouldn’t rule out doing things like that again, but we never have. I’ve tried to put this out of my mind, as I know it shouldn’t be a big deal, but it doesn’t really work. I’ve never wanted to pressure or guilt her into doing anything, but I would like to experience some of these things myself, and after so long together I can’t help feeling that I must not excite her the way her exes did. Is there anything I can do to stop thinking about this? Partners often bring up real or imaginary past scenarios as a means of seduction, titillation, self-bolstering or to test another’s response. It is most likely that the reality was far less spicy than your notion of it and, in any case, your wife has indicated that is not where her current sexual interests lie. If your real wish is to have a more exciting sex life, your best course would be to begin to gently explore what might be mutually exciting now, rather than obsess about repeating elements of her past. Let go of any notion that you do not excite her as much as her exes. That idea is counterproductive and undermines your sexual confidence. Be patient. Couples who have young children are not necessarily going to be able to experience the kind of peak eroticism they had before – or can have in later times when life is less tiring and family-focused.

4/12/2022,"Bleaching in marine sponges in temperate waters off Tasmania’s east coast has been observed for the first time, with scientists warning the discovery could be an indicator of climate change in deeper reef systems. Researchers at the University of Tasmania’s Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies used seafloor surveys to discover the bleaching of cup sponges in the Flinders commonwealth marine reserve after heatwave events. The sponges, which are ordinarily reddish-purple in colour, live in a mesophotic ecosystem – the twilight zone at depths between 30 metres and 150 metres – that bridges brightly lit shallow waters and the darkness of deep ocean. Images of the bleached cup sponges were captured in 2017 but not analysed until later. The research findings were recently published in the journal Climate Change Ecology. “There seems to be a pattern going on with increased bleaching through time,” Dr Nick Perkins, the study’s lead author, said. Perkins said the bleaching of cup sponges could act “as a canary in the coalmine” to indicate the impact of climate change on rocky reefs in temperate waters. “We haven’t seen any mass mortality of the sponges so far … but it is really important to track what is happening on these deeper reefs.” Sea temperatures off Tasmania’s east coast have risen at nearly four times the global average. The region experienced intense marine heatwaves in both 2015-16 and 2017-18. Neville Barrett, an associate professor who led the seabed monitoring research, said the discovery pointed to the likely impacts of climate change on biodiversity. “As things do warm up with climate change over the next century or two, a lot of these deeper species will move south,” he said. “The biggest problem is that whatever endemic species we’ve got here in Tasmania now, they’ve got nowhere to go as things warm up.” Barrett said sponges played an important role in drawing nutrients from seawater and “converting them into material that feeds reef production”. Off Tasmania’s east coast, the cup sponges support fisheries of rock lobster and striped trumpeter, Barrett said. “Once you get down below the algal zone of 30 to 40 metres, it’s all sponge-dominated seabed. There’s no kelp there.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Images of the cup sponges were captured by autonomous underwater vehicles during surveys between 2009 and 2017. The sponge bleaching was later identified by Phoebe Gallagher, a marine science student, when analysing the imagery. The researchers said more work was necessary to precisely establish the threshold temperature – and duration of warming – that would result in bleaching, as well as how long the bleaching persisted for.",News/Australia news,Bleaching of marine sponges observed in warming Tasmanian waters for the first time,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/bleaching-of-marine-sponges-observed-in-warming-tasmanian-waters-for-the-first-time
