1/17/2022,"Courtney Ireland-Ainsworth made fake Instagram accounts in a bid to frame her ex-boyfriend as a stalker. Her accusations meant that her innocent ex spent 81 hours in police custody, reports say. Ireland-Ainsworth was given ten months in prison and a ten-year restraining order. A 20-year-old British woman is behind bars after she set up more than 20 fake Instagram accounts in a bid to frame her ex-boyfriend as a violent stalker, according to reports. Courtney Ireland-Ainsworth of Cheshire, England, created as many as 30 fake Instagram profiles between July and December 2020, per The Sun. The newspaper reported that she used the accounts to send ""vile"" messages to herself after she split with her former partner Louis Jolly, with whom she had been in a relationship for two years, and claimed that he ran the accounts. Ireland-Ainsworth made ten police statements about her former partner during this time, including a report that he sent a message threatening to stab her in the chest, The Sunday Times reported. She involved family and friends in this particular lie, the newspaper said, asking her mother to call the police and report the fake threatening message. Ireland-Ainsworth also claimed that Jolly videoed her walking on the street, harassed her friends, smashed items in her house, and threw a brick through her grandmother's window, Liverpool crown court heard, per The Times. Jolly was arrested six times because of these false accusations, the newspaper reported, which resulted in him spending 81 hours in custody. He also lost his job following assault and stalking charges, was placed on a home curfew for 12 hours a day, had to wear an electronic ankle tag, and had a stalking protection order against him, according to the local media outlet Liverpool Echo. Jolly told the Echo that the ordeal had a profound impact on his mental health. He said he suffered panic attacks, became suicidal, and needed antidepressants. Court Recorder Ian Harris said that all her allegations had been ""untrue"" and had an ""absolutely shattering effect"" on the victim and his family. Jolly maintained his innocence throughout, per The Times, and was eventually absolved of guilt when detectives unraveled her web of lies. Detectives requested user data from Meta, which owns Instagram. It revealed at least 17 accounts were created using Ireland-Ainsworth's email addresses linked to IP addresses connected to her home phone and cellphone. Ireland-Ainsworth was arrested in December 2020 and confessed to perverting the court of justice. ""She stated her ex-boyfriend Mr. Jolly was hassling her, but to make the police believe it, she sent false messages to the police so that they would take it seriously,"" said prosecutor Paul Blasbery, per The Times. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped the charges against Jolly. On Monday, Ireland-Ainsworth was sentenced to ten months in prison and a ten-year restraining order. According to The Times, she was given a reduced sentence because of her mental health struggles. Her lawyer Jim Smith said his client was immature and diagnosed with ""complex"" post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),"" according to the Echo.

1/17/2022,"Each year, we publish this 2018 editorial from the Charlotte Observer. Its message is as relevant as ever: Martin Luther King Jr. was not a well-liked man. He was one of the most polarizing figures in the United States during his final few years of life. He was not the cuddly creature we re-invent every King Day to lie to ourselves and our kids about how he only wanted us to get along. His approval rating began to rise only after he was no longer here to demand America live up to its ideals. King wanted peace, but not at the expense of equality. He wanted little black girls and boys to play with little white girls and boys, but not if it meant pretending racism didn’t exist. He respected authority, but challenged those wearing badges and carrying batons and sitting in the Oval Office. He wanted moral clarity, not cheap comfort. Were he alive today, he’d still be hated by those wedded to the status quo. Because he’d notice the poor still being vilified as lazy. He’d see large corporations, like Walmart, brag proudly about modest pay increases then quietly announce thousands of layoffs. The GOP would still have enacted a tax law skewed to the rich then pass work requirements for Medicaid benefits – something they have never required of wealthy Americans receiving government largesse. He’d know the government pays private collectors triple what they retrieve in back taxes from the low-income while high-income tax cheats skate. That’s why we should shelve the “I Have a Dream” speech this King Day. It has been used too often as an excuse to not have to face hard truths or fight for the most vulnerable among us.

Let us instead remember when King refused to denounce protesters by saying “a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice and humanity.”

 And when he critiqued capitalism: “Again we have deluded ourselves into believing the myth that capitalism grew and prospered out of the Protestant ethic of hard work and sacrifice. The fact is that capitalism was built on the exploitation and suffering of black slaves and continues to thrive on the exploitation of the poor – both black and white, both here and abroad.” And when he demanded “a radical redistribution of political and economic power.” And when he said, “Whites, it must frankly be said, are not putting in a similar mass effort to reeducate themselves out of their racial ignorance. It is an aspect of their sense of superiority that the white people of America believe they have so little to learn.”   And when he was exasperated by those telling him to wait: “Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.” He wanted justice and peace. If he could have only one, there’s no doubt which he’d choose.",World/Charlotte Observer,Americans reinvented MLK after his assassination.

1/17/2022,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Avoid typhoon in the Philippines. Check. Steer clear of massive California wildfires. Check. Keep away from test missiles in North Korea. What? Wait. As teenage pilot Zara Rutherford flew ever onward in a record-challenging global odyssey, she met little as strange or scary as when she tried to squeeze in between North Korean airspace and a massive cloud threatening to cut off passage for her ultralight plane. “Well, they test missiles once in a while without warning,” Rutherford said. More importantly, she was just 15 minutes from flying over one of the last places one should enter uninvited. So she radioed her control team to ask if she could cut the corner over the isolationist communist dictatorship to get to Seoul. “Straight away they said: ‘Whatever you do, do not go into North Korean airspace!’” Fortunately the clouds cooperated enough and she didn't have to continue the crash course in applied geopolitics. At the age of 19, she is set to land her single-seater Shark sport aircraft in Kortrijk, Belgium, on Monday, more than 150 days after setting out to become the youngest woman to circumnavigate the world solo. American aviator Shaesta Waiz was 30 when she set the previous benchmark. Flying runs in her blood since both her parents are pilots and she has been traveling in small planes since she was 6. At 14, she started flying herself and about 130 hours of solo flights prepped her for the record attempt, which she hopes will also have a bigger meaning. With the final touchdown in a plane that looks like a fly among the giants parked at an airport like New York's JFK, the Belgian-British teenager wants to infuse young women and girls worldwide with the spirit of aviation — and an enthusiasm for studies in the exact sciences, mathematics, engineering and technology. Two mathematical statistic stands our for her — only 5% of commercial pilots and 15% of computer scientists are women. “The gender gap is huge,"" she said. Yet once the canopy closed over her cockpit and another six- to eight-hour flight began, lofty thoughts of global outreach receded as she concentrated on one lonely individual — herself. Using Visual Flight Rules, basically going on sight only, danger lurked even closer than when she would be able to use fancy navigational instruments to lead her through the night, clouds or fog. Crossing northern California from Palo Alto towards Seattle, she headed into the huge wildfires blighting the area. The higher she climbed to avoid the smoke — up to 10,000 feet — the tougher it was to keep her eyes on the ground. “The smoke was building up and up, to the point that the whole cabin stank of smoke and I could not see anything but a burnished orange color,” Rutherford said. She had to abort her route and make an unscheduled landing in Redding, California. Over Siberia, the light played tricks on her vision, sometimes casting doubt whether she saw mountains or clouds. “And for me clouds are a really big deal. Especially in Russia,” with its biting cold. Cutting through such clouds, too much ice might build up on her wings, paralyzing control. “At that point your plane is no longer a plane,” she said. That, or any other mishap, could have happened on a section of the route where she once saw only one village in six hours. “I realized if something goes wrong, I’m hours and hours and hours away from rescue and it was -35 C (-31 F) on the ground. And so I thought, actually, I don’t know how long I can survive -35,"" Rutherford said. She didn't have to find out. The project would have been tough enough in normal times, but the pandemic added another complication — which indirectly led to the North Korean adventure. Alternative plans to go over China to Seoul were ditched when the Chinese refused permission citing COVID-19, which, Rutherford said, ""was slightly frustrating because I’m in the plane at 6,000 feet (around 1,800 meters). I’d be very impressed if I could pass on COVID like this.” Overall, bad weather, a flat tire and visa issues added another two months to the planned three-month project. The Associated Press spoke to Rutherford by telephone in Crete, Greece, and even there, the weather over the Balkans was so awful it delayed her for days. Which gave her time to ponder the fickleness of fate. “When you're fearing for your life, it puts things into perspective a little bit more,” she said. “I mean, a cloud — a cloud — could kill me.” In wealthy nations, “we grow up in a world with a huge amount of safety nets,"" she said. ""Actually flying over Alaska, Russia or Greenland, that’s when you realize — actually, there is no safety net. Like, this is really just me. There’s nobody here to help me if anything is wrong.” The wider world though, which by now has become “this small planet” to her, turned out to hold out much more than fear. She spoke dreamily of the Saudi Arabian desert with its changing colors of sand and rock, the barrenness of northern Alaska, the huge circular Apple Park in Cupertino, California, or the sight of what's been called the world's loneliest house on Iceland's deserted island of Ellioaey. And she's come to appreciate some simpler pleasures too. “Before, it was — yeah — it was about the grand adventure,"" she said. ""But actually I think, you know, watching TV with your cat has its special things as well. It is very unique as well.”",World/Associated Press,"Typhoons, wildfires, missiles: Teen flies solo round world",https://news.yahoo.com/typhoons-wildfires-missiles-teen-flies-075442727.html
