2/21/2022,"The image of the Queen sitting alone while mourning the death of Prince Philip has become a symbol of public sacrifice during the pandemic. And the 95-year-old monarch appears to have been fastidious in abiding by public health guidance, routinely wearing a face mask, scaling-back Christmas celebrations and publicly confirming her vaccination status. However, with continuing very high levels of Covid-19 in the community, even the most cautious are at risk of infection. Throughout the pandemic, older people have been disproportionately at risk from Covid-19. During the first wave, about 10% of those aged 80 years and over who were infected died. And since March 2020, more than 5% of England’s population of those over 90 years old have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. But during the past year, things have improved dramatically for the oldest people in society.  Vaccination has offered a crucial wall of defence. The Queen had her first vaccine in January 2021 and is thought to have had all her follow-up doses. Early on, there was concern that vaccines would be less effective in older age groups due to the immune system being less responsive. And it does seem likely that older people are more susceptible to infection, even when vaccinated. A study of more than 200,000 people published this week, found that older people have significantly lower concentrations of antibodies in their blood after vaccination than younger people and their levels of antibodies wane more quickly. But lower rates of infection suggest that older age groups more than compensate for this higher susceptibility by behaving more cautiously and having fewer social contacts. Protection against severe disease in older age groups appears to be holding up well. Research by the UK Health Security Agency shows that around three months after they received the third jab, protection against mild infection among those aged 65 and over dropped to about 30%. But protection against hospitalisation remains at about 90%. Omicron has also turned out to be a milder variant, with the chance of hospital attendance in those over 70 years being reduced by more than one-third. In January, the prevalence of Covid infections in the over-70 category rose above 3% – the highest at any time during the pandemic – and remain hovering above 2%. But there has not been a huge surge in deaths. Buckingham Palace indicates that the Queen’s symptoms are mild. Even so, there are other protections that the Queen’s doctors may be considering. In a recent trial, the Pfizer antiviral pill, Paxlovid, reduced the risk of hospitalisation or death by 88% when given within five days of symptoms. The pill, along with another antiviral made by Merck, is automatically available to clinically extremely vulnerable people who test positive on a PCR test. Outside this high-risk category, the drugs can also be accessed by those aged over 50 who have a health condition, such as heart disease or asthma, or who are considered by their doctor to be vulnerable, through the Panoramic trial. Doctors also sometimes recommend monitoring for more vulnerable patients using an oximetry device to keep track of blood oxygenation at home. Prof Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert at the University of East Anglia, said someone in their 90s would be at increased risk of severe disease compared with younger people, even if they had been triple vaccinated. Nearly all severe Covid infections begin with mild symptoms, he explained. Prof Hunter told the PA news agency: “With somebody in their mid-90s, even if they’re triple vaccinated you are concerned that they could gradually deteriorate over coming days and so you would need to keep a very careful eye on them. “You would, I think, almost certainly be considering giving anti-viral drugs, of which there are a number around at the moment.” He added: “If you do get them early enough it does reduce the risk of severe disease developing so I would imagine any doctor for a patient in their 90s would be considering giving these antivirals out.” The Queen’s diagnosis comes as the government plans to lift all remaining Covid restrictions, including the legal requirement for people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate, in the coming days.",News/UK news,Royal protection: how much risk is the Queen at from Covid?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/20/royal-protection-how-much-risk-is-the-queen-at-from-covid
2/21/2022,"San Francisco school board members recalled from their posts this week allowed themselves to become distracted by politics, the city’s mayor said on Sunday.  Voters overwhelmingly approved the recall of board president Gabriela López, vice-president Faauuga Moliga and commissioner Alison Collins. The board was enveloped in controversy over Covid regulations and closures; an attempt to rename 44 schools deemed to be named for figures linked to racism, sexism and other injustices, among them Abraham Lincoln; and remarks by Collins about Asian Americans. The mayor of San Francisco, London Breed, spoke to NBC’s Meet the Press. Discussing her obligation to name replacements, she said: “I’m going to be looking for people that are going to focus on the priorities of the school district and not on politics, and not on what it means to run for office, and stepping stones, and so on and so forth. “We need people who want to be on the school board to make a difference, and who meet those qualifications to do the job.” Breed sidestepped suggestions the recall showed voters rejecting progressive policies. “My take is that it was really about the frustration of the board of education [not] doing their fundamental job,” she said. “And that is to make sure that our children are getting educated, that they get back into the classroom. And that did not occur. They were focusing on other things that were clearly a distraction. “Not to say that those other things around renaming schools and conversations around changes to our school district weren’t important, but what was most important is the fact that our kids were not in the classroom. “And San Francisco … we’ve been a leader during this Covid pandemic. In some cases, we have put forth the most conservative policies to ensure the safety of all San Franciscans. And our vaccination rates, and our death rates and other numbers demonstrate that we are a clear leader. “But we failed our children. Parents were upset. The city as a whole was upset, and the decision to recall school board members was a result of that.” School boards have become battlegrounds across the US, often as conservative parents and activists look to control what children are taught and how schools deal with Covid. Breed said: “This is not a Democratic/Republican issue. This is an issue about the education of our children.” She also said parents wanted “someone who is going to focus on … making sure that children get the education that they need in our schools, dealing with the challenges of learning loss, dealing with the mental health challenges that exist”. López, the board president, said her recall was the “consequence” of her “fight for racial justice”, and added: “White supremacists are enjoying this, and the support of the recall is aligned with this.” Breed said: “Well, of course [that’s] not the right kind of reaction. And the fact that we’re still even listening to any of the recalled school board members is definitely a problem. “… This person is making it about them when it really should be about our kids who have suffered, not just in San Francisco but all over this country as a result of this pandemic.” Her host, Chuck Todd, asked: “How much of this was about renaming the schools of George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln, and [Senator] Dianne Feinstein [and] how much of it was also parents upset that the rules were changed at how you got into some specific magnet schools?” Breed said it “was probably both. But at the end of the day, our kids were not in school. And they should’ve been.” “… And yes, of course there were people who were probably upset about some of the proposed changes. But those are discussions that are important to have, but not at the expense of making sure that the priority of what the school district is there to do is met.”",News/US news,San Francisco mayor: recalled school board members were distracted by politics,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/20/san-francisco-mayor-recall-school-board-members-politics-covid-abraham-lincoln
2/21/2022,"The first stop for Ella Fyodorova after she fled her home in eastern Ukraine was a windblown tent camp just across the Russian border, part of a mass evacuation effort that observers fear may become the pretext for Russia to launch a formal intervention in Ukraine. “I wanted to stay, but my husband came home, and said: ‘Get your things together, we’re going,’” she said as she wrestled her two-year-old son into a blue snowsuit to walk to the public toilets nearby.  The recent escalation in fighting had not touched her home city of Starobesheve, she said, but warnings from the Russian-backed separatist government of an imminent attack by Ukraine had driven many families to gather their children and flee. Her husband, who dropped her at the border, had to turn back. Now she sat in the dim light of a medical tent alongside other mothers holding their children, all waiting for the next bus to take them further into Russia. Many left carrying just the basics: clothing, medicine, some food. “I don’t know where we’re going,” she said. “I don’t know anything. Tomorrow we need to start searching for a place to live.” Other evacuees who spoke with the Guardian during a recent trip to the Rostov border region said they left because of the resumption of heavy artillery fire that reminded them of the most dangerous phase of the war in 2014. “It’s dangerous – I live by the airport so I heard salvoes all night… until four in the morning I couldn’t fall asleep,” said Natalia Klimchuk, 35, who was there with her three-year-old daughter. “I got my daughter and said, ‘It’s time to get out of here.’” There is evidence suggesting that the sudden evacuations of the Russian-controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions were planned and likely to have been designed to set the stage for a formal Russian intervention in the country’s east. The leaders of the Russian proxy states in eastern Ukraine filmed their announcements of the evacuations days before they were made public, according to video metadata. But for the women, children, and others who are being evacuated, the result is undeniably real and traumatic, as they arrive by the hundreds in a neighbouring region that appears unprepared for the tide of evacuees. In the early chaos of that effort, some said they felt like pawns in a larger game. “Maybe they’ll shoot and then it will quiet down,” said Viktoria from Donetsk, who was also at the tent camp on the border. “I think it’s a farce, though. Like when there’s a fuss and then that’s all … a staged event.” More than 300 evacuees were sent to the Krasny Desant sanatorium just 20 miles from the border. Inside, children ran through the hallways as their parents filled out intake forms and received small handouts such as sim cards. The grounds were patrolled by police, including at least one officer with an automatic rifle (they forced a Guardian correspondent to leave the sanatorium). In a nearby church, Natalia Chetveryakova, 61, said the seaside camp had housed evacuees in 2014 when the war began in eastern Ukraine and had even hosted refugees in 2008 after the Georgian war. Some said they were happy to be placed so close to the border and were thankful for the stipend of 10,000 roubles (£95) that the Russian government has promised to give to evacuees. Others expected better conditions. Beckoning us into her room, where she was staying with her daughter and granddaughter, Sonya, seven, Lyudmila Barskaya showed off the spartan but liveable conditions with an air of resign. “Here are the beds, and that’s all there is,” she said. “All you can do is cry. I understand that it’s like this for us. But nothing more for the children?” Organisation has been a problem. A day earlier, 150 evacuees from Donetsk arrived at a nearby sanatorium only to be told there was no space for them. “We made a mistake when we chose to leave,” one told a reporter for Meduza. A similar scene unfolded at the Congress hotel in nearby Taganrog, where buses full of stressed and tired evacuees arrived only to be turned away. Other residents in the Russian-controlled territories have decided to ignore the evacuation order and stay at home. “We have been hearing about Ukrainian attacks for years – I don’t think it is different this time,” said Tamara Fomina, 64, a pensioner from Donetsk, the largest city in the region. Almost half of the prewar population of 3.8 million left the separatist-controlled Donbas areas after the unrest in 2014, and those who stayed appeared to be numb to the separatist warnings of a Ukrainian invasion. “This is my home; we have been through a lot. If I die, I die, so let it be! But I am not leaving this house to go to live in some tent in Rostov,” Fomina said in a telephone interview. But many are taking steps to prepare for an uncertain future. After the mass evacuation announcement, photographs showed people standing in long lines to use a cash machine in Donetsk. On Saturday, the central bank of the self-proclaimed Donetsk republic announced a maximum withdrawal limit of 10,000 roubles a day from ATMs. “There are lines everywhere. Lines for gas, for money, for food. People are worried shops won’t buy new supplies,” said Donetsk local Vlada Vologina, 34. Vologina also claimed that public transport in Donetsk was paralysed because authorities used the city’s buses as part of the mass evacuation operation. Some men in Donetsk expressed worry after receiving call-up papers ordering them to report to the headquarters of the local militia on Sunday. “When I came back from work last night, I saw the paper in my mailbox. This is all moving very fast,” said Vadim, who asked for his last name to be withheld. “I don’t know who is at fault for all of this, but I don’t want war. My wife is pregnant and fighting a war was never in my plans,” he added, saying he was still undecided whether he would go to the militia headquarters. Meanwhile, there are signs that Russia is ramping up the evacuation efforts: a local sporting facility has been converted into a makeshift centre for more than 300 evacuees and buses are taking more to a local train station, where they were put on a train destined for Nizhny Novgorod on Sunday. Some of those arriving at the station did not realise they were being sent hundreds of miles north. Some said they believe the latest events will force Russia to step in and officially recognise or even annex the territories that it has run as proxies since 2014. “All of us who left are thinking and hoping that this is the last time,” said Elena Kravchenko, a post office worker from the Starobesheve district. “That [Russia] will come in and clean them out.”",News/World news,‘All you can do is cry’: Donbas evacuees face uncertain future in Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/20/donbas-ukraine-evacuees-face-uncertain-future-in-russia
2/21/2022,"Credit Suisse had a message for investors during its recent earnings call. The bank was planning to change course after a tumultuous 12 months in which it was embroiled in the collapse of the US hedge fund Archegos and the supply-chain finance company Greensill Capital. “This will not be a quick fix, and we expect 2022 will be a transition year,” the chief executive, Thomas Gottstein, said on a conference call on 10 February. “But we have made clear progress in creating the conditions for a much more stable and predictable bank.”  More “predictable”, in banking parlance, was code for reining in its riskier investment bank – which offers trading, fundraising services and deal advice to firms – and pivoting towards a more stable source of income: wealth management. What is the Suisse secrets leak? Suisse secrets is a global journalistic investigation into a leak of data from the Swiss bank Credit Suisse. It comprises more than 18,000 bank accounts that were leaked to Süddeutsche Zeitung by a whistleblower who said Swiss banking secrecy laws were ""immoral"". The data, which is only a partial capture of the bank’s 1.5 million private banking clients, is linked to more than 30,000 Credit Suisse clients. The leak includes personal, shared and corporate bank accounts – holding, on average, 7.5m Swiss francs (CHF). Almost 200 accounts in the data are worth more than 100m CHF, and more than a dozen are valued in the billions. While some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000. Many of those were still open well into the last decade, and a portion remain open today. The Guardian was among more than 48 media partners around the world including journalists at Le Monde, NDR, the Miami Herald and the New York Times. They spent months using the data to investigate the bank, in a project coordinated by Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). They unearthed evidence Credit Suisse accounts had been used by clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes, suggesting widespread failures of due diligence by the bank. It is not illegal to have a Swiss account and the leak also contained data of legitimate clients who had done nothing wrong. In its response, Credit Suisse said it ""strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices"". Yet that pillar of Credit Suisse’s business – cultivating rich clients for a range of banking services – is precisely what has come under the spotlight in the revelations in the Suisse secrets project. A massive leak has revealed that Credit Suisse harboured the hidden wealth of clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes. The revelations point to apparently widespread failures of due diligence by the lender, despite repeated pledges to weed out dubious clients and stamp out illicit funds. In response, Credit Suisse said it was unable to comment on specific clients but “strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices”, which it said were “based on partial, selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank’s business conduct”. However, the simultaneous disclosures by 48 media organisations have raised painful questions for the bank. For anyone who has followed the string of scandals in recent years, they will have a familiar ring. Has Credit Suisse had a high tolerance for risky clients? Has it done enough to strengthen internal due diligence controls? Was there a culture in which bankers held their noses and looked the other way when taking or keeping money from dubious clients, particularly public officials who might have been involved in corruption? Did profit take priority over ethics? In its response to the media, the bank says these are historical matters relating to a tiny fraction of its customers. It says it has kept pace with banking regulations across the sector, putting in place a strict zero-tolerance policy towards tax evasion and stringent control measures to counter money laundering. Yet Credit Suisse has spent decades apologising for past horrors, only for more skeletons to emerge from its cupboards. Its newly installed chairman, Axel Lehmann, will be hoping the Suisse secrets leak will be just another public relations crisis for the bank, and there have been no shortage of those. In the past six months, the lender admitted to defrauding investors as part of the historical Mozambique “tuna bonds” loan scandal and Lehmann’s immediate predecessor, António Horta-Osório, resigned over Covid regulation breaches. But these disclosures also threaten to throw a spanner in the works of an aggressive restructuring plan that relies on squeezing more money out of its wealth management division. Credit Suisse is one of the largest wealth managers in the world, handling more than 1.6tn Swiss francs (CHF) (£1.3tn) for clients. With plans to divert 3bn CHF-worth (£2.4bn) of resources from the investment bank and towards the wealth management in the division by 2024, and hire at least 500 relationship managers to find and serve wealthy customers, the overhaul has been viewed by analysts as a sensible response to recent woes involving complex investment products and its services to hedge funds. Part of the bank’s growth strategy will involve courting clients in emerging markets, where there is a greater risk of corruption. Credit Suisse has struggled in recent years to keep bosses in the job long enough to see through significant changes. But if Gottstein and Lehmann are to regain the trust of markets and regulators, they will have to prove their aversion to dubious clients, no matter how lucrative their accounts may be.",News/News,Credit Suisse leak raises painful questions for the bank,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/20/credit-suisse-secrets-leak-raises-painful-questions-for-the-bank
2/21/2022,"Amassive leak from one of the world’s biggest private banks, Credit Suisse, has exposed the hidden wealth of clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes.

They include a human trafficker in the Philippines, a Hong Kong stock exchange boss jailed for bribery, a billionaire who ordered the murder of his Lebanese pop star girlfriend and executives who looted Venezuela’s state oil company, as well as corrupt politicians from Egypt to Ukraine. One Vatican-owned account in the data was used to spend €350m (£290m) in an allegedly fraudulent investment in London property that is at the centre of an ongoing criminal trial of several defendants, including a cardinal. The huge trove of banking data was leaked by an anonymous whistleblower to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. “I believe that Swiss banking secrecy laws are immoral,” the whistleblower source said in a statement. “The pretext of protecting financial privacy is merely a fig leaf covering the shameful role of Swiss banks as collaborators of tax evaders.” Credit Suisse said that Switzerland’s strict banking secrecy laws prevented it from commenting on claims relating to individual clients. “Credit Suisse strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices,” the bank said in a statement, arguing that the matters uncovered by reporters are based on “selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank’s business conduct.” The bank also said the allegations were largely historical, in some instances dating back to a time when “laws, practices and expectations of financial institutions were very different from where they are now”.

It has almost 50,000 employees, including a significant workforce in Zurich, where the bank is headquartered. However, many of its 3,500 ‘relationship managers’, who find and serve wealthy clients, are spread across the world. The leaked accounts are linked to Credit Suisse clients living in more than 120 jurisdictions, with a concentration of clients in the developing world. Countries with some of the largest number of clients in the data, such as Venezuela, Egypt, Ukraine and Thailand, have long struggled with political and financial elites hiding their fortunes offshore. Guardian graphic. By Niels de Hoog, Ashley Kirk and Paul Scruton. The timing of the leak could hardly be worse for Credit Suisse, which has recently been beset by major scandals. Last month, it lost its chairman, António Horta-Osório, after he twice broke Covid-19 regulations. That capped an unprecedented year of controversies in which the bank became embroiled in the collapse of the supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital and the US hedge fund Archegos Capital, and was fined £350m over its role in a loan scandal in Mozambique. This month, Credit Suisse became the first major Swiss bank in the country’s history to face criminal charges – which it denies – relating to allegation it helped launder money from the cocaine trade on behalf of the Bulgarian mafia. However, the repercussions of the leak could be much broader than one bank, threatening a crisis for Switzerland, which retains one of the world’s most secretive banking laws. Swiss financial institutions manage about 7.9tn CHF (£6.3tn) in assets, nearly half of which belongs to foreign clients. The Suisse secrets project sheds a rare light on one of the world’s largest financial centres, which has grown used to operating in the shadows. It identifies the convicts and money launderers who were able to open bank accounts, or keep them open for years after their crimes emerged. And it reveals how Switzerland’s famed banking secrecy laws helped facilitate the looting of countries in the developing world. When Ronald Li Fook-shiu approached a banker to open an account in 2000, he is unlikely to have been viewed as a run-of-the-mill client. A former chairman of the Hong Kong stock exchange, he was one of the wealthiest people in the city, where he was known as the “godfather of the stock market”. But he was perhaps better known for the time he spent in a maximum security prison. Li’s career had ended in disgrace in 1990, when he was convicted of taking bribes in exchange for listing companies on the stock exchange. However, a decade later Li was nonetheless able to open an account that later held 59m CHF (£26.3m), according to the leak. He has since died, but his case is one of dozens discovered by reporters appearing to show Credit Suisse opened or maintained accounts for clients who had serious convictions that might be expected to show up in due diligence checks. There are other instances in which Credit Suisse may have taken quick action after red flags emerged, but the case nonetheless shows that dubious clients have been attracted to the bank. Like every other bank in the world, Credit Suisse professes to have stringent control mechanisms to carry out extensive due diligence on its customers to “ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld”. In banking parlance, such controls are called know-your-client or KYC checks. A 2017 leaked report commissioned by Switzerland’s financial regulator shed some light on the bank’s internal procedures at that time. Clients would face intensified scrutiny when flagged as a politically exposed person from a high-risk country, or a person involved in a high-risk activity such as gambling, weapons trading, financial services or mining, the report said. Relationship managers were expected to use external sources to verify customers and their risk levels, according to the leak, including news articles or databases such as the Thomson Reuters World-Check platform, which is used widely in the financial services sector to flag when people are arrested, charged, investigated or convicted of a serious crime. Such controls might be expected to prevent a bank from opening accounts for clients such as Rodoljub Radulović, a Serbian securities fraudster indicted in 2001 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the leaked data identifies him as the co-signatory of two Credit Suisse company accounts. The first was opened in 2005, the year after the SEC had secured a default judgment against Radulović for running a pump-and-dump scheme. One of Radulović’s company accounts held 3.4m CHF (£2.2m) before they closed in 2010. He was recently given a 10-year prison sentence by a court in Belgrade for his role trafficking cocaine from South America for the organised crime boss Darko Šarić. Radulović’s lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Due diligence is not only for new clients. Banks are required to continually reassess existing customers. The 2017 report said Credit Suisse screened customers at least every three years and as often as once a year for the riskiest clients. Lawyers for Credit Suisse told the Guardian these periodic reviews were introduced “more than 15 years ago”, meaning it was continually running due diligence on existing clients from 2007. The bank might, therefore, have been expected to have discovered that its German client Eduard Seidel was convicted of bribery in 2008. Seidel was an employee of Siemens. As the multinational’s lead in Nigeria, he oversaw a campaign of industrial-scale bribery to secure lucrative contracts for his employer by funnelling cash to corrupt Nigerian politicians. After German authorities raided the Munich headquarters of Siemens in 2006, Seidel immediately confessed his role in the bribery scheme, though he said he had never stolen from the company or appropriated its slush funds. His involvement in the corruption led to his name being entered into the Thomson Reuters World-Check database in 2007. However, the leaked Credit Suisse data shows his accounts were left open until at least well into the last decade. At one point after he left Siemens, one account was worth 54m CHF (£24m). Seidel’s lawyer declined to say whether the accounts were his. He said his client had addressed all outstanding matters relating to his bribery offences and wished to move on with his life. The lawyer did not respond to repeated invitations to explain the source of the 54m CHF. Siemens said it did not know about the money and that its review of its own cashflows shed no light on the account. While Credit Suisse said in its statement it could not comment on any specific clients, the bank said “actions have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times, and that related issues have already been addressed”. In some instances, Credit Suisse is understood to have frozen accounts belonging to problematic clients. Yet questions remain about how quickly the bank moved to close them. One client, Stefan Sederholm, a Swedish computer technician who opened an account with Credit Suisse in 2008, was able to keep it open for two-and-a-half years after his widely reported conviction for human trafficking in the Philippines, for which he was given a life sentence. Sederholm’s crime first came to light in 2009, when police in Manila raided a storefront purporting to be the local chapter of the Mindanao Peoples’ Peace Movement, and discovered about 17 women in cubicles with webcams performing sex shows for foreign customers. He was convicted in 2011. A representative for Sederholm said Credit Suisse never froze his accounts and did not close them until 2013 when he was unable to provide due diligence material. Asked why Sederholm needed a Swiss account, they said that he was living in Thailand when it was opened, adding: “Can you please tell me if you would prefer to put your money in a Thai or Swiss bank?” Swiss banks have cultivated their trusted reputation since as far back as 1713, when the Great Council of Geneva prohibited bankers from revealing details about the fortunes being deposited by European aristocrats. Switzerland soon became a tax haven for many of the world’s elites and its bankers nurtured a “duty of absolute silence” about their clients affairs. The custom was enshrined in statute in 1934 with the introduction of Switzerland’s banking secrecy law, which criminalised the disclosure of client banking information to foreign authorities. Within decades, wealthy clients from all over the world were flocking to Swiss banks. Sometimes, that meant clients with something to hide. One of the most notorious cases in Credit Suisse’s history involved the corrupt Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda. The couple are estimated to have siphoned as much as $10bn from the Philippines during the three terms Ferdinand was president, which ended in 1986. It has long been known that Credit Suisse was one of the first banks to help the Marcoses ravage their own country and in one infamous episode even helped them open Swiss accounts under the fake names “William Saunders” and “Jane Ryan”. In 1995, a Zurich court ordered Credit Suisse and another bank to return $500m of stolen funds to the Philippines. The leaked data contains an account that belonged to Helen Rivilla, an attorney convicted in 1992 for helping launder money on behalf of Ferdinand Marcos. Despite this, she was able to open a Swiss account in 2000, as was her husband, Antonio, who faced similar charges that were subsequently dropped. It is hard to know how Credit Suisse could have missed the money-laundering case linking the couple to the corrupt Philippine leader, which was reported by the Associated Press. The couple, who could not be reached for comment, were able to hold about 8m CHF (£3.6m) with the bank before their accounts were closed in 2006. One former Credit Suisse employee at the time alleges there was a deeply ingrained culture in Swiss banking of looking the other way when it came to problematic clients. “The bank’s compliance departments [were] masters of plausible deniability,” they told a reporter from the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, one of the coordinators of the Suisse secrets project. “Never write anything down that could expose an account that is non-compliant and never ask a question you do not want to know the answer to.” The 2000s was also a decade in which foreign regulators and tax authorities became increasingly frustrated at their inability to penetrate the Swiss financial system. That changed in 2007, when the UBS banker Bradley Birkenfeld violated Swiss banking secrecy laws to show US authorities how the bank was helping thousands of wealthy Americans evade tax with secret accounts. Birkenfeld was viewed as a traitor in Switzerland, where banking whistleblowers are often held in contempt. However, a wide-ranging US Senate investigation later uncovered the aggressive tactics used by UBS and Credit Suisse, the latter of which was found to have sent bankers to high-end events to recruit clients, courted a potential customer with free gold, and in one case even delivered sensitive bank statements hidden in the pages of a Sports Illustrated magazine. The revelations sent shock waves through Switzerland’s financial sector and enraged the US, which pressured Switzerland into unilaterally disclosing which of its taxpayers had secret Swiss accounts from 2014. That same year, Switzerland reluctantly signed up to the international convention on the automatic exchange of banking Information. By adopting the so-called common reporting standard (CRS) for sharing tax data, Switzerland in effect agreed that its banks would in the future exchange information about their clients with tax authorities in foreign countries. They started doing so in 2018. Membership of the global exchange system is often cited by Switzerland’s banking industry as a turning point. “There is no longer Swiss bank client confidentiality for clients abroad,” the Swiss Bankers Association told the Guardian. “We are transparent, there is nothing to hide in Switzerland.” Switzerland’s almost 90-year-old banking secrecy law, however, remains in force – and was recently broadened. The Tax Justice Network estimates that countries around the world collectively lose $21bn (£15.4bn) each year in tax revenues because of Switzerland. Many of those countries will be poorer nations that have not signed up to the CRS data exchange. More than 90 countries, most of which are in the developing world, remain in the dark when their wealthy taxpayers hide their money in Swiss accounts. This inequity in the system was cited by the whistleblower behind the leaked data, who said the CRS system “imposes a disproportionate financial and infrastructural burden on developing nations, perpetuating their exclusion from the system in the foreseeable future”. “This situation enables corruption and starves developing countries of much-needed tax revenue. These countries are the ones that therefore suffer most from Switzerland’s reverse-Robin-Hood stunt,” they said. The whistleblower acknowledged that the leak would contain accounts that were legitimate and declared by the client to their tax authority. “I am aware that having an offshore Swiss bank account does not necessarily imply tax evasion or any other financial crime,” they said. “However, it is likely that a significant number of these accounts were opened with the sole purpose of hiding their holder’s wealth from fiscal institutions and/or avoiding the payment of taxes on capital gains.” It was not possible for journalists in the Suisse secrets project to establish how many of the more than 18,000 accounts in the leak were declared to relevant tax authorities.

Media partners in the consortium wrote to more than 100 Credit Suisse clients in the data, asking whether they had disclosed their Swiss accounts to tax authorities. Five confirmed they had done so. Six said they were not required to declare their Swiss accounts. No others replied. Ferdinand Marcos may have been Credit Suisse’s most notorious client. He is arguably rivalled only by relatives of the brutal Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha, who is believed to have stolen as much as $5bn from his people in just six years. It has long been known that Credit Suisse provided services to Abacha’s sons, opening Swiss accounts in which they deposited $214m. Credit Suisse was publicly contrite after being kicked off a sustainable investment index over the affair. “We understand that the index was not really happy with us being involved with Abacha – we were not happy ourselves,” a spokesperson said in 1999. “But we have addressed those problems and for several years we have taken internal measures to make sure nothing similar happens in the future.” Banks that enable kleptocrats to launder their money are complicit in a particularly far-reaching crime. The consequences for already impoverished populations can be devastating, as state coffers are siphoned, basic standards are eroded and trust in democracy plummets. Politicians and state officials are among the riskiest customers for banks because of their access to public funds, particularly in developing nations with fewer legal safeguards against corruption. Banks and other financial institutions are required to subject politically exposed persons, or PEPs, to the most stringent checks, known as “enhanced due diligence”. The leaked Credit Suisse data is peppered with politicians and their allies who have been linked to corruption before, during or after they had their accounts. None are as well known as the Marcoses or the Abachas, but several wielded great power in countries from Syria to Madagascar, where they amassed personal fortunes. They include Pavlo Lazarenko, who served a corrupt single year as prime minister of Ukraine between 1997 and 1998 before applying for an account at Credit Suisse. One month after pressure from rivals forced Lazarenko to announce his resignation, he opened his first of two Credit Suisse accounts. One was later valued at almost 8m CHF (£3.6m). Lazarenko was later estimated by Transparency International to have looted $200m from the Ukrainian government, allegedly by threatening to harm businesses unless they paid him 50% of their profits. He pleaded guilty to money laundering in Switzerland in 2000, and was later indicted in the US for corruption and sentenced to nine years in prison in 2006 in relation to bribes received from a Ukrainian businessman. His lawyer said those convictions did not relate to theft of any money from the people of Ukraine. Lazarenko, who reportedly lives in California, has resisted returning to the country, where he still faces accusations he stole $17m. His lawyer said his Credit Suisse accounts had not been accessed for two decades and were frozen in connection with court proceedings against him. It remains unclear why Credit Suisse allowed Lazarenko to open an account and deposit such huge sums in the first place, given his background; before entering politics, Lazarenko was a functionary in charge of a collective farm. Monika Roth, an expert on money laundering and a professor at Lucerne University, said Swiss banks had for a long time struggled to properly challenge politicians and public officials who, after stints in public office on relatively modest salaries, turned up with huge sums to deposit. She said: “Nobody wants to have asked the question: how is that possible?” Around the time it was doing business with Lazarenko, Credit Suisse appears to have also made inroads into the Egyptian political establishment under the dictator Hosni Mubarak, who was president for three decades until 2011. The bank’s clients included Mubarak’s sons, Alaa and Gamal, who established business empires in Egypt. The brothers’ relationship with the bank spanned decades, with the earliest joint account opened by the brothers in 1993. By 2010 – the year before the popular revolt that ousted their father – an account belonging to Alaa held 232m CHF (£138m). After the Arab spring uprisings their fortunes changed, and in 2015 the brothers and their father were sentenced to three years in jail by an Egyptian court for embezzlement and corruption. They say the case was politically motivated, but after an unsuccessful appeal Alaa and Gamal paid an estimated $17.6m to the Egyptian government in a settlement agreement that made no admissions of guilt. Lawyers for the brothers reject any suggestion they were corrupt, saying their rights were violated during the Egyptian case, and 10 years of wide-ranging and intrusive investigations into their global assets by foreign authorities has not uncovered any legal violations. They added that their Swiss accounts had been frozen for over a decade, pending the resolution of investigations by the Swiss authorities. Other Credit Suisse clients linked to Hosni Mubarak were the late tycoon Hussein Salem – who acted as a financial consigliere for the dictator for nearly three decades, amassed a fortune through preferred tender deals and died in exile after facing money-laundering charges – and Hisham Talaat Moustafa, a billionaire politician in Mubarak’s party. Moustafa, who could not be reached for comment, was convicted in 2009 of hiring a hitman to murder his ex-girlfriend, the Lebanese pop star Suzanne Tamim – but his account was not closed until 2014. Another Mubarak henchman to receive Credit Suisse’s banking services was his former spy chief Omar Suleiman. He and his associates are listed in the data as beneficial owners of an account that held 63m CHF (£26m) in 2007. Suleiman was a feared figure in Egypt, where he oversaw widespread torture and human rights abuses. The data reveals Credit Suisse accounts held by several more intelligence and military figures and their family members, including in Pakistan, Jordan, Yemen and Iraq. One Algerian client was Khaled Nezzar, who served as minister of defence until 1993 and participated in a coup that precipitated a brutal civil war in which the military junta he was part of was accused of disappearances, mass detentions, torture and execution of detainees. Nezzar’s alleged role in human rights abuses had been widely documented by 2004, when his account was opened. It contained a maximum balance of 2m CHF (£900,000) and remained open until 2013, two years after he was arrested in Switzerland for suspected war crimes. He denies wrongdoing and the investigation is ongoing. If ordinary Algerians, Egyptians and Ukrainians have reason to complain that Credit Suisse may have aided nefarious leaders, their grievances pale in comparison with Venezuelans. Reporters working on the Suisse secrets project identified Credit Suisse accounts linked to almost two dozen business people, officials and politicians implicated in corrupt schemes in Venezuela, most of which revolved around the state oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). “Corruption has always been around in PDVSA, in varying degrees and levels,” said César Mata-Garcia, an academic at the University of Dundee specialising in international petroleum law. “The words ‘Venezuela’, ‘PDVSA’ and ‘oil’ are an alarm bell for banks.” If so, that does not appear to have stopped Credit Suisse acquiring clients later revealed to be involved in numerous US investigations and prosecutions linked to PDVSA and the looting of the Venezuelan economy. One case involves two US-based businessmen with Venezuelan connections, Roberto Rincón Fernández and Abraham Shiera Bastidas, who in 2009 set about bribing officials in exchange for lucrative PDVSA contracts with the help of an associate, Fernando Ardila Rueda. Among those who allegedly received bungs were the energy vice-minister, Nervis Villalobos Cárdenas, and a senior PDVSA official, Luis De Léon Perez. In 2015, US prosecutors began indicting the participants; court papers make repeated reference to payments into accounts in an unnamed Swiss bank. However, the leaked data reveals all five men had Credit Suisse accounts active at the time of the offences. Of the five, four have pleaded guilty. The exception, Villalobos, is resisting extradition to the US from Spain. Some of the Venezuela-linked Credit Suisse accounts contained enormous sums; Villalobos had as much as 9.5m CHF (£6.3m) in his account and De Léon had as much as 22m (£15.5m). Rincón, the businessman paying their bribes, had more than 68m CHF (£44.2m) in his account as of November 2015, the month prior to his arrest. When Credit Suisse’s ornate headquarters were constructed in the 1870s in Zurich, they were designed to symbolise “Switzerland as a financial centre”. More than 150 years later, Credit Suisse occupies the same grand premises and Switzerland remains a global offshore centre, much as it has done for the last 300 years. It is only in recent decades that Credit Suisse, one of Switzerland’s oldest and most cherished banks, acquired its reputation for calamity. As one commentator observed earlier this week: “The bank boasts that its purpose is to serve its wealthy clients ‘with care and entrepreneurial spirit’, but at this stage most of them would probably be happy if it could just avoid yet another major scandal.” Horta-Osório lasted less than a year before resigning last month. Shortly after Credit Suisse appointed its new chairman, Axel Lehmann, the bank reported a loss of 1.6bn CHF (£1.3bn) in the fourth quarter, in part because it had put aside more than 400m CHF (£320m) to deal with unspecified “legacy litigation matters”. And there is no shortage of those. The scandals involving Greensill, Archegos and Mozambique bonds have dogged the bank over the past year. Over the past three decades, Credit Suisse has faced at least a dozen penalties and sanctions for offences involving tax evasion, money laundering, the deliberate violation of US sanctions and frauds carried out against its own customers that span multiple decades and jurisdictions. In total, it has racked up more than $4.2bn in fines or settlements. That includes the $2.6bn the Swiss bank agreed to pay US authorities after pleading guilty to conspiring to aid tax evasion in 2014; the $536m it was fined by the US five years before for deliberately circumventing US sanctions against countries including Iran and Sudan in 2009, and other payouts to Germany and Italy over tax evasion allegations. Against this backdrop, the Suisse secrets revelations may fuel questions over whether Credit Suisse’s challenges are indicative of a deep malaise at the bank. Jeff Neiman, a Florida-based attorney who represents a number of Credit Suisse whistleblowers, believes the sheer number of scandals involving the bank indicates a deeper problem. “The bank likes to say it’s just rogue bankers. But how many rogue bankers do you need to have before you start having a rogue bank?” he said. Neiman alleges there has been a culture at the bank “which encourages its bankers probably from the top down to hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil, bury their heads in the sand on a good day, and on many days, actively assist folks to skirt whatever the law may be in order to best protect assets under management”.” Such allegations are strongly rejected by Credit Suisse. “In line with financial reforms across the sector and in Switzerland, Credit Suisse has taken a series of significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime,” the bank said in its statement, adding that it upheld “the highest standards of conduct”. Its lawyers said it had fully cooperated with many of the investigations cited by the Guardian and that any past individual failings by the bank did not reflect its current business policies, practices or culture. In November, it announced it would put “risk management at the very core of the bank”. The bank said its “preliminary review” of the accounts flagged by the Suisse secrets reporting project had established that more than 90% of those reviewed were now closed or “were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries”. Of the remaining accounts, which remain active, the bank said it was “comfortable that appropriate due diligence, reviews and other control-related steps were taken, including pending account closures”. The Credit Suisse statement added: “These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit the bank and the Swiss financial marketplace, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years.” The debate over whether Switzerland’s banking industry has undergone sufficient reforms is likely to be renewed in light of the leak. The whistleblower who shared the data suggested that banks alone should not be blamed for the state of affairs, as they are “simply being good capitalists by maximising profits within the legal framework they operate in”. “Simply put, Swiss legislators are responsible for enabling financial crimes and – by virtue of their direct democracy – the Swiss people have the power to do something about it. While I am aware that banking secrecy laws are partly responsible for the Swiss economic success story, it is my strong opinion that such a wealthy country should be able to afford a conscience.”",News/News,"Revealed: Credit Suisse leak unmasks criminals, fraudsters and corrupt politicians",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/20/credit-suisse-secrets-leak-unmasks-criminals-fraudsters-corrupt-politicians
2/21/2022,"This week, England arrives at a moment that will fit the Boris Johnson era to perfection. Even if the pandemic is not quite over – something symbolised by news of the Queen testing positive – everything is being arranged to convince us that it is. On Monday, the prime minister is expected to explain his government’s “living with Covid” strategy, and on Thursday, most remaining Covid rules and restrictions will be lifted. Although Northern Ireland seems to be taking a similar route, Scotland and Wales are once again sticking to more cautious policies, but that is presumably the way Johnson likes it. Here is an opportunity for him to show the libertarian, Brexity backbench hardcore which seems to now run the Conservative party that their home country is blazing a trail towards the dazzling uplands of freedom and easy living, and all is once again well.  Clearly, it isn’t. This latest set of moves only highlights a basic fact of life in early 2022 that has been strangely overlooked. Thankfully, the pandemic is winding down, but after two years of sacrifice, bereavement and hurt, there is no sign of any political payback for what people have suffered. The worsening situation in Ukraine may make such talk look rather misplaced, but we were chivvied through the worst of the Covid crisis with endless comparisons to wartime and the supposed glories of the Blitz spirit, our equivalent of “peace” is impossible living costs, cuts to public spending and the inertia of a government completely consumed with its own problems. If the public mood feels almost numb, this is a big part of the reason why. As ever, the everyday state of things is highlighted by the position of city and local government. A new financial year looms, and any extra money from Whitehall does not meet the rising need for the most basic local services, nor cover financial deficits caused by the Covid crisis (a good example is the loss of town and city centre parking charges). So, Nottingham city council has to hack £28m from its spending, and is shutting children’s centres and youth services. In Sheffield, they are reviewing library services and considering cutting vulnerable people’s home care; in Croydon, the council is about to get rid of the council tax support worth up to £29 a week to thousands of the borough’s most vulnerable people. Tory-run Hampshire, meanwhile, is trying to somehow save £80m over two years, which means cuts to children’s social care, work with young offenders, education services and school transport. Through 2020 and 2021, the government endlessly employed a slogan that had been in sporadic circulation for at least 15 years, and was soon adopted by Joe Biden: “Build back better”. Now, at the very point you might have thought those three words would be more ubiquitous than ever, they are nowhere to be seen. We all know that Covid infections and perhaps death rates were made worse by poor and overcrowded homes, but the Conservative approach to the one thing that definitely needs to be built remains as standoffish as ever. Between March 2020 and April last year, about 6,000 homes for social rent were delivered in England, amounting to roughly one for every 190 households stuck on waiting lists. Our Covid death toll highlighted the often appalling state of public health in the UK, but that issue seems to be simply grinding on. During our three national lockdowns, it was briefly fashionable to focus on the huge sacrifices made by children and young people and imagine some kind of programme of reparations, but nothing has materialised. All told, the government’s pandemic story seems to be yet another case study in that very English habit of undergoing trauma and misery, being reminded that everything rests on the ricketiest of foundations, and then pretending nothing has happened. More than ever, Johnson says whatever he thinks suits the moment and then moves on to something else. But even if he was halfway serious about using the state to radically rebalance the economy and society, Rishi Sunak’s Treasury would balk at the kind of spending involved – and in any case, an ideological shift is afoot in the Conservative party that looks likely to jettison even the meek kind of interventionism laid out in the recent “levelling up” white paper. Johnson’s new chief of staff, the MP Steve Barclay, says that the prime minister is now “taking a close look” at how the government can be hacked back, and that “it is a priority to restore a smaller state – both financially and in taking a step back from people’s lives”. For these Tories, the pandemic’s sudden burst of interventionism and collectivist thinking was terrifying: now they are reaching for the rewind button. Labour clearly has different intentions, but still risks being complicit in Westminster’s state of willed amnesia. Keir Starmer currently seems to be deep into the “I’m not Jeremy Corbyn” stage of his leadership, which is understandable but is also getting in the way of him convincingly speaking to the moment. His three watchwords are “security, prosperity and respect”, all abstract nouns, presumably chosen because they come up in focus groups, but not exactly brimming with meaning or topicality. In a technocratic lingo reminiscent of the 1990s, Labour’s plans for the economy promise a “learning”, “investing”, “innovating” and “trading” Britain, too often omitting the moral aspects of life and work that Covid has pushed to the surface. From time to time, Starmer talks about what we have all been through, but there is still no real sense of a centre-left party confidently speaking to a country reeling from the loss of 180,000 people, and the experience of every aspect of its collective life being upended. If you want to instantly understand the normality we are returning to, consider the weekend’s reports in the Sunday Times about the Conservative party’s “advisory board” of 14 unbelievably wealthy donors, and allegations that some of them lobbied ministers to prematurely relax “measures designed to stop [Covid] transmission”, as well as voicing their opposition to “higher tax for the ultra-rich”. When I read that, I thought straight away of something George Orwell wrote in 1941, about the kind of Tory who believed that when the second world war was over, the country could be pushed “back to ‘democracy’, ie capitalism, back to dole queues and the Rolls-Royce cars, back to the grey top hats and the sponge-bag trousers”. England is a country with a tragic habit of simultaneously being obsessed with tradition and forgetting its own history. It says something about where we have arrived that those words sound less like a blast from the past than a very urgent warning. John Harris is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,A post-Covid world is coming into view  – but where is the payback for two years of death and suffering? | John Harris,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/20/tories-death-misery-spending-cuts-covid-labour
2/21/2022,"In popular culture, there is nowhere safer to stash your cash than the vault of a Swiss bank. From thrillers to spy novels, Swiss bankers are depicted as discreet men in suits who know which questions not to ask. As James Bond quipped in The World Is Not Enough: “If you can’t trust a Swiss banker, what’s the world come to?” Switzerland dismisses such stereotypes as lazy and outdated. But its reputation as one of the premier tax havens has not come out of nowhere. The country has nurtured, codified and even advertised the discretion of its bankers for centuries, enjoying lucrative returns as wealthy elites flocked to the Alps to stockpile their riches.  Over the past decade, however, things have started to change. When Switzerland began requiring its banks to share client data with some foreign authorities under a global exchange system to combat tax evasion in 2018, it was heralded as a watershed moment. Some even called it the end of Swiss banking secrecy. What is the Suisse secrets leak? Suisse secrets is a global journalistic investigation into a leak of data from the Swiss bank Credit Suisse. It comprises more than 18,000 bank accounts that were leaked to Süddeutsche Zeitung by a whistleblower who said Swiss banking secrecy laws were ""immoral"". The data, which is only a partial capture of the bank’s 1.5 million private banking clients, is linked to more than 30,000 Credit Suisse clients. The leak includes personal, shared and corporate bank accounts – holding, on average, 7.5m Swiss francs (CHF). Almost 200 accounts in the data are worth more than 100m CHF, and more than a dozen are valued in the billions. While some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000. Many of those were still open well into the last decade, and a portion remain open today. The Guardian was among more than 48 media partners around the world including journalists at Le Monde, NDR, the Miami Herald and the New York Times. They spent months using the data to investigate the bank, in a project coordinated by Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). They unearthed evidence Credit Suisse accounts had been used by clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes, suggesting widespread failures of due diligence by the bank. It is not illegal to have a Swiss account and the leak also contained data of legitimate clients who had done nothing wrong. In its response, Credit Suisse said it ""strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices"". Our reporting suggests that conclusion was overblown. Swiss banks do share client data with many countries, but many developing nations are excluded from the global exchange system set up to combat tax evasion and fraud. Meanwhile, Switzerland’s famed banking secrecy law – article 47 of the 1934 Federal Law on Banks – remains in force. Those who fall foul of it risk a five-year prison sentence. Not that long ago Switzerland strengthened its banking secrecy law, which had originally applied only to bankers and other insiders. Since 2015, the law could theoretically be applied to any third party who “reveals” or “exploits” a secret that has come from within a Swiss bank. The wording is sufficiently vague that an overzealous prosecutor might think about using it against a journalist exposing wrongdoing by a Swiss bank or its clients. Any such move would be considered a brazen attack on free expression, not least in a country such as Switzerland, which is among the top 10 countries in the World Press Freedom Index. But it is not outside the realms of possibility. The UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Irene Khan, told a reporter in the consortium of journalists investigating Credit Suisse that she was assessing article 47. “I can say very clearly that international law gives journalists the right to publish information that is in the public interest, and financial or banking information can fall into that category, for instance if it concerns public personalities,” she said. “The right to privacy cannot be used as grounds to restrict the right of the media to publish information that may be of public interest.” While far-fetched, the possibility that Switzerland’s prosecutors might use its banking secrecy statute to criminalise journalists led to the decision to protect Swiss media outlets from such a scenario by excluding them from the consortium investigating the leaked data. There were more than 160 reporters from 48 media outlets involved in the Suisse secrets project – but none of them were in Switzerland. Perversely, Swiss citizens wanting to read how the country’s second-largest lender provided services to corrupt leaders and money launderers can do so only via the foreign press. “This law is a massive restriction of press freedom in Switzerland,” said Arthur Rutishauser, the editor-in-chief of Tamedia, which would have been a logical Swiss partner in the project. “The law can protect criminals and their assets. Journalists who try to expose them risk criminal proceedings for doing so.” For media outside of Switzerland, including the Guardian, the country’s radical banking secrecy law was also a consideration, albeit a less direct one. It was among many factors considered when we weighed the public interest case for reviewing the leaked data – and, more recently, decided to publish some of it.

There are legitimate reasons why some Credit Suisse clients might want an offshore account, and it is not illegal to have one – assuming it is declared to the tax authorities. The 30,000 Credit Suisse clients in the leaked data include customers who have done nothing wrong and have an entirely reasonable expectation of privacy in their financial affairs. Their data was never of interest to investigative journalists focused on exposing wrongdoing and contributing to public debate about the banking system. However, decades of scandals have made clear that Swiss banks generally – and Credit Suisse in particular – have attracted illicit funds from tax evaders, kleptocrats and money launderers. Financial crime is a serious issue of global public interest. When it involves corruption in the developing world, the impact on the world’s poorest can be profound. When an anonymous source leaked the Credit Suisse data to Süddeutsche Zeitung, Germany’s largest broadsheet newspaper, they knew exactly what they were doing. This was not a dump of data on the darknet or a sale to the highest bidder. The recipients of the leak – Frederik Obermaier and Bastian Obermayer – are the award-winning investigative reporters behind the massive offshore leaks that led to the Panama and Paradise papers. In leaking the data to them, the source appears to have made a moral choice to circumvent what they said were Switzerland’s “immoral” banking secrecy laws. Months of painstaking reporting have unearthed evidence that Credit Suisse had clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering and corruption. Some were allowed to open bank accounts years after they had been convicted for serious financial crimes. In other cases, the data raises questions about unexplained wealth, or whether Credit Suisse asked basic questions about the origin of a client’s funds. Deciding to publish these stories has been a balancing exercise. On one side: personal issues of privacy, confidentiality and data protection, and a Swiss banking secrecy law that could be used to censor reporting. On the other: the public’s right to know about wrongdoing. And our duty to reveal it. Credit Suisse response to Suisse secrets disclosures available here.

2/21/2022,"Jan Pieńkowski, the beloved illustrator and author of more than 140 children’s books, has died aged 85. Pieńkowski, whose work included the Meg and Mog pop-up books, had been living with Alzheimer’s.  Francesca Dow, the managing director of Penguin Random House Children’s Books, confirmed that he died on Saturday morning. Pieńkowski’s work was often inspired by his Polish childhood and experiences as a wartime refugee. His interest in paper cut-outs stemmed from his time in an air-raid shelter in Warsaw, where a soldier had kept him amused by cutting newspapers into shapes for him. Meg and Mog, completed in collaboration with the late writer Helen Nicoll, was a series of illustrated adventures about a hapless witch and her stripy cat. Pieńkowski said in an interview that the series gave him the opportunity to turn monsters from his childhood into harmless toys. He took his palette from comic strips such as Desperate Dan and Dennis the Menace. After Nicoll died in 2012, Pieńkowski worked on new Meg and Mog titles with his civil partner, David Walser, a translator, artist, musician and writer. “One thing I’ve noticed over the years is that Jan never treats children as children, Walser said a few years ago. “It wouldn’t occur to him to talk down to them, he just behaves perfectly normally … When he works with children, he’s one of them.” For his work as a children’s author, Pieńkowski was awarded the 2019 Booktrust lifetime achievement award, which has in the past gone to some of the greatest names in children’s books, including Shirley Hughes, Raymond Briggs and Judith Kerr. The critic Nicolette Jones, who chaired the judges selecting Pieńkowski for the award, said he “brought magic to children’s illustration”, while her fellow judge, the author SF Said, said “books such as Meg and Mog have shaped so many generations now that they have become part of the fabric of British childhood and culture in general”. Pieńkowski was also twice the UK nominee – in 1982 and 2008 – for the international Hans Christian Andersen award, the highest recognition available to creators of children’s books. He won the Kate Greenaway award in 1971 with the writer Joan Aiken for their second collaboration, The Kingdom Under the Sea, which was composed of eastern European fairytales. He won his second Greenaway award in 1979 for the scary pop-up book Haunted House, which demonstrated his tendency towards the gothic. Pieńkowski was born in Warsaw to a country squire father and a scientist mother. He was three when the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, forcing the family to move around Europe before they eventually settled in England in 1946. In London, he attended the Cardinal Vaughan Memorial school in Holland Park, where he learned Latin and Greek, before going on to King’s College, Cambridge, to study classics and English. He illustrated for Granta magazine and designed posters for university theatre productions. At the beginning of his career, Pieńkowski was employed to draw live on the BBC children’s programme Watch!, before the book world discovered him. Along with Meg and Mog and his pop-up books, he is known for his illustrations of fairytales by Perrault and the Brothers Grimm, The Nutcracker, and The Glass Mountain: Tales from Poland.",Arts/Books,"Jan Pieńkowski, illustrator of Meg and Mog books, dies at 85",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/20/jan-pienkowski-illustrator-of-meg-and-mog-books-dies-at-85
2/21/2022,"In 1962 I was one of eight members of the union drama group at Manchester University, invited to form two guinea-pig teams for a new TV quiz show to be named University Challenge. Sitting at two trestle tables in an empty studio at Granada TV, and with a brief to be a bit “studenty”, we were there to help audition prospective candidates to chair it. No buzzers yet, simply a sharp tap on the table with a pencil.  The winner stood out head and shoulders above the others. Kind, witty, urbane, scholarly, old beyond his years and already in charge of the format, it was, of course, Bamber Gascoigne, setting the show’s tone for the next 25 years.Peter Kenvyn Jones Bamber Gascoigne displayed a sustained commitment to Liberal politics. He regularly put his name to appeals for the Liberal party and, more recently, the Liberal Democrats, seeing a natural connection between his involvement in the world of the arts and Liberal values.Michael Meadowcroft Michael Frayn once said to me of his Cambridge friend Bamber Gascoigne: “Beneath the surface charm is a heart of pure gold. He is one of the best, most morally good, people I know.” I saw an instance of this while preparing to film a National Trust walk at Hadrian’s Wall. A middle-aged woman, tripping awkwardly, broke her leg. In great pain, she surveyed the group, then gestured towards Bamber Gascoigne. He knelt over her, and a whispered conversation followed. Later I asked about it. It seemed that the woman never left home without all her jewellery hidden on her person. Realising that she was about to be helicoptered to an unknown hospital, she thought it safer to entrust her valuables to a wholly good person.

2/21/2022,"The Republican senator Ted Cruz complained on Sunday that Joe Biden’s promise to nominate a Black woman to the supreme court was an instance of racial discrimination – but also claimed the GOP would not drag the eventual nominee “into the gutter” in confirmation hearings.  “Democrats today believe in racial discrimination,” Cruz told Fox News Sunday. “They’re they’re committed to it as a political proposition. I think it is wrong to stand up and say, ‘We’re going to discriminate.’” Biden made his promise on the campaign trail in 2020. Stephen Breyer, the oldest justice on the court, announced his retirement last month. James Clyburn, the South Carolina congressman and House whip, was instrumental in securing Biden’s promise. He has pushed for the nomination of J Michelle Childs, a judge from his state who has also attracted support from Lindsey Graham, like Cruz an influential Republican on the Senate judiciary committee. Childs is reported to be on a short list of three. “This administration is going to discriminate,” Cruz insisted. “What the president said is that only African American women are eligible for this slot, that 94% of Americans are ineligible.” The Texas senator’s host, Bill Hemmer, did not point out that justices have been chosen on grounds of identity before. The last Republican president, Donald Trump, promised to pick a woman to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg, then did so when the liberal lion died in September 2020. Cruz championed the nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, a hardline Catholic conservative. As a result of Trump’s three picks, conservatives outnumber liberals on the court 6-3. The replacement of Breyer, which could be Biden’s sole nomination if Republicans win back the Senate, will not alter that balance. Cruz is an accomplished conservative provocateur. On Sunday, he chose a provocative example of a jurist who he said would not qualify for consideration by Biden: Merrick Garland. “Merrick Garland, whom Barack Obama nominated to the supreme court, was told, ‘Sorry, you’re the wrong skin color and wrong gender, you’re not eligible to be considered.’” Garland is now attorney general, and thus unlikely to be considered for a supreme court seat in any eventuality. Furthermore, Cruz was among Senate Republicans who were not sorry to block even a hearing for Garland when he was nominated to replace Antonin Scalia in early 2016, claiming the conservative died too close to an election for a replacement to be considered. Cruz was also among Republicans who were not sorry to replace Ginsburg with Coney Barrett less than two months before the 2020 election. The Texas senator also said he would consider Biden’s nominee “on the record and I’m confident the Senate judiciary committee will have a vigorous process examining that nominee’s record. And what I can tell you right now is we’re not going to do what the Democrats did with Brett Kavanaugh.” Kavanaugh faced accusations of sexual assault, which he vehemently denied. Democratic failed to block his confirmation. “We’re not going to go into the gutter,” Cruz said. “We’re not going to engage in personal slime and attacks. We’re going to focus on the nominee’s record on substance and what kind of justice she would make. And that’s the constitutional responsibility of the Senate.”",News/Law,Cruz: Biden promise to put Black woman on supreme court is racial discrimination,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/20/ted-cruz-biden-promise-black-woman-supreme-court
2/21/2022,"The good, the bad, the ugly and the frankly confusing combined as Manchester United took a significant step towards Europe and Leeds moved too close to the Championship for comfort. If the latest renewal of one of English football’s greatest rivalries was undeniably exhilarating, depressingly unpleasant undertones resurfaced as missiles were hurled from the crowd with one hitting a mercifully unhurt Manchester United substitute Anthony Elanga in the second half.  While Leeds, albeit briefly, displayed a wonderful defiance to, at one point draw level after falling two goals behind, Jadon Sancho enjoyed arguably his best game for Ralf Rangnick’s side as questions concerning Marcelo Bielsa’s future at Leeds re-surfaced. Manchester United’s first visit to a full Elland Road since 2003 coincided with a day of torrential rain and capriciously gusty winds in West Yorkshire. If the tricky conditions, not least a sodden, pitch, were hostile, so, too was the atmosphere. To say there is a certain antipathy between these two sets of fans would be putting it mildly and a competing soundtrack featuring the Leeds anthem, “Marching on Together” and “Pride of all Europe” from the visitors, only served to heighten the frenetic on-field intensity. With Bielsa’s side struggling to retain possession on the heavy surface, Rangnick’s players exerted the greater control and cohesion. They came close to opening the scoring when the initially influential Paul Pogba – nutmegged a startled Diego Llorente before crossing in Cristiano Ronaldo’s direction. It took an intervention from Illan Meslier’s knee to divert the resultant close range shot. Apparent Ronaldo-centric tensions within Old Trafford seemingly prefaced Rangnick holding a series of tete-a-tete talks with senior players including his No7, Pogba and Harry Maguire last week. Maguire has denied suggestions of a rift with Ronaldo and the pair certainly combined to positive effect as Manchester United took the lead from a Luke Shaw corner. With Ronaldo serving as a decoy, distracting the Leeds defence, and Meslier caught wrong-footed, Maguire was able to head his first goal in a United shirt since January 2021. Back in August, Bruno Fernandes scored a hat-trick as Leeds endured a 5-1 deconstruction at Old Trafford and, shortly before half-time, Rangnick’s attacking playmaker placed himself on the scoresheet here. Manchester United’s second goal was another header - and another reminder for Leeds fans of precisely how much they are missing the injured Kalvin Phillips in central midfield. With Robin Koch having hobbled off wounded, Bielsa lacked an enforcer in that department. Tellingly, Fernandes was left completely unattended as Victor Lindelof’s played a slick one-two with Jesse Lingard and pinged an astute pass towards Sancho. As Sancho, excellent throughout, crossed the alarming lack of home resistance had been fully exposed and Fernandes was entirely unopposed as he glanced a header beyond Meslier from around three yards. By now the initial defiance was evaporating from even the mostly optimistic Leeds fan and Rangnick’s decision to offer Lingard a first Premier League start of the season looked increasingly inspired. At the end of a week in which Bielsa’s future at Elland Road has proved the subject of considerable speculation the Argentinian needed to press a few transformative tactical buttons of his own. Raphinha has been very much Leeds shining light this season but the Brazilian has faded in recent weeks. Even so it was still something of a shock when Bielsa left him on the bench at kick-off and season-ticket holders were clearly delighted to see him step off it after the break. Within minutes everything had changed - partly thanks to Raphinha. First Rodrigo collected the ball from Firpo wide on the left reduced the deficit courtesy of a wickedly swerving cross shot which deceived David de Gea, evading the stunned goalkeeer’s outstretched fingertips. No matter that it looked a bit of a fluke on the part of a forward who has scored far too few goals since his £30m arrival from Valencia, Leeds were back in the game. Almost before Manchester United could regroup, Bielsa’s players had levelled with Raphinha – who else? – tapping in Dan James’s left footed right-wing cross as his supposed marker, Luke Shaw dozed. When that equaliser survived a VAR review occasioned by a foul on Fernandes in the preamble, it would have been no surprise if the celebratory roar was on the other side of the Pennines. Hats off, though, to James though for dodging Lingard and AaronWan-Bissaka before creating a goal scored barely a minute after Rodrigo’s. After Ronaldo had been booked for complaining about the foul on Fernandes, the moment for Rangnick to really earn his money arrived. The visiting manager desired two new faces were needed and duly hooked the fading Lingard and, rather more contentiously, Pogba, introducing Fred and Anthony Elanga. Talk about inspired. Shortly after that switch, a fluid Manchester United counter-attack concluded with Sancho contributing the cutest of lay-offs and Fred volleying a superlative third visiting goal. The only shame was that the celebrations – not to mention the occasion – was scarred by the object thrown from the crowd which struck Elanga on the head. Sadly it did not prove an isolated incident, Maguire having picked another missile up from the pitch as the teams trooped off at half-time before presenting it to Paul Tierney, the referee. Mercifully Elanga was not badly hurt and swiftly dusted himself down before rejoining the increasingly helter skelter, sometimes kamikaze run of play. After watching De Gea did well to divert Stuart Dallas’s volley Rangnick decided caution was called for and replaced Ronaldo with Raphael Varane as his side switched to a back three. All that remained was for Elanga to, appropriately, enjoy the last word, the 19-year-old Swede shooting Manchester United’s fourth goal through Meslier’s legs after an exquisite flick from Fernandes confused Pascal Struijk. When that goal was quickly followed by a foul on Elanga from Firpo, provoking a minor melee it seemed entirely in keeping with the slightly chaotic, mildly manic tenor of this latest episode of an ancient rivalry.",Sport/Football,Fred and Anthony Elanga steer Manchester United to win over Leeds,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/20/leeds-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report
2/21/2022,"LeBron James has spoken about the possibility of playing alongside his son and a return to the Cleveland Cavaliers as he contemplates the final stages of his career. The 37-year-old’s two-year, $85m contract with the Los Angeles Lakers expires next season, meaning he would be a free-agent heading into the 2023-24 season. James started his career with the Cavaliers, who are based a short drive from his hometown of Akron, in 2003 and returned for a second stint in 2014, winning the NBA title in 2016.  “The door’s not closed on [a return to the Cavaliers],” James told The Athletic this weekend, in the run-up to Sunday’s All-Star game. “I’m not saying I’m coming back and playing, I don’t know. I don’t know what my future holds. I don’t even know when I’m free.” One point James was more certain on was his oldest son. Bronny James is a 17-year-old point guard for Sierra Canyon School in Chatsworth, California and is considered one of the country’s best prospects in his age group. He would be eligible for the NBA draft in 2024 when his father will be 39. James told the Athletic he would be willing to take a lower salary to play with his son. “My last year will be played with my son,” James said. “Wherever Bronny is at, that’s where I’ll be. I would do whatever it takes to play with my son for one year.

2/21/2022,"Jan Pieńkowski, who has died aged 85, was a most original illustrator, writer and designer of pop-up books, whose Polish childhood and experiences as a wartime refugee fed into his mesmerising work. He published more than 140 books for children and described the essence of his prodigious output simply as telling stories in pictures. Pieńkowski’s characteristic style is immediately recognisable. For younger readers he worked in bright colours and used bold shapes. For older children, he often used a more varied palette with his trademark colourful ink washes as a background to black paper cut-outs. One of his most successful titles, in collaboration with the writer Helen Nicoll from 1972 until her death in 2012, was Meg and Mog, a series of illustrated adventures about a somewhat hapless witch and her stripy cat. Pieńkowski said in an interview that Meg and Mog gave him the opportunity to use terrible monsters from his childhood and make them into harmless toys.  He won the Kate Greenaway award in 1971 with the writer Joan Aiken for their second collaboration, The Kingdom Under the Sea. This was composed of the eastern European fairy tales that were close to Pieńkowski’s heart and featured an early appearance of his beautiful silhouette illustrations. Their first collaboration was the equally delicately illustrated A Necklace of Raindrops (1968). His interest in paper cut-outs, he said, stemmed from a wartime experience in an air raid shelter in Warsaw, where a soldier had kept the young Pieńkowski amused by cutting newspapers into wonderful shapes. The masterful Haunted House won Pieńkowski his second Greenaway award, in 1979. This deliciously scary yet funny pop-up book changed what could be achieved through paper engineering and he went on to explore this genre with titles including the inventive and funny Robot (1981) and the thrilling Little Monsters (1986). One or two critics questioned the frightening nature of many of his picture books, and he certainly had a tendency towards the macabre and gothic. Another inspiration for Pieńkowski was comics. As he put it, “the violence and hyperbole of the Old Testament stories found an echo in Desperate Dan and Dennis the Menace. They also gave me my palette.” He insisted that children like to be frightened in a safe place, although he did admit that some Slavic folk tales are pretty terrifying. Born in Warsaw, Jan was the only child of Jerzy Pieńkowski, a country squire before the second world war, and Wanda (nee Garlicka), a scientist. It was while being cared for by a neighbour that Jan first encountered the terrifying tales about a Baba Yaga-type figure. The woman would tell him “these totally unsuitable stories, get to a cliffhanger – and stop. I used to have terrible dreams, nightmares, of this witch, always chasing me and trying to put me in a pot … I think in a way she gave birth to Meg.” Rural life on a farm was cut short, however, when the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939. The family moved to Warsaw, where his mother’s family lived, and his father worked briefly as a bailiff. When Jan was five years old, Jerzy, who had helped organise resistance groups, had to go underground for a year. The family then left Warsaw and travelled around Europe, including to Vienna, Italy and Germany, experiencing many hazards. They often lived in extreme hardship, and for a period they were forced to sleep in pits under train tracks. In 1946, they finally moved to Britain. Pieńkowski almost broke down when talking about this time in his life on Desert Island Discs in 2009, saying that shrill sounds and screaming still frightened him. As a young child, Pieńkowski was taught by his mother, who encouraged his passion for drawing and making things. On arrival in Britain, aged 10, he was sent to Lucton boarding school in Herefordshire, and added English to his already fluent German, Italian and Polish. His passion for art developed further after he started life-drawing classes at the age of 13. When the family moved to London, he attended the Cardinal Vaughan Memorial school in Holland Park, where he learned Latin and Greek, before going on to King’s College, Cambridge, to study classics and English. There he got to know Nicholas Tucker, the psychologist, critic and writer on children’s literature, and an enduring friendship began. Although he was studying literature, even then Pieńkowski was busy illustrating for Granta magazine and designing posters for university theatre productions – in the process developing a lifelong interest in stage design. Before Cambridge, Pieńkowski had spent a couple of months in Rome, one of his favourite cities, where he discovered opera. This love of the arts was a constant in his life. In the early days of his career Pieńkowski was employed to draw live on a BBC television children’s programme, Watch!, and it was through that work that he first met Nicoll, then the producer of the show. He also worked in book-jacket design, advertising and greeting cards. After Nicoll died in 2012, he added further Meg and Mog titles with new stories written by his partner, David Walser. Pieńkowski and Walser, a translator, artist, musician and writer, had been together for more than 40 years when they became civil partners in 2005 – as soon as it was possible to do so – settling in Hammersmith, west London. A devout Catholic, Pieńkowski was sorry not to be able to have the union solemnised in church, although his priest said vespers for the couple. He produced several books with religious themes, such as The First Christmas (2014) and In the Beginning (2010), the latter with Walser’s masterful adaptations from the King James bible. Other collaborations with Walser included a take on ETA Hoffmann’s original Nutcracker story (2008), The Glass Mountain: Tales from Poland (2016), and a picture book retelling of Homer’s The Odyssey (2019). Pieńkowski was charming, good humoured and popular, with a streak of eccentricity. He was deeply attached to Britain and enjoyed life in London, but still felt close to his homeland, spoke Polish and had many Polish friends. He had a habit of picking up old discarded clothing and wearing it – probably a leftover from having had so little in the war years. Never without a little black notebook, he was constantly drawing from life. In 2019 he was awarded the Booktrust lifetime achievement award. He is survived by Walser.

2/21/2022,"The messaging around the severity of the Omicron Covid variant and a degree of pandemic fatigue is slowing Australia’s booster rollout, as some Australians shun the third dose. Clinton, who asked for his last name not to be used, is pro-vaccine – he got his first two doses as soon as he could, choosing AstraZeneca because it was slightly more effective.  But because the illness caused by Omicron is less severe than other variants, Clinton has decided not to get the booster. “May as well just wait to catch it, stay home, recover, and enjoy natural immunity thereafter,” he said. “But hypothetically if the ’rona got really mean again I would likely get a booster.” As of Friday, 10,583,499 Australians, or 51% of those aged 16-plus, had received a booster, with analysis from Guardian Australia showing recently the rollout was still lagging at least a month behind the “ideal” schedule. About half of the currently eligible Australians had not received their third shot. The Burnet Institute epidemiologist, Mike Toole, said this time the slow rollout could not be put down to supply issues. “The messaging around Omicron, that it is mild, has inhibited the uptake of boosters for adults and first and second doses for kids,” Toole said. “I think that’s been quite dangerous. The country had 66 deaths on Thursday, 64 on Wednesday, 46 on Tuesday. That’s still a lot of deaths.” He said last week a lab study showed the BA.2 variant was spreading faster, and causing more severe illness than the original version of Omicron. “Third doses in adults and first courses in kids are important to protect us and to get the cases down before another variant hits us,” Toole said. “I think it’s going to put us in a vulnerable position as we approach winter. We could be hit with a double whammy – Covid and a flu outbreak.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Last week Atagi changed its recommendation on vaccines, saying a third dose was necessary to be considered “up to date” with vaccinations and everyone 16 and over is recommended to now get the jab. While states such as South Australia and Victoria have made three jabs mandatory for some workers, a large-scale workplace order is unlikely.

All her four children, aged 8 to 22, have had their childhood vaccinations, but she will not vaccinate the youngest against Covid. She had the first two doses so she could continue to work, but will not be getting her third. “I will not be having a booster and a lot of people I talk to say they aren’t either,” she said. “When is it going to stop, one, two, three, seven, eight, nine ... jabs?” Prof Adrian Esterman, from the University of South Australia, said although some people may have got vaccinated just because of the mandate, forcing people to have a booster shot was not the answer. “I think there are some professions where mandates are essential but they are far and few,” Esterman said. “The vast majority don’t need mandates, we need good public health measures from governments. The messaging has been so poor that people need to be persuaded to have a booster.” He said there were two key areas where the messaging needed to be better. First around the prevalence of long Covid, which can impact even asymptomatic cases. Second around the emergence of new variants like BA.2, which looks to be more severe. “Two doses doesn’t protect you from infection,” Esterman said. “What’s happening now is states and territories are beginning to relax public health measures. We have BA.2 hitting us and potential for more variants. Our numbers have plateaued but they’ll probably start going up again.

2/21/2022,"When does keeping a low profile transition into being forgotten? How much are supporters willing to endure? Can you promote your way into a good product? After a week in which it felt like several tipping points were reached at once, these appear to be the metaphysical predicaments confronting the A-Leagues and its handlers, the Australian Professional Leagues. On Wednesday, the latest symbolic reminder of said malaise was delivered in Sydney’s west at a stadium devoid of fans, colour or atmosphere for Western Sydney Wanderers’ 2-0 A-League Men win over Melbourne Victory. In previous years, this fixture was a bewitching spectacle which consumed supporters and neutrals alike and drove the 22 men on the field to strive for more. But mid-week, two of the league’s most well-supported clubs could attract only 4,231 fans to attend a contest reports described as an “ordeal”. The Wanderers are bad right now, but not that bad.  Only once has the A-Leagues cracked more than 20,000 fans at a game this season and of the teams with actual sample size, only Victory is averaging more than 10,000. Victory games in Melbourne, in fact, make up five of the seven to have lured more than 10,000. Television ratings, even after the behemoth that is the Australian Open has moved on, have been middling to poor. The streaming experience on Paramount+, where most games are shown, is crude to the point where an international viewer watching on YouTube is getting a better experience than someone paying for the service in Australia. Grace periods are a thing but have limits. Of course, to critique in good faith, acknowledgements must be made. Inheriting a league that was fragile even before Covid-19, the APL was dealt possibly the worst hand by the pandemic. Rescheduling has played havoc with the fixture and the national teams, still Australian football’s best ambassadors, have been moribund. The hype train greeting the APL’s arrival possibly gathered unrealistic steam thanks to bombastic statements about handbrakes and the perception that drains in Football Australia and Fox Sports were being jettisoned. Looking at the empty stands of the men’s Big Bash, the A-Leagues are hardly alone in having Covid-driven troubles. But these circumstances, the thin margin for error, make the needless own goals all the more grating. And as “drinks breaks” have continued to be inserted into games shown on Network 10 to allow for advertisements, fan sentiment has begun to bubble over. Football supporters can put up with a lot – they have to in Australia – but having to watch a game be deliberately paused for the benefit of an advertiser is a new one even for them. These breaks in play may be the price required to be on free-to-air TV and exposed to a larger audience, but they come at the cost of what was previously considered sacrosanct to the loyal cohort who stuck with the game. Australian football has a long history of alienating its core supporters in pursuit of a mythical mainstream and injections of capital, and this is seemingly the latest example from a group that promised to be better than that. And despite all the new bells and whistles, the league’s core product – the actual football these breaks are interrupting – feels stagnant. Ignoring the false comparison that is European leagues, the quality of ALM’s play has taken a step back from its heights of the 2011-2015 period. Dour pragmatism and playing not to make a mistake is now the prevailing paradigm. Unfortunately for the APL, any attempts to actively legislate how clubs play would take away from the game’s essence – another intrusion on the sacred pitch – and only alienate further. Better players would help, but there’s been more concrete discussion of foreign signings and marquess than youth leagues and development. These are coming, but when? Meanwhile, in the A-League Women, a day after she scored five goals against Brisbane Roar, Adelaide United’s Fiona Worts was back working her part-time job at a McDonalds. She still isn’t able to develop as a full-time professional, often finds herself kicking off under the harsh early afternoon sun and only gets to play in a 14-game season. Hey, but at least now, as she serves a McFlurry at the drive-through, she gets to call herself an A-League Women player rather than a W-League one. The Matildas remain the best promotional tool the ALW has but, with professionalism and full and home and away uncertain, their harvest is in danger of withering. Ultimately, things should get better. Covid will fade and fans, after watching the AFL and NRL fill stadiums, will return. It is in the APL’s interest to fix this. But hope is not a strategy. Neither is waiting for Covid. And pretending there aren’t issues beyond the pandemic is not helpful.",Sport/Football,A-Leagues ‘drinks breaks’ for ads are a killjoy but so is the football they interrupt | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/21/a-leagues-drinks-breaks-for-ads-are-a-killjoy-but-so-is-the-football-they-interrupt
2/21/2022,"Australia’s largest immigration detention centre is “awash with drugs”, sources inside the Villawood detention centre say, with several detailing an extensive drug-smuggling operation. Photographs from inside the centre show marijuana and “bupe” – buprenorphine, an opioid medication – in numerous compounds across the facility, which currently holds 450 people, in western Sydney.  Sources in the centre say the drug trade is widespread and widely known by staff and detainees. The drugs are brought into the centre by a small cohort of guards, multiple sources claimed. Asked whether any staff had been dismissed over drug importation, Serco – the company contracted to provide “support services” inside Villawood – has confirmed one employee was dismissed and reported to police last year following an investigation into “illegal activity”. Multiple sources, across compounds, have independently detailed one smuggling operation. Those detained at Villawood are given a “buy-up” allowance every week which allows them to purchase incidental and personal items such as drinks, snack foods, shampoo and soap. The goods available through the buy-up are bought by Serco, which recently signed a $715m extension to its contract with the Department of Home Affairs to provide support services inside Australia’s onshore immigration detention network. The Serco contract is ultimately paid for by Australian taxpayers. Each detainee’s weekly “buy-up” allowance is 60 points. A 25g packet of loose tobacco costs 26 points, so a detainee can buy two packets a week. These packets are collected and tightly packed in 5kg express post bags, which are also bought through the buy-up scheme, for 21.5 points. “They pack these very tightly, about 50 packets per envelope,” a source said. “As the tobacco is 25 grams, even when adding in the package weight that is still well below the weight limit. I see two-to-three envelopes leaving my compound alone per week, so I would guess the total leaving Villawood would be a minimum of six to eight. That means between 300-400 packets of tobacco per week.” According to the source, outside the detention centre the tobacco is sold, usually below market price, illicitly by drug dealers, or through “chop chop” shops, and the detainees credited for their supply. That credit is used to buy drugs or other contraband, which is then smuggled into Villawood. With visitors prohibited because of Covid restrictions, drugs are being brought into the centre by a small cohort of guards, multiple sources claimed. When visits were cancelled because of the risk of Covid, there were attempts made to fly drugs in via drones, or throw them over the fences, but these were largely intercepted. One person with knowledge of the trade inside Villawood said he believed the vast majority of drugs in the detention centre were brought in by a small cohort of staff members who were paid for transporting contraband in. The centre is “awash with drugs”, a source from a different compound said. Another said they estimated around $10,000 was traded each week. “And considering in [my compound] alone … one dealer has at least $1,500 in bupe in their room right now. I am guessing that my estimates are at the extreme low end.” A further source said the posted tobacco “grey” market represented only a fraction of the drugs market inside Villawood. “People can get whatever they want inside. The Covid restrictions have not slowed the importation of drugs at all.” Another source said: “I find it ironic that the department that is tasked with intercepting illicit drugs from entering Australia can’t stop the same from entering or exiting their own facility.” People held in detention have consistently registered complaints with Serco and the Australian Border Force (ABF) about the drug trade. Others have written to parliamentarians raising their concerns. A spokesperson for the ABF said all visitors and staff in immigration, along with detainee mail, were subject to screening and that the ABF conducted “intelligence-led searches, screening and seizure activities”. “Where drugs are suspected to be present or located, the ABF will refer information to police for action, including investigation. “Where drug infiltration and supply is suspected, the ABF works closely with its law enforcement partners.” The spokesperson did not answer whether any staff had been dismissed or charged over drugs matters. The proposed Migration Amendment (Prohibiting Items in Immigration Detention Facilities) Bill 2020 would make detention centres safer by expanding agents’ search powers and banning prohibited items, the spokesperson said. That bill would also ban mobile phones, used by detainees to speak with their families and legal representatives. An earlier attempt by the government to ban phones in detention was struck down by the federal court. Introducing the bill to parliament, former minister Alan Tudge said: “One of the most critical challenges in managing immigration detention is the continuing incursion, distribution and use of illegal drugs and contraband items, and associated criminal activity.” A spokesperson for Serco said the company was “strongly committed to providing a safe and secure environment for the people in our care, staff and visitors”. The spokesperson said the majority of those held at Villawood detention had been detained after having their visa cancelled under section 501 of the migration act – on character grounds, generally for criminal activity. Government figures state 285 of the 450 people detained at Villawood are “501” detainees. “Detention facilities do not have prison-like infrastructure and the [Migration] Act does not allow a detainee or their accommodation to be searched for the purposes of finding drugs,” the Serco spokesperson said. “We note there is a bill in the parliament that would allow prohibited items to be seized if they are being used for criminal activity or because they are putting at risk the health, safety or security of persons in the immigration detention facility.” The spokesperson said Serco took allegations of illegal activity seriously. “Alleged breaches are investigated … One employee has been dismissed and reported to police in the past year following such an investigation.” The issue of drugs inside Villawood detention centre has been consistently reported, but details have not been previously revealed publicly. In 2019, video obtained by SBS News shows detainees smoking ice, marijuana and bupe, with one explaining on camera that they usually inject bupe and often share needles. In the same year, the ABC revealed that a global fraud and drug trafficking network was being operated from inside Villawood on smuggled phones. New Zealander Robert Peihopa died inside Villawood in 2016, with the coroner later finding his death was caused by both smoking ice and getting into a fight. Autopsy results showed he died from “methamphetamine toxicity” that had complicated “ischaemic heart disease”.",News/Australia news,"Villawood, Australia’s largest immigration detention centre, said to be ‘awash with drugs’",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/21/villawood-australias-largest-immigration-detention-centre-said-to-be-awash-with-drugs
2/21/2022,"Will this be the aged care election? One would like to think so, given the carnage the federal government has wreaked in the sector.  On Wednesday, Senate estimates heard that so far in 2022, more than 700 aged care residents have perished from Covid, a toll already greater than throughout all of last year. In response to questioning, the aged care services minister, Richard Colbeck, said that “the performance in managing Covid-19 has improved” and then blamed Labor for bullying him. Some might object he hasn’t been bullied enough.Colbeck says any suggestion he has “put his sporting commitments ahead of the health and wellbeing of senior Australians … [was] completely misguided” because his attendance at a Test was “part of his commitments as minister for sport and senator for Tasmania”; he also says he had performed other Covid-related duties on that day and the “Test was a day-nighter [that] did not start until late afternoon”.Nevertheless, the fact remains that, as the wave of fatalities swelled in mid-January, Colbeck declared himself too busy to attend a committee on the crisis … and then spent three days at the cricket.At least Nero gave the Romans some music. Meanwhile, although Scott Morrison pledged to alleviate staff shortages by sending in the ADF (increasingly, an all-purpose remedy for failed policy), aged care providers say they haven’t yet been told how to access the promised help, even as the lack of staff has meant closures. Everybody ages. If they don’t need support now, either for themselves or their relatives, one day they will. At the polls, they’ll vote accordingly, right? Well, it’s not quite so simple. The Adam Smith Institute, a neoliberal thinktank, recently released a paper arguing that to “turbocharge scientific discovery and give all humanity a greater stake in space exploration”, the moon should be privatised (yes, really!). Back here on planet Earth, most of us recognise that while Elon Musk might do well from unregulated market forces, the weak and the poor do not. Yet for decades, Australia has relied on Adam Smith’s invisible hand to look after elderly people, with John Howard’s Aged Care Act in 1997 inviting big business to make money from the nation’s most vulnerable people. The results have been much as you’d predict. The report from the royal commission into aged care quality and safety described an absolute horror show: residents lying in their own filth, widespread malnutrition, rampant over-medication, sexual and physical assaults, underpaid and undervalued staff and much else besides. The prime minister launched that inquiry in 2018, explaining, in characteristic Morrisonese, that he wanted to be “fair dinkum” about understanding the full extent of the problems. But here’s the thing, since 1997, we’ve had no less than 18 major reviews and investigations into aged care. In other words, everyone knows the system’s stuffed – and they have for a long, long time. Yet that awareness hasn’t translated into political action. In 2020, when Catholic Health Australia polled voters in Eden Monaro, 84% of respondents described aged care as “in crisis”. Yet, asked to list the issues that mattered to them, less than 4% nominated the treatment of elderly people. We might blame an innate reluctance to dwell on old age and the various indignities it brings. But actually, there’s nothing inevitable about it at all. Other cultures, in other times, have venerated seniors, taking collective pride in the respect they accord to elderly people. It’s more accurate to attribute our indifference to the priorities of an atomised society, in which the value of an individual decreases precipitously once they’re no longer consider an economic asset. And, just possibly, attitudes are changing. The Covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc in aged care. But it also showed that the vast majority of the public wanted to safeguard older citizens and were prepared to alter their behaviour (by getting vaccinated, wearing masks, etc) to do so. In particular, younger Australians – many of whom weren’t necessarily at great risk themselves – accepted significant sacrifices in the fight against the virus. Having done their bit to protect their grandparents, when they get to the polling booth, they may well be inclined to punish Colbeck and Morrison for not doing enough. Of course, much will depend on the willingness of Labor to offer a palpable alternative. In Victoria, the stark contrast between a high proportion of Covid cases and deaths in private facilities and the much less affected publicly run homes shows what could be possible. So far, Anthony Albanese hasn’t offered definite promises about increasing wages to the desperately underpaid staff in the sector. A bold alternative policy would go a long way to putting aged care on the electoral agenda. The hundreds of dead deserve at least that.",Opinion/Opinion,Could this be the aged care election?

2/21/2022,"Companies are facing increasing consumer and shareholder pressure to ensure the investments they make are ethical. But how do they define what’s ethical? Broadly, ethical investment is on the rise. According to the Responsible Investment Association Australasia (RIAA), about $1tn of the $2.24tn in managed funds is classified as responsible. That’s not just because Australians are becoming more aware of the impact their investments can have, but also because responsible or ethical investment is really starting to pay. Sustainable, environmentally friendly and socially conscious businesses are often making essential contributions to our future. Through superannuation, banking and shares, people are actively putting their funds into such ventures.  Unfortunately, there’s no uniform indication of what constitutes “ethical”. There’s also no regulation to clarify what ethical investing is as a basic standard. So you need to navigate the marketing. Ethical screening is generally conducted by fund managers and financial advisers. So, for example, in the case of an ethical superannuation fund, the fund’s managers will establish their ethical expectations and screen prospective companies based on this. Similarly, an ethical financial adviser will have a broad view of what they deem ethical, while also taking their clients’ specific needs into account. If you are investing independently, it will be up to you to decide what’s non-negotiable and what’s acceptable. To give you an idea of how the big superannuation funds and ethical investment firms decide what’s ethical and what’s not, here’s a list of the ways their investments might be screened. It’s still not foolproof, but it’s a start. The negative screening process involves putting companies through assessments to find out if they’re invested in things that people broadly deem unethical. If they produce an addictive product or service (tobacco, gambling), they’re unlikely to get over the ethical hurdle. Likewise, if they engage in poor labour practices, they can be struck off the list of potential investment. Negative screening is a good place to start when deciding what you will and won’t invest in. If you are staunchly opposed to tobacco, obviously you won’t want your investment portfolio to include a company that makes cigarettes. This involves seeking out companies that have good social and ethical values, such as a zero-carbon-emissions policy, a gender-diverse board and exemplary treatment of staff in the production of goods and services. In essence, they turn a profit by doing the right thing. Ideally, they do everything right, but depending on who’s screening, they might only need to meet one or a handful of items in the criteria to make the cut. Companies that perform well in a positive screening process often make a tangible difference to environmental or social outcomes. And, in a perfect world, they’re a good investment too. This might include sectors such as healthcare, education and renewable energy. All super funds, managed funds and exchange-traded fund managers will do a form of screening, but the screens vary and therefore you may also need to apply your own ethical lens to see if it’s a good fit. This approach uses the minimum standard of company, government or international standards. The minimum standards depend on which filter they’re put through. So, for example, they may be subject to assessment based on the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact. These principles are based, in part, on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The principles cover topics such as:  Human rights (non-compliance in human rights abuses)  Labour (recognition of the right to collective bargaining and elimination of compulsory labour and child labour; elimination of discrimination)  The environment (precautionary approaches to environmental concerns, environmental responsibility and the development of environmentally friendly technologies)  Anti-corruption Depending on the fund, or financial product, specific screens will be applied. For example, Verve Superannuation applies a specific gender equality screening. This might be important to you. Alternatively, if you seek vegan and animal-friendly investments, you’d be looking for a specific screen layer. Ethics are personal, and therefore no one broad screen is likely to fit your ethical goals. This is a specific environmental approach, and it means actively seeking out funds or investment opportunities in clean-water programs, renewable energy, infrastructure, recycling, waste management and more. ESG covers environmental, social and governance screening principles. If this is the screen you’re using, you might need to dig a bit to see just how good a company’s governance is. That can mean a fair amount of time and effort on your part: reading company reports, understanding the financial situation and continuing to keep track of the company’s activity once you’ve invested. Because ESG covers these sweeping, general areas, it makes it possible for businesses to claim they’re meeting the ESG criteria when, in fact, it’s a regular business where people are paid the nominated award wages and there’s a recycling bin next to the printer. Perhaps they report on sustainability during their annual general meeting, but potentially there’s little real change being driven. That’s not to say there aren’t companies with a great commitment to ESG, but you need to be comfortable with where they sit on what is a massive spectrum. If you choose impact investing as a key screen, you’re ultimately looking to see physical results from your investment. That might come in the form of improved transport and infrastructure, schools or hospitals. Equally, the impact might be improved social outcomes locally or internationally. Either way, you’ll seek to get a return on investment while hopefully being able to see an actual result. If you’re unsure where to start, an ethical financial adviser could help you establish a strategy. The cost of personal advice can be prohibitive, which means you may have to do your own research. The first step might be to call your superannuation fund and find out where your money is invested. If they can’t tell you, look for funds that can provide more transparency, so you can consider the contents of the portfolios and how they align with your values.
