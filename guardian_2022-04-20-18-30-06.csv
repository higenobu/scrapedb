4/20/2022,"“Russia’s idea is to eliminate Ukraine – and to eliminate Ukrainian culture. If it has no culture, Ukraine does not exist.” That was the sentiment that compelled Pavlo Makov, the official Ukrainian artist at the 59th Venice Biennale, to head to Italy to install his exhibition. Makov and his team, including the curator Maria Lanko, were determined, said Pavlov, “to show that we are here, and we exist. I am not quoting Churchill directly, but he talked about the things that we are fighting for – and we are fighting for our culture, our way of seeing the world.” Makov’s work is called Fountain of Exhaustion – a pyramid of 78 bronze funnels set in tiers, through which water flows. The original idea came in 1995, when, owing to serious floods, the city of Kharkiv lost its water supply for several weeks. When the invasion began on 24 February, Lanko took to her car, with the bronze funnels in her boot. Six days later – the highways having been shelled and the back roads jammed – she made it to the border. In Milan she found a fabricator who could recreate the parts of the artwork that she hadn’t been able to take with her. Makov described how he and his family had initially been reluctant to leave Kharkiv, despite a terrifying period in February when “life was like a pendulum swinging first this way then that – will the war start? Yes, or no.” After a week sleeping in a bomb shelter beneath Kharkiv University’s arts centre, he, his wife, some close friends and his mother (and their cats) took to the road. Having got his mother safely installed in Vienna, he set off for Venice. “I felt I’m not so much an artist, or an individual, so much as a citizen of Ukraine. I felt that Ukraine has to be represented,” he said. The team is also organising the Piazza Ucraina – a temporary pavilion in the Biennale’s main venue, the Giardini, which will host talks “focused”, said Lanko, “on decolonising Ukraine from Russia and giving importance to Ukrainian culture”. In the meantime, the writer and artist Yevgenia Belorusets spent the first 40 days of the war sleeping (or rather, not sleeping) in a corridor in her Kyiv home, as far as possible from any potential breaking glass, “with my computer and hard drive, a charged phone, a passport and documents by my side”. Her diary of the war, accompanied by her simple photographs, is to be shown at This Is Ukraine, an official collateral exhibition of the Venice Biennale. The show’s venue, the spectacular Scuola Grande della Misericordia, is adorned with blue and yellow banners emblazoned with the words “We are defending our freedom” in the handwriting of the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The exhibition is funded by the Ukrainian oligarch and arts donor, Victor Pinchuk. The Russians, by contrast, are conspicuously absent. Their national pavilion in one of the Biennale’s main venues, the Giardini, stands empty after its team resigned. On Tuesday an armed guard was patrolling the building, the property of the Russian state. Absent, too, is Roman Abramovich’s 377ft yacht, in previous years a regular sight. Aside from Belorusets’ diary, This Is Ukraine includes Lesia Khomenko’s huge paintings of ordinary men transformed from their usual lives – chemist, say, or IT consultant – into soldiers. Nikita Kadan’s installations use fragments of twisted, ruined metal he gathered both from the conflict in Donbas in 2014 and from the streets in the current war. One wall is covered with more than 300 photographs of mothers of men who lost their lives in the 2014 war. Damien Hirst has contributed a new blue and yellow butterfly painting. “The cultural front is also a front,” said Björn Geldhof, the director of Pinchuk Art Centre in Kyiv. “There are soldiers defending our freedom every day. We are not all soldiers but we all have a task and a mission.” Pinchuk made his fortune in steel pipes in the years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He is the son-in-law of the country’s second post-Soviet president, Leonid Kuchma, whose regime was repeatedly accused of corruption. This Is Ukraine this year takes the place of the Future Generation art prize, which Pinchuk’s foundation has staged biannually in Venice since 2010.",Arts/Art and design,‘We are fighting for our culture’: Ukrainian artists head to Venice Biennale,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/20/ukraine-artists-venice-biennale-russia
4/20/2022,"Christian Porter’s high-profile barrister should not have been barred from acting for the former attorney general in his defamation case against the ABC because a close friend of his accuser “wishes him ill”, the federal court has heard. Almost 12 months after Sue Chrysanthou SC was blocked from acting for Porter in his now abandoned defamation case against the national broadcaster, the full bench of the federal court heard an appeal over the decision on Wednesday. Brought by Jo Dyer, a friend of the woman who accused Porter of raping her 30 years ago, allegations Porter strongly denies, the case to bar Chrysanthou hinged on a meeting between the two women in November 2020. Dyer’s barrister, Michael Hodge QC, dismissed the argument that she “wishes him ill”, saying the case rested on the confidentiality of the information given to Chrysanthou during the meeting. Dyer alleged that during the meeting – which related to a separate matter – the lawyer was given “confidential information” about the defamation case against the ABC. In May last year Justice Thomas Thawley sided with Dyer and ordered Chrysanthou to relinquish the brief because she held confidential information which was relevant to the case and could present a “danger of misuse”. Days later Porter discontinued the case. Dyer, who is running as an independent candidate in the federal election, was later awarded more than $400,000 in costs over the week-long hearing. But Porter is now appealing the decision, arguing that the judge erred in finding that the information given to Chrysanthou was substantially confidential. Porter’s barrister, Bret Walker SC, argued on Wednesday that it would not have been possible under the cab rank rule for Chrysanthou to turn down the brief on the basis that it would have been “awkward”. “One looks in vein in the rules for any out for counsel that it would be embarrassing to have to take a brief,” he said. “And one certainly looks in vein for any out for counsel that it would be awkward in terms of close professional relations with people you’ve worked with in the past and who you’ll be working against in the current brief. Counsel has to bite the hand that feeds them.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Rather than the receipt of confidential information, Walker argued the case had been brought by Dyer because she “wishes him ill”. “Mr Porter is obviously somebody to whom [Ms Dyer] has exhibited a high level of disapproval, wishes him ill to put it bluntly,” he said. But Hodge dismissed that argument, saying in his reply that the case rested on the confidentiality of the information given to Chrysanthou during the meeting. “It’s not about the idea that there’s a duty of loyalty owed ... It’s about the proposition that a lawyer owes a duty of confidentiality to the client,” Hodge told the court.

4/20/2022,"In 2019 I was fitter than at any other point in my life – and I had a life I loved. It was my third year at the BBC. Every day at New Broadcasting House, I knew that I was seeing world events from a rare vantage point. I loved being surrounded by all the TV monitors and feeling at the centre of things. It had its trials, like any job, but it never stopped feeling like a privilege. Alongside my work, I was an open-water swimmer and had just topped 20 years of swims between islands and across lakes and rivers with an outing in the Galápagos. In the past I’d climbed Kilimanjaro, raced across the Hellespont in Turkey and along the Thames. I swam between the Cyclades in Greece every autumn and loved the Aegean with a passion. I relished returning to London. I was the first at plays and the cinema. I loved clothes; I probably bought too many. At weekends I would run along the river, then have long breakfasts with friends. And, in a way that is now not unusual, I was in better shape at 52 than I had been at 32. When a routine blood test detected my mother’s cancer that spring, it was devastating. The amount of time she had left was uncertain; but I spent it all with her. For months I ate sugary treats left by visitors in that inattentive way we can have when our focus is elsewhere. Uncharacteristically, I neglected my teeth and toothbrushing. So it didn’t surprise me when, by November, I had intermittent toothache in a left molar. An emergency dentist X-rayed it and told me this showed nothing untoward. I was surprised but reassured. In the manner of turning points, I remember that appointment vividly. But three weeks later the pain was constant. Once again the dentist said there was no visible issue, so it couldn’t be dental. I began to suspect, however, that one does not necessarily imply the other. I made it through Christmas, but by the end of January the tooth was agonising, and the gums in my upper jaw had paled, with visibly reduced blood supply. An adjacent tooth began to hurt. These physical changes, after the increased pain, became alarming. The day after my mother died I went to a different dentist. This was the last thing I wanted to be doing. But it was three months since the intermittent tooth pain and I was worried by the further effects I could feel and see. Another “non-definitive” X-ray ensued. Now desperate, I said I didn’t care about the X-ray. I had developed a horribly specific rotting taste. I knew the tooth was necrotic – in other words, dying. I could feel it leaching into the surrounding area and beyond. I begged her to give me a root canal treatment or extract it. These are the only options for necrosis. Without a visible sign this was needed, she refused. Instead, she referred me to my GP, implying my distress was bereavement, an argument it is impossible to beat. By early February, pain in a neighbouring tooth was accompanied by acrid liquid. My gums remained blanched. The top of my left cheek reddened and the skin at the edge of my left eye dried and developed a crust. If a body could scream infection, mine was doing so. The dentist was implacable. The fact several teeth hurt meant she couldn’t “narrow it down” to one. I said it had been just the molar for months, making it more urgent, not less. I begged her to treat it, reiterating the effects on my gums. “Gums can be pale,” she told me. I said mine had not been, before months of dental pain. I was clear that if the tooth went untreated I would end up with multiple necrotic teeth, and my health destroyed. She offered me a night-guard, refusing me treatment. It felt like having gangrene and being offered a bandage. I was four months into my ordeal and facing a pandemic. In the March 2020 lockdown, dentists stipulated emergencies only. Existing X-rays were requested, which I already knew did not show the issue sufficiently. I was referred, against my wishes, to an oral surgeon and facial pain specialist. Neither is relevant for tooth infection. I attended because it seemed the only route to get back to a dentist. The acrid taste grew. Peering over half-moons, the surgeon conveyed the sense of unlimited time to rule things out. He told me I had “atypical facial pain”, perceived as dental. I was clear this would not bring a rancid taste, visible loss of blood supply or discolouration. The second non-dental specialist diagnosed “burning mouth syndrome”, although I had only one of eight symptoms. Over the next four weeks, starting from the false assumption that I was not suffering from a dying tooth – now teeth – every opportunity was taken to refer me to non-dental specialists. I was misdiagnosed as many times. If it hadn’t been so damaging, the refusal to look inside the tooth would have been comic. Did I know what “referred pain” was, the specialists asked? I did. But this wasn’t a case of perceiving more teeth to be affected and being unable to identify which hurt. More teeth were now affected. The surgeon prescribed pain suppressants and duloxetine antidepressants, for three months. He informed my GP surgery, and a doctor who had never met me insisted I take them. It is a particular horror to have no choice over your health when the solution is available. In despair, I took the pills knowing neither treats infection. When I said so to a virtual GP, he told me to double the dose. The leaching sensation increased. Sugarless gum became the only way to reduce the rotting taste from my teeth. Several became dark yellow. Finally, the first dentist agreed to carry out a root canal on the original tooth, only to withdraw this, having attended a dental conference, because “perhaps you need a massage for facial pain”. The tooth remained intact. By April, referred by 111 to a new dentist, I knew not to mention my mother’s death, to avoid further onward referral on the basis this was pain related to grief. Having to start again meant this new dentist did not have direct experience of the progress and impact of the infection. Now, in stark contrast to the previous November, I looked as if I had never been particularly healthy. A 3D scan showed the original tooth to be necrotic, as I had said five months before. Evidence of the infection was clear in the surrounding bone. By the time it is seen in the bone, dental infection is advanced. Molars are our largest teeth and mine had four canals, which had increased its pain and impact. My dentist records that the delay in treating the original dental infection appears to have triggered a systemic response in my body’s autonomic or endocrine system. Having had perfect health, eventually I had to have 12 root canals; all those teeth were necrotic. Few showed up as dramatic issues on X-ray. Before these surgeries, my teeth, bones and skin were affected. My vitamin D levels plummeted. Even my toenails became liable to infection. By June 2020 an MRI showed me to have developed scoliosis, bursitis in my left shoulder and tendinitis in my left hip. Once known for walking at speed, I now inch forward. My skin became sensitive to sunlight. Problems with my circulation, particularly when I face downwards, meant I had to give up swimming. I developed numerous inflammations. Confronted by the facts, the first dentist said that, had he been in his Athens surgery, he would have carried out a root canal on the original tooth. But here, in the UK, he had been concerned he could be held to account by General Dental Council (GDC) regulations, given the X-ray image had not been “definitive”. He had not said this at the time. A doctor and trainee dentist that I spoke to confirmed the chilling reality of “defensive dentistry”, whereby fear of litigation sees dentists offering patients minimal or no treatment when they cannot “justify” the need, largely via X-ray, and particularly seek to avoid doing any endodontic (root canal) treatments in major teeth. I have learned that there is widespread recognition that X-rays do not always capture dental issues. In my case this was disastrous, but should not have been left to become so. The idea that a patient’s worsening dental pain in one tooth, then several, followed by a rotting taste, does not justify physically looking inside the original tooth is dangerously wrong. All characterise dental infection. An editorial in the British Dental Journal (BDJ) as long ago as 2014 described a climate of “fear and distrust” that had led to defensive dentistry because of the prospect of legal action or disciplinary procedures if anything goes wrong. The journal makes it clear this is widespread in the UK. It clarifies that defensive dentistry “does more than prudently assess risk … It shrinks from suggesting, let alone attempting, any action or treatment whether or not it is in the patient’s interest ‘just in case’.” More recently, in 2019, David Westgarth, the editor of the magazine BDJ in Practice, found that “the effects of defensive dentistry are plain to see; clinicians will routinely deny treatments which they could reasonably offer but wouldn’t due to the risk of a possible escalating complaint, even despite mentioning all the risks and gaining ‘valid’ consent”. My own experience extended to hospitals when I tried to seek treatment, in the wake of the dentists’ refusal to provide it. I was referred to the oral medicine department, which offers “non-surgical management of non-dental pathologies”. Withholding of dental investigation and treatment was accounted for, and recorded, by dentists on the basis of my recent bereavement, or facial pain, or neurological possibilities (which did not fit the account I provided). I was then corrected on the order and nature of my symptoms, to fit with these diagnoses. In a letter to the BDJ, a dentist with experience of working in hospitals argued in November 2020 that “the GDC and the medical-negligence lawyers have created a climate of fear and defensive dentistry of unprecedented proportions. I feel that this pattern will continue to evolve to a point where any and all slight variations from the absolutely normal will be referred on to secondary care. The only way to circumvent this inevitability is a fundamental change in the system.” Another BDJ report from 2018, incorporating the views of dentists, found the GDC “has rather perversely created the current threatening environment where many younger dentists find it difficult to adhere to their first commandment, which is ‘to put patients’ interests first’.” My case was a horrific example of excessive diagnostic testing delay, instead of treatment. Months of referrals to neurologists, maxillo-facial specialists, psychologists, GPs, oral medicine departments and other dentists went against common sense and ensured responsibility could never be laid at a particular dentist’s door. Invariably, the first question was: “What did the last dentist say?” Each delay cost me. Arguably, being a woman presented further challenges in securing the correct diagnosis. It would have been entirely different if the dentists’ resistance to doing treatment had been made transparent. In January 2020, my offer to sign a document saying I had asked for treatment after prolonged dental pain, and accepted any outcome if the tooth proved healthy, was refused. To lose one necrotic tooth was nothing compared with the consequences of leaving this dental infection untreated. The afternoon the original dentist told me he would not, after all, treat the tooth I was so upset I rang Samaritans. I knew my health was lost. Two years after the original misdiagnosis, I have no quality of life and am in constant pain. Although the root canal treatments mean my teeth no longer hurt, they were too late to reverse the knock-on effects on my body. I won’t work again, and I look almost unrecognisable. It hurts when I see the faces of former colleagues. Sometimes the careful politeness of friends is worse still. I am alienated from the raucous directness I cherished. It is telling that online searches about dental infections, including their urgency and possible impact, take you to numerous American and continental dental practices and their websites. There is no wilful conflation, as there was in my experience in Britain, of “do nothing” with “do no harm”. Many of us will know of someone whose health was affected by overzealous dentistry. Equal focus needs to be given to the failure to treat where treatment is essential. My nightmares are not of what happened but the dream in which the first dentist, by the third appointment, does the only logical thing and looks inside the tooth. I am saved all further misdirection. What happened to me would have been avoidable if someone had simply listened to what I described, when I described it, and carried out timely action. It wouldn’t have mattered even if I had a bad physical response to the initial tooth infection. I conveyed everything at the time, repeatedly, but was, repeatedly, ignored. It should have been unthinkable.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Dentists would not treat my toothache – now my health has been wrecked for ever,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/20/dentists-would-not-treat-my-toothache-now-my-health-has-been-wrecked-for-ever
4/20/2022,"Geoengineering to prevent the worst impacts of climate breakdown could expose up to a billion more people to malaria, scientists have found. The report, published in Nature Communications, is the first assessment of how geoengineering the climate could affect the burden of infectious diseases. Geoengineering includes removing carbon dioxide from the sky so the atmosphere will trap less heat, and solar radiation management (SRM) – reflecting more sunlight away from the planet so less heat is absorbed in the first place. The latter could be done in various ways, including spraying particles into the sky to reflect the sun away from the earth. This study looked at the latter, specifically injecting aerosols into the stratosphere that reflect incoming sunlight, thereby temporarily “pausing” global warming. Though SRM is often discussed as a way to reduce climate injustice, its potential impacts on health have seldom been studied. Scientists modelled what malaria transmission could look like in two future scenarios, with medium or high levels of global warming, with and without geoengineering. The models identify which temperatures are most conducive for transmission by the Anopheles genus of mosquito and identify how many people live in areas where transmission is possible. They found that in some areas, the high temperatures predicted killed the malaria parasite, so rapidly cooling the area could reverse those declines, leading to a rise in the disease. In the high warming scenario, simulations found that a billion extra people were at risk of malaria in the geoengineered world. “The implications of the study for decision-making are significant,” said Colin Carlson an assistant research professor at Georgetown University Medical Center and lead author of the study. “Geoengineering might save lives, but the assumption that it will do so equally for everyone might leave some countries at a disadvantage when it comes time to make decisions. If geoengineering is about protecting populations on the frontlines of climate change, we should be able to add up the risks and benefits — especially in terms of neglected health burdens, such as mosquito-borne disease.” Other findings include that geoengineering could reduce malaria in some places while increasing it in others. For example, in both scenarios, the authors found that geoengineering might substantially reduce malaria risk in the Indian subcontinent even compared with the present day. However, that protective effect would be offset with an increase in risk in south-east Asia. “On a planet that’s too hot for humans, it also gets too hot for the malaria parasite,” says Carlson. “Cooling the planet might be an emergency option to save lives, but it would also reverse course on those declines.”",News/World news,"Using geoengineering to slow global heating risks malaria rise, say scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/geoengineering-to-slow-global-heating-risks-malaria-rise
4/20/2022,"Researchers in New Zealand are developing a new warning system that tracks shaking within volcanoes and could one day provide two to four days’ notice of whether an eruption is more likely. After the deadly Whakaari eruption in 2019, researchers at the University of Canterbury set out to determine whether patterns in seismic frequency (the shakes felt in the volcano) could help forecast eruptions and prevent the loss of life.Natural Resources Engineering postdoctoral fellow Dr Alberto Ardid studied recordings from GeoNet seismometers – an instrument that measures ground noises and shaking – prior to 18 eruptions across six active volcanoes around the world, including three in New Zealand; Ruapehu, Tongariro, and Whakaari. A machine-learning algorithm allowed Dr Ardid to sift through thousands of recordings and highlight particular frequency patterns that occurred regularly before an eruption. The findings, which are published in Nature Communications, showed that in the three weeks, and then the few days before an eruption, there were similar changes in frequencies within some of the volcanoes. The shakes would become slower – suggesting there was a blockage in the shallow part of the volcano and that a seal or lid had formed, which traps hot gas, builds pressure, and sometimes triggers an explosion. “This pattern started to emerge, in our experience, around three weeks before the eruption and it peaks around two and four days before the event,” Ardid said. “However, it is important to point out that we have observed this sealing mechanism without any eruption related,” he said. Sometimes the pressure will passively release, and other times it can explode. “That’s when it is dangerous.” The research has picked up that Mount Ruapehu, an active volcano in the country’s North Island, is showing signs of a seal forming, Ardid said. “At this point, we’re able to say that an eruption is much more likely to happen now.” Over the past month, strong tremors are becoming more frequent, hot gas and liquid is flowing into the crater lake and sulphur slicks are appearing on the battleship grey water near Mount Ruapehu. GeoNet, which monitors New Zealand’s geological hazards, has issued a warning over elevated volcanic unrest, saying the activity in the last four weeks is “the longest period of tremor recorded over the past 20 years”. It cannot predict if the volcano will blow – unrest does not always lead to an eruption. A tool to definitively predict if a volcano is going to erupt does not exist. As Ardid puts it: “the holy grail of volcanology is trying to anticipate when an eruption is going to happen”. But what this research does is allow scientists to determine with greater accuracy the probability, or likelihood, an eruption will occur. The research’s co-author, Dr David Dempsey, a Civil and Natural Resources Engineering lecturer at the University, said once the warning system has been through enough testing, and the scientists are confident enough in its accuracy levels, it could be used across the world. Dempsey hopes they can get the tool to a stage where scientists can say there is a 10-20% chance of an eruption in the next 48 hours. “That would be considered a very, very high level of certainty.” Determining the relative risk of eruption is important – for example, determining if there is a one-in-10 chance of eruption versus a one-in-1000. “With that information you may or may not decide to delay your visit to a mountain.” New Zealand has 12 active volcanoes and in many cases, including Mount Ruapehu, are popular tourist destinations, or are bordered by residential areas. “Active volcanoes, including Whakaari, Ruapehu, Tongariro, and others around the world where visitors and skiers are likely to be nearby, are unpredictable and sometimes hazardous,” Dempsey said. “Early warning systems could save lives and avoid debilitating injuries.”",News/World news,New Zealand scientists find tremor link that could predict volcanic eruptions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/new-zealand-scientists-find-tremor-link-that-could-predict-volcanic-eruptions
4/20/2022,"The actor and writer Phoebe Frances Brown, who created an acclaimed play about her incurable brain cancer, has died aged 29. Brown starred and wrote in The Glad Game, a one-woman show in which she wanted to demonstrate that “even after receiving the most devastating news, there’s still hilarity and joy to be had”. It was performed in her home town of Nottingham last September. Her agency, Curtis Brown, said they had lost “one of our brightest stars”. The National Theatre, where she performed in Small Island in 2019, tweeted “she has been lost far too soon and our thoughts are with her loved ones”. Brown also appeared at the National in 2018 in If We Were Older, a production in its playwriting programme for schools. Brown’s theatre credits included performing at the Donmar Warehouse and Soho theatre in London, Birmingham Rep, Leicester Curve, the Edinburgh fringe and New York Theatre Workshop. She was part of an all-female comedy troupe, Major Labia, with fellow graduates and associates of Nottingham’s Television Workshop, and was a creative associate of Nottingham Playhouse which called her “kind, talented and funny”. In a message on social media, the theatre added: “She was a big part of our arts community and we’ll miss her. Watching her perform The Glad Game here last year was beautiful.” The Glad Game reopened Nottingham Playhouse in September for its first full season since the start of the pandemic. Three years earlier, Brown had been diagnosed with an incurable tumour in the area of her brain that controls speech, language and memory. She said: “I wanted to write and perform a play about life being stranger than fiction … There’s still things to be glad about.” The play was also streamed online. Nottingham Playhouse’s artistic director, Adam Penford, hailed it as “an honest, frank and funny account of living with a terminal illness”. Pippa Frith, who produced The Glad Game, said that she was proud to have been Brown’s friend and that “her laughter radiated through everything we did together”. Brown was one of 13 writers selected for this year’s Inspire programme at Hampstead theatre, in which a group of writers compose a full-length play mentored by the playwright Roy Williams. In a tweet, Williams said: “I was only just getting to know her but already she was a wonderful presence in the writers’ group.” Brown also acted on radio, playing the role of Constance Pettigrew in the BBC Radio 4 series Home Front and appearing on the BBC mystery The Whisperer in Darkness. She appeared in an absurdist political comedy, Animal Antics, which premiered at the BFI London film festival in 2021. Last month she starred in an Arts Council-supported BBC comedy short called Hung Out to Dry, a western spoof in which she played an unemployed actor competing with her neighbour to see who can hang the washing out fastest.

4/20/2022,"Fake reviews are to be outlawed and consumers will have more chances to get out of subscriptions they do not want under a package of measures proposed by the UK government to stop people being ripped off online. Under the measures, it will be illegal for businesses to pay someone to write or host a fake review for a product or service, and sites hosting consumer verdicts will have to take reasonable steps to check they are genuine. There will also be new, clearer rules for businesses to make it easier for customers to opt out of “subscription traps”, where they are stuck paying for something longer than they want. Companies will be required to remind customers that a free trial or introductory offer is coming to an end, warn them before a contract automatically renews, and will have to allow people to exit a contract in a straightforward way. As part of measures designed to improve consumer protection, the government will give the competition watchdog more powers to tackle rip-offs and poor business practices, including being able to fine companies. If the plans pass into law, the Competition and Markets Authority will be able to enforce consumer law directly, and will have the power to fine businesses up to 10% of their global turnover for mistreating their customers. Previously, consumers have had to take action through the courts, which can be a lengthy process. At a time when many consumers are cutting back on unnecessary spending, amid soaring bills and a cost of living crisis, the government has calculated that the average UK household spends about £900 each year after being influenced by online reviews, while a further £60 is spent on unwanted subscriptions. “No longer will you visit a five-star-reviewed restaurant only to find a burnt lasagne or get caught in a subscription in which there’s no end in sight,” said the consumer minister Paul Scully. “Consumers deserve better, and the majority of businesses out there doing the right thing deserve protection from rogue traders undermining them.” The government has already trailed the fact the measures will also give more protection to users of prepayment schemes such as savings clubs – where people put money aside for Christmas, or to pay for other items, usually over the course of a year – which will have to safeguard customer money through insurance or trust accounts. When the Christmas hamper business Farepak collapsed in 2006, more than 100,000 people were left unable to access the money they had saved, and it sparked calls for greater protection for consumers who use these schemes. Money that people pay into savings clubs is not protected by the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme, unlike cash held in current and savings accounts. The government said the coronavirus pandemic, which prompted a boom in online shopping, had also highlighted bad practices such as fake reviews.",News/Business,UK to make fake reviews illegal and tackle ‘subscription traps’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/20/uk-to-make-fake-reviews-illegal-and-tackle-subscription-traps
4/20/2022,"Some years back, at the Naughty Squirrel backpackers hostel in Riga (twice winner of best hostel in eastern Europe at the Hoscars), I met a small, dark-haired woman in her late thirties. She was laid out on a bottom bunk, her pregnant stomach rising like a child’s drawing of the sun sinking into the sea. We attended some gigs and free walking tours together and hung out at bars with Australians. I asked what she was doing here, why she had come now. She said she was frightened that having a child would erode her personal identity. She was determined to get in all the life she could before that happened. After we parted ways, she texted me asking for every photograph I had from those few days. I imagined her holding a mewling, grasping baby in her arms as she scrolled through images of this now-lost version of herself: warm and rosy, carefree and alone. When I was younger, I made an equivalent vow with my future self. To travel alone (in the UK, in Europe, wherever I could afford) at least once a year, so long as I was able. It was a means of guarding against what I worried I would become: settled, impermeable, inflexible. Like everyone else, I’ve lost out on some years. But I’m back at it now. An unspoken clause in my promise concerned where I would stay. It would not count if I secured myself off behind the card-locked door of some hotel room. Hostels or nothing: that was the deal. John O’Donohue, the philosopher-poet-priest, believed there is a vital tension within the human heart between longing and belonging. To live well, every person requires a form of shelter, a place where they feel at home. But to belong without longing or yearning for some other life would amount to a pale, empty kind of existence. I read O’Donohue’s book Eternal Echoes: Exploring Our Hunger to Belong in spurts from the top bed of a triple bunk in a brightly lit hostel in Galway, my sleep broken by the snores of a man passed out in his jeans two beds beneath me. I remember how obviously true O’Donohue’s words felt. The temporary communities that spring up in hostels expose the human straining between longing and belonging like nowhere else. They are the embodiment of longing, our restless need for new experience. And yet you also find a kind of fragmentary belonging there, breaking up and reforming itself with each new influx of visitors. I was drawn to hostels because they are cheap and because I don’t actually travel alone to be alone. Since then, I’ve found so much else to love about them. I appreciate their uniformity across the world. The same indie-rock time warp pumped through the speakers of the shared living space: Green Day, The Killers and Linkin Park. The same lurid graffiti, cartoonish world maps, (clusters of stickers indicating from where each traveller has come), blown-up stock images of the Taj Mahal and Empire State Building lining the walls. I like how quickly you become a veteran, magnanimously informing bug-eyed newbies which showers are the most powerful or where to get the cheapest interpretation of whatever the local cuisine is here. On entering a hostel, I feel light sensitive, like photographic paper, able to take in clearer impressions of those around me without my own self getting in the way as much. Discussing her Outline trilogy, in which the protagonist, Faye, becomes a filter for the stories of others, Rachel Cusk suggested that a person “could find a different way of living, by a different way of inquiring or listening”. For me, the reversal is true. My diaries from hostels are full of people, not places. Once there, I become a different kind of writer. Earlier this year I stayed at Deep Ellum hostel in Dallas. American hostels have more space: higher ceilings, wider beds. The guests are mostly American, arriving from other states with ambitious plans of starting over – “I’m wiping the slate clean”, they’d tell me, “I’m done with who I was back there.” Most of the friends I made in Dallas worked in the hostel. One would always take the night shift; the two of us would lean against the reception desk chatting from very late to very early. He had dreams of becoming an inventor, hoping to make it big with a new-fangled quasi-health drug he’d come up with, which you could take through a hookah. He asked if I wanted to try it. “Come on: if you die, it will give you something to write about,” he joked. This is not to say staying in hostels feels easy all the time. Plunging lows arrive suddenly, spreading out like concentric rings through water. There are nights that seem to go on for ever, where I don’t have the energy to meet new people and end up the only one in the dorm at 10pm, feeling a kind of teenage embarrassment. Nights where I’m woken at 4am by drunken guests falling over each other into their bunks. Men who have decided my choice to travel alone means I must want some romantic encounter, and I have to skip out of their way at night to find hostel employees I feel safe with. But each new encounter with someone great and surprising feels like an incredible fluke, a stroke of luck. I know the tricks now, too: buy a six-pack of beer and it will guarantee you a good night, the drinks coming back to you in multiples. One time I accompanied an old woman from the bunk opposite me to dinner. We spent much of it leaning over her phone: endless pictures of grinning children and grandchildren. As she was leaving the next morning, she took me firmly by both shoulders and said: “I hope you find what you are looking for.” It was probably innocent, but I felt put out by the statement. I have found what I’m looking for: to keep looking, to go away so I want to come back, and come back to go away again.
