2/17/2022,"Police are investigating the death of a disabled woman in her 20s after what her national disability insurance scheme provider called a “tragic accident”. The chief executive of NDIS provider Live Better, Natalie Forsyth-Stock, confirmed to Guardian Australia on Thursday the woman had “suffered burns” on 2 February while receiving care at a private home in Orange.  The 28-year-old woman, who lived with multiple disabilities, was taken to Orange Base hospital and later transferred to Concord hospital in Sydney where she died on 7 February. It is understood the woman, who has multiple disabilities, was being bathed by staff on 2 February. Forsyth-Stock declined to give specific details about the incident, citing a police investigation, but said “clearly hot water is a risk”. “We know she suffered burns, we know that she passed away after that,” she said in an interview. Forsyth-Stock said she had “apologised to the family many times” and that her “heart really bleeds” for them. “The young lady who passed away was a really beautiful person,” she said. “Everyone in the community is just devastated. It’s a terrible, terrible accident.” Asked if she was confident in the not-for-profit provider’s processes after the woman’s death, Forsyth-Stock said “clearly we will be looking at all our processes from here to see if there is anything we can learn”. “At this stage there is nothing to suggest it was anything other than a really tragic accident,” she said. “The staff were all properly trained. There was no suggestion of fatigue or anything like that. “Clearly hot water is a risk. When you’re working in people’s homes you don’t always have control of the environment. But if there are things we can learn from this, absolutely we can do this.” A NSW police spokesperson said officers were preparing evidence for the coroner. “Officers attached to Central West Police District have commenced an investigation into the circumstances of the death of a 28-year-old woman at a care facility in Orange,” the spokesperson said. “A brief of evidence is being prepared for the information of the Coroner.” Forsyth-Stock confirmed Live Better has reported the incident to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission and Worksafe NSW. A NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission spokesperson said the agency was “aware of this matter and has commenced regulatory actions”. “Our sincere thoughts and sympathies are with the family and friends of the NDIS participant,” the spokesperson said. “As this is a police matter and the subject of our own investigation we are unable to comment further at this time.” In a separate case, the commission last month announced it was suing another provider, the Australian Foundation for Disability, after a woman was found drowned in the bath of her NDIS-funded care home in Sydney in 2019.",News/Australia news,NSW police investigate death of disabled woman after ‘tragic accident’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/17/nsw-police-investigate-death-of-disabled-woman-after-tragic-accident
2/17/2022,"Twitter’s new CEO, Parag Agrawal, is reportedly taking a “few weeks” off for paternity leave after the birth of his second child, a move that drew cheers from other fathers as a positive step towards normalizing men taking time off for childcare. The 37-year-old became CEO of the company in November when its co-founder Jack Dorsey stepped down.  Agrawal’s leave was announced last week but it wasn’t immediately clear when it’s scheduled to begin. Twitter did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for further information. “At Twitter, we encourage and fully support employees taking parental leave in whatever way works best for each person,” Laura Yagerman, the company’s head of corporate communications, told the Washington Post. She added that the decision was “personal” and that the company had designed a program that is “customizable” and can include up to 20 weeks of “flexible” leave. Agrawal’s decision is being lauded by other fathers and co-workers. “Thank you @paraga for leading by example and taking paternity leave,” tweeted Ned Segal, Twitter’s chief financial officer. “I wish leaders did this when I was early in my career and becoming a father.” “Proud that Twitter and our CEO Parag Agrawal are leading the way here, ensuring ALL parents are able to take advantage of this most special time for their families,” Brenden Lee, of Twitter’s corporate communications department, wrote in a post on LinkedIn. Lee’s post drew comments from other fathers cheering Agrawal on. “Kudos to him for leading by example. I remember the guilt I felt when I took a week off following the births our daughters (who are now 7 and 9),” Jimmy Moock, a partner at a PR firm in Philadelphia, commented on Lee’s post. Agrawal’s decision is by no means the norm, with most American men taking less than 10 days off the job, according to the Department of Labor, despite the benefits for both parents and children. But it is another step in a path being paved by other tech leaders, including Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, and the Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. In 2015 and 2017, Zuckerberg took two months of paternity leave after the births of his daughters. Meanwhile, Ohanian has become a champion of the paternity leave movement. Pete Buttigieg, the US transportation secretary, also took paternity leave last fall when he and his husband welcomed their children. He faced a backlash for doing so and addressed it by saying America had a lot of “catching up” to do on the issue. The US ranks among the least generous countries in the world when it comes to paid paternity and maternity leave.

2/17/2022,"Cabinet splits have emerged over the government’s “living with Covid” strategy, with Sajid Javid expected to push to retain some free testing and community surveillance of the virus in the face of a Treasury demand to slash the budget. Ministers including the health secretary and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, are expected to meet on Thursday to discuss the strategy before it is announced next week.  The Guardian revealed this week that Sunak’s Treasury is seeking to cut the budget for remaining Covid provisions by up to 90%, from £15bn this year to as little as £1.3bn in future years. The plans are likely to involve an end to all free PCR testing from March except for 1.3m of the most vulnerable people, as well as in hospitals and high-risk settings, and an end to free asymptomatic testing with lateral flow tests (LFTs). However, there is an ongoing debate over the level of funding for free LFTs for those with Covid symptoms. Whitehall sources said Javid’s Department for Health and Social Care is expected to argue for more money to fund enough testing to ensure the survival of the Panoramic antiviral drugs trial, which officials believe would need free LFTs for over-50s and vulnerable adults under 50 until at least September. The trial will be used to determine who could benefit from lifesaving Covid treatment in the future, potentially expanding eligibility beyond the current 1.3m, although no decision has yet been taken on the cost effectiveness of wider deployment. Javid is understood to have questioned whether free LFTs could be restricted to symptomatic over-70s but was advised a bigger cohort was needed to support the trial. The health secretary is also expected to argue to keep a scaled-back version of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection survey, which was previously reported as likely to lose all or part of its funding. The infection survey shows the prevalence of Covid and is considered a gold standard in the world. Asked whether Javid was pushing to keep some level of free LFTs and the ONS surveillance study amid Treasury demands for a budget cut, a government spokesman said: “We do not recognise these claims. We previously set out that we’ll keep the provision of free testing under review as the government’s response to Covid-19 changes.” Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said on Wednesday that “ending free testing is a mistake, [as] Covid isn’t going away”. “It’s still important that people test if they have symptoms or if they’re going to see someone vulnerable,” he said. “If you take away free tests, that will … make it worse in the long run. It’s not good to get rid of free tests on health grounds nor is it economically the right thing to do.” The lack of settled budget for the next phase of the Covid response has caused uncertainty and low morale at the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA), the body that replaced Public Health England, incorporating NHS Test and Trace and the joint biosecurity centre. It only became fully operational in October last year but is said to be dogged by organisational hurdles and lack of clarity over its budget for the year ahead. Many of its staff are on secondment, fixed-term contracts, or consultants, with doubt over how much longer they will be needed to work for the body as testing is scaled back and contact tracing all but ended. An all-staff UKHSA call on Tuesday led by Jenny Harries, the chief executive, left workers shocked and concerned over whether their jobs would continue past March, with many having previously been told they could expect to see their roles extended to September. In comments submitted to management, and leaked to the Guardian, one worker said: “My staff don’t know if they can pay for their rent and put food on the table in less than six weeks. Having worked incredibly hard, they are dejected by lack of contract security. How can we expect them to contribute to living with Covid strategies and UKHSA transformation activities?” Another of the comments, visible to participants on the call, said: “Unfortunately good wishes and positive feedback doesn’t pay mortgages. The uncertainty is causing us to lose internal staff and affecting confidence from stakeholders.” One said it was “completely unacceptable that so many colleagues have zero clarity on their future roles” and another added: “Have speakers discussed with ministers the impact of this very last-minute decision making on their own staff?” A fifth said: “With all due respect, was the take away message that we have to wait until some time in March to find out if we have a job in April? Thanks.” Matt Hancock, then health secretary, announced the creation of the health body in March, saying: “UKHSA … will be this country’s permanent standing capacity to plan, prevent and respond to external threats to health.” A UKHSA spokesperson said: “We will of course continue to honour all of our staff’s contracts, including notice periods, as we have always done.”",News/World news,Cabinet splits emerge over ‘living with Covid’ strategy and free testing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/cabinet-splits-emerge-over-living-with-covid-strategy-and-free-testing
2/17/2022,"How much snow have you had this winter? Do you think you used to have more snow in the past? Well now you can check what the average annual snow quota is for your area, and compare with the rest of the UK. Using 30 years of Met Office data, the mapping and analytics company Esri UK has created an interactive map, showing the average number of “snow days” – a day with greater than half of the ground covered in snow at 9am – for locations across the UK.  Topping the bill for snowy days is the Cairngorms national park in Scotland, which recorded an extreme 135 snow days in 1986, and is coated with snow for nearly a quarter of the year (86 snow days) on average. At the other end of the scale, the Isles of Scilly have less than one snow day a year, and central London has three. But underlying the 30-year average is a clear warming trend. “Our climate is changing. The UK’s 10 warmest years on record in a series from 1884 have occurred since 2002, and we do see this overall trend in the number of days of snow falling and snow lying,” says Mike Kendon, a climate information scientist at the Met Office National Climate Information Centre.",News/UK news,Weatherwatch: how much snow do you get in your area?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/weatherwatch-how-much-snow-do-you-get-in-your-area
2/17/2022,"In the summer of 2019, months before the word “coronavirus” entered the daily discourse, Diljeet Gill was double-checking data from his latest experiment. He was investigating what happens when old human skin cells are “reprogrammed” – a process used in labs around the world to turn adult cells (heart, brain, muscle and the like) – into stem cells, the body’s equivalent of a blank slate. Gill, a PhD student at the Babraham Institute near Cambridge, had stopped the reprogramming process midway to see how the cells responded. Sure of his findings, he took them to his supervisor, Wolf Reik, a leading authority in epigenetics. What Gill’s work showed was remarkable: the aged skin had become more youthful – and by no small margin. Tests found that the cells behaved as if they were 25 years younger. “That was the real wow moment for me,” says Reik. “I fell off my chair three times.”  A lot has happened since then. Last summer, Reik resigned as the director of the Babraham Institute to lead a new UK institute being built by Altos Labs, a contender for the most flush startup in history. Backed by Silicon Valley billionaires to the tune of $3bn (£2.2bn), Altos has signed up a dream team of scientists, Gill and numerous Nobel laureates among them. They will start work in the spring at two labs in the US and one in the UK, with substantial input from researchers in Japan. Their aim is to rejuvenate human cells, not with an eye on immortality – as some reports have claimed – but to stave off the diseases of old age that inexorably drive us to the grave. “This is a field whose time has come,” says Prof Dame Linda Partridge at University College London’s Institute of Healthy Ageing. “I think what Altos will do is hugely accelerate the process of finding out whether it is going to deliver or not. We need to see some clinical success stories.” Prof Janet Lord, director of the Institute for Inflammation and Ageing at the University of Birmingham, is enthusiastic, too. “This is not about developing the first 1,000-year-old human; it’s about ensuring old age is enjoyed and not endured. Who wants to extend lifespan if all that means is another 30 years of ill health? This is about increasing healthspan, not lifespan.” It is not the first time Silicon Valley billionaires have thrown their wealth at the ageing problem. In 2013, Google launched Calico – the California Life Company – with its own high-profile hires. With $1bn to burn, the secretive firm began studying mice, which have an average lifespan of six years, and naked mole rats, which, with a lifespan of 30 years, appear to have traded good looks for longevity. The company aims to map the ageing process and extend healthy lifespan, but has yet to produce any products. Not that this has dampened Silicon Valley’s expectations. In a microcosm shaped by big tech, ageing is framed as code to be hacked, with death merely a problem to be solved. Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and the big data analyst Palantir, has poured millions into anti-ageing research, notably the Methuselah Foundation, a non-profit that aims to make “90 the new 50 by 2030”. As powerful computation is brought to bear on biology, Thiel has claimed it will be possible to “reverse all human ailments in the same way that we can fix the bugs of a computer program. Death will eventually be reduced from a mystery to a solvable problem.” There is more to death than old age, of course. From the moment Homo sapiens arose, we have been cut down by acts of violence, accidents, starvation and disease. To solve death would take far more than putting an end to ageing, but the billionaires seem less fired up about solving poverty, war, famine, infant mortality, drug addiction and so on. Partridge finds phrases such as “solving ageing” and “solving death” wrong-headed. “Apart from being silly at the moment, it raises all kinds of societal issues. I think it’s morally dubious. Huge things would percolate through society with a substantial increase in life expectancy brought about by human intervention,” she says. “We’re living longer and longer already. People are suffering from disability and loss of quality of life because of ageing. That’s what we should be trying to fix. We should be trying to keep people healthier for longer before they drop off the perch. Stay healthy then drop dead, die in your sleep. I think that’s what most people want.” Thiel, who hopes to live to 120, is one of the more adventurous advocates of anti-ageing therapies. One that caught his eye – although it is unclear if he has tried it – stems from a series of macabre experiments that found the muscles, brains and organs of old mice were partially rejuvenated when they shared the blood of a young animal. (The younger animals, in return, appeared to age.) Scientists are still trying to establish which blood components are behind the effect, with a view to slowing dementia and other age‑related diseases. But that didn’t stop a number of US firms from offering young blood transfusions for thousands of dollars – until the US Food and Drug Administration intervened, warning consumers that there was “no proven clinical benefit”. Another approach that has pulled in private funders aims to flush worn cells from the body. When cells are damaged – for instance, by toxins or radiation – they can switch into a zombie-like state known as senescence. The process has benefits: senescence can shut down cells with mangled DNA and prevent them from becoming tumours. But senescent cells cause trouble, too: they accumulate in our bodies like junk and release substances that ramp up inflammation. This, in turn, drives diseases of old age. In 2016, a Silicon Valley startup called Unity Biotechnology raised $116m from investors including Thiel and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos to create therapies that flush out senescent cells. Unity’s co-founder, Ned David, believes the drugs could “vaporise a third of human diseases in the developed world”. The evidence so far is encouraging. In 2018, James Kirkland, a researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, showed that “senolytic” drugs that destroy senescent cells not only improved the physical capabilities of aged mice, but also extended their lifespans. More than a dozen clinical trials are under way in humans, targeting osteoarthritis, Alzheimer’s and frailty. In case death turns out to be a hard nut to crack, Thiel and others have hedged their bets and signed up with the Alcor Life Extension Foundation, which has been freezing bodies and brains of the dead since 1976. For about $200,000 and annual dues, the Arizona-based firm (motto: “A fulfilling life doesn’t have to end”) will keep your corpse on ice until science can reanimate you. For those of more modest means, Alcor will freeze your dead head for $80,000. Lord, at the University of Birmingham, describes the procedure as “total nuts”. Altos emerged from stealth mode last month, with the Russian-Israeli tech billionaire Yuri Milner a confirmed backer. Bezos is rumoured to be involved, too. Clearly, they mean business. The chief scientist and co-founder, Rick Klausner, is the former head of the US National Cancer Institute, while the chief executive, Hal Barron, left a role at GlaxoSmithKline that paid more than £8m a year. But what is it with middle-aged male billionaires and anti-ageing research? Has the penny dropped that they, too, will one day fade away? Is rejuvenation science poised to swell their fortunes further? Or – and humour me for a moment here – could this be about the greater good? Asked about the trend after Calico launched, Bill Gates was scathing: “It seems pretty egocentric while we still have malaria and TB for rich people to fund things so they can live longer,” he told an “ask me anything” forum on Reddit. Perhaps the motivation doesn’t matter. Lord says: “We’ve got an ageing population, but we are living longer without living healthier. If you are going to do something with your squillions, it’s as good a target as any.” Prof Lorna Harries, a molecular geneticist at the University of Exeter’s medical school, agrees. “There’s nothing like increasing age to make you aware of your own mortality. I think the urge to extend your life as long as possible is something that’s behind a lot of this,” she says. “But I’m glad they’re putting their money into something that I think will have very tangible benefits down the line. If you are really deadly serious about getting things into the clinic, this is not something we are going to be able to do on academic grants.” Altos’s Cambridge Institute of Science is under construction at Granta Park, a landscaped 120 acres south of the city that is home to AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Illumina, a gene-sequencing firm. The first researchers are due to arrive in May. Two more institutes are being set up in San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area, with further support coming from Prof Shinya Yamanaka, a Nobel prizewinning stem-cell scientist at Kyoto University in Japan. One area Altos will explore is called the integrated stress response (ISR). When cells in the body become stressed by, say, a viral infection, a lack of oxygen, or the buildup of malformed proteins, the ISR can reboot the cell’s protein-making machinery. It is the biological equivalent of the IT department’s “turn it off and on again”. If this doesn’t work, the ISR tells the cell to self-destruct: the biological equivalent of chucking your laptop in the bin. In the past decade, scientists have discovered that the ISR is involved in a host of age-related diseases, including Alzheimer’s. In December 2020, Peter Walter, who will run Altos’s Bay Area institute, showed that drugs can retune the ISR and rapidly restore youthful cognitive powers to aged mice. If nothing else, Altos is good news for over-the-hill rodents. Another area in which Altos hopes to make headway is rejuvenating the immune system. As we age, our immune system weakens, leaving us more prone to cancer and infections. Part of this is driven by changes in the thymus, a gland the size of an oyster that sits between the lungs. The thymus is where the immune system’s protective T cells go to mature, but from puberty onwards it shrinks and is steadily replaced by fat. Steve Horvath, a human-genetics professor who is moving to Altos from the University of California, Los Angeles, found evidence in a small clinical study that a growth hormone, taken with two anti-diabetes drugs, can regenerate the thymus and reverse a person’s biological age. A therapy based on the work might help prevent cancer and make eldery people more resilient to infections. Central to Altos’s vision is a procedure called cellular reprogramming. With every human birth, biology demonstrates its rejuvenative powers by turning the old cells from parents into the youthful tissues of a newborn. In 2006, Yamanaka created a similar effect in the lab. He found that activating four genes in skin cells transformed them into an embryonic state, from which they could grow into the body’s numerous tissues. The work fuelled a wave of interest in growing spare parts for patients, but the procedure has its risks: activate the “Yamamaka factors” inside living animals and they can develop teratomas – tumours made due to a grim confusion of different cell types. Scientists are refining the procedure, winding back the clock just enough to make cells youthful, but not cancerous. In one landmark study, Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a developmental biologist who will lead the Altos institute in San Diego, showed that switching on Yamanaka factors for a six-week burst rejuvenated old mice and extended their lifespan by nearly one-third. “With careful modulation, ageing might be reversed,” he says. The same trick would be hard to pull off in humans. Instead, the hope is to find new biological pathways that, when targeted with drugs, rejuvenate old or senescent cells without causing cancer. Scientists such as Reik and Gill plan to explore these mechanisms in detail, drawing on sophisticated biological clocks to measure how much they turn back time on aged cells. The beauty about targeting ageing itself is that a therapy that helps to prevent one disease might well do the same for others. “If you’ve got the rights to something that works for dementia, a huge public health problem, which you can then turn around and apply to cardiovascular disease, or stroke, or osteoarthritis, that is going to make someone a lot of money,” says Harries, who is also the director and co-founder of Senisca, a biotech spin-off of the University of Exeter that is developing “senotherapeutics” to reverse senescence. There are no guarantees of success, of course, but that is the nature of medical research. “What excites me about Altos is that it’s a new way to do science,” Reik says. “It appeals to me because you can achieve so much more in a bigger team. We want to knuckle down.”",News/Science,If they could turn back time: how tech billionaires are trying to reverse the ageing process,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/17/if-they-could-turn-back-time-how-tech-billionaires-are-trying-to-reverse-the-ageing-process
2/17/2022,"A new attempt will be launched next week to force publication of the full report into whether No 10 parties broke Covid laws, with Conservative MPs urged to support the move to ensure there are “no more cover-ups and no more lies”. While more questionnaires were sent out by Scotland Yard to those who attended a dozen gatherings under investigation, a “humble address” motion was tabled in the House of Commons by the Liberal Democrats.  If passed, ministers would be forced to release a specific set of documents within two days of the Met concluding its investigation. A date has yet to be set for the vote, but could come on the next opposition day allocated to the Lib Dems. It also emerged on Wednesday that the former major Tory donor John Armitage is now funding some staffing costs for the Labour frontbencher Wes Streeting, in an escalation of his opposition to Boris Johnson. Armitage, who revealed last week he had lost confidence in Johnson after giving £3m to the Conservatives, has donated £15,000 to the running of Streeting’s office. He previously donated £12,500 to Labour in March last year and £60,000 to the late former MP Frank Field in 2016 and 2017. He also donated £65,000 to the remain campaign. The papers being demanded include an unredacted version of Sue Gray’s report, all accompanying evidence collected by the Cabinet Office, and a list of Downing Street staff issued with a fixed penalty notice. The move will reignite pressure on the government over the Partygate scandal, which has resulted in calls from some Tory MPs for Boris Johnson to resign. Despite the prime minister having attended some of the events under scrutiny, including a “bring your own booze” garden party organised by one of his most senior former civil service advisers, he has continued to deny any wrongdoing and has avoided a no-confidence vote. There are concerns that some details may never be known, after a leaked Whitehall memo to those investigated by Gray said the Met “will not make public the details of their investigation and therefore your line manager will not be notified”. The Lib Dem’s humble address motion was tabled and backed by all 13 of the party’s MPs. Ed Davey, the party leader, said Johnson “can’t be trusted to admit whether he or any other Conservative ministers end up being fined by the police”, and “we’ve seen time and again that his instinct is to lie, blame others or cover up the truth”. He added: “MPs from across all parties need to come together and force Boris Johnson to come clean. The public deserves to know whether our prime minister has broken the law, and for the full Sue Gray report, including any photos, to be published. “If Johnson is found to have broken the law, he must fess up and resign. No more cover-ups, no more lies.” Labour’s next opposition day is on 23 February, meaning that if the Met investigation has concluded by that point, Keir Starmer could table his own humble address motion to force the publication of documents related to the Gray inquiry. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, has meanwhile written to the Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay and the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, demanding a reassurance that Johnson and his staff have not been receiving any taxpayer-funded legal advice. Downing Street also admitted this week that no minutes were taken at the garden party attended by Johnson on 20 May 2020 that he said he thought had been a “work event”. A freedom of information request that asked for a record of discussions yielded no response, with No 10 pointing to government rules that say minutes do not need to be kept for some events, including those that are “purely informal or of a social nature”. Johnson has refused to say whether he would step down if fined by the police for breaking Covid laws but his spokesperson has suggested Downing Street will reveal if the prime minister does get a fixed penalty notice.",News/Politics,Lib Dems in bid to force publication of full Sue Gray No 10 parties report,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/17/lib-dems-in-bid-to-force-publication-of-full-sue-gray-no-10-parties-report
2/17/2022,"Ever heard of the overview effect? It was coined by a space writer called Frank White to describe how looking down at our little blue planet from above can create a shift in how astronauts think about Earth: all of a sudden you realise how fragile the Earth is and how important it is that we all work together to protect it. “Looking at the Earth from afar you realise it is too small for conflict and just big enough for cooperation,” the astronaut Yuri Gagarin said. Alas, it looks like we needed to replace the overview effect with the avarice effect, because attitudes towards space seem to have shifted. Rather than making people imagine a better world, modern space exploration seems to be all about money, money, money. Elon Musk’s SpaceX has been working with a Canadian startup on plans to launch satellites with billboards on them into space so that adverts can light up the night sky. No doubt some of those ads will be for space tourism: on Wednesday Virgin Galactic opened ticket sales to the public for the first time. And by the “public” I mean that the small sliver of the public that can afford $450,000 for a joyride 300,000 feet above Earth.  The real money, of course, is not in intergalactic billboards or short space trips: it’s in plundering space for resources. Apparently, the race to privatize the moon is on. Of course, many people who are starry-eyed about space mining would balk at the idea that they’re suffering from the avariceeffect: they’d argue that it’s all for the good of mankind. Take, for example, the forward-thinking folk at the Adam Smith Institute (ASI), an influential thinktank that champions free markets. To achieve peace and prosperity on Earth, we need to sell off pieces of space, “with a particular focus on plots of moon land”, the ASI recently declared in a paper. What’s the logic behind this? Well, they reckon that, as long as you’re not too bothered by the fact that global inequality contributes to the death of one person every four seconds, per Oxfam, untrammeled capitalism has done the world a lot of good. “Property rights play a key role in boosting living standards, innovation and human dignity here on Earth,” Daniel Pryor, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute, says. “The same would be true if we applied this logic to space, which presents a unique opportunity to start afresh when designing effective rules of ownership.” This ASI report, titled Space Invaders: Property Rights on the Moon, may seem a little out there but it is very on-brand for the UK-based thinktank. “We propose things which people regard as being on the edge of lunacy,” its president, Dr Madsen Pirie once boasted. “The next thing you know, they’re on the edge of policy.” That’s not hyperbole: the thinktank helped propel a range of privatization efforts in the UK during the 80s and 90s. Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian’s former editor, has described the institute as “a body which has built up a startling track record for floating ideas which end up on the statute books”. In short: don’t dismiss this paper as the ramblings of a bunch of space cadets. That said, don’t expect a McDonald’s on the moon imminently. There are a few obstacles that stand in the way of the ASI’s fantasies of intrepid capitalists plundering the cosmos. Chief among these is the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which is the foundation for international space law. The treaty establishes that space belongs to everyone and no nation has the right to appropriate a celestial body. The Outer Space Treaty was drawn up in the early days of space exploration. It was easy for world leaders to be magnanimous about not monetizing space back then because the idea was still largely theoretical. Now that mining the moon is becoming more of a practical possibility, however, the treaty is swiftly falling out of favour and there have been a series of attempts to undermine it. In 2015, for example, the US Congress and President Barack Obama passed legislation giving American companies the right to own and sell anything they obtain from space. The US argued that this wasn’t a contravention under the Outer Space Treaty (which is not particularly detailed) because there is no claim of sovereignty involved. Donald Trump advanced the commercialization of space further during his time in office. In 2020 he signed an executive order encouraging the commercial development of space. “Outer space is a legally and physically unique domain of human activity, and the United States does not view it as a global commons,” the executive order stated. The steady commercialization of space has not passed the ASI by. “With more countries and companies competing in the space race than ever before it’s vital for us to move past the outdated thinking of the 1960s and tackle the question of extraterrestrial property rights sooner rather than later,’’ the thinktank’s report says. They are absolutely right about that: the Outer Space Treaty is outdated and is already being ignored. We desperately need to establish a framework regarding property rights before billionaires, private corporations and self-interested world leaders start auctioning off the universe. As the outraged online reaction to the ASI’s report demonstrates, not everyone is sold on the idea that giving corporations free rein to mine the moon is going to make the world a better place. It’s already well established that trickle-down economics doesn’t work. Do they really expect us to believe that wealth is going to trickle all the way down from space?",News/Science,‘An opportunity to start afresh’: economists advocate privatising the moon | Arwa Mahdawi,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/17/privatising-moon-economists-advocate
2/17/2022,"The Vietnamese government is routinely placing activists under arbitrary house arrest, employing tactics including stationing guards outside their homes, setting up roadblocks nearby and using superglue and padlocks to jam their doors shut, according to a report.  The study by Human Rights Watch (HRW) documented cases involving 170 rights activists, bloggers, dissidents and their family members who were prevented from domestic and international travel between 2004 and 2021. The real number of those affected is likely to be higher, the report warned.Those targeted had worked on various issues, from land rights and environmental activism, to advocating for media freedom and the rights of political prisoners, to participating in anti-China protests. Detentions are often employed around sensitive political dates and anniversaries, or to prevent individuals from attending protests, court hearings and meetings with diplomats, according to the research. Dissidents are also regularly stopped from travelling abroad, and prevented from returning to the country, it found. It is so common for activists to be subjected to arbitrary house arrest that bloggers have developed a code name for the practice, the report said, calling it banh canh, after a southern dish – banh is a Vietnamese word used for cake or noodles, while canh means either soup or to guard. Activists post on Facebook that they are eating banh canh to signal that they are under house arrest. Some try to bypass restrictions by leaving their homes in advance of dates that might prompt a clampdown, or by taking alternative transport to attend events. Often, they are intercepted. In one prominent case, when then-US president Barack Obama visited Hanoi in 2016, more than half of the civil society representatives he invited to the US embassy were unable to attend. One of the invitees, Nguyen Quang A, an economist and activist, was forced into a car and driven around for hours. Others were blocked from attending or detained en route. Restrictions were also imposed during visits by Presidents Bill Clinton in 2000 and Donald Trump in November 2017 and February 2019 , when he attended the Hanoi summit between Trump and Kim Jong-un, and activists were stopped from meeting UN officials. “The Vietnamese government apparently considers it a crime for some people to attend human rights or freedom of religion events, or meet with visiting foreign dignitaries,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. Such practices had become more common during Covid lockdowns, he added, when the authorities intensified their crackdown on dissidents. During the pandemic, while foreign governments were distracted with health crises at home, the Vietnam authorities also ramped up arrests and imposed longer sentences, said Robertson.“The government realised they could run the table, they could go after all the dissidents, try to lock up as many people as possible, and the international community would not react in a concerted way,” he said. People who are subject to travel bans or detentions are not notified or told how long they will face restrictions. A lack of judicial independence means it is often impossible to challenge the measures in the courts.",News/Global development,"Vietnamese activists routinely placed under house arrest, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/17/vietnamese-activists-routinely-placed-under-house-arrest-report-finds
2/17/2022,"A reporter who infiltrated Éric Zemmour’s presidential election team has claimed he witnessed a culture of casual racism and a covert online campaign involving a “shadow Facebook army” and repeated rewrites of the far-right polemicist’s Wikipedia page, the most viewed in France. Vincent Bresson, 27, says he spent more than three months as an increasingly trusted member of “Génération Z”, as Zemmour’s young supporters’ group is known. He said he witnessed multiple racist remarks from both volunteers and senior staff.  “Officially, if you’re black or of Arab origin, Zemmour believes in ‘assimilation’: work hard, adapt to ‘French culture’, and you can be French ‘like the rest’,” said Bresson, a freelance journalist who has written for publications including Le Monde. “In reality, it seems some Zemmourists will always see you as ‘less French’. And these are supposedly the more moderate, publicly acceptable faces of the campaign. I think it poses serious questions about promises of equal treatment for all under a Zemmour presidency.” Zemmour, a media pundit who promotes the far-right “great replacement” theory that Muslim immigrants are supplanting the populations of European countries, denies he is racist but has two convictions for racist hate speech and is appealing against a third. Less than two months before the first round of voting, he is vying for third place in the polls with the rightwing Les Républicains candidate Valérie Pécresse, behind the far-right National Rally leader, Marine Le Pen, and the incumbent president, Emmanuel Macron. Bresson said in an interview he decided to infiltrate Zemmour’s campaign because “there was at least a chance he could be president”. On his first evening with a group of young activists putting up posters last October, Bresson recounts in his book, Au Coeur de Z (At the Heart of Z), published on Thursday, “one of them used the word ‘negroes’, and nobody batted an eyelid”. On another occasion, a volunteer joked of a black driver delivering campaign leaflets: “If he only knew what he was carrying”. A rare Zemmour supporter of Arab origin was told by another activist he could never sell him his flat, “not with your face”. He says he also witnessed a conversation between two senior team members who referred to black parking attendants at the Villepinte exhibition centre outside Paris, where Zemmour held his first campaign rally last December, as “Mamadou”, a Francophone African first name sometimes used in France to describe a black labourer and recognised as a racist insult. Bresson said he had targeted Génération Z as the easiest way into Zemmour’s campaign because as a “young, white, university-educated man called Vincent – a name in the Christian calendar – and brought up a Catholic, I looked like a plausible recruit”. Zemmour has claimed that if he were elected president he would ban families from giving children non-French first names, meaning people could no longer call their sons Mohammed “but would be allowed to use it as a middle name”. Bresson said he was astonished at how quickly he had been integrated into the group, progressing from late-night or early-morning flyposting expeditions to joining teams of activists trawling social media for potentially serious threats to Zemmour’s safety. He was also promoted to an “elite” list of trusted individuals tasked with sleeping at Zemmour’s campaign headquarters in rue Jean Goujon in the capital’s 8th arrondissement, acting as security guards in exchange for a signed book, photo or lunch with “Z”. “I was astonished at the lack of security,” Bresson said. “I changed my surname and invented a job in PR, but never once was my ID checked. Often, I could have searched Zemmour’s desk, for example – though I never did. I’m a journalist, not a spy.” Bresson also joined Zemmour’s highly sophisticated covert online campaign, run through encrypted Telegram chat groups by the candidate’s director of digital strategy, Samuel Lafont. “This isn’t public at all, it’s covert,” he said. “This is not transparent political campaigning.” The book describes how a “shadow army” of hundreds of Zemmour volunteers are instructed to join a huge array of diverse Facebook groups, ranging from fans of the late French rocker Johnny Hallyday through supporters of Lens or Lyon football clubs to pizza lovers, anti-vaxxers and radical protest movements. “They’re asked to pile in, as many as possible, posting pro-Zemmour content – articles, videos, links to his supporters’ website – and asking what people think of him. Flooding Facebook, commenting and reacting as much and as often as they can, constantly raising their candidate’s profile,” Bresson said. “They can copy-paste material from a central campaign site; they can post exactly the same content across 20 different groups. It’s about creating an impression of huge numbers of people, of a massive online movement.” The book also relates how volunteers are called on for mass campaigns, orchestrated by Lafont, aimed at ensuring pro-Zemmour hashtags – such as #STOPcensure (#STOPcensorship), when the candidate’s Instagram account was briefly suspended last August – trend on Twitter, attracting media coverage. Another unit, known as “WikiZédia”, is charged with editing Wikipedia entries relating to Zemmour, particularly the polemicist’s individual page, which was viewed 5.2m times in 2021, making it the online encyclopaedia’s most consulted page in France. In an online strategy document seen by Bressson, WikiZédia members are expected to make Zemmour “as visible as possible on Wikipedia” by linking to his entry and citing his views on as many subjects as possible, as well as listing his TV appearances. One activist was also engaged in online revisionism in support of Zemmour’s assertion, disproved by historians, that during the second world war France’s collaborationist Vichy régime tried to help French Jews rather than send them to death camps, Bresson writes. The activist, a respected Wikipedia contributor, inserted photos of Vichy’s leader, Philippe Pétain, and prime minister, Pierre Laval, on Zemmour’s Wikipedia page, adding that their “responsibility for the Shoah in France is debated”. Bresson cites a senior French Wikipedia administrator, Jules, as saying WikiZédia’s activities were “unprecedented” for a political party in France and contravene the website’s fundamental principles of objectivity and neutrality. Au Coeur du Z took six months from idea to publication and is published by Éditions Goutte d’Or, whose other undercover reports have also made headlines. Its manuscript was, until late last week, in the hands of one of France’s top media lawyers. One of the book’s publishers, Geoffrey Le Guilcher, said legal action against the book by Zemmour was a possibility but the company was confident there was “absolutely nothing untrue or unverified” in Bresson’s 300-page account. “This is about infiltrating for more transparency,” he said. “Éric Zemmour is the only presidential candidate convicted of racist hate speech. His campaign’s online activity is at the very least amoral. There is a very clear public interest.”",News/World news,French reporter infiltrates campaign of far-right presidential candidate Éric Zemnour,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/french-reporter-infiltrates-campaign-of-far-right-presidential-candidate-eric-zemnour-france
2/17/2022,"Ben Roberts-Smith warned an SAS comrade he would “get a bullet in the back of the head” on the battlefield if he didn’t improve his performance, a witness has told a defamation trial. Roberts-Smith, one of Australia’s most decorated soldiers, carried out a sustained campaign of bullying, threats and undermining of his patrol colleague, the former colleague claimed in his evidence on Thursday.  The soldier, referred to in court as Person One, remains a serving sergeant in the SAS, and a specialist in parachute operations and training. He is giving evidence in the trial of Robert-Smith’s defamation claim against a number of news outlets. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. The court heard Person One had qualified for the SAS, having initially been in the army reserves, and experienced a “negative attitude” from other members of the regiment. “I was from a reserve background, rest of the members were from a regular army background, with significantly more experience than me.” Person One said Roberts-Smith’s “harassment” began before they had deployed to Afghanistan. Person One said Roberts-Smith would hit him in the head while he was driving on the training ground, and told him he was an incompetent soldier, undeserving of a place in the SAS. “He said he was going to do everything in his power to have me removed from the team and to get one of his colleagues to replace me.” Person One told the court he was on patrol with Roberts-Smith in the Chora Valley in May and June of 2006. The patrol marched for 10 hours overnight to the top of a mountain carrying 75-kilogram packs as part of a mission to observe villages below for one or two weeks, looking for any potential insurgent activity. But on the second day, the presence of the patrol was revealed after a young Afghan shepherd was seen walking in the mountains. Person One said the young man – aged between 15 and 20 – had not seen the concealed observation post, but Roberts-Smith and another soldier chased after the man and killed him, drawing attention to the position. Person One said the man was not armed, nor wearing webbing or any other military clothing. The man appeared not to have seen the Australian soldiers, Person One said, because he did not suddenly change his pattern of movement, nor display the “dinner plate eyes” of being shocked to see enemy soldiers nearby. Person One said he believed it was best not to engage the man and give away the Australians’ position. In his evidence before the court last year, Roberts-Smith said the man was a legitimate military target who was moving suspiciously. When he shot the man, Roberts-Smith said a flare – “what you typically get when ordnance goes off or detonates” – came off chest webbing the man was wearing. In court on Thursday, Person One disputed a later-recorded logbook entry which stated the slain man was armed with an assault rifle and “appeared to be aggressively patrolling” and “ready to fire”. Person One told the court the shooting of the Afghan man attracted an insurgent attack and the patrol was engaged in a fierce firefight on the mountaintop that was ended when the Australian patrol called in US aircraft to fire on the insurgent positions. The mission was abandoned. Roberts-Smith was awarded the Medal for Gallantry for his actions during the battle. Under cross-examination, Person One agreed with Bruce McClintock, SC, acting for Roberts-Smith, that the Afghan man killed on the mountain at Chora was likely a Taliban spotter, “a legitimate target”, and that the decision to kill him was reasonable. During that battle, Person One’s machine gun stopped working because he’d failed to bring oil to properly lubricate it. He conceded in court it was a mistake: “I should have taken oil with me on the mission.” Following the Chora Valley mission, Person One told the court Roberts-Smith approached him in the soldiers’ shared team room. Roberts-Smith told him “if your performance doesn’t improve on the next patrol, you’re going to get a bullet in the back of the head”. Person One told the court he understood the threat to mean that Roberts-Smith was going to shoot him in the back of the head in battle. “It made me fearful for my own personal safety,” Person One said. “It made me lose more confidence, it made me perform worse.” Having told comrades of the comment, Person One was encouraged to report it to his commanders, which he did. After the complaint was received, Person One claimed Roberts-Smith threatened him again, approaching him in the mess line, standing close and leaning over him. “If you’re going to make accusations cunt, you’d better have some fucking proof.” Person one said Roberts-Smith would regularly intimidate him and told other soldiers he was “incompetent”, “a coward”, and “didn’t deserve to be in the regiment”. The court spent time examining Person One’s performance reviews, and the weaknesses in his performance as a soldier. While on Roberts-Smith’s patrol he was found to have significant deficiencies. Person One said he lacked confidence in his capabilities as a soldier “due to the behaviour I was being subjected to”. “The applicant [Roberts-Smith] would exaggerate my mistakes and spread rumours about me.” Person One told the court Roberts-Smith’s “harassment got so bad I was struggling with even simple tasks”. He said it cost him “years of lost sleep” and “hamstrung” his career progression. “The death threat I received from him made me fear for my safety. Not only did I have to worry about the Taliban, I had to look over my own back at people in my own squadron.” Person One was moved out of Roberts-Smith’s patrol in July 2006, shortly after Chora. His performance reviews improved considerably after that time. According to performance reviews tendered in court, Person One has since enjoyed a decorated career in the SAS, earning promotions, overseas deployments, and specialist training programs, as well as excellent feedback from superiors, described as a “fine representative of the SASR”. In his earlier evidence before the court, Roberts-Smith denied accusations of bullying. “I’ve never bullied Person One,” he said. He told the court Person One just wasn’t a “very good soldier” who wanted to cover up his poor performance. “It’s always been the case,” he said. “After the battle in Chora I said words to the effect that I didn’t think he should be in the unit and should probably be considering moving back to the regular army.” Roberts-Smith said he never threatened Person One, hit him, or swore at him. The trial, before justice Anthony Besanko, continues.",News/Australia news,"Ben Roberts-Smith warned soldier he would get ‘bullet in the back of the head’, court told",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/17/ben-roberts-smith-warned-soldier-he-would-get-bullet-in-the-back-of-the-head-court-told
2/17/2022,"The way to Bury Castle, in the south-west corner of Bodmin moor, crosses downland with long-horned, hairy cattle. They wander among the coconut-perfumed gorse and hazel coppice, beneath golden catkins blowing sideways in the wind. In the adjoining woods, tree trunks and branches, boulders and uprooted beech are smothered in moss, luminous green against the dull leaf mould. On the hillside, fresh molehills of dark brown earth dot the sheep pastures. A narrow track leads uphill between withered ferns and glossy pennywort, which grow on degraded stone banks overhung with gnarled oak and stunted blackthorn (still there is no hint of swelling flower buds).  Ahead, silhouetted against streaks of bright sky, are the rampart and external ditch of the iron age hill fort (400BC-AD50) set on a ridge extending out from the moor. Today, this ancient turfy enclosure is buffeted by a north-west wind. Braced against the gusts, we peer north towards the distinctive high tors of Brown Willy and Rough Tor, and eastward towards the grey outlines of Caradon Hill and Sharp Tor, which rise above home in the Tamar Valley. In Cardinham, to the south-west, 400 feet below this fortified lookout, the pinnacled tower of St Meubred’s church is set among hazy sunbeams that seem to draw water from the surrounding fields, and steep wooded valleys running towards the River Fowey. Across the parish there are medieval granite crosses, including Treslea, which marks the boundary of glebe land (owned by the church), and an early memorial cross, finely sculpted and dating from the ninth or 10th century. It was found in 1872, built into the external wall of the chancel. Downhill from the church, past the community tennis court and war memorial cemetery, jays screech across a soggy path into the gloomy woods that hide the bailey and reduced motte of Cardinham Castle, constructed by the Fitz Turolds, owners of 28 manors at the time of Domesday. Back in Cardinham village, around old tombstones in the graveyard, and in the gardens and hedges, drifts of snowdrops gleam in the fading light – substitutes for this winter’s absence of real snow.
