3/9/2022,"Climate scientists have issued a warning on the dangers of heat stress for animals and farm workers. Increasing levels of exposure will be harmful for animal health and reduce meat and dairy production in many parts of the world, according to the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of the world’s leading climate scientists.The world’s first octopus farm looks set to open in the Canary Islands as government officials carry out an environmental assessment on plans for a facility starting in 2023. Animal rights activists have protested against the plans, with octopuses known to be intelligent and inquisitive as seen in the Netflix film My Octopus Teacher.One egg a day for everyone on the planet is the aim of an initiative to double global egg consumption over the next decade. Mexico and Japan lead the way at present with a per capita consumption of more than 300 eggs a year. Almost all of Japan’s egg producers use battery cages as it continues to resist international pressure to improve welfare conditions for chickens. Europe’s largest egg producer, France, has banned the slaughter of male chicks. The industry has until the end of 2022 to comply. Farmers will be required to look at alternative methods to ensure male chicks are not born, including the use of technology that enables the sex of the embryo to be identified before they develop into chicks and hatch. France is also trialling avian influenza vaccines as countries across Europe battle one of the worst winters for the disease on the continent. Any vaccine is complicated by the numerous strains of bird flu and the bans some countries have on importing poultry meat from countries that vaccinate birds. An outbreak of a deadly pig disease African swine fever was covered up by officials in Thailand, it has been claimed. The government denies the accusation and said most pig deaths were from another deadly disease, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. Meanwhile, the World Bank is funding a project to scale-up intensive pig farming in Vietnam.A provision to ban commercial mink farms in the US has been added to a bill making its way through Congress. Most countries in the EU have now banned fur farming, with the UK the first country to do so in 2000. China is on its way to becoming the world’s biggest producer. Farmed fish should have the same legal protection as other farmed animals, say animal welfare activists. The Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation, which has the prime minister’s wife Carrie Johnson as a patron, says fish deserve to be treated with the same care as cows, pigs, sheep and other livestock because they experience stress and pain.Herefordshire county council is asking residents if their health and wellbeing has been affected by intensive chicken farms. Of the 1.1 billion broiler chickens slaughtered each year in Britain, about 25% are raised in Herefordshire and Shropshire. A surge in poultry farms means there are 70 times more chickens than people in the two counties. Vets have described undercover footage showing cows from a Welsh dairy farm being kicked, hit with shovels and mistreated as “abuse” and “totally unnecessary”. The farm was stripped of its membership of the red tractor assurance scheme, which admitted that some welfare breaches are not always detectable during its inspections.The UK may no longer move ahead with a ban on the import and sale of fur and foie gras, according to reports. The ban had been proposed in the Conservative’s 2019 manifesto. British farmers have been banned from making foie gras – created by force-feeding ducks or geese – since 2000.The use of critically important antibiotics on UK dairy farms fell by 98% between 2018 and 2021, according to an industry study. The vast majority of farm antibiotics in the UK are used in the pig and poultry sectors, both of which have reported significant reductions in recent years. Satellite data shows more than 400 sq miles (1,000 sq km) of Amazon rainforest has been cleared for cattle and maize on farms growing soya, undermining claims crop is deforestation-free.US president Joe Biden’s pledge during Cop26 to reduce methane emissions by almost one-third has not, apparently, resulted in any limits on one of the country’s biggest emitters: the beef sector. Industry figures admitted they had escaped “relatively unscathed”, but observers warned the US would never meet Biden’s 2030 climate reduction goals without regulation.There have been renewed calls in the US to ban “cruel” on-farm killing methods as the country braces itself for an increase in bird flu outbreaks. Using firefighting foam to suffocate animals and ventilation shutdown, in which animals are killed with extremely high heat and steam, are still permitted in the US, despite being labelled “inhumane”.And finally, in this beautiful photo essay, renowned photographer Bruno Zanzottera and anthropologist Elena Dak spent a year following a shepherding family and their flock across mountainous pastures in the Dolomites, Italy.

However, the evidence suggests that without livestock, our soils will continue to deteriorate. We must be careful not to ban the good ways, just because we want to eliminate the bad ways.

3/9/2022,"We’re sanctioning Russian oligarchs up the wazoo, hoping it’s a way to get Putin to stop his deadly attack on Ukraine. But for this tactic to work, two conditions must be met: first, the US and our allies must be able to locate and tie up Russian oligarchic wealth. Second, Russian oligarchs must have enough power to stop Putin. Let’s take them one at a time: Anecdotally, sanctions on the oligarchs appear to be working. Last Sunday, the billionaire industrialist Oleg Deripaska (on the US sanctions list) and banker Mikhail Fridman (on the EU’s) both publicly urged an end to Putin’s war. Billionaire businessman Roman Abramovich has put his English soccer club up for sale and vowed to donate the proceeds to “all victims of the war in Ukraine”. Banker and entrepreneur Oleg Tinkov told his 634,000 Instagram followers last week that “innocent people are dying in Ukraine now, every day, this is unthinkable and unacceptable”. But are these sanctions really biting? This is where a comparison of Russian oligarchs with American oligarchs comes in. While Russian oligarchs (Russia’s richest 0.01%) have hidden an estimated $200bn offshore (over half of their financial wealth), American oligarchs – America’s 765 billionaires – have hidden $1.2tn (about 4% of their wealth), mostly to avoid paying taxes on it. While American oligarchs park their income and wealth in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands, Russian oligarchs have hidden their most valuable assets in the United States and the European Union. The reason they do so is telling: western democracies follow the rule of law. Under the rule of law, before a government can seize property it must follow lengthy and elaborate legal processes. As a result, American and European governments are finding their hands tied in actually taking control of the assets of Russian oligarchs. American law makes it difficult even to discover what Russian oligarchs own in the US because they’ve hidden their assets behind complex trusts and shell corporations. American laws governing taxes, corporations, transportation and banking are wonderfully convenient for the world’s oligarchs. One out of every six aircraft in the United States, for example, is registered through trusts, Delaware corporations and even post office box addresses, making it almost impossible to discover their true owners. This isn’t an argument against sanctioning Russian oligarchs. It’s just that we need to be clear-eyed about how difficult it is to do so. American oligarchs have enormous political clout. In the 2012 presidential election (the most recent for which we have detailed data on individual contributions), the richest 0.01% of Americans – the richest 1% of the richest 1% – accounted for 40% of all campaign contributions. What have American oligarchs got out of these campaign contributions? The lowest tax rates on the highest incomes in over a generation – and the lowest among all wealthy nations. They’ve also gotten an IRS so starved of resources it’s barely able to enforce the law. Russian oligarchs who have pledged loyalty to Putin arguably have less political power in Russia than do American oligarchs in the US. In Putin’s Russia, power is exercised by a narrow circle of officials and generals appointed by Putin, whom he has drawn largely from the former KGB. According to several Russian specialists I’ve spoken with over the last few days, this circle has become very small in recent months, now numbering perhaps a half dozen. We should use whatever means are at our disposal to make Vladimir Putin end the brutal war he started. But it is proving difficult to use sanctions on specific oligarchs to get Putin to stop. Perhaps we should be more ambitious. My Berkeley colleague Gabriel Zucman recommends that the US and the European Union freeze all offshore holdings of Russian nationals in excess of $10m. This would affect about 10,000 to 20,000 Russians who have benefited the most from Putin’s rule. Meanwhile, blanket sanctions against the Russian economy are having an effect. Over the past week they have caused the rouble to collapse and decimated Russian markets. But the burden has fallen mostly on ordinary Russians, many of whom have already suffered from Putin’s brutal regime. As we’ve seen in North Korea and Iran, dictatorships don’t depend on popular approval. In fact, widespread hardship can lead to even more repression and violence. We should remind ourselves that Putin is not synonymous with the Russian people.

3/9/2022,"Where do we draw the line between a white lie, an infidelity and a Trumpian fantasy? When does being economical with the truth become a betrayal? Can we keep a secret without it corroding our sense of self and poisoning our relationships? These are the questions writer-director Zinnie Harris threads through The Scent of Roses, a restless, squirming quest for the truth – or if not that, then at least a conversation about the truth. Sometimes funny, frequently disorientating, it is a bold drama that worries away at its theme to create a compelling study of evasion and responsibility. If we can’t be honest with ourselves, let alone each other, Harris seems to say, can we ever escape the lies? And if we cannot be straight about the smallest things, what hope do we have of resolving dilemmas on a global scale? With an adventurous structure worthy of a Caryl Churchill play and staccato exchanges recalling Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, it begins in a middle-class Edinburgh bedroom where a couple are winding down after a tough day. It could be the setting of a cosy sitcom if only Neve McIntosh’s Luci were not so scary in her resolve. She has decided it is time for honesty from her husband, Christopher, played by Peter Forbes as a man-child enjoying a life of happy unaccountability, quite unprepared for his wife’s scrutiny. Yet Luci, too, has her own secrets. As Tom Piper’s interior set expands and fractures, so the play pulls apart the fault lines between discretion and dishonesty. The mood shifts to heightened realism as their daughter Caitlin enters with a bloodied bird, Leah Byrne revelling in her role as unreliable narrator as she confronts Saskia Ashdown’s depressive Sally, her former teacher who is burdened by repressed guilt. Only Maureen Beattie’s Helen, whose connection with the others is revealed late in the play, shows a breezy acceptance of the past, yet even she is shaped by deceits old and new. There are shades of Ibsen in this confrontation with the lies of the past, but Harris has no neat Victorian resolution. Instead, she questions and teases in a knotty, unending search for openness.

3/9/2022,"One of the most important studies in the pandemic – studying the potential impact of Covid on the brain – was just published. The major findings of loss of gray matter, reduced brain size, and cognitive decline are concerning and need to be placed in context. If you want to determine whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus can damage the brain, you would ideally have a MRI brain scan before and after the Covid infection and a matched (for age and sex, medical history) control group of people without infection who also had two sets of brain images. It just so happened that in the United Kingdom over tens of thousands of people enrolled in their UK Biobank had undergone a brain scan before the pandemic and a subset of these were brought back at an average three years later, with or without having had Covid. They also had basic cognitive testing – a connect-the-dots type of test – with their brain scans. There were about 400 participants in each group, aged between 47 and 80, on average 59, at the time of their baseline scan. There was lack of diversity with 97% of both groups of white ethnicity. All but 15 people in the Covid group had mild to moderate Covid, not requiring hospitalization, and the results were not affected by deleting this small number people requiring hospitalization from the analysis. Importantly, in context, the study pertains to older white adults with mostly mild Covid. As we age, there is typically a loss of gray matter of about 0.2% each year, which was seen in the control group. In contrast, the people with Covid in this study, at four months after their infection, had more gray matter loss than the control group, some up to tenfold more. Notably, the damage to the brain – the loss of gray matter – was chiefly in regions related to smell. Beyond the structural changes of the brain, there was a decline in the cognitive test among the infected group, taking longer to do the task. Separately, there was no difference in memory testing results between the two groups. Now, what does all this mean? It’s a unique study design that is hard to replicate, but independent replication is important. We don’t have that yet, so we can’t consider the findings definitive, even though they are indeed concerning. Further uncertainties include the lack of knowledge about symptoms in the Covid group, such as loss of smell, and reliance for classification (Covid v no Covid) on different Covid tests, some of which do not have high accuracy. Were the two groups balanced? It was noted there was “a subtle pattern of lower cognitive abilities in the participants who went on to be infected”. While this would not influence the results of serial testing, or comparison with controls, it bespeaks some imbalances in features between the Covid and control groups. Even though it is the largest Covid brain imaging study, its size does not pre-empt multiple small differences between the groups, that cumulatively may have influenced the findings. The mechanism for the structural brain changes is uncertain, but probably involves inflammation that originated from the nasal infection. Most studies of Covid and the brain support virus-induced inflammation, rather than direct infection of neurons, as the path to brain damage. The regions of the brain most affected in the Covid group are related to sense of smell, the limbic system, incriminating this nasal entry port. Whether the process is specific to this virus was examined in the current study by comparing Covid brain images with a small number of people with either influenza or pneumonia, and not seeing a similarity in pattern. It is important to note that this was not a study of long Covid. The symptom of brain fog that is commonly reported in people suffering from long Covid and has been likened to cancer therapy “chemo brain” with brain inflammation chiefly involving white matter, is not related to the current report. The Covid group was assessed only one time after infection, about four months later, memory was not impaired, and details of symptoms were absent. The single assessment also raises the question as to whether the structural changes, and more likely the cognitive decline, may have some reversibility. While brain cells do not have high capability to regenerate, they have remarkable plasticity to form and reorganize synaptic connections – for preserving function. The flip side is also a possibility. Limbic system atrophy, the modest degree of which was seen in the Covid group, is one of the classic patterns of brain imaging of Alzheimer’s disease. For these reasons, subsequent brain imaging to determine potential recovery or progression, is essential. Another question relates to whether the findings apply to younger adults and children. In the present study the rudimentary evidence of cognitive decline occurred mainly in people older than 70. Whether Covid may affect structural or functional brain changes in young people is yet to be established. That also brings up the cause-and-effect issue, since the evidence of brain impact must be considered as an association, since proof of Covid causality, although likely, is not absolute or certain. In context, the study pertained to variants antedating Omicron, the ultra-transmissible strain that is thought to have potentially infected 40% or more of Americans and Europeans in recent months. It is important to note that loss of smell was considerably less with Omicron than Delta and prior variants, in some studies one-tenth as likely. This suggests that the liability for brain effects of Covid would be far less likely with Omicron. Each variant can have different affinity, known as tropism, to tissues and organs within the body; for reasons yet unexplained Omicron has less tropism to the olfactory bulb, the neurons at the base of the brain specialized in smell. In two years, we’ve come a long way from considering severe Covid pneumonia as being the singular concern. While the list of uncertainties about Covid’s deleterious impact on the brain is long and unsettled, it is vital that we maintain a high regard for the potential liability and unpredictability of even mild infections.

3/9/2022,"Two months after Elizabeth Holmes was found guilty of defrauding Theranos investors, her former business and romantic partner, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, is set to begin his own trial on Wednesday. The trial of Balwani, who served as the blood testing startup’s co-president, shares several parallels with Holmes’s. The businessman is accused of similar crimes, including wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud investors, and will appear in the same San Jose, California, courthouse where Holmes spent more than 12 weeks defending herself. Jury selection begins on Wednesday, with opening arguments expected to start on Wednesday of next week. Balwani’s case marks the latest chapter in a cautionary tale that has inspired films, podcasts and a television show, and prompted a reckoning with the Silicon Valley hype machine. Both trials centered on the spectacular rise and fall of Theranos, the company Holmes founded after dropping out of Stanford at 19 years old that promised a revolutionary blood testing technology, attracting millions of dollars in investments. But in 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company fell short of this ambitious pledge, revealing that its tests were largely inaccurate and that it was running most labs on third-party machines with traditional blood drawing techniques. A jury convicted Holmes in early January of four counts related to wire fraud against investors, and remains free on bond pending her sentencing hearing on 26 September 2022, after Balwani’s trial concludes. Balwani, 56, is being charged separately for his own role in Theranos, where he served in varying capacities including co-president and a member of the board from 2009 to 2016. He has pleaded not guilty. While guilty verdict in the Holmes trial does not have any direct legal bearing on Balwani’s charges, experts say having a second opportunity to argue a Theranos case could give the prosecution an advantage. “It does permit prosecutors to better understand what worked in that trial and what didn’t,” said Michael Weinstein, a former Department of Justice trial attorney and current white collar defense attorney at law firm Cole Schotz. Balwani rose as a prominent figure during Holmes’s own fraud trial, where the founder testified extensively about their relationship. The pair met when he was 37 and she was an 18-year-old high school student. In her own trial she accused him of controlling behavior, which she argued ultimately led to her business decisions that resulted in the fraud charges. Prosecutors, however, sought to prove Holmes acted alone and had the final say in Theranos’s missteps. “She chose to be dishonest with investors and patients,” prosecutor Jeff Schenk said in his closing arguments. “That choice was not only callous, it was criminal.” The domestic violence defense was ultimately less prominent than initially anticipated, Weinstein said, raising the question of whether Balwani’s legal team will address the abuse allegations in court. He has previously denied the accusations. Balwani’s trial is almost certain to generate less spectacle than Holmes’s, which was marked by fervent media coverage and long lines of observers waiting for a coveted courtroom seat. But his case could still have wide-ranging impacts on Silicon Valley and investing-related regulations, said Weinstein, as federal prosecutors seek to prove the Holmes verdict was not a fluke. “It’s the legal equivalent of the famous Bat signal shining brightly into the sky but here, it’s the prosecution shining a light into Silicon Valley puffery, misleading public facing statements and false investor disclosures,” he said. “When and if those occur, government wants Silicon Valley to know there is a new sheriff in town in determining whether startups actions cross the line between enthusiasm or intentional fraud,” Weinstein added.",News/Technology,Sunny Balwani trial to start two months after Elizabeth Holmes’s guilty verdict,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/09/theranos-sunny-balwani-trial-begins-elizabeth-holmes
3/9/2022,"Texas’s highly restrictive abortion law has forced thousands of women to cross state lines to seek the procedure, according to new research by the University of Texas. Since the passing of the law, known as Senate Bill 8 (SB8) last year banning almost all abortions in the state, an average of 1,400 Texas women traveled each month between September and December 2021 and sought abortion services at 34 facilities in nearby states. The average is approximately the same as the total number of Texans who traveled out of state each year to those clinics for all reasons between 2017 and 2019. In August 2021, only 235 Texans went for abortions in the 34 facilities, the month before SB8 took effect. The states that many Texas residents sought abortions from include Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Nearly three out of four Texans, or 45%, who traveled out of state during those months seeking the procedure obtained abortion care in Oklahoma, which just has four facilities that offer abortion services. According to the research, the number of Texans seen each month at these clinics since the law took effect is more than double the monthly average of all abortion patients seen in Oklahoma in 2020. Around one in four Texans seeking an abortion, or 27%, traveled to New Mexico to obtain such a service. The state has seven facilities. New Mexico does not require state-mandated counseling, waiting periods or parental consent for minors. From October 2021 to February 2022, researchers interviewed 65 Texas women who sought abortion services across state lines. The participants ranged from 18 to 42 years old. Nearly half, or 46%, identified as Hispanic/Latinx, 23% as Black, 21% as white, 6% as Asian and 2% as more than one race. Participants reported a median gestational duration at abortion of nine weeks. Texas bans abortion after about six weeks. The participants described their frequent experiences with delays, often as a result of state law that include mandatory ultrasounds and counseling visits. Some participants said they visited “pregnancy resource centers” – organizations that frequently offer ultrasounds free of charge but may seek to discourage pregnant people from seeking abortion. Participants who had medical conditions that posed health risks for continuing their pregnancy said their healthcare providers were reluctant to offer information on out-of-state options for abortion services. The law, which disproportionately affects communities of color, adds a burden in the need to travel, as not all may have the necessary resources to travel beyond state lines. Due to long wait times at nearby abortion services in neighboring states, many participants said they were unable to get an appointment at those facilities and had to travel even farther to obtain abortion care. From Fort Worth, Texas, for example, the nearest Oklahoma facility is nearly 200 miles, or over three hours’ drive away. From Houston, the facility is 450 miles, or seven and a half hours away. To obtain an abortion in Oklahoma, people first must receive state-mandated counseling and then wait at least 72 hours, imposing a further cost and time burden that is beyond many would-be patients. Additionally, unlike in New Mexico, minors are also required to notify a parent and obtain parental consent before receiving abortion care. In June, the conservative-majority supreme court is expected to deliver a decision on Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the most significant abortion rights case since the landmark 1973 supreme court ruling in Roe v Wade, which effectively legalized abortion in the US. The case pits Mississippi’s last abortion clinic against the state’s leadership, as the latter seeks to ban abortion after 15 weeks gestation and asks the highest court to overturn Roe. “I’ve never felt more like the government doesn’t give a shit about me than I do right now, to be honest with you. I’ve never felt it so deep inside of me that I am so disposable, that I don’t matter, that I don’t get any bodily autonomy in such a horrible [life-threatening] situation … I just wish that I could have [had] done it here, at home,” said one Texas woman to the researchers of her experience in obtaining an out-of-state abortion. “I really feel like this whole Texas law – I don’t agree with it. It’s not right, and it’s so hard. I can just imagine the women who don’t have the support system that I have, how hard it is for them to get an abortion if they’re able to … If I didn’t have my support system, it would have been so hard, if not impossible, to get this done,” another said.",News/US news,Texas abortion ban forcing thousands to cross state lines for procedure – study,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/09/texas-abortion-ban-cross-state-lines-study
3/9/2022,"Can you die of not writing a novel, asks Howard Jacobson towards the end of this memoir of his tortured journey towards doing precisely that. The question is posed partly by his present self, who has turned out 16 of them and a clutch of nonfiction books besides, and partly by the grotesquely frustrated, shamefully underachieving, semi-employed polytechnic lecturer who somehow couldn’t kickstart himself into doing the thing – perhaps the only thing – he felt was worth doing. He was 40 before his first novel, Coming from Behind, was published, and it had taken a weird, alchemical alignment of circumstances and catalysts to get there, culminating in a disastrous honeymoon that made way for inspiration, “beckoning derisively, not with the elegantly shaped arms of the classical muses, reaching out through gold-edged clouds, but with the gnarled, crooked fingers – as though from some disreputable alley – of low, self-disgusted mirth”. You will gather already that this is not a book filled with writerly confidences of the sort that might even be taken as exemplary or advisory. It is not concerned with the business of going calmly to your desk each morning and getting something down; of treating the enterprise as a job like any other, and of keeping a sense of proportion. The reverse, in fact. This is a book wildly lacking in proportion: melodramatic, simultaneously self-aggrandising and self-abasing, filled with fear, shame, anger, failure and the occasional triumph. There are many references to weeping. If you like that sort of thing – and, if you like Jacobson’s novels, you presumably do – it is utterly captivating. If you don’t, read something else, because it will enrage you. The high emotionalism that fuels Mother’s Boy extends far beyond writing, although Jacobson might argue that everything comes back to writing, in one sense or another. Certainly, his account of growing up in the Manchester suburbs of Cheetham Hill, Hightown and Prestwich – “Bialystok on Irwell”, as he thinks of his great-grandparents’ neighbourhood – is bursting with stories, many of which have already made their way into his work, both as fiction and documentary. Once Jacobson has thrown off the hated shackles of infancy – he was, he maintains, a “failed baby”, and wishes only that there had been a Hamlet babygrow for him to mooch sullenly around in – he is reading books with his mother, a “conscientious educator” who introduces him to the desolate sorrows of Tennyson and Matthew Arnold, the desperate escapism of Somerset Maugham’s The Moon and Sixpence and a Romanian folk-tale in which a son cuts his mother’s heart out in order to satisfy his jealous lover. His father, meanwhile, represents a different way of living; less rooted in the mind, and more in the baffling variousness of the material world. Omnicompetent, Max Jacobson is an upholsterer, a driver, regimental tailor, taxi driver, magician and market trader; some of the funniest reminiscences are of his attempts to rope his reluctant and ill-equipped son into helping him charm customers, from Worksop to Oswestry. His temperament is at odds with his son, whom he dubs “a kunilemelly”, an insult derived from a Yiddish operetta that Jacobson translates as “a hypersensitive, easily wounded, forever embarrassed, ungrateful and unmanly boy. Me.” The son, understandably, bridles at the term; the memoirist gives us ample examples of its truth. At his barmitzvah, his speech invokes his overflowing cup of happiness: “Everyone knows it’s a lie. Everyone knows I’ve never had a cup of happiness with anything in it let alone one that overflows.” But as much as Jacobson points to his mother – hence the book’s title – as the formative influence on his life as a reader and consequently as a writer, there is something about his father’s love of conjuring that must have played its part. As a novelist, Jacobson often shrouds his characters, and the desires and griefs that torment and infuriate them, and which they both repudiate and brandish, in mystery; his sentences and paragraphs are often suggestive rather than straightforward, elliptical rather than direct. They tend to resolve with a final flourish that often leaves the reader mystified – somewhat, of course, like a magician’s trick. In pursuit of his vocation, Jacobson finds himself grimacing his way through Cambridge, where his near-worship of FR Leavis doesn’t dispel his feeling of social exclusion; to Australia, twice, in various states of happiness and despair; through two marriages; to Cornwall and to Wolverhampton. In the West Midlands, he appears to be putting himself through a particularly grim form of exile, living in a cold-water flat with a dismal shared bathroom that is only partly explained by his lack of funds; indeed, he theorises that he was creating a cell in which to expiate his sins. Everywhere, he is dogged by shame, which he ascribes partly to his Jewishness – or at least, his grappling with what it signifies to him – and partly to the idea of “something wanting”, akin to that experienced by David Copperfield and Great Expectations’s Pip. Perhaps it’s easy enough to write about how difficult it was to write when you’ve won the Booker prize – and certainly, Jacobson never pretends that he isn’t delighted that things came good. But behind the comical grandiosity of Mother’s Boy, there is a sense of something much graver and more sombre, to do with the lifelong struggle – not limited to writers of novels – to integrate the lives and subjectivities of one’s parents, and their parents, with one’s own desires; to reconcile their expectations with yours, and with what the world will allow. As a child, Max Jacobson grew up believing that Passover was a celebration of his birthday, the Seder dinner his party; the coincidence of his birthdate was a boon for his cash-strapped parents, who could roll two ceremonies into one. One year, his mother forgot the fiction, and sent him to the neighbours to borrow something she’d forgotten, whereupon the trick was exposed by their similarly arranged table. “I find this so sad a tale to tell I can barely tell it,” his son tells us. And therein lies the rub: tales too sad to tell are also those that are too sad not to, which is why someone has to write them down.  Mother’s Boy is published by Vintage (£18.99).

In Bristol, a new store goes further, providing an outfit for the purpose that includes a coat with extra inside pockets and a scarf with pouches for penny sweets.

And if you weren’t going to spend money, that thing would probably give you Covid and you’d die.” Clerke has been collecting swimming pool inflatables as a backdrop to talks about – yes – inflation, while the “Debt Gala”, a take on the annual celeb jamboree the Met Gala, will include cocktails such as the “debtropolitan” as well as debt-themed karaoke and prizes for the best borrowed outfit. In the daily lunchtime “doughnut hour”, participants will be invited to eat doughnuts while discussing doughnut economics, a visual framework for a healthy society developed by an Oxford economist. At “Shoplift-o’Clock!” shoplifters will be let loose to fill their pockets while evading shopkeepers. Clerke wondered how shoppers might behave if invited to steal stuff. As well as sweets, potential loot will include more inflatables, scratchcards and other products that people are expected to bring to trade and swap. “What if we saw shoplifting as a kind of radical form of commoning?” the artist adds, referring to the socialist tradition of sharing and collaboration (her approach calls to mind the 17th-century protest poem against the enclosure of common land: “The law locks up the man or woman, Who steals the goose from off the common, But leaves the greater villain loose, Who steals the common from off the goose.”) Clerke, whose large wire-rimmed specs are about the same size as her hoop earrings, admits she has more questions than answers. She is not an economist, nor any kind of expert (and nor, to be clear, is she promoting criminal behaviour). But from an early age she has been fascinated by how things work – and how they might work differently. “I’ve always been a pain in the arse,” she says. “As a kid I’d take something really boring and be, like, ‘Mum, how do you make this digestive biscuit?’ A couple of years ago I realised that’s all I’m doing as an artist – trying to work out how things are made.” Among other conceptual artists, she has found inspiration in Piero Manzoni, an Italian avant garde pioneer best known for canning his own faeces in his 1961 work “Merda d’Artista”, or Artist’s Shit. He valued the tins at $37 according to their equivalent weight in gold. In 2016, one of the tins sold at auction for a new record of €275,000. Transactionland is the third project in a 10-year series Clerke calls Businesses – an “irreverent yet earnest attempt to understand, expose and co-opt systems of money, trade and exchange”. In 2019, she launched a subscription business. For £4 a month, 50 subscribers received objects in the post, including a printed pamphlet containing all the emails between Clerke and her estate agent, and the materials necessary for building a fire. The artist explored shared ownership in her second business, selling 461 shares in a 6ft 3in cardboard cutout of herself for £5 each – with a view to retaining a majority 51% shareholding. She is using the income to build a bicycle that all shareholders will be entitled to use. Clerke says she is anxious to engage people in themes of money. “We don’t like talking about money or economics and if I’m being cynical, which I am, I think that is by design – it suits the banks and the government that we almost don’t feel we have a right to understand.” As well as the government’s response to Covid – to promote spending in shops and restaurants – Clerke is struck by the widening economic inequality that the pandemic is contributing to, including the effects of inflation on food. “A lot of people are very vulnerable and struggling and as an artist I’m not going to fix everything,” she admits. “It’s about making a space for a bit of uncertainty and for asking questions.” Transactionland is at St Anne’s House, Bristol, until 20 March.",Arts/Art and design,Feeling the pinch?

3/9/2022,"The UK’s position on fracking “has not changed”, and shale gas wells will be closed with concrete by the 30 June deadline despite pressure from the rightwing press and backbench Conservatives, according to a government spokesperson. On Tuesday, Steve Baker, the MP for High Wycombe and trustee of the controversial climate sceptic thinktank Global Warming Policy Foundation, hosted the shale gas lobby along with MPs and journalists in the Houses of Parliament. The event took place as the government committed to phasing out Russian oil and gas by the end of the year, and reports in rightwing media suggested that fracking could be revived in the UK. Not only is fracking potentially polluting, disruptive and dangerous to communities, many experts say it would take up to a decade to reap any benefits, and the amount of gas would not make a dent in the global price. Where fracking has been trialled, there has been major local opposition and anger due to earthquakes caused. But the UK Onshore Oil and Gas lobby group described opposition to fracking as “illogical”, and Baker said: “As preparations are made for cement trucks to fill in the UK’s last functioning shale gas wells, it is obscene that Russia’s war crimes are being funded by Europe’s addiction to their gas.“Under the government’s plans, we will need vast quantities of gas even as renewables are ramped up. It is time for all of us to listen to facts, not scare stories. The shale gas industry needs a level playing field and an end to hysterical misinformation.” Reports in the Daily Mail and Telegraph suggested that Boris Johnson may be looking again at fracking despite the pollution it can cause. A source at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy told the Guardian: “The deadline to decommission wells is 30 June, it has always been that. The government’s position on fracking hasn’t changed.” The source said that despite pressure from the rightwing press, fracking is still not something being considered by government. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has been strident in his opposition to fracking, and recently said it is not the answer. He tweeted: “The wholesale price of gas has quadrupled in UK and Europe. Additional UK production won’t materially affect the wholesale market price. This includes fracking – UK producers won’t sell shale gas to UK consumers below the market price. They’re not charities.” Even MPs in Baker’s Net Zero Scrutiny Group have reservations about fracking in their constituencies. The Blackpool MP Scott Benton, who has previously mocked climate summit Cop26, has said he would be reticent to allow fracking in his constituency due to the earthquakes it has caused in the past. But there has been pressure on Johnson to abandon his net zero goals. Nigel Farage announced his ambition for a referendum on the issue in a piece for the Mail on Sunday at the weekend. The CBI said businesses were behind net zero, despite Farage calling his campaign “Britain Means Business”. Tom Thackray, the CBI’s decarbonisation director, said: “Businesses across the economy are fully committed to meeting the UK’s net zero target, backed by their customers and investors. Not only will their actions to decarbonise help avert the risks of higher global temperatures, it is also an opportunity to transform our economy based on higher productivity jobs and green technologies.” Polling shows that the UK public is strongly behind the move to a low-carbon economy, and businesses and senior political figures have rallied to the need for the UK to move away from fossil fuels, which Vladimir Putin has been wielding as a “political and economic weapon”, according to the chief of the International Energy Agency. Joe Twyman, co-founder of the public opinion consultancy Deltapoll, pointed out that support for net zero is consistently high. Nearly two thirds of people (63%) supported the target in November, the latest poll by the company, while fewer than one in 12 (8%) disapproved. But Twyman added that people tend to support the idea of holding referendums in general. “The only exception to that I can find is one I came up with in May 2013. The British public were divided 32% in favour and 44% against a referendum on Britain’s membership of the Eurovision Song Contest.” Senior Conservatives close to the prime minister said elements within the Tory party were lobbying for a change of stance, but unsuccessfully. One of them, the donor and investor Ben Goldsmith, said: “I don’t see [a change of mind from the prime minister] at all. I think the government recognises the public’s insistence on restoring the terribly depleted natural fabric of our country, and on tackling the growing climate crisis with the urgency it deserves.” Sam Hall, of the Conservative Environment Network, which numbers nearly half of backbench Conservative MPs, said support for net zero was hardening under Putin’s weaponising of Europe’s dependency on Russian gas. “In my experience, the vast majority of Conservative MPs recognise the importance of helping Europe move away from Russian gas and expanding homegrown clean energy. The Ukraine crisis has made reducing gas consumption and achieving net zero more urgent.”",News/Environment,UK’s fracking position ‘has not changed’ despite move to phase out Russian oil,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/09/uk-fracking-position-not-changed-phase-out-russian-oil
3/9/2022,"Almost two years after Covid triggered a puppy boom, Crufts is expecting a host of newcomers as new dog owners who honed their skills during lockdown take to the ring this week. “There are new people, who got a dog during lockdown, who have started to show their dogs. Some have qualified for Crufts for the first time ever, which is obviously really exciting,” said Bill Lambert, the head of health and welfare at Crufts. “Any sport, any activity, needs new blood so it’s great to see people start showing their dogs, especially if it’s something they had never previously considered.” About 20,000 dogs from more than 200 different breeds are descending on Birmingham’s NEC on Thursday for the first Crufts show in two years, after last year’s event was cancelled due to Covid. As well as best in show, competitions include agility, heelwork and flyball, with Crufts anticipating record UK interest – although international numbers are down. “Working from home has opened up dog ownership for a lot more people and there was obviously huge demand for dogs during lockdown, but I think that has extended now and people are looking at other activities to do with their dog, beyond normal pet ownership,” said Lambert. For years, Pam Reakes had wanted a long-haired weimaraner, a large high-energy gun dog, and when lockdown came she decided she finally had the time to invest in caring for the breed. “In lockdown everybody was wanting a dog, so I had to go on a waiting list, and I finally got Wilma in December 2020,” she said. “She kept me sane all through lockdown, and she kept me fit. And now it’s given me a whole new circle of friends, a whole new hobby.” When Reakes first bought Wilma, she had never even thought about dog competitions. She said: “I posted some photos on Facebook and the breeder asked if I had thought about showing her [in competitions]. I nearly fell off my chair. “I was terrible at first, I couldn’t run properly and looked awful. I am still not exactly where I want to be, but I am so much better than I was.” Reakes entered her first dog show in May 2021, aged 61, taking home a second and third win, which qualified the pair for Crufts. “I am healthier and happier than I have been in a long time,” she said. “I am scared to death about competing on Sunday but I am so excited about going. I thought I might go and watch Crufts again, but I never dreamt I would actually be in the ring competing.” Martha Turgoose, 11, had always wanted a dog, but it was not until her father moved to working from home permanently during lockdown that the family were able to get one: a lagotto romagnolo called Bruno. Martha’s mother, Liz Turgoose, said: “Me and my husband both worked full-time so we couldn’t get a dog, but now my husband only goes in one day a week. “Martha took on the job of training him for shows during lockdown, when she was doing school from home. Being with him all the time definitely helped them develop the bond they need to compete.” On Sunday Martha will be competing in Bruno’s breed class, and in the young handler 6-11 category. “She asked to go to Crufts for her ninth birthday in 2020,” said Liz. “And now she’s going to compete. I’m so proud and it’s given her so much confidence.” But lockdown also came with its challenges for dog owners. When Nicola Collett, 54, first acquired Watson the Italian spinone in May 2020, she said it was difficult to socialise him due to social distancing rules. “We travelled further afield to find outdoor training classes that were still allowed. We couldn’t take him to shows to get him used to the crowds either,” she said. “Had we not done that and really tried, I don’t think we will be where we are today. But we made it. We’re competing at Crufts on Sunday, and we can’t wait to see how he does.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"New dogs, new tricks: lockdown puppy boom changes face of Crufts",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/09/new-dogs-new-tricks-lockdown-puppy-boom-changes-face-of-crufts-2022
3/9/2022,"Ukraine will try to evacuate civilians from six besieged cities, including the port of Mariupol where conditions are described as “apocalyptic”, along safe routes agreed with Moscow, the country’s deputy prime minister has said. Iryna Vereshchuk said Ukrainian forces would hold their fire in the areas concerned during a 12-hour window from 9am until 9pm local time on Wednesday, and she appealed to Russian forces to observe their “official public commitment” to do the same. Referring to multiple previous attempts to evacuate civilians that were aborted after so-called “humanitarian corridors” came under fire, she said Ukraine already had “negative experiences of when commitments undertaken did not work”. Ukrainian authorities said the routes should allow civilians from heavily bombed Mariupol, Enerhodar, Sumy, Izyum and Volnovakha to leave, and residents of several towns around Kyiv, including Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel, to get to the capital. Initially at least, the civilians would be evacuated to destinations inside Ukraine. Kyiv has repeatedly rejected proposals from Moscow for safe routes offering fleeing civilians escape only to Russia or its ally Belarus, calling the plans “cynical and immoral”. After buses carried about 7,000 civilians – including 1,700 foreign students – out of Sumy on Tuesday, the city’s mayor, Oleksandr Lysenko, said on Wednesday that civilians in private cars were starting to leave along the same corridor, with priority for pregnant women, women with children, and elderly and disabled people. The mayor of Enerhodar, Dmytro Orlov, said a temporary ceasefire was in force that would allow buses with humanitarian supplies into the south-eastern city, which has been under heavy fire. “On the way back they will pick up civilians who want to leave” for the nearby city of Zaporizhzhia, he said. International aid groups were most concerned, however, to ensure the successful evacuation of encircled Mariupol, where hundreds of thousands of residents have been sheltering from brutal Russian shelling and missile attacks for more than a week without water, power or heating. Phone signals are also down. Attempts on Tuesday to begin the process of bussing about half the besieged city’s 400,000 desperate inhabitants out via a “humanitarian corridor” were abandoned after the Ukrainian government accused Russian forces of shelling it. The Red Cross has described conditions in Mariupol as “apocalyptic”, while Vereshchuk said the humanitarian situation in the besieged city was “catastrophic” and Ukraine’s president, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, compared levels of devastation and suffering to those caused by the Nazis in the second world war. Journalists in the city described corpses lying in the streets and hungry people breaking into stores in search of food and melted snow for water, while thousands sheltered in basements. Authorities are reportedly planning to start digging mass graves. Filippo Grandi, the head of the UN’s refugee agency UNHCR, said on Wednesday that up to 2.2 million people had fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. “The time is now to try to help at the border” rather than get involved in discussions on the division of refugees between countries, he said. As fighting continued across the country, Ukraine’s general staff said on Wednesday that its armed forces were building up defences in cities in the north, south and east, and that forces around Kyiv were “holding the line” and resisting an apparently stalled Russian offensive with unspecified strikes. While the capital has been relatively quiet in recent days, Russian forces have continued to pound its outskirts and suburbs. The head of the Kyiv regional government, Oleksiy Kuleba, said on Wednesday that Russia was “artificially creating a humanitarian crisis in the Kyiv region”. Ukrainian officials said Russian shelling had made it impossible to move the bodies of five people who died when their vehicle was fired upon on the outskirts of Kyiv as well as the bodies of 12 patients of a psychiatric hospital where about 200 patients remain without food and medicine. The British defence ministry said in its latest assessment of the military situation that fighting north-west of Kyiv was “ongoing” and Russian forces were “failing to make any significant breakthroughs”. Ukrainian air defences “appear to have enjoyed considerable success against Russia’s modern combat aircraft, probably preventing them achieving any degree of control of the air”, it said, but it added that the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol “remain encircled and continue to suffer heavy Russian shelling”. The US on Tuesday rejected a proposal to provide Washington with MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland, saying it was “not tenable” for jets to take off from a US airbase in Germany and fly into contested Ukrainian airspace. Poland reiterated on Wednesday that it was ready to act, “only within the framework of Nato”. Ukraine has asked western countries to provide fighter jets to respond to the Russian invasion. But on Tuesday, after Poland said it was ready to deploy all of its MIG-29 jets to Ramstein airbase in Germany for the US and urged other Nato members to do the same, the Pentagon dismissed the offer as not “tenable”. Three rounds of peace talks between the two sides have so far yielded no progress, with Moscow continuing to insist Ukraine must “demilitarise” and enshrine neutrality in its constitution before it will halt what it calls a “special military operation” aimed at ensuring Russia’s security. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was due to meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, and the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, on the sidelines of a summit being hosted on Wednesday in the resort city of Antalya by Turkey, a Nato member. Russia said on Wednesday that it was working on a “broad response” to an unprecedented range of international financial and economic sanctions that appear certain to plunge Russia’s economy into its gravest crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The US president, Joe Biden, this week imposed an immediate ban on Russian oil and other energy imports, while Shell, McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, KFC, Starbucks, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are temporarily suspending their businesses in Russia. Britain unveiled new aviation sanctions on Wednesday that will give it the power to detain any Russian aircraft and ban aviation or space-related exports to Russia.",News/World news,Ukraine makes fresh move to help civilians leave ‘apocalyptic’ Mariupol,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/ukraine-mariupol-civilians-russia-war
