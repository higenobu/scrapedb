3/23/2022,"By Yuka Obayashi and Kantaro Komiya TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese turned off neon signs, dimmed their lights and dialled down thermostats on Tuesday after the government issued an urgent call to save energy to avoid blackouts after an earthquake last week caused a serious power shortage. Up to 3 million households faced the threat of blackouts on Tuesday night, as utility Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) warned of tight supply and surging demand as snow fell across Tokyo and the temperature dropped to 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 Fahrenheit). But by later in evening, the country appeared likely to avoid blackouts, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said. Still, authorities were keeping a power-supply warning in place for Wednesday, public broadcaster NHK said, meaning the world's no.3 economy could still face blackouts. A similar warning for the northeastern area was lifted, NHK said. A magnitude 7.4 earthquake last week off the northeastern coast - the same region devastated by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011 - temporarily cut power to about 2 million households, including hundreds of thousands in Tokyo. ""At this rate, we are coming closer to a state where we will have to conduct power outages similar to those that took place after the quake,"" the trade minister, Koichi Hagiuda, said earlier on Tuesday. The quake hit six thermal plants, knocking them out of operation in areas served by Tepco and Tohoku Electric Power Co, and the damage could leave some of them idle for weeks or even months, Hagiuda said. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno earlier called on residents in eastern Japan affected by the power crisis to do their part, including by lowering thermostats to around 20C (68F) and switching off unnecessary lights. Numerous users responded to the call. National broadcaster NHK dimmed its studio lights while electronics retailer Bic Camera turned off about half of the televisions at dozens of its stores. The 634-metre (693-yard) Tokyo Skytree tower turned off its lights for the whole day for the first time and operators of the city-centre Tokyo Tower lit up only its bottom half. 'RESTART NUCLEAR POWER' Retail giant Seven & I Holdings said 8,500 7-Eleven stores set their thermostats to 20C - one degree cooler than usual - while its Ito-Yokado supermarkets were dimming their lights by 10%. Nissan Motor said it was using an in-house power generator for 13 hours at its factory north of the capital. Many individual consumers also did their bit. ""I use the heater a lot so I will try to do my part to save energy,"" said college student Shuntaro Ishinabe, 22. Government spokesperson Matsuno said the request to save energy was unlikely to extend beyond Tuesday, given an expected rise in temperatures and the addition of more solar power generation as the weather improved. Japan has faced a tough energy market since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami crippled Tepco's Fukushima Daiichi plant, causing the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl and leading to the suspension of operations at most of Japan's nuclear reactors. With energy prices surging on tight global supply and the Ukraine crisis, Japan's biggest business lobby, Keidanren, has been calling for a swift restart of the nuclear plants. ""A sudden halt of energy causes a lot of problems, and I think (the general public) has really felt the importance of energy security given recent events,"" Keidanren Chairman Masakazu Tokura said. ""Given the larger trend to become carbon neutral and cut back on greenhouse gases, I believe there will be more difficulties unless we restart nuclear power plants swiftly.""

3/23/2022,"The US is sending billions of dollars' worth of security assistance to Ukraine. The latest aid package includes more US-made Stinger anti-aircraft and Javelin anti-tank missiles. It also includes 100 Switchblade drones, designed for one-way missions against enemy targets. The latest package of US assistance to Ukraine, worth $800 million, is packed with weapons that can take a toll on invading Russian forces. FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank weapons, FIM-92 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, and AT-4 anti-tank unguided missiles, as well as grenade launchers, body armor, and tens of millions of bullets, are just some of the security aid the US is sending Kyiv. The latest package also includes 100 Switchblade tactical unmanned systems — also known as ""kamikaze drones"" — that could make life for Russian troops even harder. First developed to counter insurgents in Afghanistan, the Switchblade has become a staple of the US military's conventional and special-operations arsenals. There are two versions of the Switchblade drone, Switchblade 300 and Switchblade 600. What differentiates them is the size of the munition they carry. The Switchblade 300 carries an explosive charge the size of a Claymore mine — which is made out of C-4 explosive and hundreds of small metal ball bearings — and is designed to take out infantry and artillery targets. At 2 feet and slightly over 5 pounds, the Switchblade 300 can be launched from a small tube akin to a mortar. It has a speed of 100 mph but a very short operational range of only 15 minutes (or 6 miles), thus making it truly tactical. The Switchblade 600 packs a larger explosive charge. It has a bigger operational range of 40 minutes (or 24 miles) and a cruising speed of 70 mph, but it's also heavier, at 120 pounds. With an explosive charge similar to that of the Javelin anti-tank missile, the Switchblade 600 is designed to take out tanks and armored targets. Both loitering munitions have an onboard sensor with GPS to guide them to the target, and they can strike both mobile and stationary objects. They also include a ""wave off"" function that allows the operator to abort a strike if the circumstances on the ground change — for example, if civilians approach the target. US Special Operations Command has been using the Switchblade 300 since the early 2010s, and in September it awarded the military contractor AeroVironment a $20 million contract for the Switchblade 600. ""We've been using Switchblades for some time now. They are really effective downrange because they put distance between the operator and his target. It was really effective in Syria and Iraq against ISIS,"" a Green Beret assigned to a National Guard unit told Insider. ISIS fighters often attempted to take out special-operations teams or their forward-operating bases with car bombs. ""On some rare occasions, we would use Switchblades to take them out en route. It's also a good option for urban warfare because you can be very precise and avoid collateral damage,"" added the Green Beret, who was not authorized to speak to the media. In addition to carrying out strikes, Switchblades can gather tactical intelligence, conduct surveillance, do target acquisition, and provide reconnaissance for operators and help commanders develop better situational awareness on the battlefield. Switchblade 600 can ""track and engage non-line-of-sight targets and light armored vehicles with precision lethal effects,"" Brett Hush, vice president and product line general manager for tactical missile systems at AeroVironment, said after the company received the SOCOM contract. The 600 model can also be easily transported and deployed from fixed and mobile platforms, allowing operators to overwhelm targets while minimizing their exposure to enemy fire, Hush said. The difference between loitering munitions and large drones is simple: the former is designed to be expendable and the latter is designed to provide cheap and sustained intelligence-gathering and strike options to commanders. Once fired, there is no coming back for loitering munitions. They are tactical in nature and meant to solve problems a small unit would face on the ground. For instance, a platoon of Army Rangers or Navy SEALs in Afghanistan would use a Switchblade 300 to take out Taliban fighters who are escaping a compound on a motorbike. Larger drones, such as the MQ-9 Reaper or RQ-4 Global Hawk, are designed to provide near-constant coverage of the battlefield to allow commanders on the ground and back in headquarters to make more informed decisions. Armed drones like the Reaper can also provide close air support or conduct precision strikes. Loitering munitions are also cheaper. An MQ-9 costs $56 million, and one of the AGM-114 Hellfire missiles that it fires costs over $100,000. A Switchblade 300 costs about $6,000. Both are designated ""unmanned aerial systems,"" and despite their different roles, both are cost-effective ways to track and attack opposing forces while reducing the risk to their operators.

3/23/2022,"A Harvard-educated former Marine was sentenced Friday for raping a California woman in a kidnapping plot so bizarre police once suspected it was a hoax. Matthew Muller pleaded no contest to two counts of forcible rape, robbery, burglary and false imprisonment in connection with the Vallejo kidnapping of Denise Huskins, according to Law & Crime. Muller was sentenced to 31 years behind bars for the state-level charges as part of a plea deal with the Solano County District Attorney’s Office, which will run concurrently with a 40-year federal kidnapping sentence he’s already serving. Vallejo Police had initially believed Huskins had faked her own kidnapping, publicly hinting that it had been a hoax due to the bizarre and sensational details of the case. On Friday, Solano County prosecutor Sharon Henry called the initial police response a “travesty of justice” and admitted “mistakes were made,” KTVU reports. Huskins had been sleeping in her boyfriend Aaron Quinn’s bedroom when an armed man, wearing a scuba suit burst into the bedroom around 3 a.m. on March 23, 2015 and demanded the couple get into a closet, where he zip-tied their hands and feet, ABC News reported last year. The intruder placed blacked out goggles over their eyes and forced them to drink a “sleep-inducing” liquid, federal authorities said in 2016. They were instructed to listen to a pre-recorded message that threatened them with “face cutting or electric shock” if they failed to comply with the demands. The kidnapper, later identified as Muller, then drove Huskins to his South Lake Tahoe home, where he held her for two days and sexually assaulted her, before ultimately driving her to Huntington Beach and letting her go near her parent’s home. Before the intruder left Quinn’s Vallejo home with Huskins in tow, he had forced Quinn, who would later marry Huskins after the ordeal, to stay on a couch, telling him that a camera on the wall would be watching him and instructing him not to go beyond a taped perimeter marked on the floor. He also instructed Quinn not to call authorities, but when Quinn awoke from his drug-induced slumber later that morning, he called his FBI agent brother, who urged him to call 911, according to ABC News. Vallejo Police initially suspected the kidnapping was a hoax, saying publicly that the couple had “plundered valuable resources away from our community and taken the focus away from the true victims of our community,” according to SF Gate.  Some even compared Huskins to a real life ""Gone Girl,"" a reference to the popular movie where a woman stages her own kidnapping. It wasn’t until another similar home-invasion burglary in Alameda County on June 5, 2015 that investigators would discover the truth.  Muller was arrested in that case after dropping his cellphone in a scuffle with the homeowners, SFist reports.  While searching his South Lake Tahoe home, investigators discovered evidence connected to Huskins’ abduction. Huskins would later sue the Vallejo Police Department for how they handled the case and was awarded a $2.5 million settlement.   Attorney Anthony Douglas Rappaport stands with clients, Denise Huskins and her boyfriend Aaron Quinn, right, in San Francisco at a 2016 news conference.  Photo: AP Photo/Sudhin Thanawala  In a statement obtained by Oxygen.com last year, Vallejo Police issued a public apology to Huskins and Quinn, saying said the case was “not publicly handled with the type of sensitivity a case of this nature should have been handled with.” “What happened to Ms. Huskins and Mr. Quinn is horrific and evil. As the new Chief of Police, I am committed to making sure survivors are given compassionate service with dignity and respect,” Chief Shawny Williams said at the time. “Although I was not chief in 2015 when this incident occurred, I would like to extend my deepest apology to Ms. Huskins and Mr. Quinn for how they were treated during this ordeal.” Muller, a former Marine who had once studied at Harvard Law School, was sentenced to 40 years for federal kidnapping charges in 2017.  However, last week, Henry said “full justice was not achieved” and that Muller still needed to be held accountable for raping Huskins and traumatizing Quinn.  “He deserved justice, and Denise Huskins Quinn also deserved justice related to the sexual assault crimes that were committed against her,” Henry said, according to KTVU.  The state-level case had initially been delayed after Muller’s mental health had been called into question.  The state was finally able to proceed with the case last week and Muller appeared via Zoom from the Napa State Hospital, where he pleaded no contest to the charges against him.  Henry later said she hoped the plea would “bring justice to the victims.”  “My heart goes out to them and the healing process takes a very long time,” she said of Huskins and Quinn, according to KNTV. “Based on my conversation with them, they are trying their best to move on.”  Oxygen.com reached out to the Solano County District Attorney’s Office, but did not receive an immediate response.",U.S./Oxygen,Ex-Marine Sentenced For Raping California Woman In Bizarre Kidnapping Plot That Was Once Mistakenly Labeled A Hoax,https://news.yahoo.com/ex-marine-sentenced-raping-california-174217300.html
