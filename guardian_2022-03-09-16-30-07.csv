3/9/2022,"It is an impossible bind. Joe Biden faces demands for America to do more as Ukrainian civilians are terrorized and killed by Russia. But he is also determined to avoid going down in history as the US president who started a third world war. Russia has pummeled Ukraine with more than 625 missiles so far, according to the Pentagon, causing untold death and destruction and prompting an exodus of 2m refugees. Vladimir Putin is now reportedly recruiting Syrian mercenaries and preparing to level cities in a bid to break Ukrainians’ will in the face of his invasion. In response, the US president has imposed unprecedented sanctions and joined allies in turning Russia into a global pariah. Last month he authorised $350m in military aid to Ukraine and he has given officials the go ahead to share intelligence with Kyiv at a “frenetic” pace. But none of this has prevented a humanitarian catastrophe that generates traumatic images on TVs and newspaper front pages. For many in America there is a sense of anger, frustration and impotence: why can the world’s biggest military superpower not intervene? A vocal minority contends that Biden can and should. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican congressman and veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, has urged Nato to declare a “no-fly zone” to disrupt Russian air operations and “give the heroic Ukrainians a fair fight”. The call has been echoed by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who accused Nato of “weakness” and “disunity” after the alliance ruled it out. But the Biden administration has firmly rejected the idea, wary that it might require US forces to shoot down Russian aircraft and so draw the two nuclear-armed nations into confrontation. Its caution-first approach posits a three-dimensional chess game in which one bad move could herald disaster. Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, told NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday: “For everything we’re doing for Ukraine, the president also has a responsibility to not get us into a direct conflict, a direct war, with Russia, a nuclear power, and risk a war that expands even beyond Ukraine to Europe. That’s clearly not our interest. What we’re trying to do is end this war in Ukraine, not start a larger one.” Most members of Congress appear to be on the same page. Both Democrats and Republicans have warned that, with his back against the wall and his state of mind in question, Putin could lash out in unpredictable ways. Republican Marco Rubio, vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, told ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos: “A no-fly zone has become a catchphrase. I’m not sure a lot of people fully understand what that means. That means flying Awacs [airborne warning and control system] 24 hours a day. That means the willingness to shoot down and engage Russian airplanes in the sky. “That means, frankly, you can’t put those planes up there unless you’re willing to knock out the anti-aircraft systems that the Russians have deployed, and not just in Ukraine, but in Russia and also in Belarus … It means starting world war III.” Biden is keenly aware how the law of unintended consequences has haunted past US presidents during military misadventures in Vietnam and Iraq. Neo-conservative nation-building has fallen into disrepute. Last year Biden ended the country’s longest war, in Afghanistan, so he has little appetite for starting a new one. But non-intervention also carries a moral price. In 2011, when Biden was vice-president, Barack Obama declared that the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad should step aside, but he resisted calls to send in US troops even as the regime killed, jailed, tortured and unleashed chemical weapons on its own people. Hawks in Washington are urging Biden to avoid a similar scenario. John Bolton, a member of Republican administrations since Ronald Reagan was president, said: “If you believe that you put Nato’s planes in the sky over Ukraine and there’s an engagement between a Nato plane and a Russian plane, and from that one single engagement in an instant you’re at world war III, then you have given Russia incredible leverage over us. “They’re now deterring us and that really is the argument: ‘No-fly zone will lead to world war III.’ That’s not true.” Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator, went even further by suggesting in a tweet that Putin should be assassinated – a comment that illustrated how quickly hostile rhetoric could spiral out of control. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, responded flatly: “That is not the position of the United States government and certainly not a statement you’d hear come from the mouth of anybody working in this administration.” Short of a no-fly zone, Zelenskiy has asked for Soviet-era MiG-29 jets, which Ukrainian pilots are capable of operating. On Tuesday Poland agreed to send all its MiG-29s “immediately and free of charge” to an American air base in Germany so they can be delivered to Ukraine. But the timing remains uncertain. Ben Sasse, a Republican member of the Senate intelligence committee, said: “The clock is ticking and Russia is attacking Ukraine’s airfields. President Biden needs to get this MiG transfer done and he needs to get it done today. Ukraine doesn’t have time for paperwork. Load these MiGs up and get them to Ukrainian pilots who can still make a difference. Don’t slow walk this.” But the Pentagon then appeared to scupper – or at least delay – the plan, saying it was not “tenable”. In a statement, the Pentagon said the prospect of the jets departing from a US airbase “to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire Nato alliance”. In the meantime Biden has banned all imports of Russian oil and gas, “targeting the main artery of Russia’s economy” despite domestic political risks, and raised the level of US troops in Europe to about 100,000. He is locked in the most dangerous showdown with a Russian leader since John F Kennedy went head to head with Nikita Khrushchev in the Cuban missile crisis 60 years ago. Lawrence Haas, a former communications director for Vice-President Al Gore and author of the book The Kennedys in the World, said: “Biden needs to calibrate his response to reduce the chances that this crisis will escalate out of control. He has made clear that we’re not going to send US troops and Nato’s not going to send troops and I think that’s reasonable. “But I do believe that he could ramp up the sanctions to the maximum extent possible and also provide more weaponry to Ukraine to fight its own battle.”",News/US news,Biden’s impossible bind: how should the US tackle Russia’s invasion of Ukraine?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/08/joe-biden-ukraine-russia
3/9/2022,"About a year ago, my wife was filling in paperwork to hire a car when the woman behind the counter suddenly looked up in alarm. “I’m sorry,” she said in a stage whisper. “The computer is saying: ‘Do not rent to this woman under any circumstances.’ It seems you’re banned for life?” There was an awkward pause before she leaned forward conspiratorially and said: “What did you do?!” Good question. The short answer is nothing; my wife is innocent. What happened is this: she and I hired a car to visit her family for Thanksgiving and dropped it off in Boston at 9am. The company – which I won’t name because I don’t want it to set its lawyers on me – said we returned it at 9pm and insisted we pay them an extra $350. We said: “Hell, no,” so it referred us to debt collectors who hounded us for weeks. This could have had a terrible knock-on effect on our credit score and ability to get a mortgage, but a lawyer friend helped us get the issue dropped – except we hadn’t realised the company had banned my wife from ever using it or its many subsidiaries again. (Which we would never do by choice – however, rental car costs have gone up 43% and it was the cheapest option.) Being banned for life from a major car rental company is inconvenient, but our situation, which I strongly suspect was caused by a computer glitch, could have been far worse. Hertz is being sued by hundreds of US customers who allege they were wrongfully arrested after the rental company reported them to the police for stealing cars they say they had legitimately rented. A Nasa employee, who is part of the lawsuit, was allegedly arrested at gunpoint after Hertz reported the vehicle he had rented was stolen. One woman spent 40 days in jail – away from her kids and two-month-old baby – because she was arrested for car theft. Another customer spent seven months in jail and eventually signed a plea deal just to bring the ordeal to an end. The allegations against Hertz have been public since 2019, but the case is back in the news because a judge recently ordered Hertz to unseal documents that show the company filed more than 3,300 police reports about stolen vehicles involving its customers each year. (Hertz had been trying to argue those numbers were “trade secrets” and should be kept confidential). As USA Today noted in a new in-depth piece on the issue: “That means over the past seven years since false theft report cases have been known to occur, theft charges have been levied against more than 23,000 people. How many of them were innocent paying customers is unknown.” What exactly is going on? Nothing, according to Hertz. The company has described the accusations as baseless; it argues theft reports are “rare and happen only after exhaustive attempts to reach the customer”. The lawyers in the class action, meanwhile, argue that Hertz has a faulty computer system and can’t keep track of its inventory; instead of investigating “missing” cars itself, they say it outsources the work to police stations. The police, by the way, aren’t always thrilled about this – according to USA Today, court records show that “after multiple reports of stolen vehicles that ended up being located on Hertz’s lots, [some police] agencies reportedly said they wouldn’t take new reports from the company”. Obviously I don’t know all the facts in the ongoing Hertz lawsuit. But the case has striking parallels with the UK’s Post Office scandal, where hundreds of postal workers were accused of theft due to a faulty computer system designed by Fujitsu; scores of lives were ruined because management trusted technology over low-paid workers. It’s not just technology that is to blame, of course – it’s an economic and legal system that protects and prioritises corporations over people. And that is not a bug in the system, it is a feature.

3/9/2022,"As Russia threatens to cut off the fossil gas on which much of Europe depends, the continent’s storage facilities are a crucial line of defence. So you’ll be glad to hear that Germany possesses a massive gas storage reservoir, under the town of Rehden, in Lower Saxony. The biggest strategic reserve in western Europe, it can hold enough fossil gas to supply 2 million households for a year. You’ll be less delighted to discover who owns it. It belongs to a company called Astora. Astora is a subsidiary of the Russian state company Gazprom. Altogether, it owns about one-quarter of Germany’s gas stores. All of them are almost empty. They have been run down to 10% or less of their capacity. According to the German minister for economic affairs and climate action, these storage facilities have been “systematically emptied”. Idiocy is nested within idiocy like a stack of Russian dolls. Germany has allowed private companies to control its strategic reserve, and has imposed no legal requirements on how much gas the reserve should hold. Nor has it prevented companies controlled by foreign states from owning it. Instead, like the UK, it has ceded this crucial security issue to a mysterious deity it calls “the market”. With the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, Germany hooked itself to Russian gas, even as analysts warned that this might become a major strategic liability. Their warnings have been vindicated: this is the pipeline Russia is now threatening to shut in retaliation for sanctions. As if to reinforce its dependency, in 2005 Germany commissioned a second pipeline, Nord Stream 2. The approval was rushed through by Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, just before he left office. Within weeks, he was appointed to run the Nord Stream AG shareholder committee, overseeing the pipeline’s construction. He later joined the boards of several Gazprom companies, and became chair of Rosneft, the Russian state oil company. Why does Germany need Russian gas so badly? Partly because in 2011, after the Fukushima disaster, the federal government decided to shut down all its nuclear plants, owing to the risk of tsunamis in Bavaria. The nuclear shutdown is to Germany what Brexit is to the UK: a needless act of self-harm, driven by misinformation and the irrational allocation of blame. Within two months of this ruling, Gazprom and the German company RWE signed a memorandum of understanding. It stated that “in light of recent decisions by the German government to reduce their nuclear power programmes, we see good prospects for the construction of new modern gas-fired power plants in Germany”. In 2019, Angela Merkel explained to the World Economic Forum: “We will have phased out nuclear energy by 2022. We have a very difficult problem … we cannot do without baseload energy. Natural gas will therefore play a greater role for another few decades … it’s perfectly clear that we’ll continue to obtain natural gas from Russia.” Germany now relies on Russia for 49% of its gas supply. Technically and politically, it seems to be too late to reverse this crazy decision, which replaced a low-carbon source of electricity with a high-carbon source. As a result of these stacked idiocies, Russia doesn’t have to wage war on Germany to inflict deadly harm. It needs only to cut off the gas. A similar dependency afflicts much of Europe, which collectively receives 41% of its gas imports and 27% of its oil imports from Russia, as well as almost half its imported coal. While our government has promised to phase out Russian oil by the end of 2022, this year alone the UK is likely to fund his war machine to the tune of £2bn in payments for liquefied gas. Gas and oil, and the banks that finance them, are among the Russian businesses that have not been sanctioned by the EU, the UK and the US, though they represent, by a long way, Russia’s most important source of foreign exchange. Why not? Because we have reduced ourselves to craven dependency on that despotic government, through a dismal failure to wean ourselves off fossil fuels. While we sternly condemn Vladimir Putin, we quietly slip him the money required to sustain his atrocities in Ukraine. Like a ruthless pusher, he exploits our addiction. Even before the invasion of Ukraine, Europe had a gas crisis, and households faced soaring heating bills. Today we have a gastastrophe. We are lucky in just one respect: that Putin invaded Ukraine in the spring, rather than the autumn. Now we have until October – when major heating demand kicks in again – to implement the comprehensive energy transition that should have happened years ago. Can it be done so quickly? Yes. When governments want to act, they can do so with great force and effect. When the US joined the second world war, it transformed itself from a largely civilian economy to a military economy in a similar period. Manufacturing, services, administration: all were comprehensively retooled. Almost everyone, in one way or another, was mobilised to support the war effort. The federal government spent more money between 1942 and 1945 than it did between 1789 and 1941. With similar determination and resources, rolling out a massive programme of home insulation, heat pumps, renewable energy, public transport and other mature technologies, we could transform ourselves from a high- to a low-carbon economy just as swiftly and decisively. And, perhaps, go further. On the promise of a scientific discovery that was only three years old, in late 1941 President Roosevelt approved a strategic programme to develop two entirely new technologies. Both were delivered in less than four years. That these were nightmare technologies (explosion and implosion nuclear weapons) does not detract from the principle: when governments use their power, the old rules that are held to determine what is possible no longer apply. I wonder what would happen if governments invested similar resources and political will in the development of kinder nuclear technologies, including new designs for small modular reactors and the fusion programme. I suspect things could shift at extraordinary speed. The measures needed to forestall environmental catastrophe are the same as those required to release ourselves from dependency on the autocratic governments and ecocidal corporations that control the world’s fossil fuels. Starving the Russian military machine of funds, preventing the collapse of life on Earth: we can do both at once. So what are we waiting for?

3/9/2022,"Observant Parisians at the city’s Gare de Lyon 50 years ago this month might have noticed a new type of traveller passing through the station. The well-heeled holidaymakers bound for the Riviera were there as usual. But now they were joined by the Interrail pioneers, all under 21 and more likely to be carrying backpacks than suitcases. They and their guitars were on the move, taking advantage of what was promoted as a one-off opportunity: pay £27.50 to explore Europe by train for a month. In those days that freedom to roam was a privilege of youth. The first passes went on sale in March 1972, and the scheme was so successful that it became a regular offer and in time was opened to all. Fifty years on, Interrail passes are popular with travellers of all ages and the pioneers of 1972 are now drawing pensions. Many of those spring travellers at the Gare de Lyon were en route to the Riviera, the older ones making a seasonal pilgrimage to Antibes, Nice, Juan-les-Pins or Menton. For the Interrail cohort, the journey mattered more than the destination, but would be all the better if at some stage they washed up in Saint-Tropez, newly propelled to prominence by the marriage of Mick and Bianca Jagger where the guestlist included Julie Christie and Brigitte Bardot. The most illustrious daytime express to the Côte d’Azur was Le Mistral, with posh air-conditioned carriages (a rarity in 1972), two restaurant cars, ahairdressing salon and even a bookstall. But this wasn’t for the lowly young travellers: Interrail wasn’t accepted on many premium French trains. So while the chic set sped south on Le Mistral (or the overnight Train Bleu), the youths with rucksacks and Interrail passes relied on slower trains. Some only made it to Mâcon or Montélimar. Others, demonstrating an enviable ability to sleep in overcrowded compartments – or even corridors – continued through the night to the Mediterranean. These days, fast TGVs dash from Paris to Marseille in just over three hours, conveying both regular ticket-holders and Interrailers. For a modest supplement (usually €10 or €20) even the latter can nowadays speed to the Mediterranean in comfort. But it is still possible to travel from Paris to the Mediterranean without recourse to the modern high-speed lines and see something of the French countryside by following instead the classic PLM railway taken by the Interrail pioneers half a century ago. PLM is shorthand for Compagnie des chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée, and the route is doable with just one change of train, in Lyon, though some itineraries include additional changes at Dijon or Avignon. PLM was the company that commissioned, from French illustrator Roger Broders, the posters that helped seal the Riviera in the public imagination. Though PLM had long been consigned to corporate history by 1972, the PLM route became a key artery for early pass holders. The slower trains that still use the old PLM line out of Paris are not grand enough to command platform space at today’s Gare de Lyon. They are relegated to Paris Bercy, where there’s not a hint of Riviera romance on a dull November morning as I await the 07.33 to Lyon. This is not Le Mistral, but a humble French regional train with only second-class carriages. The train is comfy in a time-worn way and cyclists can take bikes for free. Its humbler pace affords more opportunities to engage with the passing landscape and get a feel for the distance travelled. Soon we are slipping by the forests of Fontainebleau and following the Yonne Valley through pleasant countryside, pausing here and there at market towns. Shortly after stopping at Joigny, we slip under the high-speed line just as a TGV dashes by overhead. Now in the Armançon Valley, we pass Tanlay and Ancy before skirting Mont Auxois, where Julius Caesar defeated the Gallic tribes. Then we drop down steeply to reach the Ouche Valley and Dijon. Two hours later, having seen a fine sweep of Burgundy grand cru vineyards, I alight in Lyon just as a TGV from Paris pulls in at an adjacent platform. That fast train has taken just two hours from Paris; my journey has taken five. Slow travel is about making the most of the travelling. Shouldn’t we all occasionally take time out for a proper journey, one where the pleasure of the ride is not eclipsed by the anticipation of arrival? That’s why I broke the trip with an overnight stop in Lyon. On the way back north, I made it a three-day trip, with stops in Valence and Beaune. Next morning, it’s another four hours on a similar regional train to Marseille, following the Rhône downstream from Lyon and name-checking vineyards on the way. There’s Côte Rôtie and Condrieu on the far side of the river, and soon we are slipping by Hermitage. Cement-grey skies give way to sunshine south of Valence, with Châteauneuf-du-Pape on the right and a distant view of Mont Ventoux far away to the left. The one-way fare from Paris to Marseille via this old PLM route is about €115, which makes those first Interrail passes seem a bargain. And, as a journey with frequent stops along the way, this route really is perfectly suited to Interrail. No supplements, and just hop on and off as you please. Perhaps, as Europe marks 50 years of Interrail, 2022 is our chance to rediscover the exquisite pleasure of those slower journeys which were the backbone of so many early Interrail adventures.

A few weeks ago, I started receiving letters from Virgin Money telling me about an “exciting new credit card app”. As I don’t have a smartphone, and use my laptop for online banking, I didn’t think it applied to me. However, when I recently tried to transfer money from my current account to my credit card account, the latter had vanished. I was told by the bank that my credit card could only be managed by the “exciting new credit card app”. At no point during our correspondence was it mentioned this would be the case for a laptop user.CB, Ilkley, West Yorkshire Virgin Money’s decision boils down to money. Or, in its own words, to “focusing our development resource” on “customer preference”. Maintaining a secure website and an app is expensive and, if banks decide that they can shave their budgets and dress it up as an improvement, they are unlikely to be squeamish about the minority of customers who are disconnected. Virgin argues that only a “small percentage” of customers were reliant only on the non-mobile online service, and points them to the online chat function for “basic” requests. Basic requests do not, however, include making a payment, for which you’ll now have to ring the contact centre. Customers who do have a smartphone, and used Virgin’s existing app to manage their accounts, have voiced their displeasure after discovering their credit card accounts had vanished from that one, too. To make its service “quicker and easier”, Virgin has separated the new credit card app from the general banking app, so customers now have to download the two apps, and set up a direct debit or register their credit card and current account as payees, to transfer funds between them. Campaigners have warned that technological advances, that make banking more convenient for the majority, can exclude older and poorer people who don’t want or can’t afford up-to-date smartphones. “Virgin’s decision to only allow digital access through smartphones is a step too far, too quickly,” says James Daley of Fairer Finance. “It should retain its online banking systems for those who still rely on them and only shut down old processes when it can confidently say that all customers are now supported.” Email your.problems@observer.co.uk.

3/9/2022,"Australia’s states and the ACT have almost doubled their borrowings in the past three years, placing them on track to hit the half-trillion dollar debt mark by mid-year, according to rating agency S&P Global. The borrowing binge comes as the Morrison government projects almost $1tn in net debt by the 2024-25 fiscal year, with commonwealth outlays on the economy and health during the Covid pandemic amounting to more than 14% of gross domestic product. By contrast, the biggest increase in such spending among the states was in NSW, at about 4.5% of economic activity. “We expect the debt burdens of most Australian states to rise as they grapple with the aftershocks of the pandemic and ramp up infrastructure investment,” S&P said. S&P Global has an interesting report out today, showing how Australian states' and the ACT's debt will hit the half trillion-dollar mark by mid-2022. pic.twitter.com/6GkcctH0e3 “The escalation in debt across eastern Australian states is proportionally larger than that of most comparable overseas peers, such as German states and Canadian provinces,” the report said. S&P cut its debt rating for NSW debt by one notch in December 2020 and two notches for Victoria. Downgrades typically result in higher borrowing costs as borrowers have to pay a higher interest rate to sell the debt. The ratings agency has a “negative” outlook for South Australia and ACT’s debt, implying a one-in-three chance they will face a downgrade, said Martin Foo, S&P’s primary credit analyst. S&P Global also had this interesting graph too on which governments had been the biggest spenders during the past couple of pandemic years...seems like there's a pattern: pic.twitter.com/cVWixeh1ZV Foo said the looming $500bn debt landmark did not imply debt would spiral out of control, adding the projections were “already built into our base case”. S&P was “comfortable broadly with the credit ratings where they are”. Victoria’s debt load was higher than NSW as a proportion of the population, gross state product, and as a proportion of revenues, he said. State debt, though, had risen 90% since the 2019-20 fiscal year, representing an “extraordinary change in political sentiment”, the report said. And it's worth remembering that our 'fastest GDP growth rate"" in decades has been largely debt-fuelled, particularly as the federal level. According the mid-year forecasts from last November, the $1 trillion net debt 'landmark' is not that far down the track. pic.twitter.com/PzkaFTg9fE S&P described the shift as an “only Nixon could go to China” moment, with centre right governments leading the spending growth. “Intervention by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) provided political cover for states to go large,” it said. Foo said “conservative governments who might have once been very concerned about debt and deficits are probably less concerned or have eased some of that concern over the past three years”. The NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, said his state had spent $45bn in health and economic programs to get through the pandemic. Much of that had gone to protect “the fabric of the economy”, such as ensuring workers remained connected to their companies, allowing them to rebound as Covid restrictions eased. “We will always put people before the budget,” Kean said. “That’s why we invested to keep our community safe through the pandemic.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Still, the government would have to make way for businesses to drive growth in the future. “The private sector will be able to take over and fill the gap,” he said.

3/9/2022,"The chances of England defending their World Cup title shrunk dramatically after they lost their group-stage match against West Indies by seven runs, in a nail-biting scrap. At 156-8 in 35 overs, chasing 225, England looked down and out, but a record 61-run ninth-wicket partnership between Kate Cross (27) and Sophie Ecclestone (33 not out) took them agonisingly close. It was off-spinner Anisa Mohammed who finally sunk their hopes, getting her fingertips to the ball to run out Cross backing up in the 48th over, before clean bowling Anya Shrubsole three balls later to finish the job. For West Indies, a 123-run partnership for the fifth wicket between Shemaine Campbelle (66) and Chedean Nation (49 not out) proved crucial, while Hayley Matthews – who scored a century in her side’s opening game – chipped in with 45 runs and the key wickets of Heather Knight and Nat Sciver, as England were all out for 218. Following on from a loss to Australia in their opening game, England now face an uphill struggle to qualify for the semi-finals, while West Indies have become the unlikely challengers for the title, having also beaten hosts New Zealand on Friday. “We’ve obviously made it tricky for ourselves but no way are we out of this World Cup yet,” Knight said after play. “We can’t linger on it too much. We’ve got to take the things that we can do a lot better out of the game and make sure we’re focusing on the next one.” “That next game is crucial to our World Cup hopes. Hopefully that will sharpen people up, because at the moment we’re fighting for our lives in this tournament.” England’s chase was nervy from the start, after Lauren Winfield-Hill departed early courtesy of a spectacular catch from Deandra Dottin, diving full stretch to her left to pluck the ball out of the air at backward point. Matthews, introduced in the 10th over, then had Knight caught behind after an umpire review for a stumping showed an unexpected spike on Ultra Edge, before Sciver slogged her straight to mid-on. Tammy Beaumont, who had been put down by Mohammed at slip in single figures, clawed her way to 46 from 76 balls, but the bowler claimed her revenge in the 26th over, trapping her leg-before. Danni Wyatt (33) and Sophia Dunkley (38) combined for a 60-run partnership but when both fell within three balls of each other, it was left to the tail-enders to scrap it out. “We back our tail,” Knight said. “Sophie [Ecclestone] has worked so hard on her batting. It did feel very calm, they kept it very simple and just tried to tick off the total. The way they played was outstanding and showed real fight.” Earlier, West Indies had reached 81 without loss in the opening 20 overs, but were reduced to 98-4 by Ecclestone, who claimed figures of three for 20. Matthews miscued a catch to third man in the 21st over, while four balls later captain Stafanie Taylor edged behind for a duck to a brilliant ball that turned a mile. In between times, Dottin (31) fell victim to a sharp piece of fielding from Wyatt, who sprinted in from cover to throw down the stumps at the striker’s end and ran out the Barbadian. Wyatt followed that up with a good catch at cover, to hand Ecclestone her third. Campbelle and Nation, though, staged a recovery, helping West Indies to a tasty 47 runs from the final five overs after England squandered several opportunities to break the partnership – Shrubsole putting Campbelle down twice at short third man, while Amy Jones fumbled a run out. “We struggled to take wickets,” Knight admitted. “We were clear on our plans and we just didn’t quite execute at times.” It followed three earlier chances which had gone begging: Matthews was dropped twice, on five and 33, while England lost the chance to see off Dottin on the very first ball of the innings when Winfield-Hill shelled a leading edge at cover. Having treated the ball like a hot potato, England will be ruing what could have been, as they stare down the barrel ahead of their next match against South Africa on Monday.",Sport/Sport,England fall to second Women’s World Cup defeat as West Indies triumph in thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/09/england-fall-to-second-womens-world-cup-defeat-as-west-indies-triumph-in-thriller
3/9/2022,"Hello, I’m Warren Murray and here is how things stand on Wednesday morning. The US government has declined to act as a middleman in transferring fighter jets from Poland to Ukraine’s air force. Warsaw offered to send its MiG-29 planes – thought to number about 28, and which Ukraine’s pilots know how to fly – to the US air base Ramstein in Germany, if the US would supply Poland with comparable jets. The Pentagon said the jets flying from Germany into the Ukraine war zone would raise “serious concerns for the entire Nato alliance”. Washington added it would continue to consult with Poland and Nato about the issue. The US is putting two Patriot anti-missile batteries in Poland to bolster its defences. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has warned Russia that any attack on supply lines in Nato countries carrying arms and ammunition up to the Ukrainian border would be grounds for retaliation by the 30-member alliance. “An attack on Nato territory, on Nato forces, Nato capabilities, that would be an attack on Nato,” Stoltenberg said. Moscow officials have said they are ready to provide humanitarian corridors this morning for people fleeing Kyiv and four other cities. Ukrainian authorities in Kyiv have previously accused Moscow of shelling a similar refugee corridor meant to allow residents to escape the devastated port of Mariupol. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said 5,000 civilians were evacuated on Tuesday from the Sumy region after 21 people had been killed in air strikes. The US is banning imports of Russian oil and, after Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s rousing address to the Commons, the British government promised to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year. Venezuela has released at least two Americans from jail following a visit to Caracas by a high-level US delegation for talks that may lead to Venezuelan oil filling the gap. But Joe Biden has apparently had trouble getting in touch with Saudi and UAE leaders about supplying more oil. Keep up with further developments at our live blog. ‘Amazing display of temper’ – John Bercow should have been expelled from parliament had he remained an MP, an independent inquiry has found, describing him as a “serial bully”. It upheld 21 out of 35 complaints against the ex-Speaker by former staff. The panel gave its findings after Bercow appealed against an initial report by Kathryn Stone, the standards commissioner. The former Black Rod Lt Gen David Leakey said Bercow should be barred from holding public office or positions of leadership. Complainants described Bercow’s “amazing display of temper” including an incident where he “threw the mobile phone right in front of me on my desk and it burst into hundreds of bits and I could feel them hitting me”. Bercow described the inquiry as “a protracted, amateurish and unjust process which would not have survived five minutes’ scrutiny in court” and said the only outcome was that he should be denied a parliamentary pass, which he had not applied for. Midweek catch-up > Removing carbon dioxide from the air is essential if there is to be any chance of meeting global climate targets, a thinktank has warned, as switching to renewable energy alone will not produce enough carbon savings to limit heating to 1.5C. > Elon Musk has asked a federal judge to terminate his 2018 agreement with the US securities regulator requiring some of his tweets to be vetted by a lawyer. “The SEC’s pursuit of Mr Musk has crossed the line into harassment,” Musk’s lawyers wrote. > Sadiq Khan has called on ministers to grant him powers to freeze private rents in London to ease cost of living issues. His previous such calls have been rebuffed. Khan wants to freeze private rents for two years, saving tenants an average of £3,000. > Spain has announced plans to ban influencers, TV presenters and sports stars from advertising unhealthy food and drink to children. > Emmanuel Macron has promised to scrap France’s TV licence fee if he is re-elected as president, prompting questions over the funding and independence of public television and radio. England’s hidden children – The children’s commissioner for England has backed mandatory tracking of youngsters by local authorities. “[Local authorities] do not have an accurate figure of how many children there are in England – let alone the number of children not receiving education,” Rachel de Souza said. A report for De Souza calls for local authorities to collect and access more regularly updated data on children and their movements, including on immigration from the Home Office. One option would be a “unique identifier” for each child on databases that “would enable [local authorities] to better track children who move around the system”. Sturgeon’s apology to witches – Nicola Sturgeon has issued a posthumous apology to the more than 4,000 mostly women who were accused, convicted and often executed in Scotland under the Witchcraft Act of 1563. Speaking on International Women’s Day, Sturgeon said: “They were accused and killed because they were poor, different, vulnerable or in many cases just because they were women.” Sturgeon said this type of misogyny was “not yet historic. There are parts of our world where even today, women and girls face persecution and sometimes death because they have been accused of witchcraft.” Sturgeon welcomed in principle the recommendations made by Helena Kennedy’s working group on misogynist abuse, stating her government would respond formally as soon as possible. Shaun Walker has spent much of the first fortnight of the war in and around Kyiv. Travelling south to the port city of Odesa, he found even the Russian-speaking population were becoming hardened in disgust at Moscow’s invasion.

Jürgen Klopp insisted Liverpool deserved to progress to the Champions League quarter-finals despite a 1-0 defeat in the second leg of their tie with Internazionale. England’s second defeat of the Women’s World Cup – a narrow seven-run loss to the West Indies in Dunedin – has left little room for error if they are to qualify for the semi-finals. Jonny Bairstow saluted the return of England’s travelling supporters and reiterated his passion for Test cricket after a sublime unbeaten century delivered a telling fightback against the West Indies in Antigua. The Russian gymnast who provoked global anger by wearing a propaganda symbol in support of the invasion of Ukraine on a World Cup podium has insisted that he has no regrets – and would even do the same again if he gets the chance. Azeem Rafiq has accused senior county leaders of dragging their feet instead of opening their arms in cricket’s push for diversity. England are still hoping Tom Curry and Alex Dombrandt will be available to face Ireland after both forwards were included in a 26-man squad for Saturday’s penultimate Six Nations weekend. Any outbreak of peace between Phil Mickelson and the PGA Tour will need to be instigated by the player, the Tour’s commissioner has said. And Todd Boehly and Hansjörg Wyss have submitted their offer to buy Chelsea but they are yet to convince Roman Abramovich to sell the club to their consortium. The KFC parent company Yum has joined the flood of western companies quitting or pausing their operations in Russia as sanctions begin to bite against Vladimir Putin’s regime. Yum, which has seen Russia as a key growth market, follows McDonald’s, Starbucks, Pepsi and Coca-Cola in the last 24 hours. Markets were a bit steadier overnight but Brent crude added another 2% to $131. The FTSE100 is expected to jump around 1.3% at the opening while the pound is on $1.312 and €1.201. Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s invoking of the Churchillian legend proves irresistible for most of the front pages today. The Mail declares him a “Commons hero” and uses one of his most defiant lines as the headline: “We will fight until the end”. The Express salutes Zelenskiy’s “inspirational” and “historic” Commons speech with the headline: “We’ll fight in forests, fields and on shores”. The Guardian carries a picture of the packed chamber on its front pages and the headline “We will fight until the end, at sea, in the air. We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost”, although it leads with “‘Blow to Putin’: Britain and US ban Russian oil”. The FT has “US bans Russian oil as shelling forces Ukraine to halt fresh evacuation bid”. The Mirror’s headline is “We will never surrender”, although that is one famous Churchill line that Zelenskiy didn’t actually use. The Times uses a picture of the Commons chamber but leads with the offer by Poland: “Ukraine to get Nato jets”. The Telegraph has “Poland offers fighter jets for Ukraine”. The Scotsman says “Zelensky invokes Churchill in Ukraine’s darkest hour”, while the i splash headline is “We will fight in the forests and on the streets” and the Metro has “Hear hear hero” over a picture of MPs giving their standing ovation. The Sun has a small teaser to the Zelenskiy story but leads with a young Coldstream guardsman off to fight for Ukraine: “Queen’s guard AWOL to fight Vlad”.
