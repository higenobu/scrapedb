TikToker Jillian Orr (@jillianoreo) is a recent college graduate and LGBTQIA+ activist. Orr, who is bisexual, recently showed her pride by fabulously revealing a rainbow flag lining the inside of her gown when receiving her diploma from Brigham Young University, a conservative university owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Buried in debt? A financial expert weighs in on how to get back on track In a video Orr posted to TikTok, she explains over footage leading up to her bold statement that “at BYU, it’s against the honor code to be in a homosexual relationship.” Over a close-up shot of a rainbow flag being sewn to the inside of her graduation gown, Orr explains that if the school finds out that students are in a homosexual relationship or even just holding hands, “there are severe consequences.” Orr goes into further detail, claiming that BYU will threaten to expel students and rescind their degrees. Ultimately, “students are afraid to be who they are, so they hide out of fear until they get out,” Orr notes, over footage of her getting fitted for her graduation gown. Get Jordyn Woods's makeup look with these products: “I will not hide,” Orr declares over a shot of her turning around to show off the finished product. As she grabs the opening of her graduation gown for the big reveal, the clip cuts to Orr on graduation day, proudly displaying the rainbow flag sewn inside, while the words, “I will be seen,” appear on screen. The video cuts to a photo of Orr on stage at graduation, joyfully showing her gown’s rainbow flag interior “in front of the entire school” on the stadium’s jumbotron. Orr closes the video with two photos of her looking like a proud college graduate with a future as bright as her rainbow flag. While comments on Orr’s video have been turned off, there’s no doubt that her confidence in showing the world who she is will positively impact individuals of all ages.

5/19/2022,"Some books carry cautions lest they offend sensitive readers. Jake Adelstein’s came with an actual trigger warning. “Any publisher handling this book should have experience dealing with the yakuza,” ran one publisher's internal report on his memoir Tokyo Vice. “Serious security measures should be taken.” It wasn’t an idle threat. A few years before, Adelstein – a crime reporter for Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan’s national newspaper – had gotten wind of a racket involving Goto Tadamasa, the head of Yamaguchi-gumi, the largest and most violent of Tokyo’s mafia families. Goto discovered Adelstein was on his case and dispatched his henchman to rattle the reporter: kill the story, or we’ll kill you. Adelstein didn’t drop it. But he heeded the warning enough to employ an ex-yakuza boss as his bodyguard and driver for five years. “I always took it seriously,” he tells me over Zoom from his home in Japan. “His [the driver’s] salary always got paid on time, even if it meant I was eating ramen at the end of the month!” The first Japanese publisher he approached declined to take on Tokyo Vice. But it eventually appeared in 2009. An account of the 12 years Adelstein spent on the crime beat for the Yomiuri, it’s hard-boiled gem, taking in murder, suicide, self-immolation and – this being Japan – oodles of freaky, snap-on-your-rubber-gauntlets sex. But it’s also a moving coming-of-age tale. Adelstein arrived in Tokyo in the late 1980s as a gawky Midwestern college student, but through dedication – and a dash of self-mythologising – reinvented himself as a hard-charging investigative journalist, the first Westerner to pass Yomiuri’s ferocious entrance exams. His reporting, too, is a glimpse into a vanished era of journalism: pavements are pounded, sources strong-armed and contacts cultivated amidst the smoke-and-sake funk of late night dive bars. It looked a lot more fun before Twitter. Now his memoir has been adapted by HBO. Scripted by the Tony-award-winning playwright JT Rogers, with Ansel Elgort playing Adelstein, it is masterfully done. The cinematography renders Tokyo a neon-drenched maze, while the Elgort captures Adelstein’s charismatic cockiness and vulnerability in this strange, seedy world. In tone, it feels like a lost Michael Mann flick. (Mann, in fact, directed the first episode.) But it’s hard to overstate the unlikeliness of the real-life Adelstein. In conversation, he has an ebullient, Adam Sandlerish energy, spilling stories with the ease of a seasoned bar-propper. He grew up in McBaine, a tiny town outside Columbia, Missouri – “they used to say: ‘You never lose your girlfriend, you just lose your turn’” – and a fight in high school put him on to karate and, from there, an interest in Zen Buddhism. At college, he went on an exchange programme to study literature at Tokyo’s Sofia University – and never came back. In Tokyo, he taught English to a Zen Buddhist priest, living in a garret above the temple. And he helped pay the rent by translating kung-fu films into English and – another hazy vista in his extensive hinterland – giving Swedish massages to bored housewives. Most of all though, Tokyo whispered reinvention. “I thought, ‘Nobody knows me here, no-one knows my history of f***-ups’,” he remembers. “In my first year of college, I fell down a staircase and I was in a coma for a day. After that, my childhood memories were pretty scattered – so I couldn’t remember my childhood, and I was speaking a language which was completely alien. It was a very refreshing experience.” After college, he applied to join the Yomiuri, Japan’s most prestigious newspaper with a circulation of 12 million – at the time, the world’s largest title. To get in, he had to pass their gruelling four-hour Japanese language exams and a steeplechase of interview panels. The questions were unusual; at his final interview, one of the editors asked Adelstein, who is Jewish, whether he could work on the Sabbath and eat sushi. Oh, and whether Jews controlled the world economy. “I don’t think it was anti-Semitism, so much as ignorance,” he explains. “The Japanese love conspiracy theories. But I made a joke of it, and it worked out okay.” Still, the Yomiuri was a culture shock. As a rookie reporter, Adelstein had to adapt to the paper’s feudal corporate hierarchy, churning out busywork – typing up birth announcements, sports reports and scrap-booking – to keep up with its 12 daily editions. “We were tired all the time,” he remembers. “We didn’t feel like journalists, we felt like slaves. We weren’t even treated like real people. If someone wanted to get your attention they would just shout ‘first year’ and gesture at you.” Salaryman life had more outlandish rituals too. Berserker drinking sessions were the norm, and junior staff were expected to wait on their seniors. Adelstein even tells me how he knocked his boss flat at his first Bōnenkai, a no-holds-barred end of year party. “He had a good kick,” he chuckles. “But, you know, Japan is a very masculine culture and people get drunk and do stupid things.” It was around this time that Adelstein first met a yakuza. He remembers: “We went to his office in the red light district. It looked like a real estate agency in this very nondescript block. I was struck by how eloquent he was. He looked like a business man, wearing a very nice suit with these tattoos just poking out from his sleeves. I got to ask lots of questions about the yakuza, and he continued to be a good source for years.” Adelstein’s interactions with the yakuza and the cops were governed by giri, an honour-bound system of back-scratching that kept favours – and information – circulating around Tokyo’s underworld. A yakuza might inform on a rival gang to gain advantage over them; a cop might let slip about a potential raid to keep a friendly reporter on side. But burning sources, and exposing the delicate choreography of criminality, law enforcement and the media, was an excommunicable offence. What strikes you reading Tokyo Vice is the poised theatricality of the yakuza. In the 1990s, when Adelstein was entangled with them, they were in their full pomp, with more than 90,000 members, split between 22 officially recognised groups. They had glitzy headquarters and branded business cards. Their wealth underpinned Japan’s booming financial and real estate sectors; films, fanzines and tabloids glamorised their lifestyles and charitable largesse. And, at least on the face of it, they were bound by a strict code of conduct – no harassment of civilians, no dealing drugs – which was published on the walls of their headquarters. For the yakuza foot soldiers, discipline was brutal: a severed pinkie finger as punishment for insubordination. Evolving from trade unions in the post-war chaos of the 1940s, the yakuza held a precarious position in Japanese society. The public feared and looked down on these tattooed mobsters, whilst avidly following their exploits. And the authorities tolerated their presence – yakuza killings of rival gang members were rarely investigated, and the police would inform them of upcoming raids so “evidence” could be neatly boxed up and ready for the press call. “The Japanese have a schizophrenic attitude to them,” Adelstein notes. “They would like to believe there’s these people outside the system who are working for the greater good. But essentially most of them are sociopaths.” This sense of outsiderdom helped Adelstein gain their trust. “Nearly half of them are Korean-Japanese – they’re like the Jews of Japan!” he says with a laugh. That is, until he dug too deep on one investigation. In 2004, following evidence that a high-profile loan shark had laundered millions of dollars in Las Vegas casinos, he uncovered an odd trial: yakuza bosses had been travelling to the US, under the radar of the FBI, to have liver transplants. (In the hard-boozing world of the yakuza, a knackered liver is a badge of honour.) One of these bosses was Goto Tadamasa. After Adelstein published his story on this connection, Goto was kicked out of the Yamaguchi-gumi. Linked to the murder of a real-estate agent, he fled to Cambodia and became a Buddhist priest – a surprisingly common second career for ex-yakuza in a country where the statute of limitations for crimes is only five years. As well as threatening Adelstein, Goto published his own account of the affair. Adelstein asked him to retract passages about him, but stopped when Adelstein's lawyer – the famed prosecutor Igari Toshiro – was found dead in the Philippines. Toshiro and Adelstein’s work, though, helped galvanise Japan’s parliament to pass rigorous anti-yakuza laws. Goto is now back in Japan, and is trying to produce an English-language account of his biography. Yet Adelstein no longer believes he is a threat. His ex-yakuza bodyguard died of a heart attack during the pandemic. And he hasn’t hired another one. “Most yakuza are in their fifties now,” says Adelstein. “It’s a dead-end job, and it’s very hard to leave. There is no future for them. They’ll never again have the same power.” In fact, the unique atmosphere of Tokyo Vice has largely been scrubbed clean. Tokyo’s red-light districts have been gentrified, and the yakuza’s hold on the city has been cracked. Tokyo Vice feels valedictory – there’s an undertow of melancholy, mourning even, to Adelstein’s prose. He burned his youth, health and, eventually his marriage, for the job. And in 2011, he himself was diagnosed with liver cancer. (He made a full recovery.) He quit the Yomiuri in 2006. The last straw was a particularly nasty human trafficking case. Afterwards, he worked for the US State Department trying to combat the trade and published three other books alongside Tokyo Vice. Reading his own words now, feels like “printed PTSD,” he reflects. “There’s a lot of youthful idealism in there. But also a huge amount of pain and loss. It’s a terrifying thing to know someone wants you dead. People I’ve known have gone missing, colleagues have been beaten so badly they could barely walk.” Perhaps most painfully, though, Tokyo Vice recounts how Adelstein’s close friend and mentor, Hamaya, died by suicide. One of the paper’s few female senior reporters, she was demoted after she annoyed editors for championing the rights of the mentally-ill. It was a blow she couldn’t weather. Her loss still weighs on Adelstein. Living now, he writes in the book, involves always “thinking about the friends that you suspect you might be able to save”. There have been more recent difficulties. Since the adaptation was released in the US, some articles have questioned Tokyo Vice’s credibility. One interviewee quoted in The Hollywood Reporter said: “I don’t think half the stuff in the book happened.” In response, Adelstein dumped a series of documents purportedly verifying its claims on Twitter. And he’s bullish about the criticism when I speak to him. “I really wish they had taken the time to do the research,” he says. “It wouldn’t be hard to verify it – it’s all here. I’ve got a whole folder here [hefting a weighty black ring-binder into shot] which proves it. Most of it is in Japanese, but the lack of really basic research baffles me.” Come what may, he hasn’t slowed down. As a freelance reporter, he has published exposes into Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the links between former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and organised crime. He wrote about the LDP's cover-ups of Japan’s ageing nuclear infrastructure, and its contribution to the 2011 Fukushima reactor disaster, as well as how yakuza money was integral to Japan’s bid for the Olympics. “You have to remember Abe’s grandpappy was a yakuza,” he explains. “I seriously think the LDP has done more damage to this country than the yakuza.” A follow-up to Tokyo Vice is due out next year. And he is working on a podcast series about missing people. Would he ever consider retiring? “Sometimes, I think I might give it up and lead a life as a humble Zen Buddhist priest,” he laughs. “But I believe in life, we only encounter the injustices we’re meant to correct. You can only fight lies with truth.” He pauses, then grins. “It doesn’t feel like work – it feels like a calling.” Tokyo Vice is on Starz Play now.

5/19/2022,"A viral video of a Texas student choking an Indian American peer has sparked a petition against the aggressor.

In a video circulating online, Shaan Pritmani can be seen being assaulted and choked by a white student in the cafeteria of Coppell Middle School in Texas on May 11.

The video begins with the aggressor choking Shaan with his right arm before demanding him to stand up from his seat.

“No, I’m not getting up,” Shaan replies. “There is literally no one sitting here.”

The student then presses his elbow on Shaan’s neck from behind before choking him once again while dragging him away from the seat. Other students surrounding the two can be heard cheering.

 
 
 On Wednesday, May 11th, during lunch, Shaan Pritmani was physically attacked and choked by another student at his middle school.

Shaan’s parents were contacted by the school and informed that their son had been involved in an altercation with another student. The school allegedly found Shaan to be at fault. He received a 3-day in-school suspension as punishment, while the aggressor only received one day.

When his parents requested for a reassessment using the viral video as evidence, the school said that there will be no changes made. The School Resource Officer refused to file a citation because the school administration allegedly asked that the incident not be documented as there have already been many bullying complaints.

“Coppell ISD is aware of a video circulating on social media showing an incident at Coppell Middle School North involving a physical altercation between two students,” Coppell School Superintendent Dr. Brad Hunt wrote in an email. “Bullying, both verbal and physical, as well as physical acts of aggression are never acceptable and do not align with who we are at CISD and our core values.”

Sonika Kukreja, Shaan’s mother, started a petition on Change.org to spread awareness and to call on the school to take more action against her son’s aggressor. The petition has since gathered nearly 244,000 signatures, as of this writing. It will become one of the top petitions on Change.org if it reaches 300,000 signatures.

“Due to lack of support from the Coppell ISD and Coppell PD to correctly handle this assault, we are demanding that the aggressor be removed from my son's school immediately,” Kukreja wrote. “Shaan should never have to take a class, interact, or pass the hallways with this aggressor ever again. Shaan should be able to continue his school experience, friendships and extra-curricular activities with zero worry of ever having to cross paths with this student again. He does not feel safe.”

“Our goal is to bring awareness to the bullying and assault problem in schools everywhere,” she added. “All children deserve to be safe at school. Serious repercussions need to be in place for all violence against our children. This type of aggression needs to stop!”

Shaan’s parents have reportedly sought legal representation while awaiting the conclusion of the school’s internal investigation.

5/19/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) -Russia on Wednesday said it was using a new generation of powerful laser weapons in Ukraine to burn up drones, deploying some of Moscow's secret weapons to counter a flood of Western arms supplied to its former Soviet neighbour. President Vladimir Putin in 2018 unveiled an array of new weapons including a new intercontinental ballistic missile, underwater nuclear drones, a supersonic weapon and a new laser weapon. Little is known about the specifics of the new laser weapons. Putin mentioned one called Peresvet, named after a medieval Orthodox warrior monk Alexander Peresvet who perished in mortal combat. Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told a conference in Moscow that Peresvet was already being widely deployed and it could blind satellites up to 1,500 km above Earth. He said, though, that there were already more powerful Russian systems than Peresvet that could burn up drones and other equipment. Borisov cited a test on Tuesday which he said had burned up a drone 5 km away within five seconds. ""If Peresvet blinds, then the new generation of laser weapons lead to the physical destruction of the target - thermal destruction, they burn up,"" Borisov told Russian state television. Asked if such weapons were being used in Ukraine, Borisov said: ""Yes. The first prototypes are already being used there."" He said the weapon was called ""Zadira"". Almost nothing is publicly known about Zadira but in 2017 Russian media said Russia's state nuclear corporation, Rosatom, helped develop it as part of a programme to create weapons-based new physical principles, known by the Russian acronym ONFP. Putin's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has illustrated the limits of Russia's post-Soviet conventional armed forces, though he says the ""special military operation"" is going to plan and will achieve all of Moscow's aims. The United States has ruled out sending its own or NATO forces to Ukraine but Washington and its allies have supplied billions of dollars of weapons to Kyiv such as drones, Howitzer heavy artillery, anti-aircraft Stinger and anti-tank Javelin missiles. Putin casts such large arms shipments as part of a broader plan by the United States to destroy Russia - and has promised that it will never succeed. Borisov's remarks indicate that Russia has made significant progress with laser weapons, a trend of considerable interest to other nuclear powers such as the United States and China. Using lasers to blind satellites - or even burn them up - was once a fantasy from the realm of science fiction, but major powers such as the United States, China and Russia have been working on variants of such weapons for years. Besides the benefits in conventional warfare of burning up drones, blinding reconnaissance systems has a strategic impact too as satellites are used to monitor intercontinental ballistic missiles which carry nuclear weapons. Borisov said he had just returned from Sarov, a closed town in the Nizhny Novgorod region once known as Arzamas-16 because it was so secret, which is a centre of Russia's nuclear weapons research. He said a new generation of laser weapons using a wide electromagnetic band would ultimately replace conventional weapons. ""This is not some sort of exotic idea; it is the reality,"" Borisov said.

5/19/2022,"President Vladimir Putin has long tried to project an image of abundant good health. Ukrainian officials claimed in May that he is hiding that he is ""very ill"" with cancer. Rumors of health problems and secret surgery have followed the Russian president for decades. Speculation about President Vladimir Putin's health reached fever pitch on Sunday after former MI6 Russia spy Christopher Steele indicated the Russian president could be seriously ill. Speaking to Sky News, Steele said Putin's health could be a factor in the unfolding invasion of Ukraine. Since invading Ukraine Putin has had shaky media appearances and has been described — with varying reliability — as suffering from everything from Parkinson's disease to dementia. Putin has for decades cultivated an image of virile masculinity at peak fitness — but an investigation by independent Russian media outlet Proekt alleged that this was only possible with significant deception. Most specifics about Putin's health are almost impossible to confirm. His top spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has repeatedly denied any issues. Medical professionals have refused to give weight to the rumors, as Deutsche Welle reported, arguing that accurate diagnoses can only be made by in-person examinations. Here is a timeline of moments when Putin's health has come into question. In fall 2012, Reuters cited three government sources saying Putin had back trouble and would need surgery soon. The Kremlin denied this, but after Russian newspaper Vedomosti said that Putin had hurt himself while hang-gliding, Peskov said the trouble was due to ""an ordinary sporting injury"" in which Putin had strained a muscle, as The Atlantic reported. By the end of December 2012, Proekt alleged that Putin was wearing a corset and significantly limiting — or even skipping — sit-down engagements due to likely back problems. The outlet cited unnamed Russian officials for the information. On November 4, Russia's National Unity Day, the Kremlin limited itself to still photos of Putin's appearance at a ceremony in Red Square, according to Proekt. However, footage posted by religious leaders in Moscow showed the president with a slight limp. By matching the check-in dates of medical specialists with Putin's travel schedule, Proekt found that Putin was regularly accompanied by at least five doctors in these years — a number that would later swell to 13. They included an ENT specialist, an infectious diseases specialist, a staff rescuscitologist, and a neurosurgeon, the outlet reported. Between November 25 and December 1, Putin appeared only in pre-recorded meetings, Proekt reported. Meanwhile, 12 specialists suddenly checked in at the Sochi hospital near his residence, including his personal doctors, neurosurgeons, and a rehabilitation specialist, according to Proekt. Putin, an avid ice hockey player, almost somersaulted when he crashed to the ground during a match in Sochi at the age of 64, CNN reported. According to Proekt, the player Pavel Bure had crashed into him. After this, an orthopedic traumatologist known to regularly treat the president checked in to a hospital just outside Putin's residence, Proekt reported. Between August 8 and 16 that year, the president disappeared from public view, with oncologist-surgeon Evgeny Selivanov, Proekt reported. The presence of an ENT doctor suggested a thyroid issue, the outlet said. Selivanov joined Putin's medical entourage, flying to his location 35 times in the space of four years, the outlet reported. Only ENT doctors have seen him more often, the outlet said. Putin disappeared from view from February 12 to 1 in 2018, just one month before polling day, Proekt reported. Acknowledging his canceled events, Peskov said Putin has a cold, per ABC News. A COVID-19 outbreak among presidential staff in September last year led Putin to self-isolate for two weeks. Ten days later, he denied any ill health after he was seen coughing during a televised meeting. Soon after, The New York Times reported that Putin was imposing increasingly stringent isolation procedures on anyone due to see him face-to-face — including isolation for two weeks prior and the requirement to pass through a disinfectant tunnel. This came weeks after Russia lifted most of its COVID-19 measures nationwide, the paper reported. By February 2022 — as world leaders implored him not to invade Ukraine — Putin was having his in-person meetings at an extraordinarily long table. Bizarre footage of Putin meeting with his defense minister on April 21 showed the president gripping the edge of the table, looking uncomfortable and fidgety, as Newsweek reported. Along with his bloated appearance, the video prompted a welter of tabloid speculation — none of which was confirmed — that he could be suffering from the effects of steroid treatment or Parkinson's disease. —max seddon (@maxseddon) April 21, 2022 Further unverified rumors were emanated from an anonymous Telegram account claiming to be a former Kremlin insider. In early May, New Lines Magazine obtained a recording of an unnamed Russian oligarch saying that Putin ""is very ill with blood cancer."" The oligarch, who did not know he was being recorded, went on to criticize Putin's invasion of Ukraine, saying that ""we all hope"" he dies, and that ""the problem is with his head."" Ukrainian intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told Sky News on May 14 that plans to overthrow Putin were in motion within Russia, and that the 69-year-old was in a ""very bad psychological and physical condition and he is very sick."" Putin is sick with cancer, Budanov said. He denied trying to propagate that idea or propaganda to advantage Ukraine.

5/19/2022,"By Tom Balmforth and Jonathan Landay KYIV/KHARKIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Even as the Kremlin prepares to take full control of the ruins of Mariupol city, it faces the growing prospect of defeat in its bid to conquer all of Ukraine's eastern Donbas because its badly mauled forces lack the manpower for significant advances. Russian President Vladimir Putin may have to decide whether to send in more troops and hardware to replenish his dramatically weakened invasion force as an influx of modern Western weaponry bolsters Ukraine's combat power, analysts say. Russia's forces are unlikely to be vanquished quickly even if no major new troop deployment materialises, setting the stage for the four-week-old Battle for the Donbas to grind on. ""I think it's either going to be defeat with the current force posture, or mobilise. I don't think there is any middle ground,"" said Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy. He and other analysts said Russia's invasion force was facing unsustainable troop and equipment losses, and that their window for a breakthrough was narrowing with Ukraine now bringing Western heavy artillery into the fray. ""Time is definitely working against the Russians. They're running out of equipment. They're running out of particularly advanced missiles. And, of course, the Ukrainians are getting stronger almost every day,"" said Neil Melvin of the RUSI think-tank in London. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that ""everything is going to plan ... there's no doubt that all the objectives will be achieved,"" the RIA news agency reported. But in an unusually critical commentary on Russia's main television channel this week, a prominent military analyst said Russians should stop swallowing ""informational tranquilizers"" about what Putin calls a special military operation. With the increasing flow of U.S. and European weapon supplies to Ukrainian forces, ""the situation will frankly get worse for us,"" said Mikhail Khodaryonok, a retired colonel. AZOVSTAL FALLS Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in a failed drive to capture the capital, Kyiv. It then withdrew to focus on a ""second phase"" announced on April 19 to capture the south and all of the Donbas, a chunk of which has been held by Moscow-backed separatists since 2014. Russia retained its land corridor in southern Ukraine, but was hampered by Ukrainian troops who held out against massive bombardments for 82 days in Mariupol's Azovstal steel works before ending their resistance this week. Meanwhile, Putin's forces pressed against Ukraine's battle-hardened, fortified positions in the east, while trying to cut them off in a massive encirclement by advancing south from the Ukrainian town of Izium. Around a third of the Donbas was held by Russia-backed separatists before the invasion. Moscow now controls around 90% of Luhansk region, but it has failed to make major inroads towards the key cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk in Donetsk in order to extend control over the entire region. ""I'm deeply skeptical of their prospects"" of conquering all of the Donbas, said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military with CNA, a U.S. nonprofit research and analysis organisation. ""They're dealing with a dramatically weakened force, probably substantially reduced morale. There's a weak desire by officers to keep trying to prosecute offensives and the Russian political leadership on the whole seems to be procrastinating even as it's facing the strategic defeat itself,"" he said. Muzyka said Russia appeared to be switching its focus in Donbas and had shifted battalion tactical groups eastward after failing to break the Ukrainian defences in Donetsk. ""They couldn't push through from Izium so they moved to Sievierodonetsk and Lyman, possibly with the goal of trying to encircle Ukrainian forces around Sievierodonetsk and Lyman. Whether or not this occurs is an entirely different matter,"" he said. Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the Russian chief of army staff, visited the front this month in an apparent bid to iron out problems, but there is no evidence he succeeded, said Jack Keane, the chairman of the Institute for the Study of War in Washington. ""That offensive has indeed stalled,"" he said. To the north of the Donbas, Kyiv has mounted a counter-offensive near the city of Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine that has cleared Russian forces from shelling range of the country's second biggest city and even reached the border in one place. Muzyka said Ukraine might secure a significant part of its border with Russia north of Kharkiv this week. But Ukraine will not be able to replicate that quick advance in the Donbas where Russia's troops are much more densely concentrated. ""It's going to be a hard fight. There's going to be a hard fight and potentially a long fight. The Russian military hasn’t done well on the offensive, but it doesn't rout or surrender easily either,"" said Kofman. 'ARTILLERY WAR' The influx of Western heavy guns, including scores of U.S. - and some Canadian - M777 howitzers that have longer range than their Russian equivalents, could give Ukraine an edge in a war that has revolved around artillery duels. ""The Ukrainians are starting to outrange the Russians. That means they are able to operate without the threat of counter-battery fire from the Russians,"" said Muzyka. ""Don't get me wrong, the Russians still enjoy overall artillery superiority in terms of numbers, but I'm not sure if the same goes for the quality now... This is an artillery war."" Muzyka and Kofman said that even if Putin does send more troops, such a move could take months to organise. ""It's very clear they're preparing for at least some kind of measures to call up men with prior service experience. But right now, from what I can tell, Putin is just kicking the can down the road and letting the situation within the Russian military actually get worse,"" Kofman said. ""For now,"" he said, ""this is looking like the Russians' last offensive.""

5/19/2022,"“Mommy, help me,” 9-year-old Shalom Guifarro begged as she lay dying in her family’s Brooklyn apartment, after enduring hours of abuse — allegedly at the hands of the same person the child wished would save her. The heartbreaking details of the little girl’s final hours were detailed by prosecutors at her mother Shemene Cato’s arraignment in Brooklyn Criminal Court Tuesday, where she was ordered held without bail. Cato, 48, is charged with murder, manslaughter, assault and other crimes in her youngest daughter’s death over a missing tablet Sunday morning. Little Shalom was hiding from her infuriated mother, who spent two hours walloping her and her 13-year-old sister with an extension cord and bashing them with a broom inside their Lincoln Place apartment, prosecutors said. But the spot Shalom sought as a safe haven from her maniacal mother turned out to be the opposite. “The defendant lifted up the bed, attempting to pull the child out from underneath,” said Assistant District Attorney David Ingle in court. “The bed dropped on Shalom... The bed fell onto her head.” After Cato dropped the bed on her daughter, the child was still, prosecutors said. “Shalom could not stand up, was non-responsive and kept saying, ‘Mommy, help me,’” said Ingle. Finally, around 1 p.m. Shalom’s older sister called police. Shalom suffered multiple blunt force injuries to her head and body, and bled to death internally, the city Medical Examiners Office said. Cato shuffled into court Tuesday in pajama bottoms and pink flip flops and remained silent, fidgeting with her hands cuffed behind her back. The accused monster mom showed little emotion other than hanging her head low throughout the proceedings. The killing shocked members of the Crown Heights community, who regularly saw Cato and her two daughters out and about. Rev. Pedro Torres, who runs No Longer Bound Ministries just around the corner from the apartment, said he saw them almost every day and never noticed anything out of the ordinary. “She [Cato] was regular. She would have a conversation, we would talk,” Torres said, recalling that she asked him how she could improve her credit. “Everybody says she was always verbally abusive with the child. I never saw that. I always saw her with the child like a mom, taking care of her kids,” Torres said. He remembers a playful, happy, Shalom running around — a child he once gifted with a doll on Christmas. “She really had no worries in the world. Always smiling and funny,” he said. “I remember the time when I gave her the doll. The next day she saw me and she gave me a hug. She was very appreciative,” he said.",U.S./NY Daily News,"9-year-old Brooklyn girl cried ‘Mommy, help me,’ as she died after hours of beatings and abuse: prosecutors",https://news.yahoo.com/9-old-brooklyn-girl-cried-233900085.html

5/19/2022,"Surveillance footage from China showed an 8-year-old boy violently stomping on the head of a 2-year-old girl to steal the snacks she was carrying.

On May 5, the boy, named Zhuang, entered the toddler’s home in Haikou where she was playing alone, according to a Weibo post from Owl Video. He allegedly demanded that the toddler hand over her snacks, but when she refused, he began to beat her.

In the surveillance footage, the boy is seen kicking the 2-year-old to the ground before violently stomping on her head. He attempts to stomp on the toddler again as she tries to stand up, but he runs away after the girl’s grandfather yells out.

The toddler suffered head trauma and four loose teeth which required two months of treatment.

Zhuang’s parents initially denied their son’s involvement in the attack until they saw the surveillance footage. When the toddler’s parents confronted the boy, he responded, “I beat whenever I want.”

In an open letter at the end of the Weibo video, the 2-year-old’s mother stated that their family has never had issues with Zhuang’s family. They reportedly refused to apologize or express any remorse. Zhuang’s parents also allegedly said they cannot afford compensation and begged the toddler’s family not to report the attack to the police.

The toddler’s parents reported the attack to the police after Zhuang’s parents continued not to apologize. The case is now under investigation.

Weibo users criticized Chinese juvenile crime laws, with some suggesting that the boy may have antisocial personality disorder.

“I feel like it was an attempted murder. If someone hadn't shouted when he kicked her like this, he would have kicked her to death. After all, 2-year-olds are still very fragile,” one user wrote.

“Beating a 2-year-old child like this for bad reasons? This kind of person feels that sooner or later he will commit a crime, and it is recommended that he be locked up in a children's correctional center, and he will be released after he has been educated,” another user commented.

5/19/2022,"A 17-year-old Boston high school student suffered a stroke while in class but did not receive the medical assistance he needed after officials called his mother instead of 911. The teen’s mother, who is wheelchair-bound, is furious, asking why the school nurse did not recognize the signs of his health failing when the boy complained about feeling tired and his side felt numb. D’Andre Hicks, a junior at the Henderson Inclusion (Upper School) in Dorchester, Mass, became ill while under the school’s supervision in early May 2022. After telling his school nurse he felt “weak,” “shaky,” and “numb,” she called his mother Alishia Hicks to pick him up from the school, ignoring the signs suggesting the boy was having a stroke and the mother’s request to get more immediate assistance for her child. “He came to the nurse’s office to report that he was feeling weak, shaky and that he felt numb weakness on his left side,” the mother said. She recalled telling her nurse, “He’s going to die if he’s stroking, they’re taking too long to dial 911.” Alishia argues the school’s top medical professional should have considered first responders who would have gotten to the boy first, noting her proximity to the school and inability to move fast because she is confined to a wheelchair. Instead, the nurse told the mom, “Well, my professional, my medical evaluation, it doesn’t look like he needs an ambulance, somebody should come pick him up.” Eventually, the school called 911, who arrived 30-45 minutes after the initial call to the mother — despite the teen remaining in crisis. The call was made after the school reached out to the Department of Children and Families because the mom didn’t come immediately. “You could hear the other one in the background,” Alishia recalled. “The other nurse said to call DCF.” Once an ambulance showed up, the young man was taken to Tufts Medical Center where he was diagnosed as having an acute ischemic stroke. The doctors stopped the stroke using medication but kept the child for two days. The mother knew it all along, saying, “Even I know the symptoms of a stroke. Why didn’t the nurse?” Boston 25 News reports Alishia, herself, has had three strokes in her life. She further explained her family has a history of strokes. “Listen there’s a small vessel problem on my mother’s side of the family that causes a stroke easily if there’s any blockage in it is so important to get him to the hospital right away because he could die,” she shared. “Your professional eye may not see the stroke,” Alishia said as she tried to communicate. “It’s not visible but if he’s telling you he is weak on his left side, please, at this point I’m pleading with all intensity that I could muster up with no voice. Please get my son to the hospital, please.” D’Andre said, “They start arguing with her on that while I’m out here stroking on the bed right now trying to stay up. I was afraid that if I fell asleep or something like that I was going to go into a coma or probably for the worst.” His mother says, “He’s not happy about the school right now he doesn’t feel safe there. His words when he was in the hospital, he said ‘Mom I can’t believe they didn’t believe me.’” Boston School Superintendent Brenda Cassellius personally reached out to the mother to apologize; Alishia shared. Cassellius told her the district is already reviewing the incident. In a statement released by the Boston Public Schools, officials wanted to make clear their first concern is “first with the health and well-being of this student.” “We are glad to hear he is recovering well,” it continued in part. “This serious incident is being reviewed by appropriate BPS staff and therefore it would be inappropriate to comment further on this specific matter.” While the mother acknowledged the Superintendent’s outreach, she could not help but think race played a part in the school’s response. Her thoughts about race and medical care are in line with a recent study put out by the American Bar Association about “Implicit Bias and Racial Disparities in Health Care.” They claim, “Black people simply are not receiving the same quality of health care that their white counterparts receive.” Her son is evidence of this. The school also released a statement to the student body’s families informing them about the paramedics coming to the campus. Instead of referencing D’Andre’s plight, they shared with the parents that paramedics were called to support a student having a diabetic episode. Neither the school nor DCF released a public statement, but have confirmed the Hicks incident is being investigated.

5/19/2022,"A TikToker is going viral after sharing how Airbnb arbitrage properties changed her life. The post comes from The KarWells (@thekarwells), two friends who run a successful real estate business and a TikTok page full of investing tips. In one of the page’s most popular clips, Sarah Glidewell, one half of The KarWells, recently explained how she went from making $50,000 per year to over $100,000 from Airbnb rental properties. Bitcoin ETFs: What are they and how to invest in them? Her clip is just the latest in a recent trend of TikTokers embracing financial transparency on the app. In one video, a business owner detailed how she pays all of her employees — including herself — the same salary. In another, a Google employee shared how he went from having a 1.2 GPA in college to making $344,000 a year. Glidewell’s financial situation, she explained, came largely from Airbnb arbitrage properties. Typically, Airbnb hosts own the properties they rent through the vacation app. However, Airbnb arbitrage is the process of renting a property and subletting it to Airbnb guests. The process can be difficult to pull off due to legal restrictions and issues with landlords, but, as Glidewell shared, it can also be very profitable. In her clip, Glidewell explained how she was making $50,000 at her day job in 2019. Despite people encouraging her to save up for a new car, she managed to put away $20,000 to invest in her business idea instead. She used that money to start renting and furnishing four different properties, which she then listed on Airbnb. Less than three years later, she’s making between $7,000 and $15,000 per month in profit. “Had I listened to everyone else,” she said. “I’d have a two and a half-year-old vehicle, I’d still be at a nine-to-five. … All I’m saying is, stop trading what you really want for what you want right now.” Check out our men's beach and swimwear summer style guide: The business model clearly transformed Glidewell’s financial situation — The KarWells’ TikTok bio says, “Airbnb changed our lives” — but, it also left TikTokers with plenty of questions. Specifically, commenters wanted to know how, and under what circumstances, arbitrage is legal. There are local and state laws that disallow sub-leasing, as well as some places where pricing may make it difficult. Additionally, many leases forbid rental arbitrage. As Glidewell explained in the video’s comments, she had to call and negotiate with landlords directly in order to strike a deal where she could re-lease her rental. As with many recent financial stories on the app, TikTokers praised Glidewell for the insight. “Saving 40% of your salary is very impressive! Congratulations,” one user wrote. “Such a great example of true investing,” another added.

The Fox News host blasted Democratic efforts to restrict hate speech that incites the kind of violence perpetrated by the white suspected gunman who left a racist online manifesto before his attack on a supermarket. She pointed to a Rolling Stone headline that read, “The Buffalo Shooter Isn’t A ‘Lone Wolf.’ He’s A Mainstream Republican.” The article explained how the accused killer embraced “the great replacement theory” that has become more common among conservatives (including Tucker Carlson at Fox News and top House Republican Elise Stefanik) and took the propaganda to its violently “logical conclusion.” “The gonzo journalists at Rolling Stone say no, no, no, no, no, there are accomplices here: The Republicans,” Ingraham said indignantly. “It’s so weak, I don’t even want to talk about it tonight because it’s so predictable.

5/19/2022,"Can you put a dollar amount on what it means to be wealthy in the U.S.? An annual survey asks Americans to do just that, and this year, $2.2 million is the magic number. That's according to the annual Modern Wealth Survey from Charles Schwab, which also finds people believe that an average net worth of $774,000 is what it takes to be financially comfortable. The report, which surveyed 1,000 Americans ages 21 to 75 in February 2022, asked respondents a range of questions about their personal finances, including the factors influencing their savings and investment decisions. The average net worth needed to be considered wealthy and to be financially comfortable both rose from last year's survey. In 2021, Americans said they needed $624,000 in net assets to live comfortably, while it would take $1.9 million to be rich. That said, the averages are still lower than they were before the COVID-19 pandemic, likely because many people are focusing less on hitting a specific number and more on their overall goals, financial and otherwise, says Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning, retirement income, and wealth management at Charles Schwab. ""People are concerned about other things besides the balance in their portfolio and in their investment account,"" says Williams, including their physical health and overall stability. The average net worth of U.S. households actually isn't so far off from Schwab's survey: It stood at $748,800 in 2019, according to the most recent Survey of Consumer Finances by the Federal Reserve. But that's skewed by the richest households. The median net worth for U.S. households is $121,700, per the Fed. And as other reports have found, many U.S. households have very little or no savings at all. With little saved for emergencies or retirement, a number like $2.2 million—or even $774,000—might seem like an impossible benchmark to reach. But Williams says this doesn't have to be the case. Ultimately, each household should calculate its own wealth target and make an individualized savings plan. What one person or family needs isn't the same as another. “A plan is really just saying, ‘This is what’s important to me, this is what I need to save and invest for next year, in five years, 10 years from now,’” says Williams. Once you have some idea of a target, the most important thing you can do is start saving—regardless of the amount you put away. Five dollars is better than nothing, even if it doesn't seem at first like it will add up to much. Putting even a little bit of money away consistently is especially important when building a retirement account, as most Americans will be on their own to fund their golden years, says Williams. ""No matter how much money you have, get started and stay disciplined,"" he says. ""You’ll look back and say, ‘Goodness, those small steps really built up over time.’ You’ll find yourself in a position where you can make a lot more choices than you could before."" Once you start saving, make it an automatic ritual. Oftentimes, watching your savings accrue will provide the momentum to keep saving more and more, even if you're just starting out or well below your target number, says Williams. Keeping the long game in mind is critical, especially in a rocky market like we're seeing right now. Building wealth, for most people, takes decades of dedicated investments. Though investing money in assets that are on a losing streak can seem self-defeating, a down market is ""an opportunity to be saving and investing more,"" says Williams—and getting more for your money. ""If you’re investing for net worth, it takes time to get there,"" he says. ""It's good to be aspirational, but get started and don’t get overwhelmed by trying to get to a certain number in a day or a week.""

5/19/2022,"By Josh Smith and Hyonhee Shin SEOUL (Reuters) - Despite battling a wave of suspected COVID-19 infections, North Korea appears to be preparing to test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) ahead of U.S. President Joe Biden's first trip to South Korea, South Korean and U.S. officials said. An ICBM test appeared imminent, Deputy National Security Adviser Kim Tae-hyo told a briefing in Seoul. ""If there is a small or large North Korean provocation during the summit period, we have prepared Plan B,"" he said. That plan would secure the combined U.S. and South Korea military forces' defence posture and command and control systems, even if it requires changing the summit schedule, Kim said. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the latest intelligence showed North Korea could carry out an ICBM test as soon as Thursday or Friday. Biden is expected to arrive in South Korea on Friday and hold talks with his South Korean counterparts over several days before visiting Japan. The White House said last week Biden was considering a trip to the Demilitarized Zone on the border with North Korea, but Kim said that seemed unlikely. A weapons test could overshadow Biden's broader focus on China, trade, and other regional issues, and underscore the lack of progress in denuclearisation talks despite his administration's vow to break the stalemate with practical approaches. It could also complicate international efforts to offer Pyongyang aid as it battles its first confirmed COVID outbreak. The trip is Biden's first to the region as president, and will be the first summit with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, who took office on May 10. Yoon has vowed to take a harder line against North Korean ""provocations,"" and is expected to seek greater assurances from Biden that the United States will strengthen its ""extended deterrence"" against the North. The Yoon administration has asked the United States to station more nuclear-capable ""strategic assets"" such as long-range bombers, submarines, and aircraft carriers in the region. The chances of North Korea conducting a nuclear test this weekend appear low, but if the North stages any major provocation, such assets are ready to be mobilised, Kim said. U.S. officials had warned that the North could test a nuclear weapon around the visit, and the State Department said on Tuesday there is no expectation that the COVID outbreak would change Pyongyang's determination to eventually resume nuclear testing, paused since 2017. ""Even as (North Korea) continues to refuse the donation of ... apparently much-needed COVID vaccines, they continue to invest untold sums in ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes that do nothing to alleviate the humanitarian plight of the North Korean people,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price told a briefing. A new report by the U.S.-based Center for International and Strategic Studies (CSIS) said commercial satellite imagery shows work continuing at the nuclear site, whose underground testing tunnels were shuttered in 2018 after leader Kim Jong Un declared a moratorium on nuclear and ICBM tests. He has since said that the country is no longer bound by that moratorium because of a lack of progress in talks with the United States. The North resumed testing ICBMs in March. ""The timing of this test rests solely within the hands of Kim Jong Un,"" the CSIS report on the nuclear site said. North Korea has also resumed construction at a long-dormant nuclear reactor that would increase its production of plutonium for nuclear weapons by a factor of 10, researchers at the U.S.-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) reported last week, citing satellite imagery. Analysts say that even if North Korea tests a weapon, South Korea and the United States should offer unconditional COVID aid. North Korea sent aircraft to China to pick up medical supplies days after it confirmed its first COVID-19 outbreak, media reported on Tuesday, but Pyongyang has yet to respond to offers of aid from South Korea. Washington says that it supports providing assistance to North Korea, but that there were no current plans to provide vaccines.

5/19/2022,"Countries around the world have rushed to aid Ukraine since Russia's attack began on February 24. Veterans from those countries' militaries have also gone to Ukraine to help train Ukrainian forces. Andy Milburn, a 31-year US Marine Corps veteran, is in Ukraine leading one of those training efforts. As Russia's war in Ukraine nears the three-month mark, Moscow has failed to achieve any of its primary objectives. Russian forces have suffered humiliating defeats and taken high casualties and are now focusing their efforts on a much smaller part of eastern Ukraine. Patron is a tiny but mighty hero, helping to sniff out and defuse undetonated bombs alongside a pyrotechnic team in northern Ukraine. Since Russia's invasion began on February 24, the US and other countries have sent billions in military, economic, and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Foreigners have also raced to Ukraine to help the Ukrainian military. One of the most notable of these efforts is that of the Mozart Group, which is composed mainly of special-operations veterans and is led by Andy Milburn, who retired in 2019 after 31 years in the US Marine Corps. Milburn was a Marine Raider who served as the deputy commander of US Special Operations Command Central and was the first Marine to lead a special-operations task force in the fight against the ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Mozart Group members are already on the ground in Ukraine and the group is looking for additional members and funds to support its operations there. Mozart Group is in Ukraine for two main reasons: to increase the Ukrainian military's capability and sustainable capacity in a manner consistent with US foreign policy and to protect vulnerable civilians. It's important to highlight that Mozart Group members aren't directly involved in the fighting — they've seen action, but only in self-defense — and their actions in Ukraine fully comply with the US Neutrality Act, which prohibits Americans from joining foreign militaries or launching their own wars against countries the US isn't at war with. In a written interview, Milburn told Insider what he's seen in Ukraine, how his group is training Ukrainians, and how the war there compares to his experiences in the US military. They needed basic skills, from weapons-handling to zeroing their weapons and marksmanship to squad movement. Although many had seen combat already, it was very much a ""come-as-you-are party,"" with the Territorial Defense and even [Ukrainian special-operations force] units rushing personnel to the fight with little to no training. Medical training has always been critically important. They have a medic-to-soldier ration and their basic medical skills are below those of their British and US counterparts. There has been no real change in their needs because attrition levels mean that they are constantly dealing with a significant number of new soldiers. Also the skills that we teach are perishable — and you don't always get to practice them on the line. We have added breadth and depth to our training, however, since we now have a little more time and have brought in specialists to teach drones and [anti-tank guided missiles]. Morale and resolve have been key components of success — but the terrain has been an important factor in enabling Ukrainian forces to hold their ground. In the north and urban regions, the Russian proclivity to remain on the roads has played against them. Outside the cities in the north, the ground is either thickly wooded or swampy, and this has allowed the defenders to infiltrate easily through Russian lines to strike armored columns from the flank. Russian units here have proven to be singularly unimpressive. Almost without exception, they are poorly trained, ill-disciplined, and lack cohesion. Their tactics belong to a bygone era — little understanding of combined arms and no infantry integration with their armored attacks. Their equipment is also poor — the T-72 [tanks] and BRDM [armored personnel carriers] are prone to erupt into flames upon impact from any high-explosive missile — and many of them appear to be wearing Soviet-era uniforms. After the Russian Army's poor showing in Georgia in 2008, Putin announced a series of supposedly sweeping reforms — but these, I am told, succumbed to corruption. Anyone with education, influence or money is able to escape military service, leaving what one Ukrainian who lived in Russian for 20 years called the dregs of society to fill the ranks of its army. It really doesn't compare. In the US military there is a tendency to overplay combat experience — and of course that term in itself is relative. I would argue that few in the US military have experienced the intensity of combat experienced by our Ukrainian counterparts. Perhaps the exception for me was the battle of Fallujah, but that is more because of my own childlike distaste for dark, closed spaces harboring people with ill-intent [that] frightened me more than anything that happened in the open. Shouldering an anti-tank weapon against a column of T-72s knowing that you are well within range of the enemy's weapons or sitting in the basement of a half-demolished house while Russian artillery pounds the ground above you waiting for the first Russian foot soldier to come down the steps so that you can kill him are experiences that few of us in the West have shared. And yet, the Ukrainians are mostly humble enough to realize that experiences like that don't by themselves make proficient soldiers. Many of the Ukrainian infantry thrown into the defense of Kyiv had to learn on the job. I spoke to one student who struggled to work the safety catch on his AK-47 (a pesky defect with that particular weapon), until his platoon commander simply handed him a bag of grenades and told him to use those instead. ""So much easier!"" exclaimed the novice soldier with a relief that was not intended to be ironic. The US military is ill-prepared for other reasons too — and these are cultural. The Ukrainian soldier understands the prominence of the ""kill chain"" in modern warfare, the need to establish sensing and shooting stand-off with your adversary, in a way that his US counterpart does not. I think that the US needs to embrace the probability of Ukrainian victory — and stop shuffle-stepping its support because of an exaggerated fear of escalation. US policy in this sense is incoherent — we are either providing lethal aid or not. That is the red line, not whether we have US contractors in country to oversee the distribution of logistics according to priorities or whether we provide the Ukrainians with long-range strike drones, as the Turks have done. It's really hard for me to say with certainty that we are — how does one prove such a thing? I can say that our efforts, although limited in scope, are having an intangible effect. Our Ukrainian partners appear to be delighted and possibly comforted to have us here — even though we do not represent the US government.

5/19/2022,"For 55-year-old Liang Shi, age is no limit as he took an entrance exam for the 26th time since he was a teenager to get into his dream school.

While many people have reportedly told Liang that his “failing memory” would hinder him from studying textbooks like his younger peers, he is determined to score high enough on the gaokao exam this year to attend Sichuan University, which he first missed out on in 1983.

He described himself as “still young” and reassured his critics that he has no issues with studying at his age.

“I just turned 55, and I’m still young. And I am having no trouble learning history and geography so far,” Liang said in a video posted to Weibo by Sino-Singapore.

The gaokao exam, which translates to “high exam,” is China’s annual standardized college entrance exam and is typically taken during the third and final year of high school. It is known for being notoriously difficult.

Liang had to skip the exam 14 times due to work and policies that required students to be unmarried and under the age of 25, which were later removed in 2001.

In June of last year, Liang received a score of 403 out of 750 while the minimum admission score to attend Sichuan University is 521. Despite failing for the 25th time, Liang persevered and began preparing for this year’s exam shortly after finishing last year’s as his “desire to attend college was strong.”

“I will continue to take the gaokao until it becomes obvious that my dream cannot be realized,” Liang said.

After failing the science portion of the exam for years, which is included for those who apply as science students, Liang decided to transfer as an art and human science student, as he believes it may be easier to prepare for.

Online users have nicknamed Liang as “gaokao Dingzihu,” which translates to “nail household,” in reference to people who never leave their home or give up despite numerous failures.

Liang currently owns a building materials company in Chengdu, the capital of southwest China’s Sichuan Province.

Similarly, in 2019, a 72-year-old Chinese man, Kang Lianxi, took the gaokao for the last time after failing it 19 times. Despite not receiving the score that he hoped for, Kang's determination motivated some young students to believe that it is never too late to achieve objectives and life goals.

5/19/2022,"Apparently, we’ve all been using sticky notes completely wrong, according to one TikToker at least. How to avoid panic buying in an ultra-competitive housing market There’s nothing more disappointing than whipping out a Post-it note for an important reminder, only for it to unstick from the surface and get lost. Apparently, however, this isn’t a matter of product malfunction so much as it is one of user error. TikToker Ali Abdaal recently learned the correct way to use a Post-it note and shared how in a quick video. Watch this Brooklyn bedroom go from drab to fabulous in one day: “I was today years old when I realized I’ve been using Post-its all wrong,” Abdaal wrote in the caption. “You’re probably using Post-it notes wrong,” he explained in the video. Here’s how you use them properly. Normally we rip off Post-it notes like this. But the problem is that it naturally wants to unstick itself.” Instead, he suggested, placing the Post-it note pad sideways and pulling the note off that way. “Then it sticks properly,” he said. Because the note isn’t bent upward, it’s less likely to peel off and unstick. The useful tip racked up over 300,000 views on TikTok. “Are we just doing everything wrong?” someone joked. “Might not be the biggest thing but I just learned something new,” another wrote. “I’ve been doing this forever. I didn’t know others were doing it wrong,” a person commented. “True. I found out this myself accidentally,” a user replied. “Who knew Post-it notes needed directions on the package?” a TikToker responded.

5/19/2022,"A passenger aboard a cruise ship sailing along southern Alaska fell off the vessel in the middle of the night and vanished, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. It happened around 3 a.m. Tuesday, May 17, as the cruise ship Celebrity Solstice was passing Eldred Rock in Lynn Canal, officials said in a news release. Investigators have not released the identity of the 40-year-old woman. The ship’s captain reported she fell overboard, but the circumstances were not revealed. The moment was recorded by a security camera, KOMO News reported. Coast Guard air and surface crews searched the canal, covering 68 nautical miles in 9 hours, according to an update. The search was suspended indefinitely late May 17. It is estimated an adult adrift in the 41-degree water has a “survival time of 6.19 hours,” Coast Guard officials told the Anchorage Daily News. “Despite our best efforts to locate the individual, it is with heavy hearts that we make the decision to suspend the search,” Coast Guard Lt.j.g. Trevor Layman said in a release. “The decision to suspend active searching is based on a number of factors including weather, sea state, water temperature and other variables.” The Celebrity Solstice has an occupancy of 2,852 people and was offering a trip to view Alaska’s Dawes Glacier, according to the cruise line’s website. Lynn Canal is a 90-mile long fjord in Southeast Alaska and is considered “the deepest fjord in North America at over 2,000 feet (233 fathoms),” according to Alaska Guide Co.

5/19/2022,"When dealing with manipulative or narcissistic people in your life, the best option is to cut contact and leave. But what if that isn't possible? The reality is, not everyone can escape a toxic relationship – especially when it involves co-workers, in-laws or a co-parent. That's why relationship and mental health experts are recommending an alternative in setting boundaries with these people, and it's called the ""gray rock method."" Also known as graywalling or gray rocking, this strategy involves being as disengaged and unresponsive as possible. The goal is to keep your responses limited in order to make the person you are communicating with lose interest in you. ""It's when somebody tries to make themselves as boring and nonreactive as possible to decrease the amount of provoking or emotional reactions,"" says Deborah Ashway, a licensed mental health counselor in North Carolina. ""Because when somebody doesn't give the manipulator the responses they want, they're no longer able to push their buttons."" What is 'hoovering'?: Narcissists often try to win back their exes with ‘hoovering;’ experts say it’s emotional blackmail. Video: Can social media use put you at higher risk for depression, anxiety? More time spent on social media correlates to a variety of mental health issues. Here's when social media can become harmful for users. Gray rocking is one of many communication techniques when dealing with narcissism and manipulation. Some examples include avoiding eye contact, maintaining a flat tone in your communication, or responding with simple answers like ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""I didn't know that."" Advice column: My ex-wife's petty behavior has caused our son emotional distress. What can I do about it? ""The first step is to visualize yourself as a gray rock,"" says Holly Richmond, a licensed marriage and family therapist. ""You're this immovable, impenetrable force who is disinterested. If they ask you a question, say yes or no and don't give details about your life or admit you're practicing this gray rock method."" Richmond says she recommends gray rocking over yelling or defending yourself, which are likely to provoke the narcissist's damaging behavior. Are you dating a narcissist?: Watch out for these red flags. ""Any kind of attention, even negative, is good for a narcissist and they will take that over no attention at all,"" Richmond says. ""The gray rock method works because it's the most minimal amount you can possibly offer and they'll get bored or lose interest in manipulating you."" However, those who are co-parenting after separation may want to opt for a slight variation of gray rocking called yellow rocking, which involves ""the infusion of a little more emotion in communication,"" according to Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist and author of ""Should I Stay or Should I Go?"" ""You can't be a complete robot in front of your kid, so yellow rocking infuses a bit more emotion into the communication that goes beyond the flatness of gray rocking,"" Durvasula says. ""For example, instead of just saying yes, no, you say, 'Oh wow, I didn't know. Thank you so much.'"" 'I felt as if I was dead to her': The psychological cost of the silent treatment While experts say gray rocking is effective in the long run, it may do more harm than good, and not everyone can stomach it. ""This method could aggravate them more, because they're not getting the reaction they're used to,"" Ashway warns. ""They may feel their power slipping or their control over you waning, and as a result, they might double down on the manipulation tactics they used to provoke a reaction out of you.""

5/19/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Russia will not get away with trying to redraw Ukraine's borders by creating facts on the ground and waiting out Kyiv and its allies, Olaf Scholz said, insisting that the West would not stand for a ""diktat,"" or dictated, peace forced on the country. Ukraine's President Voldomyr said last week that Kyiv would not trade territory for peace with Russia, telling Italy's RAI television that he had been asked by French President Emmanuel Macron to consider doing so. The French government has denied that any such suggestion had been made. On Monday, Scholz said that such stealth border changes would not be accepted by the West if Ukraine objected to them. ""There is only one way out of this for Russia and that is reaching an agreement with Ukraine,"" he told RTL television. ""And that doesn't mean a diktat peace, taking a bit of territory and then saying 'sign here'. ""And it also won't work as in the case of Crimea, where the war is over in the sense that there is no more shooting, but a new border has been drawn, and then they wait until everything goes back to normal,"" he added. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and has since claimed a sovereignty over the Black Sea peninsula. Russia's claim is rejected by Kyiv and all but a handful of other countries. Weapons deliveries to help Ukraine defend itself from Russia's invasion and sanctions against Moscow were designed to make it clear that ""an agreement with Ukraine is unavoidable, and there is no way around this for President (Putin)."" Moscow calls its invasion of Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to rid the country of fascists, an assertion Kyiv and its Western allies say is a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war.

5/19/2022,"The market doesn’t seem able to find a bottom. The S&P 500 has fallen about 16% year to date, while the tech-centric Nasdaq is down 26% over the same time frame. But CNBC’s Jim Cramer sees plenty of opportunity amid the market downturn. In fact, the Mad Money host recently revealed two stocks that he wants to buy right now. Here’s a quick look at each one of them. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Cramer has been a fan of Apple for years. He says that he’s been ‘long’ on the company ever since his daughter owned a blue and a pink iPod. And due to the recent drop in Apple’s share price — the tech giant is down 20% year to date — Cramer thinks it's time to hit the buy button once again. “I want to buy it. I upgraded for the charitable trust. It’s been straight down,” he says. In the latest earnings conference call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company hasn’t been immune to supply chain disruptions. CFO Luca Maestri added that supply constraints — resulting from COVID-related disruptions and silicon shortages — could impact sales by $4 billion to $8 billion. That said, Cramer thinks the iPhone maker will be fine, citing his recent interview with Micron Technology CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. “He said phones are good,” Cramer recalls. “Higher-end phones? Good.” In the most recent quarter, iPhone sales grew 5.5% year over year to $50.6 billion and accounted for 52% of Apple’s total sales. As a leading manufacturer of graphics cards, Nvidia shares have had a solid bull run over the past decade. But that rally came to an abrupt end in November 2021. Since reaching a peak of $346 in late November, the stock has fallen about 50%. Nvidia’s plunge is substantial even when compared to other beaten-down stocks in the semiconductor sector. And Cramer has taken notice. “Nvidia has been cut in half,” he says on CNBC. “It’s the worst chart I’ve seen. Honestly, it’s so horrible that I want to buy it.” Nvidia’s business is performing well, making it a particularly intriguing contrarian idea. The chipmaker generated $7.64 billion of revenue in its fiscal Q4. The amount not only represented a 53% increase year over year, but also a new quarterly record. Revenue from gaming — Nvidia’s largest segment — increased 37% year over year to a record $3.42 billion. Meanwhile, data center — the company’s second-largest segment — saw revenue spike 71% to a record $3.26 billion. Nvidia is scheduled to report Q1 FY23 results on May 25 after the closing bell.

5/19/2022,"A military analyst on one of Russian state television’s most popular networks left his fellow panelists in stunned silence Monday when he said that the conflict in Ukraine was deteriorating for Russia, giving the kind of honest assessment that is virtually banished from the official airwaves. “The situation for us will clearly get worse,” Mikhail M. Khodaryonok, a retired colonel and a conservative columnist on military affairs, said during the “60 Minutes” talk-show program on the Rossiya network. It was a rare moment of frank analysis in a country where criticizing the war effort can result in a prison sentence and broadcasters have generally adhered to the Kremlin’s talking points. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times The problems that Khodaryonok referred to, sometimes obliquely, included low morale, the array of Western countries aligned against Russia and the amount of fighters and matériel that Ukraine was assembling. “We are in total geopolitical isolation, and the whole world is against us, even if we don’t want to admit it,” said Khodaryonok, noting that Russia’s “resources, military-political and military-technical, are limited.” He urged Russians not to take “informational sedatives.” The clip was first highlighted by Francis Scarr of BBC Monitoring, which tracks Russian broadcasts. Khodaryonok did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. Aside from questioning Russia’s position, it was a remarkable moment because Khodaryonok noted that Ukraine seemed to have momentum. Russians mistakenly tended to try to extrapolate the problems of a few soldiers in the Ukrainian army to denigrate its whole military, he said. In reality, they were ready to field 1 million men if given sufficient weapons, were highly motivated and would be receiving an increasing quantity of military support from the United States and Europe, he added. News talk shows in Russia are generally a shouting match, with the half dozen panelists each vying to drown out the others. On this episode, however, the other panelists stood in stunned silence. Only Olga Skabeyeva, the host, who religiously follows the Kremlin line, interrupted with official talking points in sometimes tense exchanges. She attempted to point out that support from China and India was just as good as support from Europe, that perhaps professional soldiers were superior to conscripts and that Russia “had no choice,” the standard Kremlin justification for its invasion by presenting Ukraine as a threat. Khodaryonok seemed to be careful not to say anything openly critical of the Russian side, repeatedly stressing that the entire situation was “not normal.” When it came to morale issues, for example, he reached back into history and noted that Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin had said that high morale was an important factor for battlefield success. He did not refer directly to recent indications that the Russian army is suffering from morale problems. In March, Russia criminalized denouncing its war effort, including even referring to it as a war rather than a “special military operation.” Khodaryonok has been critical of the Russian military operations in the past. In an unusual column published in early February, before the invasion, he cautioned against it, saying that it would not be the cake walk that many Russian analysts expected and that it was not in Russia’s “national interests.” He predicted accurately that the Ukrainians would fight hard to defend their country and that the West would provide extensive arms. “There will be no blitzkrieg in Ukraine,” he wrote in Nezavisimoye Voyennoye Obozreniye, a Russian weekly newspaper supplement on military matters. Even earlier, about a year after Russia dispatched its military to Syria in 2015 to prop up President Bashar Assad, he wrote a column for an internet news service, Gazeta.Ru, suggesting that the Syrian army was an unworthy ally, pointing out its lack of military success and corruption. Concerning the war in Ukraine, however, he has previously praised the Russian effort. In comments on his Telegram channel posted only a week ago, he said that military theorists for years to come would study the special operation as something “unique.” He said Russian advances in the eastern Donbas region were due to the discipline, training and morale of its military, as well as the effectiveness of its artillery. He also repeated the unfounded Russian claim that the Ukrainian side fostered Nazis. © 2022 The New York Times Company",World/The New York Times,"On a Russian Talk Show, Retired Colonel Stuns Colleagues by Saying Invasion Isn't Going Well",https://news.yahoo.com/russian-talk-show-retired-colonel-184207547.html
5/19/2022,"BERLIN (AP) — Germany's three governing parties plan to strip former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of his office and staff after he maintained and defended his long-standing ties with Russia despite the war in Ukraine. Schroeder's own Social Democratic Party said Wednesday that lawmakers on the parliamentary budget committee had agreed to link some of the former German leader's privileges to actual duties, rather than his status as former chancellor. They planned to submit a proposal to lawmakers on Thursday. Schroeder has become increasingly isolated in recent months due to his work for Russian state-controlled energy companies. The 78-year-old is chairman of the supervisory board of Russian state energy company Rosneft and also has been involved with the Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline projects. Earlier this year his office staff quit and Schroeder faced a fresh wave of outrage from former political allies after the New York Times quoted him saying that the massacre of civilians in Bucha “has to be investigated” but he didn’t think the orders would have come from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is a longtime friend. ___ Follow all AP stories on Russia’s war on Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,German ex-leader Schroeder loses privileges over Russia ties,https://news.yahoo.com/german-ex-leader-schroeder-loses-090414518.html
