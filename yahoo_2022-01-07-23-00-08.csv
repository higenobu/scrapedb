1/7/2022,"HMS Northumberland was hit by a Russian submarine in the north Atlantic in late 2020. The moment was caught on video by a documentary film crew from the UK's Channel 5. The Royal Navy feared the submarine may have been trying to tap into undersea internet cables. New video footage shows the moment that sailors with Britain's Royal Navy realized they had been hit by the Russian submarine they were tracking. HMS Northumberland, a 133-meter submarine tracker, collided with the Russian vessel in the north Atlantic in late 2020, the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) told Insider in a statement. At the time of the collision, a camera crew from the UK's Channel 5 network were on board to film an episode of ""Warship: Life at Sea."" A clip from the episode was obtained by MailOnline and The Times of London. The episode is due to premiere on January 17. In the clip published by MailOnline, a loud alarm begins to sound in the bridge, and crew members are heard asking ""what the hell was that?"" and ""what happened?"" Watch the moment around the 1-minute, 33-second mark: According to the MOD, the Russian submarine had just hit the ship's sonar equipment, which is trailed hundreds of meters behind the vessel. ""In late 2020 a Russian submarine being tracked by HMS Northumberland came into contact with her towed array sonar,"" a spokesman for the MOD said. ""The Royal Navy regularly tracks foreign ships and submarines in order to ensure the defense of the United Kingdom."" HMS Northumberland had been sent on a 48-hour mission to track down the Russian submarine, over fears that it may try to access undersea cables and intercept communications. A British defense official told Insider there was no indication that the collision was deliberate. The Kremlin did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. After the collision, HMS Northumberland returned to a port in Scotland so the damaged equipment could be replaced. In the Channel 5 episode, the ship and camera crew briefly spot the periscope of the Russian submarine above the water, The Times of London reported. ""We are very close to the submarine — we are probably parallel. If they were on the surface we would definitely see faces,"" Commander Thom Hobbs told the Channel 5 crew shortly before the collision. On December 4, 2020, the Royal Navy said it had tracked nine Russian vessels close to UK waters in recent weeks.

1/7/2022,"It's been three years since police officers showed up at Melanie Addie's front door and dropped two bombshells on her at once: Not only did her now ex-husband of 23 years have a fiancee he was planning to marry, but that the woman had just been murdered. ""It was just mind-boggling. It made no sense at all,"" Melanie Addie told ""20/20."" ""It didn't seem right. This was not my life."" James Addie, 56, was convicted in 2021 of first-degree murder and armed criminal action for the death of 35-year-old Molly Watson. He was sentenced in July to life in prison without parole plus 10 years. Investigators said James Addie was in a seven-year relationship with Watson and was engaged to marry her two days after he killed her. Her body was found outside of her car on a rural road in Monroe County, Missouri, with a single gunshot wound to the back of her head, according to authorities. James Addie has long maintained his innocence, but his ex-wife said she believes he is capable of murder. ""He was a pretty selfish person … He could be controlling and intimidating … it could be challenging,"" Melanie Addie said. ""It just seemed like something he would do to fix a problem."" Watch the full story on ""20/20"" FRIDAY, Jan. 7 at 9 p.m. ET on ABC Melanie Addie said she never suspected her husband was having an affair, and thought her ex-husband was dedicated to his family. The couple has two kids, a daughter Emma and a son Ben. Melanie Addie worked as a teacher’s assistant while James Addie worked as a corrections officer. ""He seemed the same all the time,"" Melanie Addie said. ""He would get off work at 3 [p.m.] … and usually he would get home at 5 and I would say, 'Why are you always so late?'… and that would be an argument. He didn't want to tell me anything."" At one point, Melanie Addie said her ex-husband went off on trips. One was to Florida that she said James Addie told her was for work, and one was a trip to Mexico that she said he told her was a getaway with friends. ""I never really knew his work friends… [so it] seems plausible,"" she said. On April 27, 2018, everything seemed normal, Melanie Addie said, and her husband ""seemed like he always did."" ""About seven o'clock, he came into the living room where I was and said he was going to a friend's house,"" she said.

She said she did what she always does, which is get up and move to the couch. About 30 minutes later, Melanie Addie said she saw police lights outside. A few weeks after his arrest, Melanie Addie filed for divorce. ""He had always been very hard on me about how a wife should act and how life should be, and then he did this. He had an affair, and that's OK? No. We were done,"" she said. Melanie Addie decided to search the house for any evidence of her husband's affair. She said she found photos of James Addie and Watson together at Disney World in Florida in a lofted storage area of their garage. She said she asked herself over and over how she could have missed the affair. ""I guess because I wasn't supposed to see it,"" Melanie Addie said. Melanie Addie said she visited him in jail about a week after his arrest. ""[He said] he's very sorry for the affair, but he insists that he was not the killer,"" she said. ""I looked at him as someone I didn't want back."" At trial, prosecutors presented a theory for James Addie's motive for killing Watson. They argued he had told her Melanie Addie was his ex-wife and had died in a car accident and she had discovered that wasn't true. ""Forensic searches of Molly's phones indicated that the day before she was murdered, she was looking for Melanie Addie's obituary,"" prosecutor Talley Smith said. Melanie Addie was called to testify against Addie at his trial, which she said was ""just horrible."" ""You don't want to be there. I don't want to be in a position where I'm hurting him,"" she said.

He also asked for a new trial, claiming his defense attorney was ineffective and didn't present all of the evidence in support of his case. ""There is no way that I could have done this crime,"" he told the court. ""The only one I hold at fault in this entire process is my attorney because he had the means and he had the ability to present my case and he failed to do it whenever I asked him.""

1/7/2022,"Xiang Haitao, 44, worked for Monsanto in Missouri from 2008 to 2017. The DOJ said he stole a secret algorithm before leaving and planned to pass it to China. The US identified bioeconomy as one of the key areas where China is trying to steal US intelligence. A Chinese scientist has admitted stealing trade secrets from the agrochemical giant Monsanto, the Justice Department said Thursday. Xiang Haitao, 44, worked as an imaging scientist for Monsanto in Missouri between 2008 and 2017, during which time Monsanto and its subsidiary The Climate Corporation worked on a secret algorithm known as the ""Nutrient Optimizer,"" the department said, citing court documents. The algorithm helped farmers their productivity, the DOJ said. Before leaving the company, Xiang downloaded a copy of the algorithm, and then flew to China on a one-way ticket, the department said. Law-enforcement officers searched Xiang's electronics at the airport, but he was ultimately allowed to leave the US, the department said. Investigators later concluded that ""one of Xiang's electronic devices contained copies of the Nutrient Optimizer,"" the DOJ said. US law-enforcement officials were able to arrest Xiang after he returned to the US sometime between 2017 and 2019, the department said. Xiang pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit economic espionage on Thursday, the department said. He faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and a potential $5 million fine. In China, Xiang went on to work for the Institute of Soil Science at the state-run Chinese Academy of Science in Nanjing, the DOJ said. The department said Xiang intended to pass the stolen materials on to the Chinese government. It is unclear if the government was able to make use of the ""Nutrient Optimizer."" ""Despite Xiang's agreements to protect Monsanto's intellectual property and repeated training on his obligations to do so, Xiang has now admitted that he stole a trade secret from Monsanto, transferred it to a memory card and attempted to take it to the People's Republic of China for the benefit of Chinese government,"" Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen said in a statement. In October, the US National Counterintelligence and Security Center identified bioeconomy as one of the key areas where China is trying to steal US intelligence, as Insider's Stavros Atlamazoglou previously reported. ""These sectors produce technologies that may determine whether America remains the world's leading superpower or is eclipsed by strategic competitors in the next few years,"" the NCSC said. Tom Armitage, a spokesperson for Bayer, which owns Monsanto, told Insider: ""The protection of intellectual property is essential for innovation across industries."" After Xiang was indicted by a grand jury in 2019, China's foreign ministry said the US was using the case to make the baseless claim that China conducts widespread espionage in the US. ""We resolutely oppose the US side's attempts to use the case, which we regard as an ordinary, isolated incident, to hype up claims of China's organized and systematic attempts to steal intellectual property from the US,"" spokesman Geng Shuang said.
