3/23/2022,"High gasoline prices are already impacting demand, according to one energy expert. ""Above $4 per gallon, you do see the American public change their driving habits. And we do actively see demand destruction,"" Regina Mayor, global head of energy at KPMG, told Yahoo Finance Live. ""I think that's one of the things that helps the overall tightness of supply, is when we see demand start to dip back down,"" she added. U.S. West Texas intermediate (CL=F) and Brent (BZ=F) have seen massive price swings since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war. Western nations imposed sanctions against Russia, a world crude exporter. The U.S. and U.K. also implemented a ban on Russian oil imports. Gasoline's national price average currently sits at $4.24 per gallon. Mayor expects prices to stay elevated for a while as we head into the summer driving season. ""We've got summer vacations. The travel industry is anticipating that airline activity will be higher because there's a lot of pent-up demand from the pandemic. And this is when gas prices typically are higher anyway,"" said Mayor. ""We've got crude oil prices that are through the roof. So unfortunately, I think in the near-term, consumers are going to still be seeing very high prices at the pump,"" she said. On Tuesday, WTI futures were down more than 1%, hovering above $110 per barrel. Brent crude was also slightly lower, is sitting above $114 per barrel.

3/23/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- In an industry pressured by soaring inflation, Nike Inc. is suffering more than most as its exposure to the fallout from the war in Ukraine and supply-chain issues put its shares on track for their worst quarter since 2008.

The company will report fiscal third-quarter earnings after markets close on Monday. Production shortfalls and transport delays in particular make for a “tough-to-predict” report, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger.

The third-party pledge guarantee wipes out most of Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd.’s cash holdings. “It’s peculiar because investors expect Evergrande management should be aware of where the cash went rather than instead setting up an investigation committee to find out,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Andrew Chan. While the 13.4 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) in seized cash is small in the context of the broader restructuring, it raises questions over the reliability of the financial accounts of the services unit “if the group plans to sell it at a good price to achieve maximum recovery for creditors,” Chan said.

3/23/2022,"The S&P 500 is rallying again during the trading session on Tuesday to reach the crucial 4500 level in the futures market. If we can break above here and stay above there, then it is very likely that we may have seen the S&P 500 trying to turn everything around. That being said, the next battle will be the 4600 level, which is where we had seen a small “double top.” The market will continue to be very noisy in general, especially as we have so many different fundamental reasons to think that the volatility is going to get worse, not better. However, it is worth noting that traders are starting to come to grips with the idea of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, so that may be a fundamental factor the people are starting to ignore again. Looking at this chart, if we were to break down below the 50 Day EMA, then it is possible that we break down but right now it certainly looks as if the market is going to ignore most things and simply rally. At this point, there is probably a certain amount of FOMO being seen on the charts as well, so it is what it is. I expect a lot of choppy and volatile noise, but it is probably worth noting that the rally has been parabolic, so one has to wonder how many more days in a row we can get this?

3/23/2022,"With inflation and growth concerns swirling over the markets, Jerome Powell dropped a tantalizing clue on Monday about how the Federal Reserve will approach its next rate-setting meeting in May. To have spotted the sign, you’d have to be a top-notch Fed-jargon parser. In a speech yesterday, Powell added a new adverb—“expeditiously”—to his vocabulary about just how aggressively the central bank could hike rates this year. He also signaled being open to a 50-basis–point rate hike, all but closing the door on a 13-year stretch of loose monetary policy and rock-bottom lending rates. Wall Street pounced on the Powell speech, with a series of new bets that the Fed will be even more hawkish than previously thought. “Our best guess is that the shift in wording from ‘steadily’ in January to ‘expeditiously’ today is a signal that a 50bp rate hike is coming,” Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote in an investor note. “We now forecast 50bp hikes at both the May and June meetings, followed by 25bp hikes at the four remaining meetings in the back half of 2022, and three quarterly hikes in 2023 Q1–Q3.” Add that up, and the benchmark Federal funds interest rate could move above 3% in 18 months’ time—not great news for aspiring homebuyers or people who have variable-rate mortgages. The Fed’s aggressive ramp-up in rates is looking like nothing we’ve seen in recent years, noted Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank global head of thematic research, a sign the central bank feels it’s behind the curve in keeping inflation—running at a 40-year-high—in check. “It’s increasingly dawning on investors that this is going to be a very different hiking cycle from its predecessor back in 2015, and yesterday Fed funds futures moved to price in more than 200bps worth of hikes for 2022 for the first time (including the 25bps we saw last week),” Reid wrote on Tuesday. Following the Powell speech, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped 14 basis points on Monday, and equities sank in afternoon trading. U.S. futures are doing a bit better on Tuesday, with the S&P up 0.4% at 5 a.m. ET. European bourses were in the green at the open as well, as most risk assets were rebounding. Crypto prices, for example, were gaining with Bitcoin up to $42,500, an increase of more than 3% in the past 24 hours. Investors are taking heart that the closely watched spread between short- and long-term bonds—measured as the difference between the yield on a two-year Treasury note and that of a 10-year Treasury note—has been widening in recent weeks, a sign that Wall Street sees the chance of a recession is on the wane.

3/23/2022,"When it comes time to start taking your retirement income, you'll hopefully have an array of options available to you: Social Security benefits, 401(k) and IRA funds, dividends from stock investments, and other assets you can liquidate. But how you tap those various sources of income is hugely important. Withdrawing assets in the wrong order, taking benefits at the wrong age, or failing to consider tax implications can wind up undermining your retirement income. To make sure you're making the most of your nest egg, be sure to avoid these retirement withdrawal mistakes. A financial advisor can help you optimize your retirement income strategy. Find an advisor today. Withdrawing from your investments first gives your retirement accounts more time to grow through compound interest. If you dive straight into your 401(k) or IRA, you could cost yourself years' worth of income in retirement savings. Whether you have mutual funds, a brokerage account, ETFs, stocks or bonds, they’re all taxable, so you’ll have to pay capital gains taxes on withdrawals. Some investments also require you to pay taxes on distributions each year, like some mutual funds. Check with a fiduciary financial advisor to see if this is the case for your accounts. All of the financial advisors on SmartAsset’s matching platform are registered fiduciaries, who are legally bound to act in your best interest. If your advisor is not a fiduciary and constantly pushes investment products on you, use this no-cost tool to find an advisor who has your best interest in mind. If you want your maximum Social Security benefits, you’ll need to work until your “full retirement” age. But benefits at age 62, 66 or 67 are not your maximum benefits. The maximum Social Security retirement benefit kicks in at age 70. If you claim before, you're not getting your full entitlement. Each year after full retirement, your payout increases by a certain percentage based on specific criteria. To maximize on this strategy, we recommend holding off until you are 70 — payments will be the highest possible, increasing by 8% each year you wait. While this strategy will help you collect the highest Social Security benefit, every situation is different. Consult a financial advisor to figure out how and when Social Security benefits should factor into your unique retirement plan. You can start withdrawing money from your 401(k) when you turn 59 1/2, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea. The law doesn't require you to start taking Required Minimum Distributions until you turn 72, so this is time your money can keep growing with compound interest. Put off withdrawing money from your Roth IRA as long as possible. You paid taxes up front so you can take money out of your Roth IRA and it won’t count as taxable income. Your Roth IRA also will continue to grow tax-free as you tap into your other accounts. Since a Roth IRA holds after-tax funds and the IRS doesn’t need to tax it again, you also don’t need to take Required Minimum Distributions. This account can keep growing for as long as you don't touch it. Determining the optimal sequence to withdraw money from your retirement accounts is different for everyone, so we recommend speaking with a financial advisor. Voya Financial found that 79% of people who use an advisor said they “know how to pursue achieving their retirement goals.” The study also found that 59% of those who use an advisor have calculated how much they need to retire, while 52% established a formal retirement investment plan.5 Chances are, there are several highly qualified financial advisors in your town. However, it can seem daunting to choose one. Our no-cost tool helps makes it easy to find a qualified advisor. You can get matched with up to three fiduciary investment advisors that have been vetted and subject to our due diligence criteria. You even earn 3 free consultations with each of our matches, so you can compare them and be fully prepared to pick a financial advisor. The entire matching process takes just a few minutes.

3/23/2022,"Mirroring the markets’ overall trend, the biotech sector has not gotten off to a good start in 2022, as evidenced by the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (NBI) tilting 12% into the red year-to-date. However, according to Yaron Werber, biotech analyst at investment firm Cowen, that is not necessarily indicative of how the rest of the year will pan out. In fact, taking the Cowen Annual Health Care Conference in late February/early March (this year’s took place between March 7-9) as a “time point” that can be used to forecast annual performance, the findings paint an upbeat picture. “A negative start followed by positive performance during the Cowen HC conference (matching the current set up in 2022) has been associated with positive performance for the remainder of the year in 3 of 3 instances over the last 22 years (2003, 2009, 2020),” the 5-star analyst said. “This provides a reason to be optimistic that sentiment may be shifting in the sector.” So, it’s time to look at some promising names operating in the biotech space. We delved into the TipRanks database and zeroed in on three such stocks. All offer a bullish profile; rated Strong Buys by the analyst consensus and projected to bring home some serious gains over the coming months. Let’s see what makes them such appealing picks right now. Altimmune (ALT) We’ll first take a look at Altimmune, a clinical-stage biopharma working on novel peptide-based therapeutics indicated as therapies for liver diseases and obesity. Altimmune’s lead candidate is ALT-801 (Pemvidutide), a distinctive peptide-based dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonist which is undergoing testing for the treatment of obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Obesity is a common cause of NASH, and ALT-801 will try to address it. If approved, ALT-801 could be something of a game-changing medicine in obesity and NASH treatment - both are substantial unmet medical needs - by helping to lower body weight and comorbidities. Earlier this year, the FDA gave the all-clear for the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for its Phase 2 clinical trial of pemvidutide for obesity. The company still expects to initiate the study this quarter. An interim analysis is planned to assess changes in body weight following 24 weeks of treatment, with an expected readout in 4Q22. The readout will form part of what JMP analyst Jonathan Wolleben calls a “data-rich year.” Before that Q4 readout, Q3 should see the release of key 12-week data from the Phase 1b NAFLD study, and Wolleben has high hopes regarding the outcome. “New data coming in 3Q22 from a Phase 1b in NAFLD patients could continue to support a best-in-class profile for pemvidutide,” wrote the analyst. “We expect the 12-week NAFLD data could replicate the unprecedented liver fat reductions observed already with best-in-class weight loss to boot. We also expect more data will assuage some investor concerns over the single ALT elevation observed in the prior Phase 1. To that end, ALT expects to have safety data from >200 subjects treated with pemvi by 4Q.” Overall, the analyst summed up, ""The pemvidutide data to date are quite compelling, in our view... We continue to recommend ALT shares and point to multiple catalysts in 2022, which we expect could provide a boost to shares in the near term..."" Accordingly, Wolleben rates ALT shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), while his $24 price target shows room for growth of a hefty 257% over the coming year. (To watch Wolleben’s track record, click here) The rest of the Street is in full agreement. Based on Buys only – 6, in total – the stock boasts a Strong Buy consensus rating. At $25, the average target is just above Wolleben’s and set to generate returns of 272% in the year ahead. (See ALT stock forecast on TipRanks) Adicet Bio (ACET) The next biotech stock we’ll look at is Adicet, a company targeting the development of engineered T cell-based therapies against cancer. To do so, the clinical-stage biotech makes use of a differentiated class of T lymphocytes called gamma delta (γδ) T cells. Given gamma delta T cells’ unique properties – they can home in on and eliminate tumor cells while skipping over normal, healthy cells – the treatments have the potential to produce longer-lasting therapeutic activity while also having a better safety profile, making them very appealing for the treatment of solid malignancies. Most of Adicet's pipeline is still in the early stages but leading the way and further along in development is ADI-001, indicated for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In December, an interim data readout from the ongoing Phase 1 trial was highly promising and showed 2 complete responses (CR) and one partial response (PR). The company expects to present additional interim data during 1H22. In another important development, in January, Regeneron opted into the company’s solid tumors program by deciding to license the exclusive, worldwide rights to ADI-002, an allogeneic gamma delta CAR T cell therapy targeting Glypican-3. As a result, the company received an exercise fee of $20 million. Based on the above, Adicet has caught the eye of Guggenheim analyst Michael Schmidt, who thinks the company's prospective treatments could represent an “intriguing new class of therapeutics within the adoptive cell therapy space,” while the share price looks appealing too. “In light of the key de-risking clinical data presented in December, we continue to think ACET trades at an extremely attractive valuation,” the 5-star analyst said. “ACET is well financed with cash runway into 2023, and we continue to believe ACET shares are set up well to outperform the XBI longer term as the company successfully advances development of existing product candidates towards additional clinical proof-of-concept and via general validation of γδ T cell technology driven by increasing industry interest in the technology.” Unsurprisingly, Schmidt puts a Buy rating on ACET shares, backed by a $22 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of ~102% from current levels. (To watch Schmidt’s track record, click here) This is another name with the Street’s full support. All 6 recent analyst reviews are positive, naturally culminating in a Strong Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for one-year gains of ~87%, considering the average target clocks in at $29.67. (See Adicet stock forecast on TipRanks) Seres Therapeutics (MCRB) Last but not least is Seres Therapeutics, a clinical stage company hoping to impact patients’ lives with what it terms “revolutionary microbiome therapeutics.” Research has shown that gut microbiome has a big role to play in the health of the human body. By creating metabolites that interact with other microorganisms and the host, bacteria, a significant component of the gut microbiome, can influence various bodily functions including metabolism, and immune and inflammatory responses. The company’s pipeline includes two therapies indicted to treat ulcerative colitis (UC) - SER-287 and SER-301 - and another - SER-155 – which is currently in a Phase 1b study assessing the effects of the drug in lowering the incidence of infections and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in immunocompromised patients. But the candidate making the biggest splash so far is SER-109, indicated for the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection (CDI). In the Phase 3 clinical trial, the treatment met the primary endpoint of showing an advantage over the placebo in reducing CDI recurrence. The company is currently getting the BLA ready for filing with the FDA, which should take place around mid-2022. H.C. Wainwright’s Vernon Bernardino is confident the treatment is destined for success. He writes, “We believe there is substantial commercial opportunity for SER-109 given that there are approximately 170,000 cases of rCDI and CDI results in over 20,000 deaths annually in the U.S. Additionally, with the cost to treat a patient with rCDI approximately $34,000 in annual direct healthcare expenses, which does not include substantial indirect costs, rCDI creates a significant burden to the healthcare system. Overall, we anticipate approval of SER-109 in 1Q23 given two months for acceptance of the Biologics Licensing Application (BLA) and a six-month priority review.” Accordingly, Bernardino rates MCRB a Buy, and has a $25 price target for the shares. Should the target be met, investors are looking at returns of a strong 239%. (To watch Bernardino’s track record, click here) 2 other analysts have reviewed Seres’ prospects recently and both have reached the same positive conclusion, making the consensus view on this name a Strong Buy. The average price target currently comes in at $18, suggesting shares could climb ~144% higher in the year ahead.

3/23/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s been a month since the war started, but Russia is actually shipping more natural gas through Ukraine and Moscow is still paying Kyiv in full for transiting the fuel to Europe. Most Read from Bloomberg China Jet’s Nosedive From 29,000 Feet Baffles Crash Specialists Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time Xi Risks Leaving China Isolated by Backing Putin to Counter U.S. China Plane Crash Update: Wreckage Found, Airline Grounds Jets China Eastern Boeing 737 Jet Crashes With More Than 130 on Board Daily gas flows from Russia at some point surged more than 50% from January lows, with shipments traveling through Ukrainian pipelines more than doubling as energy companies rushed to buy after the invasion. Exports from Europe’s top supplier became cheaper than buying gas in the spot market, and Russia is still paying for transit in hard currency, according to Yuriy Vitrenko, chief executive officer of NJSC Naftogaz Ukrainy, Ukraine’s largest state-owned oil and gas company. It’s an awkward situation for European policy makers, which have imposed several rounds of sanctions on Moscow to try to starve President Vladimir Putin’s government of the cash it needs to fund the invasion. The increase also comes as European governments pledge to wean themselves off Russian gas, with plans to keep nuclear and coal plants open for longer and import more liquefied natural gas from countries including the U.S. and Qatar. Russian gas flows to Europe soared to the highest level since December in the 48 hours after the war began. State-run exporter Gazprom PJSC said supplies increased due to more orders from European customers, and for some time, shipments through another major Russian pipeline crossing Belarus and Poland and ending in Germany resumed after a two-month halt. The increase in imports from Russia reflects the lack of options that European customers have in the near term to meet demand, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts said in a report last week. Naftogaz called on Europe and its allies to put payments for Moscow’s energy flows in an escrow account until Putin withdraws troops. That would further curb funding to Moscow just as cargoes of crude oil and grains from Russia are also finding a way to flow again. Ukraine has said before that Gazprom pays about $2 billion per year for gas-transshipment services.
