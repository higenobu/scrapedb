No 10 was expected to make an announcement at 4pm, the day after Boris Johnson said western nations would need a “step-by-step transition period” away from Russian hydrocarbons. Johnson has indicated he wants to move with international partners in the west on phasing out Russian oil, with cargoes already being turned away from British ports. Ministers are also looking at how to reduce the UK’s gas from Russia down from 4% to 0% as part of its forthcoming energy strategy, which was due this week but may be delayed until next week. Any move to ban Russian oil imports is likely to be brought in over several months, with the government stressing that people should not panic buy fuel.",News/World news,No 10 expected to outline plans to cut use of Russian fossil fuels,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/no-10-plans-cut-russian-fossil-fuels-use
3/9/2022,"Russian soldiers have been accused of multiple instances of deadly fire on civilian vehicles across Ukraine. In a series of incidents in recent days, civilian deaths have been reported from the town of Makariv outside Kyiv – also the location of the deadly bombing of a bakery on Monday in which 13 people died – and on a minibus carrying teachers to an orphanage in the southern city of Mykolaiv. Video circulating on Ukrainian Telegram channels on Tuesday claimed to show footage of civilians being killed in Makariv. In the video a black car, travelling close what appears to be a security camera mounted on a wall, is seen first driving into shot and then immediately stopping when the occupants, said to be an elderly couple, see a Russian BMP armoured vehicle approaching the crossroads ahead of them at speed. With the civilian car at a halt the Russian armoured car takes a slight turn at the junction and, still moving, fires two rounds from a heavy calibre weapon at the vehicle, destroying it. The armoured car then pauses for a moment then turns to disappear across the junction followed by other armoured vehicles that come into view. In the second incident reported on Tuesday, the head of Mykolaiv’s regional council, Anna Zamazeeva – a city currently under Russian attack – claimed three teachers who had been travelling by minibus to an orphanage for a shift change had been killed and two others wounded when their vehicle, marked with a red cross, came under fire. The latest two incidents come on top of the widely reported case of Anastasiia Yalanskaya, 26, who was shot and killed in her car by Russian forces after delivering food to a local dog shelter outside Kyiv. Yalanskaya, who had posted details of her plans to deliver food to the shelter, was one of three volunteers who travelled to Bucha, 18 miles outside of Kyiv. A few days before, Yalanskaya had detailed another trip to deliver aid to a nursery near Kyiv. “Blown up bridges and roads are terrible, houses destroyed by rockets, it’s monstrous,” she wrote. “If there is a sign [that says] ‘do not slow down’, you must obey.”",News/World news,Russian soldiers accused of firing on civilian vehicles in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/russian-soldiers-accused-of-firing-on-civilian-vehicles-in-ukraine
3/9/2022,"People up and down the entire US east coast may soon find themselves living with a large spider species that is a long way from its original home. According to researchers at the University of Georgia, the Joro spider, an invasive species native to east Asia, is expected to spread after thriving in the state last year. The spider, Trichonephila clavata, is known for its ability to spin highly organized, wheel-shaped webs. Females have blue, yellow and red markings and can measure up to 3in when fully extended. Researchers found that the Joro has double the metabolism of a relative, the golden silk spider, which moved to the US south-east from the tropics 160 years ago. Unlike the golden silk spider, which has been unable to spread north due to its inability to withstand cold temperatures, the Joro has a 77% higher heart rate and can thus survive freezes that kill off its cousins. According to the new study, Joro spiders, which predominantly hail from Japan, will likely survive on the US east coast because Japan has a very similar climate and is located approximately on the same latitude. “Just by looking at that, it looks like the Joros could probably survive throughout most of the eastern seaboard here, which is pretty sobering,” said Andy Davis, a research scientist at the Odum School of Ecology and co-author of the study. Last year, the spiders made their way through the yards of northern Georgia, spinning webs up to 3m deep. It is unclear how the spiders traveled from east Asia but researchers say their proliferation is likely due to changes in weather conditions. According to Davis, the Joro does not appear to have much of an impact on local food webs or ecosystems and may even serve as an additional food source for native predators like birds. “People should try to learn to live with them,” he said. “If they’re literally in your way, I can see taking a web down and moving them to the side, but they’re just going to be back next year.” Benjamin Frick, co-author of the study and an undergraduate researcher in the School of Ecology, said: “The way I see it, there’s no point in excess cruelty where it’s not needed. You have people with saltwater guns shooting them out of the trees and things like that, and that’s really just unnecessary.” Frick believes humans will help the spiders spread, saying: “The potential for these spiders to spread through people’s movements is very high … Anecdotally, right before we published this study, we got a report from a grad student at UGA who had accidentally transported one of these to Oklahoma.” The chances of a Joro spider climbing into a car or into luggage is quite high but researchers stress that there is no reason to panic. Although the spiders can bite, they are not a threat to humans as their fangs are often not large enough to puncture human skin. “There’s really no reason to go around actively squishing them,” Frick said. “Humans are at the root of their invasion. Don’t blame the Joro spider.”",News/US news,Huge invasive spiders native to Asia expected to spread along US east coast,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/08/invasive-joro-spider-us-east-coast

The decision not to show games in Russia, which relates to a deal with Rambler (Okko Sport), was made at a shareholders’ meeting on Tuesday. It had been expected after the league’s chief executive, Richard Masters, said last Thursday the situation was under review. “The league strongly condemns Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” a statement said. “We call for peace and our thoughts are with all those impacted. The £1m donation will be made to the Disasters Emergency Committee to deliver humanitarian aid directly to those in need.” The league showed solidarity with Ukraine across the most recent round of matches, including with captains wearing yellow and blue armbands and big screens displaying ‘Football Stands Together’ on the same colours. The Football Association has suspended its partnership with Russianbroadcasters over rights for the FA Cup, PA Media has reported. The quarter-final ties are due to take place on 19 and 20 March. The sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, said: “This is absolutely the right thing to do and we fully support the Premier League’s decision to stop broadcasting matches in Russia in response to Putin’s barbaric, senseless invasion of Ukraine.

3/9/2022,"As far as the cricket goes, you can probably gather all you need to know from the fact that it was the first Test in history with a century opening partnership for three innings in a row. Or from the fact that Australia never got close to batting a second time. In the end Pakistan made 728 runs for the loss of four wickets in the match. Fold in the Australian innings and it read 1187 for 14. What else could be expected on a pitch the colour and character of a tranquilised Labrador. Those conditions were the home team’s choice. Usually the Rawalpindi surface is green with grass and helpful for pace, but after Pakistan’s fast bowlers were scythed down by illness and injury, they turned the mower as ruthlessly on to the pitch itself. Fear of Australia’s bowling supremacy saw Pakistan surrender the team’s own edge: Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah showed pace and skill despite the lack of assistance, but were left a task too tall. But still, in other ways none of that seemed to matter. A team of Australians were playing Test cricket at Rawalpindi, the ground last trod by Mark Taylor when he made his famous triple century in 1998, and the match itself was secondary to everything that surrounded it for the full five days. Take the sound. Never at a cricket ground would you expect to hear such a sound. Hundreds of small horns, each being blown to form a single buzzing note. Abrasive on their own, annoying in clusters. But as each one in the ground was sounded at once, such as on the four occasions when Pakistan players reached centuries, the individual parts joined into something bigger, something singular, the noise vibrating through your body as if you were only a conduit. Take the weaponry. Never for a cricket match would you expect to see this. Police and soldiers stationed along highways, clustered under trees, riding in the backs of trucks that bristled with rifle barrels like war-bound porcupines. Snipers on the rooftops of hotel and stadium. Trucks and checkpoints and barricades for blocks around. Sniffer dogs and bomb-finders and metal detectors. Tall saturnine rangers. Through it all, chatter and jokes at each stop along the way, the camouflaged man checking your bag for the fourth time smiling brightly and asking, “How are you enjoying our security?” Even with this contribution, the clear sense of pride. This stat is an eye-popper. In 145 years of men's Test cricket, there have been 12 matches where an opening partnership has made a century stand in both innings.Abdullah Shafique has done it twice, and has played three Tests.#PakvAus Take the enthusiasm. On the final day, with the match all but mummified for display in a museum, the crowd still suffused it with life. Crowds of school-age girls matched Pakistan flag face-paint with hijabs while taking endless rounds of selfies in the stands, before their half-day adventure was over and they were back to class. Pindi Boys strutted the concourse with the vocalising and the strut of the residents of the Poultry Research Institute next to the stadium. Mosh-pits of fans still celebrating with the score at none for 220. There was no thought of a declaration, Pakistan choosing instead to keep Australia in the field with only three days until the next match. There was the ceremonial finishing move of Usman Khawaja becoming the ninth player to bowl, in front of the crowd from the town of his birth, a man with a solitary first-class wicket taken back in 2010. There was the Azan echoing over the ground from the towers of the Bait-ul-Mukurram mosque. Rush to prayer, rush to prayer.

3/9/2022,"Pep Guardiola has called Kyle Walker’s kicking of an RB Leipzig player “stupid” with the defender banned for Wednesday’s Champions League visit of Sporting and Manchester City’s manager having only 14 senior players available. João Cancelo is ill and Nathan Aké and Ruben Dias are injured, leaving Guardiola without four frontline defenders. Walker will serve the second match of a three-game suspension during the last-16 second leg against the Portuguese champions after lashing out at André Silva in a final group match which had no significance for City, who had already qualified. City appealed against the punishment, though Guardiola did not agree with this. “He deserved the three-game ban,” the manager said. “When a player does a stupid thing, he deserves. I’m not so kind to Kyle in this kind of action. I’m still so angry with him. “Kyle is so important for us – you saw the game he played against Man United [on Sunday]. But in Leipzig when we had already qualified, 80 minutes in and he made this kind of action? The club appealed but I did not agree. They have to do it because in other similar cases it was just two games [but] he deserved it. Hopefully he learns for the future. “We have just 14 players available. We have a few problems, the suspension for Kyle, João is sick. We are in a little bit of trouble behind, in the back four. Of course we had an incredible result in the first leg, we start 5-0, but it is not done.” Guardiola could opt to field John Stones at right-back, Aymeric Laporte and Fernandinho in central defence and Oleksandr Zinchenko at left-back. Kevin De Bruyne will miss the team’s next European game if booked. “Maybe he will not start,” Guardiola said. Ederson believes City, who are the Premier League leaders and in the FA Cup quarter-finals, can win these competitions and the Champions League to claim the Treble. “Definitely,” the goalkeeper said. “We’re fully capable of meeting this objective.”",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola criticises ‘stupid’ Kyle Walker over Champions League ban,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/08/pep-guardiola-criticises-stupid-kyle-walker-over-champions-league-ban-manchester-city
3/9/2022,"“You’re not special,” Anna Delvey sneers at the reporter covering her story in the Netflix drama series Inventing Anna. The implication is that Delvey, a con artist and convicted felon, is special – and millions of people seem to agree. Inventing Anna has some of the highest ratings in Netflix’s history, with over 400m hours’ worth of views in February; and the real-life Delvey – who goes by her faux-heiress, conwoman name rather than her actual surname, Sorokin – has seen her number of followers on Instagram alone soar from 150,000 to over 800,000 since the series premiered. The streamer’s other top February hit was The Tinder Swindler, which attracted more than 45m views in its first week of release, and hit Netflix’s Top 10 list in 92 countries. Why two shows about con artists – one a fake German heiress and the other the fake scion of an Israeli diamond business – have so captured the world’s attention has spawned a slew of think pieces asking: why do we love – or love to hate – scammers so much? And why now, especially? I think so far we’ve missed the actual heart of the matter: whether we like it or not, social media has turned us all into scammers of varying degrees, as well as victims of the constant scam being perpetrated on us by tech companies. They promise they will connect us to the world – but their core profit-making plan is actually the tracking and selling of our data. Essentially, we live in the age of the scam. Today, online fraud is the most common type perpetrated worldwide, and it has risen sharply during the pandemic. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) received more than 2.8m reports of fraud in 2021, with a loss of $5.8bn (£4.4bn) to American consumers – an increase of more than 70% over 2020. In the UK, more than £750m was lost to scammers during the first half of 2021, an increase of 30%, according to UK Finance. The FTC reports that most scams start on social media, which was “more profitable to scammers in 2021 than any other method of reaching people.” It’s curious that people still fall for online con artists, when their scams – the most common being so-called imposter scams, shopping scams and romance scams – have become such a regular feature of online life, widely discussed in the media and documented by the popular reality show Catfish (which premiered in 2012). And yet even digital natives are not immune: young people in the 20-29 age group are the most likely to fall prey to scammers. And a 2019 study by researchers at Stanford reported that most high school students “lacked the skills to judge the reliability of information online”. Could it be because growing up on social media has diminished their ability to tell real from fake? You can’t really blame them, when even some of the most absurd fake news that is published has the carefully designed look of truth. On top of which, most of us are indulging in fake news about ourselves on a fairly constant basis, in the form of doctored pictures, staged personal moments and overblown announcements about our lives and careers. Not to mention the fake followers that some users, influencers and businesses purchase to pump up their online presence. The culture of social media has normalised fakeness at a time when authenticity is supposedly so prized. It’s disheartening as well as ironic that some people laughed at the women who fell victim to the Tinder Swindler, Shimon Hayut – or Simon Leviev as he was known to his victims – and called them “dumb” for falling for his professions of love and promises of marriage. But isn’t that similar to the con that dating app companies run on their users? Their marketing suggests we’ll find the loves of our lives on these services, prompting us to pay for extra features in order to find them faster. And yet, according to a 2020 study by the Pew Research Center, only 39% of online dating users have ever found marriage or long-term relationships on these platforms. Meanwhile, a reported 45% of women have received a dick pic while using a dating app. Leviev and Delvey both lured in their victims with promises of entry into a world of wealth and glamour, of private jets and yachts, designer goods and tables at the hottest restaurants and clubs – promises they made, in part, through Instagram pictures of themselves allegedly living this life. It was the lifestyle they themselves longed to have, and managed to get through scamming their marks. Watching their stories unfold reminded me of something said to me by Nick Prugo, one of the members of the Bling Ring, a group of teenage thieves who, in 2008 and 2009, robbed the homes of celebrities including Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan, and whose story I covered for Vanity Fair. “It’s the lifestyle that everybody kind of wants,” Prugo said. This actually wasn’t always the case, but for many people, it is now – even more so with the pressure people feel from social media and its constant promotion of the lavish lifestyles of influencers. Studies have shown that people compare their own, less affluent lives to the likes of Kim Kardashian and feel low self-esteem because of it; young people are especially vulnerable. But, in a vicious cycle, that decrease in self-esteem only seems to feed a stronger thirst: a 2019 study reported that Gen Z considers wealth and fame even more important to their lives than millennials, who have long been the poster children for these obsessions. There are more shows about scammers to come; Hollywood seems to have deemed our appetite insatiable. The most recent is Hulu’s The Dropout, a miniseries starring Amanda Seyfried as the Theranos fraudster, Elizabeth Holmes, which premiered earlier this month. Holmes, convicted of criminal fraud in January, is awaiting sentencing; Delvey spent nearly four years in prison and is now in US immigration custody for overstaying her visa. But Leviev is running around free – he was even still on Tinder until The Tinder Swindler came out and the dating service finally kicked him off – and wants to tell his side of the story. No doubt somebody in Hollywood will want to hear it. And maybe we will, too.

3/9/2022,"Britain could learn from Japan’s response to the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster by reducing energy consumption to deal with soaring global gas prices after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, academics have said. Suggesting a coordinated response to record gas prices could help ease the pressure on households, experts told MPs on the Commons business committee that steps to reduce national demand for gas-fired power next winter could be deployed. Michael Bradshaw, a professor of global energy at the University of Warwick, said lessons could be learned from Japan, where the government launched a national movement to cut energy usage after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident. He also said Britain could look to the 1970s, when campaigns to reduce energy consumption were run in the UK in response to the oil price shocks triggered by the Yom Kippur war. “Perhaps we need to learn the lessons of the past,” he told MPs in response to questions about the UK’s energy security after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “We do need to think of ways of building resilience going into next winter where people can make adjustments. They have got summer to do it – but more importantly they understand how their heating system works and what measures they can take to turn it down and save money.” Tokyo ran a media campaign called Setsuden (power saving) after the Fukushima disaster, calling for neon lights to be switched off, trains to run slower and households to cut their energy consumption. In the UK a campaign called Save it ran during the 1970s, to highlight energy waste, while the late former Conservative cabinet minister Patrick Jenkin achieved notoriety as a shadow energy minister by urging Britons to brush their teeth in the dark to save electricity. Experts have warned soaring gas prices amid the conflict in Ukraine will drive up household energy costs later this year, contributing to the worst squeeze on living standards since the mid-70s. Bradshaw said families could be encouraged to turn down their boilers or turn off radiators. Last week the International Energy Agency suggested Europeans could turn down their thermostats by a degree, as part of a 10-point plan to save on gas and reduce dependency on Russian imports. “It’s a case of ‘support Ukraine, lag your loft’,” Doug Parr, the chief scientist and policy director at Greenpeace UK, told the MPs on Tuesday. He suggested that more could be done to insulate homes and invest in renewable energy to boost Britain’s resilience against energy shocks. However, the experts dismissed suggestions from backbench Conservatives that embracing fracking could help offset the impact of soaring gas prices and reduce dependency on Russian energy. “Its time has passed,” Bradshaw said. “We had a conversation. At the moment there is no way that it really should be part of our discussions because it can’t deliver in time.” The British Geological Survey estimated in 2013 that between 23.3tn and 64.6tn cubic metres of shale gas could be in place in the north of England. However, Bradshaw said the potential was wildly different from the amount that could be physically extracted, while it would take years to achieve commercial production. “Although we hear of 50 years of gas beneath the ground, that’s the gas-in-place estimate. If you ask me what’s the current level of reserves of shale gas in the UK, the answer is zero, because we’ve not gone through an exploration programme,” he said. “I simply don’t see that the industry can gain the pace and scale to make a material difference. It makes far more sense to accelerate measures that get us off fossil fuels.” Jack Sharples, a research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said it would take a long time to reduce the UK’s reliance on fossil fuels but that a focus on renewables would help increase the country’s energy sovereignty. “We cannot control wholesale prices so instead we need to focus our efforts on how we adapt and cope with those prices, rather than trying to control them [in the short term],” he said.",News/Business,UK energy crisis: MPs urged to learn from Fukushima response,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/uk-energy-crisis-mps-fukushima
3/9/2022,"For much of the 15-plus years Islabikes has existed, the UK company’s managing director Tim Goodall recalls, adults with dwarfism would regularly get in touch, asking to come in to try out one of the bikes they make for children. The company, he said, was happy to oblige, if aware of the implications: “It was the best option out there, but it was still pretty awful. It did feel like it was a problem that could be solved through better design.” And that, in the end, is what has happened. The Ludlow-based business has become the first bike manufacturer in the world to mass-produce models specifically designed for the requirements of people with disproportionate dwarfism. The final result, which took several years of work and various incarnations, was developed in association with the Dwarf Sports Association (DSA), which campaigns to make sports and activity more accessible. Delays included finding a manufacturer who could produce steel tubes strong enough to support the frame, which has an ultra-low, step-through design. People with disproportionate dwarfism, or achondroplasia, tend to have similar-sized torsos to people without the condition but shorter arms and legs, meaning that traditional-shaped bikes will not work – for example, even if a child’s bike is the correct height it will be too cramped for length. Steve Scott from the DSA worked closely with Islabikes over the design. This included a weekend riding his own bike, a bespoke-built model, with the company’s founder, Isla Rowntree, so she could see what worked for him and what did not. “Islabikes stayed with us, and they got it right,” Scott said. “You can’t just lop bits off, which is what my dad used to do when I was a kid, which is great when there’s nothing else, because the proportions are different.” While Scott stuck with cycling, in part because of the efforts of his father, he said many other people with dwarfism found it too hard, or simply could not afford a custom-built model. “That’s the sad thing about trying to cycle for dwarfs. If you can’t find a bike you give up. You can’t just walk into a bike shop and say, ‘Can I have a bike that fits me?’” The two models made by the company, with 20-inch and 24-inch wheels, are aimed at adults with disproportionate dwarfism, with the smaller one also usable for older children. For younger children it offers amended versions of existing children’s bikes – the disproportion of torso to limbs tends to be less pronounced before adolescence. As well as the special frame, the adult bikes have design elements such as shorter cranks, handlebars that curve back slightly and brakes designed for use with smaller fingers. Goodall said that as far as he knew, the company’s new bikes were a world-first. Aside from bespoke models, the only other option was one US manufacturer, which built bikes to order for people with dwarfism, but with long lead times. He said there had already been strong interest from around the world. While the company, which sells its bikes from its website, normally ships only to Europe, for these models it will do so worldwide. Islabikes’ models for children are known for their durability, but also for their relatively high cost, and the new models for people with dwarfism cost £900 each – although the price tag is still much less than that of a bespoke machine. The company is known also for its social conscience, with other projects including a range of children’s bikes designed to be rented and, when outgrown, renovated by the company and re-sold, reducing waste. In 2019 it launched a range of bikes aimed at older riders, also with low, step-through frames. Goodall said he hoped that with the bikes for people with dwarfism the company would at least break even, but that even if it did not, the project was worthwhile. “I’d be loath to describe it as a social enterprise, even if it never does make any money for us,” he said. “It doesn’t sit comfortably with me. How would we like to be described as a charitable cause because of the physical attributes we were born with?”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘You can’t just lop bits off the bike’: UK firm debuts bicycle for people with dwarfism,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/08/you-cant-just-lop-bits-off-uk-firm-debuts-bike-for-people-with-dwarfism
3/9/2022,"A Ukrainian mother and daughter fleeing the war finally arrived on UK soil on Monday evening, after more than a week of grappling with visa problems with British officials in France. Before the family could reach the UK, Oksana Voloshchuk, 40, whose husband is a British citizen of Ukrainian heritage and a former London bus driver, and the couple’s daughter Veronika Voloshchuk, 15, were twice detained by UK Border Force officials in Calais, made eight trips to the UK visa processing centre in Paris, two trips to the British consulate there and one trip to the British embassy. They spent five nights in a hotel in Paris waiting for the visas to be processed and after running short of money spent three nights at a farm and chateau in Burgundy thanks to the kindness of the owner. Veronika has Type 1 diabetes and her father, Yakiv Voloshchuk, said the stress of spending more than a week in France trying to obtain the visas caused worrying spikes in her blood sugar levels. He has disabilities following a stroke more than a decade ago. Yakiv left his London home the day after the war started on 25 February and drove to Ukraine’s border with Poland to rescue his wife and daughter. Reuniting with them on the edge of a war zone appeared more straightforward than obtaining the UK visas. He travelled from the UK to France by ferry, explained to immigration officials in Dover that he was rescuing family members from a war zone and asked what paperwork would be needed to bring his family into the UK. He said he was told none would be needed and that the family should simply present themselves to officials in Calais after he had reunited with them. The family did this on 27 February but were told by UK immigration officials that Oksana and Veronika would be refused permission to enter the UK. Both were detained for five hours. They were detained a second time on Monday (7 March) for just over an hour even though by this time the mother and daughter had their visas in their passports. They were temporarily detained under what is known as IS81, which gives immigration officers “authority to detain for further examination”. “In Paris they said to fill in an online form, but we got to the bit where they were asking for £2,200 per person for medical insurance and could get no further. So we went to the British embassy to ask for help. I showed my British passport but the embassy said they couldn’t do anything to help and we were in the wrong place,” said Yakiv. “Then we went to the British consulate. Here we found the only helpful British person we had come across. He gave us €50 so we could take a taxi to a hotel and he called the visa section to ask them to help us fill in the form.” The Voloshchuks were put in touch with Sarah Preston, an English woman living in Burgundy, who has been helping Ukrainians fleeing the war find accommodation. The family was put up by Michel Guyot who owns the Château de Saint-Fargeau in Burgundy, which has a farm and guest accommodation. “Everyone in Poland and France was wonderful to Ukrainians. We are not coming by choice but because of war and we are not coming to collect benefits. I have a house where my family can stay. Once my daughter has learned English she can go to school and my wife can work,” said Yakiv. Oksana said: “People are being shuttled back and forth between Calais and Paris. Why not set up two computers and five people in Calais to check biometric passports and issue visas. There are people with no money, no car, with babies, being pushed back and forth.” Yakiv said that while the family was happy to now be together and safe in the UK, they were all deeply traumatised by the war and scanning the news every minute. Their experience with the British authorities in Paris had compounded that trauma. “The treatment we received from the French and the British has been so different. The French were so lovely. I can’t understand why the British could do nothing to help us.” A government spokesperson said: “We are working to process applications as quickly as possible and submitting an application in English reduces delays, which means we can get people here more efficiently. However, if someone is unable to provide translated documents they should still submit their application with untranslated documents. Support is available to applicants through our free 24/7 helpline and in visa application centres.”",News/World news,Ukrainian family describe trauma of UK visa processing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/ukrainian-family-describe-trauma-of-uk-visa-processing
3/9/2022,"From Mykolaiv along the coast via the already captured city of Kherson to the besieged city of Mariupol, the Russian advances in the south of Ukraine have contrasted with the difficulties Moscow has experienced in the north and north-east – in particular in the efforts to encircle the capital, Kyiv. The contrasts between the southern and northern fronts are likely to have profound consequences, weighing heavily on any future peace negotiations, with likely effects that are economic, diplomatic and political as well as military. Nature has fortified Mykolaiv. Built on a series of looping river bends where the Southern Bug empties into a large inlet of the Black Sea, the shipbuilding centre forms the apex triangle of key ports with Kherson to the east and Odesa to the west. Easier to defend than to attack, in the days since the Russian invasion of Ukraine reached its outskirts, there have been pitched battles as the city’s airport has changed hands, and as the city’s defenders have manned their barricades, smoke curling above the river from Russian strikes. So far Mykolaiv has held out under the leadership of its charismatic governor, Vitaliy Kim, whose updates on social media have rivalled those of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in their cheerful insouciance. But on Tuesday it appeared Russian forces were looking to bypass the city to the north and find another way across the river. The attempt to skirt Mykolaiv and move on to link up a land bridge with Russian “peacekeeping” forces in the breakaway Transnistria region of Moldova would cut off Ukraine’s most important port, Odesa, by both land and sea. An update from the Institute for the Study of War paints the most recent picture of Russia’s ambitions in the south. “Russian troops are likely attempting to bypass Mykolaiv and cross the Southern Bug upriver of that city to permit an advance on Odesa that will combine with an impending amphibious operation against that city … and are driving north from Crimea toward the city of Zaporizhzhia.” The importance of what has been happening in the south was described by the recently retired Australian general and author Mick Ryan in a long Twitter thread. “The southern theatre of the war is a vital element of the overall Russian campaign design for Ukraine,” wrote Ryan. “[It] contains Ukraine’s 13 seaports, which in 2021 exported over 150 million tons of cargo. This represents 60% of exports & 50% of imports for Ukraine. “And while the war in the north and east has settled into a slow moving and grinding war of attrition, the war in the south has been the location of more operational success for the invading Russian forces.” Ryan identifies a number of issues to explain why the Russian campaign has been more successful in the south. They include “a significant overmatch of Russian ground forces in the south” compared with Ukrainian forces, overstretched Ukrainian defences across the country, and the fact it is logistically easier to resupply troops from established Russian bases in the Rostov-Krasnodar region over the border. “Why have the Russians in the south generally been more successful than those in the north-east and north?” wrote Ryan. “The defence of Kyiv is the strategic main effort for Ukraine. It is their capital, and has significant political, logistic, and cultural value.” “Finally,” he added, “and this is purely speculation, the leadership and campaign planning in the south appears to be superior to the north. While often advancing on diverging axes, the southern theatre has largely continued without the long pauses seen in the north and north-east.” While the fall of Kyiv – or its negotiated capitulation – is a key Russian war aim, a limited Russian victory in the south alone would still have massive implications for Ukraine. As well as creating a devastating economic stranglehold on the country, it would also limit any western aid flows into Ukraine, while threatening the country’s integrity from three broad geographical directions with Russia likely to claim southern areas it has control of in any future peace negotiations. Most worrying of all for Ukraine, perhaps, is what control of the south would mean for the war in other parts of the country, with fears that Russian forces could link up with Russians operating south of Kharkiv or ultimately breakout north towards Dnipro, the key strategic city on the Dnieper River. In the north the Russian offensive remained more complex on Tuesday. While some analysts and western intelligence agencies have described the Russian advance in the north as “stalled” there has also been evidence since the weekend of preparations for a renewed assault on Kyiv and regrouping of Russian forces around the capital city, including attempts – opposed by Ukrainian forces – to advance west towards Kyiv from the direction of Sumy. Russian forces have also hit a number of key logistics centres and an air defence centre that could support Kyiv’s defence, including the Vinnytsia airbase, which it hit with eight cruise missiles, as well as a number of fuel depots. In outlying areas of Kyiv such as Bucha and Irpen, close to the biggest concentration of gathering Russian forces, residents have been forced to flee under a steady rain of shells and rockets. “We can’t even gather up the bodies because the shelling from heavy weapons doesn’t stop day or night,” said the mayor, Anatol Fedoruk. “Dogs are pulling apart the bodies on the city streets. It’s a nightmare.” Through it all, Zelenskiy said, Ukrainian forces were showing unprecedented courage.“The problem is that for one soldier of Ukraine, we have 10 Russian soldiers, and for one Ukrainian tank, we have 50 Russian tanks,” he told ABC News in an interview that aired Monday night. But he noted that the gap in strength was closing and that even if Russian forces “come into all our cities”, they will be met with an insurgency. One of the most pessimistic commentators on Ukraine’s ability to withstand Russia’s attack against it has been Bill Roggio, editor of the Long War Journal, who reflected part of that message. “The fundamental problem the Ukrainian military faced from the very beginning,” he wrote this week, “is that it doesn’t have enough forces to defend everything at once. “The Russians have a numerical advantage and are willing to trade soldiers and hardware to achieve its objectives.”",News/World news,Focus on Kyiv deadlock obscures Russia’s success in south Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/kyiv-deadlock-contrasts-russia-worrying-south-ukraine-war-progress
3/9/2022,"A major infrastructure project harnessing the vast tidal power of the Severn estuary is back on the agenda after the UK government said the Russian invasion of Ukraine had highlighted the need to find more secure sources of energy. An independent commission was launched on Tuesday to explore using the Severn estuary, which has the second largest tidal range in the world, to create energy. Michael Gove, the UK secretary of state for levelling up, backed the commission, which comes 12 years after the government dashed ambitious plans for a 10-mile energy-generating barrage. Gove said: “Russia’s invasion has served to heighten concerns about energy security and costs. Sustainable forms of energy cannot come soon enough. The launch of an independent commission on tidal energy for the Severn is very welcome news.” The commission has been set up by the Western Gateway “powerhouse”, a coalition of politicians, business and public sector leaders and academics covering an area stretching from Swansea to Swindon and straddling the Severn, designed to rival the Northern Powerhouse and Midlands Engine. At its inaugural conference, delegates were told a Severn estuary tidal project could provide up to 7% of the UK’s energy needs. Huw Thomas, the leader of Cardiff council and one of the leaders of the project said: “We’re becoming painfully aware of the need for greater energy security.” Thomas acknowledged that concerns over possible damage to an internationally important marsh and mudflat habitat, harming wildlife had blighted previous schemes. In 2010 the UK government said there was no “strategic case” for investing in a barrage and, instead, paved the way for new nuclear power plants. But Thomas said: “The changing landscape of the climate emergency, energy insecurity, rising costs, and rapid technological improvements, indicate that many of these policy, cost and environmental barriers may no longer be as significant.” Thomas said the powerhouse was not wedded to any particular technology but he said the possibility of a barrage – which is likely to cost more than £25bn and take 10 years or more to come to fruition – or tidal lagoons would be explored. Vaughan Gething, the Welsh government’s economy minister, told the conference it was committed to helping Wales become a leading centre for emerging tidal technology. The leader of Newport city council, Jane Mudd, said: “It feels like the time is right to look at this again.” She said it was exciting that people on both sides of the estuary could work on the project. “The Severn is something that can unite us rather than divide us.”",News/Environment,Severn estuary tidal energy plan back on agenda amid Ukraine crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/08/severn-estuary-tidal-energy-plan-back-on-agenda-amid-ukraine-crisis
