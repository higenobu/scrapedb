MPs listened to Zelensky’s speech at 5 pm local time via a live translation. It was the first time a foreign leader has addressed MPs in the chamber, according to the BBC. “We do not want to lose what we have, what is ours, our country, Ukraine, just in the same way as you once didn’t want to lose your country when the Nazis started to fight your country,” Zelensky said, according to the translation. Zelensky echoed a wartime speech by Winston Churchill in his address, asserting Ukrainians will fight in the forests and streets and adding, “We will not give up, and we will not lose.” Zelensky thanked Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his support and said, ""Please increase the pressure of sanctions against this country and please recognize this country as a terrorist state,” Zelensky said, adding: “Please make sure our Ukrainian skies are safe. Please make sure you do what needs to be done and what is stipulated by the greatness of your country.” Credit: Parliament TV via Storyful",Politics/Storyful,"Ukrainian President Receives Standing Ovation From British Parliament, Echoes Churchill in Speech",https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-president-receives-standing-ovation-182632004.html
