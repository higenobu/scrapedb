12/15/2021,"The University of Utah State's police chief told football players this year that they should beware of having sex with women who are members of the LDS church because those women may end up telling their bishops that the sex wasn't consensual. A recording of police chief Earl Morris was obtained by the Salt Lake Tribune and published as part of a story detailing a student's Title IX lawsuit against the school. In the recording, there is laughter after Morris tells players that a Mormon woman could end up feeling like she regrets having premarital sex and report the encounter as a sexual assault to a church leader. From the Tribune: USU police Chief Earl Morris warned the team that LDS women will often tell their bishop, when questioned about it, that sex was nonconsensual because it’s “easier.” They might be “feeling regret,” he continued, for having sex before marriage, which goes against the faith’s teachings of abstinence, so they’ll say it was assault. “And if you’re not used to a Mormon community, folks, I’m here to tell you, the Latter-day Saints community ... young ladies, they may have sex with you, but then they’re going to go talk to their minister, their bishop, priest, whatever you want to call it,” Morris said during a team meeting as the school year began — according to a recording recently obtained by The Salt Lake Tribune. Members of the team laughed and hollered in response to Morris’ comments. The campus police chief then told the players that no matter what prompts it, if they’re accused of assault, his officers are forced to investigate. And, he added, “the cards are stacked against you from the moment that happens.” In a statement to the Tribune, Utah State said that it hadn't heard a full recording of Morris' comments but that ""it is important to USU that our messaging and trainings reflect the university’s efforts to prevent sexual misconduct, reduce barriers to reporting, and respond to it appropriately when it occurs. The transcribed statements, as presented by the Tribune, are not consistent with the university’s trainings on this matter."" The must-read Tribune story details a Title IX suit filed this week by Kaytriauna Flint. She says in her suit that the school systemically protects football players from sexual assault claims and cites a 2019 alleged sexual assault as proof of that.  Flint said she was raped by a football player in 2019 and saw a doctor in Montana the next day after she had traveled home on a scheduled trip. A university Title IX investigation into her accusation was ultimately dismissed this November after an initial ruling said it was more likely than not that Flint was raped by the football player.  Flint says in her suit that USU president Noelle Cockett ruled in December of 2020 that the player didn’t have enough opportunity to appeal the decision in Flint’s favor and the case was re-opened. Cockett’s decision to re-open the case came nearly 10 months after the Department of Justice said the school had mishandled cases of sexual assault on campus and failed to investigate others. The three-year investigation noted that the school received over 200 reports of sexual harassment from 2013-18 and fewer than 25 went through the proper Title IX procedures. Assault allegations against members of the football team in that time period were also included in the DOJ report. The report said the school got over 15 allegations of sexual assault by football players in that period and multiple players were accused of sexual misconduct on more than one occasion. However, the report said it wasn't uncommon for cases against football players to be closed not long after they were opened.  In 2019, former Utah State player Torrey Green was convicted of six different rape charges and a sexual battery charge dating back to his time at Utah State. Green sexually assaulted six women from 2013-15 when he played for Utah State Investigations into the first accusations against Green didn't go far until they were published by the Tribune. After the paper wrote about handling of four accusations against Green, other women came forward to say that they had been raped by him.  ",U.S./Yahoo Sports,Utah State police chief told football team to be wary of premarital sex with Mormon women,https://news.yahoo.com/utah-state-police-chief-told-football-team-that-mormon-women-may-regret-premarital-sex-and-report-it-as-a-sexual-assault-221833161.html
12/15/2021,"The first person in US to receive a COVID-19 vaccine said healthcare workers are ""tired."" New York nurse Sandra Lindsay made the remarks on the one-year anniversary of her shot. Lindsay said more must be done to get people vaccinated as new variants like Omicron emerge. The first person in the US to receive a COVID-19 vaccine exactly one year ago said on Tuesday that healthcare workers are ""tired"" and ""concerned"" as the pandemic drags on, CNN reported. Sandra Lindsay, a nurse in New York, was the first person to get vaccinated against COVID-19 outside of clinical trials on December 14, 2020, at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center. Lindsay said she looks back with ""tremendous gratitude"" that she was able to get vaccinated. But, she added: ""I can speak on behalf of health care workers at my organization when I say that we are tired, and we're concerned, especially because we know that the public now has options,"" she said. Last year's milestone kicked off a nationwide vaccination campaign in the US, with over 485 million doses administered across the country, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fully vaccinated people make up 60.9% of the population — or over 202 million people — according to the CDC, though that figure includes children who were unable until recently to get the shots. Over 72% of Americans over the age of 18 have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. ""Although we've made some progress, we still have some way to go,"" Lindsay told CNN. ""My hope is that here as Americans and around the world, we can unite to finally put an end to the pandemic."" But the one-year anniversary of the historic jab comes as the nation faces an increasing presence of the new Omicron variant, which was first detected in the US on November 15, according to the CDC. Health officials such as CDC Director Rochelle Walensky have urged people to get vaccinated and boosted, saying that while Omicron may appear to be less severe, a fresh wave of COVID-19 cases would mean ""a lot of people"" will get sick.

12/15/2021,"We can't tout the benefits of strength training enough: it can help you burn calories, build lean muscle, boost metabolism, and even sleep better. And while it's important to find the right weight to challenge yourself, you can't stick to the same set of dumbbells and sets forever if you want to see progress. This is where progressive overload comes into play. ""Progressive overload is a gradual increase in the amount one lifts during resistance training,"" explained ACSM-certified personal trainer Jim White, RDN, owner of Jim White Fitness and Nutrition Studios. Over time, your body adapts to handling a certain amount of resistance, so increasing the load on the body - through an increase in weight, reps, or sets - will result in strength and muscle improvements. ""When it comes to lifting weights, the reason people don't make progress is because they don't challenge themselves,"" Eric Bowling, an NASM-certified personal trainer, told POPSUGAR. They are sometimes scared to lift heavier because they don't want to injure themselves. ""If you want to make progress, it's going to require pushing your limits and enduring a degree of pain,"" he said. (Note: however, consult your doctor if the pain you feel is severe.) Related: Make Your Workouts Harder Without Weights by Adding This Simple Step to Exercises If you're not quite sure where to begin with lifting weights, use this guide to decide how heavy your weights need to be. White said to do the following: Start out with a lighter yet challenging weight that you can lift for three sets of 10 to 12 reps. The next time you work out (or in a couple of sessions), add five pounds to the weight so you can only do three sets of eight reps. Once you progress and can do three sets of 10 to 12 reps with this weight, it's time to go even heavier. He added that it's important not to go too heavy so as not to compromise form or result in injury. And while increasing weight is one way to implement progressive overload, Bowling said there are other variables you can change: reps, sets, weight, tempo (the speed during the movement), total time under tension, range of motion, and rest time. ""This constant manipulation to key variables is the advantage weight training has over traditional cardio,"" he said, adding that this is why weight training is key for fat loss. If you feel like you hit a plateau, try the same workout but change one of the variables: decrease rest, add a set, or do more reps. Once you feel like you could do an exercise for unlimited reps or do 10 sets without breaking a sweat, then it's time to challenge yourself.

And if you are looking for a plan to help guide you, here's a four-week training schedule that incorporates progressive overload.
