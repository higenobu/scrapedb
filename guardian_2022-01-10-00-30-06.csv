1/10/2022,"With just a week to go, the Guardian and Observer charity appeal in support of causes tackling the impact of the climate crisis and extreme weather has raised more than £760,000. More than 7,000 people have so far donated to the appeal, which will be shared between four charities: Practical Action, Global Greengrants Fund UK, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, and Environmental Justice Foundation.  The theme this year is climate justice, inspired by stories of people and communities uprooted by climate volatility, whether flooding, wildfire, melting ice or drought, and raising money for charities working with those most affected by environmental loss. The appeal has struck a chord with many readers, who in hundreds of messages left via the appeal donation website told us they believe tackling the climate emergency is one of the most urgent – if not the most urgent – issues facing the planet. Many said social justice must be at the heart of measures to address global heating – with the world’s wealthiest countries (also the biggest polluters) having a moral responsibility to pay for measures to protect the environment in the world’s poorest areas, which are worst-hit by climate-induced extreme weather. One donor, Rebecca McCutcheon, said: “Supporting vulnerable people to adapt and protect themselves from the devastating changes happening now is a positive act in the face of shameful inaction on the parts of businesses and governments. In truth it is not a charitable donation but an attempt to invest in our global, shared future.” Steve Trent, the chief executive of the Environmental Justice Foundation, said: “I would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the Guardian and Observer readers, their generous donations will enable us to continue our work using high-level advocacy, field investigations and powerful films to drive forward climate justice. “ He added: “Climate action has never been more crucial, and time is running out. Yet we do not need to lose hope: we have the solutions and the wherewithal to implement them. If our governments act now, with greater urgency and ambition, we can achieve a true transformation to an equitable, fairer, sustainable world.” Introducing the appeal in December, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, wrote: “The stark truth is that the world’s developing countries have seen the vast majority of the death and destruction caused by climate-induced disasters, and yet they are responsible for a tiny fraction of global emissions.” The appeal closes at midnight on Sunday 16 January.",News/Society,"More than £760,000 raised for Guardian and Observer charity appeal",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/09/more-than-760000-raised-for-guardian-and-observer-charity-appeal
1/10/2022,"The Home Office has told a Syrian asylum seeker he can return to the country he fled during the war because it is safe to do so, in what is thought to be the first case of its kind. The 25-year-old asylum seeker sought sanctuary in the UK in May 2020. He fled forcible conscription into Bashar al-Assad’s army in 2017, saying that he would have been forced to kill other Syrians. He said that if he is forced back to Syria he will be targeted as a draft evader, arrested, detained and killed.  Until now, the UK has not returned refugees who opposed President Assad’s regime because of the dangers still present in a nation torn asunder by the continuing civil war. But the Guardian has seen a refusal letter sent to the man by the Home Office in December, in which officials said: “I am not satisfied to a reasonable degree of likelihood that you have a well-founded fear of persecution.” While the Home Office has accepted he did flee forced conscription, the refusal letter adds: “It is not accepted that you will face a risk of persecution or real risk of serious harm on return to the Syrian Arab Republic due to your imputed political opinion as a draft evader.” The asylum seeker, who is not named for his own protection, said: “I escaped from Syria in 2017 and I am looking for safety. “My solicitor is appealing against the Home Office decision and says this is the first Syrian asylum refusal case she has seen. I hope I will not be forced back to Syria. I am so tired of trying to find somewhere that I can be safe.” The charity Refugee Action expressed alarm at the Home Office’s decision. Mariam Kemple Hardy, its head of campaigns, said the decision “beggars belief”, and “implored” the home secretary, Priti Patel, to overturn the decision. She added: “Frankly, if this government is no longer granting sanctuary to Syrian refugees, who will it grant sanctuary to? This decision pulls up the drawbridge to those fleeing war and persecution. It fails to meet even the bare minimum anyone would expect of a government claiming to uphold its obligations on the world stage.” No other European country is forcibly returning refugees to Syria because it is a conflict zone. However, to the dismay of human rights organisations worldwide, Denmark has been detaining some Syrian refugees who refuse to return to their home country voluntarily. According to a report in the Mail on Sunday, about 1,200 Syrian refugees out of 35,000 living in Denmark are affected by a tough new policy from the government to return them to their home country, as of November last year. The scheme is being challenged by the refugees’ lawyers. A report from Human Rights Watch in October 2021 said that refugees should not be returned to Syria. By examining the fate of those who returned voluntarily, it found that they faced grave human rights abuses and persecution at the hands of the Syrian government and affiliated militias – including torture, extra-judicial killings and kidnappings. A Home Office spokesperson said: “All asylum applications are considered on their individual merits on a case-by-case basis and in line with current published policy.”",News/UK news,Home Office tells Syrian asylum seeker he can return safely,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/09/home-office-tells-syrian-asylum-seeker-he-can-return-safely
1/10/2022,"The 6-0 scoreline and the sheer ruthlessness of Manchester City’s defeat of Brighton has kicked the troubled club’s 2022 off in style, but it is the return to action of Lucy Bronze and Steph Houghton that will matter more. They were forced to sit out the majority of the first half of the season but the return of the England duo is a sign that the end of a catastrophic injury crisis, during which Gareth Taylor’s job as manager has appeared to be in danger, is in sight. “We’re making steady progress now,” Taylor said. “We need to back this performance up with another one. One game at a time.”  City have five wins in their opening 10 games but, crucially, four wins from their past five, and are building some momentum. Brighton played their part in the emphatic City win, though, and were very much the architects of their own downfall after a solid first half was undone in the space of seven second-half minutes. Despite Brighton’s dismal record against Manchester City – they have lost four and drawn one against the visiting team – it says a lot about the development of the south-coast side that the opening Women’s Super League game of 2022 was the pick of the ties on offer. Under the former England manager Hope Powell, Brighton’s steady rise up the WSL table has, to some extent, flown under the radar. Sat in fifth and two points above last year’s runners up City before this match, Brighton have been hard to ignore. The winter break “came at a really good time for us, for players and staff”, Powell said before kick-off against City. They endured back-to-back defeats before Christmas and their slide was halted by the break. Rejuvenated, and strengthened by the arrival from BK Häcken of the Swedish duo Emma Kullberg and Julia Zigiotti Olme, who were both on the bench, the home side coped well in the first half despite City dominating possession. They also were not without chances, with Dan Carter, who joined in the summer from Arsenal, firing just over the crossbar and a volley from Inessa Kaagman both hinting at the threat. Powell had said she wanted her team to play on the front foot and, playing a higher line, in the second half they went on the hunt. That change, though. left them woefully exposed, and City were ready to take advantage thanks to the blistering pace of Bronze and the wide forwards Lauren Hemp and Hayley Raso. Three minutes after the restart Hemp raced into the box from the left and sent a low cross into the middle that the defender Victoria Williams turned into her own net with Ellen White lurking nearby. Two minutes later City doubled their lead, a ball over the top from Alex Greenwood finding the run of Hemp who chipped the ball neatly over the goalkeeper Megan Walsh. In another two minutes it was three. Bronze’s pulled back ball ricocheted around the area, Brighton failed to clear, and Stanway passed it into the net. The fourth goal was perhaps the most bruising: Walsh’s rolled ball was nicked off the feet of the intended recipient, Danielle Bowman, by Coombs, who powered it into the top corner from the edge of the box. Buoyed by the goals and the return of Bronze and the club captain Houghton, the latter entering the fray with the game all but over, City ruthlessly toyed with Brighton and looked every inch the team that vied for the title with Chelsea last season. The fifth came when another ball over the top put Raso in and she powered it home, and the substitute Vicky Losada added the sixth with a chipped effort that flicked off a defender and in. City go above Brighton and into fifth with the win. They are four points off third, and suddenly Champions League football does not look impossible.",Sport/Football,Vicky Losada caps Manchester City’s six-goal second-half blitz at Brighton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/09/vicky-losada-caps-manchester-citys-six-goal-second-half-blitz-at-brighton
1/10/2022,"Authorities in Kazakhstan have said 164 people were killed in the unrest that rocked the country in the past week, including three children. The health ministry said 103 of the deaths were in Almaty, the country’s largest city and the centre of the violence.  After the worst violence in independent Kazakhstan’s 30-year history, the situation in Almaty and other cities was largely calm on Sunday. Authorities said they had recovered control and life would slowly get back to normal in the coming days. In Almaty, authorities announced some public transport would resume on Monday. However, the deputy defence minister, Sultan Gamaletdinov, said on Sunday that a “counterterrorist operation” was still underway and would continue “until the terrorists are completely eliminated and the constitutional order is restored in the Republic of Kazakhstan”. The number of those detained by police continues to rise, with the office of Kazakhstan’s president giving a latest figure of 5,800. The protests began last Sunday in the west of the country, over a steep rise in fuel prices, and quickly spread to Almaty and other cities, driven by years of pent-up frustration. On Wednesday, violent clashes began, with groups of men seizing the airport and storming government buildings. Many on the ground reported that organised, violent groups seemed to take over the protest. On Friday, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev gave a hardline address in which he said he had ordered law enforcement bodies to shoot to kill, without warning, and said Almaty had been attacked by a group of 20,000 “bandits and terrorists”. Erzhan Kazykhan, a presidential adviser, made a video address in English on Sunday, accusing some in the west of misinterpreting the events. “Regretfully peaceful demonstration in Almaty and some other regions were hijacked by perpetrators and both local and external terrorist groups speaking foreign languages,” he said. Authorities have not yet released any evidence to show the involvement of either “terrorists” or foreign forces. On Sunday, local television showed a video confession of a bruised man, who said he had been paid to travel from neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and take part in violence. However, viewers in Kyrgyzstan quickly identified him as a well-known jazz musician who frequently toured Kazakhstan, and expressed doubts he could have been a rioter. Reports of possible infighting within the Kazakhstani elites driving part of the violence appear to be more plausible. Karim Masimov, the head of the security services and a former prime minister, was first removed from office and then arrested during the week on suspicion of treason. No details have been released of what Masimov is alleged to have done. Some sources have pointed to recent disagreements between Tokayev and figures close to his predecessor Nursultan Nazarbayev, who ruled the country from independence in 1991 until 2019 and handpicked Tokayev as his successor. Nazarbayev holds the honorific title of Leader of the Nation, and the country’s capital was renamed Nur-Sultan in his honour in 2019. He was removed by Tokayev as head of the National Security Council this week. Many of the protesters chanted “old man, out!” in reference to Nazarbayev, while in the city of Taldykorgan a statue of him was pulled down. Anger has focused on the considerable wealth amassed by his family and his continuing influence over the political scene. Nazarbayev’s press secretary has claimed the previous president is in the country and is backing Tokayev, but Nazarbayev has not spoken or appeared in public since the unrest began. On Wednesday, Tokayev called on a Russia-led military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) to introduce troops into the country. This was agreed on in a matter of hours, and a force reportedly numbering about 2,500 mostly Russian troops is operating in the country. Tokayev, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and the leaders of the other CSTO nations – Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Tajikistan – are due to hold a video conference on Monday.",News/World news,Kazakhstan says 164 people were killed in week of unrest,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/09/kazakhstan-people-killed-week-unrest
1/10/2022,"The UK’s data watchdog is seeking clarification from Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta about parental controls on its popular virtual reality headset, as campaigners warned that it could breach an online children’s safety code. The Information Commissioner’s Office said it was planning “further discussions” with the Facebook and Instagram owner about its £300 Oculus Quest 2 device, which was a sought-after gift over Christmas. However, child safety experts have warned that the headset’s lack of parental controls – which would allow parents to block content that could be harmful to children – expose young users to the threat of abuse on the platform.  Research by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a campaign group, has flagged multiple instances of abuse on VRChat, a top-selling social app for Oculus users. Examples of under-18s being harassed on VRChat included a young person’s avatar – the digital representation used by people on virtual reality platforms – being followed by two heavily breathing men and another male joking in front of an under-18 that they were a “convicted sex offender”. The ICO said it would contact Meta about the device’s compliance with the age-appropriate design code, also known as the children’s code, which states that the “best interests of the child should be a primary consideration” for online services likely to be accessed by a person under 18. “Online services and products that use personal data and are likely to be accessed by children are required to comply with the standards of our children’s code,” said an ICO spokesperson. “We are planning further discussions with Meta on its children’s privacy and data protection by design approaches to Oculus products and virtual reality services. Parents and children who have concerns about how their data is being handled can complain to us at the ICO.” The code focuses on preventing websites and apps from misusing children’s data and also applies to “connected devices”, but it does not regulate content. A breach of the code could be punished by a fine of up to £17.5m or 4% of a company’s global turnover, which in the case of Meta would be £8bn, although formal warnings and reprimands are also possible. The architect of the children’s code, the crossbench peer Beeban Kidron, said Meta could be challenged under several aspects of the code. For instance, users need to be over 13 to use the Oculus headset – a Facebook account, which has a minimum age of 13, is required to operate it – which could put Meta in breach of the code’s provisions requiring companies to check a user’s age. VRChat, which also has a minimum age requirement of 13, faces similar questions. “The worries about the Oculus VR Headset demonstrate why we need to see ‘safety by design’ as a new norm in tech,” said Kidron. “Kids using VR headsets like Oculus can access chatrooms and other features known to carry risk, by simply ticking a box declaring they meet the minimum age requirements. This is an insufficient barrier to underage use of services known to harbour child abuse, harassment, racism and pornography.” Andy Burrows, the head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC, said there were “substantive” questions about whether Meta was complying with the children’s code. “Immersive virtual environments present an increased risk to children being exposed to harm in different and intensified ways, and it’s clear Meta hasn’t developed the Oculus headset in a way that’s at all consistent with a safety-by-design approach.” Burrows added that the CCDH research raised concerns about Zuckerberg’s plans for the “Metaverse”, a catch-all term for an immersive VR world in which people interact socially and professionally. “If this is the start of Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse it suggests he isn’t committed to building it safely from the outset, and that much-needed lessons still haven’t been learnt,” said Burrows. The CCDH, which said it had found more than 100 potential violations of Meta’s policies over a 12-hour period on VRChat, said Meta was “ignoring the need to embed even minimum protection” for its metaverse plans. “The public has a right to ask how anyone in good conscience could invite people on to a new platform without real confidence it is safe for them,” said Imran Ahmed, the CCDH chief executive. A Meta spokesperson said the company was “confident” that the Oculus headset met the conditions of the children’s code. “We’re committed to meeting the obligations under the code, and to providing young people with age-appropriate experiences,” said the spokesperson, adding that the Oculus terms of service did not permit under-13s to create accounts or use the device. The spokesperson said Meta was also committed to building the Metaverse responsibly and had already announced a $50m (£37m) investment programme to ensure the concept met regulatory and legal concerns, distributing the money among organisations and academic institutions such as Seoul National University and Women in Immersive Tech.
