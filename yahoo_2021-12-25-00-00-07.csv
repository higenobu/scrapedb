12/25/2021,"A family is seeking justice for their loved one featured in a newly released police body camera video that showed Norfolk, Virginia, police tackling a Black bicyclist, Derrick Rountree, for riding around without a headlight nearly three years ago on Christmas Eve. The Virginian-Pilot newspaper obtained the nearly 30-minute police body camera video, which they noted was submitted as an exhibit to the case a few weeks ago by attorney Christina Connell on behalf of Rountree’s family. In a 1:38 minute clip posted to YouTube, Norfolk cop Aaron Nkrumah Christie’s body camera shows him running at full speed toward Rountree, tackling him to the ground. The man is heard asking the cop, “Why you do that?” The audio was muffled, but Rountree asks, “Why you do that to me, bro? I ain’t do nothing.” Christie responds, “You have no light [on your bicycle]. We tried to stop you. You tried to run.” Seemingly shocked, Rountree fired back, “Is you serious, man? I didn’t know you had to have a light for a bike.” Rountree suffered a broken right tibia and fibula due to the tussle. The document stated that he was taken to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital for treatment, where he was hospitalized for several days. According to the outlet, Rountree reportedly rode past a police cruiser on December 24, 2018, at about 9 p.m. The officer briefly sounded the vehicle’s siren, flashed its lights, and said something over a megaphone. However, the 43-year-old, thinking it was for something unrelated to him, kept riding. Soon afterward, he turned around to head back to a friend’s place at the Tidewater Gardens public housing complex where he was staying. That was when Christie sprang into action. Rountree would be charged with a headlight infraction and obstruction of justice, but the obstruction charge was later dismissed. He reportedly was fined $15 for not having a headlight. A lawsuit was filed in December 2020 in the U.S. District Court in Norfolk. Christina claimed her client’s civil rights were violated when officers used excessive force when they stopped him from riding his bike a night because he didn’t have a headlight, which is against the law in Virginia. Christie said the location where Rountree was located — which is noted for its high crime — prompted him to stop the man. When he refused to comply with officers, Christie believed Rountree might be involved in illegal activities. Rountree was killed in a daytime shooting near a Shop ‘N Go market on East Virginia Beach Boulevard this summer. An innocent bystander in the shooting, he was a father of three. Christie was cleared of any wrongdoing and is still on the force. It’s unclear if the investigation into the incident has been completed. The civil case is scheduled to go to trial on March 29.

A handful of watercraft displayed vulgar messages criticizing President Joe Biden during the holiday-themed Cocoa Beach Boat Parade, sparking complaints from spectators and community Facebook arguments. And the Cocoa Beach Rotary Club, which organizes the popular annual event, has publicly pledged to try to prevent similar situations from happening again. “Political messaging has no place in a Christmas parade,"" Cocoa Beach Mayor Ben Malik said. ""We have enough to fight amongst each other about. We don't need to ruin Christmas over it,"" Malik said. Ribbon-cutting ceremony: New Cocoa Beach police station dedicated Upscale food hall: Cocoa Beach mercado with craft brewery proposed with outdoor courtyard, event room A tradition since the 1970s, the Cocoa Beach Boat Parade features a procession of illuminated boats. The festive flotilla started Dec. 11 at Marker 101 near Centennial Park and headed southward along residential canal-front neighborhoods, ending near Cocoa Beach Country Club. Some spectators later complained about profane political flags and light displays via social media and calls and emails to City Hall. Cocoa Beach Rotary Club President Marcin Kubiak addressed the issue in an open letter last week. “It is our understanding that this year a handful of boats — whose captains to the best of our knowledge did not participate in the captains’ meeting held in early December — joined the parade displaying political messages including profanities,” Kubiak's letter said. “We are deeply saddened, disappointed and disgusted this took place,” the letter said. “We are meeting internally to evaluate best approaches to help similar situations from occurring in the future. Cocoa Beach Rotary Club is an apolitical association and our goal is only to make positive impact in our community and beyond,” the letter said. Cocoa Beach City Hall officials posted the Rotary letter on the city Facebook page on Dec. 15, generating hundreds of comments — and arguments over national politics, freedom of speech and common decency. The city of Cocoa Beach does not sponsor the Rotary Club boat parade, though the city police boat leads the procession. ""I feel this was a planned move by a small group of boat owners, to get attention, and they did,"" John Alexander, boat parade chairman, said in an email last week to the Cocoa Beach City Commission. ""Up to this year the big issue was throwing candy off the boats. Now the political division of our nation's people has caused this event to become a focal point of division, which is very sad!"" Alexander said in the email. Addressing the controversy, City Attorney Becky Vose forwarded Malik an analysis of a landmark 1995 Supreme Court decision regarding restriction of parade messaging. In that decision, the judges unanimously ruled that the organizers of the South Boston St. Patrick’s Day Parade had the right to reject the Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston from participating. ""The issue in this case is whether Massachusetts may require private citizens who organize a parade to include among the marchers a group imparting a message the organizers do not wish to convey. We hold that such a mandate violates the First Amendment,"" the Supreme Court said in its opinion.

""But if it's a private civic organization that's doing a parade, they can certainly have rules and regulations in place that would prohibit any type of offensive or political messaging restrictions that they want,"" he said. In 2015, hundreds of people attended Melbourne City Council debate after Confederate flags were displayed during that city's annual Fourth of July parade. Confederate Sons Association of Florida Indian River Camp 47 and Sons of Confederate Veterans Camp J.J. Dickison Camp 1387 drew criticism from some — and applause from others — by flying the flags during Melbourne's parade, which the city co-sponsored by providing in-kind police and traffic engineering services. The Melbourne City Council voted in 2017 to stop using taxpayer dollars to fund parades. The Melbourne Light Parade — which is organized by a small nonprofit — has had funding challenges ever since, and council members may revisit the issue early next year. Alexander said the Cocoa Beach Rotary Club board of directors will meet after the new year to discuss boat-parade policies. ""The problem is, whenever the parade starts anyone can join. It's very unfortunate, because so many kids are there watching,"" Alexander said. ""I've been organizing this boat parade for about the past 10 years now — and we have never, ever had any situation like this occur,"" he said. Cocoa Beach Vice-Mayor Skip Williams watched the boat parade. In replies to emails he received from constituents about the parade, he said the December event has ""always been a family friendly event for all and I feel is not the place for politically disparaging displays."" Williams also wrote that it was not yet clear if those boaters were repeat participants, if they registered for the parade, if they attended the pre-event captains' meeting — or if they just showed up and cut into the parade. ""I have already questioned whether we can regulate and enforce ways to keep this type of thing from reoccurring in Cocoa Beach. God forbid the issue gets tied up in a 1st Amendment legal battle and we have to cancel the parade to make sure it doesn’t happen again,"" Williams said in the emails.
