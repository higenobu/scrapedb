4/8/2022,"The UN-affiliated organisation that oversees deep-sea mining, a controversial new industry, has been accused of failings of transparency after an independent body responsible for reporting on negotiations was kicked out. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) is meeting this week at its council headquarters in Kingston, Jamaica, to develop regulations for the fledgling industry. But it emerged this week that Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB), a division of the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), which has covered previous ISA negotiations, had not had its contract renewed. While the ISA negotiations are filmed live via webcam, the absence of ENB – which would have created a permanent independent record of proceedings – was described as a “huge loss” for stakeholders. Some states, including Germany, are also concerned that the ISA is developing its mining standards and guidelines behind closed doors, and that current knowledge of deep-sea ecosystems and the potential effects of mining on the marine environment are insufficient to allow it to go ahead. Scientists have warned that the damage to ecosystems from mining nickel, cobalt and other metals on the deep-seabed would be “dangerous”, “reckless” and “irreversible”. One estimate suggests that 90% of the deep-sea species that researchers encounter are new to science. As opposition to deep-sea mining grows, the ISA is facing resistance over its rush to develop a roadmap to be adopted before 9 July 2023. The plan was prompted in June last year, when the island of Nauru informed the ISA of its intention to start mining the seabed in two years’ time, via a subsidiary of a Canadian firm, The Metals Company (TMC, until recently known as DeepGreen Metals). This invoked an obscure clause of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which said the ISA must finalise regulations within two years of such an announcement. Google, BMW, Volvo and Samsung SDI, a battery subsidiary of the electronics firm, have joined a World Wildlife Fund call for a moratorium on mining the deep sea, which will affect the potential market for deep-sea minerals used for car and smartphone batteries. The ISA said ENB’s contract was not renewed due to budget cuts. The IISD, meanwhile, said it was now fundraising to be able to cover the next round of negotiations in July. “Transparency of the talks are important, especially for small islands and developing countries who can’t always attend,” said the IISD’s Matthew TenBruggencate. Germany and environmentalists also expressed concern over a lack of transparency by the ISA’s legal and technical commission (LTC), a body charged with developing standards and guidelines for the mining code, which meets behind closed doors. The LTC comprises 30 members. A fifth of them work for contractors for deep-sea mining companies. In its opening remarks on the ISA’s website, Germany highlighted the absence of stakeholders’ comments, or marked-up changes in the LTC’s draft standards and guidelines document. “In order to be transparent and allow for a proper debate, a mark-up document as provided by the facilitator regarding the draft regulation would be very helpful for our negotiations,” it said. “Therefore, we suggest that the council request such a document.” Germany also said the mining code “still lacked binding and measurable normative requirements” for marine protection. It argued that, because the current standards, guidelines and regulations do not yet contain “specific environmental minimal requirements” for measurable pollution, sediment plumes, biodiversity, and noise and light impacts, the code as it stands would not regulate future mining effectively. “The current state of knowledge is, in our view, insufficient to proceed to exploiting mineral resources,” it said. It supported the EU’s formal position that marine minerals “cannot be exploited before the effects of deep-sea mining on the marine environment, biodiversity and human activities have been sufficiently researched, the risks are understood and technologies and operational practices are able to demonstrate that the environment is not seriously harmed, in line with the precautionary principle”. Other states, including Belgium, the Netherlands, Costa Rica and Chile, adopted similarly precautionary approaches, highlighting the gulf in scientific knowledge of the deep sea. On the other hand the UK, which is no longer part of the EU, has been pushing ahead for rapid development of regulations, according to observers. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the UK government was engaging in ISA negotiations to ensure that high environmental standards were adopted in deep-sea mining regulations. “Any ongoing conversations in support of this should not be interpreted as support for deep-sea mining,” a spokesperson said. Duncan Currie, an international lawyer with the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, which is tracking the negotiations, said he was “very concerned” by the various failures of transparency. “There is no transparency of the LTC, who meet behind closed doors. It sounds like an innocuous body, but it is in essence the decision-making body within the ISA.” Currie wants to see a moratorium on deep-sea mining, akin to that set up by the Antarctic protocol. “The whole area of deep-sea mining is a political, scientific and political minefield. There should be a moratorium put in place.” Also missing from the proposed standards and guidelines was the possibility not to continue with mining. Greenpeace, an observer at the talks, called for reform of the ISA’s secretariat, which it accused of bias towards allowing mining to take place, to the detriment of the environment. “There are a herd of elephants in the room,” said Arlo Hemphill, an oceans campaigner for Greenpeace USA. “There’s not enough time to get it right, and there is not the science to get it right.” In a statement in response, the ISA said it was entrusted by its membership, which comprises 167 member states and the EU, to take necessary measures to protect the marine environment from harmful effects that may arise from deep-seabed mineral-related activities, and that regulations governing exploration of the seabed had been adopted. “The challenge now is to make the transition to exploitation, which must reflect best international standards and practices as well as agreed principles of sustainable development,” it said. “The exploitation regulations will be formally adopted once all 168 members of the ISA reach consensus on its content.” “The ISA is committed to ensuring transparency in pursuit of this goal,” it added. “Whilst budget cuts, imposed by the ISA’s members, meant that Earth Negotiations Bulletin’s contract could not be renewed due to the cost, the ISA is streaming the meetings live in six languages to ensure that transparency is maintained.” It said the ISA’s legal and technical commission was comprised of specialists elected by member states: “It is not unusual for technical bodies such as this to meet in private and, in any case, the discussions and recommendations of the commission are publicly recorded in the chair’s report to the council following each meeting”.

4/8/2022,"The Dubai-based owner of P&O Ferries has lost its status as a formal partner in one of the government’s biggest freeport projects, after widespread public anger over the firing without notice of 800 workers last month. Ministers have confirmed that DP World, the Emirati logistics giant behind P&O, no longer had a central role as a “partner” in the Solent freeport after the resignation of its UK commercial director from the scheme’s board last week. It comes after questions in the Lords from the Green party peer Natalie Bennett who had asked the government what plans were being put in place to withdraw any freeport contracts as a result of the sackings. Speaking for the government, Stephen Greenhalgh, a levelling up minister, responded on Wednesday night saying: “On 28 March 2022 DP World resigned from the Solent freeport board and are no longer a partner in the freeport consortium.” The government has come under heavy pressure for its handling of employment rights and the role of DP World in critical UK infrastructure after P&O Ferries fired 800 crew members without consultation last month. The firm’s boss admitted to MPs the company broke the law on giving notice because “no union could accept our proposals”. Last month the Guardian reported that DP World was in line to benefit from at least £50m of UK taxpayer support as part of its key role in the Solent and Thames freeports, leading to questions in parliament from Labour party leader Keir Starmer over the government’s priorities. The funding of £25m per freeport, which is still subject to approval, will be paid to a lead local authority responsible for each of the 12 special tax and customs zones across the UK and is expected to be spent to benefit the entire freeport region. DP World is the operator of the freight container terminal at the Port of Southampton, a part of the Solent freeport. However, it is more heavily involved as a partner in the Thames scheme, where it owns and runs the London Gateway port and logistics park which was designated as one of the government’s freeport tax sites last year. Greenhalgh appeared to suggest in the Lords that the company still had a role as a partner in the Thames project. “The government is continuing to work to understand whether DP World or P&O Ferrymasters are in breach of any of the requirements on them as investors in the Thames freeport,” he told Bennett. Last week DP World’s UK commercial director, Aart Hille Ris Lambers, quit the Solent freeport board amid local pressure, including from Portsmouth council leader Gerald Vernon-Jackson, another of the 11 members on the Solent freeport board. However, details of the end of the company’s role as a partner were not confirmed at the time. Alan Whitehead, the Labour MP for Southampton Test, whose constituency includes the freeport, said it was appropriate that DP World no longer had a formal role on the steering body given its track record on employment rights. “It’s right that they take more of a back seat now. I don’t think it’s just the resignation of a director, the freeport consortium has decided that, and certainly that has my support,” he said. DP World is still the operator of the port of Southampton, an integral part of the Solent freeport as the second-biggest container terminal in the UK. Covering a broad area including the cities of Southampton, Portsmouth and most of the Isle of Wight, the Solent freeport is expected to create 32,000 jobs while adding £3.6bn to the UK economy by boosting international trade. “They’re not about to flee the port or anything, they’ll continue to operate the container terminal. But the freeport develops without their lead involvement. Among other things that’s a better guarantee that the terms and conditions in the freeport are likely to be better respected,” Whitehead said. The government also said last week that Ernst Schulze, chief executive of DP World UK, was no longer part of the government’s post-Brexit trade advisory group created to support global business opportunities.

4/8/2022,"Plans announced by Texas governor Greg Abbott that attempt to send undocumented migrants away from the southern border on buses to Washington were met with bipartisan criticism on Wednesday. Abbott, a Republican, told reporters that the state would respond to the Biden administration’s decision to rescind a hardline Trump-era immigration policy by placing state troopers in riot gear at the border and then putting migrants on buses bound for DC. But shortly after his press conference announcing the new policy, the governor issued a release that significantly softened the plan, clarifying that any transportation out of the state would be done voluntarily and only after an individual had been processed by the Department of Homeland security for release into the US. The plans also includes measures to begin “enhanced safety inspections” of commercial vehicles coming across the Texas border with Mexico, which the governor acknowledged would “dramatically slow” traffic at the border. The botched announcement came after the Biden administration last week said it would rescind Title 42 restrictions at the southern border. The policy, introduced by the Trump administration, allowed border officials the power to remove undocumented migrants under public health guidance before they could claim asylum. 1.7 million people had been removed from the US under the program, the majority under the Biden administration. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] announced the policy would end on 23 May as the White House plans for an increase in irregular arrivals at the border. On Wednesday, Democrats and Republicans condemned Abbott’s announcement. Beto O’Rourke, the former Democratic US congressman, who is running for Texas governor this year as Abbott faces re-election, described the announcement as a “political stunt”. “If Abbott focused on solutions instead of stunts, then Texas could have made some real progress on this issue over the last seven years,” O’Rourke said in a statement. In a statement reported by the Texas Tribune, ACLU of Texas staff attorney Kate Huddleston said: “Any forcible busing of migrants across the country would be outrageous and blatantly unconstitutional. Given that Abbott cannot dictate where people are sent, he has already backpedaled on this heinous plan, announcing that it will be only voluntary.” Meanwhile, Texas Republican state representative Matt Schaefer called the announcement “a gimmick” in a post on social media.",News/US news,Texas governor’s plans to bus migrants to Capitol met with bipartisan criticism,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/07/texas-governor-plans-bus-migrants-washington
4/8/2022,"This April is the 40th anniversary of the start of the Falklands war. Less well known is that it is the 41st anniversary of a final attempt by the British government to concede sovereignty over the islands to the enemy in that war, Argentina. Negotiations in New York were in progress, aimed at securing self-government for the islands under a long lease from Argentina. Had they succeeded, it could have avoided war, resolved an archaic imperial dispute, and brought the islanders peace with their neighbours. This was not to be. The talks ran into opposition both on the islands and on the Tory backbenches in London. At the same time a belligerent military regime under General Galtieri seized power in Buenos Aires and had other ideas. In April 1982, the regime took the islands by force, only to be driven from them by a British taskforce two months later. No peace deal was reached and the Falklands became an embattled fortress in the South Atlantic, with troops, jets and warships on permanent station. The war cost Britain about £2.8bn (£9.5bn in present value) and the islands’ defence costs upwards of £60m annually. In 2012 it was estimated that British taxpayers paid more than £20,000 per islander for defence alone, and approximately one-third of the population worked for the government. Unlike other former colonies such as Gibraltar, relations with the nearest nation-state are thin. Though living in a technically autonomous British overseas territory, the islanders are wholly dependent on Britain. The pre-invasion talks in New York were under the UN’s decolonisation auspices and had been continuing on and off since the 1960s. A high-point in relations had been reached in 1971 with a communications deal negotiated by a talented British diplomat, David Scott. This opened a seaplane link to Argentina, with access to tourists, hospitals, schools and trade. The intention on both sides was gradually to normalise relations prior to a more formal deal. Initially it worked. Islanders took up scholarships at mainland schools and hundreds of Argentinian tourists visited Port Stanley. The confidence did not last. A cheeseparing London objected to the cost of administering the islands and to building an airfield. Argentina lurched into a bellicose neo-Peronist period. There were rows over passports, Argentinian “landings” took place on outer islands, and renewed talks on sovereignty were demanded. These fell to a junior minister in the Callaghan government, Ted Rowlands. Working intensely with the islanders, he in 1977 persuaded them that some compromise was needed, such as a concession of sovereignty to Argentina in exchange for a 99-year or longer leaseback to Britain. There was talk of an additional security guarantee. Rowlands won the islanders’ trust. This initiative was lost with the fall of the Labour government in 1979. Thatcher’s junior minister Nicholas Ridley took over the Falklands brief but lacked Rowlands’ tact. There was by now intense pressure from the Treasury for cuts. A defence review and plans to withdraw HMS Endurance from its South Atlantic patrol suggested to Argentina that Britain was losing interest in the area. Ridley was still set on a deal, but encountered resistance from the fierce pro-islander lobby in parliament. Thatcher was not averse to sovereignty transfer, but was adamant that nothing be done without islander consent. Talks continued, but unknown to either side was that the navy in Buenos Aires was already planning an invasion, “plan Goa”, named after India’s annexation of Portuguese Goa in 1961. This was planned for June, mid-winter in the South Atlantic, but was pre-empted by naval units exploiting the occupation of the neighbouring South Georgia islands by a group of Argentine scrap metal merchants. Fearing a British response, Buenos Aires gambled on a full invasion. Had it held out until June, it is most unlikely Britain would have risked a winter war. At no point in this saga was there any sign from London that Britain was desperate to hang on to the Falklands. The cost was enormous and the dispute was blighting relations with a then resurgent South America. The curse was Thatcher’s grant of a veto to the islanders, who were strongly supported by many in the Tory party, over any agreement with Argentina. After the war, the UN in November 1982 ordered the “decolonisation” talks in New York to resume. They did not and have not done so for 40 years. When in 2013 Buenos Aires did try to reopen negotiations with David Cameron, he hardly dared venture a reply beyond repeating Thatcher’s islander veto. This was to be expressed in their presence at the table in any meeting between Britain and Argentina. Any idea of progress was hopeless: to the Tories, the Falklands had become a monument to the Thatcher era and all it stood for. Last week, the Argentinian foreign minister, Santiago Cafiero, complained in the Guardian that Britain had been negotiating over Falklands sovereignty for 16 years before the war. Now, 40 years on, both countries were behaving “as if the conflict took place yesterday”. Could Britain not get over the hostility? Could the two countries, both now democracies, not get back at least to the Falklands communication agreements of the 1970s? The way London raises the issue of self-determination is something of a red herring. The islanders are not autonomous, for they depend on Britain’s goodwill for their security. Britain effectively disposed of Aden, Diego Garcia and Hong Kong when it suited the national interest. The islanders were persuaded by Scott and Rowlands of the need for compromise. This was almost achieved. Britain won the war, but now finds itself having to sustain a military base in the South Atlantic, while all Argentina has to do is smirk. The solution of leaseback sought by Rowlands, Ridley and others honours geography, history, diplomacy and economics. It is common sense. More than £60m a year on military defence for the islands is not. If London’s politicians lack the guts to seek a deal with Buenos Aires, perhaps the islanders should face the future and seek one for themselves.

4/8/2022,"Radio transmissions in which Russian soldiers appear to talk among themselves about carrying out premeditated civilian killings in Ukraine have been intercepted by Germany’s foreign intelligence service, a source close to the findings has said. The evidence was presented by officials from the foreign intelligence service, the BND, to parliamentarians on Wednesday. Reports of the radio communications were first published in the German news magazine Spiegel, which said the communications related to atrocities carried out in Bucha, north of Kyiv. Several of them can be directly matched to locations and objects shown in photos that document the aftermath of the killings, the magazine reported. A mass grave was discovered in Bucha at the weekend along with dozens of corpses of civilians lying on the ground, after the withdrawal of the Russian military. The hands of some of the dead were tied, while other corpses showed signs of torture. Numerous women and children are believed to have been among the victims. The Russian government has vehemently denied the claims that its soldiers carried out the killings, which world leaders including Joe Biden and Germany’s Olaf Scholz have described as war crimes. Russia has repeatedly claimed the killings have been staged. Still, increasing numbers of witness accounts have added to the veracity of the reports. In the communications, Russian soldiers were claimed to have discussed how they had questioned Ukrainian soldiers as well as civilians before shooting them. According to Spiegel, which indirectly referenced people who had been present at the meeting at which the BND officers delivered the fresh evidence to a select group of MPs, the recordings “entirely invalidate Russia’s denials”. In one of the radio conversations, a Russian voice is heard telling someone how he and another soldier shot a person who had been on a bicycle. One of the many pictures of the atrocities to have gone around the world in recent days was of the corpse of a person next to a bicycle. In another communication, a man was heard saying: “Firstly you question the soldier, then you shoot them.” The impression given was that the soldiers were talking matter-of-factly about the killings as if they were discussing everyday activities, the MPs were told, according to Spiegel. The intelligence material is also said to give credence to reports that the Russian mercenary Wagner Group was central participants in the killings. The group was previously active in the war in Syria where the vicious nature of its activities was notorious. Speaking on Thursday, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said the number of bodies found in the city was increasing every day, with 320 civilians identified so far. Specialist crime scene officers had retrieved corpses from private estates, parks and squares, he said, as well as from temporary graves. “Almost 90% were killed by bullets, not shrapnel,” he added. The BND’s recordings have intensified suspicions that these killings were neither random nor carried out by soldiers who might have been acting autonomously as has previously been suggested. Other radio recordings are being analysed, according to Spiegel. However, the precise localisation of them appears to be more difficult. They reportedly point to similar activities in other parts of Ukraine, in and around the port city of Mariupol which has been largely destroyed by Russian bombardment. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the expertise of forensic specialists in Europe was being sought as a matter of urgency, with independent experts needing to be ready to gather as much evidence as quickly as possible as soon as suspected atrocities came to light, of which the source said it was expected there would be many more. A massacre in Mali last week in which 300 people died and in which Russian fighters are alleged to have been involved had “all the hallmarks of the modus operandi of the Russian army”, the source said, adding it was similar to attacks the army had been involved in in Syria. This had raised the expectation that expert capacities to gather forensic evidence would increasingly be needed, the source added. In Ukraine on Thursday, as humanitarian relief teams and volunteers ventured further into territory around Kyiv retaken from Russian troops, evidence of more atrocities committed against Ukrainian civilians by the occupying force continued to emerge. As roads were cleared of mines and the wreckage of burned tanks and civilian cars, residents returned home to find their homes looted or destroyed, neighbours missing, bodies decomposing in basements, and hastily dug graves in gardens. The violence and death in towns and villages surrounding Kyiv stands out even by the abysmal standards of other conflict zones. Also on Thursday, Amnesty International published a report detailing apparent war crimes in the Kyiv region, based on interviews with 20 people who witnessed or had direct knowledge of horrifying violence. A woman in a village east of the capital told Amnesty’s investigators that on 9 March two Russian soldiers entered her house, killed her husband and repeatedly raped her at gunpoint while her young son hid nearby. She later managed to escape to Ukrainian-controlled territory. In the village of Vorzel, Nataliya and Valeryi Tkachova left their basement on 3 March to check whether Russian tanks were coming, telling their 18-year-old daughter Kateryna to stay hidden. After hearing gunshots, Kateryna left the cellar to find her parents lying dead in the street, her father shot six times in the back, and her mother once in the chest. She was assisted in leaving Vorzel on 10 March. “Testimonies show that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality,” Agnès Callamard, Amnesty’s secretary general, said in a statement. “The intentional killing of civilians is a human rights violation and a war crime. These deaths must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible must be prosecuted, including up the chain of command.”",News/World news,Russian soldiers ‘discussed killing civilians’ in Ukraine in radio intercepts,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/russian-soldiers-discussed-killing-civilians-in-radio-intercepts
4/8/2022,"Being bystanders to this week’s Big Cup, Euro Vase and even the Tin Pot Brendan’s brave Leicester boys are trying to win, these are dark days for Manchester United. The Ole dream died last winter and Ralf Rangick is a lame-duck caretaker manager/consultant/assistant to the regional manager.

The word among proper journalists is that Erik ten Hag is to be crowned the new boss of Big Red, a manager fitting the club’s preferred profile of being a young, progressive type with much to prove, nothing like the yesterday’s man appointments of José and Louis van Gaal. Ten Hag, the Ajax manager, is just 52 years old, and by the time he takes control in July, will be a whole 13 months younger than José when he took the job in 2016. For his first managerial appointment as chief suit since succeeding Ed Woodward, Richard Arnold, a man who once set his sights on the club being as popular on social media disgraces as Vin Diesel, has taken on the advice of back office-bound Ralfie, chief football suit John Murtough and chief tracksuit Darren Fletcher with co-owner Joel Glazer having the final say as, frankly, he and his kin have on everything happening in M16. That’s the Glazer family who, when fans cut up rough last year about the Super League and the general absolute state of things, promised fans could buy shares in the club to have more of a say. According to Big Website, such a venture may not actually happen, since votes for share-owning fans aren’t worth the ballot paper they are written on. Ten Hag has reportedly been selected ahead of World Cup-headed Luis Enrique, Sevilla head honacho Julen Lopetegui, and Mauricio Pochettino, the last of whom is now destined to be the United manager who never was.

4/8/2022,"The Co-op Group has warned of continuing problems with food supplies and inflation after revealing that profits more than halved last year amid supply chain disruption and higher staff wages. The mutual said underlying profit for 2021, stripping out a one-off £99m gain relating to the sale of the Co-operative Bank in 2017, was down 57% to £100m, compared with the year before, and that sales slipped to £11.2bn, from £11.5bn. Sales at the group’s food business fell by 2% to £9.1bn despite investing £140m in opening 50 new stores and refitting 87 more, and spending £18m on cutting prices. While in-store sales declined, online sales soared from £70m the year before to £200m thanks in part to tie-ups with Deliveroo and Amazon. Sales also slipped at the Co-op’s funerals business, declining by £8m to £264m. Shirine Khoury-Haq, the incoming interim chief executive of the Co-op, said: “The last year has seen us facing some significant challenges, including significant supply chain issues in the second half coming at the same time as our food business transformation and increasing inflationary pressures. “The difficult operating environment disproportionately impacted our food business, given its focus on the community convenience market, with an operating model that is more reliant on flexibility in the supply chain.” She said the Co-op would be reexamining its current strategy of opening 50 to 100 stores a year as she suspected change would be required given the shift to online shopping and cost challenges. Khoury-Haq said inflation and supply chain problems were not just being prompted by the war in Ukraine, which has driven up the price of energy and affected supplies of wheat and edible oils. Even the price of coffins in the group’s funeral business have increased because of global shortages of wood and other resources partly as a result of the pandemic. Problems with heavy rainfall and flooding in Spain, which supplies large amounts of fresh vegetables to the UK at this time of the year, have also hit supplies of broccoli, courgettes and other vegetables. Khoury-Haq, who replaces Steve Murrells in May, said the Co-op had been forced to source elsewhere or offer alternatives because of shortages. She said some food price increases were “inevitable” this year, but the Co-op was trying to mitigate the problems for customers by not raising the price on 1,000 key items and adding 100 extra products to its budget range. The Co-op said it was outperforming the grocery market. However, it expected its food business to “face continued challenges during the year” amid “inflationary pressures and the economic uncertainty facing customers”. Allan Leighton, the chair of the Co-op, said: “The economic headwinds look stark and will be tricky to navigate but through our continued planned strategic investments our Co-op is well placed to ride out the storm and prosper beyond.”",News/Business,Co-op warns over food supplies and inflation at it reveals 57% profit fall,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/07/co-op-warns-food-supplies-inflation-profits-fall-57-per-cent-2021
