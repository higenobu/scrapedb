2/20/2022,"A first-past-the-post voting system is a phenomenally crude and democratically weak way of electing MPs. All the prizes go to the party that wins a minority of the votes, with other parties excluded – a route to unchecked, unbalanced, even corrupt, government. Elsewhere in Europe, only Belarus adopts it, backed by Vladimir Putin, as a way of ensuring that Russia’s puppet president, Alexander Lukashenko, has remained in power since 1994 to ensure Belarus’s fealty.  The Conservative party’s dominance – it has been in power twice as often as Labour since 1918, notwithstanding it never winning a majority of votes – is because the opposition parties fight each other and divide their vote. The only rational response, if not an electoral pact to allow only one candidate against the Tories in each constituency, is some form of informal non-aggression pact. At the very least, Liberal Democrats and Labour should not campaign actively in those seats where neither has a chance of winning and give the other as free a run as possible. It was thus very welcome news last week that the two parties are discussing precisely that. Labour will not campaign actively in the Lib Dems’ top 30 target seats where they lie a good second, nor will the Lib Dems campaign actively in Labour’s top target seats. Only in Sheffield Hallam and Cambridge is the arrangement threatened, but not enough to imperil the wider enterprise. Given Labour’s challenge – it needs to win 128 seats to form a government – if the Lib Dems can win 15 seats in the Tories’ blue wall it makes a non-Tory government more likely. This is no more than scaling up what was done in the Batley and Spen byelection last summer, where the Lib Dems fought a limited campaign, so allowing Labour to hold a tough seat, and Chesham and Amersham and North Shropshire, where only the Lib Dems had the prospect of winning the seats. They duly won. Most party activists understand and support the argument, although for Labour the memory of Nick Clegg supporting austerity remains a blot on the Lib Dem record, while Lib Dems cannot easily forget or forgive Jeremy Corbyn. Both should relax. Most Lib Dem and Labour members share the same views of both. In the Lib Dems’ case, the prospect of another coalition is toxic: any arrangement will be confined to agreeing to support a minority Labour government on a “supply and motion” basis – voting through the budget and treating each legislative motion on its merits. Purists will say voters require a choice, that parties should not take their preferences for granted and that the policies are distinct. Wrong. Most voters understand the shortcomings of first past the-post and want to vote wisely, hence the recent byelection results and the growth of tactical voting websites. As for policy, the priorities are shared: clean up politics, repair our broken relationship with the EU, mobilise levelling up, bind our fractured society and reset capitalism. There will even be agreement on reforming the voting system, now trade union opposition that blocked it at Labour’s 2021 party conference has been dropped. But the parties cannot be too quiet in their non-aggression pact. Voters – and newspapers such as the Observer that have long championed tactical voting – need to know what the parties expect in different seats. The sample sizes to get accurate opinion poll predictions in hundreds of constituencies are too large and expensive and it is easy to make mistakes. Both parties urge open and transparent government. They are right. They should start with open and transparent communication with the electorate about which seats they intend fiercely to contest and those they don’t. Let’s do it properly this time.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on the non-aggression pact between Labour and the Lib Dems | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/20/the-observer-view-on-the-labour-and-lib-dem-non-aggession-pact
2/20/2022,"Historic England is launching a scheme to find overlooked, ordinary places that celebrate England’s working-class heritage. The public body, which manages the official register of historic listed buildings and nationally protected sites in England, is looking for council estates, factories, mines and other “overlooked historic places” that tell an important story about England’s past.  On Wednesday, it will invite community and heritage organisations to apply for a new Everyday Heritage Grant scheme. Grants of up to £25,000 will be awarded to projects that highlight the hidden histories of local places and buildings, with a particular emphasis on those where “ordinary people” have worked, lived or socialised, such as terraced houses, pubs, clubs, farms, shipyards and railways. “This is about recognising places that mean a lot to people whose stories aren’t necessarily often celebrated,” said spokesperson Sean Curran, adding that rich and historic sites are all around us. “You don’t have to go and visit a castle to engage with heritage – you’re probably doing it everyday by visiting your local high street, going to the shop around the corner or the train station to get to work. These are places with really rich important heritage and social history. And sometimes we forget about them.” As far back as 2011, a survey carried out by Historic England found that 85% of respondents thought that England’s industrial heritage should be valued and appreciated, and four out of five (80%) believed that such heritage was as important to preserve as were castles and country houses. A 2017 survey had similar findings. “There’s definitely an appetite for celebrating working-class heritage,” said Curran. Previous buildings that Historic England has recognised through listing, or saved through grants, include the Salford Lads Club, a Grade II-listed leisure club for young men, and the Byker estate, where the BBC TV show Byker Grove, which launched the careers of Ant and Dec, was based. Curran said that the new grants scheme would enable Historic England to see how communities told their own stories. “I’m from a mining family in Sunderland, and I can imagine an interview project with people who remember their parents working in the mines,” they said. Grants are likely to be awarded for oral history projects of this kind and also proposals such as self-guided walking tours, artist collaborations and the creation of digital resources. The aim is to find ordinary everyday places, and then to find out what’s extraordinary about them, Curran said. “Hopefully, we will find out stories that we didn’t know about.” Historic England is also hoping to fund projects that provide innovative volunteering opportunities for young people, or for people facing loneliness and isolation, as well as to contribute positively to participants’ wellbeing. Only £300,000 of grant money is available in total, and the organisation is therefore keen to stress that it is particularly interested in funding smaller grassroots projects that need £10,000 or less. Nigel Huddleston, heritage minister, said: “Our heritage belongs to us all and should be accessible to everyone. I welcome plans for new community-led projects to tell the story of working people across the country, bringing our collective and shared history back to life.” The deadline for applications is 23 May. “We’re really looking forward to seeing the creative ways of recognising heritage that people come up with,” said Curran.",Arts/Culture,Not just castles: Historic England offers grants to ‘ordinary’ places like pubs and terraced houses,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/20/not-just-castles-historic-england-offers-grants-to-ordinary-places-like-pubs-and-terraced-houses
2/20/2022,"A flotilla of British-built heat-sensing satellites is to be launched into Earth orbit to pinpoint badly insulated buildings across the planet. Seven thermal-imaging probes are being constructed in Guildford, and these are intended to play a key role in the battle against global heating by showing how homes, offices and cities can be made more energy efficient. This week, the British space company Satellite Vu will announce that the first of its heat-sensing satellites is to be carried aloft early next year on a Falcon 9 rocket, the launcher operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company.  A further six probes will be put into orbit over the next two or three years – and some may be launched from spaceports now under construction in Cornwall, Shetland, north Scotland and other parts of the UK. The aim of Satellite Vu’s programme is to create a fleet of probes that will be able to carry out a constant, worldwide survey measuring heat emanating from buildings. This will be achieved using high-definition infrared radiation detectors that will show where buildings are leaking significant levels of energy, and which are wasting power. “Our satellites are going to be fitted with unique infrared cameras that can measure heat emissions from any building on the planet,” said Anthony Baker, Satellite Vu’s chief executive. “At present, it is only possible to make broad surveys of heat being emitted in a neighbourhood. Our satellites will be fitted with super-high-resolution detectors, which will allow them to study individual buildings and show how much heat is escaping from them.” He added: “The crucial point is that a lot of people want to get to the stage where we can achieve net zero emissions of greenhouse gases. However, they face a lot of problems not just in generating power cleanly but in preventing heat being wasted from badly insulated offices, homes and factories. “We will provide the data that will show companies, governments and local authorities across the world where they need to act and how they can cut their energy bills.” Satellite Vu has raised £20m in venture capital to fund its programme and has received grants from the UK Space Agency and the European Space Agency. The company expects to make money by selling its data to organisations and companies that are looking for ways to cut power bills as the pressure increases on nations to cut their carbon emissions. The spacecraft that will carry out this monitoring are being constructed by Surrey Satellite Technology Limited, which is based in Guildford. Each one will be able to operate night and day while measuring heat output on the ground with an accuracy of 2C (3.6F). This data should have a wide range of applications, said Baker. It should help alleviate the effect of heat islands in cities, which can heat up far more severely than surrounding rural areas because of the prevalence of dense materials such as concrete and metal. The data should also help monitor river pollution from factories, cut heating bills by ensuring buildings are energy efficient, assess the activity status of solar panels and monitor wildfire outbreaks in open land. However, the company has not yet decided on a name for its satellite programme. “A lot of companies and authorities want to make improvements in the way we use energy and generate heat,” said Baker. “But they need to know exactly where to direct their efforts. By giving them precise data about where heat is being allowed to spill out of buildings into the open, we believe we can help them make a real difference and save energy.”",News/Environment,Draughty window or door?

2/20/2022,"When Volodymyr Zelenskiy sought to become Ukraine’s president he stood on a platform of peace. Zelenskiy promised to sit down with Vladimir Putin and to reach a deal with Russia. He would end the unpopular war in the east and concentrate on important domestic reforms. These included ridding the country of corruption and oligarchs.  The plan didn’t work out. Nearly three years after winning a landslide victory, Zelenskiy is a president on the brink of war. About 190,000 Russian troops are poised on Ukraine’s borders. The US president, Joe Biden, has warned of an attack on Kyiv. A Kremlin military offensive – whether full-scale or more limited in scope – seems likely, possibly within hours or days. This existential crisis for Ukraine has brought Zelenskiy global attention. Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz are among European leaders who have visited Kyiv and expressed support for its pro-western government. On Saturday Zelenskiy met the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, and Johnson at the Munich security conference, where Ukraine’s fate was discussed, and from which Russia was glaringly absent. But critics fear that by refusing to make concessions to Moscow, Zelenskiy is steering his country towards disaster. They argue he needs to find a pragmatic solution to the dangerous standoff with Putin – ruling out Nato membership for Ukraine, at least for now – a key Russian demand. The US and its allies would go along with such a declaration, privately breathing a sigh of relief, they argue. “The Russians will keep on until Zelenskiy gets the message,” Vasyl Filipchuk, a former senior Ukrainian diplomat and foreign affairs spokesperson said. “They want him to stop what they see as anti-Russian rhetoric. A statement on Nato would calm the situation down. Moscow and Nato would be happy. A few in Ukraine’s establishment would be displeased.” Filipchuk said he was increasingly concerned about the likelihood of a Russian attack, having discounted the threat up until last week. Since Thursday there has been intense artillery bombardment from separatist positions. Several allegedly false-flag events – a car bomb in Donetsk, a shell landing on Russian territory – have fuelled fears that a Russian offensive is inevitable. “The risks of direct military fire are there. It’s thinkable. I put the chances of a fully fledged war in the Donbas at 30%,” Filipchuk said. “Zelenskiy has had a very bad crisis. He doesn’t understand the depth of the problem. He’s badly advised. And he’s afraid.” The president’s refusal to compromise over Nato is based on his fear of unpopularity, observers suggest. They believe he is terrified of a backlash from supporters of Petro Poroshenko – Zelenskiy’s ambitious, hawkish predecessor – and rightwing nationalists. In recent months, Zelenskiy’s once high ratings have fallen, while his Servant of the People party has found itself mired in scandal. “Winston Churchill promised nothing but blood, sweat and tears. I’m afraid Mr Zelenskiy is not capable of that,” Evgeniy Kiselyov, a leading journalist and talkshow host, said. “A real politician is one who can speak at a moment of national emergency.” The president “lagged behind events” and was “too much” shaped by his previous career as a celebrity actor, Kiselyov suggested. In public, western governments have expressed solidarity with Zelenskiy. The US, UK and Lithuanians have sent anti-tank weapons and defensive arms. Washington and London have cast Ukraine’s struggle with Russia as a civilisational fight between democracy and authoritarianism. At stake is a sovereign country’s right to make its own security choices and alliances, versus an outdated imperial model of spheres of influence, they recognise. But behind the scenes, there has been exasperation with Zelenskiy too. He has irked his allies, especially the Americans, by dismissing predictions of Russian invasion as panic-mongering and media hysteria. These scenarios have damaged Ukraine’s economy, devalued its currency and undermined business confidence, he has publicly complained in recent weeks. Zelenskiy has also faulted the US for closing down its embassy in Kyiv and relocating diplomatic personnel, including CIA officers, to the western city of Lviv. “We do not have a titanic situation here,” he told the Guardian earlier this month. He pointed out that Ukraine has already been at war for eight years, ever since Putin annexed Crimea and organised a pro-Russian uprising in the Donbas region. “I don’t think it is a good strategy. You don’t bite the hand that feeds you,” Kiselyov said, of Zelenskiy’s US critique. “Some key members of his team are so much afraid of Putin and unprepared psychologically. They don’t know what to do if he strikes.” Would Putin invade? “Difficult to say. I think he is a madman. I don’t think he lives in the real world,” Kiselyov replied. Kisleyov said Zelenskiy might have been shrewder in his dealings with the White House, grumbling only in private rather than airing his grievances. “He could have said: ‘I will support you. But give me something in return such as a couple of bucks to help the economy.’ Instead, Zelenskiy is seen whining,” he said. Zelenskiy’s party colleagues, however, say the president is doing a good job in difficult circumstances. They point out he remains Ukraine’s most popular politician, according to polls. He has a good chance of winning reelection in 2024 – assuming, that is, Moscow does not remove him by force. His party, Servant of the People, is faring less well. It looks certain next year to lose its Duma majority. “The president stays strong and calm,” Nikita Poturaev, a deputy in Zelensiky’s party and political consultant, said, speaking from his parliamentary office in Kyiv, across the road from Zelenskiy’s palace residence. Zelenskiy enjoyed meeting world leaders and was quick to build relationships with them, Poturaev added. He said Zelenskiy was not personally corrupt, unlike previous holders of the job. They include Viktor Yanukovich, Ukraine’s pro-Russian leader, who looted the state budget before fleeing to Moscow in 2014, after his security forces opened fire on unarmed protesters, killing 100 of them. Perhaps the greatest criticism of Zelenskiy is that he has failed to prepare his citizens for a bloody war. Ukraine’s army is in better shape than in 2014, when it suffered a series of humiliating defeats. Thus far, Zelenskiy has declined to hand out weapons to civilians, possibly fearing that they might be used to overthrow his administration. Instead, volunteers have organised training and national defence. Serhiy Leshchenko, a former MP and prominent journalist, said Zelenskiy had withstood pressure from Moscow to implement the “toxic” Minsk accords, signed in 2015 at a moment of Ukrainian military weakness. Under the deal, Kyiv would grant autonomy to the separatist regions – in effect handing Moscow a veto over foreign policy – in return for demilitarisation. “Zelenskiy didn’t betray Ukraine or give Putin what he wants,” Leshchenko said. “It’s just possible if he survives this crisis he can regain his political credibility.” “I think the threat is great. I’m more with our allies than the Zelenskiy side,” Olexiy Haran, a professor of comparative politics at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, said. He cited a recent poll by the Kyiv international institute for sociology which indicated half of Ukrainians thought Zelenskiy should have done more to get ready for a conflict with Russia. Haran added: “The rhetoric coming from Moscow is very dangerous. Putin has increased stress so high. It is difficult to see how he can back down now.”",News/World news,"Ukraine’s leader stood on platform of peace, but finds himself on brink of war",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/20/ukraines-leader-stood-on-platform-of-peace-but-finds-himself-on-brink-war
2/20/2022,"The Biden White House has decided to stop tying inflation to corporate power. That’s a big mistake. I’ll get to the reason for the shift in a moment. First, I want to be clear about the relationship between inflation and corporate power.  While most of the price increases now affecting the US and global economies have been the result of global supply chain problems, this doesn’t explain why big and hugely profitable corporations are passing these cost increases on to their customers in the form of higher prices. They don’t need to do so. With corporate profits at near record levels, they could easily absorb the cost increases. They’re raising prices because they can – and they can because they don’t face meaningful competition. As the White House National Economic Council put it in a December report: “Businesses that face meaningful competition can’t do that, because they would lose business to a competitor that did not hike its margins.” Starbucks is raising its prices to consumers, blaming the rising costs of supplies. But Starbucks is so profitable it could easily absorb these costs – it just reported a 31% increase in yearly profits. Why didn’t it just swallow the cost increases? Ditto for McDonald’s and Chipotle, whose revenues have soared but who are nonetheless raising prices. And for Procter & Gamble, which continues to rake in record profits but is raising prices. Also for Amazon, Kroger, Costco and Target. All are able to pass cost increases on to consumers in the form of higher prices because they face so little competition. As Chipotle’s chief financial officer said, “Our ultimate goal … is to fully protect our margins.” Worse yet, inflation has given some big corporations cover to increase their prices well above their rising costs. In a recent survey, almost 60% of large retailers say inflation has given them the ability to raise prices beyond what’s required to offset higher costs. Meat prices are soaring because the four giant meat processing corporations that dominate the industry are “using their market power to extract bigger and bigger profit margins for themselves”, according to a recent report from the White House National Economic Council (emphasis added). Not incidentally, that report was dated 10 December. Now, the White House is pulling its punches. Why has the White House stopped explaining this to the public? The Washington Post reports that when the prepared congressional testimony of a senior administration official (Janet Yellen?) was recently circulated inside the White House, it included a passage tying inflation to corporate consolidation and monopoly power. But that language was deleted from the remarks before they were delivered. Apparently, members of the White House Council of Economic Advisers raised objections. I don’t know what their objections were, but some economists argue that since corporations with market power wouldn’t need to wait until the current inflation to raise prices, corporate power can’t be contributing to inflation. This argument ignores the ease by which powerful corporations can pass on their own cost increases to customers in higher prices or use inflation to disguise even higher price increases. It seems likely that the Council of Economic Advisers is being influenced by two Democratic economists from a previous administration. According to the Post, the former Democratic treasury secretary Larry Summers and Jason Furman, a top economist in the Obama administration, have been critical of attempts to link corporate market power to inflation. “Business-bashing is terrible economics and not very good politics in my view,” Summers said in an interview. Wrong. Showing the connections between corporate power and inflation is not “business-bashing”. It’s holding powerful corporations accountable. Whether through antitrust enforcement (or the threat of it), a windfall profits tax or price controls, or all three, it’s important for the administration and Congress to do what they can to prevent hugely profitable monopolistic corporations from raising their prices. Otherwise, responsibility for controlling inflation falls entirely to the Federal Reserve, which has only one weapon at its disposal – higher interest rates. Higher interest rates will slow the economy and likely cause millions of lower-wage workers to lose their jobs and forfeit long-overdue wage increases.

2/20/2022,"The question I am 32-year-old man with a successful career and a loving girlfriend. I’ve suffered my fair share of trauma in my childhood and adult life and have some health issues. The problem I have right now is that my anxiety levels are so high that every morning I am frozen in fear. I struggle to get washed and dressed and have no motivation to get up and go. But it isn’t really just that. I feel physically sick at the thought of leaving the safe confines of my bedroom. I tend to watch the same TV shows for escapism over and over again. The only time I truly feel safe is at night when everyone is asleep and I’m alone – the world is quiet and it’s just me. I fear disaster and fear people expecting things of me. I am scared I will be trapped in their expectations and I won’t be able to meet them. I’m so demotivated at work and struggle to actually perform as I should. I have a high-pressure job and feel deeply insecure all the time. What can I do? Philippa’s answer Telling me about this might not have been easy. I admire you for taking that step. Here is another: I want you to notice your breathing. Stop reading this for 10 seconds or so and notice how you breathe. OK, take 20 seconds now, and it doesn’t matter if it’s longer or shorter than that – I really want you to notice the in-breath and then your out-breath. This is you having contact with yourself in the present. When you notice how you are breathing, do you slow your breathing down? Before you get up in the morning, lie in bed being aware of your breath for a minute or two. Your attention will wander; bring it back to your breath. I don’t know about you, but I did this exercise as I typed and I felt the tiniest bit calmer – each bit of calming helps.  You’ve discovered you need alone time to regain equilibrium, and this is OK. If you have a fear of the unknown, then replaying a TV programme where you know what is going to happen means you have control of the future: you can predict with accuracy the outcome. It’s understandable that you find this soothing as you’ve had trauma in your life. Trauma often means having shocks. When you can’t be alone in your room with the TV, it sounds as if you keep your body in a constant state of readiness. Your tense muscles are eager to prepare you so that you won’t be shocked next time “it” happens – whatever “it” is. This way of organising your body has also served you well, because you have a successful career and a lovely girlfriend, so there might almost be a subconscious superstition that you must always arrange yourself on this sort of precipice for good fortune to continue. We can get attached to worry in this way and it isn’t as helpful as we unconsciously assume. But it’s OK now to turn that high alert state down a few notches. When you are feeling anxious I want you to scan your body to notice which of your muscles are tight, which are loose. Then I’d like you to experiment tightening where you are already tight and collapsing where you are loose, one notch at a time, and notice how you feel as you do this. It’s easier to tense up more than it is to just relax, and when we become more aware of how we make ourselves tense, we can begin to learn how to disorganise that system. This exercise will also help you get out of your mind and into your senses. If you go to your doctor you can get medication for anxiety to tide you over while you do the work you need to get more control over your tension and it will be easier to do this if you work with a therapist. I would recommend a psychotherapist who works with the body as well as the mind for your issues. It is in our bodies that we hold anxiety and the traumas that gave it to us. There is more you can do. To stop anxiety whirling around in your head, get your fears down on paper in a numbered list. Make it as specific as you can. Then change all the what-ifs into so-whats and notice how altering your language like this makes you feel. Develop your observer part. Keep a journal of moods, sensations and observations. This part is not part of your gratitude, or your anxiety, or your love or your fear, it just observes the different emotions and sensations you have. Speak from this part. This means instead of saying, “I’m anxious” you’ll say, “I notice I am feeling anxious.” The former is a whole-body definition and the latter is you noticing that a part of you is anxious. You can even separate further from your anxiety by giving it a persona, calling it “Mr Anxiety” or whatever seems right. It’s a small tweak but you will find that it makes a difference. You have a successful career and a good relationship, which is great. This means that you have other sides to you that function well. You can learn to use these parts so that anxiety doesn’t keep the upper hand. Recommended reading: Bessel van der Kolk’s The Body Keeps The Score.

2/20/2022,"Puiattino Pinot Grigio, Friuli, Itay 2020 (£10, Tesco) Much as I like to think of myself as a fair and objective critic of all things vinous, I have to admit to a few stubborn prejudices. I’m instinctively suspicious, for example, of any wine poured from a bottle with a bright animal cartoon on the label; of any wine selling for much more than £30 in its very first vintage; and of anything with the words oak, barrels, coffee or chocolate too prominent in the name or back-label description. I’m not saying that the prejudices are insurmountable. But in each case the wine has to be really quite exceptional if it’s going to break down a resistance built on years of disappointments. All of which is true, too, for another of my most resilient unconscious biases: supermarket pinot grigio. So dull and interchangeable are most examples of the popular dry white, that when a wine as fluent, pear-juicy and subtly honeyed as Puiattino’s crops up among the also-rans in a Tesco lineup I think I can be forgiven for doing a double-take. Cavit Rulendis Pinot Grigio, Trentino Superiore, Italy 2019 (from £14.99, aitkenwines.com; kwoff.co.uk) I said “supermarket pinot grigio”, but you can find plenty of examples of the bland, watery, industrial version of the grape in pubs, restaurants and independent wine merchants, too. In many cases these aren’t bad wines exactly, just not something to capture the imagination or provoke a shiver of pleasure or misty-eyed reflection like the best wines do. That pinot grigio has this reputation must be infuriating for the producers who use it to make wines full of distinctive personality and style. You can find these producers dotted throughout pinot grigio’s northeastern Italian homeland. Most of them are of the small, family-run, artisanal variety, but one of the most attractive pinot grigios I’ve tried recently is from one of Italy’s larger producers: the 4,500-grower Trentino co-operative, Cavit. The key is in the vineyards: steeply sloping, south-facing, high-altitude spots in the foothills of the Brenta Dolomites, producing a wine as coolly energetic as a mountain stream, and as fragrant as a spring meadow.  Radikon Sivi Pinot Grigio, Italy 2019 (from £36, juicedwine; buonvino.co.uk) Many of the best pinot grigio producers ply their trade in the far northeastern Friuli-Venezia-Giulia region. In the west, I’d pick out the racy purity of Russolo Pinot Grigio Ronco Calaj 2020 (£14.01, shelvedwine.com). To the east, in Colli Orientali, you can find a combination of unforced depth of flavour with subtle spice, white flowers and that crucial driving freshness in a wine such as Livio Felluga Pinot Grigio 2020 (£27, petershamcellar.com). In Isonzo, in the southeast of the region, you can get a richer dose of mouthfilling spicy and exotic-fruited ripeness that is akin to the wines made from the same variety under its French alias, pinot gris, in Alsace in the shape of Lis Neris Gris Pinot Grigio 2018 (£35.90, hedonism.co.uk); and in Collio in the far east of Friuli, straddling the border of Slovenia, you get the intensely herby-nutty, tangy, subtly grippy swirl of Radikon’s Sivi orange wine, made with extended contact between the juice and pinot grigio’s pinkish-grey skins.

Snacks and small plates £3.75-£7, cheese and charcuterie sharing platters £13, desserts £3.50-£7.50, wines from £24 Anybody with a modicum of imagination dreams occasionally of another life. We find ourselves on a Greek island for a couple of weeks and quickly picture never leaving and becoming instead this sun-slapped, unshaven version of ourselves, forever squiffy on chilled glasses of something rough. Until we remember our addiction to flat whites, reliable broadband and that we actually like having our nose stuffed into the unwashed armpit of a stranger on the Northern Line during the morning commute. Or we wander the streets of Greenwich Village and decide that this is who we really are; that we should own a brownstone stoop and sit on it. If only it wasn’t for the health insurance thing, and the gun ownership thing.  Each time I go to Bath, I have similar fantasies of other versions of me. I can imagine myself living in one of those high-ceilinged Georgian townhouses: wingback leather armchair, a glass of Madeira and a mildly dodgy collection of Victorian erotica. In this version of my life, I would be a regular at the Beckford Bottle Shop on the sweet, honey-stoned passageway that is Saville Row. I would be found on too many evenings in a state of mild disarray, overfilling one of the red banquettes that edge the room out the back of the wine shop. I would have a glass of whatever charming albariño they recommended, and then another and a third, while insisting that four plates of their anchovies on toast constituted dinner. The Bottle Shop opened here in 2017 and is an offshoot of the Beckford Group, which owns four country pubs in Wiltshire and Somerset. It presents itself as a wine merchant, but with the added joy of various rooms upstairs and down, where you can drink your purchases for an added £15 corkage, rather than some garish multiple mark-up. Although they told me, candidly, that there’s an increasing number of ostentatiously spendy types in the city who must be serviced with fatly priced bottles, they are big in the £15 to £30 range. God, but it’s civilised. It’s somewhere that can quiet all the bad thoughts. It’s exactly the place you’d want to be if, say, the Russians were facing off militarily against the whole of the Western world, the Antarctic ice shelf was crumbling into the sea and our moral blancmange of a prime minister had proved himself to be the shameless, truth-twisting, mendacious, oozing huckster we all knew he was. Thank God that’s not where we are, eh? But if we were, it’s good to know the grindingly pretty Beckford Bottle Shop would be there to make it all go away, one well-chosen glass at a time. At one end of the building is what they call the bistro. In the sense that the light-filled space has tables, chairs, waiters and a menu, the word does the job. The choice of dishes? Not so much. That’s less a criticism, and more an acknowledgment that what’s on offer here is not big plates of comfort food, but something to go alongside the thrilling wine selection. Everything on the two-dozen-strong bistro list, for example, is offered by the glass and carafe as well as the bottle. It kicks off with a Chateau Oumsiyat from Lebanon, works its way through French, Portuguese and Italian winemakers I’ve never heard of, and ends up somewhere in Greece. Recently, a journalist asked for my sagely thoughts on the sort of small plates that accompany this list: where had they come from? Where were they going? The latter was easy to answer. They are going nowhere. I might feel a queasy weariness each time I have to type the words for fear of repetition. Doubtless, others roll their eyes at the proposition. Generally, however, it seems that many diners and chefs like the opportunity to be unshackled occasionally from the tyranny of big main courses built outwards from a chunk of star ingredient. As to where they came from, we long ago stopped referencing tapas, because it seems too bloody obvious. Still, the menu at the Beckford Bottle Shop is the closest I’ve come to tapas with an RP British accent. Everything costs about £6 or £7. Obviously, there are those thumping anchovies on warm toast with rings of onion. With a nice nod to locality, there are Bath chaps; not the whole cured, pressed and breaded pig’s cheek the title describes, but precise square croquettes, demanding to be treated as finger food. There is a soft Bramley apple purée to lubricate the process. There are smoky pieces of cured mackerel, with smudges of black garlic, served warm so the oils run. They melt away to nothing on the tongue and are very much mourned when they are gone. A lot of the menu pushes forward vegetables. We have courgette fritti, as fat as chip-shop chips with a pungent aioli, and sweet carrots, both orange and purple, dressed with a few seeds and chopped herbs. Using the word “tartare” to describe the chopped beetroot on a muffin with goat’s curd and hazelnut, is to kick the English language in the shins when no one is looking. To be a tartare it should be uncooked. I really would hope they boiled the beetroot first. More importantly it’s all too much muffin and not quite enough beetroot. Roasted cauliflower comes slapped about with a bacon jam, which is cheating but given my overheated relationship with bacon I’m not going to object. Non-meat eaters might feel differently. Finally, there’s a big dollop of good whipped cod’s roe dribbled with herb oil the colour of a well-watered summer lawn, and toast with which to scoop it away. All of this, alongside chocolate mousse, or a plate of rhubarb with milk ice-cream with a sweet biscuit crumb, makes for more than a few nibbles and a little less than the full lunch. But that’s fine because this is the Beckford Bottle Shop, not the Beckford Kitchen. The whole offering is clear from the start. After all, that menu starts with cheese or charcuterie selections. Indeed, given this is drinking food, they deserve extra points for having put so much thought into it. If I ever do decide to buy that townhouse and that wingback chair and that interesting library, I can guarantee to show it all some love. That’s never going to happen. I’m happy where I am. But it’s good to know that if the identity crisis ever hits, the Beckford Bottle Shop will be there waiting for me. The largest ever Greggs Café has just opened inside a branch of Primark in Birmingham. The 130-seater includes doughnut themed seating booths in shades of pink icing. At the same time the two companies have announced a collaboration on an 11-strong Greggs-branded clothing collection, including a hoodie with the legend ‘It’s a pastry thing’ along the sleeve, so you can literally wear your devotion to the steak slice (greggs.co.uk). Various bits of data on the impact of the pandemic on hospitality are emerging. A survey by analysts CGA and WiFi Solutions has found that Leeds currently has the healthiest sector of the UK’s most populous cities. In the four weeks to 15 January, it saw only a 0.2% drop in sales compared with the same period in 2019. In London it was a 19% drop. Meanwhile Pret a Manger has reported its City of London stores are trading at 78% of pre pandemic levels, while its suburban outlets are reporting sales a third higher than before March 2020. A new sushi restaurant in Leatherhead called Beluga has apologised profusely for a set of dress code terms and conditions which insisted women wore “sexy” outfits to gain admittance. It said “women can wear skinny jeans with sexy black ankle-strap heels and with a form fitting top”. The restaurant apologised via Instagram and said these rules had been added to the T&Cs “mistakenly”.

2/20/2022,"We arrive in Denmark to the mystery of molehills. An explosion of earth mounds picked out in the car headlights like a compound of pyramids. Henri is not happy. They are mobile, the moles, moving house from one corner of the meadow to another. An ancient Aztec city of soil. The nice neighbour is obsessed with them. He has an annual petanque tournament and is lined-lawn crazy. For him it is war. I don’t exactly welcome them, but figure they’re more resident than me.  Anyway, the soil they unearth is useful today for topping Ina’s winter window box. Most I transport to the old fire pit and a few other spots around the border. Last year, these were a happy home to snaking nasturtiums, calendula and rampant borage. I cook food for the feral cat, a raggedy long-haired ginger tom abandoned at a year old a decade ago when another neighbour moved. I put out bowls of Christmas goose fat and make him chicken giblet stew. I figure as long as I draw the line at buying tinned food it’s fine. We are not here often enough to be a reliable source. We have come to see Ina, but there’s winter pruning to do. The fruit bushes: redcurrants and blackcurrants, the latter for Henri’s favourite jam. The redcurrants we leave for passing picking and the birds. The biggest jobs are the roses: two old Danish climbing varieties and multiple crimson and white rugosa that also grows everywhere along the shore. The Danes have a love-hate relationship with these. There was dark talk of the rugosa not being Danish enough – plans for uprooting them from the beaches. This, though, has receded. We arm ourselves with thick jackets and gloves and sharp secateurs. Henri is more fierce at pruning than me, so I content myself with wheeling away her cuttings. The low winter sun shines. It is good garden work.

2/20/2022,"In the ideal world of Buckingham Palace public relations, the most prominent headline about the royal family last week might have been a hurrah for the shortlist of the Queen’s platinum jubilee pudding competition, organised by Fortnum & Mason and judged by Mary Berry. However, try as the Palace might to make this a celebratory summer of bunting and “God bless you ma’am”, the monarch’s offspring keep on trashing the party plans. No sooner, it seems, has a table been prepared for a royal tea than an inspector calls. It is said that the secret to great longevity is never to stop having novel experiences. Whatever the truth of that idea, one experience that the Queen might have preferred to avoid is the necessity, in her 95th year, of bailing out her 62-year-old child with reportedly up to £12m so that he could avoid appearing in an American court to defend himself against allegations of coerced sex with a trafficked 17-year-old. Andrew, of course, maintains his innocence and in settling the case with his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, accepts none of her accusations. We might have to wait for long distant episodes of The Crown properly to imagine how the conversations went that led to those funds being released, but it is to be hoped that the Queen’s second son did not offer his mother versions of his “incapable of sweating” and Pizza Express excuses. One result of those chats was that Andrew was stripped of his military titles. The city of York is now looking for ways to cut ties with its disgraced duke.  Following hard on that shameful legal episode came the revelation that the heir to the throne may be questioned by the Metropolitan police in connection with alleged criminal corruption at one of his charitable foundations. Pending the inquiry, there is no reason not to cleave to the outraged faith of Prince Charles’s biographer Jonathan Dimbleby that his friend had no knowledge of those dealings: “If there has been some scam, some breaking of the law, you honestly think that he would have been party to that? It beggars belief!” The police will concentrate on the letter from the prince’s close aide Michael Fawcett, which allegedly offered to help Saudi tycoon Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz upgrade his honorary CBE to a knighthood – and to support his application for British citizenship – in exchange for generous donations to Charles’s charitable efforts to restore £45m Dumfries House in Ayrshire. Fawcett has resigned and Clarence House repeated its statement that “the Prince of Wales had no knowledge of the alleged offer of honours or British citizenship on the basis of donation to his charities”. Still, as details have emerged of the visitors’ book of donors who lined up for candlelit dinners with the heir to the British throne in support of that project, one question is hard to avoid: what, you wonder, did Prince Charles imagine was in it for them? It’s only a surprise that the News of the World’s fake sheikh never discussed funding the panelling of a Georgian dining room or pored over plans for Knockroon, the “Scottish Poundbury”. In her long reign the Queen, aided by a tight grip on privy purse millions, has avoided even the most distant whiff of venality. She has made the wearing of a crown containing some of the world’s largest diamonds seem like a heavy cross she is prepared to bear. Though she and her late husband may have moved between gilded palaces, they convincingly did so with Thermos flasks and Tupperware. The idea that such a sense of rectitude can be reliably passed on between generations is, as Thomas Paine long ago observed, an idea “as absurd as an hereditary mathematician; as ridiculous as an hereditary poet laureate”. Whether, as might seem preferable but unlikely, the Queen decides that 70 years on the throne is long enough for anyone, and effects a smooth handover this summer, or whether she soldiers on towards her self-addressed centenary telegram, the events of last week are another reminder that it is not going to be an easy transition. When crises come, as crises surely will, Charles III will not be able to draw on the deep reserves of affection that the Queen has always enjoyed. Assuming the expected succession, the future king will inherit the problem of his brother, which may recede along with Andrew himself into the Palace shadows, and the problem of his younger son, which will not. The other snippet of news last week that can hardly have brought jubilee cheer to Clarence House was the announcement that Prince Harry’s “frank memoir” will be published before the end of the year. As his father will know, publishers don’t pay $15m for a book without some guarantee of explosive candour. For most of her reign, and certainly in the last 40 years, the steadfastness of the Queen has held together the rickety and anachronistic institution itself. Charles, for all his good intentions, shows negligible evidence of perhaps the most remarkable of his mother’s qualities, her apparent self-contained indifference to how she is viewed. Is there public appetite for an emotionally needy monarch? Time will tell. Most likely, the succession will demonstrate the abiding truth baked into the hereditary principle, just as surely Mary Berry’s currants are baked into her fruit cakes. The institution may have struck lucky in the integrity and grace of the three score and ten of the present incumbent’s reign. But luck is all it ever can be.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on the future of the British monarchy | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/20/the-observer-view-on-the-future-of-the-monarchy
2/20/2022,"The concept of a fragrance wardrobe, with a myriad of scents on rotation depending on mood, season, location and occasion, has always made sense to me. Some might call it greedy – I call it keeping my options open. That said, I’d be the first to admit that having a roster of fragrances on tap can be expensive – and confusing. So if you prefer scent monogamy, consider these. Violette FR’s oil perfume is predominantly vetiver, but lightened with ylang-ylang and bergamot. And it’s easy to cart around. Serge Lutens? Not so much, but the cult cedarwood and plum scent – which celebrates its 30th birthday this year, hence the special-edition bottle – is no less desirable. Rose lovers: Kilian’s offering is audacious; it includes bergamot and orange blossom as well as a dash of marshmallow. Tom Ford Rose de Russie is leather-infused and Loewe’s Templo de Debod adds coconut, oud and saffron for an unexpected twist. Prefer fruity but grown-up? Chanel No 1, Gabar’s Swim (blackcurrant meets mossy) and Hermès’ Rhubarb are exquisite options. Citrus scents have universal appeal: Jo Malone London’s Italian-inspired scent will have you booking a holiday.

2/20/2022," We said the New Zealand police played Barry Manilow songs to tackle protesters in Wellington. It was actually the parliament Speaker, Trevor Mallard, who took this action (Politics after the pandemic, 13 February, p37).  An article about David Hoffman’s new book, Whitechapel Markets 1972-1977, was illustrated with an image, supplied to us by the publishers, of Sclater Street Market, Shoreditch, London, said to be taken in 1977. In fact the scene was photographed in 1990 (The big picture, 13 February, the New Review, p2).   Owing to an error in information supplied by the Intergenerational Foundation, we said its researchers predict that a graduate earning £27,000 a year will see their “disposable” income drop by almost 30%. Disposable income is what remains after tax. In fact, the researchers were referring to that percentage drop in “discretionary” income, meaning the money an individual has left to spend or save after tax and essential spending (‘Tax by stealth’ will hit under-30s on low wages hardest, 13 February, p19). Other recently amended articles include: Lies come in all shapes and sizes. This government is familiar with them all  This article was amended on 13 February 2022.

NHS staffing levels are at crisis point, so why isn’t it allowed to plan for the future?

2/20/2022,"I found Nick Cohen’s opinions on the lack of honesty in this government both moving and profound (“Lies come in all shapes and sizes. This government is familiar with them all”, Comment). The most worrying part of this state of affairs is where is the public anger? What have we become, when, to many, a prime minister and his crew being economical with the truth are seen as just a joke? I fear for the future of our democracy, because the voting public tend to believe that all politicians are liars and in it for themselves; this government confirms their opinions, so they just shrug their shoulders and accept it.Mrs A SturtonOakley, Basingstoke, Hampshire  Nick Cohen’s article was an impressive free verse tour de force. I can’t be the only one reminded of Adrian Mitchell’s To Whom It May Concern (Tell Me Lies About Vietnam). It’s too much to expect Cohen to give a reading at the Albert Hall but it would be good to see it on an Observer wallchart, with a copy on the walls of every classroom, hospital, foodbank and GP waiting room in the country.Mike HineKingston upon Thames, London That parliamentary procedure forces the Speaker to dismiss Ian Blackford for correctly calling out the prime minister’s lies, while leaving him impotent to enforce either the truth or an apology from the PM, emphasises the anachronism and shamefully demeans the system.Jan MortimerLewes, East Sussex As a retired police officer with experience of recruiting, I agree with former chief officer Sue Fish’s analysis of the reform needed to outlaw bad behaviour in the Met and elsewhere (“Can the Met change?”, Focus). Structures that last and give best service use the best material available and continue to do so when properly maintained. She hits the nail on the head when she blames poor policing on the failure to identify decent, diligent and empathetic applicants and to continue monitoring performance using the same measures. If these qualities are being subsumed by the requirement for purely technical skills, then it’s about time some deeper thought was given to the personal qualities of those whose function is to deal fairly with the public.Tony BurnleyBrampton, Cambridgeshire Michael Crick misunderstands the question of who is a racist (“‘I don’t think Farage is a racist but he does pander to racists’”, the New Review). Racism is as racism does: a politician who mobilises racist sentiments to win support, as Crick’s book shows that Farage has made a career out of doing and as Boris Johnson has also done, is as much a racist as a person who thinks people of a different ethnicity are inferior – and a more dangerous one to boot.Martin ShawSeaton, Devon “The edge of war: what, exactly, does Putin want in Ukraine?” (News) hinted at the real cause of the artificial crisis in saying that Vladimir Putin regarded Ukraine “as an integral part of historical Russia”. Putin’s Russia has turned away from the Soviet recognition of a Ukrainian people and stagnated to a tsarist imperial definition of Ukraine (together with Russians and Belarusians) as one of the three branches of a pan-Russian nation. Russian media repeatedly deny the existence of Ukraine and Ukrainians. Why is the crisis artificial? Nato has never intended to offer Ukraine membership, the US never had plans to instal missiles and Ukraine’s military cooperation with Nato is three decades old. The root cause is Putin’s obsession with Ukraine as a “Russian land” and his megalomaniac view of himself as the “gatherer of Russian lands”. We should not forget that contemporary pan-Russianism is as dangerous as was pan-Germanism in the 1930s.Dr Taras KuzioLondon SW1 “What’s so terrible about neutrality for Ukraine?” asks Simon Tisdall (“Macron fights to halt slide to war”, World). The answer is because neutrality means nothing to the Russians. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania declared their neutrality. They were occupied by subterfuge and then annexed by the USSR in 1940. It took until 1990-91 for those countries to regain their independence. Knowing the nature of their eastern neighbour, they began negotiating for Nato and EU membership, finally achieved in 2004. The Ukrainians know the region’s history, unlike many western commentators. They know neutrality is not the answer.Aleksas VilcinskasLondon SW20 David Murray is right to suggest that the low estimation of politicians for the prison service “could be addressed by giving prisoners the vote, as most of the rest of western Europe does” (Letters). In fact, the European court of human rights has ruled that Britain’s blanket ban on votes for convicted inmates is a breach of their human rights. The response in 2013 of the then prime minister, David Cameron, was that prisoners “damn well shouldn’t” be given the right to vote. His short-sighted refusal to implement the ruling has remained without consequence for the UK. So much, then, for the so-called threat of the ECHR to parliamentary sovereignty.Professor Gwyneth BoswellNorwich Johan Lundgren, easyJet CEO, says it’s “intellectually lazy” to argue that not flying is the best way to cut aviation emissions (Business profile). I wonder if he has seen the academic analysis from UK Fires on this issue. It’s not light reading. Having reviewed all low-carbon options for aviation between now and the 2050 net zero deadline, it concludes that Lundgren’s industry has left it too late to develop enough new aircraft, renewable energy, carbon capture and carbon capture storage facilities to balance the carbon books in time. What is “intellectually lazy”, I’d argue, is to go straight from observing that aviation brings people benefits (of course it does) to concluding that we must, despite the climate emergency, carry on flying to get these benefits rather than, say, using video conferencing and taking domestic holidays to cut emissions from business travel and tourism. Lundgren says “we’ve done our job at easyJet on this whole thing”. But there is not a single commercial aircraft in operation that doesn’t emit CO2, and no scalable zero-carbon technology is on the horizon. It’s hard to say whether this is because of laziness, complacency, lack of regulation, or simply the barriers of physics. But if we want to find solutions, we need to face the facts.Cait HewittLondon, SE1 Can I advise Will Hutton that his imaginary country, supervised by a government that is gradually pulling its citizens together to create a new normal, actually exists and is not far away (“I relish life opening up. But this libertarian dash for the Covid exit is reckless”, Comment). It is Scotland, where, despite propaganda to the contrary, a largely contented population has been helped through this pandemic by a government that has acted on the whole in a careful and thoughtful way. Mistakes have been made, but generally admitted to, and it seems that the careful approach has been both popular and accepted.Brian Bannatyne-ScottEdinburgh",News/From the Observer,Where is the anger over Boris Johnson’s lies? | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/feb/20/letters-where-is-the-anger-over-boris-johnson-lies

But as the addictive thriller has charged on, we’ve come to champion Sasha, the alter ego she has adopted to infiltrate a new world and find out what really happened to Chloe, the object of her social media obsession (and estranged best friend from school). This tense rollercoaster ride is mostly thanks to Doherty’s terrific performance as such a complicated woman.
