5/8/2022,"The most expensive property on the Monopoly board is Mayfair, which also happens to be the most exclusive expanse of real estate in real-life London. Flush with private equity firms, eye-wateringly expensive restaurants and luxury car showrooms, it voted Labour in last week’s local elections and helped swing Westminster council away from the Tories for the first time since the Beatles were in the charts with Can’t Buy Me Love. Recent years have seen working-class strongholds in the north of England turning Tory, and now you have the even odder spectacle of the super-rich in London voting Labour. That says something about Labour’s success in the capital but it also suggests that there is a growing divide between London and the rest of the country, where the party’s performance was decidedly less impressive. Of course, most of London is not super-rich. Indeed, there are many deep pockets of poverty in the capital, but they tend to be multi-ethnic and multicultural, and they too vote Labour. Nevertheless, the overall story of London in the past 40 years is one of economic growth that has propelled the capital away from the day-to-day experience of large parts of the nation. Caroline Knowles, a professor of sociology at Goldsmiths University, has written a book on plutocratic London called Serious Money. “There is undoubtedly a concentration of wealth in London,” she says. “A while back some of my colleagues made a diagram we called the Fat Bottom Diagram. It depicts wealth in the UK, and the south-east has this huge bulge.” In a crude sense, the political map of the UK has traditionally followed the distribution of wealth, with Labour doing well in poor areas, and Conservatives laying claim to richer constituencies. There have always been exceptions to the rule, but London as a whole now seems intent on demonstrating its exceptionalism. In the past, Labour’s wealthier supporters derived largely from the progressive middle-classes, that urban tribe that runs from social work through teaching to the creative industries and the law. The cliche of the metropolitan liberal elite is rooted in north London neighbourhoods like Hampstead and Islington, the natural habitat of the bien pensant professional. Although they are only a few miles away, they are a world apart from the suburban redoubt of Barnet, a Conservative stronghold that Labour had never won before Thursday. Equally, Wandsworth council had been staunchly Conservative since before Margaret Thatcher came to power. The Tories claimed a surprise victory in Harrow. Psephologists will be busy explaining these apparent anomalies, but whatever the local causes they form part of a global story. As the cultural commentator and co-author of The War Against the BBC, Peter York says: “People in large significant cities are more likely to vote liberal-left, and people in smaller towns or rural communities are more likely to vote conservative. That’s a rule right across America and Europe, and London is particularly subject to it because it is a supercity, a world city, the only world city in this country and really the only world city in Europe.” The question is whether the gravitational force of London’s size and prominence distorts the rest of country, putting its nose figuratively out of joint, or instead sets a path for it to follow. Is it a benign liberal influence or a self-obsessed bubble that antagonises everywhere else that isn’t London? York suspects that it’s a mixture of push and pull, but he believes that London is “completely out of whack with the rest of the country”. If that is an unhealthy position for a capital at the best of times, it’s even more troubling when there is a post-Brexit culture and identity war raging. The image that London is able to project, or has projected upon it, is itself a battlefront in the argument between populists and progressives. Take, for example, the collapse of what we might call the “Mayfair blue wall”. What does that signify? And how is it viewed outside the metropolis? The idea of hedge fund managers voting Labour – and York doubts that they did in any numbers – could well trigger provincial suspicions about the extent to which the party represents ordinary working people. Alternatively, it will give Conservatives pause for thought that a sector of society that has most benefited from Conservative rule – super-rich cosmopolitans – appears to have registered a protest against Boris Johnson’s party. “I think that the really wealthy don’t like this particular brand of conservativism practised by the Conservative government,” says Knowles. “It’s narrow, misogynistic, nationalistic and inward-looking. And it’s anti-Europe.” Although it’s not unique to London, Brexit and its aftermath continue to reverberate in the capital. There is a kind of cultural hangover rather than any meaningful political resistance, a deep-lying frustration at how Middle England has turned its back on Europe, leaving London cut off from the continent over which it increasingly viewed itself as the unofficial capital. Monique Roffey, the Trinidadian-born novelist who won the Costa book of the year award last year for The Mermaid of Black Conch, says most of the young Londoners she meets remain angry at the older generation, in particular the older generation from outside London. “They’ve de-Europeanised them,” she says, and the resentment at that altered status has not gone away. It’s hard to imagine that these are the issues being urgently aired in the cafes of South Audley Street, but it may be that Mayfair is less different to the rest of London than London is to the rest of the country, at least in terms of cultural identity. “The fact is London isn’t like anywhere else in the country,” says Knowles. “It’s like central Paris or Manhattan. They’re sort of islands that have more to do with each other than they have with the rest of their national hinterlands.” She believes that it has been a grave political mistake to allow this divide to grow. “The whole idea of levelling up, which doesn’t really work at all, has been a kind of grudging acknowledgment of that,” she says. London has long dwarfed other British cities, more so than any other European capital in relation to its provinces. Its disproportionate size has created a distinct political and cultural microclimate that has been intensified by the prevailing winds of globalism. London is not just a major city but a global one containing communities with origins in all corners of the planet. Today 40% of Londoners identify as non-white. The city’s once renowned regional accent or dialect, Cockney has all but disappeared, to be replaced by a hybrid sociolect known as multicultural London English. It’s as if a commitment to diversity and inclusivity has become encoded in the very language of the street. “It’s definitely more multicultural and tolerant,” says Roffey. “That’s why I’ve felt at home here as someone who’s bi-cultural. You can blend in. London is somewhere that’s dealt with and coped with immigration, absorption, riots, and more riots.” London, yes, but Barnet? It’s hardly the frontline. Say the name to most Londoners and it will conjure visions of a leafy comfort zone safely removed from the turmoil of the inner city melting pot. The reality is rather more complex. For a start, black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups make up 48% of the population. These are communities – aspiring middle-class immigrants and their descendants – to which the Tories have successfully laid claim in the past by emphasising their commitment to entrepreneurialism and laissez faire community politics. When he was mayor of London, Johnson had the political knack of appealing to many different ethnic groups, playing up his cosmopolitan credentials, but his government’s mood music has taken a discordant turn towards a more defensive and less open notion of Britain. That Labour can make inroads in places like Barnet suggests that the culture war which Johnson has been happy to tactically stoke has blown back in his face, at least in London. However, given the rocketing cost of living and the general sense of doom about events in the country, that may have paid dividends in limiting Conservative losses elsewhere. The problem is that there are two different national conversations going on – one within London and a few other urban centres and the other everywhere else – that never seem to interact. This kind of silo existence is familiar on social media, which encourages tribal thinking, but it’s also becoming a more firmly established geographical phenomenon. For York, so many of the exchanges that take place as part of this cultural skirmish are based on a false narrative. “When the Daily Mail bangs on about the imputed London-centric liberal elitism of the BBC, the fact is the BBC has 50% of its workforce outside London. Ask yourself, how much of the workforce of the Daily Mail is based outside London?” In any case, he argues, this tension between capital and provinces is an old story. “Someone said that all those novels and plays of the 1950s really boil down to people getting on a train at a provincial railways station and going to London,” he says. “It’s a cultural, aspirational history of Britain. It oughtn’t to be but that’s how it is.” Perhaps, but in political terms it’s the party that can ensure that it’s not a one-way journey that will prevail. Just as Labour has to work out how to speak to its urban supporters and its traditional constituency in a language that makes sense to both, so too do the Tories. It’s all very well bad-mouthing the metropolitan liberal elite or the inward-looking provinces but that’s not a recipe for winning round those communities. Although economic levelling up is the obvious long-term answer, that seems to be a commitment that is stalled in the rhetorical phase, forever postponed by the worsening economic forecast. In the meantime, London and Not-London have to make the effort to understand each other, appreciate their respective strengths and weaknesses, and stop thinking of the other as the root of the nation’s problems.",News/Politics,UK local elections: how London turned from blue to red,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/08/uk-local-elections-how-london-turned-from-blue-to-red
5/8/2022,"‘Gilded glamour” was the theme of last week’s Met Gala, the annual fancy dress party that has long been run, to generally adulatory international effect, by Anna Wintour, the magazine eminence. This year’s guests included Lila Moss, Brooklyn Beckham, assorted actors and influencers and first among countless Kardashians, Kim, the underwear magnate, squashed into the very dress in which Marilyn Monroe once sang Happy Birthday, Mr President. Wintour’s staff hailed Kardashian’s achievement in Vogue: “Orchestrating a style maneuver of this magnitude would require new levels of commitment and planning.” Thanks to Amy Odell’s exhaustive new book chronicling Wintour’s ascent to fashion and celebrity dominion – though she hopes to be remembered as a great philanthropist – we know that planning for the “gilded glamour” spectacle would have started immediately after last year’s gala. Much is made of Wintour’s meticulous involvement, vetting everything from the celebrities’ costumes to the appearance of the waiters and vegetables. So there’s even less excuse for it, really. Wintour could not have anticipated, of course, that her un-ironic emulation of the 19th-century gilded age, specifically of flashier profiteers whose (according to Vogue) “parties, balls, and soirées brought out the most extravagant style this country has ever seen”, would coincide with attempted genocide in Ukraine and a revived nuclear threat. And also, as it turned out, with the leaking of a proposal to overturn Roe v Wade. Not that there’s anything new about ostentatious partying in the face of other people’s adversity: in New York, as in Versailles, it’s practically a tradition. In 1966, ecstatic reporting of Truman Capote’s black-and-white ball easily eclipsed objections that Americans were dying in Vietnam while his friends were swanking around in bespoke rabbit masks. “The ball was a carryover from the 50s – the last time when people felt no guilt about expenditures and were not bothered by any serious social questions,” one guest, the late Isabel Eberstadt, recalled, long before Wintour’s, and in London Evgeny Lebedev’s, guests so enthusiastically proved her wrong. One soldier, says Capote’s biographer, Gerald Clarke, wrote to Time to complain about having to protect “this fat, lethargic, useless intelligentsia”. An objection that could anyway have no bearing, today, on Wintour’s guest list, one largely composed of well-exercised celebrities posing no intellectual threat to anyone. “God forbid if they’re fat, if they are unsightly, they have to go. That was absolutely a thing,” a Vogue staffer told Odell. It has been less easy for Wintour, running the gala since 1995, to edit parts of the museum she found ugly: when the 2,000-year-old Temple of Dendur could not be boarded up, she resorted to hiding it behind a stage on which Katy Perry performed. Donald Trump and Harvey Weinstein were, however, allowed – when in Wintour’s favour – to be starkly visible. Assuming the 2022 planning was too advanced for either thematic adjustment or any other hint of restraint or awareness when Putin began murdering Ukrainian civilians, the gilded glamour theme might already have looked tasteless, considering Covid and inflation, to a less formidably philanthropic host. On the other hand, Wintour could be confident that, with her blessing, crass excess would be indulged as per, even in an economic crisis and not only by her own publications. Nothing had deterred her after 2008. Each year, Odell says, “to make everything more impressive and more exclusive, the budget went up”. At the same time, previously spurned celebrities became cherished gala invitees and thus, thanks to Wintour’s influence, beneficiaries of heightened media respect for, say, their selfie or corset practice. As for the party, Tina Fey has recalled: “It’s just every jerk from every walk of life is there wearing, like, some stupid thing.” The gala’s worthier purpose is, via costly tickets, to fund the Met’s costume institute, renamed in 2014 the Anna Wintour Costume Center. Its staff “excel”, the museum says, “in the practices and theories of costume and textile conservation”. Even without all the other reasons to recoil, Wintour’s decision to make Kardashian in Monroe’s dress into the 2022 gala’s central stunt would be astonishing for putting celebrity before preserving cultural heritage – the ostensible point of the event. “Naturally, the big reveal tonight was nothing short of jaw-dropping,” Vogue promptly confirmed. But maybe not in a good way? It’s as if, for instance, Tristram Hunt invited the entire panel of Britain’s Got Talent, with plus ones, to help V&A furniture conservation by buying a night in the Great Bed of Ware. If Wintour’s choice of model, timing and event makes this an exceptionally striking lapse of judgment, Monroe’s fragile, beaded dress should not, the LA Times reported, have been worn again ever, for reasons both symbolic and physical. The dress speaks – spoke – of a historic moment, of a night four years before Capote’s black-and-white ball. It could be damaged by gravity along with perspiration, sunlight, temperature changes, humidity. Sarah Scaturro, formerly a conservator at the Met’s Costume Institute, told the paper: “My worry is that colleagues in historic costume collections are now going to be pressured by important people to let them wear garments.” Given Wintour’s continuing hold on her “kingdom”, as Odell calls it, with her proved power to make naked dresses a thing, such idiocy is not impossible. On the other hand, for a person whose influence remains (Odell again) “profound and unmatchable”, Wintour’s latest gala had a desperate, as well as tone-deaf quality. Is her primacy on the Met’s stairs – welcoming a junior Beckham, fresh from one of the most vulgar weddings in living memory – what all the dawn blow-dries and interminable ruthlessness were for? After Capote’s party, taken to be Wintour’s ideal, profiles of the famous often mentioned if they’d been there, his biographer says, “which was the irrefutable proof of their importance”. The way her galas are going, it could yet be Wintour’s achievement to offer her own guests the opposite.

5/8/2022,"Change happens slowly in the world of interiors. But even that sedately paced sector has woken up to the demand for online learning which began during the pandemic. From project management to kitchen plotting, skilful paint schemes to strategic lighting, you can now glean expert insights from architects, planners and top-flight designers from the comfort of your sofa. Sandra Harris can attest to their usefulness. Recently retired from a career in human resources, Harris had the time to redesign her “golden years home” in north London. With a granular grasp of detail and process, she wanted to manage the “back-to-brick” project herself. This included bolting on a loft extension and knocking out the back of the Victorian house. Clearly, professional help was required. “Not just for the planning, but also for all the 1,001 other aspects of doing a large build: the costs involved and how to allocate my budget; how to find the right architect, contractors and suppliers,” she says. Lesson one was in the art of compromise. Visions of a bespoke kitchen faded as Harris realised she and her husband would have to reserve their cash for the prosaic but more important details: “The flooring, glazing, the walk-in shower…” She learned all this on a course run by Riba-trained architects Jane Middlehurst and Amy Poulsom of HomeNotes. Spread over four weeks, the sessions (also recorded) were an eye-opener: ‘‘So many projects come off the rails because of money. The architect thinks you have X amount to spend. So does the builder. You have to be upfront about your budget,” says Harris, who interviewed 13 builders for her project (she says that years of working in HR helped in the vetting process). “On the course, we discussed what we wanted to achieve and how to work with an architect, and what qualities they needed for our project. I planned how we wanted the space to work for us. This is our forever home, so the bathrooms had to be future-proofed, the living rooms sociable. There was advice on designing storage – there is never enough of it in these old houses.” Next it was time to shed the chromophobia. “I’ve always been a devotee of grey, with shades of white.” This house is different. “It had to have zing, so that it doesn’t feel like a couple of 60-year-olds live here.” Most paint companies, such as eco-specialist Edward Bulmer, Little Greene or Paint & Paper Library, offer advice. A one-hour virtual session with a Farrow & Ball consultant was all it took to nail the palette. Only six colours were used. Little touches connect the four-storey interior: for example, a wash of celestial blue on the bedroom panelling is echoed in the nearby bathroom. “Everything feels cohesive.” Next, the fun stuff: shopping for sofas, rugs, lamps. During a series of 20-minute sessions with a designer at Create Academy, where they also run cookery, garden design and upholstery tutorials, Harris “extracted the principles of interior design”. There were tips on navigating auctions and plotting out rooms. She learned how to plan lighting circuits and how to “energise a plain room” with a judicious splash of pattern and to be bold with scale. “I used to pick up random bits and bobs without thinking about their size and how they’d work in the room.” Now a tape measure is a shopping-trip prerequisite. “A few, larger pieces work better than lots of smaller things.” The most encouraging lesson was the easiest. “It’s fine to mix your old vintage stuff with new pieces,” she says, pointing to the Ikea wardrobe and midcentury lights. “I’ve always been interested in interiors, but I’d never get rid of a sofa just because curved ones are in. I don’t follow trends. I like lots of styles.” The kitchen is another exercise in high-low resourcefulness (she tells me that they exceeded their budget by £1,500). Harris designed it herself using downloadable templates from DIY Kitchens, who then made the units. These were fitted by the builders, HL Workshops, who were chosen for their joinery skills. Harris used Google images to track down the vibrant, 1960s pendant lights over the island. “I uploaded a photo of the light I wanted and it came up with a list of dealers who had them.” One chichi site offered the lights at £1,000 per piece. “I paid £400 for three.” The sociably long dining table is a customisable design from Heal’s where you can specify size and finish. She sees her virtual education as part of a wider move to democratise interior design. “The price of materials has shot up. Finding contractors is getting harder. But access to inspiring design – through social media – has never been easier. Many of us want to make our homes look nice and reflect our style.” Zoom learning won’t make you a designer. That is a skill – and a talent. “But it will make you approach things differently and become more resourceful. It’s empowering.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Making a forever home: ‘It had to have zing’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/08/making-a-forever-home-it-had-to-have-zing
5/8/2022,"For all those who have occasionally wondered just what might lie behind the eternal sunglasses of the famously scary Anna Wintour, the author of a new biography of the longstanding editor-in-chief of American Vogue has momentous news: it seems that there is, after all, “a person there” (as opposed, you understand, to a robot programmed by the ghost of Oscar de la Renta). But while journalist Amy Odell has indeed found several witnesses willing to testify on the record to the existence of this corporeal being, she is, alas, unable to go much further; to explain what motivates Wintour, let alone to reveal what keeps her awake at night (assuming she can tell it’s the night). Her book might well be based on 250 sources and come with notes longer than the concordance to Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur. However, full disclosure, it is not – unless, of course, the reader was hitherto unaware that Wintour’s “ability to empathise is debated”. Debated! The word would come with all the wit and understatement of vintage Maison Margiela were it not for the fact that it is used completely without irony. Then again, its author’s refusal to poke fun at anything, however ludicrous, is also the only reason I enjoyed her book. If the pages (and pages) she devotes to Wintour’s assistants – young women who must not want to be writers and whose job it is to make sure that her full-fat latte and blueberry muffin (an item usually left uneaten) are waiting on her big, white desk every morning – are comprehensive to the point of tediousness, it’s hard not to laugh at her utmost seriousness, even when dealing with the mad and the risible. Having noted, for instance, that after the 9/11 attacks, Wintour went back to work immediately, she quickly adds that this was hardly unusual: after a facelift in 2000, she returned to the office – even more amazing! – with bruises still visible. Yes, Vogue’s staff were uncomfortable at being expected to do similarly, but they were also, thank goodness, able to make “one extraordinary step toward self-care” by wearing flats rather than heels “in case they had to run down the stairs”. Wintour has said that she relishes America’s classlessness, a statement that somewhat glosses the fact that she got her own start via her father, Charles Wintour, an Evening Standard editor. Having left her private school in London in 1966 – university was not for her – it was daddy who helped her to get a job at Harpers & Queen, where she started, sunglasses and bob already in place, as a fashion assistant aged 20 (the magazine’s then editor-in-chief knew her father). But this isn’t to suggest she was without gumption; ambition and a certain kind of tight-lipped stoicism are her chief characteristics, according to Odell. Furious at having been passed over for promotion at Harpers, five years later she headed to New York with her then boyfriend, where she eventually landed the role of fashion editor at a magazine owned by Bob Guccione, the founder of Penthouse. Viva was, she knew, a little on the tawdry side, but its fashion pages, dominated by “Siberian peasant outfits”, were also ripe for transformation. Wintour favoured models posed in country settings – hay, tractors, chunky sweaters – but she also liked “edge”. An issue of 1977 included an image in which a model in a baby doll dress and bonnet could be seen on her hands and knees being fed a bottle of milk by the man posing above her. Eat your heart out, Gloria Steinem. On she clambered. Stints at Savvy and at US Vogue in time led to her returning to London in triumph to edit British Vogue. But that title then, as now, was small fry compared with its Condé Nast stablemate, and after a disastrous period running House & Garden in New York, she finally stole American Vogue from under the nose of its beige-loving editor, Grace Mirabella, in 1988 – and there she has remained ever since, surviving every rumour, every advertising downturn, every editorial calamity. In addition to her role at Vogue, she is now Condé Nast’s chief content officer and artistic director. The moment of greatest peril came, arguably, when her glorious realm’s lack of diversity found itself under attack from the social justice movement in 2020, but she simply apologised and sailed on. Wouldn’t she rather, at 72, be spending time with her grandchildren, or playing tennis at her Long Island retreat? Or even – imagine it! – trying another, completely different job? Apparently not. I love fashion, in the sense that I like clothes (I’m writing this piece in a boiler suit, gold Birkenstocks and vintage Norman Hartnell jewels, if you don’t believe me); long ago, I was the deputy editor of a glossy magazine myself. But my disappointment with those whose self-appointed job it is to disseminate the activities of the industry and its stars grows incrementally, and Odell is no exception. While her interviewees assert all sorts of things about Wintour – the marvellousness of her taste; her brilliant sense of humour; the fact that her ex-husband, David Shaffer, was her “svengali” - only rarely does she back their statements with evidence. As for Wintour’s mean side, her proclivity for ghosting people, freezing their innards with silence (everyone knows about her fallout with André Leon Talley, once her cherished lieutenant), Odell has an alarming tendency to give sympathy to the undeserving.. In 2010, Wintour decided she wanted an interview with Asma al-Assad, the wife of Syria’s dictator president, whose look she apparently liked. The job was assigned to Joan Juliet Buck, a former editor of French Vogue and Wintour’s friend of five decades. All Vogue interviews are basically puff pieces, and this one, published just as the Arab spring was beginning, was no exception; Buck wrote breathlessly that Assad had won his country’s election with “a startling 97% of the vote”. When it was published, a horrified backlash naturally followed, soon after which Buck found that both her friendship with Wintour and her writing contract were at an end – a severing that, by Odell’s telling, comes off like a straightforward scapegoating when, in truth, you cannot put a paper between the repulsive indifference of either woman. They’re all in it together, these people, tied in a silk knot that this book, like so many others before it, does not even try to unpick.

5/8/2022,"John Stezaker has made collages, often using stills from film magazines from the 1940s and 1950s, throughout his career as an artist. This one comes from his latest exhibition Double Shadow at the Approach Gallery in London. He doesn’t always identify the silhouettes in his cutouts, but here the actor with the white-gloved hands on the deck rail has a name – Celeste Holm, the 1947 Oscar winner for her role in Elia Kazan’s Gentleman’s Agreement. Our guest editor, Jarvis Cocker, has been a fan of these coolly unsettling images – “I love them” – since Stezaker taught him on the film course at St Martin’s School of Art (Stezaker mostly remembers Cocker for his slightly patchy attendance record at his tutorials, as his music career began to take off). The pair of them share a kind of nostalgic fascination with the times into which they were born. “I often think of the world of these pictures as a parental world,” Stezaker, who was born in 1949, says. “The contours of male and female in the 40s and 50s were very well defined. And of course, those preview magazines make a great deal of silhouette contours. Often, the film stars were photographed against preposterous blue-sky backdrops.” Stezaker has been drawn again and again into finding ways to make those silhouettes dissolve or find new ways of interacting. It seems telling that his images mostly come from the pre-60s era. He wanted, he says, to find a way to shut out the “noise” of pop-art collage, trying instead to locate an intriguing stillness. Over the years, Stezaker has collected and unearthed the material for his pictures in boxes of postcards and magazines on market stalls and in junk shops. “But even so it always feels,” he says, “that the images find me, rather than me finding them.”",Arts/Art and design,The big picture: John Stezaker’s intriguing journeys into nostalgia,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/08/the-big-picture-double-shadow-john-stezaker-celeste-holm
5/8/2022,"The “red-wall” Tories may think Boris Johnson is their man, but for a long time Boris Johnson was the Conservatives’ political hero in a very different part of the country – London. With London Conservatives, Johnson claimed a famous victory, becoming mayor of the capital in 2008 and resurrecting a political career which was then at a low ebb. Four years later, against all the odds, he managed to see off a second Labour challenge. I was part of both campaigns as the then MP for Putney. We were the equivalent of Boris Johnson’s red wall Tories today. Back then he was our talisman. When his second term of office came to an end in 2016, it would have been impossible for activists in London to believe that just six years later, a Boris Johnson-led Conservative party would preside over such huge Tory election losses in London, seeing Labour take power over councils such as Wandsworth and Westminster for the first time in decades. But that’s exactly what has happened. And it’s worth reflecting on what the lessons are for a Conservative party seeking to win the next election – especially for red-wall Tories who might want to avoid the fate of London’s Conservatives. If it happened in the capital, could it happen to them? The answer to that question comes from understanding that Johnson’s victory in London came from building a political coalition with an appeal to the very diverse communities that make up our capital city. That is the only way any politician in London can stay elected – I won four elections in Putney by working hard across my very diverse local community, not by dividing it. In 2019, whatever the innate divisiveness of Brexit politics, Johnson ultimately won by constructing a political coalition that spanned the north and the south and reached into Scotland and Wales. Staggeringly, Labour gained just one seat from the Conservatives in England in 2019 – my own seat of Putney, when I stood down. Up against a Corbyn- and Momentum-led Labour party with a similar playbook, it was perhaps easy to lose sight of the fact that it wasn’t the culture wars and division politics of Brexit that actually took Boris to Downing Street, but the breadth of the voter coalition he had built, like no other Conservative leader since Margaret Thatcher. But last week’s local election results suggest that Johnson’s coalition is fracturing. And there are danger signs that the Conservative party risks writing off whole parts of the country – London, the south – and entire groups of people (such as graduates being hammered by student finance changes) as if they don’t matter. Ministers describing election results in London as “priced-in” wrongly talk about voters’ changing views as if they are simply share-price movements. It is to miss the clear messages that many are sending the Conservative leadership, which is “we matter too”. That all votes count, not just some. Dramatically swapping one core vote in the south for another in the Midlands and north is one thing. Finding the coalition beyond that core vote to win a general election again is another. Johnson must get back to his mayoral playbook of political coalition-building to win again. That means offering a levelling-up plan for the whole country, not just part of it. We need equality of opportunity for everyone in Britain, not just some. Johnson must aim higher to win – for a man never short of ambition, surely an easy fit. Few Conservatives could have won the London mayoralty as Johnson did. To win, he and the party must embrace London again, not write it off.

My partner, Emma, does everything else.I don’t remember the last time I picked up a duster. Sunday friends? We’ll often meet up with two or three other couples. I joke that it’ll soon turn into one of those ‘put your car keys in the bowl’ parties yet, but it hasn’t… yet. Sunday wind down? I’m usually in a comfy chair, glasses on, feet up, sipping a whisky, stroking my beard, doing my homework, reading a Margaret Atwood. Dread or love Monday mornings? If I’m not working, a typical Monday involves shower, ablutions and heading back to the pub to catch up with the old boys to discuss how well the gravy recipe went. Sunday nightcap? Maybe a little one. I’m glad TVs turn themselves off as I’ve been known to fall asleep on the sofa, whisky in hand. When someone tries to remove it, my grip tightens, for my own safety. Last thing before sleep? Usually just lie down. Normally works for me.

5/8/2022,"Universal access to abortion has been a constitutional right guaranteed to all women in the US since the 1973 supreme court Roe v Wade ruling. But in some states, this has been chipped away through stringent restrictions on abortion clinics and the doctors who practise in them. There is only one remaining abortion clinic in the whole of Mississippi, for example, making access to abortion a theoretical rather than a practical right for most women in that state. Now a conservative supreme court looks set to scrap this universal right, rolling back access to abortion for many more women across the US. A draft court ruling leaked last week, written by Justice Samuel Alito and reportedly supported by a majority of the court, would overturn Roe v Wade. It argues that it was “egregiously wrong” from the start in making this a constitutional issue and that laws on abortion should be determined by federal and state legislators rather than the supreme court. Several Republican states have already passed highly restrictive abortion laws in anticipation of this ruling, meaning most abortions will be illegal in around 25 states in the likely event the court overturns Roe v Wade. This is estimated to mean 18 million women of child-bearing age will be more than 200 miles from an abortion provider, effectively removing access for the many who cannot afford to travel. Forcing women to give birth after becoming pregnant, even in the case of incest and rape, would represent an extraordinary rollback of their reproductive rights in one of the world’s richest democracies. History tells us there is no way to ban abortion – only safe access to abortion. Women will always resort to dangerous methods and backstreet clinics to terminate unwanted pregnancies if there is no other way and some will lose their lives as a result. Restricting access to abortion is associated with higher infant and maternal mortality – and the US already has the worst rates among wealthier countries – and higher rates of poverty. Women who seek illegal abortions, and those who help them, could find themselves subject to the harshest of punishments; in Texas, anyone performing an abortion could be tried for murder and face a life sentence in prison. If the US restricts abortion rights, it will go against the international trends towards liberalisation of abortion, joining a small club dominated by countries such as Poland, where a rightwing authoritarian government has introduced the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe. There are some uniquely American factors that have left women’s reproductive rights exposed. American women have long enjoyed fewer rights than their British and European counterparts, for example in relation to pregnancy and maternity discrimination. The American religious right has long made overturning abortion rights through a conservative majority on the supreme court its key objective. And the fact that progressive presidents and legislators have never spent the political capital that would have been required to enshrine women’s reproductive rights in legislation means that Roe v Wade was always going to be vulnerable to challenge once the court swung rightwards. So much of women’s oppression is based on their reproductive biology: on taking away their choices, forcing them to continue with unwanted pregnancies and punishing them economically for having children. In the UK, a woman is killed by a man every three days, rape convictions are at a historic low and most women in prison are survivors of domestic abuse. What is happening in the US shows the danger of taking women’s rights for granted: what is hard won can also be lost.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on US abortion rights | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/08/the-observer-view-on-us-abortion-rights
