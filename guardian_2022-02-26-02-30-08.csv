2/26/2022,"Public health advice is no longer being followed under Boris Johnson’s ‘living with Covid’ strategy to end mass testing, senior civil servants have acknowledged in a leaked account of a cross-Whitehall briefing. The briefing by a senior member of the Covid taskforce was delivered to civil service leaders across Whitehall on Thursday afternoon, making clear that following public health advice is no longer the sole priority. The senior official said public health advice would not be met in NHS or social care settings in relation to the testing of staff, and that was a “decision that the PM, chancellor and indeed the cabinet have agreed to”. On the call, he said: “It will be the case from 1 April that testing in DH own settings including the NHS and adult social care will not fully match the public health advice because of spending considerations. We will not be testing adult social care staff or NHS staff at the frequency recommended by clinicians because there is not the funding to pay for it.” Johnson has repeatedly stressed throughout the pandemic that he would “follow the science” and listen to his public health experts. However, that appears to have ended with the ‘living with Covid’ strategy, which set out a timetable for winding down testing and scrapping mandatory isolation. The government has not published its public health advice from the UK Health and Security Agency but it is understood its advisers did not recommend winding down testing unless the prevalence of Covid was at a low level in the UK and that the pandemic was in a “steady state” near to endemicity. The government’s experts do not believe that state has currently been reached. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific officer, stood beside Johnson in a press conference as he announced the strategy but they struck a much more cautious note, urging people to carry on washing their hands and wearing face masks in enclosed spaces. The strategy to end mass testing was published after a row between Sajid Javid, the health secretary, who wanted up to £5bn more for testing, and Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, who insisted there would be no more cash after spending £15bn over the last year. The strategy ends most symptomatic and all asymptomatic testing for the general population, as well as for NHS staff. It will be decided over the next month whether very elderly people and some vulnerable will get free lateral flow tests if they are symptomatic. Medical settings should also get access to testing for symptomatic patients and care home residents as well as symptomatic social care staff. In the briefing, civil service officers were told there would not be additional funding from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) or the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) to cover testing in vulnerable settings overseen by their departments where there is a risk of outbreaks. This could include settings such as prisons, schools, children’s homes, detention centres, accommodation for asylum seekers and homeless shelters. Cabinet ministers will in future have to decide whether their budgets can stretch to additional testing in their areas and the senior civil service officials from departments across Whitehall were advised there was no expectation in future that they would follow public health advice in full. The senior official told them he was sure there would be “plenty of other areas across government where ministers decide on balance the funding does not exist to follow the public health advice in full when it comes to recommended testing protocols.” He made clear that the government was moving from a world where “public health advice is to be followed at all costs, and whatever the fiscal consequences money will be found to do exactly as clinicians recommend, towards a world where public health advice is one of several considerations to be taken into account and balanced decisions need to be made that consider public health advice but don’t necessarily follow it in all cases”. He added: “I think that is going to require a mindset shift across Whitehall.” A senior official on the Treasury Covid response was also present at the meeting, spelling out that it was considered acceptable for the public health advice on testing not to be followed in vulnerable settings. “Ministers [the prime minister, chancellor and chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster] are not expecting to be continuing testing in these types of setting in the main,” she said. Civil service officials on the call raised concerns that departments would find it difficult to make decisions about matters of public health on their own, weighing them up against financial considerations. There was also a worry that the costs of testing would have to continue to be absorbed by departmental budgets even if there were a new variant or spike. The Cabinet Office and Treasury had no comment on the leaked account of the meeting.",News/World news,"Government has abandoned its own Covid health advice, leak reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/government-has-abandoned-its-own-covid-health-advice-leak-reveals
2/26/2022,"Russia will no longer be allowed to compete in this year’s Eurovision song contest, with organisers saying its inclusion could “bring the competition into disrepute”. On Thursday, the European Broadcasting Union said Russia would still be allowed to compete, despite its invasion of Ukraine. But after pressure from broadcasters across Europe, the EBU have made a U-turn, publishing a statement on Friday stating the country would no longer be allowed to take part. In a statement, the EBU – an alliance of public service media organisations that produces the contest – said its executive board made the decision after a recommendation made by the Eurovision song contest’s governing body, based on “the rules of the event and the values of the EBU”. They said: “The decision reflects concern that, in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine, the inclusion of a Russian entry in this year’s contest would bring the competition into disrepute. “Before making this decision the EBU took time to consult widely among its membership. The EBU is an apolitical member organisation of broadcasters committed to upholding the values of public service. “We remain dedicated to protecting the values of a cultural competition which promotes international exchange and understanding, brings audiences together, celebrates diversity through music and unites Europe on one stage.” Statement from @EBU_HQ regarding Russia's participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 2022.https://t.co/HmKJdqVE4J pic.twitter.com/tVH6yFxzbq The EBU was criticised for its previous decision to allow Russia to compete, and had referred to the contest as a “non-political cultural event”, pointing out that both Ukraine and Russia would compete. SVT, the Swedish state broadcaster, had criticised this response and called on the EBU to review its decision. Ukraine’s state broadcaster, UA:PBC, also said Russia should be banned from the contest. Russia’s Eurovision delegation have not responded. This year’s Eurovision song contest will take place in May in Turin, after the Italian band Maneskin won last year’s competition. Ukraine have selected the group Kalush Orchestra to represent the country, with the band replacing Alina Pash, the original choice. Pash withdrew on 16 February after scrutiny over a trip she made to Crimea in 2015, which is annexed by Russia. Russia had not yet selected a contestant. The UK culture secretary said she was glad to see Russia had been excluded from the contest. Nadine Dorries tweeted: “Eurovision stands for freedom, unity and respect between countries – watched and enjoyed by tens of millions around the world. Glad to see Eurovision taking action and kicking Russia out.”",Arts/Television & radio,Russia is banned from Eurovision after invasion of Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/25/russia-banned-from-eurovision-after-invasion-of-ukraine
2/26/2022,"Economists are warning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will fuel a sharper rise in inflation, despite the rising cost of living having already hit the highest levels for three decades. With Russia the world’s biggest natural gas exporter and second-largest for oil, the stakes are high in a global economy still hooked on fossil fuels – drawing parallels with the Yom Kippur war and oil price shocks of the 1970s which led to galloping inflation and economic crises worldwide. Michael Strobaek, global chief investment officer at Credit Suisse, said the shock waves emanating from the Russian invasion amounted to the “dawn of a new world order” for the international economy, in which higher inflation and financial market volatility could be taken as given. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine marks nothing less than a shift away from the largely US/western-dominated world order that has prevailed since the fall of the Berlin Wall,” he said. There are several channels through which an inflationary shock will ripple around the world: European natural gas prices surged by almost 70% after the invasion of Ukraine, while the global oil price touched $105 for the first time since 2014. Although prices fell back on Thursday, they remain historically high – fuelling the prospect for a further rise in living costs. Some countries are worse affected than others. Across the EU, Russian gas accounts for 40% of the energy supply, although in some nations such as the Czech Republic and Latvia it rises to 100%. Germany has become more dependent on external sources of energy in the past two decades, rising to 67% – among the highest rates in the EU – as it scales back nuclear energy production. In terms of gas supplied from Russia, the country accounts for 65% of total natural gas imports in Germany, worth £52bn in 2020, according to Eurostat. France, which has a higher share of nuclear power, relies on imports for less than half of its energy by comparison. Russian gas accounts for little of the UK’s energy mix, at just 5% of total imports last year. However, the surge in global prices will still damage living standards in the UK at a time when consumers are already preparing for household gas and electricity bills to rise by 54% from April. UK inflation was expected to rise from the current 30-year high of 5.5% to a peak of more than 7% in April. Assuming a drop in wholesale energy costs and the government’s £200 repayable loan for households, inflation was expected to drop later this year. However, should the recent surge in prices be sustained, experts believe inflation would not peak at a higher rate in the short term, although would be likely to remain persistently higher for longer than first thought. City economists still believe gas exports will continue flowing, echoing the history of east-west tensions during the cold war when the Soviet Union continued pumping oil and gas to Europe. With Russia raking in $700m (£523m) each day selling oil and other commodities to the west, Putin has a strong interest in maintaining the flow, while the west has a strong interest in buying to avoid exacerbating the worst inflation shock for decades. Wheat prices have jumped to the highest level since 2008, threatening to push up food prices. Decades earlier the Soviet Union was the world’s biggest importer of wheat, with a record 55m tonnes bought in the mid-1980s. However, Russia overtook the US and Canada to become the world’s biggest exporter in the middle of the last decade. Ukraine – nicknamed the bread basket of Europe for its vast, fertile fields – is the fifth largest. Together, the two countries account for more than a quarter of the world’s supply, with Ukraine exporting 95% of its wheat through its Black Sea ports where Russian warships are pushing for control. Developing nations in north Africa and the Middle East are among the biggest buyers, meaning that a trade shock would devastate poor countries. Figures from the Observatory for Economic Complexity show in 2019 Egypt, Turkey and Bangladesh bought more than half of Russia’s wheat. Almost 85% of Egypt’s imports last year were from Russia and Ukraine. Transport Although soaring energy prices will provide the biggest source of inflationary pressure, fresh disruption to trade routes will add to costs and delivery times for companies – factors which have also contributed to higher consumer prices. Motorists, who have already had to pay record high petrol and diesel prices at UK pumps this year, are likely to see the direct, immediate pain. The RAC said a litre of unleaded touched an average 149.7p this week, with diesel at £1.53, but more increases were on the way with oil hitting $106 a barrel, as well as the pound weakening. Airlines have traditionally sunk or swum on the jet fuel price, with the highs of a decade ago tormenting an industry which had pared other costs back in offering low-cost fares. This specific conflict could have a particular impact on the shipping industry, which has already been buffeted by the container shortages, Covid and the blockage of the Suez canal. According to the International Chamber of Shipping, almost 15% of the world’s seafarers are Russian or Ukrainian, and supply chains and costs could be affected if the free movement of such a significant part of the labour force is restricted. Global financial markets thrown into turmoil by the invasion, wiping billions from the value of the FTSE 100 and triggering a flight to safe-haven assets such as the dollar and US government bonds. Economists expect the conflict will complicate decisions for global central banks to raise interest rates, with some analysts expecting they may push back planned hikes despite the situation adding to inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, there is still hope in the City of London that the crisis can be contained, reflected in a stock market rally on Friday after selling off sharply earlier in the week. Economists at UBS argue that financial conditions remain supportive for growth, despite expectations for an increase in borrowing costs. “Market expectations are for [Federal Reserve] policy rates to peak only at about 2% – this is hardly a ‘Volcker shock’, when the Fed hiked rates to 20% to subdue inflation,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS global wealth management. The consequences of a further squeeze on real incomes from an energy-fuelled inflation shock will mean higher rates of unemployment and lower global economic growth, at a time when the world economy is still grappling with the fallout from Covid-19. Even before the invasion the Bank of England forecast that higher rates of inflation and rising interest rates would bog down the recovery from Covid, with forecasts for a rise in unemployment and weaker rates of GDP growth next year. Goldman Sachs said financial markets were now pricing in the likelihood of global growth being 0.5 percentage points weaker this year than first expected due to the conflict, as rising energy prices depress production and squeeze consumption. Analysts said the Bank faced a dilemma over how to react. The central bank was widely expected to raise interest rates at regular intervals this year to curb soaring inflation. However, it may need to either go further or hold steady. While the conflict is expected to add to inflation by driving up global energy prices, the additional squeeze on household incomes is likely to slow the UK economy.",News/Business,How the war in Ukraine will fuel a sharp hike in inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/25/ukraine-russia-inflation-economy-oil-gas
2/26/2022,"Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Uefa’s Road to St Petersburg has reached an inevitable impasse. Big Cup final, which had been due to be staged at the Gazprom-O-Dome, has now been moved to Paris, what with European football’s governing body deciding that it would be prudent to delegate some unfortunate minion to sit in the basement of Uefa Towers and forlornly burst all their “white nights” of St Petersburg knockout stage official Big Cup match balls, boasting high-grade butyl bladders, out of existence. The final will now be held at the Stade de France on 28 May and Uefa has thanked Emmanuel Macron for his role in helping them make the change. “Together with the French government, Uefa will fully support multi-stakeholder efforts to ensure the provision of rescue for football players and their families in Ukraine who face dire human suffering, destruction and displacement,” droned a statement, which made no mention whatsoever of the fact that the Russian stadium it had just denied the right to host the final takes its name from a preposterously rich Russian state-owned energy corporation that also pays Uefa £34m per season in sponsorship. A follow-up statement, issued in the wake of public disquiet at its original policy of hoping nobody would notice it hadn’t mentioned its cosy relationship with Gazprom, declared “there” would be meetings of their executive committee soon, when “additional”, unspecified, “matters will be addressed”. While Uefa has stopped short of turfing Russian clubs and the country’s national team out of all their competitions, former Zenit St Petersburg chairman and Uefa board member Alexander Dyukov was still displeased. “We believe that the decision to move the venue of the final was dictated by political reasons,” he harrumphed. “The [Russian Football Union] has always adhered to the principle of ‘sport is out of politics’, and thus cannot support this decision.” A native of a country whose president has been mixing sport and politics in the interests of promoting soft power for more decades than The Fiver cares to remember, it has not gone unnoticed that Dyukov is the head of the RFU and also a high-ranking executive of – Fiver checks notes – Gazprom. Closer to home, it seemed that it was with a heavy heart that Manchester United eventually cancelled their £40m sponsorship deal with Russian airline Aeroflot in the face of much public opprobrium, announcing that “we share the concerns of our fans around the world and extend our sympathies to those affected”. The right thing to do? Undoubtedly, even if it did take a while for the rouble to drop. Following Thursday’s undignified silence on the matter, it was a far cry from the correspondence they sent one concerned season-ticket holder who had enquired about the relationship earlier on Friday. “In relation to the specific situation referred to in your email, we hope you can understand that, as a football club with fans from many different countries and cultures, Manchester United does not take positions on geopolitical issues,” it read.

2/26/2022,"Prominent Russians shocked by the invasion of Ukraine have gone public with their opposition to the war, despite the professional and personal risks that come with dissent on such a sensitive issue in Russia. More than 1,800 people were arrested at rallies across the country on Thursday night as prominent Russians from the worlds of entertainment, business and journalism have risked their livelihoods in order to speak out. When Elena Chernenko, the veteran diplomatic correspondent for Kommersant newspaper, found out that Russia was invading Ukraine, she said she was stunned. “Of course, I was shocked … Until yesterday morning, I refused to believe that Russia could launch a massive military operation against Ukraine,” said Chernenko, who believed Russia may at most recognise the territories in south-east Ukraine. “I thought that all the talk about invasions was awful hysteria. I argued with people on Twitter and in person that nothing would happen, it’s all thought up,” she said. “Maybe I don’t understand anything about Russian foreign policy anymore.” After Putin announced the military operation, she penned an open letter condemning the attack on Ukraine. “War has never been and will never be a method of conflict resolution and there are no excuses for it,” she wrote. Nearly 300 journalists have signed, including representatives of state-run media. In retaliation, she revealed she has been expelled from the diplomatic pool, which she has covered for more than 11 years, for “unprofessionalism”. Chernenko remains a strong critic of Ukraine’s policy toward the Donbas region, but said she could not justify the kind of military operation now unfolding. “There was nothing complicated about it for me,” Chernenko said of her letter. “It was a spontaneous reaction. My country has started a military operation against another … but we’re for diplomacy, we’re for the UN charter, moral values, brotherly nations, and all that. And I had the feeling that this is the wrong path.” Popular actors and musicians, some of whom are employed by the government, have also spoken out and appear to have been punished for their dissent. On Thursday, Ivan Urgant, the host of a popular talk show on state-run Channel One, posted a black square on Instagram with the caption “Fear and pain. No to war.” His show has not gone on air since. Channel One has claimed it is just a scheduling issue, although several reports in Russian media say that they have been blacklisted. Elena Kovalskaya, the director of the Meyerhold Center in Moscow, quit her job at the state-financed theatre in an act of protest over the war. “It’s impossible to work for a murderer and receive your salary from him,” she wrote of her decision. “Our future is being taken from us,” said Yuri Shevchuk, the frontman of classic Soviet rock band DDT and a veteran anti-war campaigner, who went to Chechnya in 1995 as part of a peace tour. “We’re being pulled like through an ice hole into the past, into the 19th, 18th, 17th centuries. And people refuse to accept it.” He pointed to those in show business who would usually avoid politics now coming out against the war. “Even those pop stars who never talked about politics, who were afraid to lose their shows, honorariums, and so on.” They include mainstream stars like Valery Meladze, as well as more politically-minded artists like the rapper Oxxxymiron. He voluntarily cancelled six sold-out shows in Moscow and St Petersburg, writing: “I cannot entertain you when Russian missiles are falling on Ukraine.” Even the family members of some of Russia’s richest businessmen have gone public in their opposition to war. The daughter of Roman Abramovich posted an Instagram picture that read “Putin wants a war with Ukraine,” crossing out the word Russia. “The biggest and most successful lie of Kremlin’s propaganda is that most Russian stand with Putin.” And on Friday afternoon, Lisa Peskova, the daughter of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, took to Instagram to post a simple message on a black background: #Нетвойне, or “No to war.” So did Tatyana Yumasheva, the daughter of Boris Yeltsin. While the acts of dissent may not change Kremlin policy, they could point to significantly less public or elite support for the current military operation in Ukraine than the annexation of Crimea eight years ago. Hours after Putin announced the military operation, protests broke out on the streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg and more than 50 other Russian cities on Thursday evening. They were not the largest protests that Moscow has ever seen. But they were remarkable as a show of defiance despite threats that the government would crack down harder than usual. “Not only did they go to war without us, they won’t even let you protest against a war,” said Zhanna, a young woman with her hair dyed green, pointing to police in riot helmets. “But war is never right. I need to be here because I feel ashamed.” One young man held up a sign that said “Fuck the war!” Within seconds, four police officers had fallen on top of him, dragging him roughly to a police van as media and photographers crowded around. That scene repeated itself dozens of times, as protestors mostly waited their turn for police to arrest them. As the protesters were pushed off the square, they began to march down the broad sidewalk of Tverskaya Street, chanting “No to war.” A number of protesters said that they wished more people had come out in opposition to the war, a remark echoed by political analysts. “The government can put down nearly any protest at this point,” said Tatyana Stanovaya, the founder of R.Politik. “And in order for the situation to become serious, many more people would have to come out than did so yesterday.” Despite the odds stacked against them, many Russians have said they feel it is their duty to speak out whatever the consequences. “They are all doing this without worrying about their own future and threats,” said Dmitry Muratov, the Nobel prize-winning editor of Novaya Gazeta. “These people have all spoken very clearly to say that they are against this bloodshed. And that is very inspiring for me.” Muratov released dual editions of his newspaper in both Russian and Ukrainian this week and has said that his newspaper would defy the Russian media watchdog’s rules that they only report official government information about the war, trusting reporting only from their own newsroom. He believes the war is an unpopular one for most Russians. “The memory of the [second world] war, and that people have relatives in Ukraine, and that Ukraine is a dear country to us, it holds back even the most rabid supporters of the current leadership,” said Muratov. “There is no enthusiasm for this.”",News/World news,"Prominent Russians join protests against Ukraine war amid 1,800 arrests",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/prominent-russians-join-protests-against-ukraine-war-amid-1800-arrests-putin
2/26/2022,"In addition to the foreign policy mistakes listed by Timothy Garton Ash (Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will change the face of Europe for ever, 24 February), we should acknowledge the serious error of western powers, in particular America and Britain, who responded to the collapse of communism in eastern Europe in 1989-90 with a spirit of triumphalism. The ensuing humiliation and isolation felt by the Russian people was exactly the sort of climate would-be nationalist demagogues are able to exploit to dangerous effect, and Vladimir Putin’s egregious attack on Ukraine is now an outcome for which we in the west are, at least partly, responsible. There will come a time – though it is unlikely to be soon and the task may not initially be easy, given the newly kindled fears and suspicions of eastern European states – when the fall of Putin gives the west an opportunity to begin to build a much more positive and cordial relationship with Russia. This is something many of its currently suppressed citizens would warmly welcome. We should be especially mindful of the mistake we made 30 years ago when that chance arises.Dr Gerald DunningTonteg, Pontypridd  Whatever European politicians might say, they cannot disguise the fact that they are unwilling to take action to prevent aggressive Russian incursions into their homeland. The events leading up to the invasion seem suspiciously similar to the appeasement of Hitler. It was a no-no for western countries and Nato to help Ukraine equip its armed forces against possible Russian aggression, for fear of upsetting Vladimir Putin. Perhaps Germany’s offer of 5,000 protective helmets symbolises the weakness of the European approach. Although through inaction the west has made it almost impossible to offer help to Ukrainians, it has a moral obligation to do so. The west must not repeat the humiliation of Budapest in 1956, when, having encouraged the Hungarians to rise against the Communist government, it did nothing to help when the Russian tanks rolled into Budapest. Timothy Garton Ash is right that the west must act to prevent similar incursions in future. However, can European politicians rise to the occasion and take the necessary action to curb Putin? Looking at British politics, I can only see the unlikelihood of the necessary pan-European action being taken. At present, our politics is dominated by an insular, Europhobic Conservative party and government in thrall to the City of London and Russian money. Not the politicians capable of leading, or being part of, an effective collaborative effort to restrain Russia.Derrick JoadLeeds  When nations are backed into a corner, they eventually lash out. Hitler was Germany’s disastrous response to the onerous war reparations inflicted by the first world war victors. Vladimir Putin is Russia’s disastrous response to the triumphal advance of Nato and the EU across the old Soviet fiefdoms of eastern Europe. Nelson Mandela, uniquely, understood that it is crucial for victors to be magnanimous, to offer friendship to those they defeated, and thus seek to avoid renewed conflict. We have not learned from him. Putin is a monster. But we, the west, were the midwives at his birth.David AllenNottingham  Finally, after dithering as usual, the prime minister has had to recognise reality, admitting that “this is a catastrophe for our continent”. He now appears to align the United Kingdom with the continent of Europe and to recognise the need for unified action. What a pity he didn’t accept that before tearing apart one of the most useful alliances in history. No one is going to pay attention to this country on its own, and we are hardly going to achieve peace with two of the most heinous liars in the world dealing with the situation.Larry JohnstonBrecon, Powys  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/26/2022,"The History Channel is broadcasting live. The US commentator who made that quip meant that events currently unfolding in Ukraine will be remembered for many decades to come, that future generations of schoolchildren will be called to memorise the date of 24 February 2022. But it’s true in another, darker sense too. For this is a grimly retro war. Russian troops marching across an international border, closing in on a European capital? Families sheltering in underground stations, children parted from their fathers, civilians donning uniforms and reaching for rifles, vowing to fight to the death for their homeland? An actual invasion of one European country by another? Footage of such events looks strange in colour: it should be in grainy black and white. Because Europe was meant to have left such events behind, if not in the 1940s – when the Nazi bombardment of Kyiv began at 4am one day in 1941, rather than the 5am hour chosen on Thursday by Vladimir Putin – then later in the 20th century, when Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest in 1956 or Prague in 1968. Instead, history is back – confronting us with a choice we imagined we’d made long ago. The choice was set out as starkly as it could be, by the leaders of the two countries now locked in uneven combat. Putin spoke twice, his first address repeatedly described as rambling and incoherent, but no less chilling for that. Between the two appearances, Putin set out a justification for invasion that, naturally, rested on lies. He claimed Moscow had to invade, to save eastern Ukraine’s Russian speakers from a genocidal threat that did not exist. He would rescue Ukraine from rule by “neo-Nazis”, an odd way to describe a country whose president and prime minister are both Jews, both democrats. But underneath the spurious defences lay the Putin worldview. His objection was not, as Putin’s western apologists on the far right and far left would have it, merely to Nato expansion, but something rather more fundamental. Putin argued that Ukraine was not a proper country, implying that of the states born out of the collapsed Soviet Union, only one was real and legitimate: Russia. All the rest were confections, whose right to exist was hazy and to be determined by Putin himself, by force of arms if necessary. Taking him by his word and by his deeds, Putin believes he has the right to redraw the map of Europe, and to do so in blood. Not long afterwards, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy also addressed the Russian people, and he too spoke in Russian. It was a speech for the ages, one that deserves to be read now and long after this crisis is over. For it did not just plead his people’s case, though it did that: “Lots of you have relatives in Ukraine. You know our character, our principles, what matters to us.” It did not just make the case against all wars: “People lose their loved ones and themselves.” It specifically set out the principle at stake: “international law, the right to determine your own future”. This, then, is the choice. Do we want to live in the world described by Zelenskiy, where democratic states are protected by an international system of rules, however flawed and inconsistent that system might be? Or do we want to live in Putin’s world, governed by the law of the jungle and where the only right is might? We think we know which side we’re on. We want to stand with those bleary-eyed children, clutching their colouring books as they bed down in a Kyiv subway station. We tell ourselves we stand with them and against Putin and his war of aggression. But do we? Because Putin had hardly kept his worldview secret until now. On the contrary, he had acted on it at least three times in the past 15 years, each time paying little price. He seized a chunk of Georgia in 2008 and of Ukraine in 2014, to say nothing of his decision to adopt the Assad regime’s murderous war against the Syrian people as his own a year later. We may have forgotten about all that – the Russian dissident Garry Kasparov laments the “amnesia of the west” – but Putin had not. He noted the western shrug that greeted his annexation of Crimea: how, just four years later, Russia was cheerfully hosting the football World Cup. There was no beefing up of Ukrainians’ defences, so that they might protect themselves against this moment. There was no clearout of oligarch money from Londongrad. Putin understood the signal: it was a green light. And what are we proposing to do to stop him now, even as he invades his neighbour? The latest rounds of economic sanctions are hardly crippling, not when Moscow has friends, starting with China, that are willing to soften the blow. But even if the measures were stronger, there’s no guarantee they would work. Both Bashar al-Assad and the regime in Tehran have faced sanctions for years; they’re still standing, their behaviour barely changed. The problem is an obvious one: Putin does not care if his people suffer. He’s priced in the hit to his oligarch pals, just as he’s priced in the loss of Russian military lives. For him, conquering Ukraine – and removing the example of a democratic neighbour that might show Russians a different life is possible – is worth it. But if confronting Putin economically is ineffective, confronting him militarily is barely plausible or palatable. The Russian dictator was at pains to remind the west that his is a “powerful nuclear state”. Analysts say that Putin does not see Russia’s nuclear capability as theoretical: it is absorbed into his military strategy. No one would want to tangle with such a man, not least as he seems to drift ever further away from stable rationality. Apparently modest options – perhaps enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine – run into the same problems: it would mean Nato being at war with Russia. We can hope for a palace coup against the tsar. We can send our solidarity and admiration to those Russian anti-war protesters brave enough to take to the streets, hoping they might somehow topple the autocrat ruining so many lives. But these are no more than wishes. The grimmer prospect is that Putin understands something about the 21st century few of us want to face: that this is an age of impunity, especially for those who have a vast and deadly arsenal but no shame. That is what’s at stake in this moment. Beijing understands it: if Russia can take Ukraine, why can’t China snatch Taiwan? Kseniia understands it too. She is the young Kyiv resident who, after a night in a subway station, told the BBC: “We are like a shield for Europe and for the world. We fight for the freedom of the world.” She is right – and yet she, and her country, are terribly alone.

2/26/2022,"Charlie Brooker’s Cat Burglar has plenty going for it. As a celebration of maximalist mid-century, Tex Avery-style animation, it’s just about as genuine as love letters get. In terms of animation – and especially in terms of sound – it is a wild success. Where it falls down, however, is with its interactivity. Intermittently, Cat Burglar grinds to a halt so that you can answer a pointless trivia question. This element of interactivity is wearying and repetitious, taking a brilliant idea and needlessly diluting it to the point of tedium. What’s so infuriating is that Netflix is capable of creating much more engaging interactive work – but most of this work is aimed squarely at children. While interactive stories for adults are still treated as a novelty – with the only real efforts being Brooker’s Black Mirror: Bandersnatch and a special episode of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt – Netflix has been quietly carving out an entire library of them for children. From a practical viewpoint this makes total sense – kids love repetition and the illusion of control, so engagement data for this sort of storytelling must be through the roof – but the happier news is that some of these shows are really, actively, surprisingly brilliant – and just as much fun to play as an adult. If you have several afternoons to waste, these are the five best titles you should be seeking out. A wilderness survival series that has already spawned spin-offs and movies, You vs Wild puts you in control of none other than Bear Grylls. Dropped into one of many exotic locations, your job is to guide him to safety via a number of critical decisions. What’s great about You vs Wild is that it has multigenerational appeal. Put a kid in charge and (in my experience) they’ll treat each mission like it’s a national emergency, with Grylls’s safety being of the utmost importance. Meanwhile, if an adult has a go, they will almost certainly attempt to Mr Bean him into a series of catastrophes, with all the casual cruelty of someone who places no real value on human life. It is outstanding. The Buddy Thunderstruck series about the adventures of a truck-racing dog, came and went five years ago without making much of an impact. And this is a shame because, as a pleasingly tactile stop-motion animation, there wasn’t really a lot else like it out there. Its final hurrah was arguably its best and the interactive episode, The Maybe Pile, is essentially a loose grab-bag of sketches, where the characters make a series of bad decisions that tend to resolve themselves with some level of gastrointestinal catastrophe. Part Wes Anderson and part Lonely Island, this is a real lost gem. It was inevitable that Netflix’s revived Carmen Sandiego series would go interactive. After all, the character first existed in a video game almost 40 years ago, so a level of control comes baked in. To Steal or Not to Steal doesn’t mine as much comedy from its interactive premise as the other shows on this list, but that’s to its credit. It’s a tight, animated spy thriller. The Boss Baby movies aren’t exactly held up as high art. And perhaps that’s why its interactive special plays so fast and loose with the form. Get That Baby! is essentially a job interview within a simulation within the Boss Baby universe. Depending on how you fare in a number of scenarios – fighting bad guys, participating in logic tests, chasing babies around haystack mazes – you end the episode being awarded with one of 16 Baby Corps jobs. What’s wonderful about this is that it really takes time to lead the viewer by the hand through the options, which means that you can find yourself glued to it for hours. And now, the greatest success in Netflix’s interactive experiment so far. Dav Pilkey’s Captain Underpants books were riotous to begin with, but the ensuing Netflix series – equal parts jittery, restless and madcap – pushed their boundaries to the limit. Epic Choice-o-Rama was yet another leap forward. As a story, it’s all over the place, but its refusal to sit still for even a moment means that the interactivity often leads to genuinely unpredictable outcomes. There are changes in animation styles, leaps to invented TV shows, brutal dead ends and all manner of logic-defying mayhem, and it’s all presented with a knowingly silly wink to the viewers. Forget the kids and fire this up next time you get a minute. It’s a thing of beauty.",Arts/Television & radio,"‘Really, actively, surprisingly brilliant’: the Top 5 interactive shows on Netflix",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/25/really-actively-surprisingly-brilliant-the-top-5-interactive-shows-on-netflix
2/26/2022,"The war against Russia is one western countries want to fight with only economic sanctions, not guns. Russia’s conflict with Ukraine, despite its long gestation and planning by Vladimir Putin and his supporters in the Kremlin, was supposed to end quickly once financial retaliation began. Yes, there would be military skirmishes on the ground, but little more than a few casualties were expected once a range of penalties began to bite. The western powers have quickly realised that unless they are willing to fire the financial equivalent of a nuclear arsenal, Putin has made sure Russia is largely immune, at least in the short term. Over a decade, Kremlin policy has carefully reduced domestic public and private sector debt and allowed the central bank time to build a war chest of foreign assets large enough to shore up the countries finances for months, if not years. This means that the sanctions put in place over the past couple of days by the EU, US, UK, Japan and Canada are unlikely to have any significant effect on the Russian economy or its financial stability. Only the full package of measures used against Iran – shutting Russia out of the international payments system, Swift, while also banning purchases of Russian oil and gas – will do the trick. As Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, the head of the European Centre for International Political Economy, said, Europe has allowed itself to become more integrated with Russia, while Russia has separated itself from Europe. He said EU countries owned a combined €300bn of Russian assets that would be vulnerable to confiscation if a full-blooded financial war broke out. The UK owns billions more via firms such as BP, which has a near-20% stake in the Russian oil company Rosneft. “Sanctions are one of the few options that European countries have in a conflict situation like this. If you disconnect North Korea or Iran from the international financial system, you do not expose yourself to that much damage.” Speaking on BBC News, he added: “But while I don’t say it is impossible to envisage Russia being barred from the Swift system, it is a nuclear option that means you exterminate yourself along with your enemy.” Swift (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the main secure messaging system that banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, allowing international trade to flow smoothly. It transmits trillions of dollars’ worth of deals every day, but is coming under pressure from a Chinese government-backed rival, Cips, which Russia could use to conduct its financial business deals supplemented by direct transactions with counterparties. It is also possible for the G7 countries and EU to ban the purchase of Russian gas and oil, but commodities analysts agree that while there is spare capacity in oil markets to make up for the loss of Russian supplies with a price rise limited to $140 a barrel, there is no hope of boosting gas output to fill a gap created by a Russia ban. Shortages would quickly force countries in Europe to ration gas and the price would be likely to rocket back to nine times normal levels, as seen before Christmas, stirring memories of the 1974 oil price shock. Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said that while some countries – the Czech Republic and the Baltic states – had pushed for bans on Russian gas, “others are more reluctant and it would presumably take much more devastating developments in the conflict to trigger such measures”. Tom Mayne, a Russia expert at the thinktank Chatham House, said there was room to improve the current sanctions that allow a Russian kleptocracy access to London’s financial markets. In a report last year, the thinktank said an effective anti-kleptocracy drive would “close legal loopholes, demand transparency from public institutions, deploy anti-corruption sanctions against post-Soviet elites and prosecute British professionals who enable money laundering by kleptocrats”. Even the ramped-up sanctions announced by Boris Johnson fall short of this effective ban on illegal Russian money entering UK economic life. The UK is keen to go further than the EU with restrictions on Russian energy imports, but the EU has allowed itself to be much more dependent than the UK, limiting its appetite for further sanctions. Without bans on gas and oil exports, and expulsion from international payments systems, the impact of sanctions will be limited.",News/World news,Western powers have realised Russia is largely immune to sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/western-powers-have-realised-russia-is-largely-immune-to-sanctions-ukraine-putin

2/26/2022,"Boris Johnson speaks of “protecting ourselves without losing our liberties”. This is frighteningly ridiculous. If you are Covid positive and don’t self-isolate, or you refuse to wear a mask in a crowded, poorly ventilated environment, then the risk is all on me. You will, in fact, be reducing the likelihood of my being able to protect myself and with it increasing the likelihood that I will lose my liberties. I behave responsibly, and care about other people’s health. Should I catch Covid, it would never occur to me to risk the health of others by continuing as I was doing (so-called exercising my liberty) and running the risk of infecting others (who would have every right to be angry with me if I knew beforehand that I was Covid positive). Covid infection prevalence throughout the country is still extraordinarily high. Johnson speaks as if he has unilaterally decided that the pandemic is over. He is far from an expert, as his government’s record demonstrates. Bluntly, he has no clue as to the direction of this disease. I am deeply shocked at the rhetoric and complete absence of logic.Dr Michael SheardNorthallerton, North Yorkshire  It sounds very attractive that “daily case numbers have fallen to about a fifth of the record peak at the start of 2022” (Johnson to say ending Covid rules in England is a ‘moment of pride’, 20 February), but it is deceptive. Government reported case numbers depend on the availability of tests, people being willing to take tests and then being prepared to report the result. Much better measures come from the Zoe study and the Office for National Statistics. The government figures for hospitalisations and deaths are reliable and pointing in the right direction; its figures for cases are no longer meaningful.David DaviesSalisbury, Wiltshire  Boris Johnson prefers people to take personal responsibility for their Covid-preventive behaviour rather than being legally required. Putting to one side the important concern for those who lack the means for such responsibility, we may ask how far does he want to go. Will he shortly be repealing those laws that instruct us to wear safety belts, drive on the left and stop at red lights? Are restrictions on firearm ownership, animal mistreatment and health and safety regulations also to be abandoned? Of course, public safety and animal welfare are at issue with those suggestions, but then so is public safety where Covid behaviour is concerned.Peter CaveLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

What has been lacking has been a clear strategy for addressing these overwhelming problems. One difficulty may be that the services required are not biomedical but psychological and involve social services. Neither senior nor NHS local management have begun properly to integrate these services into their planning. As the December 2021 update to the NHS psychological professions workforce plan for England commented, it “shone a spotlight on the psychological professions specifically because of the massive growth required in those occupations and because the unique contribution of these diverse roles is not widely understood”. Training additional staff will take years. Four steps could be taken that will make a rapid difference. First, appoint a chief psychological professions officer at national level. Second, require service commissioners to identify a consultant clinical psychologist to provide them with advice concerning psychological disorders, therapies and service organisation. Third, require NHS trusts to maximise the effectiveness of their psychological services by ensuring that they are led by a consultant clinical psychologist and all providers of psychological therapies are adequately supervised by clinical psychologists. And last, minimise the loss of qualified psychological therapists from the NHS by providing funded career pathways.Bernard KatDirector, Association of Clinical Psychologists UK  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/26/2022,"Reading the founder of the Positive Birth Movement, Milli Hill, denounce Adam Kay’s book This Is Going to Hurt as “blatantly disrespectful towards women” (‘Childbirth as it really is’: This Is Going to Hurt actor defends series accused of misogyny, 18 February), my feminist antennae went on red alert. Here were accusations of “women’s trauma being played for laughs” and Rachael Dewey, a community midwife, declaring that the show “demeans women’s experiences/bodies”. I read Kay’s book in May 2020. Had I missed something? I immediately reread my copy. I see no misogyny or demeaning of women, and I delight in the explicit anti-racism and how the narrative confronts homophobia. The humanity of the book (and the TV adaptation) is indisputable. It tackles the complexity of lives and identities in an institutional setting in the context of the political culture of the time. While everyone (apart from the consultants) is a victim of underfunding, understaffing and overworking, they are also survivors, working together to do the best job they can. And shared humour is part of that process. Driving the book and the script is the effort to understand and a commitment to do justice to people’s experiences and lives. Such humour does not make light of difficulty or injustice, but involves a creative processing of experiences and relationships, including distress, failure, grief, violation, bullying and anger. Has Kay added to our understanding and our sense of humanity? Has he illuminated our vulnerability and frailty? Yes. This is no act of exploitation.

2/26/2022,"Protesters gathered in High Wycombe on Friday to implore their MP, Steve Baker, to quit as a trustee of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a thinktank that has been accused of being one of the UK’s leading sources of climate scepticism. Christians from the MP’s constituency prayed and sang Amazing Grace outside the constituency office, holding signs reading “Praying 4 Steve Baker”, “The Earth is what we all have in common”, “… And God created science”. Baker is an evangelical Christian. Ruth Jarman, from Christian climate action group Operation Noah, led those assembled in prayer. She said: “I didn’t realise there was a connection between my faith and my environmentalism until I was in my 30s. I was walking down the street and suddenly remembered the first line of the Bible that states ‘in the beginning, God created the Earth.’ “We are knowingly trashing what God has made. That’s a hugely terrifying thought, really. I understand why some people have not made that connection, I’m here praying that Steve Baker makes that connection.” Those assembled, including local children and members of the local Lib Dem, Labour and Green parties, said they hoped the MP would be voted out at the next election if he did not change his mind on net zero. Baker currently has a majority of 4,000, which means his seat could be marginal. The MP, who is a member of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group and has called for the government to rethink its policy of decarbonising the economy using renewable energy, came out to join the gathered protesters in prayer and answer their questions. He said he has no plans to leave the GWPF, which he joined at the behest of Lord Lawson, who has claimed that global heating is not a problem. Baker told those gathered that though he believes meeting net zero is an admirable goal, “the way we deal with it has got to be politically and socially and economically viable”. The Guardian recently reported that the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG) of 19 Conservatives was accused of attempting to derail the government’s green agenda, linking it to the cost-of-living crisis and leading to fears of a “culture war” campaign around net zero. The NZSG, which has gained widespread media coverage despite being small in number, says it does not dispute climate science or the need to decarbonise. It has called for cuts to green taxes and an increase in fossil fuel production to address the energy crisis. Though he said he believes lowering emissions is important, Baker told the Guardian that he thinks the government’s policy on renewables will pass on unacceptable costs to constituents, and he hopes to change the mind of his colleagues – and that of the country. “I think [reaching net zero] means nuclear. I think that means gas, with Allam cycle, probably, which means a closed cycle.” Allam cycle is a way to build gas plants, currently in test phase, that can theoretically capture 100% of the carbon it emits. He added that we need to be “honest about the cost of renewables”. “I do think that there are mistakes being made about the cost of renewables. There are billions of pounds a year of subsidy going into renewables. And yet we’re saying that they’re cheap.” However, a comparison of subsidies since 2020 by Energy Policy Tracker found the UK had spent significantly more on fossil fuels than on renewable energy. The campaign to change the government’s net zero policy will be “bigger than Brexit”, according to the MP – who chairs the influential European Research Group, credited for pushing the government towards a hard Brexit. “I think this is going to be far bigger than Brexit,” Baker said. “With Brexit it was always a minority issue on both sides. But the soaring cost of net zero and what it’s going to mean for people’s houses and for their cars and for their holidays, and for the way the economy functions … I mean, you don’t have to believe me, it was the chief scientist who said, we will have a transformation at all levels of society.

Jota and Firmino have missed Liverpool’s past two games as a result of ankle ligament and adductor injuries respectively and the Brazil international has not recovered for the club’s first Wembley final since 2016. The Portugal international, instrumental in Liverpool’s run to the final, faces “a challenge” to be fit, according to the assistant manager, Pepijn Lijnders, although his rehabilitation work will continue in the buildup. A forward line of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané and the new signing Luis Díaz has scored nine goals in the two games without their fellow forwards. Lijnders said: “Bobby is pushing himself really hard but he will not be available for the final. We hope he will be back really soon because you all know how important he is for our way of playing, so I am happy that he is pushing himself.

He’s learning from the best keeper in the world day in, day out, which will help him. “He’s always had that calmness about him; even when he makes big saves he has that calming presence about him which I really like.

As reactions poured in from both sides of the political aisle, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, shared his support via Twitter: “With her exceptional qualifications, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will be a Justice who will uphold the Constitution and protect the rights of all Americans, including the voiceless and vulnerable.” “This is a historic day for women, for BIPOC representation, and for our Judiciary,” tweeted Florida representative and co-chair of the Democratic Women’s Caucus Lois Frankel. Progressive Massachusetts representative Ayanna Pressley also added her voice, tweeting: “Bold. Principled. Qualified. Dedicated to justice. POTUS has met the moment with the historic nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson and we must have swift confirmation.” “233 years. That’s how long we have waited to have a Black woman nominated to the Supreme Court,” wrote Missouri representative Cori Bush about Jackson’s nomination. “There are no words to describe how my soul is moved by witnessing her nomination.” Progressive advocacy groups similarly shared their congratulations. “We need a justice on the bench who will uphold reproductive freedom. This historic nomination is a chance to shape the Court for decades to come,” tweeted the pro-choice group NARAL Pro-Choice, alluding to important abortion cases that the supreme court has heard recently, including the Texas abortion ban and an upcoming case that will decide the fate of Roe v Wade. Some Republicans seemed notably less joyous about Jackson’s nomination, following on their complaints that race and gender should not play a role in the selection process despite similar commitments from past Republican presidents. “If media reports are accurate, and Judge Jackson has been chosen as the Supreme Court nominee to replace Justice Breyer, it means the radical Left has won President Biden over yet again,” tweeted South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, adding that Democrats potentially blocked the nomination of Judge J. Michelle Childs. Childs, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, had notable bipartisan support from her state’s congressional delegation due to her non-Ivy league education and judicial reputation.

2/26/2022,"One day Goethe called on his fellow-writer, Friedrich Schiller, only to find that he had gone out. Informed that he would return shortly, he went to Schiller’s writing-table to jot down a few notes and was sickened, almost to the point of fainting, by the smell coming from one of the table-drawers, which he discovered to be full of rotten apples. ‘I immediately went to the window,’ Goethe later recalled, ‘and inhaled the fresh air, by which I felt myself instantly restored. In the meantime his wife had re-entered, and told me that the drawer was always filled with rotten apples, because the scent was beneficial to Schiller, and he could not live or work without it.’ One person’s aid to writing may be another’s poison, and anyone offering practical hints for writers would do well to remember this. Even so, a few suggestions may be helpful. Set aside a dedicated working space, preferably one that allows you to leave your writing materials in place when you’ve finished a session: ideally, you need to be able to get straight down to work the minute you decide to write. If domestic distractions make working at home impossible, don’t give up. Find somewhere else: perhaps a library, a cafe – that worked for J. K. Rowling – or a friend’s house. The shed at the bottom of the garden shouldn’t be despised – garden sheds worked for both Roald Dahl and Philip Pullman. You don’t need to be comfortable as much as you need to be writing. If you can realistically allocate two hours a day to your writing, that’s fantastic. But you probably can’t: you may well be snatching odd hours or moments here and there. The problem with this is that almost everything else will be clamouring for your attention more noisily than your writing does, and the writing will repeatedly get pushed to the end of the queue. So you may find it helpful, or even necessary, to prioritise and regularise your writing time: allot specific hours and then be prepared to defend that time. Make it a date in your diary. If circumstances compel you to postpone, schedule a new date to make up for the one you’ve missed. Once you’re in your writing space, try to avoid delay. If your delaying tactics include such activities as the sharpening of pencils, the filling of fountain pens and the organising of notes, it’s worth bearing in mind that these largely mechanical tasks can usually be done in advance, in odd moments not dedicated to the central business of writing. And, while you might reasonably take a moment to settle to your task, it’s not advisable to spend long periods waiting for inspiration. Start writing – something, anything – and inspiration will often follow. As E. L. Doctorow has sensibly said: ‘Planning to write is not writing.... Writing is writing.’ Remember that the sequence of your plot needn’t determine the sequence of composition. If you’re stuck, overleap the sticking point and start writing a section which presents itself more clearly or more excitingly. You can return later to the problem area, by which time some of the new material you’ve written may have given you ideas for the passage you’ve temporarily set aside. Ernest Hemingway said that he had learned ‘never to empty the well’ – that is, he learned to stop a session of writing before the ideas ran out. ‘I always worked,’ he said, ‘until I had something done, and I always stopped when I knew what was going to happen next. That way I could be sure of going on the next day.’ It’s a strategy that presupposes that the writer has considerable choice as to when to stop, and it may not work for writers who are temperamentally inclined to strike while the iron is hot, or who worry that they may have forgotten their brilliant ideas by the following morning, but the implied advice is worth considering. Any piece of advice may be debatable, but the important question is: ‘Does this work for me?’ If it doesn’t, it can simply be ignored; if it does, we should make sure that we integrate it fully into our writing practice.

2/26/2022,"Manchester United are unbeaten in 10 games in all competitions, Watford have only one victory in all competitions since November. Yet the reverse fixture was Watford’s 4-1 win under Claudio Ranieri that resulted in Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s sacking and the hiring of Ralf Rangnick as interim manager. Watford now also have a new coach – Roy Hodgson – and in the fight against relegation, he would dearly love to complete his team’s home-and-away double over United.

2/26/2022,"Two teams meet in urgent need of maximum points but for entirely different reasons. With their 15-game unbeaten run in the Premier League halted last weekend and Liverpool reducing a 12-point gap to three, while establishing a superior goal difference in the process, Manchester City suddenly find themselves under pressure at the top. Another winning streak may be required to keep the challengers at bay. Frank Lampard has enjoyed two stirring home wins out of two so far but two anaemic away defeats, plus the improved form of Newcastle and Burnley, have kept Everton firmly in the relegation mire.
