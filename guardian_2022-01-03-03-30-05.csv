1/3/2022,"Russia is “very likely” to invade Ukraine and might only be deterred by “enormous sanctions”, the chair of the US House intelligence committee said on Sunday.  Adam Schiff also said an invasion could backfire on Moscow, by drawing more countries into the Nato military alliance. “I also think that a powerful deterrent is the understanding that if they do invade, it is going to bring Nato closer to Russia, not push it farther away,” he said. This week, Joe Biden told Vladimir Putin the US would impose serious sanctions if Russia attacked. Talks are scheduled. But amid tensions heightened by both sides’ possession of nuclear weapons, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said that if “the west continues its aggressive line, Russia will be forced to take all necessary measures to ensure strategic balance and eliminate unacceptable threats to our security”. Russia has for years complained about Nato encroachment. Ukraine is not a member of the alliance, which guarantees collective defence, but Nato has expanded eastwards since the fall of the Soviet Union and Kiev is urgently seeking admission. Russia invaded Ukrainian territory in 2014, annexing Crimea. The US has supplied “small” arms to Ukraine. On CBS’s Face the Nation, Schiff was asked what would stop Putin ordering an invasion by Russian troops gathered near the border. “I think that it would require enormous sanctions on Russia to deter what appears to be a very likely Russian invasion of Ukraine again,” Schiff said. “And I think our allies need to be solidly on board with it. Russia needs to understand we are united in this.” An invasion, Schiff said, would see “more Nato assets closer to Russia. [It] will have the opposite impact of what Putin is trying to achieve”. Schiff said he had “no problem” with “going after Putin personally”, but thought “sector-sized sanctions will be the most important”. Asked if he thought scheduled talks had any chance of averting an invasion, he said: “I fear that Putin is very likely to invade. I still frankly don’t understand the full motivation for why now he’s doing this, but he certainly appears intent on it unless we can persuade him otherwise. “And I think nothing other than a level of sanctions that Russia has never seen will deter him, and that’s exactly what we need to do with our allies.”",News/World news,Russia ‘very likely’ to invade Ukraine without ‘enormous sanctions’ – Schiff,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/russia-invade-ukraine-enormous-sanctions-schiff
1/3/2022,"Liz Truss, the current favourite to succeed Boris Johnson as leader of the Conservatives among party members, hosted a lunch at an expensive private club owned by a Tory donor after overruling civil service advice to look for a cheaper venue. Leaked correspondence has revealed the foreign secretary “refused to consider anywhere else” and asked that public funds should pay for a £3,000 event with Joe Biden’s trade representative.  Civil servants were so concerned at the cost and the venue’s close links to the Tories that the proposal was referred to the most senior official at the Department for International Trade. According to the correspondence, Truss, then the trade secretary, “explicitly asked that we book 5 Hertford Street”, which is owned by Robin Birley, a £20,000 donor to Boris Johnson’s leadership campaign and the half-brother of Zac Goldsmith, the environment minister. The venue agreed to reduce the bill to £1,400, but on condition of immediate payment – which meant civil servants had to use an emergency process to pay up straight away. The correspondence, disclosed by the Sunday Times, comes as Truss’s supporters conduct a campaign for her to succeed the prime minister should he be toppled by Tory MPs. Truss and her companions drank two bottles of dry gin, three £153 bottles of Pazo Barrantes Albariño, a Spanish white wine and two bottles of the French red Coudoulet de Beaucastel at £130 a bottle, it was reported. Before attending the event with US trade representatives, a civil servant described the club as “obviously incredibly expensive and more than I understand we’d usually expect to pay for such a venue”. “SoS (Truss) is hosting [the US trade rep] Katherine Tai tomorrow for dinner. She wishes to do so in a private dining room. “[Her special adviser] is insisting it takes place at a private members’ club called 5 Hertford Street. She’s recommended this based on having been there before – her argument is that it’s of the appropriate size and standing. “To my knowledge we haven’t hosted anyone there before as a department.” The email, sent on 15 June, said officials had suggested another option, Quo Vadis in Soho, which “costs only £1,000”. This was refused on behalf of Truss, because she was “insisting we book 5 Hertford Street” and Quo Vadis would be “inappropriate”. The email continued: “Something we’ve just discovered is the owner … is Robin Birley, a donor of the PM, Conservative party and Ukip. “I understand the venue hosts party events, which is presumably how SoS and [her special adviser] know it.” Civil servants subsequently entered negotiations with the venue regarding the price, leading to its events manager agreeing to waive hire fees and reduce the overall bill to £1,400 on the agreement it was paid immediately after the meeting. The condition left civil servants having to use an emergency process to sanction the payment. The permanent secretary, John Alty, said he was “content” with the agreement. The disclosure has led to calls for further disclosures over the event. The Department of Trade in November told the Mail on Sunday that the venue was chosen due to availability at short notice, not because Truss had insisted upon it. The lunch was condemned by Labour MPs. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “It is shameful to see Liz Truss pushing against official advice to book a luxury lunch that brings in thousands of pounds of business to a Tory donor. Without a US trade deal in sight, the sheer incompetence of wasting taxpayer money is truly jarring. Whilst working people see their household budgets squeezed, Conservative ministers always manage to find ways to line their mates’ pockets.” Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, wrote on Twitter that Truss has previously faced questions over her “expensive tastes”, and raised an example of the former international trade secretary’s decision to take three staff members to Vietnam and Singapore in December 2020. Truss was forced to correct a parliamentary question about the south-east Asia trip and disclose that the cost to the taxpayer included £20,296 on flights, £3,980 on accommodation and £4,034 – or £250 a day for each person – on expenses. Thornberry wrote that this “won’t be the last time Liz Truss gets in trouble asking the taxpayer to foot the bill for her expensive tastes”. “This is about character, and if Truss’s natural instinct is to hide the truth and hope no one asks questions when it comes to small things, don’t be surprised when she does it about big things.” Often considered to be London’s most exclusive club, 5 Hertford Street hosted Prince Harry’s first date with Meghan, but posted six-figure losses last year. Truss is reported to have previously used it to host “fizz with Liz” dinners with MPs and “biz for Liz” receptions with potential donors, in preparation for a likely leadership bid. A DIT spokesperson said: “This was a diplomatic working dinner attended by the previous international trade secretary, senior UK officials, and US counterparts from our largest single trading partner.”",News/Politics,"Liz Truss hosted £3,000 lunch for US envoy over civil service objections",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/02/liz-truss-hosted-3k-lunch-for-us-envoy-over-civil-service-objections
1/3/2022,"Ben Stokes has thrown his full support behind Joe Root and Chris Silverwood, insisting any blame for England’s Ashes defeat should be shared around the tour party. The all-rounder has also stated that he has no designs on the Test captaincy himself. Stokes is arguably the only viable candidate to replace Root should a change of leadership occur after a one-sided series which Australia lead 3-0 going into the fourth Test starting on Wednesday in Sydney. With a fifth Test in Hobart still to come – not a given as Covid-19 continues to loom over proceedings – others are simply playing for their spots.  But while Root has now overseen 59 Tests, the point where a jaded Alastair Cook ended his record stint in charge in early 2017, Stokes is not expecting a similar outcome yet. He also had words of encouragement for Silverwood that were doubtless welcome after it was confirmed the head coach has the virus and will not return until next week. “I don’t sense that at all with Joe,” Stokes said. “He’s brought this team a long way. He’s done some great things. Obviously this series hasn’t gone too well. Not from a captaincy point of view but from a team and results point of view. Unfortunately, the captain and coach bear the scrutiny for that but there are 10 other guys out there in the field beside the captain. “At the end of the day, the most important people’s opinions are those guys in the dressing room and [Root and Silverwood] have our thorough support. “Captaincy is more than about setting fields, picking the team, making decisions out in the middle. A captain is someone you play for. Joe Root is someone I always want to play for. Chris Silverwood is exactly the same. He’s a real players’ coach. He stands up for you as individuals and players as well.” Asked if he fancied stepping up should Root decide he has run his race, Stokes, the vice-captain, replied: “I’ve said I’ve never really had an ambition to be a captain. That’s totally Joe’s decision. He shouldn’t be forced into doing it. I’m sure Cooky felt the same way. He did it for so long. When he knew his time was up, his time was up. Those discussions haven’t even entered anywhere near Joe yet.” Root’s commitment was in evidence when England returned to training on Sunday and the captain found himself using the slinger to help his teammates bat in the nets. The coaching staff is now threadbare, Silverwood having tested positive while already isolating with his family in Melbourne, and following on from Jon Lewis (the seam bowling coach), Jeetan Patel (spin coach) and Darren Veness (fitness) last week. To sum things up, the former captain Adam Hollioake drove down from Queensland to Sydney over the weekend after being asked to help out by Graham Thorpe, the acting head coach, only to discover he was a close contact of a positive case and needed to immediately isolate. Soon after, the local net bowlers were forced out of England’s session midway through after one of them received a positive result. “You almost go back to club cricket where you have to do your own stuff,” Stokes said, regarding the farcical situation. “The next couple of days are about getting what you can out of the resources we have available. It’s not ideal but it’s also Sydney at new year, so you’ve got to look for the positives – in a non‑Covid sense.” Among these is simply a return to the international arena for Stokes, the 30-year-old having taken four months out in the summer to address a finger injury and his mental health. By his own admission his output so far – 101 runs with the bat at 16, four wickets with the ball at 62 – has been “pretty average”. To continue a theme of England’s recent press interactions, he too now wants to put “pride back into the badge”. There was also an acceptance that Australia have been outstanding with the ball, never more so than the second evening in Melbourne when Mitchell Starc reduced England to 31 for four in the final hour and Stokes found himself walking out in front of 49,000 baying home fans after Jack Leach’s appearance as nightwatchman lasted two balls. Stokes, who admitted to delaying his entrance in the hope of shaving off an over before stumps, said: “When I look back at that hour, with Pat Cummins and Mitch Starc bowling, even I was watching that going, ‘I don’t know what I would do to counteract that’. That was some of the highest quality bowling I think I’ve seen in a Test match. “I said to some of the guys the next morning, it’s the first time I’ve actually been taken aback by the atmosphere in a cricket ground. Although we were on the receiving end of that, it was pretty special to feel that at the MCG.” Though England’s resources are reduced, they appear unlikely to call on any players featuring in the Big Bash League. On Sunday those in the Twenty20 squad who will face West Indies this month – Sam Billings, Saqib Mahmood, Tymal Mills, James Vince, Reece Topley and George Garton – were told to return to the UK by 7 January. Reported initially as if it was a Dunkirk-style evacuation in response to the rising number of Covid cases in Australia, this was always their intended departure in order to begin “safe living guidelines and Covid-19 protocols” before the squad’s flight to Barbados.",Sport/Sport,Ben Stokes backs Joe Root and says he has ‘no ambition’ to be England captain,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/02/ben-stokes-backs-joe-root-and-says-he-has-no-ambition-to-be-england-captain
1/3/2022,"Simon Hattenstone and Daniel Lavelle call for Boris Johnson to support a policy of Housing First, an effort to provide people with housing and only later try to address any other needs, such as addiction (Johnson has a chance to end homelessness now – if he dares to seize it, 28 December). This policy is common sense, but there are good grounds to be sceptical of how it might be implemented. Prof Nicholas Pleace from the University of York has shown how support for Housing First from some corners of our political debate can reflect very different agendas. For example, the Centre for Social Justice – founded by Iain Duncan Smith – supports Housing First, but in ways very different from what Hattenstone and Lavelle have in mind. For this side of the political debate, Housing First can sit with denying the social causes of homelessness and the dysfunctional housing system.  Housing First is widely applauded and increasingly evidenced, but also contested. Johnson and his government could leap in support of what could be labelled Housing First, while still taking no systemic action on access to housing, funding for mental health services or the availability of drug and alcohol services. We should seek Johnson’s attention to Housing First, but also make sure that a chaperone keeps watch on what happens later.Andy GuiseSenior lecturer in social science and health, King’s College London  The article on homelesseness unearthed disturbing memories. In 1990, I went to the Royal Opera House and parked somewhere near Lincoln’s Inn Fields. Surrounded by lawyers’ offices and fine houses, the green square in the middle was a tented camp for homeless people. When Tony Blair came into office in 1997, homelessness did significantly decrease through the rough sleepers unit. On a rainy evening in 2017, I came out of a theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue. The homeless people were back. Doorways, damp sleeping bags and cardboard again sufficed for shelter. There may be many reasons why people are homeless, but the actions of governments over the last three decades have been the main reason: no building to replace sold council houses; the bedroom tax; the introduction of punitive universal credit; the two-children-only benefit; lack of secure work; rent rises; austerity to make up for lax banking controls. “Everyone in” may be part of the answer, but it is pitiful against the real causes created by successive governments: poverty and lack of affordable decent houses to rent.Karen WynyardWhitstable, Kent  The searing article on the growth in homelessness under Boris Johnson makes comparisons with humane and effective policies on homelessness in the US and Finland. But within the UK, Scotland has effective policies – as set out in its government’s 2021 Ending Homelessness Together report. Under these policies, Scottish night shelters are kept closed by providing better-quality emergency accommodation; 100,000 genuinely affordable homes were brought on stream. The temporary ban on the enforcement of eviction orders was extended, to provide renters with safe homes during the pandemic. Hardship schemes were introduced to support those struggling to pay their rent and people with no recourse to public funds were helped to avoid destitution. Most importantly, legislation was amended so that no homeless household has to stay in unsuitable accommodation for more than seven days.Kate MacintoshWinchester  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/3/2022,"A Tory peer has vowed to lead a boycott of Coca-Cola products over the company’s sponsorship of the 2022 Beijing Olympics, saying its bid to profit from an event organised by the Chinese government was shameless. Robert Hayward, who was a founding chairman of the world’s first gay rugby club and a former personnel manager for Coca-Cola Bottlers, said it was unacceptable for firms to help to boost the used of the Winter Games as a propaganda exercise given concerns over the treatment of 1 million Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang province.  Groups such as Human Rights Watch have accused Xi Jinping’s administration of crimes against humanity, growing repression in Hong Kong, tightened control over the media and mass surveillance. The UK parliament passed a motion in April 2021 that said genocide was taking place in north-west China, but Beijing has denied any atrocities and accused western politicians of “lies and disinformation”. Concern grew more recently when the Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai disappeared from public life for almost three months after accusing a senior member of the Communist party of sexual assault. Hayward said he would not buy any Coca-Cola products, which include brands such as Innocent, Schweppes and Fanta, and that he hoped large numbers of people would do the same. “If they are going to take that approach, then they have to understand that there are lots of people in this world, many of whom are probably Muslims in many countries but others who are of different faiths, who just think it’s unacceptable that they should participate,” he said. People should use their personal judgment about whether to buy a product or service, but “there comes a point … where you wish to say ‘no, this is just unacceptable’,” he said. “It is a propaganda event and I am not going to go along with it when so many people are currently suffering and losing their liberty.” Hayward said he was taking the stand specifically against Coca-Cola because it was “dependent on a good image with the public” to sell its goods, though he also voiced concern about Proctor & Gamble, another headline sponsor. He said it was unacceptable for firms to “be trying to gain kudos out of a worldwide sporting event hosted by the Chinese government” given it “has been shown in the last few months to be persecuting the Uyghurs to an extreme extent”. “I’m hoping that it sends a message to all major public companies that there is a benefit and a dis-benefit to associating themselves with major sporting events,” he said, adding he would raise the issue in the House of Lords soon. Drawing on his experience as a former chief executive of the British Soft Drinks Association, Hayward said Coca-Cola should have had a “force majeure” clause in its sponsorship contract with the Olympic organisers that it could activate if necessary, allowing it to pull out over China’s actions. By refusing to buy the products over the next few months, individuals could send a message in a way that would be much better than “the kneejerk reaction of saying the sportsmen and women should boycott the Olympics”, he said. A spokesperson for the International Olympic Committee said sponsors “provide valuable financial resources that support the development of sport at all levels around the world”, helping it to redistribute the equivalent of about $3.4m (£2.5m) a day to athletes and sports organisations at all levels. They said sponsors played no role in the selection of the host country for each Games. Coca-Cola did not respond to a request for comment, but the company said on its website it is “the longest-running, continuous sponsor” of both the summer and winter Olympics. “We believe the Olympic movement is a force for good, bringing people and countries together, and we’re proud to use our name to raise its profile and support the world’s most watched and revered international sporting event,” it said.",Sport/Sport,Tory peer to lead boycott of Coca-Cola over role in Beijing Winter Olympics,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/02/tory-to-lead-boycott-of-coca-cola-over-role-in-beijing-winter-olympics
1/3/2022,"One of the architects of the Northern Ireland peace deal has said Boris Johnson and the former Brexit minister Lord Frost have risked “all the work” the previous generation of politicians put into the Belfast Good Friday agreement by putting their hard ideological beliefs ahead of people. Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair’s former chief of staff and chief negotiator on Northern Ireland, said he was concerned that neither the prime minister nor the recently resigned Brexit minister seemed to understand or care about the fragility of the political settlement in Northern Ireland in 1998.  He also questioned why Frost had made the issue of the European court of justice a red line in negotiations on the Northern Ireland protocol when it was not responsible for either the practical difficulties in trade or the identity politics that has been heightened by the row over the Irish Sea border. He said it was irresponsible to stoke the fears of one side or another or to fail to calm nerves about British identity after rioting on the streets earlier in 2020. “What worries me is the casual political vandalism. They really don’t seem to care. I mean the damage they are doing to the very fragile political settlements in Northern Ireland, by posturing on things like the European court of justice, which do not matter to voters in Northern Ireland,” he said. “They may matter to Boris Johnson and some supporters [in the government] and the ideological base. But is it really worth sacrificing all the work that previous generations of politicians put into the Northern Ireland peace process on the ideological altar of the ECJ?” he asked. Lord Frost had repeatedly threatened to suspend parts of the protocol arrangements using its article 16 before he resigned as Brexit minister citing differences over tax policy and Covid restrictions. While the appointment of the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, to succeed Frost was initially read as a reset moment, publicly she is presenting herself as the continuity negotiator. “The UK position has not changed. We need goods to flow freely between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, end the role of the ECJ as the final arbiter of disputes between us, and resolve other issues,” she said before Christmas. Powell warned the institutions of devolved government could collapse unless the British government focused on the practical problems created by the post-Brexit customs and physical checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. While he doesn’t expect a return to the troubles of the past, he said Brexit created an ongoing issue in Northern Ireland. “You have to face up to the fact that Brexit requires someone to get hurt. “There is nothing you can do about the political issue of identity given the history of two communities in Northern Ireland. But there is going to be a border because of Brexit and it has to be somewhere. No one’s come up with a better idea than in the Irish Sea. If it is there, it affects unionist identity and what you have to do is ameliorate the impact of it,” he said. His comments came after not just the transfer of power from Frost to Truss but a changing political landscape south of the Irish border. “Brexit has put talk of a united Ireland firmly on the agenda south of the border and the government needs to pay attention to this and to understand how that is also fuelling unionist fears about the future of Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom,” he said. “Identity politics is going to keep coming back. Imagine if you have a border poll on a united Ireland and 48% for remaining in the United Kingdom, a bit like the Brexit referendum. “People don’t want to address that problem. I understand. But it’s the fear of that that’s causing the trouble.” In an interview published on Sunday, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, said Truss should set a deadline for the talks with the EU over the protocol. He would not say how much longer should be allowed, but he told the Sunday Telegraph: “January is going to be an absolutely crucial month.” And if the deadline passed without a deal acceptable to the UK, the government should trigger article 16, he said. “If we don’t get rapid and decisive progress, and one side or the other is kicking the can down the road, this will have major implications for the stability of the political institutions in Northern Ireland,” he said.",News/UK news,NI peace architect accuses Boris Johnson of ‘casual political vandalism’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/02/ni-peace-architect-accuses-boris-johnson-of-casual-political-vandalism
1/3/2022,"My friend Andy Newman, who has died aged 56, was a community leader who built an award-winning public garden on disused land. From those green shoots he and his partner, Karen Clark, galvanised local people in the network of north London roads known as Harringay Gardens to fight back against pollution, traffic and urban blight, bringing greenery and cooperation to our neighbourhood. In 1996, when Andy and Karen moved to the area, there was on their doorstep a derelict patch of land leading to a railway arch. Once an entrance to the now-demolished Harringay stadium on the other side of the tracks, the land had become a dumping ground for old cars and other rubbish, and a crime hotspot.Andy later recalled meeting an elderly neighbour who had “peered out of her bedroom window as a young girl and watched cows being herded under the railway arch to graze at the local watercress farm ... We had just started a young family and this image gave us the determination to bring the land back into natural use.”That is exactly what Andy and Karen, both keen gardeners, did, with trademark tenacity and wiliness, plus a package of government funding channelled into the wider area, which at the time had seen a startling increase in gang violence.Vital to the garden’s success was the simultaneous formation of a community group, the Gardens Residents Association, which began transforming the streets through the planting of trees, initiatives to curtail fly-tipping and crime, and the reduction of heavy traffic which had long blighted the area. Six roads became what would these days be termed a low traffic neighbourhood, provoking, then as now, polarising and powerful opinions. The effect was instant – without thousands of cars a day cutting through, a shortcut became a community again, almost overnight.In 2002, thanks to Andy, it got a community centre to call its own – albeit one without a roof. The community garden remains a moment of beauty and respite in a dense urban environment, stocked with fabulous plants now in their prime – including several of Andy’s much-favoured giant echium.The garden, which raises all its own funds, hosts outdoor film screenings, Halloween events, egg hunts and Christmas gatherings. It has spawned a successful “play streets” initiative, and many other family- and nature-focused events. It has stretched out its roots into the local streets for two decades; trees, bulbs and shrubs flourish where once there were none.  The garden is open to everyone and will celebrate its 20th anniversary in September. The association has been no less successful, winning more than 40 local and national awards. Both residents’ association and garden were turbo-charged by Andy’s knowledge, hard work and resilience. His legacy is all around his friends and neighbours, and will not be forgotten.Andy was born in Exeter, Devon, the youngest of three sons of Irene (nee Pye), a care assistant, and Lewis, a shoemaker. After leaving Clyst Vale community college, he studied interior design at South Devon College of Arts and Technology, and 3D design at Suffolk College of Higher and Further Education. He was a freelance artist and designer for most of his working life until joining Southwark council in 2013.  He is survived by Karen and their children, Amber and Jasper, and by his brother Peter. Another brother, David, predeceased him.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Andy Newman obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/02/andy-newman-obituary
