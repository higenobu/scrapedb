5/20/2022,"A Japanese man reportedly gambled away millions of Japanese yen’s worth of COVID relief funds that he received by mistake. Last month, the Japanese government inadvertently sent a COVID relief fund meant for 463 people worth 46.3 million yen ($360,890) to a 24-year-old man. After receiving the amount, the man initially said he would cooperate with local authorities but eventually went into hiding. His sudden disappearance prompted the southern town of Abu in Japan's Yamaguchi Prefecture to file a civil lawsuit while also considering criminal action. While he remains in hiding, his lawyer spoke to the press on Tuesday, saying the man had been cooperating with officials and is willing to be questioned by prefecture authorities.
