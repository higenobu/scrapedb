3/6/2022,"Oh, Warnie. What have you got up to now? Death is always shocking; the most shocking of all the everyday things. A day on from the death of Shane Warne, aged 52, there is still a sense of genuine disbelief, a shared bruising that seems to transcend the usual response to the loss of a much-loved sports star. This is still hard to grasp. It feels like an escapade, a twist, another moment in the fond, picaresque story that is the life of Shane. Mainly, though, it just feels a little worse with every passing hour, a death that makes less sense, and seems more startling as it begins to sink in. No doubt the scale of Warne’s presence has something to do with this. He became public property at a very young age and remained so to the end. Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, has already suggested a state funeral, and while politicians are always motivated, at bottom, by being politicians, this seems about right. Warne was a great Australian as much as a great Australian cricketer, and a startlingly vivid entity. If you love or like or even simply know about cricket his death is like losing a piece of infrastructure, a day of the week, an element of your internal world. But still, it’s not just that. Perhaps that sense of shock is down to the unusually vivid brilliance of his deeds as a cricketer. Warne was a true sporting genius, in a way that gives that term interest and meaning. Like Lionel Messi or Usain Bolt, Warne was one of those few individuals who can take these fixed disciplines, with their set choreography, their limits and absolutes, and turn that closed world into an activity that feels like an extension of their own character and capacities, an expression of something noble and transcendent. But, no, it’s not just that either. Mainly, this is to do with character, the irresistible and contagious Shane-ness of Shane. One of the joys of having seen his entire career unfold in real time is that it sits there complete and unimprovable, from the rosy-cheeked stripling to the gloriously grizzled and statesmanlike Yoda-Warne of 2005, with his lovable little flared white trousers, his ennobling air of gravitas. But that connection is still there even if you never saw him in the flesh, or came to it late, or backfilled the whole thing from YouTube videos and the overspill affections of others. One of the things about getting older is that your friends start to die. And this is the thing about Warne. However you knew him, from afar or close up, he felt like a friend. This was also earned. Warne was in the first instance a truly great sports person – and great in a way that cannot and will not be repeated, if only because the world he inhabited and might even have saved, Test cricket as the unapologetic apex, has now effectively gone. This was always the delicious paradox of Warne. Early on there was an attempt in the English press box in particular to portray him as a kind of beach-kid type, a junk-food cricketer, all brittle and volatile natural talent. One of the founding myths of early Warne is the origins story about suffering two broken legs aged eight and spending a year paddling himself around on a trolley, thereby developing a preternatural hand strength, source of his hard-spinning superpowers. Does this really sound credible? How would it work exactly? Are we scouting power lifters now? It is one way of explaining Warne away, of freak-ifying him. But in reality the essence of Warne’s brilliance was its orthodoxy, its old school purity. Warne was incredibly good at something incredibly hard, a bowling art so complex it had effectively died. Warne, the anti-hero, the custard-haired Ramone, was in fact a classicist. Warne, the cart-propelling surf dude, found crawling out of some urban dustbin clutching a packet of Cheetos and a cricket ball, was above all a brilliantly forensic thinker. Richie Benaud got it from the start, of course. “I might feel a touch of apprehension. But in the main I just feel a touch of delight,” Richie had said of Warne’s selection for Australia after just four first class games for Victoria. Warne ended up part of a three-man attack at Sydney after Bruce Reid broke down. His hands were sweating so hard he couldn’t grip the ball. Sachin Tendulkar and Ravi Shastri “went on the rampage”, and Warne was just glad to pick up a skyer at the end, convinced he was done. Except, of course, that didn’t happen. Everyone has their favourite Warne, from the mid-90s wonder years when he bowled every ball, when the shoulder was loose, through to the that wily, round-armed IPL incarnation, by which stage the bowling action was reminiscent of a man hailing a late-night taxi while also trying very hard not to spill his kebab. Perhaps the most epic Warne was the 1999 World Cup version, dropped and injured and scandal-ridden, when he seemed to have reached that point when an athlete is defending rather than building their legacy; but still came back to produce something stunning and effectively reboot himself. First, Warne actually called the “you’ve just dropped the World Cup” moment in the final group game against South Africa. Before the match Warne had told his teammates not to walk off until Herschelle Gibbs had fully caught the ball. Warne had noticed he tended to throw it up too early as he caught it. Gibbs duly dropped Steve Waugh doing this. It seems absurd. But that was Warne’s uncanny gift, the acuity of his eye. Then he produced a stunning spell to turn the semi-final, going absolutely wild on the pitch, leaping and bellowing, proclaiming his own renaissance. And yes, there was some scandal down the years. Does anyone really care? He was covertly filmed mucking about in a pair of Playboy underpants carrying, among other things, an inflatable cricket stump, although frankly, you’d want to ask some questions here about the people doing the filming. He upset a few people by wearing the wrong duds, by failing to buy into the fetishising of the baggy green. He took some casino chips from an Indian bookmaker for talking about the pitch and conditions and that was pretty weak, Warnie, ffs. But here is a rare thing. Cricket is a bitchy, unforgiving world. But nobody out there has a genuine bad word to say about Warne, from teammates to opponents to people who met him along the way. Quite the opposite. Instead the abiding memory is of his natural generosity. Warne ennobled other players with his skill (how much goodwill has Mike Gatting reeled in on the back of his straight man role in the ball of the century?). He played a huge role in the unforgettable theatre of the 2005 Ashes series, and in the blossoming of other talents, from Kevin Pietersen to an endless stream of leg-spin bowlers around the world. His talent and personalty did preserve Test cricket: he gave us an extra 30 years of this stuff. Perhaps the best way to remember him is his final comeback in the Big Bash aged 42, when he produced the unimprovable feat of predicting his own wicket on mic’d-up commentary, bowling Brendan McCullum around his legs while being cheered on from the stands by his kids and his girlfriend Liz Hurley (who, read the books, he really was very close to), and doing so in front of a wildly cheering full house: the perfect end to the perfect career, a moment of pure Warne Supremacy. He still had so much to give. He could have been a great elder statesman. He could have done wonderful things for English cricket. If they’d ever trusted him. Mainly, though, what will be missed is that vividness, the sense of that much-loved friend you may have never actually met; but who feels right now like a profound absence.",Sport/Sport,Shane Warne’s death is like that of a friend and gets worse with each hour | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/05/shane-warnes-death-is-like-that-of-a-friend-and-gets-worse-with-each-hour
3/6/2022,"Vladimir Putin delivered a chilling warning to the west over the imposition of sanctions on Russia on Saturday, warning that measures designed to cripple his country’s economy were “akin to an act of war”. In comments that were both defiant and threatening, the Russian president also told Ukraine’s leaders that their nation risked being dismantled as an independent sovereign state if they continued to resist Russia’s invasion. “The current leadership needs to understand that if they continue doing what they are doing, they risk the future of Ukrainian statehood,” Putin said. “If that happens they will have to be blamed for that.” His intervention, in which he hinted the conflict could soon spread beyond Ukraine unless the west changed course, came as Moscow broke a ceasefire agreement to allow Ukrainian civilians to flee after 10 days of bombing and devastation. Later, Russia’s foreign ministry followed up Putin’s warning by specifically singling out the UK for what it called “sanctions hysteria” and its prominent role in supporting Ukraine. Maria Zakharova, the foreign ministry spokeswoman, said Russia would not forget the UK’s cooperation with Kyiv. “The sanctions hysteria in which London plays one of the leading, if not the main, roles, leaves us no choice but to take proportionately tough retaliatory measures,” she said, adding that Britain’s Russian interests would be “undermined” by Moscow’s response. As tensions rose to new levels, and early hopes that diplomatic progress might be made in behind-the-scenes negotiations were dashed, the UK Foreign Office advised all Britons in Russia to leave without delay by any available commercial routes. The number of UK citizens in the country is estimated at upwards of 6,000. Increasingly, European diplomats believe Putin sees the west’s supply of weaponry and other support to Ukraine as direct intervention of a kind that requires retaliation. Referring to Ukraine’s demand for Nato to impose a no-fly zone over the country – which Nato has rejected – Putin added: “The realisation of that demand would bring catastrophic results not only to Europe but to the whole world.” On the ground, Ukraine claimed on Saturday to have destroyed more of Russia’s firepower. The armed forces said soldiers had shot down a helicopter and two warplanes, capturing three pilots. One of them had taken part in Russian bombing missions in Syria, it alleged. Ukrainian troops launched a successful counter-attack in the Kharkiv region, seizing equipment and armoured vehicles. The city, Ukraine’s second biggest, has been under ferocious Russian bombardment. On Saturday, in the south of the country residents flooded the main square in the city of Kherson and protested peacefully against the occupation. They waved Ukrainian flags and even hijacked a Russian armoured personnel carrier, taking it for a spin, to loud applause. Similar large-scale anti-Russian demonstrations took place in Melitopol, where Russian soldiers fired into the air, and the Azov Sea port of Berdyansk. As the ceasefire agreements broke down, both sides blamed each other. The Kremlin blamed Ukraine for the collapse of a deal to evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and the nearby town of Volnovakha, while Ukrainian officials said attempts to create a humanitarian corridor in the east for 200,000 trapped civilians failed because of shelling. Despite the growing international alarm and the escalation of rhetoric, diplomatic efforts were underway this weekend to broker a way out of the crisis. It is understood President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey, which has so far refused to impose sanctions on Moscow, is hoping to speak to Putin on Sunday to discuss a ceasefire. Diplomats believe Erdoğan is eyeing a potential role as interlocutor. Meanwhile EU leaders will meet in Versailles in Paris on Thursday to try to come to a common position on Ukraine’s request for candidate status. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is believed to see putting his country on a “fast track” to joining the EU as crucial to securing its political future, even if Kyiv needs to offer Putin a guarantee of military neutrality in any talks on ending the war. In Washington, there has been talk of offering Putin a so-called “golden bridge” – blocking all his avenues of advance while making retreat as attractive as possible. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Friday the door to negotiation was open. “If they show any signs of being willing to engage in meaningful diplomacy, of course we’ll engage,” he said. But western diplomats do not believe Putin is in the mood to backdown or negotiate. Former UK foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind said, however, that Putin must have been stung by the huge effects of the sanctions, particularly the blocking of 60% of Russia’s $600bn of foreign reserves. US officials hope the economic pain inflicted on Russia will force Putin to climb down. But some critics of the Biden administration’s response argue the “golden bridge” has not been signposted clearly enough. “If the goal is to compel, then the sanctioners need to be explicit about what Russia can do to get the sanctions lifted,” Dan Drezner, a political scientist and sanctions expert at Tufts University, wrote in the Washington Post. “That lack of clarity undermines coercive bargaining, because the targeted actor believes sanctions will stay in place no matter what they do.”",News/World news,Defiant Putin warns the west: your sanctions are akin to an act of war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/defiant-putin-warns-the-west-your-sanctions-are-akin-to-an-act-of-war
3/6/2022,"The government has been urged to restrict the UK operation of Russia’s biggest technology company amid concern over its ties to the Kremlin. Yandex, Russia’s equivalent to Google, is headquartered in Moscow but operates in more than 17 countries and recently launched Yango Deli in London, a service offering 15-minute delivery to households of food, alcohol and toiletries. The parent company, which offers map, search, taxi and shopping services, has been subject to sanctions in Ukraine since 2017 following the 2014 annexation of Crimea. Last Monday, the Lithuanian government requested that the Yandex taxi app be pulled from the Google and Apple stores, saying it “threatens national security”, Reuters reported. Uber also announced last week that it was seeking to “accelerate” the sale of its stake in a joint venture with Yandex, which is legally headquartered in the Netherlands but has its main offices in Russia. But the tech giant, founded by Arkady Volozh, one of Russia’s wealthiest businessmen, has not been subject to sanctions or scrutiny in the UK – and Yango Deli, which was launched in London in October, continues to operate as usual. The grocery app, one of several ultra-fast delivery services to have arrived in the capital in recent months, sells 2,500 items, including fresh fruit and vegetables, Hovis bread and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, as well as running seasonal promotions, such as a 15-minute tree delivery at Christmas and red roses for Valentine’s Day. It has ambitions to expand: it is currently running ads on the Apple store and ultimately wants to achieve “nationwide coverage”, the company’s UK manager, Evgeny Chernikov, said in December. On 21 February, a few days before Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Yango Deli announced on Instagram that it was expanding into three new areas of London. MPs and analysts have expressed concern over the company’s presence and urged Downing Street to restrict Yandex’s UK operations. Its value has plunged since the invasion but it had an estimated market capitalisation last year of $27bn (£20bn). Several Russian companies, including Aeroflot, the national airline; Rostec, Russia’s largest defence company; and the gas giant Gazprom have faced sanctions in the UK so far, but technology companies such as Yandex have received little attention. Layla Moran, foreign affairs spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, likened the company to China’s Huawei, which was banned from Britain’s 5G network amid national security concerns, and said that its UK operation needed to be looked at urgently. “The government currently says that any company that is in any way propping up the Putin regime is potentially on the sanctions list,” she told the Observer. “If that’s the case, this company potentially squarely falls into that.” “The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office needs to be looking at this company as part of its suite of sanctions,” she added. Yandex is seen as having strong links to the Kremlin despite its US listing and formal Netherlands registration. In 2019, it agreed to a corporate restructuring that granted a veto over key decisions – such as those covering the security of personal data and intellectual property – to a government-linked body whose goal was to “defend the country’s interests”, the Guardian reported. The technology company has also been accused of stifling the flow of information about the war in Ukraine to people living in Russia. According to Russian law, results from the Yandex News search engine can include only publications officially listed on the national media watchdog’s register, restricting news from the outside world. Last week, Lev Gershenzon, Yandex’s former head of news, accused the company of being a “key element in hiding information” from Russians about the war, and urged people working there to quit. Security experts have also raised concerns about the company’s collection of vast amounts of personal data, including customers’ names, geolocation, address, phone number and browsing history, according to the privacy policy that users agree to when they sign up. Yango Deli customers in the UK are told that by using the service, they provide their “express and unambiguous consent” for the information to be transferred to Russia, where data protection is weaker. Analysts said there was the potential for data to be weaponised by Putin in future, including for coordinated disinformation campaigns or targeting people on UK soil. In 2020, it was reported that Yandex had pulled employees out of its office in Minsk, Belarus – a key ally of Russia – after the Belarusian security services raided its premises amid ongoing unrest in the country. Sources told Russian news outlet the Bell that the raid was an attempt to obtain data about passenger trips taken with Yandex Taxi, the Moscow Times reported. Sergey Sanovich, at the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University in the US, said Yandex was “innovative” and full of “talented people” who were “staunchly anti-war”, but that it, like all companies in Russia, was ultimately at Putin’s mercy. “The problem that Yandex has is that the Russian security service can demand access to any server located in Russia,” he said. Keir Giles, a senior Russia fellow at the international thinktank Chatham House, urged the government to assess the potential threat from Russian tech companies in the UK, saying: “People are not aware of how much data they are spreading around whenever they use an app.” The problem arises when it is a hostile state that wishes to cause us damage and is interested in specific individuals they wish to track in this country,” he said. “It has the potential to be weaponised against anybody. Do we want, at a time when Russia is considering the UK as an enemy, to be providing all our personal details to a server in Moscow?” Yandex declined to comment on the calls for sanctions but said Yango Deli UK remained “dedicated to providing high quality ultra-fast grocery delivery to Londoners”. In a statement, the company said UK customers’ information was processed in line with relevant regulations and EU-approved standards and that “the privacy of users’ data” was the “utmost priority”, adding: “Any data can only be sought from Yango Deli UK via a formal request to UK-based Yango Deli Limited, and only by following established international practices and channels.” “We are wishing and praying for peace to be restored as soon as possible,” a spokesperson added. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: “We will not speculate on future designations.”",News/World news,Warnings raised over Russian tech giant Yandex’s UK operation ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/warnings-raised-over-russian-tech-giant-yandexs-uk-operation
3/6/2022,"Below is a list of countries where allegations of sexual abuse have been reported in the past few years. Not all of the accusations have been tested through investigations. Allegations: Afghanistan football federation president Keramuudin Karim was accused of physically and sexually abusing several young female players from the national team. Status: Banned for life from all football-related activity and fined one million Swiss francs by Fifa in June 2019. Allegations: In May 2021, a number of high-profile female footballers in Argentina claimed they had been bullied and sexual harassed by a youth-team coach working for the country’s Football Association to Fifa. Status: The result of a Fifa investigation is pending. Allegations: The former Matildas captain Lisa De Vanna said in early October 2021 that she had been the victim of sexual assault, harassment and bullying throughout her career with Rhali Dobson, another former W-League player, also stating that she had suffered abuse. Status: On 22 October Sport Integrity Australia and Football Australia launched “an independent complaints and reports handling, investigation, and disciplinary framework”. They received submissions until the end of January, 2022, but have not yet published the findings. Allegations: Former technical director Ahmed Mohamed was accused of misconduct towards a senior female player in February 2021. A group of 27 senior players wrote to the BFA’s president demanding he was removed. Mohamed did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. Status: Mohamed left his post for “family reasons” and is now director of football in St Kitts. Fifa has said it will request more details about the appointment, while the Concacaf confederation has expressed its “extreme surprise and concern” that the St Kitts and Nevis Football Association claimed it consulted Concacaf over his appointment. Allegations: Multiple allegations of sexual assault and harrassment were made in October 2019 against the former Vancouver Whitecaps and Canada Women Under-20 coach Bob Birarda and he was arrested in 2020, charged with six counts of sexual exploitation, two counts of sexual assault, and one count of child luring over a 20-year period between 1988 and 2008. Status: Last month, Birarda pleaded guilty to four charges of sexual offence, including three counts of sexual assault and one count of sexual touching while in a position of authority. He will be sentenced later this year. Allegations: In June 2020, Carolina Rosa – the former physio for the Colombia Under-17 women’s team – claimed she was sexually abused at the hands of the coach Didier Luna. Status: Luna agreed a plea deal with the prosecutor’s office in June 2020 that meant he avoided prison by agreeing to a reduced charge of ‘injuria’, essentially an admission of occasional, one-off harassment. Allegations: Accusations of past sexual abuse by the coach Youssouf Ahamada Bachirou, from several players, including from the former Comoros international Khaled Simba, who spoke to Norwegian magazine Josimar and posted a video of his alleged experienced in January 2022. Bachirou has denied the allegations. Status: The alleged offences were reported to local police, who opened an investigation in January. Allegations: In 2019 Luis Pescarolo, the coach of Ecuador’s senior women’s team, was accused of sending a player “provocative messages”, including a request to engage in sexual activity. Pescarolo said the accusations “were false” and “insults towards the coaching staff”. Status: Pescarolo was sacked in April 2019. Allegations: Patrick Assoumou Eyi – known as “Capello” – has been accused of abusing boys in his previous role as the head coach of Gabon’s under-17 team. Serge Mombo, a leading football official in the country, has also been accused of sexually abusing young players and demanding sex as a condition of them securing places in national teams. Both deny the allegations. Status: Eyi and two other coaches facing charges including attempted rape on minors and endangering the life of another. Serge Mombo was arrested over the allegations on his return from the Africa Cup of Nations in January 2022. Allegations: In 2020, there were accusations of systematic abuse of minors at the National Football centre by the president, Yves Jean-Bart, and other officials including head of referees, Rosnick Grant. Status: Jean-Bart (2020) and Grant (2021) were banned from all football-related activities for life by Fifa. Allegations: In August 2021, the international footballer Tabitha Chawinga called on Malawi’s football authorities to introduce safeguards to protect women from abuse at all levels of the game. She claimed she had been forced to strip in public in 2009 and in 2010 to prove she was female and was regularly trolled on social media about her looks. Status: One of her clubs, DD Sunshine, said they lodged a complaint at the time with the Football Association of Malawi but did not get a response. Alfred Gunda, general secretary of the Football Association of Malawi who was not at the organisation when the complaint was made by Chawinga’s club, said in August 2021: “What happened is not right and we cannot condone it and that’s why we encourage that officials … that any incidents that happen are reported and the right measures are taken so that we protect our girls.” Allegations: The youth coach Uchralsaikhan Buuveibaatar was accused of sexually harassing and physically assaulting young players from girls’ Under-15 team during the East Asian Football Festival in South Korea in 2019. He denies committing “sexual crimes”. Status: Buuveibaatar was first suspended from all football-related activities in August 2019 by the Mongolian Football Federation’s disciplinary body, which reported the matter three months later to the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). The AFC told the Guardian that Buuveibaatar’s “sanction was extended worldwide by Fifa in August 2021” but football’s world governing body failed to announce it publicly. Allegations: In 2021, a youth coach was accused of forcing his underage players to have sex with women he exploited. Separately, the former Vitesse Arnhem youth player Renald Majoor said he was sexually abused by a coach at the club when he was a youth player at the club (1996). Status: The youth coach forcing his players into having sex with the women he exploited was sentenced to three years in prison in December 2021 for human trafficking, possessing and making child pornography, and exploiting young, vulnerable women. The coach at Vitesse, who died in 2011, was suspended by the club, according to Dutch newspaper Volskrant. Allegations: In October 2021 the head coach of Sierra Leone’s women’s football team Abdulai Bah was suspended with immediate effect over allegations of “professional misconduct”. The decision came a few days after the SLFA said it would investigate allegations of sexual harassment and intimidation of players in its women’s national teams. Bah has dismissed the allegations against him as “completely untrue and unfounded”. Status: Bah has stepped aside pending investigations. The SLFA opened an investigation but there have been no recent updates. Allegations: Former players from Crewe and Manchester City accused former coach Barry Bennell of multiple counts of sexual abuse. Several more youth players from the 1970s and 1980s came forward to allege similar abuse at other clubs. Status: In 2021, the Football Association, Premier League and leading clubs issued formal apologies after a landmark inquiry said that generations of young footballers suffered horrific sexual abuse because of the wholesale absence of child protection policies, ignorance and naivety. Bennell is serving a 34-year jail term after being convicted on five separate occasions of child sexual abuse offences against 22 boys. Allegations: In 2021, the North Carolina Courage coach Paul Riley was accused of alleged sexual harassment of the players Sinead Farrelly and Meleana Shim. Riley has denied the allegations. Status: Riley was sacked by the club and Fifa and US Soccer opened investigations. Allegations: Twenty-four Venezuela internationals signed a letter in October 2021 accusing their former coach Kenneth Zseremeta of psychological and sexual abuse, and harassment over sexual orientation. He has denied the accusations. Status: The Venezuelan football federation said it has asked Fifa, Conmebol and Concacaf to investigate and the country’s public prosecutor has opened an investigation. Allegations: Two female referees accused Zifa’s referees committee secretary general, Obert Zhoya and its chairman, Bryton Malandule of sexual harassment in September 2020. Malandule told the Guardian: “I am sure that you appreciate that when issues are before judicial bodies, one cannot comment as per the sub judice rule.” while Zhoya did not respond to the Guardian’s request to comment. Status: The allegations are being investigated by the police in Zimbabwe. Both men remain in their positions while neither referee has officiated since making the allegations.",Sport/Football,From Afghanistan to Zimbabwe: sexual abuse allegations in football around the world,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/05/from-afghanistan-to-zimbabwe-sexual-abuse-allegations-in-football-around-the-world
3/6/2022,"Many years afterwards, Pep Guardiola would joke that the reason he never took over at Manchester United was because he couldn’t understand Alex Ferguson’s accent. The pair went for dinner in New York in September 2012, when Guardiola was on sabbatical and pondering his next move. Over a luxurious meal and fine wine – all paid for by Ferguson – they talked falteringly about football and life and the future. “My English is not so good,” Guardiola later said, “and when Sir Alex spoke quickly I sometimes had a problem to understand him. That’s why maybe I didn’t understand if I received an offer or not.” It got a good laugh in the room at the time, but the truth was a little simpler and a little more complex. Ferguson had indeed identified Guardiola – whose Barcelona had demolished United in two of the previous four Champions League finals – as the leading candidate to succeed him after his retirement and was keen to gauge his interest. But the plain reason no offer was made was because there was still no job to offer. Ferguson was yet to come to a decision or firm timescale on his own future. “I asked Pep to phone me before he accepted an offer from another club,” Ferguson wrote in his autobiography. “But he didn’t.” As the months ticked by, United remained confident of securing Guardiola, but without much idea of how they were going to do it. The club’s chief executive at the time, David Gill – who was planning his own exit – and the owning Glazer family had essentially delegated responsibility for Ferguson’s replacement to Ferguson and were loth to force the issue. They did not know if Ferguson was going to quit, when he was going to quit, who his successor might be or how close they were to getting him. It feels almost incredible now that perhaps the most important decision in the club’s modern history was essentially taken in the dark. Guardiola, for his part, had long since made up his mind. While Ferguson intended on making an appointment towards the end of the season, Guardiola wanted clarity much sooner. Bayern Munich had been in contact since the previous summer and had spent months diligently selling the project to him in exhaustive detail. Ferguson finally told the club of his intentions in the spring, by which point not only Guardiola but many of their other candidates were no longer available. The rest was history and not long afterwards so was the unfortunate David Moyes. Before Sunday’s Manchester derby, United’s abortive pursuit of Guardiola remains the great “what if?”, a genuine crossroads moment in the story of these two clubs. It also feels particularly pertinent right now, as City chase a fourth Premier League title in his six years at the club and United contemplate a ninth successive season without a serious challenge. The Guardiola dynasty may not rival Ferguson’s for longevity, but for a club that has always prided itself on thinking two moves ahead, the issue of what comes after him feels of a similar magnitude. How soon is too soon? How late is too late? City has been Guardiola’s club since long before he arrived. It was in the autumn of 2012 they hired Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain with the long-term ambition of luring Guardiola one day. A sparkling new academy was unveiled in 2014. A line of communication was opened with the Guardiola camp even while he was still at Bayern. An informal partnership was established with Girona, the Spanish club part-owned by Guardiola’s brother, Pere. In many respects the entire organisation has been moulded around Guardiola’s vision for a decade. So what happens when he finally goes? What changes and what stays the same? Certainly, given Guardiola’s dazzling era of success, the urge for continuity will be strong. There is no reason to assume Begiristain and Soriano will immediately follow Guardiola out of the door. The existing City blueprint – a spiderweb of affiliate clubs, a world-class scouting system, a state-of-the-art training ground, a commercial strategy based around cashing lots of big cheques from Abu Dhabi companies you never knew existed – will simply be placed in the service of Guardiola’s successor. The football will still be attacking and high-energy. Phil Foden will still do amazing things. In this respect, at least, City fans have little to worry about. But then continuity was the plan at United, too. It is hard to shake the suspicion that Moyes’s appointment was based at least in part on the fact he had the same accent as Ferguson. A playing squad badly in need of refurbishment was largely retained. The footballing infrastructure that essentially existed in Ferguson’s mind was barely upgraded. To this day the pursuit of managers feels skittish, half-baked, reflex. For United, continuity soon morphed into stasis, retreat, nostalgia, chaos. City are a smarter and more functional club than United and will avoid many of these same mistakes. Indeed, given the protracted difficulty of securing top managers these days, it is entirely possible the club hierarchy are already beginning to identify potential hopefuls, whether Mauricio Pochettino, Brendan Rodgers, Julian Nagelsmann, Mikel Arteta, Patrick Vieira or somebody else. In any case, you suspect the process will be a little more sophisticated than simply letting Guardiola pick his own replacement and giving him as long as he wants to do it. But the wider issue is one that engulfs all big clubs in these strange and stormy times. City under Guardiola and its Emirati ownership feel impregnable, immovable, unchangeable. But so did United once under Ferguson. So did Barcelona. So did Chelsea under Roman Abramovich who, in the space of a week, has found himself an outcast. As Ferguson discovered all those years ago, you can plan a pretty picnic. But you can’t predict the weather.",Sport/Football,Manchester City’s post-Pep planning must avoid United’s failures | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/05/manchester-citys-post-pep-guardiola-planning-must-avoid-manchester-uniteds-failures
3/6/2022,"Josef Kordik was sitting in a cafe in Kyiv when a bedraggled man on the street caught his eye. That, he was sure, was Myklova Trusevych, the great Dynamo goalkeeper. He rushed outside. It was spring 1942, a few months after the city had fallen to the Nazis. Kordik was a Moravian who had been left behind after fighting for Austria-Hungary in the first world war. He had not enjoyed his new life and watching football had been his only joy, but the occupation had meant opportunity. He had falsely claimed Volksdeutsch status and been installed as manager of Bakery Number 1. But for most people occupation had brought suffering. Trusevych had sent his wife, who was Jewish, to Odesa to escape the fighting. His home had been destroyed and he was sleeping rough. Kordik offered him work and accommodation at the bakery. Other stricken Dynamo players joined him. When regular football was established as a way of normalising the occupation, the bakery set up a team and proved themselves the best side in the city. They played the Luftwaffe team and beat them 5-1. Three days later, on 9 August, they played them again, winning 5-3 in what became known as the Death Match. No game has ever been so shrouded in myth. In the years immediately after the war, it was in effect hushed up. Should Kyivans really have been playing football with the occupiers? After all, one player was sentenced to five years in the gulag for collaboration while another had emigrated to Canada; by definition, they were not good Soviets. But by the Brezhnev era their victory was celebrated: brave Communists offering hope to the people of Kyiv by beating the Nazis. Details accrued, from the plausible – an SS officer had warned them not to win – to the absurd – the players were shot at during the second half. The bare facts are tragic enough. Around 10 days after the game, the players were arrested, seemingly because, having played for Dynamo, the team of the interior ministry, they were technically members of the NKVD, the Soviet secret police. One, Mykola Korotkykh, had briefly been an active officer and died under torture. The others were sent to a camp near Babyn Yar, a ravine in Kyiv that was the site of a Nazi massacre of Jews in 1941. On 24 February 1943, in reprisal for bomb attacks marking the anniversary of the foundation of the Red Army, one in three prisoners were murdered. Oleksiy Klymenko and Ivan Kuzmenko, both of whom had scored against the Luftwaffe, were killed that morning, along with Trusevych. It is a story that has particular resonance in the present context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but its significance is complex. The term sportswashing may have existed for half a dozen years and the modern practice of states or oligarchs taking control of clubs has taken it into a new phase, but football has had soft-power potential since it became a mass preoccupation in the late 19th century. That can be manipulated, but football is as much a theatre as it is a tool: its soft-power potential is not easily wielded. As the Death Match shows, events are open to multiple interpretations: what one generation feared as collaboration the next saw as heroism; when, in 1971, a memorial was erected to the four players who were killed, it was opposed by the KGB. New meanings are still being teased out of the legend: in Match, a 2012 film about the game directed by Andrey Malyukov, the heroes are Russian‑speaking Communists while those who work with the Nazis speak Ukrainian. Football, hostage as it may now be to finance, has a mischievous tendency to confound the best-laid plans: Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City, for all their investment, have still not won the Champions League, while Chelsea won it for the first time with an interim manager and probably the worst squad they have had since Roman Abramovich’s arrival. It is 17 years since CSKA Moscow, the former army club, became the first Russian side to win a European trophy. At the time, it was still partly owned by the Russian Ministry of Defence and was sponsored by Sibneft, a corporation owned by Abramovich, although he was bought out by Gazprom a few months later. The Ministry of Defence sold its remaining 25% stake to Bluecastle Enterprises, a company registered in London. The remaining 75% is held by the state development corporation VEB.RF whose chairman, Igor Shuvalov, was sanctioned by the UK on Thursday. Bluecastle, run by CSKA’s president, Evgeny Giner, continues to operate freely. Three years after CSKA’s success, Zenit St Petersburg, who have been owned by Gazprom since December 2005, won the Uefa Cup. Russian football seemed on the verge of an era of great success, but the league is now ranked 10th in Europe, behind Scotland. There was perhaps a natural ceiling to Russia’s challenge to the big four or five leagues and limits on foreign players have raised domestic salaries more than quality, but interest has waned since the World Cup and sanctions imposed after the invasion of Crimea in 2014 have had an impact, with Giner’s energy business particularly badly hit. Then there are the indirect consequences of involvement in football. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi takeovers of Manchester City and Newcastle have led to far greater scrutiny in Britain of those countries’ human rights records than would otherwise have been the case. Such investment is seemingly still regarded as a net positive, but there have been costs. Who would have considered the rights of migrant labourers in Qatar before it bid to host a World Cup? The irony of this is that for all Russia’s efforts, most particularly by hosting the World Cup and the Winter Olympics, to use sport as a propaganda tool, it is sport that, before the war, provided probably the most visible examples of Ukraine’s existence. Until Volodymyr Zelenskiy emerged as a hero of resistance, the most famous Ukrainians to the rest of the world were sportsmen, Vitali Klitschko and Andriy Shevchenko. Anybody who followed the Champions League knew Shakhtar and Dynamo. The same soft power Russia tried to exploit also gave Ukraine an identity. In the information war, that is no small matter.",Sport/Football,Russia exploits football as soft-power tool but it also helped forge Ukraine’s identity | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/05/russia-ukraine-soft-power-kyiv-conflict-1942
3/6/2022,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, urged US lawmakers to help provide aircraft to defend the country against Russian invasion during a video meeting with members of Congress on Saturday. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, said Zelenskiy “made a desperate plea” for the military aid, which would include planes, drones and anti-aircraft missiles. The Ukrainian president praised sanctions placed upon Russia during the meeting but pressed US lawmakers to go further by banning oil imports from Moscow. “These planes are very much needed,” Schumer, a Democrat, said in a statement following the gathering of more than 280 senators and House of Representative members. “And I will do all I can to help the administration to facilitate their transfer.” On Friday, Zelenskiy criticized Nato for not imposing a no-fly zone above Ukraine. “All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you,” he warned in a speech. Nato has said sending jets to shoot down Russian planes would risk a severe escalation in the conflict. Russian-made fighter jets familiar to Ukrainian pilots may be sent to the beleaguered country, however, possibly via US allies in Europe. Congress is working on a bipartisan $10bn package of humanitarian and security aid that could facilitate this. Schumer, cited by a source briefed on the call, said Democrats and Republicans were “working very hard” toward passing the relief package, AFP reported. “We will get that assistance of over $10bn in economic, humanitarian and security assistance to the Ukrainian people quickly,” he said. The bipartisan effort was underlined by the Republican senator Steve Daines, who told Fox News after the call that lawmakers were “unified in our support for Ukraine”. Republican senators, including Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham, tweeted their support for Zelenskiy and further measures against Russia following the meeting. Rick Scott, another Republican, said the US should target Russia and Belarus by taking “every action to destroy their economies”. Later on Saturday the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, met with the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, at the Ukraine-Poland border and America’s top diplomat briefly crossed into Ukraine with his counterpart. “The entire world stands with Ukraine, just as I am standing here in Ukraine with my friend, my colleague,” Blinken said. Kuleba said: “I hope the people of Ukraine will be able to see this as a clear manifestation that we have friends who literally stand by us.” The meeting took place amid worsening US-Russian relations, with the state department calling on Americans living or traveling in Russia to “depart immediately” and warning that they face “potential harassment”. Also on Saturday it emerged that Brittney Griner, one of America’s most decorated female basketball players, had been detained last month by Russia’s federal customs service authorities after the discovery of vape cartridges said to have contained hashish oil in her luggage at an airport near Moscow. In Ukraine, Russian forces are attempting to shell and encircle the cities of Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, with numerous reports of civilian areas being hit. Odesa, Ukraine’s largest port city, is under repeated attack from Russian ships, according to Ukrainian officials. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has refused to call off the invasion in face of sanctions that are withering the Russian economy, instead moving to shut down Facebook and Twitter access in the country in an attempt to quell internal dissent. Putin also warned against any Nato-imposed no-fly zone. “That very second, we will view them as participants of the military conflict, and it would not matter what members they are,” he said. The United Nations has warned of a growing humanitarian crisis within Ukraine, with the UN’s World Food Programme saying that millions of people require food aid “immediately”. An estimated 1.4 million people have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries.",News/US news,Zelenskiy calls for US to send aircraft to Ukraine in video call with US Congress,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/05/ukraine-us-congress-zelenskiy-video-call
3/6/2022,"Manchester City continued a remarkable turnaround in their season by coming from behind to secure their first silverware of the 2021-22 campaign. Two goals from the Scotland midfielder Caroline Weir sandwiched Ellen White’s poached effort after Australia forward Sam Kerr had given Chelsea a first-half lead in a fiery encounter. Weir had said before the match that “there’s no better way to keep momentum that than go and win a final” after a challenging start to the season and she took the game by the scruff of the neck to deliver victory for City and heap more pain on Chelsea fans in a week they will want to forget. There is no love lost between Chelsea and City, with the two teams having met seven times in FA Cup or League Cup semi-finals and twice at the quarter-final stage. But they had, inexplicably, never met in a final. In front of an overwhelmingly Chelsea crowd, with Plough Lane 5.5 miles from their own home ground of Kingsmeadow (bought from AFC Wimbledon prior to the team’s move to their new ground), Emma Hayes’s side struggled to prevent City dominating possession. Chelsea arguably were the favourites going into the tie as back-to-back winners of the competition and having done the double over City in the league. However, in a 4-0 away win in Manchester in November the Scottish winger Erin Cuthbert had starred, staying glued to City’s most potent threat, Lauren Hemp, and limited her options. Chelsea were without the dogged Cuthbert due to injury this time. They were also missing their influential forward Fran Kirby, who scored twice and provided four assists in last season’s final, through illness and the Olympic gold medallist Jessie Fleming to Covid. City were unlucky to not be ahead in the 26th minute as Georgia Stanway’s cross was met by the dynamic Hemp but she rattled the ball off the base of the post. The resulting clearance fell to full-back Demi Stokes on the edge of the area, her strike ricocheted off the high arm of Sophie Ingle but the referee, Lisa Benn, waved away the penalty appeals. Hayes had insisted it would be “business as usual” on the pitch after “a long week for people at Chelsea” and, perhaps shaken alive by Hemp’s chance the cup holders started to stretch the City backline. Less than 10 minutes later they had the lead. Katie Zelem scored directly from a corner twice in the space of five minutes as Manchester United thrashed Leicester 4-0 in the Women’s Super League. United were already 2-0 up through first‑half goals from Martha Thomas and Alessia Russo when Zelem’s 60th-minute corner evaded everyone in the penalty area and nestled in the far corner. The 26-year-old, who also scored from a corner in the FA Cup last weekend, amazingly repeated the feat a few minutes later to set the seal on a comprehensive win. The victory lifts Marc Skinner’s side to third in the table, six points behind Arsenal, the leader, who take on the bottom side, Birmingham, today.  In the day’s other game, Maya Le Tissier’s first-half goal against Aston Villa was enough for Brighton to secure a second successive win. PA Media  Guro Reiten’s cross from the left could only be pushed away by Ellie Roebuck as Stokes leant into her while going for the same ball. Kerr collected before turning and firing in low and into the net, racing away to throw herself into arms of the injured Cuthbert. City are no strangers to adversity this season though, with injuries having crippled the first third of their campaign, condemning them to seven defeats in their first 14 games in all competitions. Since then, however, they have lost once in 12 matches – a 1-0 defeat by Chelsea in the league. Unperturbed by their concession and the odds, City started the second half with the intent they had shown early in the first. Five minutes after the restart, they were level. Stanway’s square ball in was taken down by Weir who fired past Ann-Katrin Berger, taking a deflection off her outstretched foot on its way in. With momentum swinging behind City, the England forward White would give them the lead for the first time, poking in the rebound after Berger parried Hemp’s effort. Less than 10 minutes later they extended their lead, again through Weir, who came off the bench in back-to-back Manchester derbies to score prior to starting in the cup final. Stanway’s corner was headed down by Lucy Bronze, then came off Ingle, before falling to Weir who volleyed smartly into the top corner. Hayes rang the changes, throwing Lauren James, Beth England, Drew Spence and Alsu Abdullina into the fray but City were unfazed and always looked the more likely side to score next. Having had his tenure questioned towards the end of last year the final whistle delivered Gareth Taylor his second trophy in charge and denied Hayes No 12.

3/6/2022,"It wasn’t pretty, it wasn’t convincing and for Jürgen Klopp that really doesn’t matter. Liverpool made it 12 successive wins in all competitions with a slender victory over West Ham to keep the pressure firmly on Manchester City ahead of Sunday’s Manchester derby. Liverpool’s 600th Premier League win owed as much to West Ham’s profligacy as Sadio Mané’s predatory instincts, the Senegal international deciding the outcome with a sharp first half finish before Pablo Fornals and Manuel Lanzini missed glorious chances to level. It is now 18 visits to Anfield without a win for David Moyes. His visible anguish as Lanzini skied over with only Alisson to beat was perfectly understandable. West Ham’s hopes of becoming the first team to record a Premier League double over Klopp’s Liverpool receded before kick-off with Declan Rice absent through illness. Moyes paired Lanzini alongside Tomas Soucek and, with his team immediately over-run by Liverpool’s speed of thought and movement, soon switched to a four-man midfield to stem the tide. The title contenders should have been ahead before the readjustment. Merely 69 seconds had elapsed when Trent Alexander-Arnold released Mohamed Salah behind the visiting defence with a quick free-kick, taken with West Ham penalised for offside and failing to spot the right-back’s intentions. Salah was clean through on goal, Kurt Zouma fading into the distance behind him, but Lukasz Fabianski closed down the angle and saved the striker’s placed shot with his leg. Salah found himself free inside the West Ham penalty area moments later and thwarted on this occasion by Craig Dawson’s well-timed challenge. Sandwiched in-between the Salah chances was a back-heeled flick from Virgil van Dijk that drifted wide from another Alexander-Arnold free-kick. Luis Díaz, taking down an Andy Robertson cross beautifully, had a goal-bound volley blocked as Liverpool besieged Fabianski’s goal in a dominant opening. West Ham struggled to escape. Jarrod Bowen’s work was confined to his defensive third, likewise Nikola Vlasic on the left, although the power and pace of Michail Antonio was as always a potent outlet. The centre-forward forced Alisson to tip over when connecting first time with Pablo Fornals’ chip over Ibrahima Konaté. The pair combined again at the end of a flowing break with Antonio cutting inside the Liverpool centre-half before testing Alisson at his near post. The visitors were growing into the game following their uncertain opening, denying Liverpool’s front three space and showing more composure in possession, which made Liverpool’s breakthrough all the more galling from Moyes’ perspective. It unfolded in slow motion. Naby Keïta’s crossfield pass found Alexander-Arnold lurking just outside the West Ham area. The defender controlled on his chest and shot towards the far corner but Mané, ghosting in behind Dawson, intervened to flick the ball beyond Fabianski. VAR took a lengthy look at a possible offside and finally ruled the goalscorer was played on by Dawson’s upper arm. Alexander-Arnold whipped a free-kick just wide of Fabianski’s top corner, with the West Ham goalkeeper rooted to the spot, after Díaz’s blistering run from inside his own half was halted illegally by Zouma. Anfield went to great lengths to condemn the cat kicker. A plane carrying the banner “Cats Lives Matter” flew above the stadium before kick off. When a giant inflatable cat’s head appeared in the Main Stand in the second half, the Kop reworked “Attack, Attack, Attack” to “A Cat, A Cat, A Cat.” Zouma, you suspect, may have been more aggrieved at his forwards’ failure to take one of several excellent chances to equalise. Fornals had a gilt-edged opportunity to level when Ben Johnson’s cross found the playmaker onside and sprinting through a chasm in Liverpool’s central defence. The forward hesitated before chipping the advancing Alisson, but his effort lacked power and Alexander-Arnold was able to hook off the line just as the West Ham fans were celebrating. His clearance gave Fornals a second bite from a header that Alisson palmed away to Vlasic, who was unable to beat Alexander-Arnold on the goal-line. A misplaced header by Van Dijk sent Bowen through on Liverpool’s goal minutes after the restart. He was unable to release a shot before Robertson intervened with a vital challenge. Bowen was helped off moments later with what appeared a serious ankle problem. Lanzini squandered the visitors’ finest chance for a point when Soucek’s cross found him racing into the Liverpool area unmarked. The Argentinian controlled, checked inside Alexander-Arnold but, with the goal at his mercy, blazed over from five yards. Moyes understandably sunk to his haunches with head in hands. Liverpool had their second half moments too with Díaz curling just wide but this was a day when they simply had to dig in and survive. Klopp’s team delivered.",Sport/Football,Sadio Mané winner sinks West Ham to keep up Liverpool’s title pursuit,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/05/liverpool-west-ham-premier-league-match-report
