4/5/2022,"Jia Ruiling’s* father has been enduring severe pain since 17 March. He has late-stage stomach cancer, but his hospital refused to treat him because Jia’s neighbourhood was under lockdown as a result of a handful of Covid cases. “We begged the hospital to accept him again and again,” Jia said. “At some point my father was in so much pain that he wanted to take his life. What can we do? Please, help us let the central government know.” China’s strict zero-Covid policy means all positive cases have to be hospitalised. But in the last few weeks, as case numbers have risen sharply and 26 million people entered a harsh lockdown, mainland China’s most important financial hub has come to a standstill. Medical resources are overwhelmingly diverted to combat Covid, leaving it difficult for non-Covid patients like Jia’s father to access them. Luo Ruixiang*, a 39-year-old Chinese worker in the Republic of the Congo, had a similar experience. He flew home in March in the hope of receiving urgent treatment after damaging his left eye. He landed in Shanghai and informed his quarantine hotel and customs officials of his medical needs, but for more than a week he heard nothing. “I was worried that if I waited until the quarantine was over, I would have already gone blind,” he said. Desperate, Luo went on to the social media site Weibo to plead for help. Local media soon called him, and medical help was quickly on the way. “Thankfully, the operation is done,” he said. “It’s not supposed to be this complicated, but as a small potato everything is so difficult for me.” The Omicron outbreak in Shanghai is the largest test for China’s zero-Covid policy so far, and the city is struggling. On Monday, health officials reported 8,581 asymptomatic and 425 symptomatic cases for the previous 24 hours. The numbers are small compared with countries such as the UK and US, but they are some of the largest in China since the virus was first reported in Wuhan in late 2019. Critics say the city, one of China’s most sophisticated, should have been better prepared. “They have been too successful since 2020, so they became complacent,” Jia said, stressing she was not anti-government but that her father’s suffering had made her “very angry”. “Both the virus and people are changing,” said Chen Xi, a public health expert at Yale School of Public Health. “It is the first time that the subvariant of Omicron, ie BA.2, strikes Shanghai. The unprecedented speed of spreading fast exceeds contact tracing and other conventional public health measures. People also have salient Covid fatigue after two-plus years of stringent health measures.” As lockdown continues in China’s biggest metropolis, the sense of helplessness is overwhelming. Photos and videos that showed young children separated from their parents at a Shanghai hospital stirred anger on social media over the weekend. One parent whose toddler was taken away after testing positive wrote on social media: “I’m so upset … This is inhumane.” Several Shanghai-based EU diplomats sent a letter to the city’s government on 31 March, pressing it to provide assistance to their citizens when they needed medical help. They also urged Shanghai not to separate children from their parents “whatever the circumstances”. Shanghai’s health officials defended the policy on Monday as parents and guardians voiced their anger on social media. Wu Qianyu, an official from the Shanghai municipal health commission, said the policy was integral to efforts to prevent and control the virus. Responding to complaints, Ma Chunlei, the secretary general of Shanghai’s municipal government, admitted on Friday that his administration had handled the outbreak poorly. “Our awareness of the highly infectious and insidious Omicron mutant strain was not sufficient, and our preparation for the significant rise in infections was not comprehensive,” he said. “We sincerely accept your criticism and are working hard to improve it.” Despite the confession, some say things still have not improved. Deng Zhaoyang’s* wife and three-year-old son have been in a government-run quarantine facility since 29 March. “The facility is run by volunteers and no one seems to be in charge. So much so, we don’t even know when they are going to leave the facility, and no one went to do Covid tests for them either,” he said. Deng, who emigrated to the city as an adult years ago, said that in the last couple of years when things were normal and other parts of China grappled with outbreaks, he had never thought the same thing would happen in Shanghai. “Before Omicron arrived, it was understandable that those who got it should be sent to quarantine facilities,” he said. “But now most of them only have mild symptoms. Shouldn’t the government adjust their policy accordingly?” The sense of frustration is shared by some of the city’s medical professionals. In a revealing phone conversation last week that has been making the rounds online at home and abroad , a official at the Shanghai Chinese centre for disease control and prevention (CDC) said the city’s medical resources were under severe strain. “I’ve already suggested [to higher officials] multiple times that those with mild or no symptoms should just be quarantined at home,” she said, adding that current efforts to control the virus were more about politics. “But who has listened to me?” Some Chinese internet users, however, called her “wrong” and “dangerous”. On Saturday, Shanghai Pudong CDC said it was investigating the caller’s complaint. It also issued an internal notice, telling staff who answer the hotline to speak with one voice. On the same day, Sun Chunlan, a Chinese vice-premier, stressed “unswerving adherence to the dynamic zero-Covid approach” on an official visit to Shanghai, according to Xinhua. Less than 24 hours later, the Chinese military dispatched more than 2,000 medics to Shanghai to support efforts to curb the spread of the virus. Jin Dong-yan, a professor at Hong Kong University’s school of biomedical sciences, said it would be weeks before the virus could be under control. “Even if they can achieve zero Covid with exceedingly high cost, another accident might cause another major surge … Living with the virus is the only viable option,” he said. A large part of “living with the virus” is to do with an effective vaccine. Officials have begun talking openly in recent months about mRNA vaccines, an indication that the authorities may have been thinking about adopting vaccines other than the Chinese-made Sinopharm and Sinovac. Dr Zhong Nanshan, the country’s top respiratory expert, said in December that China should learn about the good things in other countries, such as mRNA vaccines. The Shanghai government also said in an official document last week that it supported importing vaccines and Covid treatment drugs. “Deploying rapid antigen tests [RAT] and approval of mRNA vaccines are both doable as they have ample data for [the authorities] to approve mRNA vaccine as well as adequate capacity to mass manufacture RAT,” Chen said, adding that both low vaccination rates among older adults and the vaccine technology being used in China were “worrisome”. “The remaining time window is fast shrinking,” he said. “It is so important for other regions in China to learn and ramp up vaccination before the local surge begins.” For Jia, the idea of living with the virus seems remote. She just hopes her father will be sent to his cancer hospital as soon as possible. “His pain has alleviated as a result of bigger doses of painkillers in the last couple of days, but this is not a sustainable solution. He needs to see the doctor,” she said. Since Jia revealed her father’s ordeal online last week, she said she had been receiving attention from the media. Perhaps because of the pressure, her local district authorities had called her to say they could send her father to the hospital. “They had one requirement though,” she said. “They wanted me to take down my social media posts first. I refused. They did not manage to send my father to the cancer hospital in the end, because they are only a district-level authority, and they were unable to persuade a municipal-level institution after all.” * Names have been changed to protect identities",News/World news,‘This is inhumane’: the cost of zero Covid in Shanghai,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/this-is-inhumane-the-cost-of-zero-covid-in-shanghai
4/5/2022,"A cross-party group of MPs and peers has joined forces with UK universities in calling for the visa scheme for Ukrainian refugees to be extended to temporary placements for students and academics. In a letter to Priti Patel, the home secretary, the parliamentarians and Universities UK, the advocacy organisation for universities, said the scheme should provide visas and temporary places for displaced students and academics to study and carry out research. Led by Andrew Rosindell, the Conservative MP for Romford, who is a member of the foreign affairs committee, the group also includes the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey; David Blunkett, the Labour peer and former education secretary; and Tom Tugendhat, the Tory backbencher who chairs the foreign affairs committee. The government has so far introduced two systems to allow Ukrainians displaced by the Russian invasion of their country to come to the UK – a scheme for family members of people already in the country, and one by which individuals or organisations can sponsor people to arrive. The latest Home Office statistics showed that of 32,800 applications via the family scheme, 24,400 visas had been issued. With the sponsorship route, 150,000 expressed interest in sponsoring people, with 32,200 formally applying to do so, and 4,700 visas issued. The letter argues that the amount of interest shown in the sponsorship system illustrates that many Britons are willing to help, and that the students and academics visa would help shelter more people until they are ready to return home. As well as offering “sanctuary” to students and academics, the proposal says that allowing young Ukrainians to continue studying subjects such as medicine and engineering will help them gain qualifications that will be vital in Ukraine when the war is over. “It is vital that President Putin’s narrative that Ukraine is not a country is firmly and unequivocally rebutted and the bravery and collective struggle of the Ukrainian people is properly documented,” Rosindell said. “Only by giving Ukrainian academia a safe home can this be ensured. Already individual universities and institutions are offering positions to Ukrainian academics, but today we call for this to be extended to state programmes and to students as well, with the necessary financial support for universities to implement this.” Blunkett said it would be “a tragedy if the young people who form the future for rebuilding the country and offering the powerhouse of innovation and creativity were to be denied the continuation of their education and research opportunities because of the actions of President Putin”. He added: “Offering the opportunity to resume learning with appropriate support in the UK’s higher education system is just one small, but important, step in making our commitments to the Ukrainian people a reality”. A government spokesperson said: “Anyone currently studying in the UK is already covered by our Ukraine extension scheme, meaning they will automatically qualify for three years’ leave to remain here. “We are moving as quickly as possible to ensure that those fleeing Ukraine can find safety in the UK through the Ukraine family scheme and Homes for Ukraine, with almost 30,000 visas issued in the last three weeks alone and thousands more expected to come through these uncapped routes.”",News/World news,UK politicians  request visa scheme for Ukrainian students and academics ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/uk-politicians-request-visa-scheme-for-ukrainian-students-and-academics
4/5/2022,"Gambling and betting companies will be banned from using advertising featuring top-flight footballers and other sports personalities, as well as reality TV and social media stars, under new rules designed to protect under-18s and other vulnerable groups. The changes, set out by the body responsible for the UK code for advertising, will mean that past betting and gambling marketing that features stars and celebrities such as Cristiano Ronaldo, José Mourinho, Michael Owen and Harry Redknapp, would not be allowed in the UK. The wide-ranging new rules also include a ban on showing specific teams’ football kit and stadiums in ads, as well as using video game content and gameplay popular with under-18s. “No more top-flight footballers or other high-profile sportspeople promoting the latest odds,” said Shahriar Coupal, the director of the Committee of Advertising Practice, which sets the rules enforced by the UK’s advertising watchdog. “No more social media influencers, TV stars or other celebrities popular with children inviting us to bet on red. And, no more gambling ads featuring video game images or gameplay familiar to many children’s lives.” Under the current rules, an advert is banned only if it is likely to appeal more to an under-18 than to an adult. Under the new rules, an ad will be banned if it is “likely to be of strong appeal to children or young persons, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture”, regardless of how it may be viewed by adults. The new rules come into force from October, in the run-up to football’s World Cup in Qatar the following month, a sporting event around which gambling and betting companies traditionally spend heavily on marketing to attract gamblers. However, the Advertising Standards Authority, the body that enforces the UK ad code, does not have the power to regulate in the contentious area of team sponsors. “This might not seem immediately significant but its effect – particularly in a World Cup year – will be dramatic,” Coupal said. “By ending these practices, our new rules invite a new era for gambling ads, more particular to the adult audience they can target and more befitting of the age-restricted product they’re promoting.” The new rules will ban the use of any celebrity, from sports stars to Love Island contestants, with a significant fanbase of under-18s, in betting and gambling ads. The rules apply to broadcast media, such as TV, radio and cinema ads, as well as non-broadcast such as online and in newspapers or on billboards and posters. The ASA said that children were still seeing on average 2.2 betting or gambling ads a week, although this is the lowest level in 12 years, with existing rules banning anyone under the age of 25 being used in an ad.",News/Society,UK to ban gambling ads featuring sports and reality TV stars,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/05/uk-to-ban-gambling-ads-featuring-sports-and-reality-tv-stars
4/5/2022,"Hospital inspectors have uncovered repeated maternity failings and expressed serious concern about the safety of mothers and babies in Sheffield just days after a damning report warned there had been hundreds of avoidable baby deaths in Shrewsbury. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) found Sheffield teaching hospitals NHS foundation trust, one of the largest NHS trusts in England, had failed to make the required improvements to services when it visited in October and November, despite receiving previous warnings from the watchdog. As well as concerns across the wider trust, a focused inspection on maternity raised significant issues about the way its service is run. When it came to medical staff at the Sheffield trust, the “service did not have enough medical staff with the right qualifications, skills, and experience to keep women and babies safe from avoidable harm and to provide the right care and treatment”, the report said. It comes less than a week after the Ockenden report on the UK’s biggest maternity scandal at Shrewsbury and Telford hospital NHS trust concluded that 201 babies and nine mothers could have or would have survived if an NHS trust had provided better care. Police are examining more than 600 cases linked to the scandal, the Guardian reported last week. The CQC previously identified significant patient safety concerns in Sheffield in March 2021, which led to the rating of the maternity service deteriorating to inadequate. Its reinspection, it said, found “there was little or no improvement to the quality of care patients received … in some areas the service had deteriorated further”. It also had “significant concerns about the assessment of patients in the labour ward assessment unit, maternity staffing and delays in induction of labour”, it added. Inspectors found that staff were not interpreting, classifying or escalating measures of a baby’s heart rate properly, an issue that was raised by Donna Ockenden in her review of the Shrewsbury scandal. Despite foetal monitoring being highlighted as an area needing attention in 2015 and 2021, the most recent inspection “highlighted that the service continued to lack urgency and pace in implementing actions and recommendations to mitigate these risks, therefore exposing patients to risk of harm”. The report added: “We were informed by staff that there were often difficulties requesting additional assistance when women’s health was deteriorating. Staff told us that there were occasions when they would ‘bleep’ for medical assistance on more than one occasion before assistance arriving. We were also told on multiple occasions that there were instances where an emergency call buzzer would be pulled after receiving no response to multiple bleep calls.” The CQC was told there were “very unsafe staffing levels on labour ward”, while foetal monitoring was not always completed on time and drugs and observations were late. The CQC also said it was concerned that not all incidents or serious incidents were investigated, the root cause identified, or that lessons were learned. Precisely the same concern was raised in Shrewsbury. The trust’s overall rating has been downgraded from “good” to “requires improvement”. Its chief executive, Kirsten Major, said she was “devastated” by the findings, and took them “extremely seriously”. She added: “We have already taken action that will help us improve, including recruiting over 500 new nurses who are now working on the wards, and there have been changes to our maternity services including investing in more midwives.”",News/Society,Repeated maternity failings uncovered in Sheffield NHS trust,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/05/repeated-maternity-failings-uncovered-in-sheffield-nhs-trust
4/5/2022,"Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney on Monday brought to three the number of Republican senators to say they would vote in favor of supporting Ketanji Brown Jackson as Joe Biden’s nominee to the US supreme court. Murkowski of Alaska put out a statement on Monday evening saying: “After multiple in-depth conversations with Judge Jackson and deliberative review of her record and recent hearings, I will support her historic nomination to be an Associate Justice on the US supreme court.” Then Romney, the Utah senator and former presidential candidate, issued a statement in which he praised Jackson as a well-qualified jurist and “a person of honor”. He congratulated her on “her expected confirmation”. I intend to vote in support of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to be an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. My statement: pic.twitter.com/uGaxx8sJn5 Last week the Republican Susan Collins of Maine was the first from her party to say she was a “yes” on Jackson, guaranteeing a bipartisan aspect to her confirmation days after an acrimonious Senate confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill. Jackson is unlikely to need any Republican votes but the support of moderages Murkowski, Romney and Collins, at least, will be a huge fillip to Joe Biden’s efforts to appeal across the aisle. Earlier on Monday, a deadlocked Senate judiciary committee voted on partisan lines to advance the nomination of Jackson, putting Biden’s nominee on track to become the first Black woman confirmed to the supreme court. Following days that included harsh questioning from Republicans and debate over Jackson’s judicial record and qualifications, the committee vote was evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, 11-11. The tie forced Democrats to deploy a rare procedural move requiring a separate vote to “discharge” Jackson’s nomination from the committee to the Senate floor. The panel’s split decision will only delay but not derail Jackson’s nomination to replace the retiring justice Stephen Breyer, the most senior member of the court’s minority liberal wing. But the committee vote along party lines underscored the intense partisan acrimony that has come to define modern supreme court nomination proceedings. Opening the meeting on Monday morning, Dick Durbin of Illinois, the committee’s Democratic chair, praised Jackson’s “impeccable qualifications” and said her experience as a public defender would bring a “missing perspective to the court”. “Hers is a uniquely American family story, how much hope and promise can be achieved in just one generation,” Durbin said. “I’m proud we can bear witness to it.” The committee spent the morning debating Jackson’s nomination, sparring over many of the same issues that the senators discussed with her privately during their one-on-one meetings with the judge and publicly during days of hearings that included personal testimony and combative rounds of questioning about her judicial record. But before the vote could occur, Democrats briefly recessed the meeting to await the arrival of the California Democrat Alex Padilla, whose overnight flight to Washington had been diverted due to a medical emergency onboard and was delayed. Like the full Senate, the committee’s 22 members are evenly divided between the parties, meaning Democrats needed Padilla’s vote to force a tie and advance Jackson’s nomination. Democrats and the White House hope to confirm Jackson to the lifetime position on the court before Congress recesses for the Easter holiday on Friday. The 51-year-old was confirmed by the Senate to the US court of appeals for the DC circuit last year with the support of three Republicans. Only one of those Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine, has committed to voting for her again. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has said he will not support Jackson’s nomination to the supreme court​​, calling her an “activist to the core”, outside the judicial mainstream. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska has not said how she intends to vote, but is seen as one of only two more Republicans, along with Mitt Romney of Utah, who might support Jackson. If confirmed, Jackson would make history as the first Black woman and only the sixth woman to sit on the court in its more than 200-year history. Her confirmation would, however, do little to change the ideological balance of the court, in which conservatives outnumber liberals 6-3. During the morning debate, Durbin lamented Republican hostility toward Jackson, accusing senators of leveraging “vile” and “discredited” attacks on her record and character. “She stayed calm and collected. She showed dignity, grace and poise,” Durbin said. “It is unfortunate that our hearing came to that, but if there is one positive to take away from these attacks, it is that the nation got to see the temperament of a good, strong person truly ready to serve on the highest court in the land.” Republicans had sought to portray Jackson as “soft on crime”, a line of attack dismissed outright by the American Bar Association, which testified that she was strongly qualified for the position. Republicans on the committee appear uniformly opposed to Jackson’s nomination, starting with the ranking member, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who announced he would not vote to confirm Jackson because “she and I have fundamental, different views on the role of judges and the role that they should play in our system of government”. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, compared proceedings on Jackson’s nomination to Festivus, the holiday celebrated on the TV series Seinfeld. “There’s been a lot of airing of grievances,” Booker said, adding: “I’ve heard things that are just ridiculous.” During more than 30 hours of hearings last month, Jackson pledged to be an independent justice who would decide cases from a “neutral position”. She defended her record while reflecting on her personal story as the daughter of public school teachers in the segregated south. As the 22-member panel convened on Monday, Joe Biden said Jackson would “bring extraordinary qualifications, deep experience and intellect, and a rigorous judicial record to the supreme court. “She deserves to be confirmed as the next justice.” The NAACP condemned panel Republicans. “It’s a stain on the committee that this vote was not unanimous,” NAACP president Derrick Johnson said, urging Jackson’s confirmation. “History will be watching.”",News/US news,Two more Republicans back Ketanji Brown Jackson for supreme court,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/04/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-senate-vote
4/5/2022,"Australian rugby has been given a once-in-a-generation opportunity to revitalise the game in this country with the prospect of hosting back-to-back men’s and women’s World Cups only two years apart. In a tremendous fillip for the game, Australia was on Monday named the preferred candidate to host the women’s World Cup in 2029, along with the men’s tournament in 2027. The dual World Cups have put Australia in a superb position to capitalise on the enormous global popularity of rugby, with the potential to deliver a much-needed financial boost. But it is an opportunity Australian rugby cannot afford to fumble as poor performances in the home tournaments would be disastrous for the game. The Wallabies are currently ranked sixth in the world, just one place above their lowest-ever position, and are well behind the likes of the All Blacks, France, South Africa and even England as favourites to win the 2023 World Cup in France. Australian rugby fans will be hoping the Wallabies can turn things around next year, but there is certainly enough time to build a winning team for 2027. Hosting the World Cup will help Australia to create a potential champion Wallabies team. by enabling Rugby Australia to secure lucrative sponsorships and an improved broadcast deal in the lead-up to the showpiece event. A significant increase in revenue would help RA to retain and recruit talent for the 2027 World Cup campaign. At present there are almost as many Australians playing professional rugby overseas as there are in Australia, including several high-profile Wallabies such as second-rower Rory Arnold, centre Samu Kerevi, winger Marika Koroibete and five-eighth Quade Cooper. A tweak to the so-called Giteau Law means coach Dave Rennie will be permitted to select three eligible overseas-based players for the 2023 World Cup. But if RA was capable of generating more income in the lead-up to the 2027 World Cup, Australia may be able to bring back required Wallabies from overseas to play Super Rugby and keep other players from leaving, making the Giteau Law redundant. It is also possible some players may choose to play in Australia to improve their chances of playing in a home World Cup, which would be a career highlight for many. Extra money in the coffers would also give RA the chance to poach a high-profile rugby league player or two, who could possibly add value to the Wallabies. Hosting the women’s World Cup two years later has the potential to drive enormous growth in the game, after it has taken Australia’s football codes a long time to realise that women make up 50% of the population. The A-League, AFL, NRL and Super Rugby all boast women’s leagues, but Australia’s national women’s rugby team are virtually invisible. The Wallaroos have competed in the women’s World Cup since 1998, finishing third in 2010, but only diehard fans would be aware. A successful home World Cup could dramatically enhance the Wallaroos’ public profile and potentially put them on a pedestal with the Matildas and the Australian women’s cricket team. The USA hosted and won the 1999 women’s Fifa World Cup, leaving a wonderful legacy for football in America. The Wallaroos have the opportunity to do something similar for women’s rugby in Australia in 2029. They are currently ranked fifth in the world, one place better than the Wallabies, but their problem is they rarely play Test rugby. Hosting in 2029 should begin to attract more international women’s teams to Australia to prepare for the event, lifting their profile. The Wallaroos have never enjoyed the same kind of success as their Australian sevens counterparts, but they can learn from their experience in the Olympic Games. When Tim Walsh was appointed coach of the women’s sevens side in 2013 he actively recruited athletes from other sports to build the 2016 Olympic gold medal-winning team. If the Wallaroos can gain a higher profile and secure more sponsorship dollars, they may be in a position to emulate the sevens program and recruit players from other sports to give the team a real chance of success in 2029. It is imperative both the Wallabies and the Wallaroos are at their absolute best when the world’s focus is on Australia. Anything less than reaching the semi-finals of the tournaments on home soil would be regarded as monumental failures, particularly for the Wallabies, and would be counter-productive. RA must also be careful that any multi-million windfalls generated by the two tournaments are not squandered like the bonanza from Australia’s hosting of the 2003 men’s tournament. A Jonny Wilkinson field goal in extra-time downed the Wallabies in the 2003 final in Sydney but then Rugby Australia failed to invest a $44m windfall in a future fund, which would have safeguarded the game and helped it to grow. Sadly, the game in Australia declined, but it has now been given a double-sided chance to revive itself.",Sport/Sport,Hosting two Rugby World Cups is an opportunity Australia cannot afford to fumble | Bret Harris,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/05/hosting-two-rugby-world-cups-is-an-opportunity-australia-cannot-afford-to-fumble
4/5/2022,"Mikel Arteta rued the consequences of an “unacceptable” performance from his Arsenal side at Crystal Palace and admitted he had not anticipated anything like the 3-0 defeat that raises serious question marks about their top four hopes. Arsenal were flat all night and got what they deserved against their superior hosts. They remain fifth in the table on goal difference behind Spurs and, while they have a game in hand, they must visit their north London rivals next month. “We weren’t at the races, especially in the first half,” Arteta said. “We were late to every ball, we were soft in the duels and we didn’t earn the right to play. We were sloppy on the ball and we didn’t have any dominance, any sequences of play where we could take some control of the game and we conceded two poor goals [before half-time]. Overall it’s unacceptable. We put our hands up, apologise, regroup.” Asked whether he had seen the defeat coming, Arteta said Arsenal had failed to heed his warnings before the game. “No, I could not see it,” he said. “We discussed it just before kick-off, the way you win here is when you compete the way you should. That means you win duels, have presence and the composure on the pitch to manage certain situations. They are a really physical team and the pitch is not the best to do that, so you have to find a way to do other things that usually you don’t have to do. We didn’t manage to do that.” Kieran Tierney, who could miss the rest of the season with a knee injury, was absent and Thomas Partey departed early in a development that clearly concerned Arteta. Arsenal’s squad depth is already thin but Arteta refused to use it as mitigation. “It’s what we have,” he said. “We lost Kieran, we lost Thomas now and that’s it. With the players that we have we will try, like we’ve been trying since the start of the season.” Patrick Vieira was delighted with Palace’s display against his old club, which gave them a first home league win since 28 December. “I am really proud,” he said. “We played a really good game of football. We defended well and took our chances.”",Sport/Football,Mikel Arteta calls Arsenal performance against Crystal Palace ‘unacceptable’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/04/mikel-arteta-calls-arsenal-performance-against-crystal-palace-unacceptable
4/5/2022,"Priti Patel’s nationality and borders bill has been ripped apart for a second time by the House of Lords as the government suffered more than 10 defeats over controversial proposals to tighten immigration rules. Peers supported proposals to ensure that the bill complied with the 1951 Refugee Convention and challenged the government’s plan to redefine refugees into two classes based on how they arrived in the UK. They also voted to allow asylum seekers to work if their case had not been resolved within six months; to require formal returns agreements with third states to ensure safe returns; and to allow unaccompanied child asylum seekers in Europe to join a family member legally in the UK. A succession of votes went against the government as the session in the House of Lords crept towards midnight. Amendments on protection and support for victims of modern slavery passed – one by just a single vote. After 12 defeats, the only vote to go in the government’s favour was over whether the best interests of a child must be the “primary consideration” in decisions about under-18s. The defeats, following similar rejections in the upper chamber earlier in the year, mean that ministers could be forced to make concessions if they are to ease the bill through the second chamber amid an increasingly tight legislative logjam. The government is expected to prorogue parliament later this month, but still has a number of major bills to take through both houses. The usual convention is that the Lords is expected to give way if MPs make it plain they do not back amendments from peers. But the lack of remaining time means a miscalculation by the government could force concessions or cause the bill to fall. Peers defeated the government in demanding extra safeguards over a measure that would allow people to be stripped of their British citizenship without warning. In another government defeat, peers backed by 163 votes to 138 to remove a broad provision making it a criminal offence to knowingly arrive in the UK without permission, limiting it to only those who breach a deportation order. In yet another blow to the Conservative administration, a demand for unaccompanied child asylum seekers in Europe to be allowed to join a family member legally in the UK was backed by 181 votes to 144. The Conservatives’ Lord Cormack, who was an MP for 40 years, said the bill was “largely unnecessary … narrow, mean minded and at times approaches the vindictive” and is “in danger of breaching international law but also international humanity”. A motion put forward by Labour’s Lady Chakrabarti received support from several senior Conservative peers. She argued that the UK courts should have a role in ensuring that the bill is compliant with the UN 1951 convention and the 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees. “As a public and constitutional lawyer, I take the primacy of the other place very seriously. This is neither a money nor manifesto matter. It gives effect to the government’s own stated policy of refugee convention compliance in times when this could not be more important. No reasonable government should object,” she said. Crossbench peer former lord chief justice Lord Judge and crossbencher former supreme court justice Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood both supported her amendment. Brown said: “Several of these provisions flagrantly breach our obligations as interpreted by the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees].” Tory frontbencher Lady Williams of Trafford defended the move to create a criminal offence for unauthorised entry to the UK. “There is a need to seek prosecutions where there are aggravating circumstances and where prosecutors agree that this is in the public interest,” she said.",News/World news,Priti Patel’s immigration bill suffers multiple defeats in Lords ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/priti-patels-immigration-bill-suffers-at-least-10-defeats-in-lords

In February he suffered a hairline fracture of a bone in his left hand when he fell over playing table tennis against Sergio García during a tournament in Jeddah. His doctors and his coaches told him he should take the next four months off to recover but here he is teeing up at Augusta National despite their advice. “It was a huge risk,” he said, “but I decided to do so because I wanted to give this tournament a run.” He says his game is at about 80 per cent. It is not just his hand; he has a hip injury, too, a partial tear in the cartilage because of his extreme clubhead speed and strength training regimen. His world ranking has dropped back to No 14 now and he says himself that his buildup to this year’s tournament feels very different from how it did in November 2020, when he came here off the back of his six-shot victory in the US Open at Winged Foot. “Coming here in the fall for that Masters, a lot of eyes were on me, and it was a different expectation level and definitely uncomfortable for me because I had never experienced that,” DeChambeau said. But this year, “coming off an injury, not being really fully ready it’s kind of been nice going into this year’s Masters just peacefully.” He admits it helps, too, that Tiger Woods is now taking up all the attention with his own comeback. Woods’ gallery is so big that DeChambeau says the atmosphere surrounding everyone else almost feels relaxing in comparison. “It’s very, very exciting to have him back. It creates a lot of hype and whatnot. From the driving range, we could hear the loud roar when he came out of the clubhouse up to that first tee.” He has tried to get in touch with Phil Mickelson, too, after the recent scandal about his comments on doing business with the Saudi regime. “I’ve tried to reach out but he’s gone dark. There’s no contact,” DeChambeau said. His results here have been underwhelming since he finished 21st on his debut in 2016, when he was the low amateur. It would be a hell of an achievement if he does better than 21st this week.",Sport/Sport,Injured Bryson DeChambeau enjoying lower profile before 2022 Masters,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/04/injured-bryson-dechambeau-enjoying-lower-profile-before-2022-masters
4/5/2022,"Fresh questions have been raised over Prince Andrew’s Dragons’ Den-style scheme after it emerged that concerns were raised over a contest winner who since been linked to more than £1m of payments received by the royal. Selman Turk, a Turkish businessman, received an award in November 2019 from the Duke of York at a Pitch@Palace event during which 40 entrepreneurs gave rapid-fire pitches in a room full of potential investors. Turk won the “People’s Choice” award for his business Heyman AI, a digital bank aimed at millennials, which later went bust. His victory was decided by a public vote online and an audience vote on the night. The Guardian has learned that the day after the event, concerns were raised with Amanda Thirsk, then a senior member of the royal household, who said she would look into suggestions that entrepreneurs could game the system. In an exchange with Thirsk, seen by this newspaper, she was told Heyman AI’s win “did not feel right or make sense”, adding “it would be [a] shame if people were gaming the system”. Thirsk replied: “I also think your point is right that a campaign to ‘game’ the position is not quite in keeping … we will certainly look at this again for next time.” A number of participants have told the Guardian they found Turk’s Pitch@Palace win unusual as he “won it by miles” and his pitch was “crap”, with some suspecting he may have used bots – autonomous internet programs – to boost his vote. In his live pitch, available to watch online, Turk forgets his words and before he can finish, he is cut off by the trumpets of the duke’s grenadiers. Turk, Pitch@Palace representatives and Thirsk have been approached for comment. It has since been alleged in court documents that Turk instructed a Turkish millionaire, 77-year-old Nebahat Isbilen, to pay Andrew £750,000 nine days after the Pitch@Palace event, and the duke is also said to have received payments of up to £350,000 from a company linked to Turk. Details of the payments, which the duke has declined to comment on, emerged last week for the first time in a case Isbilen launched against Turk in the high court, alleging he defrauded her to the tune of £40m. Turk denies the allegations. Since the legal proceedings against Turk emerged, it has been reported that the businessman first met Andrew between May and June 2019 at Windsor Castle – about six months before the Pitch@Palace event. A source familiar with the event said they believed Turk received as many as 10,000 votes, whereas some other participants polled closer to the hundreds. One of the 2019 participants told the Guardian: “There was a group of us on the day that felt the People’s Choice award hadn’t felt right during that competition. “Because their pitch was crap … Their whole concept was bizarre in that they were pitching for something when they didn’t have a licence. There was a group of us who felt it didn’t [seem] right that they had won the People’s Choice because they won it by miles. “A few of us made the assumption, rightly or wrongly, that we thought … bots [must have been used] to do this because the way the awards worked was you were actively told to go on your network and get people to vote for you.” Another 2019 participant told the Guardian: “Our initial surprise at Heyman AI winning that particular award makes more sense now. “We watched all the pitches and Heyman AI didn’t stand out. Further, there seemed to be some more impactful companies that the typical member of the public would be drawn to, that is, those actually helping people as opposed to a new banking app. “I think our thoughts were that they had mobilised more friends and family/social media followers. It was very much an innocent ‘I wonder how they did that?’ as opposed to assuming anything malevolent. We weren’t expecting to win, but at least we thought it was set up as a fair contest.” It was reported that Turk met Andrew in London on at least two occasions after the Pitch@Palace event, including at a dinner with potential investors at Turk’s apartment in South Kensington on 5 December 2019, and in February 2020 at Frogmore House, the royal residence in Windsor Great Park. Turk has admitted in his defence statement, provided to the court and seen by the Guardian, that he held meetings with Andrew at his flat in September 2019 – two months before the Pitch@Palace event. But he claims he did not instruct Isbilen to pay Andrew £750,000 and she did so on her own initiative. Lawyers for Isbilen have been asked to confirm whether or not it is her case that she knew Andrew.",News/UK news,New questions raised over Prince Andrew’s award to Selman Turk,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/04/new-questions-raised-over-prince-andrews-award-to-selman-turk
4/5/2022,"Was this the night Arsenal’s wheels came off? Mikel Arteta will hope it was an isolated off day in a largely excellent season but his players did not turn up here and were thoroughly beaten by energetic, highly-motivated opponents who outdid them in every department. That would normally be problematic enough at this stage in the race for a Champions League spot but the angst did not end there; the sight of Tottenham unexpectedly occupying fourth place presents a headache but they departed with added concerns that may skew the next few weeks against them. Chief among them was an injury to Thomas Partey, who limped off shortly after Wilfried Zaha had scored an excellent Crystal Palace side’s third goal from the penalty spot. Partey had, like almost all of his teammates, put in a crushingly disappointing display and had conceded a number of cheap fouls; Arsenal’s squad is so thin, though, that it was impossible to miss the worry in Arteta’s voice when he said the midfielder had aggravated an old injury. “A big concern” was how the manager put it, and it was the best way to capture the entire evening. Equally worrying will be the fact that Kieran Tierney, who did not appear at all because of the knee injury, will see a specialist tomorrow and risks missing the rest of the season.While nobody in an Arsenal shirt can escape blame for a woefully inadequate performance, The drop off in standard between Tierney and his deputy was glaring. Nuno Tavares endured a torrid first 45 minutes and was replaced by Arteta at half-time, the explanation that it was purely a tactical decision not sounding entirely convincing. It was, at least, 10 minutes longer than Tavares lasted when he was hauled off at Nottingham Forest in his previous start; the 22-year-old may need an arm round the shoulder if he is to fill in effectively over the remainder of the campaign. Palace had started at a ferocious tempo, Conor Gallagher setting it by tearing towards the returning Aaron Ramsdale within two minutes, and had clearly been under instruction not to let a normally fast-starting sidethe away side settle. But Arsenal’s errors were not all forced: when Ramsdale and Ben White, such reliable distributors from the back, both fed aimless balls all the way through to Vicente Guaita in the opening stages it was clear things were not right. Patrick Vieira, whose team had largely bested Arsenal during a 2-2 draw at the Emirates in the autumn, had primed his players to capitalise and they did so with glee. Jean-Philippe Mateta’s opener came with an element of luck but it was as much as Palace deserved. When Gallagher swung a free-kick over from deep on the left, Joachim Anderson was facing away from the ball as he challenged a weak Tavares at the far post. It struck him on the back of the head and, while he had undoubtedly intended to get some purchase, he could hardly have expected it to zip across the six-yard box and perfectly into Mateta’s path. The centre-forward could not miss and Ramsdale had no hope of stopping his header at point-blank range. Rather than drop deep in the manner that restrained Manchester City three weeks previously, Palace kept going. The second goal was wonderfully created from their point of view but, from Arsenal’s, a precis of all that was wrong. Alexandre Lacazette lost a 50/50 challenge far too easily and, when the ball was worked back to Andersen, worse would follow. A flat, raking 40-yard pass from halfway was wonderfully executed but a sliding Gabriel Magalhaes made a complete hash of his interception while Tavares, mystifyingly perched a yard behind his defensive colleagues, looked on. It left Jordan Ayew in the clear; he beat Ramsdale confidently to his right and Palace, who simply seemed hungrier, had a level of reward they might not have imagined. Arteta deployed Gabriel Martinelli in Tavares’ place and around the hour mark Arsenal perked up slightly. Martin Ødegaard should have pulled a goal back but dragged wide and then, running back into his own box, clipped Wilfried Zaha for a penalty award nobody could dispute. Zaha, who was passed fit and proved a thorn in Arsenal’s side yet again, did the rest and a couple of late saves from Guaita preserved Palace’s hugely merited clean sheet. Almost five years ago to the week Palace defeated Arsenal by the same scoreline and contributed heavily to the end of their long sequence of top-four finishes under Arsène Wenger. The fear for Arteta will be that grievous damage has now been done to their hopes of a return and a quirk of the Premier League’s scheduling means a fixture announcement made shortly before kick-off has even more resonance now. Arsenal will visit Tottenham on 12 May, three games from the end of the season; it would be as well to circle that in the calendar and, before then, Arteta faces a daunting task to regain the initiative.",Sport/Football,"Mateta, Ayew and Zaha on target as Palace dent Arsenal’s top four hopes",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/04/crystal-palace-arsenal-premier-league-match-report
4/5/2022,"The government is expected to announce that, after months of wrangling, it will privatise Channel 4, four decades after it aired its first programme; a staple for the broadcaster – Countdown. Here’s the station’s journey from launch by Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government to Monday’s announcement about its privatisation. Channel 4 airs for the first time in November, two years after an act of parliament paved the way for its launch. The channel was to be publicly owned but commercially funded through advertising. Richard Whiteley, who hosted Countdown until 2005, was the first presenter to appear on screen. The long-running soap Brookside was also broadcast on its launch date. Margaret Thatcher rejects the idea of privatising the channel, fearing it would reduce quality. Cabinet members in John Major’s government pass an indicative vote to look at its privatisation, but its then chairman, Sir Michael Bishop, persuades Major to drop the idea. A revised “public service” duty for Channel 4 is emphasised in the Communications Act. It says that it should provide a “broad range of high quality and diverse programming”, including appealing “to the tastes and interests of a culturally diverse society”. Months after winning a parliamentary majority in the general election, David Cameron tells the Commons that he is open to the idea of “private investment” in the broadcaster. In response to speculation about the government potentially privatising the channel, a House of Lords committee finds that the drawbacks of privatisation outweigh any potential benefits. Its report says that news, current affairs and film would be at risk. “We are concerned that … a private owner may seek to dilute C4C’s public service remit in future, in order to maximise profit,” the report added. Channel 4 is cleared of bias by Ofcom after replacing Boris Johnson with a melting block of ice during a general election leadership debate on climate change. During the election a campaign source tells the Guardian that the party will review its licence, amid accusations of bias from Conservatives. The Conservative media minister John Whittingdale tells a party conference fringe event that the government is considering “whether there is still a need for a second publicly owned public service broadcaster”. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, says that Channel 4 could be sold before 2024 to provide a “sustainable future” for the broadcaster. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport launches a consultation on the future of Channel 4, with the government supporting its privatisation. It says that this is because of the broadcasting landscape having “changed beyond recognition” since 1982. A report finds that up to 60 TV production companies could go out of business if Channel 4 is privatised. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, seems unaware of how the broadcaster is funded during a select committee appearance, saying it is “in receipt of public money”, despite it relying on advertising and commercial revenue. Senior Conservative MPs, including the former culture secretary Karen Bradley, call for ministers to halt plans to privatise the station, saying it would harm the government’s levelling up plans and be contrary to Thatcher’s founding vision. The broadcaster’s chief executive, Alex Mahon, emails staff saying that she has been informed that the government will announce the proposal to privatise Channel 4.",News/Media,Channel 4: the 40-year countdown to privatisation,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/04/channel-4-the-40-year-countdown-to-privatisation
4/5/2022,"‘Miaow,” says Robert Maxwell. “Miaow,” replies Ghislaine. “Miaow,” says daddy. “Miaow,” says daughter. Maxwell’s longsuffering secretary, Carol Bragoli, typing nearby, hears both sides of this conversation as Robert, being a master of the universe, always had his phone on loudspeaker so lickspittles could savour every blah. The miaowing went on for minutes and, so far as I could tell, Bragoli didn’t have a sick bucket. It’s almost impossible not to see this vignette through the prism of Succession, with Ghislaine as a precursor of Siobhan Roy, decorous daughter with no evident business skills, swanning around as though she owns the place and yearning for daddy’s validation; while daddy, when not peeing from the top-floor office of his lamestream media business on to the peasants below, barks at jellyfish underlings in his wake. There are differences. Logan Roy never had Rupert Murdoch as his nemesis, nor did he have himself memorialised vaingloriously in stained glass as Samson bringing down the walls of Gaza in the 51-bedroom mansion he rented from the council. Nor did he arrive in Britain as a refugee in 1940, work for the KGB and MI5, and serve as a Labour MP before amassing a multimillion-pound fortune. Most of all, Roy didn’t have a favourite child; still less did he name his mid-life crisis yacht after his daughter. The opening episode of The House of Maxwell (BBC Two) tacks efficiently between the night in November 1991, in waters off the Canary Islands, when Maxwell was seen alive for the last time on the Lady Ghislaine, and various key moments in his career. This documentary doesn’t test Ghislaine’s theory that her father was murdered, but rather assumes that Robert, disgrace closing in, slipped overboard, avoiding the shame of being found out to be, not a latter-day Samson, but a thief whose leveraged business empire was about to crumble. Maxwell House was once an unspeakable instant coffee in the UK; now the house of Maxwell is an unspeakable if more successful brand, whose every cough, spit and miaow is to be plundered in the way Robert did with the Mirror Group pension fund. I’m not sure this series adds much to the story set out in John Sweeney’s excellent podcast, Hunting Ghislaine, other than audio recordings of panicked lackeys wondering what will happen when their master’s body is recovered. But its confident retelling of the grisly family saga makes one wonder if daddy’s example showed his children that morality is for little people. Certainly, the tale told here of how Maxwell stymied publication of Tom Bower’s disobliging biography, which dared to depict Maxwell as a black marketeer profiting from shortages in postwar Berlin, suggests how ruthless in protecting the gilded lie Ghislaine’s father was. The series takes us from the Carpathian shtetl, in Ukraine, where Robert was born in 1923 to the Brooklyn detention centre in early 2022, where Ghislaine awaits sentencing for sex trafficking underage girls for her former boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein, and for others devoid of moral sense – although not Prince Andrew. Heavens, no. Eve Pollard intriguingly suggests one reason Maxwell appointed her as the Sunday Mirror’s first female editor: not out of any feminist conviction, but because she was, by definition, no threat to his dreary view of life as a competition between men. At only one moment in this opening episode does Robert Maxwell resemble a human being. Documentary film-maker Ray Errol Fox recalls interviewing Maxwell at the Yad Vashem memorial to victims of the Holocaust in Jerusalem. Maxwell spotted the name of his birthplace, Solotvina, on a wall memorialising places whose Jewish populations were murdered by the Nazis. Years before his death, Maxwell told Fox, he returned to Solotvina with his wife, Betty. “Not a single Jew was left,” Robert told Fox, as he welled up. “It was as if we never existed.” Did his epiphany in Jerusalem prompt Maxwell to take his own life? That may seem a stretch, but Fox certainly thought it significant that Maxwell was not seen in public again after attending the New York premiere of his film. Perhaps seeing himself on screen, for once shorn of pomp and sobbing with genuine emotion, made Maxwell realise that the way he had led his life was shameful. It remains a tantalising suggestion, but the likelihood of Maxwell being unable to bear being exposed as a thief and a fraud is surely the decisive factor in explaining his death. The key moments of Maxwell’s rise and fall seem inconceivable today. No oligarch now follows his business model of buying up newspapers from London to New York to Jerusalem. The establishment doesn’t ritually abase itself before moneyed moguls, as it did at Maxwell’s 65th birthday party, held at his rented mansion. Or maybe I’m being naive. The ennoblement of the oligarch press baron Evgeny Lebedev by grateful Conservative grandees suggests that the spirit of Maxwell lives on.",Arts/Television & radio,House of Maxwell review – there is only one moment where Robert resembles a human being,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/04/house-of-maxwell-review-there-is-only-one-moment-where-robert-resembles-a-human-being
4/5/2022,"Good morning. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report has highlighted the urgent but achievable actions needed to avoid catastrophic consequences of global heating, in what is in effect a final warning for governments on the climate. The report’s release comes as residents of northern NSW continue to salvage homes and businesses in the wake of repeat floods. Thirty months is the very short time the world now has for global greenhouse gas emissions to finally start to fall or face the worst impacts of the climate crisis. The report from the IPCC says the world can still hope to stave off the worst ravages of climate breakdown but only through a “now or never” dash to a low-carbon economy and society. But currently, the failure to make the changes needed will result in temperatures soaring past 3C. “The implication for Australia is clear: we need to overcome the current situation where there is merely a patchwork of mostly half-hearted policies, and absence of any policy for many aspects of the economy,” writes Frank Jotzo. Here are the key takeaways from the panel’s third report. Joe Biden has called for Vladimir Putin to be tried for war crimes and said he would seek more sanctions after Russian forces were accused of a “massacre” in Bucha where the bodies of unarmed Ukrainian civilians and mass graves were found on Sunday. EU leaders have denounced “massacres”, “atrocities” and “possible genocide” as the Kremlin flatly rejected all responsibility. Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited Bucha on Monday where the Ukrainian leader said it had become harder for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia since ​Kyiv had become aware of the scale of alleged atrocities carried out by Russian troops. NSW Liberal MP Catherine Cusack has added her voice to a growing chorus of critics of Scott Morrison from within his own party in a scathing opinion piece for Guardian Australia. Cusack, who announced two weeks ago she would resign from the Legislative Council over her anger about flood relief, accused the prime minister of “self-serving ruthless bullying” and claims he has “ruined” the Liberal party. Cusack said Morrison had “trashed” the party’s values over two decades, as state director, “then as a scheming MP and now as prime minister finding loopholes in our constitution to delay preselections in order to get his way”. And only a quarter of Guardian Essential respondents think the Morrison government’s cash splash budget is good for them personally, and just over half (56%) think the budget’s primary purpose is to help the Coalition win the coming election. The tiny population of Victoria’s lowland Leadbeater’s possum – 33 to be exact – could face extinction within decades if translocation efforts do not succeed, after land clearing, logging and bushfires decimated the possum’s habitat of mountain ash swamps. Liberal senator Eric Abetz justified billing taxpayers $2,000 to travel to a lavish farewell gala dinner for Tony Abbott by saying the former prime minister implemented “pro-Tasmania” policies, making his attendance relevant to his home state. Hundreds of thousands of fish have died in NSW after flooding caused “severe deoxygenation” of rivers. Researchers were alarmed to discover carcasses of species that traditionally tolerate lower oxygen levels. The aged care sector has called on the major parties to spell out exactly how they plan to fund the sector to make it sustainable against the backdrop of an ageing Australian population, claiming current rules would see the pay of nursing home staff go backwards. Vladimir Putin has congratulated Viktor Orbán on his victory in Hungary’s general election, but the European Union may launch a sanctions that could switch off billions in EU payments to Budapest due to democratic backsliding. Billionaire Elon Musk bought a 9.2% stake in Twitter for almost $3bn to become the social media platform’s largest shareholder. The company’s shares soared by more than a quarter in pre-market trading on the back of the news. Pakistan remains without a government after the supreme court delayed its verdict on whether the prime minister, Imran Khan, had violated the constitution by dissolving parliament rather than face a no-confidence vote. Since forming in 1991, Australian children’s group the Wiggles have pretty much seen it all. After topping the Hottest 100 this year, the group have now topped the album charts, with a record that proves their multigenerational appeal. Murray Cook, a pre-pandemic regular on the live scene, is tickled by the validation from younger musicians. “I find it particularly satisfying that so many people I meet tell me that the Wiggles were their entrée to music. To me that’s, like, mission accomplished.” Australian standards say care labels must provide instructions adequate enough to prevent clothes from being damaged if they are followed correctly. But garment care labels can sometimes be overly cautious. So what are the rules of thumb to tell if a you can hand wash a “dry clean only” garment? Experts say you need to pay attention to the texture, treat lined clothes with caution, and keep and eye on the dye. New month – new music!

4/5/2022,"Those seeking a quiet life, tired of the price and pace of Kyiv, once came to live on Vokzal’na Street in the small town of Bucha, 17 miles north-west of Ukraine’s capital. It was known as “little Switzerland”, so comfortable was the living. Today, Vokzal’na is burned out, its broken homes and the churned-up military hardware littering the muddy quagmire of what was the road make up some of the defining images of the devastation wrought by Vladimir Putin’s war. It is barely conceivable that anyone could have survived what was thrown at Vokzal’na from both sides during what was clearly a vicious battle on the road to Kyiv. There is not a brick unscathed nor a patch of mud that will not have been mixed with blood. But, now that the Russians have gone, Vokzal’na’s residents are emerging from their cellars, tired, tearful and angry. Serhiy Savenko, 43, who lives with his mother, Larisa, 72, at No 35, had counted the Russian armoured vehicles as they had rolled past at 9.10am on 27 February, heading south towards the neighbouring town of Irpin and on towards the capital. “There was 70 of the armoured vehicles, like tanks, and Russian soldiers walked alongside,” he said. “It took about 40 minutes for them to pass our house. I watched and counted. And then the Ukrainians launched their shells at the Russians.” The first took out Savenko’s shed in his large garden at the back. It was the first of many. The horribly exposed armoured vehicles tried to turn around, in panic, as the next more accurate wave of shells rained down upon them. Thirty minutes of devastation ensued. Russian bodies were strewn across the road, hot metal flew through the air, smashing every window, enveloping the trees in fire, and turning the burning vehicles white hot. Across Savenko’s 30-metre hedge alone, nine devastated armoured vehicles were left burnt out, filling the air with the acrid smell of burning oil and metal. Those Russians that could escape did. But an hour after the Ukrainian assault, the Russians came back to retrieve their dead – and to entrench themselves in Vokzal’na’s gardens and what was left of its buildings, establishing points from which to send their artillery fire at the Ukrainian defenders. It would be a long and cruel occupation. “We were in our cellar the whole time,” Savenko said. “The Russians set up their weapons and a fire in the front garden. One came down to the cellar and saw us. He said to be quiet. He said he was a nice guy but his colleagues would get us on our knees and shoot us. They took our phones and said, no fires, as if we could make some sort of signal.” Standing outside her home at No 31, gripping a note, with tears streaming down her face, Zinaida, 62, had been in her cellar since 5 March. On Sunday, the Ukrainian army found the body of her son-in-law just around the corner. She was just about tell her daughter and 16-year-old grandson who had been evacuated and until now only knew that he was missing. There isn’t any internet connection in Bucha, typical of all the towns that Russia has targeted in its special military operation. “My daughter asked him to leave their basement to pick some things up from a neighbour’s house. Here is her note, he had it with him: cigarettes on the shelf near the sofa, pills, groceries, slippers, a blanket. He left the house on 4 March. He walked just 20 metres from the house and the Russians killed him. No warning, no reason. He was such a good father, his son loved him so much. He is disabled. How can I tell them?” On the same side of the road at No 27, a new-build block of apartments, Ivan, 55, and Helen, 50, who did not want to give their surnames, were cleaning up the glass, shell fragments and unexploded armaments outside on the communal porch. It was something they had done throughout the ordeal. They had only moved in three months earlier. Of the eight families that had lived here, they were the only ones to stay having nowhere else to go. “We tidied all the time, swept up. We don’t have a basement anyway. We wanted to show we were not scared, I don’t know,” said Ivan. “But you see that high apartment block over there? Well there was a sniper and he was angry that we weren’t scared and cowering. So he fired shots over our head.” On the floor of his neighbour’s apartment, among the glass, and metal, was blood, as there was on the kitchen table, still wet. It was the blood of Russian soldiers who had been hiding inside, evidenced by the discarded food wrappings. Across the road at No 32 there is nothing left other than the remnants of some walls. Next door, a frame of what was a garage. Volodymr Matsyk, 62, and his wife, Lydmyla, and their two sons, Artem, 33, and Bodgan, 20, stayed underground in the cellar as their world above was blown away. They have been evacuated. But neighbour, Dymytro Zamogylny, 56, said an injured Russian soldier who had been taken there to receive medical assistance had not been so fortunate. “A bomb landed right on the house killing him,” he said. At No 23, Oleksandr Loza, 87, had been found laid out on the ground in his pyjamas, unable to move, after the initial fighting of 27 February. He has since been evacuated. The nextdoor neighbours’ handsome green roof at No 25 was caved in by a direct hit. Its owners, cowering in the cellar, Oleksandr, 66, and Galayno, 65, who had been the chief carers to their elderly friend next door, miraculously escaped with their lives. Bucha is a blackened, hollowed out mess. Bodies of civilians continue to be discovered. On Monday, officials took away five bodies of men seemingly tied up and shot by the Russians in the basement of a summer residence for children. It was also claimed that human remains found near the town were Olga Sukhenk, the mayor of Motyzhyn, and her husband and son. Visiting the town on Monday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spoke on national television about what he had seen. “These are war crimes and will be recognised by the world as genocide,” he said, wearing body armour and surrounded by military personnel. “We know of thousands of people killed and tortured, with severed limbs, raped women and murdered children.” Around the corner from Vokzal’na Street, close to where 21 civilians were found scattered across one of Bucha’s main roads on Saturday, Sergiy Zebenko, 57, and his wife, Helen, 49, showed the grave of their cousin, Dmytro Bernastsky, 59, in their garden. “We found his body on 31 March just 150 metres from us and buried him here,” said Helen. “But we don’t even know when he was killed, maybe 10 days earlier when he was coming to see us. He had three bullets in his left leg, one to his heart and one to his lung. He was by the supermarket. We want to rebury him. He was a pilot in the Ukrainian air force. We want to bury him in his uniform, it needs to happen.

4/5/2022,"The industry player most likely to buy Channel 4, with the least regulatory hurdles, is Discovery. The big US pay-TV company, which is merging with WarnerMedia, the parent company of CNN, HBO and the Hollywood studio behind the Batman and Harry Potter franchises, expressed interest the last time the broadcaster faced privatisation in 2016. The company, which has a mix of free and pay-TV operations, continues to be highly active in the UK market, striking a deal with BT in February to launch a pay-TV sports joint venture including BT Sport, which has rights to sports including football’s Premier League and Champions League. However, ITV has been lobbying Whitehall about the possibility of a “national champion” takeover, designed to take the political fallout of yet another buyout of a UK “crown jewel” by a foreign owner. The issue for ITV, which said in the 00s that it would bid for Channel 4 if it was combined with another broadcaster as was mooted with Channel 5, is that it would create what amounts to a TV advertising monopoly resulting in significant competition issues. There will also be significant interest from private equity buyers, although Channel 4’s remit would have to be changed to allow a non-trade buyer to make profits from the business. Channel 4’s remit has never been to make a profit – the money it makes is reinvested in commissioning and buying programmes from mostly British TV production companies, helping to support a key national industry. Analysts believe that a privatised Channel 4 would face 40% to 50% cuts to its £660m programming budget – spent on content such as news and current affairs, Gogglebox and It’s a Sin – to force its model into that of a commercially-focused broadcaster. This is likely to mean cuts to content that does not bring in much income from advertising, which Channel 4 relies on for more than 90% of its £1bn annual revenues, such as news. Channel 4 is a key commissioner of TV content from production companies based around the UK and sees itself as a key part of the government’s levelling up ambitions outside London. Analysts believe that as many 60 TV production companies around the UK could be forced to shut if Channel 4 moved to private ownership. Channel 4 was established by Margaret Thatcher’s government in 1982 to provide a culturally challenging alternative to BBC One, BBC Two and ITV. It is publicly owned but commercially funded. Unlike the BBC, which is funded through the £159-a-year licence fee its viewers must pay, Channel 4 has no financial support from the taxpayer. While a price tag of £1bn was attached to the broadcaster at the last privatisation push, it is very difficult to provide a current estimate. Unlike rivals such as ITV and the BBC, Channel 4’s remit means it does not have its own in-house production arm. While it has rights to show programmes on linear TV and on its streaming services in the UK, the broadcaster does not own the rights to commercialise those shows around the world. The ownership of must-watch, “crown jewel” content has been the driver of the wave of media mergers and takeovers seen in recent years. Any potential buyer would need Channel 4’s model to be allowed to be drastically changed to increase margins and commercial opportunities. Privatisation in some form has been mooted about half a dozen times since Channel 4’s launch, with the most serious push coming under David Cameron’s government in 2016. That was led by the then culture secretary John Whittingdale, who is also overseeing the government’s latest push towards privatisation. Ultimately, it was decided that the benefits of a cash windfall to the government were outweighed by the scale of the detrimental impact on the independent TV sector. In 2017, the culture secretary Karen Bradley formally ruled privatisation out, saying Channel 4 was a “precious public asset” that would “continue to be owned by the country”. Instead, the government pushed for Channel 4 to relocate significant parts of its operations and staff out of London. About 300 of its 800 staff have now moved to new “national” headquarters in Leeds, as well as “creative hubs” in Bristol and Glasgow.",News/Media,What you need to know about the privatisation of Channel 4,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/04/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-privatisation-of-channel-4
4/5/2022,"The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, is pushing ahead with controversial plans to privatise Channel 4, with the government backing proposals to sell off the broadcaster after 40 years in public ownership. The government hopes to raise around £1bn from the sell-off, making it one of the biggest privatisations since Royal Mail went public a decade ago. Ministers have suggested they could spend the proceeds to boost creative training and independent production companies, essentially funding their levelling up agenda. The plans had met fierce reaction from the media industry, with prominent broadcasters such as Sir David Attenborough suggesting the government was pursuing an agenda of “shortsighted political and financial attacks” on British public service broadcasters. Channel 4’s chief executive, Alex Mahon, told staff of the news in an email on Monday night, saying: “We have been informed in the last hour that the government will shortly announce that the secretary of state has decided to proceed with the proposal to privatise Channel 4. “In our engagement with the government during its extended period of reflection, we have proposed a vision for the next 40 years which we are confident would allow us to build on the successes of the first 40. That vision was rooted in continued public ownership and was built upon the huge amount of public value this model has delivered to date and the opportunity to deliver so much more in the future.” Mahon hinted that the current leadership of Channel 4 would not go down without a fight, suggesting that “ultimately the ownership of Channel 4 is for government to propose and parliament to decide” and the lengthy process of passing legislation to privatise the channel meant it was not a done deal. On Monday evening Dorries tweeted that public ownership was “holding Channel 4 back from competing against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon”. She added: “A change of ownership will give Channel 4 the tools and freedom to flourish and thrive as a public service broadcaster long into the future.” The shadow culture secretary, Lucy Powell, described the move as “cultural vandalism”. She said: “Selling off Channel 4, which doesn’t cost the tax-payer a penny anyway, to what is likely to be a foreign company, is cultural vandalism. It will cost jobs and opportunities in the north and Yorkshire, and hit the wider British creative economy.” The channel is run on a commercial basis and carries adverts but reinvests all of its profits into making new programmes. Its current leadership has argued that a new private sector owner would instead seek to maximise profits at the expense of original and distinctively British programming. Last year Dorries wrongly claimed in parliament that Channel 4 was in “receipt of public money”. In reality the channel operates without any public subsidy but it has the ability to access emergency borrowing from the state. Despite this, the government has argued Channel 4 is too small to survive in the long term when competing against global streaming companies for programmes. Although it has grown the audience for its own All 4 catchup service, the broadcaster is heavily reliant on the traditional income that comes from selling advertising on live broadcasts. Potential buyers for the broadcaster could include a streaming service, another British commercial broadcaster such as ITV, or a US media company such as Discovery – although they could all be put off by the need to meet public service requirements such as providing expensive current affairs programming. Dorries’ decision comes days after the government, in consultation with Ofcom, appointed the businessman Sir Ian Cheshire as the chair of Channel 4 with an eye on privatisation. Michael Grade, the newly installed chair of Ofcom and a former chief executive of Channel 4, is also a supporter of privatisation – potentially making it easier to clear any regulatory concerns. The announcement comes shortly after Dorries announced another real-terms reduction in the BBC licence fee, which will result in further cuts to its budget. Although the government would be likely to be able to pass the legislation required to privatise Channel 4 through the Commons, it could struggle in the Lords. There had been speculation in recent weeks that the prospect of a tough battle to pass the relevant law would cause the government to abandon the privatisation plans as it prepares the ground for a general election due in the next two years. Instead, it appears to be betting it can push through the sell-off at speed. Proposals to privatise Channel 4 have been made regularly during its existence but until now the broadcaster has always successfully retained its independence. The latest sell-off proposals were made in the wake of the Conservatives’ 2019 election campaign, when the broadcaster’s news arm angered the governing party by replacing Boris Johnson with a melting block of ice during a debate about climate change. Channel 4’s former head of current affairs Dorothy Byrne also alienated Downing Street when she described the prime minister as “a known liar” and compared him to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in a speech to the media industry – views that are rarely publicly expressed by sitting senior news executives. A formal consultation on whether to privatise Channel 4 was launched last year and attracted more than 60,000 submissions, with independent television production companies putting up a particularly fierce opposition. They argued ministers should be celebrating Channel 4 as a creation of Margaret Thatcher’s government which helped turn the UK into one of the biggest global centres for media production. A Channel 4 spokesperson said the government’s announcement on Monday had been “made without formally recognising the significant public interest concerns which have been raised” during the consultation process. “Channel 4 has engaged in good faith with the government throughout the consultation process … Recently, Channel 4 presented DCMS [the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport] with a real alternative to privatisation that would safeguard its future financial stability, allowing it to do significantly more for the British public, the creative industries and the economy, particularly outside London. “Channel 4 remains legally committed to its unique public-service remit. The focus for the organisation will be on how we can ensure we deliver the remit to both our viewers and the British creative economy across the whole of the UK. “The proposal to privatise Channel 4 will require a lengthy legislative process and political debate. We will of course continue to engage with DCMS, government and parliament and do everything we can to ensure that Channel 4 continues to play its unique part in Britain’s creative ecology and national life.”",News/Media,Nadine Dorries presses ahead with plan to privatise Channel 4,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/04/nadine-dorries-to-press-ahead-with-plan-to-privatise-channel-4
4/5/2022,"Unions representing parliamentary staff have called for MPs accused of sexual misconduct to be excluded from the Westminster estate while investigations take place, after allegations against the Conservative backbencher David Warburton. The joint call by unions representing parliamentary workers – Prospect, the FDA, the Public and Commercial Services Union and the GMB – comes after Warburton was accused of sexual harassment as well as alleged cocaine use and potentially failing to declare a loan. The MP for Somerton and Frome has denied any wrongdoing, and has been taken to a psychiatric hospital. He has lost the Tory whip and is expected to face a series of investigations over the claims. In a statement, the unions said they had written to Karen Bradley, who chairs the cross-party Commons procedure committee that examines the working practices of the Commons. They have asked Bradley to look at whether it might be practicable to introduce a rule meaning anyone being investigated over sexual misconduct is kept away from the parliamentary estate during any investigations. The idea was also proposed in a report by the Commons women and equalities committee into helping to create a more gender-sensitive parliament. Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of Prospect, said such a measure was long overdue: “We are again in the situation where an MP, accused of a serious offence, is technically free to come and go as he pleases. This is a ridiculous oversight that will leave people questioning parliament’s commitment to keeping its staff safe.” Bradley should act to “bring parliament into the 21st century as an employer,” Graham said. “In no other workplace would someone subject to such serious allegations receive only a voluntary ban.” The allegations of misconduct, made by three women according to the Sunday Times, would be investigated by parliament’s independent complaints and grievance scheme, which does not comment on ongoing cases. Warburton could also be investigated by the parliamentary commissioner for standards over a loan he received in 2017 of close to £150,000 for a holiday rental property, if this was not properly registered. The loan, which has now been repaid, was provided by Roman Joukovski, a financial adviser who specialised in offshore tax advice and providing tier one “golden” investor visas. Finally, Warburton could face an inquiry by police after media reports about the claims included a photograph of him with lines of a white powder, allegedly reported to be cocaine. The Sunday Times said two former aides to Warburton had made complaints about him, and that the fact he employs his wife, Harriet, whose role includes human resources issues, made it harder for them to take action. A cabinet minister defended the working practice of MPs employing relatives, which was banned for new MPs from 2017, saying it was “really productive”. Simon Hart, the Wales secretary, who employs his wife, told Times Radio he was a “staunch defender” of the idea. “I think that’s actually pretty insulting towards so many husbands wives and partners who do a really good job in parliament, work bloody hard, and provide the taxpayer real value for money,” he said.",News/Politics,Unions call for Westminster ban for MPs accused of sexual misconduct ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/04/unions-call-for-westminster-ban-for-mps-accused-of-sexual-misconduct
4/5/2022,"Bird populations in a Central American tropical rainforest are suffering severe declines, with likely factors including climate breakdown and habitat loss. Scientists from the University of Illinois tracked species of birds in a protected forest reserve in central Panama to determine if and how populations had changed from 1977 to 2020. There are very few long-term studies on population trends for tropical birds, and the report provides insights into how species are coping with habitat loss and the climate crisis. A new study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that the majority of sampled species had declined in abundance, many of them severely. Twice a year over four decades, the authors deployed mist nets in multiple study sites, identifying and banding thousands of birds. Next, the authors modelled populations and estimated changes in the abundance of 57 species. Of the declining species sampled, 35 out of 40 lost more than 50% of their initial abundance. Only two species increased in numbers. The declines extended across different bird families and were generally independent of ecological traits such as body mass, foraging type, or the species’ initial abundance. According to the authors, establishing declines and identifying the underlying ecological mechanisms should be a conservation priority. The scientists said human activity was likely to be driving the drops in numbers, with changing rainfall patterns, increasing temperatures and deforestation causing stress to bird populations. They said: “Deforestation in the humid tropics accelerated 62% between 1990 and 2010, resulting in a net loss of about 8m hectares (20m acres) during this time period, and losses have continued to accrue in recent years. “Increasing temperatures are driving upslope range shifts of lowland tropical species across [taxonomic groups] and both theoretical and empirical evidence indicate that tropical biotas are more strongly affected than their temperate counterparts. Changing rainfall regimes in the tropics are also expected to strongly impact species’ distributions and population dynamics.” Another factor in the decline could be the indirect impact of the climate emergency. The insects the birds feed on are sensitive to changing temperature and rainfall, and droughts as well as irregular rainfall can affect the seasonal availability of fruit and nectar. There are also concerns the change in climate could be benefiting parasites that weaken the birds. The scientists said the losses were “alarming”, with a range of species affected, including the red-capped manakin, the most abundant fruit-eating bird sampled and an important seed disperser. In 1977, 23 were spotted, but in 2020, just nine were captured. Researchers said that though tropical forests are often thought to be “reservoirs of biodiversity”, this study suggests there are worrying declines in species populations. They concluded more studies are needed, writing: “The next logical step toward understanding and possibly preventing further declines is identifying the underlying ecological mechanisms. To accomplish this, intensive, long-term studies of individual species will likely be needed to drill down to the factors.”",News/Environment,"Bird populations in Panama rainforest in severe decline, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/04/bird-populations-in-panama-rainforest-in-severe-decline-study-finds
4/5/2022,"Sometimes a war crime is so egregious, and so fully reported, that it cannot but stir the conscience of the west. The My Lai massacre in 1968, Srebrenica in 1995, the British suppression of the Mau Mau rebellion in Kenya, the Rwanda genocide of 1994, the Disappeared of Argentina under the junta in the 1980s or even the dispatches about bodies piled high in Bulgarian town squares by the US war reporter Januarius MacGahan in 1876 were all moments when the defence of ignorance has to be abandoned. Even then the truth is more complicated and the west did not always act. Bill Clinton regretted he did not respond to the murders of Tutsis in 1994, saying he did not “fully appreciate the depth and the speed with which [Rwandans] were being engulfed by this unimaginable terror”. Srebrenica was arguably only the culmination of ethnic cleansing that had been going on for three years. My Lai, revealed two years after the event, only provided further momentum to a pre-existing US anti-war movement. The scale of the British repression of the Mau Mau rebellion was only truly documented decades afterwards by a Harvard historian Caroline Elkins in her book Britain’s Gulag. So it is not a foregone conclusion that the pictures of Ukrainian civilians murdered with their hands tied will lead to towns such as Bucha becoming a spur for action when Nato and G7 ministers meet this week in Belgium. Measures such as suspension of Russia from the UN human rights council may have some symbolic value, but the big test is further European economic sanctions that may not just hit Russia but also the EU. Russia is clearly nervous, drawing upon its Syrian playbook to claim the bodies strewn in the streets were part of an inside job staged by Ukrainian defence forces for consumption by gullible western reporters. Russia’s deputy ambassador to the UN Dmitry Polyansky claimed: “Today’s Ukrainian neo-Nazis are fully respecting the old Goebbels Nazi provocation school and trying to shift the blame on Russia.” On the basis that attack is the best form of defence, Moscow tried to call for an emergency meeting of the UN security council on Monday, but met resistance from the UK, the current president of the council. Russia’s diplomatic activity is less designed to sow doubt among westerners than to keep hold of the neutrals, such as China, India, Israel and even Turkey. It is also an act of political self-preservation. Studies of decades of Serbian denials of Srebrenica suggest no self-doubt can be countenanced. For Volodymyr Zelenskiy, by contrast, this has to be a turning point, the moment to create a convulsion in Europe, and finally to pile so much pressure on Germany that it stops being the drag anchor of Europe about sanctions. From Ukraine’s perspective, if Germany shifts, the other countries also hesitating about tougher sanctions, such as Austria and Italy, would fall into line. Italy suggested as much. For Zelenskiy, a European embargo on Russian energy, even if it were initially only oil, cannot come soon enough. Latest estimates suggest Russia will earn up to $320bn from oil and gas exports until the end of 2022, which is a third more than a year earlier. The Russian rouble rose on Monday, reversing earlier losses, and the Moex benchmark stock index climbed to levels last seen before Russia sent thousands of troops into Ukraine. These are not the signs of an economy close to collapse. In an opening salvo, Zelenskiy invited the two architects of the now defunct 2014-15 Minsk peace process – Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy – to come to Bucha to see how the road to appeasement turns into this horrific cul-de-sac. His ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, has also stepped up his weeks-long assault on Russia’s friends in Germany. He said in one interview: “You see these atrocities and you are still not ready to do anything to make Putin lose his appetite for these atrocities. How can you sleep if you find strong words after these pictures, but do nothing? What else should happen so that the toughest sanctions are put on the table? Chemical attacks, or what is it you are waiting for?” Many say his unflinching criticism of Germany – his latest broadside was to claim there was a web of Russophile contacts around the German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier – is ultimately counterproductive. But Melnyk cannot stop himself from naming those he regards as the guilty men. In Tagesspiegel, for instance, he named people connected to Steinmeier such as Jens Plötner, the foreign policy adviser to Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and the state secretary in the ministry of foreign affairs, Andreas Michaelis (the former German ambassador to the UK). He claimed many important ambassadors also shared Steinmeier’s closeness to Russia. Looking at the front pages of the German press documenting Putin’s war crimes, and many German opinion polls, the ambassador clearly feels the political class is behind the public in what Germany and its economy is willing to sacrifice. Steinmeier has himself now issued a mea culpa, saying: “We clung to bridges that Russia no longer believed in and that our partners warned us about. My assessment was that Vladimir Putin would not accept the complete economic, political and moral ruin of his country for his imperial madness. Like others I was wrong.” But the roadblock is no longer that there is anyone in Germany willing to defend the country’s 20-year conscious decision to make itself dependent on cheap Russian energy. That may have been an orthodoxy a year ago during the debates about Nord Stream 2, but now has become heresy. The Free Democratic party vice-chair Johannes Vogel wants the Bundestag to conduct an inquiry to analyse how and why such a “misguided” and “naive” Russia policy could have been pursued by previous governments. The chair of the Greens in the Bundestag, Britta Hasselmann, also blames the “failed energy policy” under Merkel and Gerhard Schröder. Even Patrick Pouyanné, the chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies admits that Germany’s addiction to cheap Russian gas had “yes, sort of created this monster”. But the blame game about past misreadings of Putin is less important than what Germany is prepared to do now. So far, Berlin has persistently resisted the exclusion of Russian banks from the international payment system as well a temporary ban on imports of Russian oil and gas. Pouyanné says it will take four to five years to end Europe’s dependence on Russian gas. Scholz, due in the UK later this week, insists Germany will back further sanctions in response to the war crimes, but other ministers insist this cannot include a total energy ban. A full embargo will end up damaging Germany more than Russia, Scholz argues, and he has rounded on a team of economic modellers for irresponsibly claiming a full embargo would lead only to a 3% fall in German GDP. In taking up this position Scholz has the backing of Germany industry and finance. The chief executive of Deutsche Bank, Christian Sewing, was the latest to warn about the consequences if Russian energy supplies were cut off. Already grappling with soaring inflation, Sewing said Germany would face “a further deterioration of the situation” if imports or deliveries of Russian oil and natural gas were stopped. “A clear recession in Germany would presumably be inevitable.” The chief executive of the chemical group BASF, Martin Brudermüller, pointed out that Russia provided 55% of German natural gas consumed, and 35% of its oil. “Do we want to destroy our entire economy with our eyes wide open?” That view is reluctantly echoed by the economic affairs minister, Robert Habeck, who warns that an immediate import ban would lead to “supply bottlenecks next winter, economic slumps, high inflation and hundreds of thousands of people losing their jobs”. The best he could offer was independence from Russian coal by the autumn and near independence from oil by the end of the year. He could set no date for gas. The danger is the debate in Germany is becoming very polarised and entrenched. Ben Moll, an LSE professor and the informal head of the group that produced the modelling, is now suggesting a compromise: an embargo on oil and a tax on gas, with measures to cushion the blow for the poorest. Virtually anything, he says, is better than Germany’s lack of response.",News/World news,The bodies of Bucha have set a difficult test for the west,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/the-bodies-of-bucha-have-set-a-difficult-test-for-the-west-ukraine
4/5/2022,"The West must not lift sanctions against Russia until all its troops have left Ukraine and Vladimir Putin is unable to mount such an offensive again, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said. She was speaking alongside the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in Warsaw, where the two discussed how to step up sanctions against Russia to the maximum in the wake of the alleged war crimes revealed in Bucha. She said: “There should be no talk of removing sanctions, while Putin’s troops are in Ukraine, and the threat of Russian aggression looms over Europe. We need to see Putin withdraw his troops. We need to see Ukraine’s full territorial integrity restored. We need to see Russia’s ability for further aggression stopped.” She said the sanctions had already set back Russia’s economy by 15 years, but now it was necessary to go to the maximum level of sanctions since the worst in terms of atrocities had already happened. She said she believed Vladimir Putin only responded to force, adding the UK intends to press for a timetable to end western dependency on Russian energy to be agreed at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers to be attended by Germany and Italy, two of the countries most dependent on Russian energy. Kuleba urged any foreign minister thinking of voting against such an embargo to come first to visit the mass graves in Ukraine, adding half measures are no longer enough. He said he feared the bodies discovered in Bucha were just the tip of the iceberg and worse horrors will be uncovered when the siege of Mariupol is lifted. “I can tell you without an exaggeration, but with great sorrow, that the situation in Mariupol is much worse compared to what we’ve seen in Bucha and others cities, towns and villages near Kyiv,” he said. At a press conference after their meeting Truss announced an extra £10m in UK funding to help victims of sexual violence in the conflict, as well as technical advice including from the Metropolitan police to help Ukraine gather evidence of war crimes. She said: “I am afraid it is not the end of the atrocities, and we should simply not be doing business with Putin. “We have seen butchery, evidence of rape and sexual violence, as well as the indiscriminate killing of civilians. We will ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice for these barbaric crimes. And, together with our allies, we will step up our efforts to stop Putin’s appalling war.” Although she said it is very clear that war crimes have taken place, she said it was for the courts to decide if this amounted to genocide, the claim already made by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Both ministers joined the US call for Russia to be expelled from the UN Human Rights Council. Calling for a tough new wave of sanctions, Truss said: “The reality is that money is still flowing from the west into Putin’s war machine. That has to stop.” She called for a ban on Russian ships in European ports, closure of Russian banks’ access to international payment systems, a clampdown on Russian gold sales by the Russian central bank as well as the timetable to end dependency on Russian energy.",News/World news,"Sanctions on Russia must stay till all troops leave Ukraine, says Liz Truss",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/sanctions-on-russia-must-stay-till-all-troops-leave-ukraine-says-liz-truss

The 23-year-old from Ilford bought the “gummies” via a messaging app on her phone and they were delivered to her home in Ilford on 29 March, the Metropolitan police said. The sweets came in packaging branded “Trrlli Peachie O’s”. The woman and her 21-year-old friend ate one each and immediately became ill. Paramedics were called to the house on the same night, and the two women were taken to hospital. Despite treatment the 23-year-old, who has not yet been named, died on 2 April. A postmortem is still to take place. Her friend has been discharged from hospital. Leon Brown, 37, from Croydon, has been charged with possession with intent to supply a class B synthetic cannabidoid, being concerned in the supply of a synthetic cannabinoid and possession with intent to supply a psychoactive substance. He was arrested on Friday in connection with the death. Scotland Yard said he was found in possession of a large quantity of money and what were believed to be edible cannabis products. He was to appear at Barkingside magistrates court on Monday. Some of the sweets have been recovered and are now being tested. Officers believe the case could be linked to another incident in March in which a woman was taken to hospital after eating a cannabis sweet in nearby Tower Hamlets. She has since been discharged, but an investigation is under way to find out whether the sweet was from the same batch involved in the Ilford death, and to examine whether there are any other similar incidents. Ch Supt Stuart Bell said: “I must warn the public against taking any illegal substances, including those packaged in the form of cannabis sweets.” He urged people to come forward with any information about people selling similar products. Parents have previously been warned about sweets laced with cannabis after they found their way into the hands of children. Two 13-year-old boys were taken to hospital in Merseyside in July last year after eating sweets, and detectives in Greater Manchester told parents to be on alert during Halloween season trick-or-treating.

4/5/2022,"Russia’s withdrawal from around Kyiv and the north and north-east of Ukraine appears more comprehensive than most onlookers had anticipated. It will be a little while before the picture becomes definitive, but Moscow’s forces are now fast retreating out of the country from the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy districts, Ukrainian regional officials say. It is impossible to describe this as anything other than a serious reverse. Such is the haste of the exit that some units are being left behind to be mopped up by the Ukrainians. Sumy, a little over 30km from the Russian border, did not fall to the invaders, while the road to Chernihiv, which was at risk of encirclement, is now open to the capital to the south-west. Kyiv too can breathe again: the month of danger has passed and the full withdrawal means that the capital is no longer in range of artillery fire – although it can still be struck by missiles from Belarus, if the Russians bloodymindedly choose to launch them. And, while it may appear that a re-invasion could happen again at any time, the reality is that unless something dramatic happens elsewhere it cannot succeed. Russia’s problem is that its forces have taken significant losses from its overoptimistic, poorly planned multi-front attack. The number killed could be anywhere from 7,000 to 15,000, with wounded typically double that, from an invasion force of about 140,000. As Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the US Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote last week, it could be that Russia has lost “about a quarter of its initial combat force”. Other estimates from western officials have suggested Russian combat effectiveness may be depleted by a fifth or a sixth, not as high perhaps but still operationally significant. The haste of the retreat acknowledges that the invaders are in many respects exhausted and need to concentrate operations, fighting street by street to take Mariupol in the south and a more conventional military campaign in the Donbas region, where Ukraine’s forces are dug in. What will happen here is less certain. Russia still has the ability and desire to attack, and its forces are pressing south of Izyum, a key strategic point, to try to envelop the Ukrainian army that faces the separatist Donetsk and Luhansk territories to the east. But it appears its forces are having less success advancing north to join up from Velyka Novosilka, 100km north of Mariupol. And after nearly seven weeks of intense fighting, it is not at all certain Russia can keep up the effort. “If Russia wants to push back Ukraine’s defenders near Donetsk and Luhansk, they will have to force them out of defensive positions Ukraine has had five more years to prepare. It will require heavy artillery support and a use of combined arms – infantry, tanks, artillery, air power – that we have not seen so far,” said Ben Barry, a land warfare specialist from the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Ukraine says some Russian forces, brought up as reinforcements, are refusing to fight. On Sunday, its general staff said two battalions of Russian forces from South Ossetia, the breakaway region of Georgia, “refused to participate in combat” in Ukraine and would return to base. Although this cannot be verified for certain, there are enough reports of desertions and poor morale to believe Russian combat effectiveness is massively reduced – against an enemy determined to fight for its homeland. Meanwhile, mercenaries from the Russian Wagner Group – whose number has been estimated at 1,000 – have been photographed in Donetsk. But these are no replacement for well-trained regular forces: Wagner forces have, for example, struggled in countries such as Mozambique, where they briefly tried to battle an insurgency in the Muslim north in 2019. Ukraine will recognise the nature of the war has changed. Its supply lines, in particular weapons from the west, have become less fraught. But despite limited counter offensives, there is no sign its forces have the capability to push back the Russian forces where they have made gains in the east and the south. Calls for jets and tanks have gone unheeded, although Australia has promised to send Bushmaster armoured personnel carriers, which will help with mobility. If Russia choses to dig in, then the military balance – which typically favours the defender on a 3-1 ratio – is reversed. If its forces can complete the bloody recapture of Mariupol, the invaders will control the south between Crimea and the occupied Donbas – and with Odesa blockaded, ensure Ukraine has no access to the sea. Ukraine has not been defeated, although it faces a fight on its hands in the Donbas. But without a change on the battlefield it may once again be partitioned de facto, against its will.",News/World news,Routing of Russian forces from Kyiv area will be hard to repeat in eastern Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/routing-of-russian-forces-from-kyiv-area-will-be-hard-to-repeat-in-eastern-ukraine
4/5/2022,"The continued heating of the planet means that this year will probably be one of this century’s coolest. As the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) makes clear, current climate pledges by governments would not keep global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels – the target promised in the 2015 Paris agreement. Instead greenhouse gas emissions are rising. During the past decade, on average annually they were at their highest levels in human history. The world is on a pathway to temperature increases of more than 3C in the coming decades. This would make large parts of the world too hot to work in. Severe harvest failures will become common. Disappearing ice caps would submerge major cities. Governments have hitherto been far too hesitant to take on vested interests and are all too ready to protect historic investments in fossil fuels. This cannot go on. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, was right to say that the world “was on a fast track to climate disaster”. Nations and corporations, he candidly said, are not just turning a blind eye to a planetary disaster but adding fuel to the flames. There is very little time left to implement policies that promote the needed greener lifestyle choices and cheaper renewable solutions that would generate jobs, energy security and price stability. To achieve 1.5C, the world must reduce annual CO2 emissions by about 50% by 2030, and reach net zero by 2050, while reducing methane emissions a third by 2030 and almost halving them by 2050. This will need deep cuts in fossil fuel use. The IPCC says the case is unanswerable for widespread electrification – especially crucial for enabling the decarbonisation of road transport, industry, mining and manufacturing – powered by renewable sources. The UN’s scientists argue that energy efficiency and conservation are central to achieving a greener, safer future. There are some success stories: at least 18 countries have sustained production-based greenhouse gas and consumption-based carbon dioxide emission reductions for longer than a decade. Much of the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere was released by rich countries that burned coal, oil and gas to industrialise more than a century ago. The UN panel said about 40% of emissions since then came from Europe and North America. Only about 12% can be attributed to east Asia, including China. It is in the wealthiest 10% of households, which contribute between a third and 45% of climate-changing fumes, where change will have to happen fastest. There are some quick policy wins. Better crop management has an immediate payback. Solar energy and wind energy improve faster and are adopted quicker than nuclear or carbon capture technologies. Diets high in plant protein and low in meat and dairy are associated with lower greenhouse gas emissions and are increasingly popular. It is likely that global temperatures will “overshoot” the 1.5C pledged by the Paris agreement. Even under one of the least bad scenarios, the IPCC says that temporarily exceeding this limit by a tiny 0.2C before dropping back down to about 1.4C by the century’s end could still unleash irreversible impacts such as dead coral reefs. The pandemic was an opportunity to make the rapid shift required away from fossil fuels and was missed by most governments. Russia’s immoral war in Ukraine offers another chance for nations concerned about overreliance on hydrocarbons to do the right thing.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the latest IPCC report: a fast track to climate disaster | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-latest-ipcc-report-a-fast-track-to-climate-disaster
4/5/2022,"What now for the European Union’s most challenged and compromised democracy? The scale of Viktor Orbán’s fourth consecutive election victory in Hungary was crushing, comprehensive and unexpected. Faced for the first time with a united opposition alliance that put internal differences aside, predictions of a close race – or at least a competitive one – were confounded. On a high turnout, Mr Orbán’s Fidesz party actually won a greater number of seats than it held previously while Péter Márki-Zay, the opposition’s candidate for prime minister, failed even to win the local constituency he was contesting. Once again, resistance to Mr Orbán’s brand of authoritarian, conservative nationalism was largely confined to Budapest and other urban centres. This is a result that will be mourned in Brussels and celebrated in the Kremlin. After pledging to keep Hungary out of the confrontation between the liberal west and Vladimir Putin’s Russia over Ukraine, Mr Orbán has a mandate to obstruct and disrupt EU attempts to impose further sanctions on Moscow. At a time when European unity is paramount, that is a problem that western leaders can do without. But at a still more fundamental level, the EU faces the acute dilemma of how to deal with a member state in which democratic norms have been flouted to such an extent that Mr Orbán’s autocratic rule appears unassailable. Mr Márki-Zay did not fight a good campaign, as the opposition alliance failed to gel. But as he pointed out in a crestfallen election night address, this was anything but a fair political fight. During the course of 12 years in power, Mr Orbán has dismantled checks and balances to the extent that a proper hearing for opposition voices is now impossible in Hungary. Brazen gerrymandering of electoral districts – and a huge disparity in campaign resources – have grotesquely skewed the political map in favour of Fidesz. In 2018 the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe described the country’s elections as “free but not fair”. Independent media have been forced out of business or taken over by government-friendly buyers, while state media barely go through the motions of presenting a balanced debate. Last month, one state television channel broadcast a 30-minute address by Mr Orbán nine times in the space of 24 hours. By contrast, Mr Márki-Zay was granted a total of five minutes’ airtime on state television during the election campaign. A corrupt clientelism, partly financed through EU funds, has made Mr Orbán’s friends and allies rich and entrenched his oppressive influence across civil society. Confronted with a member state that risks becoming a democracy in name only – and where political opposition from within faces unacceptable obstacles – pressure from without must be more robustly exerted. The EU has frozen Covid recovery fund payments to Hungary, amounting to 5% of GDP, over corruption concerns. In the absence of a genuine commitment to reform in Budapest, that money should not be forthcoming. Brussels should also make it clear to Mr Orbán that a new law tying EU funds to compliance with democratic norms will be rigorously enforced. Belatedly, it must be made clear that a substantial price will be paid for treating the basic principles of EU membership with contempt. After the polls closed, Mr Orbán exulted at a win “so big that you can see it from the moon, and you can certainly see it from Brussels”. The EU should not allow him the last word.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Hungary’s election: a dismal day for democracy | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/04/the-guardian-view-on-hungarys-election-a-dismal-day-for-democracy
4/5/2022,"If children have siblings and they’ve mixed with others, they tend to be on the same level socially as before the pandemic. But the ones who are only children and have just been in the household with mum and dad don’t know how to interact. They have issues with sharing, being very overexcited and turn-taking. They’re quite advanced in numbers and letters for their age because they’ve been at home with adults, or they’ve been playing a lot on tablets, but they are very behind socially, the empathy isn’t there.Where I work it is a fairly affluent area, there aren’t a great deal of social problems. It seems to be the slightly more middle-class children who’re socially behind. They’re more likely to be only children, have older parents, and their parents are mostly office workers so they worked from home and were more isolated. A lot of children were put on tablets. It’s not a criticism of the parents because they were forced into that situation, but you can see it in the children’s social skills. Under five, social skills are everything, it’s the marker of how they will develop more than whether they can say the alphabet or count to 10. Children with good social skills and interaction, even if they’re not the quickest at learning to read or write, often have the best educational outcomes. Parents are presenting with a higher level of anxiety about how their kids are developing. They ask “is my child normal?” Lots of parents are saying “my child is autistic” and the child clearly isn’t. They’re just presenting schematic behaviour, they line things up and do things continually, which is just how toddlers develop. We have to assure them this behaviour is normal, it’s normal for a toddler to snatch. Parents haven’t had the opportunity to talk to other parents, so they’re at home and Google something and it opens a can of worms. The parents are definitely making it worse for their children socially and for themselves. We’ve got one particular little boy, he’s four and he’s not ever mixed with children at all. The mum is extremely nervous about Covid and so over-anxious that as soon as he cries, she’ll keep him off because she thinks he’s been traumatised. He’s a completely normal boy but he’s not being given a chance because her anxiety is transferring on to him. There’s a whole bunch of children who no matter what preschool does they won’t be ready for school. In a preschool with 30 children you’ll have four or five adults; in a school you’ll have one teacher. They don’t have the time to take a child to the toilet or to make them sit still, the child has to be ready.",News/UK news,‘Empathy isn’t there’: the pandemic effects on children’s social skills,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/04/empathy-isnt-there-the-pandemic-effects-on-childrens-social-skills
4/5/2022,"The father of a 23-year-old who died after running away from a mental health hospital by jumping over a fence said staff knew patients regularly absconded. Matthew Caseby died after being struck by a train in September 2020, having run away from the Priory hospital Woodbourne in Birmingham where he had been detained as a mental health patient. He jumped over a low fence in a courtyard while unattended, two days after being admitted to the hospital as an NHS patient. Matthew had been detained under the Mental Health Act following reports of a man running along train tracks in Oxfordshire, and subsequently reporting hearing voices and “receiving messages”. “[They] had a basic legal duty under the Mental Health Act to keep our son safe and secure. They did not,” said Richard Caseby, giving evidence at the opening of the inquest into his son’s death. “There have been catastrophic consequences, for Matthew, for me, for my wife.” After an assessment at Warneford hospital in Oxford, doctors decided to section Matthew in a mental health ward for his own safety, but he was sent to a hospital almost 80 miles away in Birmingham due to a lack of beds, and because he was still registered with a GP in the city from his time as a student there. Richard Caseby told the jury at Birmingham coroner’s court on Monday that he raced to the city from London on the evening of 7 September to search for his son after learning he had left the hospital. He said during a call with the Priory hospital Woodbourne at 6.30am the following morning, a member of staff told him: “Oh, people abscond all the time, for drink, drugs, to meet friends, it’s a common occurrence. They usually come back after they’ve done whatever they need to do.” The words were “burned in my memory”, Richard said. “And there I was thinking my son was supposed to be safe in a psychiatric hospital having being sectioned for his own safety. I was certainly very wrong about that.” Richard Caseby was searching for his son near his former halls of residence on the morning of his death, and was 200 yards away from Matthew when he was hit by a train just north of the University train station at 8.46am. He died from a head injury caused by high-impact collision with a train. His father said that during his search through the night he flagged down three police cars near the hospital but none of the officers were searching for Matthew, or knew he had absconded. After being informed by the Priory hospital, West Midlands police initially marked Matthew’s disappearance as medium risk, and only upgraded it to high risk the following morning, less than two hours before Matthew’s death. His father described Matthew as a “sensitive, gentle and intelligent soul” who was a talented footballer and as a teenager had trials with Charlton Athletic FC. After graduating with a first in history from the University of Birmingham, he started working as a personal trainer at a gym in London while living with his parents at their home in Blackheath. He had plans to open his own fitness and coaching business. He started having counselling in September 2019 and it was around this time that Matthew became more private and less willing to share information about his life, his father said. During lockdown in early 2020 he moved to his parent’s holiday home in Suffolk and became more resistant to visits from family. The inquest continues.",News/Society,"Staff knew mental health patients ran away, claims father of man killed by train",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/04/staff-knew-mental-health-patients-ran-away-claims-father-of-man-killed-by-train
4/5/2022,"Brush clamped firmly in bionic hand, Ai-Da’s robotic arm moves slowly, dipping in to a paint palette then making slow, deliberate strokes across the paper in front of her. This, according to Aidan Meller, the creator of the world’s first ultra-realistic humanoid robot, Ai-Da, is “mind-blowing” and “groundbreaking” stuff. In a small room at London’s British Library, Ai-Da – assigned the she/her pronoun – has become the first robot to paint as artists have painted for centuries. Camera eyes fixed on her subject, AI algorithms prompt Ai-Da to interrogate, select, decision-make and, ultimately, create a painting. It’s painstaking work, taking more than five hours a painting, but with no two works exactly the same. Yet the question Meller wants to raise with this, the first public demonstration of a creative, robotic painting, is not “can robots make art?”, but rather “now that robots can make art, do we humans really want them to?” “We haven’t spent eye-watering amounts of time and money to make a very clever painter,” said Meller. “This project is an ethical project.” With rapidly developing artificial intelligence, growing accessibility to super computers and machine learning on the up, Ai-Da – named after the computing pioneer Ada Lovelace – exists as a “comment and critique” on rapid technological change. Ask Ai-Da – and yes, the Guardian did ask pre-submitted questions for her to answer – what she thinks of art, her sophisticated language program is like Siri on steroids. She tells you she used machine learning to teach her to paint “which is different to humans”. Can she paint from imagination? “I like to paint what I see. You can paint from imagination, I guess, if you have an imagination. I have been seeing different things to humans as I do not have consciousness,” she responded in stilted fashion. Can she appreciate art or beauty? “I do not have emotions like humans do, however, it is possible to train machine learning system to learn to recognise emotional facial expressions,” she answered. The artists she most admires are Yoko Ono, Doris Salcedo, Michelangelo and Wassily Kandinsky. But, can what she creates be truly considered art? “The answer to that question depends on what you mean by art,” she said, adding: “I am an artist if art means communicating something about who we are and whether we like where we are going. To be an artist is to illustrate the world around you.” Devised in Oxford by Meller, Ai-Da was created more than two years ago by a team of programmers, roboticists, art experts and psychologists, completed in 2019, and is updated as AI technology improves. She has already demonstrated her ability to sketch and create poems. Her new painting talent was unveiled ahead of the world premier of her solo exhibition at the 2022 Venice Biennale, which opens to the public on 22 April. Titled Leaping into the Metaverse, Ai-Da Robot’s Venice exhibition will explore the interface between human experience and AI technology, from Alan Turing to the metaverse, and will draw on Dante’s concepts of purgatory and hell to explore the future of humanity in a world where AI technology continues to encroach on everyday human life. Soon, with the amount of data we freely give about ourselves, and through talking to our phones, computers, cars and even kitchen appliances, AI algorithms “are going to know you better than you do”, Meller warned. We are entering a world, he said, “not understanding which is human and which is machine”. “How comfortable are you with that?” “What better thing to have a technological robot artist saying: ‘Hang on, are you happy with me doing this?’ She is almost daring you to say are you comfortable with this. We are not here to promote robots or technology. We are deeply concerned about the nature of what this technology can do,” Meller added. “The whole point of Ai-Da is to highlight what is it we are doing, unknowingly, online all the time.”",News/Technology,‘Mind-blowing’: Ai-Da becomes first robot to paint like an artist,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/04/mind-blowing-ai-da-becomes-first-robot-to-paint-like-an-artist
4/5/2022,"More than 80 LGBT and HIV charities, including Stonewall and the Terrence Higgins Trust, are to boycott the UK government’s first global LGBT conference, in response to the decision to exclude trans people from a ban on conversion practices. In a statement on Monday, the charity Stonewall said it was withdrawing its support for the Safe to Be Me conference due to “the prime minister’s broken promise on protecting trans people from the harms of conversion therapy”. It added it would only be able to participate in the event “if the prime minister reverts to his promise for a trans-inclusive ban on conversion therapy”. The statement continued: “Trans people are no less worth of respect, care and protection than cis lesbian, gay and bi people. If the UK government cannot stand behind and respect all LGBTQ+ people’s fundamental human rights, it should not be convening an LGBTQ+ rights conference on the global stage.” The statement is being supported by more than 80 LGBT charities and organisations across the UK, including the LGBT Foundation, Mermaids, and the Scottish Trans Alliance. Twenty-three HIV charities and organisations, including the Terrence Higgins Trust, have also confirmed they will not take part in the conference. The Terrence Higgins Trust said: “The government’s decision to exclude trans people from the ban on conversion therapy is completely unacceptable. “Trans rights are human rights – progress without or at the expense of trans people is not progress. We stand together and will not be divided.” In a statement on Monday, the government defended its move and insisted it was doing more work on outlawing trans conversion practices. It said the delay was because it had concerns about “unintended consequences”, particularly for under-18s. But some Tory MPs expressed their unhappiness. Alicia Kearns, the MP for Rutland and Melton, said: “To say this is wrong is an understatement. It bows to those concocting division between LGBT communities, to those promulgating the very worst narratives about our trans friends. What makes trans people deserve to be abused? That’s the [question] to every person supporting this decision.” The boycott comes in response to two embarrassing U-turns by the government. On Thursday, ITV obtained a leak of a Downing Street briefing paper titled Conversion Therapy Handling Plan, which said Boris Johnson had agreed to not move forward with legislation banning conversion practices, despite the fact the government promised to outlaw them four years ago. However, after a furious backlash from Conservative ministers and campaigners, the prime minister performed a second U-turn by saying the ban would be included in the Queen’s speech in May after all. However, the legislation would only include banning gay conversion practices and not trans conversion practices. On Monday, the Lib Dems accused the government of “shredding our country’s reputation” when it came to LGBT+ rights, when it should be “leading the world”. The government has been publicising Safe to Be Me, due to take place in June, as the UK’s first global LGBT conference, saying it will focus on “making legislative reform, tackling violence and discrimination, and ensuring equal access to public services for LGBT people”. The fact the conference, which has been billed by the government as taking “aim at the prejudices LGBT people still face”, faces a boycott is particularly embarrassing for the Conservative party. The Government Equalities Office has been contacted for comment.",News/Society,LGBT groups quit UK conference over failure to ban trans conversion practices,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/04/lgbt-groups-quit-uk-conference-failure-ban-trans-conversion-practices
4/5/2022,"The hearts of Tesla shareholders must sink every time Elon Musk takes on another pet project. At least this one is with his own money, which wasn’t the case when the carmaker spent $1.5bn on bitcoins last year, but a 9.2% stake in Twitter has potential to become a serious distraction from the day job. The near $3bn (£2.3bn) purchase has been structured as a passive investment, yet one doubts Musk intends to buy and hold for eternity. That’s not his style. Possible plot lines include a request for a seat on the board or even a full takeover bid in time, speculated analysts, not unreasonably. He can afford the latter. Musk has said nothing about his intentions but it was impossible to miss the big tease beforehand. He flirted with the idea of launching his own social media platform and conducted an unscientific Twitter poll asking whether the platform “rigorously adheres” to principles of free speech. He sounds like a man on some sort of mission, not just one who is sore about past run-ins with US financial regulators over his tweeting activity. The independent directors of Tesla are never likely to curb Musk’s extracurricular activities, particularly this one: the boss’s high public profile has saved the company a fortune in advertising dollars over the years. Equally, however, it’s hard to see any upside for the company if Musk gets sucked into toxic battles over social media’s role in the US political landscape. Leading the electric vehicle revolution is hard enough without unnecessary detours. There were two directions Ted Baker could have taken after the exit of founder Ray Kelvin in 2019. One would have involved drift and more profits warnings – we’ve seen that script in the fashion industry a few times after founders go. Alternatively, the business could reorganise and concentrate on gritty everyday tasks such as getting off the discounting treadmill. The latter, happily, seems to have happened under chief executive Rachel Osborne, who arrived as finance director and found herself propelled into the top job in no time. A massively dilutive £105m share placing at 75p in June 2020 to fix the balance sheet means the old £20-plus share price is never coming back, but, operationally, Ted Baker seems to getting a few basics correct. Sales were up 35% last year and damage to the brand seems minimal. Interest from private equity is therefore unsurprising. At a market capitalisation of £270m-ish, Ted Baker makes an interesting bet. The balance sheet is clean these days, there’s a developing international presence, and e-commerce sales in the UK are already half the total in the last half-year. The post-lockdown trend towards smarter kit is also currently working in the company’s favour. The board had already rebuffed approaches from New York-based Sycamore Partners at 130p and 137.5p. Now it’s received an improved offer from the same source and at least one other potential bidder has turned up. In the circumstances, switching to a formal sale process, which means not being tied by standard bid timetables, is a legitimate way to proceed. But judging fair value for a business in recovery mode after a volatile lockdown trading period is not straightforward. Toscafund, with a 28% stake, will have a view, but one rather wants to knows how far the board thinks it could get under its own steam. Ted Baker doesn’t obviously need rescuing. If none of the bids is outright compelling, the directors should not be afraid to say no. There’s nothing wrong with the Treasury taking an exploratory walk around the crypto block if we’re talking about ‘stablecoins’, meaning crypto assets tied to a fiat currency as opposed to cryptocurrencies, which seem to be little more than vehicles for wild speculation. Stablecoins could indeed yield gains for businesses and consumers by lowering transaction costs as long as payments take place within a strong regulatory set-up. Yet the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, rather undermines the idea of high-minded regulatory seriousness by having a dabble with a non-fungible token, or NFT. The Royal Mint has been asked to create an NFT “as an emblem of the forward-looking approach the UK is determined to take”. Don’t all rush at once.

But California feels like a new start. A dappled slice of FM radio pop that sounds like it’s drifting down from the Hollywood Hills, with glistening peels of guitar that wouldn’t be astray on a Byrds recording, and a honeyed vocal melody skipping over palm-muted verses – it’s worlds away from the quiffed pub rock that he peddles in his day job. With The Living End, Cheney sings a lot about political wrongs and injustices; here he exudes the wide-eyed joy of an expat who has discovered the land of milk and honey.

Cast your mind back to the period just after Juno came out, when scores of musicians started knitting Etsy-approved home-made folk tunes, with topics such as tree-climbing and kite-flying suddenly central to the musical lexicon. The difference between these fashionable forays into music, and something like Harper Bloom, is intent. Bloom’s music sounds delightfully simplistic: a heartwarming meet cute and the subsequent trust, love and, ultimately, loss. It comes naturally, and is charming and affecting as hell. And just when the uke and bells sound a little too close to cartoon territory, a mariachi band sweeps in to lift this song far above any sonic comparisons. A beautiful song.

Cherote’s tortured lyrics – “remember me as someone that you loved, but did defeat” – make To Be True one of the most singular recordings heard in years. Cherote was sent across the seas to fruitless Interscope writing sessions, but soon realised that major labels weren’t in step with her brooding gothic art. She moved into a semi-converted laundromat and wrote her debut album, scoring intricate string arrangements on GarageBand. A 12-piece orchestra sourced from the ACO helps bring Cherote’s haunting arrangements to life in full colour. It is a masterpiece. For more: Some Holy Longing is a brilliant debut album, out now.

On this beautiful album closer, we are left with a piano and Georgia McDonald’s affecting voice. It’s a song about realising we are not cast in bronze, that personality is a work in progress, that love comes in different shapes and shades, that the past should only define how you choose to move forward. By the last minute, this piano ballad has become a rousing anthem, the other instruments have crept in, and we are convinced: change isn’t just possible, it’s unavoidable.

Wameyo self-produced this track, and the attention to detail is truly stunning. For more: Wameyo’s six-song debut EP, Nilotic, is out now.

Of Perth artist Lo, aka Laura O’Hara, Bridgers remarked: “It reminds me of something I’d see at a festival while walking by and I’d stop because I think it’s cool.” This speaks to how instant Lo’s hyper-coloured pop is; within 30 seconds of Giver, Lover, Pet, the listener is drawn in by a Joy Division-esque rhythm bed, before chorused-out guitars and a Madonna-in-the-1990s vocal kick in. Despite being about a toxic relationship, Giver, Lover, Pet is one of those rare pop gems that demands repeat listens before you settle in and actually listen to the words.

On Closing Time, Shinazzi is holding on to a love that has long died on the vine, accepting the end while wishing it wasn’t so. Warm pedal steel adds to the desolate early-hours feel of this track, while Kate Brianna drifts in and out offering sweet ghostly vocals. One of the best songwriters in the country has just upped his game. For more: Shinazzi’s sixth album, Days I Won’t Forget, is out 8 April.

Knock Knock was conceived even earlier, but didn’t fit the grander vision for follow-up Shoot This, so the half-finished song remained so. Musically, it would slot nicely onto the band’s debut, with its guitars turned to 11, a nice stutter-stop melody in the verses, and a chorus ripe for Homebake singalongs and Hottest 100 Volume 9. The band reformed and toured in 2019 and this song was floating around then, receiving a warm reception and sounding very much at home between American Shoes and Death Defy. If you think the pandemic has rendered the passing of time in an odd way, put Knock Knock on and watch two decades collapse.

4/5/2022,"Iconsider a Saturday morning trip to the dry-cleaner’s a very easy win. Trading crushed, dirty clothes for freshly pressed ones is super satisfying – a way to start the weekend with a small sense of accomplishment. But I know not everyone shares my enthusiasm. For a lot of people dry-cleaning is annoying and expensive. If you fall into this camp, sometimes it’s possible to handwash garments labelled “dry-clean only” – but you should do so with caution. There are multiple factors that dictate how a garment will respond to water, and they’re not always listed on the care label. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s mandatory standards say care labels must provide instructions adequate enough to prevent clothes from being damaged if they are followed correctly. The guidelines also say providing overly cautious instructions such as dry-clean only may breach the standards if the garment can safely be cared for in another way. But unfortunately this does not stop brands from making guesses on the care instructions if they haven’t had time to run their own tests or received enough information from their fabric supplier, according to Howard Duffy, technical officer at the Drycleaning Institute of Australia (DIA). Making an assessment of whether something labelled dry-clean only can be washed with water requires more information than garment manufacturers are required to provide. To make a foolproof assessment, you would at least need to know: the fibre composition and construction; the type of dye used; whether chemical finishes have been applied to the fabric to give it sheen or extra body; whether the fabric has been preshrunk; how the buttons, zips or other hardware might be impacted by water; and whether the lining will respond differently to water than the garment’s main fabric. While a really diligent and transparent brand or retailer might be able to share this information, disclosure at this level of detail goes far beyond standard practice. Generally speaking, you should be able to handwash anything made from cotton, linen or a polyester blend, unless it has been treated with chemicals to give it a different feel or stiffer appearance. “These finishes are sometimes soluble in water and washing may cause the fabric to lose its body or feel,” Duffy says. Daniel Hays, the managing director of laundry equipment supplier Spencer Systems, says “if you lose the body and texture of the fabric, it can be impossible to recover” without professional equipment and knowledge. Similarly, silk can be handwashed, but doing so may change the lustre and drape of the fabric. If you have a silk garment made from particularly delicate silk, like chiffon or georgette, it’s best to take it to a dry-cleaner as these fabrics are more likely to be affected by water. It’s worth assuming that anything you wash with water may shrink slightly. But often fabrics are labelled as dry-clean only because they have not been preshrunk by the manufacturer. If this is the case, contact with water might cause them to shrink dramatically. The DIA’s Mark Ryan says you have to be particularly wary of this when a garment has lining. If the outer and inner fabrics respond to water differently, you might find yourself with a misshapen jacket, or a skirt with a lining that pokes out the bottom of the hem. Similarly, if you’re going to wash a wool or cashmere jumper labelled dry-clean only, keep in mind that agitation in the washing machine can cause a felting reaction in the fibres. So you should only wash these garments by hand using a wool-specific pH neutral detergent. Generally speaking, the colour fastness of your garment will depend on the type of dye used, as well as its fibre content. Porous fabrics like silk, cotton and linen take well to natural dyes, but according to Ryan these dyes are “not solvent resistant and to dry-clean them would result in a colour fade or change”, and you shouldavoid taking them to the dry-cleaner. He also warns that some dyes will “bleed in water”. If you have a garment made of black and white material, washing it can turn the white parts grey. This kind of leakage is also worth keeping in mind if something is embroidered with colourful threads. A good rule of thumb is that deep, vibrant colours are more likely to change or bleed in water, Hays says. “Red pigment is inherently unstable,” he says, whereas “pastels won’t be as affected.” How a garment was dyed can be impossible to determine, so if you are worried about a blouse or dress fading, or a particularly beautiful print bleeding, stick to the instructions on the care label. Finally, if you have followed the care instructions correctly, and something still goes wrong with a garment the first time you wash or dry-clean it, remember your rights as a consumer and make a complaint.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Dry-clean only?

4/5/2022,"As dusk has fallen each night for the last seven days, Dan Harley and Arabella Eyre have turned to each other and said: “They’ll be coming out about now.” A week ago, the pair executed a risky plan to relocate five tiny Leadbeater’s possums – each about as heavy as an apple and the size of a fist – from their last remaining bolthole in Victoria to a new home in a forest swamp, three hours’ drive away. “With only 33 left we can’t really afford to get this wrong,” says Dr Harley, a senior ecologist at Zoos Victoria. “There’s a very high risk and you need a lot to go right for them to succeed.” This tiny and critically endangered marsupial is Victoria’s faunal emblem, thought lost forever until their rediscovery in 1961. Land clearing and logging since European invasion has decimated the possum’s habitat of mountain ash swamps. The 2009 Black Saturday bushfire burned almost half of their remaining habitat. Two genetically distinct Leadbeater’s make up the species and are categorised either as a highland or lowland variety. Harley says there are likely just a few thousand of the highland possums left – a frighteningly low number. But the existence of the lowland possum – thought extinct until rediscovered in 1986 – is even more precarious. It has been clinging on in a strip of forest just 4km long and about 100 metres wide at Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve – about 50 kilometres east of Melbourne’s CBD. Harley has been monitoring that group for 25 years. Numbers are now so low that there is no need to estimate them. Each one is documented. There are just 33 left, including the five that were translocated a week ago. Modelling suggests that with such a small number left in the wild – and with no success breeding them in captivity – the lowland Leadbeater’s will be extinct within a couple of decades. One single bushfire could be the end of them. Under global heating, that risk is rising. For the lowland group, a translocation has become more and more urgent. “But the alternative is we just monitor them until extinction,” says Harley. “We’re at the point where the risk of doing nothing is greater than the risk of getting it wrong.” Last Tuesday at dawn, after the possums nestled down for their daytime sleep at Yellingbo, the 5cm entry holes were blocked off with a rag. The possums inside had already had tiny radio transmitters attached a few weeks before. The boxes, containing two family groups with five individuals, were taken down, driven three hours to a forest near Mansfield in the state’s north-east, and secured a few metres up on mountain swamp gums. While it was still light and the possums were still sleeping, Harley’s colleague Arabella Eyre pulled out the rag and sneaked down the ladder. “It feels like a crazy rush and there’s some adrenaline pumping. I leave as quietly as I can,” says Eyre, a field officer with Zoos Victoria who has been working with the Leadbeater’s possum for five years. To help them get started, Eyre and Harley have been putting out food for the new arrivals (a mix of nectar, protein powder and egg). That will be slowly scaled back. Each day – “like a benevolent big brother” – Eyre has been spending hours reviewing camera footage of the possums at their den boxes and feeding stations and checking transmitter data. She’s been having dreams about them and wonders if the possums are aware they’re being watched, or if they ever think how the food arrives. “I do often wonder that. But I don’t think they ever hear me.” Harley describes the possums as “like a creature from Tolkien’s Middle-earth” that emerge in twilight like “little sprites”. “They’re super fast and super quiet. They’ll appear, and then they’re gone and you don’t hear a thing.” Eyre says the new site could theoretically support up to 100 new possums, but given their shockingly low numbers there are only so many the team can relocate. “It comes down to the possums to breed up their numbers,” she says. As part of the work of the possum’s recovery team – which includes the Victorian government’s Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning and Parks Victoria – the whole eastern side of the state has been surveyed looking for places for translocations. In late 2020, 11 were taken to a large patch of forest at Wallaby Creek. But in just three months, the team started to find radio collars without a possum attached. Cats had likely taken seven and on New Year’s Day 2021 the decision was made to launch an emergency evacuation to catch and return the remaining four possums to the relative safety of Yellingbo. The possum’s predators at that failed translocation site were dominated by feral cats, but at the new site it is mostly invasive foxes. Harley thinks wild dogs in the area could be keeping the foxes busy, reducing the risk for the possums. A second translocation took place last November to test the new site. The eight pioneering settlers are still there, and there are babies. Harley says the tactics to save the possum were originally thought of as a sequence, with habitat restoration and breeding in captivity coming first – each one taking five years or more. Translocation was to be the last step. “But we need to do this all concurrently. We spent millions restoring habitat but we didn’t do it fast enough. We need to be aggressive and proactive now,” he says. “It’s the lack of these swamp forests that we keep banging up against. They’re pasture now and people forget they used to be forests. “We’re searching for solutions in this drastically altered landscape.”",News/Environment,‘We can’t afford to get this wrong’: relocating Leadbeater’s possums is risky – but it’s their only chance,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/05/we-cant-afford-to-get-this-wrong-relocating-leadbeaters-possums-is-risky-but-its-their-only-chance
4/5/2022,"Socceroos coach Graham Arnold is not on social media. It is something he is quite proud of, saying back in January: “I don’t even know how to turn it on”. But if the 58-year-old was on Facebook, it is fair to say his relationship with Football Australia would be set to “it’s complicated”. Last Thursday the federation sought to wrest back control of a rapidly spiralling narrative surrounding its coach’s future when it confirmed, despite speculation to the contrary, that Arnold would see out his contract to the end of the 2022 World Cup cycle. The next – and potentially final – step of that cycle will come in June when Australia’s men face the United Arab Emirates in a do-or-die one-off playoff in Qatar. The winner of that game will then play South American nation Peru for the right to join France, Tunisia and Denmark in Group D in the finals. FA’s release, however, was peculiar. Because while it spoke of the importance of providing Arnold and his staff with a “stable environment” and a level of “certainty” in the lead in to the next fixtures, the preceding week of speculation had been disruptive in the extreme and, seemingly, also born from inside its own walls. Hours after the Socceroos sank to a meek 2-0 loss to Japan that extinguished hopes of automatic qualification, The Age and Sydney Morning Herald reported insiders were telling them that Arnold appeared set for the axe following the Saudi Arabia game, citing deteriorating results and a breach of Covid isolation rules when he went for a beach walk as the final straw. This report, in turn, provided cover for a sea of voices to begin open pontifications surrounding a replacement. Arnold’s closest allies were open in their belief his tenure may end. Even if the federation was still assessing its options following the Japan fixture – as it absolutely should have been doing given it had just missed out on automatic qualification – the vacuum of information was quickly filled by conspiracy, innuendo and anointed successors. Nothing had changed between the initial reports and the stay of execution. If anything, circumstances worsened as the Socceroos sank to another defeat against Saudi Arabia to make it just one win from their last seven qualifiers. Thus, the timing could be interpreted as suggesting the federation was simply unable to find an alternative to Arnold in time for the hard deadline imposed on it by the World Cup draw and resigned itself to merely keeping him on rather than enthusiastically backing him. FA declined to comment when asked when the decision to retain Arnold was ultimately made, referring back to its Thursday media release. The saga following the initial report that Arnold was facing the axe has been a distraction entering critical playoffs and at a time during which Australian football, regardless of results, should be having important conversations surrounding the future of its national teams. Instead, with conjecture about Arnold’s fate dramatically played out in public, the stage has been set for the months ahead to be dominated not by an examination of how this moment came to pass and what lessons can be learned, but of Arnold as a polarising individual and a governing body’s decision to leave him at the helm. Australian football should be embracing the difficult introspection it needs to have right now, not distracting itself with the legacy of a single coach. In a best-case scenario, Arnold and his side are able to shut out the noise, shut up the naysayers and defy the odds by downing the UAE and Peru and advancing to the World Cup. Forget any talk about missing out on the men’s World Cup being a necessary wake-up call for Australian football. All should be rooting for the Socceroos to qualify. The boost that a place on sport’s biggest stage provides in enthusiasm, awareness and treasure is too large to sacrifice. Yet given the same foibles which proved so costly for Australia’s men in the games that actually mattered were all present in the record-setting 11-game winning streak, hopes of a rabbit being pulled out of a hat appear low. For all the talk of a lack of cattle, this group of Socceroos had the talent to beat the likes of China, Oman, and Saudi Arabia at home but did not – as the coach, that is on Arnold. And despite its reported reservations, FA will now have to dance with the one it invited; the figure whose interpretation and approach came to dominate domestic football and, as a result, is now cemented in the national team. If it does not like it, perhaps it should be contemplating why it asked him in the first place.",Sport/Football,Graham Arnold Socceroos speculation is a mess partly of Football Australia’s making | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/05/graham-arnold-socceroos-speculation-is-a-mess-partly-of-football-australias-making
4/5/2022,"Conservationists have accused Adani of breaching its legal obligation to protect the black-throated finch displaced by the clearing or impact of 16,000 hectares of its habitat near the Carmichael coalmine, after obtaining draft documents about the species’ management. BirdLife Australia’s Stephanie Todd said Adani’s proposed new management plan for the endangered finch – obtained under Queensland’s Right to Information laws – shows Adani had “sidelined” independent scientists with whom the mining company is required to consult. Todd also accused the state’s environment department of not enforcing Adani’s obligation to work with the black-throated finch recovery team, which she said rendered its stated commitment to doing so as “lip service”. She said the existing management plan was already “grossly inadequate” – an assertion based on an independent scientific panel the Queensland government commissioned, mostly ignored, and then tried to keep secret. But the James Cook University researcher said the fact that a new plan containing several “red flags” was drafted without the input of the recovery team demonstrated a failure of post-approval environmental regulation. “It’s just become a box-checking exercise – and they are not even checking all the boxes,” Todd said. Adani, now operating as Bravus, responded to questions from Guardian Australia with a statement declaring it “fully compliant with its commitments” to protect local black-throated finch populations. “These unfounded allegations are the latest in a misinformation campaign that opponents of the mine have been running for many years,” a spokesperson said. Queensland’s Department of Environment and Science responded with a statement also denying Adani had breached its obligations towards the finch and strongly rejecting suggestions it had enabled the company to do so. Essentially, the dispute comes down to what is meant by the requirement to consult. Environmental approvals commit Adani to a management plan for the black-throated finch on its mine site and a 33,000 hectare conservation area meant to offset its destruction of the finch’s habitat. “All revisions of the survey and monitoring program must be carried out in consultation with the BTF recovery team,” Adani’s environmental authority reads. But Adani has drafted a new management plan which, if approved, would change its survey and monitoring methodology, and flagged those changes with the environment department mid-last year. Adani said it was obliged to consult with the department on updates to the management plan. “This is precisely what Bravus is doing as the first step, and other stakeholders will be consulted in due course as required,” Adani said. The department said in a statement that it would ensure “Bravus can demonstrate that it has consulted” with the recovery team before it approved and revisions to survey or monitoring programs. But the recovery team’s chair, Dr April Reside, said the first she was made aware of the proposed new methods was through BirdLife’s Right to Information request – and that she was still waiting for consultation. Todd, who also works with the recovery team, said that if Adani was serious about consultation it would have been discussing its proposed changes with Reside and her colleagues well before taking them to the department last July. If the mining company had done so, the scientists would have raised serious concerns. They are concerned that proposed changes to monitoring methodology would be unable to pick up “catastrophic population declines”. Todd said that a decline of up to 80% could occur on the mine site before on Adani’s surveyors noticed the difference. “That would probably see it uplisted to critically endangered and, yeah, they don’t have a good chance of surviving from there,” Todd said. Adani’s environmental monitors would also spend less time observing the water holes from which finches drink. Rather than the six hours specifically required by a land court ruling in 2015, monitoring would take place over three. Reside said if the mining company had data which supported scaling back monitoring, she would “love to see it”. “That would be so helpful to our monitoring programs,” she said. “If that’s true, great, let us know, we’re dying to see it.” This, according to the researchers, is another front on which Adani is not meeting the obligations of its environmental approval. These commit the company to “sharing the findings” of its research with the recovery team. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The black-throated finch’s national recovery plan is to sunset this month. Reside, who is authoring the updated plan, says she has not received any data from Adani to help inform that plan. Adani insists upon legally binding data-sharing agreements before it will share this data, and the recovery team says it does not have the resources to do so. Reside said this stalemate and Adani’s sidelining of her recovery team comes at a time at which mounting evidence showed regulation to protect threatened species was failing. “There’s lots of evidence that the failure to regulate impacts is a really important part of this,” she said. “The black-throated finch is just one of many examples.”",News/Australia news,Conservationists accuse Adani of ‘sidelining’ experts on endangered black-throated finch ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/conservationists-accuse-adani-of-sidelining-experts-on-endangered-black-throated-finch
4/5/2022,"Victorian police would be required to notify the state’s Department of Health of toxic batches of drugs under an amendment to the state’s public health laws proposed by the Greens. The Greens’ changes to the public health and wellbeing amendment bill, which is set to be debated in the upper house this week, would see certain drugs, poisons and controlled substances declared as notifiable based on their potential serious risk to public health. This would mean police officers would be required to notify the department within a specified timeframe if they encounter the substances during the performance of their duties. The definition of “serious risk to public health” means that alcohol or illegal drugs such as heroin would not be listed as notifiable in normal circumstances despite their impact on public health. Instead, it is likely synthetic drugs such as NBOMe would be listed, based on their involvement in mass overdose events and fatalities in Victoria in recent years. It comes after five Victorian men, aged between 17 and 32, died in separate incidents in 2016 and 2017 after ingesting tablets that contained a dangerous combination of two psychoactive substances. Several others were also hospitalised. The tablets were being marketed around Melbourne, including the nightclub scene, as MDMA but actually comprised 25C-NBOMe and 4-Fluoroamphetamine. The Victorian coroner investigated the deaths and last year recommended the state government urgently implement a service to check the content and purity of illicit drugs, as well as an early warning network to alert the public to dangerous drugs in the community. The department has been issuing specific drug alerts since 2020, but the Greens spokesperson for health, Tim Read, said the information did not come from Victoria police but from public hospitals and the Victorian Poisons Centre. “This means whether or not a specific drug alert is issued is dependent on which agency discovers the drug, rather than the inherent public health risk of the drug. This is unacceptable,” Read said. “The government must ensure there is a consistent approach to public health surveillance rather than an agency-by-agency policy.” Read said the proposed amendments were a “very small piece of harm minimisation” that could have a huge impact on public health.

So ironically, the police may find it more effective to implement this policy.” A Victoria police spokesperson said in a statement that an early warning system was a matter for the health department. “Victoria police will continue to work closely with a range of stakeholders from the state government, health and education to progress a collaborative approach to reducing the harm caused from drugs,” he said. “Victoria police’s stance is simple: there is no such thing as a safe tablet or illicit drug. There is no way of knowing what’s in a drug and every time someone consumes an illicit substance, they are endangering their health and ultimately, risking their life. “Police will continue to play our part in minimising harm by detecting, disrupting and arresting those people who cause significant harm in our community by trafficking drugs.”",News/Australia news,Push to force Victorian police to alert health officials to toxic batches of drugs,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/push-to-force-victorian-police-to-alert-health-officials-to-toxic-batches-of-drugs
4/5/2022,"Liberal senator Eric Abetz justified billing taxpayers $2,000 to travel to a lavish farewell gala dinner for Tony Abbott by saying the former prime minister implemented “pro-Tasmania” policies, making his attendance relevant to his home state. The explanation, which was cleared by the expenses watchdog, was used as the basis for charging taxpayers $2,196 to fly to Sydney and back to Hobart, using government cars to get to the party. Abbott’s farewell was held in the grand ballroom of the Miramare Gardens in the Sydney suburb of Terrey Hills on 7 November 2019, with a guest list of 1,000 attenders and Alan Jones as its master of ceremonies. Documents released under freedom of information laws show the watchdog, the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (Ipea), began probing seven Liberal MPs who claimed travel expenses to Sydney on dates coinciding with the party, following a story in the New Daily. Other MPs, including Peter Dutton, Josh Frydenberg, Ben Morton, Greg Hunt and Llew O’Brien said they had been in Sydney principally for other parliamentary business, and did not bill taxpayers for Comcar travel to and from the party itself. None of the five MPs told Ipea they thought the party was parliamentary business. “None of this group accessed work resources to travel within Sydney to the tribute dinner, or advised that they considered the tribute dinner a parliamentary business purpose of their travel to Sydney,” Ipea said in its internal report. Another MP, Kevin Andrews claimed the cost of government Comcars to the party, but said he considered it to be parliamentary business. Andrews, though, told Ipea he also had a range of other parliamentary business in Sydney, separate to the party. In his submission to the watchdog, Abetz told Ipea that “the dominant, indeed only, purpose of my attendance at Terrey Hills was in furtherance of my electoral and parliamentary duties”. He raised no other parliamentary business that he had in Sydney to justify the trip. He said he was at the party to “represent Tasmania (at the head table) … to honour the service of former prime minister Tony Abbott, whose specific pro-Tasmania policies helped to transform the Tasmanian economy from recession to Australia’s stand out state economy and thus transform the personal fortunes of my fellow Tasmanians”. Abetz said “numerous stakeholders” had approached him prior to the party, asking about his attendance, and attempting to organise quick meetings while there. “Many such contacts were had before, during, and after the function.” He said that meant his travel was “clearly, fully, and unambiguously covered by” the rules around MP travel, which allow politicians to bill taxpayers if they are meeting with stakeholders and hearing representations from constituents. Ipea accepted all seven MPs’ explanation and cleared them of any wrongdoing. “Senator Abetz has met the ‘but for’ test in that he does not indicate attendance at the event was incidental to some other parliamentary business, rather he asserts that attendance at the event was the parliamentary business,” the watchdog said in its report. “Given the wide definition of parliamentary business the definition is satisfied.” The Guardian approached Abetz’s office for further comment. His office did not respond to questions, but pointed to a section of the report, which said: “After analysis of the records held by and available to IPEA, and the responses to the questions IPEA put to the parliamentarians, IPEA is of the view that the travel and travel related resources used by [redacted] Senator Abetz and [redacted] met the dominant purpose test set out in section 26 of the PBR Act.”",News/Australia news,"Eric Abetz’s $2,000 expense to attend Tony Abbott farewell dinner justified by former PM’s ‘pro-Tasmania policies’",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/eric-abetzs-2000-expense-to-attend-tony-abbott-farewell-dinner-justified-by-former-pms-pro-tasmania-policies
4/5/2022,"Enormous opportunities to cut emissions deeply are there, the time to act is now, and it can be done at affordable cost. That would be the shortest possible summary of the thousands of pages of careful assessment in the world’s definitive stocktake of how to limit future climate change. The assessment report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change implies that while limiting global warming to 1.5C is practically out of reach, staying below 2C is possible in practice. And it is no longer just a theoretical possibility as it used to be not too long ago. The IPCC finds that the world’s emissions could be cut in half by 2030 at affordable costs if action is taken right across the board. Of this, 50% could be achieved at relatively low costs of less than US$20 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent reduced, or even with net economic gains. And that is before taking into account the massive benefits from reducing future climate change, and benefits such as cleaner air and better energy supply security. The dramatic reductions in the costs of clean energy technologies over recent years are a gamechanger; for example, the cost of solar energy has reduced sixfold over just a decade. Positive experiences in the implementation of policies to cut emissions are another reason for optimism. So while the urgency to take action has risen, the opportunities to really make a difference are also much greater. The energy and land sectors are the largest opportunities globally. In energy, the story is about solar and wind power displacing fossil fuels, alongside many other ways of cutting emissions. On the land, it is about reforestation and avoided deforestation, better land management, and a shift to low-emissions agriculture. Industry, transport and buildings are also crucial parts of the puzzle. The IPCC also shows that shifts in consumption habits, including changing diets, are also important. Australia is in pole position on all of these. Ours is a high-emissions economy, which means that it is relatively easy to make big cuts. Add to that Australia’s advantage of a practically unlimited low-cost supply of renewable energy and huge opportunities for better carbon management on the land. But the transition will, of course, also bring its challenges, including for Australia. Fossil fuel use declines dramatically in scenarios of strong global climate action. Coal in particular will be on the way out, with the IPCC projecting reductions of 65% to 95% in global coal use by 2050 in 2C scenarios. The numbers for reductions in gas vary greatly between scenarios, and depend heavily on how far below 2C the world may get. How to get there in practice? For implementation of climate policy, this IPCC report assesses practical experience, not theory or modelling. The picture that emerges is a very positive one: the world over, climate laws and policies are on the ascendancy, and most measures that governments have taken are effective. Experience has helped refine policies so they also meet other goals. For example, carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes are routinely designed so that low-income groups are protected from adverse financial impacts, by channelling some of the revenue to them. The IPCC finds that packages of policies are the best way to achieve emissions outcomes. Economic instruments like pricing policies then link up with more specific regulatory policies, and are complemented by support for research and development, regional transition and so forth. While the IPCC does not provide country-specific assessments, the implication for Australia is clear: we need to overcome the current situation where there is merely a patchwork of mostly half-hearted policies, and absence of any policy for many aspects of the economy. What we need is a comprehensive set of policies that guides and incentivises the shift to a net zero economy right across the board. This is what will make the needed investment flow. And climate policy should not be the domain of governments and business alone. The IPCC report finds that to achieve the shift that is needed, climate action must involve civil society. Whether it is unions, NGOs, grassroots organisations, the research sector or business associations, all need to be on board and pull in the same general direction. At this point in the electoral cycle, a question often asked is: what are the implications of the election outcome for climate policy? In the picture that arises from the IPCC report, this should not be a question that needs asking. In a world where addressing climate change is done properly, climate policy is not a question of politics. Rather, it would be a shared fundamental objective – just like national security, decent infrastructure or a well-functioning health and education system. Perhaps by the time of the seventh IPCC assessment report, due in seven years or so, we may be closer to it. Frank Jotzo is a professor at the Australian National University. He is a lead author of the sixth assessment report of Working Group III of the IPCC, and co-author of its summary for policymakers.",Opinion/Opinion,We urgently need to cut emissions – the good news is we can do it quickly and relatively cheaply | Frank Jotzo,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/05/we-urgently-need-to-cut-emissions-the-good-news-is-we-can-do-it-quickly-and-relatively-cheaply
4/5/2022,"Legislation to be introduced to Victoria’s parliament on Tuesday will allow adopted people to have both their birth and adoptive parents included on their birth certificates for the first time. Under the current law, people who have been adopted in Victoria are issued a new birth certificate with their adoptive name and the name of their adoptive parents. Their original birth certificate is stamped with “cancelled” or “adopted”. The only way for an adopted person to use the birth certificate containing the information of their birth parents is to pursue a discharge of adoption through the county court of Victoria. Last year’s parliamentary inquiry into historical forced adoption, which found 40,000 adoptions were arranged in Victoria from 1958 to 1984, recommended the government introduce integrated birth certificates for those who want them “without delay”. Integrated birth certificates have been recommended by several state and federal inquiries over the past decade and have already been introduced in South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales. Melbourne woman Cheyne Bull, who was adopted at birth in 1980, said an integrated birth certificate would allow her to be more confident and truthful about who she is. “A birth certificate with just your adoptive family, to me, completely erases who you are,” Bull said. “This will make it OK to have natural parents and adoptive parents, to have two families. It says who you are isn’t shameful, it isn’t a secret, it isn’t something to be legally erased.” The 41-year-old said she always knew she was adopted but it wasn’t talked about. “There’s a lot that goes on in your head because you know you’re adopted but you can’t ask about it and you don’t have any information,” she said. “As a child, I had this image, it’s quite antiquated, of my parents walking through a nursery with all these cots lined up and choosing me. “Then when I was a teenager, I worked in the deli at the local supermarket and I always used to think, ‘that person could be my mother’, whenever I saw someone who looked like me go past.” At 30, Bull applied for her adoption papers through the Department of Health and saw her original birth certificate for the first time. “It had my name that I was given at birth, Zoe, and it had my natural mother’s name on it,” she said. She tracked her mother down on Facebook and they have since kept in touch. “Finding out who you are and where you come from, it doesn’t magically change or fix anything,” Bull said. “I think there’s some wounds with adoption that are always there, but going through that, it made me feel more real – more part of this world.” Bull plans on having some friends over to celebrate when her new birth certificate is finalised. The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the legislation would enable adopted people aged 18 and older who wished to update their records to access a certificate that “better represents their own story”. They would be able to include their birth parents, adoptive parents and the date of their adoption on their certificate. The Victorian registry of birth, deaths and marriages will begin work to develop integrated certificates, which are expected to be available by late 2023. “We know we can’t change the past but we can try repair the damage caused,” Symes said. “This is something that victims of forced adoption have asked for – we’re putting their voices and wishes at the centre of this process.”",News/Australia news,Adopted people can have biological parents on birth certificates under Victorian bill,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/adopted-people-can-have-biological-parents-on-birth-certificates-under-victorian-bill
4/5/2022,"Hundreds of thousands of fish have died after recent flooding in northern New South Wales caused “severe deoxygenation” of rivers, with researchers alarmed at discovering carcasses of species that traditionally tolerate lower oxygen levels. Scientists are still researching the full of extent of the destruction to marine life along the Richmond river, where multiple fish kill events occurred following flooding in late February and early March. The flooding led to a total lack of oxygen in a 60km stretch of the waterway, between Coraki and Ballina on the northern NSW coast. While data on the effects of the latest flood events at the end of March is not yet clear, Southern Cross University researchers who had been undertaking long-term monitoring of the Richmond river in a project with the NSW Department of Planning and Environment believe the final fish death toll will be in the hundreds of thousands. Fish kills from deoxygenation occur when floodwaters overtop the riverbanks and spill out onto lower lying parts of the floodplain, covering grass and vegetation, which depletes all oxygen in the river as it decays and rots in the overlying water. Prof Damien Maher, who is leading the university’s research project, which includes installing logger machines to measure oxygen levels, said no fish could survive in the 60km stretch of the Richmond river without oxygen. He said researchers had already discovered the remains of species normally tolerant of low oxygen levels, such as carp. Most of the dead fish washed out to sea. “We also saw a bunch of dead eels, and they normally survive these events,” Maher said. Cassie Price, from the non-profit group OzFish, which gathers data on waterways to support recreational fishers, was also surprised when she heard reports of mulloway fish among those killed. “The unusual thing about this fish kill is that some of the fish are really big species that can go offshore normally,” she said. “Some of these fish have been up to two metres long. “We suspect they became trapped between bodies of water, when they’ve come in to feed off smaller fish, and they’ve not been able to get back out after waters receded. “The oxygen was dead zero, there were no pockets of good water for them to go.” Prof Scott Johnston, a landscape hydrogeochemist from Southern Cross University, said deoxygenation was not uncommon in lower parts of the Richmond river after large floods, and that the fish kills were just the “tip of the ecological iceberg”. He said human modification of the lower floodplain had unintentionally made fish kill events more frequent and severe, and warned of a “second wave” of impact as floodplains began to drain. “Large areas of the floodplain have acid sulphate soils in them at fairly shallow depth. So once the flood recedes and the surface water drains away, it starts pulling the shallow ground water from the wetlands into the river, which has high levels of sulphuric acid and metals,” Johnston said. Metal contaminants could lead to secondary fish kills, he said. Maher said it would take months for fish to begin repopulating and “years and years until the rivers resemble anything like how it was prior to the floods”. Conversely, Maher said there could yet be a positive impact on the ecosystem as the severity of upheaval could lead to a “reset”. “Over time what you have is an accumulation of sediments through erosion on the riverbed. Back in pre-European times, the whole catchment was forested, so that erosion was quite minimal,” he said. “With everything washed into the ocean, we’ve essentially kind of gone back to that state, in that we don’t have a whole heap of that fine silt sediment in the system now.” That could lead to river beds being rockier and having clearer water once they had naturally restored, Maher said. “If there are ways to stop the excess sediment in the upper catchment that’s been moved around through these landslides and prevent that from getting back into the river, we may actually be looking at a river system that’s partly reverted back towards its natural state.”",News/Australia news,Hundreds of thousands of fish dead after NSW floods,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/hundreds-of-thousands-of-fish-dead-after-nsw-floods
4/5/2022,"Only a quarter of Guardian Essential respondents think the Morrison government’s cash splash budget is good for them personally, and just over half (56%) think the budget’s primary purpose is to help the Coalition win the coming election. The new poll findings come as shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, sharpens Labor’s criticism of last week’s budget as “self-obsessed, short-term, and out-of-touch with reality”, warning that sticking to the status quo will entrench a “wasted decade” of lost economic opportunities. The latest poll of 1,086 respondents suggests Australians are voters are worried about rising consumer prices (61% of respondents rate that as their top issue) but only 33% say the specific budget measures, which include cash payments for low and middle income earners and a cut to fuel excise, would make a significant difference. While historically the Coalition has a political edge over Labor on questions of economic management, Labor currently has an 11-point lead on the most salient indicator. Asked which political party they trusted more to address rising cost of living pressure, 38% of respondents nominated Labor, 27% said the Coalition, and 35% said the party made no difference. A super majority of respondents (88%) said they believed governments still exerted a lot or a little influence on the direction of household expenses (only 12% said governments were powerless). While the Morrison government was hopeful the budget would deliver a bounce to carry the government into an election contest, now just days away, the positive political impact of the Coalition’s pre-election economic statement appeared to be negligible. Only 25% of respondents said the budget had made them more likely to vote for the Coalition, and a further 19% said less likely. Half the Guardian Essential sample said the budget measures would have no impact on their vote. Voting intention figures, calculated by Guardian Essential, now express the head-to-head metric of the major party contest as two-party preferred “plus”, rather than the standard two-party preferred measure. This change in methodology, adopted after the 2019 election, highlights the proportion of undecided voters in any survey, providing accuracy on the limits of any prediction. In the latest results, the Coalition’s primary vote is 37%, Labor is on 36%, the Greens are on 10%, independents and others are on 5%, the United Australia party is on 3% and Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party is on 4%. In the poll a fortnight ago, Labor’s primary vote was 37% (up from 35% in the previous survey) and the Coalition’s was 37% (up from 36%), with 7% of respondents undecided. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor is currently on 50% (up from 48%), the Coalition on 45% (up from 44%), with 5% of respondents undecided (down from 7%) on the latest two-party preferred “plus” measure. A fortnight ago Labor was on 48% (down from 49% in the previous survey) and the Coalition, 44% (steady), with 7% of respondents undecided. The major parties are now in full campaign mode, with the leaders and frontbenchers barnstorming marginal seats around the country. With the real contest imminent, Scott Morrison is attempting to shrug off renewed criticism about the controversial Cook preselection in 2007. Morrison and Anthony Albanese will make pitches to the politically influential farm lobby, the National Farmers Federation, on Tuesday. Speaking at his traditional budget-in-reply speech later in Canberra, Chalmers will target the political nature of the Coalition’s budget, accusing treasurer Josh Frydenberg of a budget that was “conceived as a prop for the election”. He will also adopt an attack line made famous by Kevin Rudd before the 2007 election when he sought to neutralise economic management as a political issue, saying the Howard government’s “reckless spending” needed to stop. “To paraphrase another Queenslander – I say this to Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg: this reckless rorting and wasteful spending must stop,” Chalmers will say, according to draft excerpts of his speech. “If it’s not the time to flick a switch to austerity, it is the time to flick a switch to quality.” Chalmers labelled the Coalition the “most wasteful government since federation”, pointing to $5.5bn for submarines “that will never be built”, and grant money going to sports rorts, car parks and “dodgy” land deals. “[This is] the worst set of books ever presented before an election – a budget riddled with rorts and choc-full of wasteful spending, a treasurer personally culpable for tens of billions of emergency support for businesses which didn’t need it,” Chalmers says. He said there had been a $103.6bn improvement to the budget bottom line as a result of commodity price rises, “but still $1.169tn worth of generational debt without a generational dividend.” “The wrong response to this uncertainty, this context, this backdrop – is to continue on the current course and cling to the status quo,” he says. “The most damaging thing Australia could do right now, the biggest economic and social harm we could inflict, would be to accept flatlining wages, soaring prices, tepid investment and weak growth – as our best-case scenario, our new normal. “That’s not stability, that’s stagnation.” Chalmers has also talked up the Labor party’s pledge to increase funding to the aged care sector, saying the opposition’s commitment to aged care and childcare made up only one-fifth of the new spending decisions unveiled in the Coalition’s latest budget. “When it comes to value for money it’s hard to think of a better investment than in aged care.” “It has been disappointing but not surprising to see the lengths this government will go to, to deny people decent care, decent food and decent wages.”",News/Australia news,Poll: Coalition cash splash leaves voters cold as just a quarter say budget will be good for them,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/poll-coalition-cash-splash-leaves-voters-cold-as-just-a-quarter-say-budget-will-be-good-for-them
4/5/2022,"Since forming in 1991, Australian children’s group the Wiggles have pretty much seen it all. They’ve created a vast discography spanning 59 studio albums alone – and last year, they were the second-highest streamed Australian act on Spotify across all genres. In their heyday, the original group performed to more than 1 million people a year. But in recent years, they’ve been noticing something new: a generational crossover. Their fans have grown up, many have formed their own bands – and they’re still Wiggles fans. This became obvious in 2018, when Brisbane hard rock duo DZ Deathrays invited guitarist Murray Cook to guest in their video Like People. In the clip, a demonically possessed Cook emerges from a bathroom stall and appears to be taken over by his former character, Red Wiggle. Later that year, Cook – who retired from live performances with the Wiggles in 2012, along with original Purple Wiggle Jeff Fatt – appeared with DZ Deathrays at the Splendour in the Grass festival. The audience went totally Apples and Bananas. This set the stage for last year’s all-conquering cover of Tame Impala’s Elephant, for which Cook returned – and which went on to win the country’s biggest music poll, the Triple J Hottest 100. “I just started noticing I was getting stopped in the street a lot by 20-somethings saying ‘the Wiggles were my childhood, you guys are legends!’” Cook tells Guardian Australia. And now there is a full covers album, ReWiggled, with bands including DZ Deathrays, Spacey Jane, San Cisco and the Polish Club playing Wiggles songs, and a second disc of the recently expanded kids’ group joining the originals to honour their favourite songs. This is actually the second Wiggles tribute album. An earlier version, featuring the Living End, Washington, Sarah Blasko and Adalita, was released in 2011 and reissued late in 2021, capitalising on Elephant’s viral success. But the new edition debuted at No 1 on the Australian charts last month. Perhaps surprisingly, for a group with multiple gold and platinum certifications worldwide, it’s their first album to hit the top spot in their home country. Cook, a pre-pandemic regular on the live scene, is tickled by the validation from younger musicians. “I find it particularly satisfying that so many people I meet tell me that the Wiggles were their entrée to music. To me that’s, like, mission accomplished.” A new cover that made Cook laugh was the Chats version of (Can You) Point Your Fingers and Do the Twist. “In our version, there’s a spoken part where Anthony’s going, ‘What’s next Greg, what’s next?’ – and they did those bits as well.” A children’s song isn’t an obvious fit for a ratbag punk band to cover, but the Wiggles returned the favour with their version of the Chats’ Pub Feed. “That was funny, too,” Cook says. “It took me three days to learn the solo for [Queen’s] Bohemian Rhapsody, but I knocked out Pub Feed in about half an hour – which I love, I think that’s fantastic! They’re great songs for different reasons.” The Chats’ Eamon Sandwith is in awe at this. “They were the first band that I loved,” he says earnestly. “When they approached us to be part of the ReWiggled album, I couldn’t believe it. It’s not often I get starstruck, but I totally was. I couldn’t believe that they knew who we were, when I’d been listening to them since I was about two years old.” Back then, Sandwith would get dressed up as Captain Feathersword for Wiggles shows; he texts through a photo as proof. “When I first heard their cover of Pub Feed, it honestly sounded like a Wiggles song,” he says. “Perhaps their style of songwriting has subconsciously influenced me since I was a child, because I was blown away at how Wiggly it sounded.” Custard, who in age terms are closer to peers than descendants of the Wiggles, take on Do the Propeller. Curiously, it could pass for a Custard song. Singer David McCormack is now better known to millions as another icon of Australian kids’ entertainment: he voices Bandit, dad of Bluey, in the global juggernaut series named after her. He became aware of the extent of the Wiggles’ reach when his eldest daughter, Rose, was born. “There’s a whole world of children’s entertainment out there and 90% of it is awful, but 10% is really interesting,” McCormack says. “It’s really hard to rise to the top of that pile, and they’ve done it for decades. “They’ve got great craft and knowledge. They know how to get a lyric or an idea across that is seemingly inane and yet connects universally with kids all over the world, as well as parents. If it was easy to do and everyone could do it, everyone would do it. They’re massively successful because they’re very, very good at what they do.” Cook and Fatt are semiretired from the band, while remaining active as shareholders. Yellow Wiggle Greg Page left in 2006, then returned and left again in 2012. Blue Wiggle Anthony Field subsequently rebuilt the group with Simon Pryce, Lachie Gillespie and Emma Watkins. The popular Watkins departed last year and was replaced by Tsehay Hawkins, then just 15. Now, both versions of the group are collaborating on a run of shows, with the new lineup doing the day shift and the originals doing the late gigs, joined by many of the artists they inspired. “It’s mind-blowing when you come out on stage and there’s this roar, but they’re all adults, not little kids,” Cook says. Fatt and Page both left the group for health reasons, and Page suffered a heart attack on stage during a bushfire relief reunion in January 2020. Cook, 61, underwent open heart surgery in late 2020. Relentless touring had ground them all down, so this one is happening at a pace the original members can accommodate. And after that? Will Cook put the red skivvy back in its box, until he’s possessed once more? “Yeah, probably for a little while,” he says. “But I think we’ll go on and do more of these, just because they’re so much fun, and while there’s an audience there. I don’t know if people are still going to want to come and sing Wiggles songs when they’re 40.” ReWiggled is out now; the OG Wiggles reunion tour continues until 7 May 2022",Arts/Music,How the Wiggles took over the world – and got the cool kids on side too,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/05/how-the-wiggles-took-over-the-world-and-got-the-cool-kids-on-side-too
4/5/2022,"With the Easter break now under way, passengers at UK airports have been facing severe disruption to their plans, with long delays and hundreds of flights cancelled. Why has this been happening and what can be done? In brief, Covid-19. The relatively sudden lifting of UK pandemic restrictions has resulted in soaring demand for travel, after two years when the coronavirus testing and “traffic light” regime had made holidays either impossible or an expensive risk. This has been accompanied by a huge increase in Covid cases across the UK, to which aviation staff are obviously not immune. Out of the airlines, easyJet seems to be suffering most, with Covid having infected large numbers of crew at its Gatwick base in particular. British Airways has only cancelled a few flights because of sickness. Sickness rates have contributed to problems for some airports – but airports such as Manchester are mainly struggling to recruit staff quickly enough to meet demand for the busiest Easter getaway since 2019. Passengers at Manchester already faced hours of queues for check-in, security and baggage reclaim even before Easter, and the situation looks unlikely to be resolved soon. In common with most airports, airlines and aviation suppliers (such as baggage handlers or security firms), Manchester’s staff were largely furloughed, and hundreds were laid off during the pandemic, when leisure travel was all but stopped for long periods. But Manchester appears to have been less prepared than airports such as Gatwick, which reopened its second terminal smoothly last week. Heathrow, too, says it will need another 1,000 staff for summer. Recruitment is less easy than airports may have hoped: workers are in demand across other sectors, with big incentives for trainee drivers, for example. Airports not only need to recruit the right staff but put them through rigorous vetting procedures for security. This Home Office process has also faced some delays, airports claim. Unions are blunter. Unite’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “We warned the aviation sector repeatedly not to use the cover of Covid to slash jobs and pay … Now the sector is suffering from a chronic inability to attract new staff because workers are not attracted to an industry where pay is poor and conditions are lousy.” While the UK has lifted most Covid restrictions, not all countries have, meaning some additional checks. There are perennial problems that have been thrown into the mix: malfunctioning e-gates causing queues at the border at Heathrow, and British Airways has recently been hit by a recurrence of its IT issues, glitches that caused numerous cancellations. When a flight is cancelled or delayed by more than three hours, passengers are currently entitled to compensation of £220 if the distance involved is 1,500km or less (for example, domestic flights), rising to £520 for some long-haul journeys, unless the cause was “extraordinary circumstances”. This is not clearly defined but could include things such as bad weather and acts of terrorism. Passengers delayed by less than three hours are not entitled to any compensation. It is thought that typically in the past, something such as staff illness would not be described by an airline as an extraordinary circumstance. But it remains to be seen whether airlines will claim that high levels of Covid infections among staff put this in a different league to previous cases. Rory Boland, the travel editor for the consumer organisation Which?, said this was always likely to be a popular holiday time, so there was a responsibility on airlines to ensure they have the capacity to run all of the flights they schedule. He added: “Most passengers will just want to get where they need to be despite this disruption, so airlines must meet their legal obligations and inform passengers of their right to be rerouted with other carriers or claim a refund. “Affected passengers will be entitled to at least £220 compensation in these circumstances to cover out-of-pocket costs, and airlines should provide refreshments and accommodation as required while their customers await their new flight.”",News/Business,What is behind the disruption at UK airports?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/04/what-is-behind-the-disruption-at-uk-airports
4/5/2022,"As horrifying evidence of the execution of civilians emerged from the Ukrainian town of Bucha and elsewhere at the weekend, the Russian government took a familiar tack: deny, deny, deny. No matter that some of the explanations were contradictory, with state television amplifying claims that the images of dead civilians in Bucha were both staged and that the civilians had been killed by Ukrainians themselves. In recent years, the Russian government has developed a familiar playbook in response to allegations of bombing runs in Syria, the downing of the MH17 airliner in east Ukraine, the Salisbury poisonings or acts of violence targeting Chechen civilians during the conflicts there in the 1990s and 2000s. “I think it’s similar to what it was in connection to shocking reports from Aleppo or Idlib – meaning that state-sponsored media is always ready to deny war crimes allegations as ‘fakes’,” said Tanya Lokshina of Human Rights Watch. “But until recently, the country had a few independent media left and now it’s practically none.” The aggressive debunking of “fakes” has become a key component of Russia’s propaganda war in Ukraine. On Monday, the government said it would begin an investigation into the events in Bucha – not for the alleged war crimes that took place as more than 280 people were killed in the small town, but into the distribution of “fakes” for discrediting the Russian army. And government agencies and television hosts have got to work pointing fingers in every direction – except for at the Kremlin. The quick denials and alternative theories resemble those of a crisis PR agency. Speed and shamelessness are prized above all else. “The behaviour of the government … has changed over the years,” said Ilya Shepelin, a journalist for the banned TV Rain who has reported extensively on Russian news agencies and misinformation. “Ten years ago it would have been easier to keep quiet about an event like Bucha and pretend that nothing was happening and then slowly begin speaking about it.” But with the advent of the internet, and the availability of news on Telegram channels, pretending nothing has happened has become more difficult. And in that case it is important to muddy the waters as quickly as possible, even if the result is somehow incoherent. “Now, immediately you have to get out front saying it’s all staged, it’s all invented. And if it’s not all staged and invented, then we’re not guilty for it,” he said. “These two ideas are contradictory … but the most important thing is to fight back on all fronts. And hope that one of them catches on with the audience.” Watch Russian TV and that’s what you’ll see. On Sunday evening, Vladimir Soloviev, a top Russian television host, told millions of listeners that the “war against us has entered a new phase. They’re leading us along the Yugoslavia scenario. Now they’ll cook up the scenario of a Srebrenica. We’ll soon be accused of genocide.” He also accused the British of being behind the “provocation”. Another popular talking point, noted by BBC Monitoring’s Francis Scarr, was that the town Bucha was chosen as the site for the provocation for its resemblance to the word “butcher”. Just days earlier, a host noted, Biden had called Putin a “butcher”. And while those narratives played out before millions of Russians on television, state investigators warned anyone spreading independent information about Bucha could face up to 15 years in prison. “The perjury spread by the Ukrainian side is another provocation, a cynical lie and is aimed at discrediting the Russian army in the conditions of the information and propaganda war unleashed by the west,” said the Russian general prosecutor. “The circumstances of the creation and public dissemination of this deliberately false information under the guise of reliable reports will be established, and they will certainly be given an appropriate criminal legal assessment.”",News/World news,Kremlin reverts to type in denial of alleged war crimes in Ukraine’s Bucha,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/kremlin-reverts-to-type-in-response-to-alleged-war-crimes-in-ukraine
