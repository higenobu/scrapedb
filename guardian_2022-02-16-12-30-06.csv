2/16/2022,"Melbourne entrepreneur Geoff Bainbridge, a co-founder of Grill’d, has resigned as chief executive of an ASX-listed whiskey distillery after the emergence of video, published today in a media outlet, purportedly showing him intoxicated while smoking methamphetamine. Bainbridge alleges he is the victim of an extortion attempt by foreign criminals, according to the Age and Sydney Morning Herald, which reported he received anonymous threats as recently as Tuesday that the footage, which he says was filmed in 2015, and was published today in the Australian, would be released unless he chose to “negotiate”. According to those reports Bainbridge confirms it is him in the video but “says he isn’t an ice user and doesn’t know how he came to have the drug or what else he was given”.  News Corp published the footage on Wednesday morning which appears to show Bainbridge smoking an unverified substance, purportedly methamphetamine, from a glass pipe while making sexually explicit comments. The board of Lark Distilling, which is worth $340m, met on Tuesday for an emergency board meeting about Bainbridge, who has been the company’s chief executive and managing director since mid-2020. On Wednesday, Lark announced that Bainbridge had resigned “effective immediately to enable him to manage a personal matter that was brought to the attention of the board on the afternoon of 15 February 2022”. Bainbridge, 50, helped to found the successful burger chain Grill’d, but recently ended his association with the company. In a statement to News Corp, Bainbridge’s lawyers said: “The attempted extortion of Mr Bainbridge commenced years before he had any involvement in Lark Distillery; and Mr Bainbridge has sought the assistance of London-based professionals with the extortion attempt.” According to reports in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, Bainbridge said “Ultimately, I put myself in a situation I shouldn’t have been in. “I’m a victim of extortion but that wouldn’t have occurred without my poor judgment. I am deeply remorseful for my own actions.” He said the extortion attempt began in December 2015, while he was in south-east Asia.",News/Australia news,Grill’d co-founder Geoff Bainbridge quits Lark Distilling board over alleged drug use video,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/16/grilld-co-founder-geoff-bainbridge-quits-lark-distilling-board-over-alleged-drug-use-video
2/16/2022,"Exotic parrots are on a non-stop flight to becoming a menace in New Zealand, as pet owners release hundreds of them into the wild each year and, in doing so, put the survival of native birds at risk. Roughly 6% of New Zealanders own pet birds and an average of 331 of the animals are lost each year; 92% of these are exotic parrots, mostly in the Auckland region, according to the University of Auckland.  The numbers are conservative because scientists rely heavily on bird-owners reporting that they have lost their parrot, the university’s associate professor in biological studies, Dr Margaret Stanley, said. In some cases, people would not report it online, and in other cases, they were deliberately releasing them, she said. She has run simulations on the probability of pet parrots of the same species being found in the wild together, which would give them an opportunity to breed and eventually compete for the same food and nest space as native birds. “We looked at all the details on survivorship and lifespan for these species, and what we found was that for the seven species that we modelled, it was more than an 80% chance that a male-female pair were at large in the same local board area, at any given time. That was actually 100% for the Indian ring-necked parakeet and the Alexandrine parakeet – even worse, because we know these two species can hybridise.” The parrots also run the risk of introducing diseases, which is bad news for the 40% of New Zealand’s birds already considered endangered. “Once they’re breeding, it’s very, very hard to eradicate or control them,” Stanley said. Auckland Council’s biosecurity principal biosecurity adviser Dr Imogen Bassett said the results do not surprise her. “We do see regular reports of parrots on ‘lost and found’ pages on websites, and we get people calling council saying they’ve seen parrots, so they’re definitely out there. I think people generally underestimate the extent to which they are around.” From 1 September, Aucklanders will be banned from breeding and selling a number of exotic parrots, including monk parakeets, ringneck parakeets, and rainbow lorikeets, under the city’s pest management plan. “They have a massive track record of being invasive in dozens of countries and posing a real problem,” Bassett said. “That’s why research like Margaret’s is particularly concerning because it does really highlight the depressing risk we have of joining all those other countries.” That’s riled some owners and breeders in Auckland, but Bassett said consultation is under way over some parrot species that are already common in the environment, including eastern rosellas. “The horse has already bolted [for rosellas], so the ones we are most concerned about are those that we don’t already have wild populations of.” Bassett says New Zealand has the opportunity to stamp out a parrot invasion now, unlike when possums, rats, rabbits and other pests were introduced to the country in the 19th century. “Now 150 years later, we’re picking up the pieces of that very expensive and messy problem. We know with biosecurity that prevention is better than cure.” Stanley added that it cannot be just a regional approach, there must be a nationwide ban. “At the moment you can buy one on TradeMe from Hamilton and get it sent to Auckland, and breeders are talking about moving out of Auckland to set up shop.” “[Regulation] is a little bit toothless if it’s not nationwide.”",News/World news,Escaped pet parrots pose ‘real problem’ to native New Zealand birds,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/escaped-pet-parrots-pose-real-problem-to-native-new-zealand-birds
2/16/2022,"The Victorian government has entered into exclusive negotiations to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games in the state’s regions, trumping Tasmania’s recent bid to host the event. Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, announced a two-month exclusivity agreement was signed with the Commonwealth Games Federation on Tuesday night, with work now under way to assess the viability of hosting.  He said the government’s submission would focus on the state’s regions, rather than Melbourne, which most recently held the event in 2006. “It’s not just about rerunning what was done back in 2006. Our vision is for this to be predominantly a regional Victorian event. It’s about taking this amazing competition across many, many different sports into regional cities and towns,” Andrews said on Wednesday. He said it was too soon to know what time of year the event would take place, which sports would be included and which cities and towns would participate, although he noted athletics facilities were available in Ballarat, while Bendigo Basketball Stadium had been recently upgraded and Geelong had an aquatics centre and GMHBA Stadium. “Our starting position is very strong but yes, there would need to be further investment made, and that’s how I’d see it – not as a cost but a massive investment, built by locals,” he said. “Just think about the number of small- and medium-sized businesses, tradesmen and women working across regional Victoria, building the infrastructure that we need – and then that infrastructure is there as a lasting legacy. “All of that makes perfect sense and all of it, I think, is more powerful the more further away from Melbourne you get.” He said the Gold Coast region saw a net economic benefit of $2.5bn when it hosted the 2018 games. The announcement follows reports the Commonwealth Games Federation was struggling to find a host for the 2026 games. D​​urban, South Africa, was stripped of the right to stage the 2022 Commonwealth Games due to financial issues and was replaced by Birmingham, England, which was originally scheduled as 2026 host, leaving a vacancy. Perth withdrew from the process earlier this year, with the Western Australian government citing the uncertainty posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and at least $1bn of investment required to establish the required infrastructure. Kuala Lumpur, Cardiff, Calgary, Edmonton and Adelaide had all earlier withdrawn from proposed bids. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Last week, Tasmania formally requested Hobart and Launceston be considered as host or co-host for the event. Andrews, however, said the government’s bid was for Victoria “to the exclusion of all others”. Tasmania’s premier, Peter Gutwein, said he was disappointed with Commonwealth Games Australia’s handling of the situation. “The first I heard that they were exclusively dealing with Victoria was through the media. I have a meeting with Commonwealth Games Australia later this week and I will have further discussions with them then,” he told reporters on Wednesday. Gutwein said he remained hopeful Tasmania could play a role in the 2026 games. “We offer some great co-hosting options,’” he said. Victoria Tourism Industry Council’s chief executive, Felicia Mariani, said hosting the 2026 games would “supercharge” the state’s visitor economy. She said the Covid-19 pandemic had wiped nearly $20bn from visitor spend in the state. “The implications of restrictions have decimated our tourism and events industry, which has truly emerged as the worst affected industry across the board,” Mariani said in a statement. “Initiatives such as this are exactly what’s needed to rebuild, reimagine and re-engineer the enviable position we have built up over two decades as we established Victoria’s global profile.”",News/Australia news,"Regional Victoria the frontrunner to host 2026 Commonwealth Games, thwarting Tasmania",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/16/regional-victoria-the-frontrunner-to-host-2026-commonweath-games-thwarting-tasmania
