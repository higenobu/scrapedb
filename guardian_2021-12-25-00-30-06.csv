12/25/2021,"My father Robert Chenciner, who has died aged 76 of cancer, was a scholar and writer on the ethnographic and material cultures of the Caucasus and former Soviet states. He first obtained permission to visit Dagestan in 1986. Through years of ethnographic fieldwork, and with the help of Dr Magomedkhan Magomedkhanov and local scholars, Robert – known to many as Bob or Chence – visited hundreds of Dagestani villages. He became a senior associate member of St Antony’s College, Oxford, in 1987, and an honorary member of the Dagestan Scientific Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1990.  My father would talk of how his heart should return to the Dagestan mountains as he loved them so dearly, and wrote definitively on the region in Daghestan Today (1989), Daghestan: Tradition and Survival (1997) and Tattooed Mountain Women and Spoonboxes of Dagestan (2006). This last was shortlisted for the Bookseller’s Diagram prize for oddest title of the year. For more than two decades he also worked as an immigration expert, championing people fleeing former Soviet states. To meetings at Chatham House and St Antony’s College he brought his characteristic energy and a healthy distrust of authority. As part of this commitment, he worked for OSCE – the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe – as an election monitor in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Belarus. Born in London, Robert was the son of Ellen (nee Perls) and Mark Chenciner, a lawyer. He and his mother joined relatives in Canada after his father’s death, but he returned to Britain to attend Fonthill prep school, in East Sussex, and Epsom College in Surrey, after his mother’s death. He wrote about his early esoteric interests in Dragons, Padlocks and Tamerlane’s Balls in 2012, citing the essay he had written aged 18 on Swedish padlock keyhole covers, for which he was awarded a Trevelyan scholarship to read mechanical sciences at Pembroke College, Cambridge. My father had an original perception of textiles, objects and people. His understanding of natural dyes and colour was manifest in Madder Red: A History of Luxury and Trade (2000). His collection of Kaitag textiles formed the basis of the books Kaitag: Textile Art from Daghestan (1993) and Kaitag: Daghestani Silk Embroidery, An Italian Collection (2007). He lectured widely on these interests, and tickled controversy with papers including The Bayeux Tapestry Shish Kebab Mystery, delivered at the Oxford Food Symposium in 1990, which appeared to call the tapestry’s authenticity into question. He would happily accept compensation for lectures in the form of salt-cured sturgeon, Caspian caviar or well-hung horsemeat, depending on the location. Despite the early loss of his parents, my father had a great sense of generosity, home and food; his lunches were a delight, and such was his warmth that his former home in Shepherd Market, London, was “borrowed” as a fictional safe-house in John le Carré’s Our Game, set amid the first Russian-Chechnya war. Robert was a force; a beacon; a bracing optimist. He is survived by his wife, Marian Ellingworth, whom he married in 1993, and two daughters, Isabel and me.",News/World news,Robert Chenciner obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/robert-chenciner-obituary
12/25/2021,"E-scooter trials are to be prolonged until late 2022 as the government weighs up legalisation, with use of public rental vehicles dwarfed by that of an estimated half million illegal e-scooters in Britain. Legislation has been put on hold amid increasing safety concerns over private unregulated e-scooters – especially with tens of thousands more vehicles expected to be sold in the UK this Christmas – and scepticism that legal e-scooters can ameliorate congestion or public health.  A negative decision would come as a blow to mobility firms that have invested tens of millions of pounds to enter the UK market, which has lagged European neighbours in embracing e-scooters. Businesses have become concerned at the length of trials which were originally due to last 12 months from mid-2020, but are now being extended to November 2022. Evangelists for micromobility argue that e-scooters are far greener than cars, and are a transport solution that tackles the “last mile” from home or work, allowing users to connect to buses or trains. But influential voices in government suggest that far from switching from cars, most e-scooter users were previously cycling, walking or on public transport, which have better health benefits and environmental credentials. Meanwhile, scientists have warned that the UK’s Christmas scooter spree will consume hundreds of tonnes of precious elements, mainly lithium and cobalt in batteries. According to the Royal Society of Chemistry, unless e-scooters are used daily for many years and replace a car, their impact on the environment is ultimately damaging, with high carbon costs in manufacture as well as mining raw materials. While MPs on the transport select committee last year recommended legalisation of all e-scooters, privately owned as well as those on rental schemes, government sources suggest that ministers are far from convinced – with safety concerns at the forefront. At least nine people are known to have died in accidents using e-scooters illegally in 2021, according to the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety (Pacts). NHS trauma specialists cited in a recent Pacts report said they were now treating more and more e-scooter riders, many with “life changing head injuries”. One London-based neurosurgeon said the severity of e-scooter riders’ injuries were “more similar to those of motorcyclists than pedal cyclists”. An interim report is due to be published by the Department for Transport showing data from the trials which started in July last year in Middlesbrough and now are taking place in 34 areas of England (with Wales and Scotland so far declining the opportunity). While the government data remains under wraps, a source said it was “not encouraging”, suggesting it showed only a small fraction of e-scooter trips replacing a car journey, with many simply riding for fun, and the biggest proportion riding instead of walking: “On those figures, there wouldn’t be a carbon saving, there would be a carbon increase.” Ministers wrote to retailers before Christmas to remind them of the law on private e-scooters, after being urged by the executive director of Pacts, David Davies, to hold them liable, as well as warn users of the risks. Davies said: “There is a lot of confusion and we’d like to see more awareness-raising … certainly some retailers are not going out of their way to inform their customers. They are significantly more risky than bicycles.” The Guide Dogs charity recently commissioned independent testing that showed a pedestrian hit by a legal e-scooter at the top permitted speed, 15.5mph, could suffer fatal injury. Operators, as well as Pacts, stress that the safety differences between legal, regulated models and private e-scooters is huge. According to Alan Clarke, director of public policy at Lime, which launched its e-scooters in Milton Keynes in August 2020, followed by Greater Manchester and London this year, the former have “two independent brakes, [are] stability tested, [with] lights you can see 300 metres away”; most people will buy a model with “small wheels, one handbrake, and not fit to be used on roads or cycle lanes.” Fred Jones, regional general manager at Tier, which operates e-scooters in 13 countries and is part of the trials in York and London, said: “What’s clear is that the majority of anecdotal issues of safety and concern is almost exclusively with the private side. If someone’s willing to do something illegal, they may have a greater disposition to do something irresponsible when riding them.” Almost 200,000 people have used Lime’s vehicles, making more than 822,000 trips, on average travelling 2km each time. While casualty reports from illegal scooters have overwhelmingly involved male riders, Clarke said rental e-scooters are used by a broad demographic across sex, race and age groups. Clarke maintains e-scooters can be part of multi-model public transport – even if for now all remain banned from London’s trains and buses after a spate of battery fires – with the busiest docks in the capital found next to tube stations. “That shows us people are using them to link into another transport mode.” The Department for Transport says it is waiting to gather all the evidence from trials before making any decision. Meanwhile though, it has extended the deadline for a further eight months, until 30 November 2022, to get more data while tweaking the trials to introduce compulsory ID plates. Operators remain largely upbeat, despite the delay, which will have hit the business plans of the firms hoping to expand across the UK after the trials. Jones said: “Any business would love clarity for five years when you’re taking out warehouses and things.” But he remains confident e-scooters will be legalised in some form in the UK, with Ireland recently starting legislation to permit their use on roads, one of the last EU states to do so: “The momentum across Europe bodes well.”",News/World news,Trial delays put a brake on e-scooter makers’ UK ambitions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/trial-delays-put-a-brake-on-e-scooter-makers-uk-ambitions
12/25/2021,"The number of Christmas Eve shoppers in British city centres has slumped as people stay in to avoid the risk of being infected with the Omicron coronavirus variant, data suggests. Central London was hardest hit, with footfall down 30% compared with Friday last week, and 48% compared with Christmas Eve in 2019, according to data covering morning trading from Springboard. Footfall also fell by 10% week on week in other cities.  The government has so far held off on imposing new restrictions on England. However, shopper numbers have fallen dramatically as people avoid crowds to ensure they are able to see family at Christmas. Footfall was lower than Christmas Eve 2019 across high streets, retail parks and shopping centres – although all categories were also stronger than Christmas Eve 2020, when large parts of England were placed in a surprise lockdown and other parts of the UK put restrictions in place. Retail parks suffered the smallest declines this year, down only 7.1% compared with Christmas Eve 2019 – and up by nearly a quarter on last week. Numbers were up 6.7% across high streets overall compared with last week when including visits to towns. “The increased activity in retail parks today will in part be due to trips for food and grocery products as the majority of retail parks have a food store,” said Diane Wehrle, Springboard’s insights director. “However, since the start of Covid, retail parks have consistently been more resilient in retaining shoppers as they are open spaces, with large stores which make shoppers feel safer and less nervous.” The Omicron variant has severely hit trading for many shops during what is usually their busiest time of the year, and forecasts for the coming days are bleak. Analysts at GlobalData said it expected Boxing Day sales online and in shops to be 10% lower than pre-pandemic levels, and 1% lower than last Christmas. Spending in stores is likely to be 23% lower than 2019, they said. England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, last week advised people to cut down on socialising, while Wales and Northern Ireland have both announced a return to the “rule of six” for hospitality starting on Boxing Day. Scotland restricted sporting events and advised people to stay at home as well. Retailers and hospitality companies will have to cope this Christmas without much of the emergency government support that helped them through a similar period in 2020. The government’s coronavirus job retention scheme, which supported the wages of furloughed workers, ended in September. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, last week announced a plan to spend £1bn on struggling hospitality and leisure businesses hit by the Omicron slump, but grants of only £6,000 a venue were criticised as insufficient to make up for the decline in business.

The hard-running Conor Gallagher is sure to have his work cut out in central midfield for Crystal Palace, then, while Patrick Vieira will hope to welcome Joachim Andersen back to bolster the defence. The manager revealed that Palace have “a couple of cases” of Covid-19 in the squad, although he did not say which players had been affected, and that “we hope we are going to be OK” for the match on Boxing Day.

12/25/2021,"During the past 20 months I’ve become addicted to TV shows about women trying and failing to make it. Broad City, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, 2 Broke Girls: it’s like looking in a mirror, if I could be bothered to do even that. But the absolute fabulous queen loser of all is Awkwafina, in her self-created show Nora from Queens. Awkwafina plays a bizarro-reverse-mirror version of herself as a nearly thirtysomething bum, living in her childhood home with her grandmother and her widowed father. It’s pure lockdown comfort TV, with every petty slight and worldly favour soothed away by familial love. Nothing Nora from Queens does ever works out, and yet it’s always fine in the end. Attempted jobs, moneymaking schemes, love interests and opportunities for growth come and go, with all the wit and humour being incidental. The laughs come from off-the-cuff comments, the quickest physical reactions and scathing jibes, but the emotion is gooey and true. And that’s how I live now – with Nora from Queens as my more adorable, charismatic, sexy, funny, hipster-chic proxy. I actually have the same sloppy tracksuit bottoms, oversized T-shirts, thick dorky glasses and button-down overshirts that Nora wears in the show. If she gets up at noon every day in TV fantasyland, heck, I do it every day in reality. And if she fails at everything while refusing to leave her childhood home or embrace adulthood, well, me too – and I’m 10 years older than Awkwafina herself and 15 older than the show’s character.  So cosily attractive is Nora from Queens that it’s weird to splinter out the real, hugely successful writer and performer from the fictional loser she plays. Fictional Nora tries so hard, while Awkwafina (whose real name is indeed Nora Lum) gets profiled by Vogue, walks the red carpet and rises effortlessly to fame. And yet I still feel she’s only a quick FaceTime connection away. If she can make it, why can’t I? I mean, she first got famous with a laconic YouTube mumblecore rap hit called My Vag: “My vag like tasting heaven/ your vag manages a 7-Eleven … My vag a chrome Range Rover/ your vag hatchback ’81 Toyota.” I can do that, even though my own vag is solid Fiat Panda territory, and I don’t have her talent. My appreciation of Awkwafina isn’t different from most people’s desire for escapist narratives under lockdown, for the lives of the rich and famous and gifted, for success stories and transformation tales. It’s just that Awkwafina’s talent and drive are presented with a relatable contemporary veneer. Politicised and witty, she has cool-girl charisma that contains vulnerability and a dark side. She lost her mother when she was very young but is from a stable and supportive background, which enabled her to excel at LaGuardia – the Fame school, whose alumni include Timothée Chalamet and Sarah Paulson. And from there Awkwafina studied journalism at SUNY (State University of New York at Albany). A street hustler she is not. From the stasis of my Nora-from-Queens-like life, I watched her break into bona fide Hollywood stardom, going from small roles in Ocean’s 8 and Crazy Rich Asians (a scene-stealing turn) to a Golden Globe-winning lead role in Lulu Wang’s The Farewell and, most recently, starring in the global hit Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Awkwafina embodies the idea that if you rap, write and perform literally from your own street corner, you too might make it big. She’s pure wish fulfilment: the American Dream nimbly retooled for the 21st century.",Lifestyle/Life and style,The person who got me through 2021: Awkwafina made me hopeful for success in dark days,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/24/the-person-who-got-me-through-2021-awkwafina-made-me-hopeful-for-success-in-dark-days
12/25/2021,"We still don’t know how severe the Omicron wave will be, and debates are raging about closing nightclubs, alcohol curfews and work-from-home guidance. It can sometimes feel like last Christmas all over again. But one decision should be clear. Given the tools and knowledge we have now, school closures should be off the table. Why were schools closed at all in previous lockdowns? The best approach was to minimise risk, given the limited knowledge about Covid-19 transmission and with no vaccination available to protect against severe health outcomes and death. Concerns about many different groups factored into policy decisions on schools.  The first concern was the risk to teachers and school workers such as cleaners and security guards being in an environment where they could contract Covid-19 during their working day. Then there was risk to family members, particularly grandparents and vulnerable parents, of children first contracting Covid-19 at school and then bringing it home to their households. There was also the risk to children themselves of contracting Covid-19 at school; the concern for children was less about severe outcomes and death, and more about long Covid and potential long-term health impacts. The final concern was modelling data that suggested that schools being open led to wider overall societal mixing, and a greater number of contacts per person, which could increase the R number and drive exponential growth in transmission levels. But vaccines, testing and knowledge on how to manage Covid-19 transmission have radically altered all of the previous considerations. We now have safe vaccines that are effective at reducing the severe health outcomes of Covid-19, especially with boosters for over-18s. It is positive news that the JCVI has supported vaccinating at-risk children aged between five and 11 and those living with immunocompromised people. However, the UK is again out of line with other countries, many of which opened up vaccination to all children in that age group some months ago. We know that we can reduce transmission in indoor settings such as schools through good ventilation and air-filtration systems: this can range from opening windows to allow a breeze through classrooms and hallways to HEPA filters that completely clean the air several times in an hour. And rapid at-home lateral-flow testing is a simple, quick way of identifying infectious individuals and ensuring they stay out of the school environment until they’re past the infectious period. Probably the biggest impact on slowing Covid-19 spread and breaking chains of transmission is to have infectious individuals isolate and not pass on Covid-19 to anyone else. The UK has led in offering free at-home testing to teachers, school staff and pupils, and that is seen as one of the factors in slowing spread within schools. We also now have concrete evidence on the harms of children being out of school, which we must balance against the risk of harms from Covid. While some cling to the idealised version of online learning with middle-class children with devoted parents sitting next to them teaching with fast broadband and a laptop per child at home, this isn’t the reality for most children, especially those in low-income households. Access to devices such as computers and tablets, and the internet – and having parents with enough free time to support students – are not guaranteed. Children may also have to do work within the household, for example taking care of younger siblings. And they may have to figure out how to set up the technology themselves if they are in households where parents are working outside or absent. In short, virtual learning works for rich families, but not for poor people. This is not just about educational attainment. In-person schooling is also about providing children with a safe, heated space during the day, food, books, outdoor play areas and access to adults trained in teaching and interacting with children. School closures also lead to a loss of play and social interaction, they’re associated with increased domestic abuse, a decrease in physical activity, delayed access to paediatric care, and more mental health issues. Whatever Covid-19 control measures are discussed, school closures should be off the table. Home or remote schooling just doesn’t work and shouldn’t be seen as an acceptable outcome for children. The risks from Covid are better known, and we have more tools to fight it. So instead of closing schools, we need to focus on improving the protections we now have: better vaccination coverage, ventilation and filtration of the air, and identifying infectious individuals with rapid testing. Now is the time to start making plans for schools as essential societal infrastructure, just as hospitals, supermarkets and other essential institutions stayed open even during the strictest lockdown measures.

12/25/2021,"Another year spent indoors should have facilitated another bumper year for video games, that most indoorsy of artistic pursuits. Yet the games industry has shared many of the difficulties that have plagued other creative sectors, where dispersed teams have been forced to collaborate on complex creations. As a result, a clutch of 2021’s big-budget games have been delayed until next year, a situation that has let the sunlight in to draw up more modestly made, independent endeavours. Games such as Unpacking, which tells its unconventional story about a young woman moving into a series of homes exclusively through the act of unpacking the boxes of her belongings. Or Lake, in which you play as a burnt-out programmer who temporarily becomes a postwoman in her pastoral hometown and, by delivering letters and parcels, readapts to more fulfilling rhythms and connections. These and others titles have provided bright flares of creativity in a psychologically demanding year. Meanwhile, the so-called “forever games”, such as Fortnite, Call of Duty and Destiny, which aim to dominate the game space in our lives via regular and indefinite content updates, have provided a reassuring nightly routine with friends for many.  Always a few years behind its more esteemed Hollywood sibling, the games industry has had to contend with stories of systemic abuses – particularly toward women – and a series of high-profile investigations into major companies. Activision Blizzard, publisher of the Call of Duty series, is being investigated by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing following accusations of discrimination and sexual harassment across its studios. While the company’s harangued CEO Bobby Kotick – who, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report, allegedly helped cover up these abuses – remains resolutely in place, treasurers from six US states have called on the company to take drastic action. In video games, far more than any other medium, the effect of economics on design is clear. The earliest arcade games were calibrated so that a newcomer could only play for a few minutes before they had to clunk in another coin. Today, behemothic games such as Call of Duty: Warzone and Fortnite are ostensibly free, making money from the sale of virtual character costumes, Hollywood tie-ins and, somewhat distastefully, vibrant colour schemes and stickers for their weapons. 2021 was the year in which NFTs – limited edition digital assets – have entered the mainstream. With millions of players already groomed to accept the idea of spending £10 on, say, a Rambo costume for their video game character, it seems inevitable that numbered limited edition skins that players can later sell on – with the publisher taking a nifty cut at every stage – are imminent (and, in the case of the child’s game Roblox, fully actualised). Legal and moral questions around what will essentially be stock markets for digital collectibles loom. And the inevitable effects of economic design on the nobler art of game design remain to be seen and understood. A strange year for games, then, and yet one in which the medium remains ever interesting. 1.

12/25/2021,"When Isaac, 16, tested positive for coronavirus a few days ago, he decided to self-isolate alone in his room. He wanted to make sure he did everything he could not to pass the virus on to his family and ensure they were able to have some normality over Christmas. After his mum, Debs, posted what he was doing on Twitter, she was flooded with loving messages to pass on to him. She plans to print them all and put them up on the wall opposite his room for him to see on Christmas Day.  “It’s an amazing thing that he just went ‘no, I’m going to stay away’, and I have said to him ‘if you’re struggling come on in and we’ll just deal with it’. He says if he can, he’ll try to keep it away from us,” she said. It was not a difficult choice for Isaac, who is autistic and lives with his mum and three siblings in Ayrshire. “In his mind, he’s doing what he needs to do to keep us all safe,”Debs said. Isaac is far from alone. More than 600,000 people will be forced to isolate across the UK on Christmas Day after a record 119,789 tested positive, the highest daily figure since the pandemic began. For Mark, 44, a Church of England priest based in Manchester, the run-up to Christmas is an exceptionally busy time of the year. He normally runs church services and midnight mass, but since testing positive a few days ago he has been forced to self -isolate in his room. “Ordinarily, on Christmas Day, I’d normally spend the afternoon quite tired and often have a nap just because I would have been doing lots and lots of church services. So actually tomorrow will be a bit more relaxing than it usually would be for me,” he said. “I’ve got my two cats with me, a pile of books, and probably catching up on a few things on Netflix in bed as well.” His church, and many others across the UK, will be live-streaming some services, including midnight mass, which he plans to watch from the comfort of his bed. Emily, 28, will be self-isolating alone in her London flat with her dog. She works in retail and describes this time of year as “bonkers”. She said she was enjoying the rest regardless of the circumstances, and was Googling tips on what to include in her roast dinner. “I’m not someone who enjoys cooking that much. I don’t do it that often. I’m very much a takeout girl. So it’s actually out of routine for me to cook a massive meal. I’m actually kind of looking forward to it, and I’ve got all the trimmings,” she said. Most of those forced to isolate spoke of their determination to remain upbeat in the face of a second Christmas disrupted by pandemic. Lauren, 31, from London is self-isolating with her husband and has several ways to stay chirpy. “We will be sleeping in as normally Christmas has me up at 5am, have a nice cooked breakfast, opening our gifts to each other, then spending the day playing games, feasting on cheese, speaking to friends and family, skilfully navigating the eight, 11 and 13 hour time differences,” she said. The couple also plan to do some arts and crafts, including pottery, origami and making Christmas crackers, and will have a classic Christmas dinner in the evening. “Personally, a Christmas movie marathon isn’t the right approach as I’ve spent a lot of time in front of the TV the past two years. I want this Christmas to still feel like a special day so Justin and I remember it fondly rather than it just fade into the mists of memory.” Most importantly, she said she would try to remember that tomorrow was just a day and that there were better days ahead.",News/World news,‘Better days ahead’: people forced into Christmas isolation stay upbeat,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/better-days-ahead-people-forced-into-christmas-isolation-stay-upbeat
12/25/2021,"Two married NHS A&E doctors will spend Christmas Day together on the high seas as they race across the Atlantic to raise money for charity. Adam Baker and Charlie Fleury, both 31, are competing in the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge and will row 3,000 miles (4,800km) over the course of more than 40 days in a 24ft boat called Percy – short for Persistence.  They will be up against 35 other crews in what is hailed as the “world’s toughest rowing race”. They are likely to row about 1.5m strokes, burn in excess of 5,000 calories a day each and battle 30ft waves before they reach the finish line at English Harbour in Antigua in the Caribbean. The trip will mark the first time in six years the pair have both been “off” for Christmas at the same time. However, there will be little chance of them being able to rest or indulge in festive treats. Instead, the couple will take it in turns to row Percy, swapping every two hours around the clock. Baker said he was “looking forward to pushing through our perceived mental barriers and taking on the extremes of the ocean”. Fleury said: “It has been incredibly hard to keep the momentum going despite being so mentally fatigued with work pressures, but what good practice to prepare for this ultra-endurance challenge.” It is quite an ambition given that the longest the couple had rowed together before they set off was just five days. But they say their role as A&E doctors at the Royal Devon and Exeter hospital will have prepared them for the challenges ahead and that being a husband and wife team is an advantage. Baker, who previously suffered from sea sickness, said it was his wife’s idea to take part after she went on a polar expedition in Norway, camping under the northern lights in -20C temperatures. When their sailing challenge was delayed for a year because of their commitments during the Covid-19 pandemic he used the time to research sea sickness cures so he could join her. The pair have set their sights on raising £100,000 for the Devon air ambulance, the RD&E charity, which supports the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS foundation trust, the RNLI and Mind. They are also hoping to use their experience to help research into how ultra-endurance sporting events affect men and women differently. Keeping their energy up during the race, which set off on 12 December from La Gomera in the Canary Islands, has also taken some research. Their food for the trip comprises mainly lightweight, calorie-dense foods that can be stomached at sea and snacks including nuts, crisps, nut butters, protein powder and chocolate bars. Aside from their nutritional needs, the couple have credited Harry Potter audiobooks with helping them power on in their endeavour, tweeting author JK Rowling to acknowledge the books’ “powerful magical” effects. Encounters with the natural world have also been keeping their spirits lifted. In an Instagram video, Fleury recalled how “a couple of orcas” came to visit their boat and then a little while later a pod of five with a young orca also came to say hello. “It was really, really magical and was definitely an early Christmas present which was awesome,” she said. Under the team name Emergensea Duo, the couple will attempt to break the mixed pairs record for the crossing, which they state on their website is 43 days, 15 hours and 22 minutes. In 2012, the husband and wife team Helena and Richard Smalman-Smith made a crossing to Barbados in just over 75 days.",News/UK news,Married NHS A&E doctors to spend Christmas Day rowing across Atlantic ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/24/married-nhs-ae-doctors-to-spend-christmas-day-rowing-across-atlantic
12/25/2021,"Disruption to train services is causing headaches for people making late dashes to spend Christmas with family and friends. National Rail had reported issues with at least a dozen operators, including strike action affecting services across Scotland and several parts of England.  The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said a strike by its members who were train managers and senior conductors at CrossCountry was being “solidly supported in all depots”. The action means the company is running a heavily reduced Christmas Eve service, with no trains operating between Aberdeen and Edinburgh; Glasgow Central and Edinburgh; Derby and Nottingham; Leicester and Stansted airport; Cheltenham Spa and Cardiff Central; Newton Abbot and Paignton; or Plymouth and Penzance. A limited service is in place between Edinburgh and Plymouth; Manchester Piccadilly and Bournemouth; and Birmingham New Street and Leicester. The cancellation of train services because of Covid-related staff shortages continues across operators, with LNER, CrossCountry, Avanti West Coast, Northern, ScotRail, Southern, Thameslink and TransPennine Express among those affected. This is involving a combination of planned and short-notice cancellations. Kelly Jones, who was travelling between Bath and Cornwall, said she had been left “cold, stranded and scrambling” to find her way home for Christmas. The 24-year-old told the BBC she was trying to get back to see her siblings after their dad died earlier this year. “This will be our first Christmas without him so I didn’t need this stress. I was given no notification of the cancellation until I [was] midway through my journey, trying to catch a connecting train in Bristol. “This has left me cold, stranded and scrambling to find my way to see my family for Christmas. I do not blame the train drivers themselves. They are striking for better work conditions and to cause disruption to get change – I just wish I had been notified.” With millions of people expected to make journeys on the UK’s roads on Christmas Eve, National Highways has reported severe congestion near Birmingham. The AA estimated there would be 17.8m cars on UK roads on Friday. According to the RAC and the traffic information supplier Inrix, the worst queues were expected in Wiltshire on the A303 between West Solstice Park and the A36. National Highways reported severe congestion on the M6 between junctions 5 and 6 near Birmingham on Friday morning. Thousands of people also learned their Christmas holidays would be cancelled owing to Covid restrictions imposed by their destination countries. The winter sports operator Crystal Ski pulled its trips to Austria departing on 27 December after the introduction of tougher entry requirements because of the Omicron variant. Austria announced on Wednesday that UK arrivals would be required to quarantine for 10 days from Saturday unless they were fully vaccinated, including a booster jab, and had evidence of a recent negative PCR test. Pandemic restrictions across Europe led MSC Cruises to cancel four sailings from the UK by its ship the Magnifica. The cruises, which were due to depart from Southampton on 21 and 28 December and 4 and 11 January, were to call at France, Germany and the Netherlands. The Netherlands has been put into lockdown until at least mid-January, while Germany has joined France in prohibiting UK tourists.",News/UK news,Britain’s last-minute Christmas getaway hit by travel disruption,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/24/britains-last-minute-christmas-getaway-hit-by-travel-disruption
12/25/2021,"My mother, Shirley Wright, who has died aged 85, lived life to the full, travelling widely and completing a Shakespeare master’s as a mature student, despite a difficult start in life. Born in Chatham, Kent, to Kathleen (nee Hardie) and Alfonso Martinez Revasse (anglicised from Rivas), Shirley spent her early years accompanying her mother, who worked as a housekeeper, to various locations in Kent, London and Bath. From the ages of five until 10 her father was absent as a wartime Desert Rat in Egypt. Shirley described her confusion when on his return she enquired of this unrecognisable person: “Are you my daddy?” Recently she talked about how proud she felt walking through Rochester with her father, so handsome in his army uniform.  She somehow succeeded in surviving and overcoming the ill-effects of a difficult relationship with her mother and a lonely childhood. After Wimbledon county grammar school for girls, she went on to grab life with both hands, and to keep holding on and embracing every moment with enthusiasm and passion. Shirley had several jobs, her longest-standing being senior secretary in the office of the department of education at Sussex University. The role we most enjoyed talking about was when she worked at a jewellery shop in the West End and used to transport precious gems by train in secret around the country by sewing them into her bra. In 1959, she married Alan Wright, whom she met at a youth club at Merton Park, south London, when she was 15 and he was 17. They lived in London, then moved to Cambridge where Alan taught at the Leys school; Shirley had a secretarial job and was also involved in Leys school life. In 1964, they went to the US on an exchange programme organised by the English-Speaking Union; my dad swapping roles with an American teacher in Princeton, where they spent about 18 months, travelling extensively. Back in the UK, they moved briefly to Hove in East Sussex before buying a house in nearby Kingston in 1968. Their final move was to Lewes in 1982. Shirley had a sharp intelligence and astonishing recall, both of which seemed to improve as she got older. She had many interests, and devoured books, plays, music and films. After graduating with an BA in cultural studies from Sussex in 1998, she went on to complete an MA in Shakespeare studies at Birmingham University’s Shakespeare Institute in Stratford-upon-Avon. These endeavours gave her huge pleasure and enabled her to finally accept how insightful she was. As age reduced my parents’ sphere of activity, the Depot cinema in Lewes became their favourite cultural location, a cherished home from home. They accumulated an amazing number of friends at every phase of their life. We met people they knew wherever we went. We still do. Shirley is survived by Alan, their children, Judith, Richard and me, and grandchildren, Millie, Niamh, Emily and Oliver.",News/Education,Shirley Wright obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/24/shirley-wright-obituary
12/25/2021,"A Covid outbreak in the Norwich squad means Dean Smith’s side have not played since 14 December and the disheartening 2-0 home loss to his former club Aston Villa. Arsenal have played three times in all competitions since then and won all three, with Emile Smith Rowe in rich form and the squad apparently not rattled by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s exile from the first team. Smith’s stated aim on taking over at Norwich was to make Carrow Road a harder place to visit – and Arsenal have struggled on the road, losing five out of nine away league games this season.
