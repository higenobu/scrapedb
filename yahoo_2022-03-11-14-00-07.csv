3/11/2022,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — More than 55 tons of lettuce have been fed to starving Florida manatees as part of an experimental program to help the slow-moving marine mammals since their natural food is being destroyed by water pollution, wildlife officials said Wednesday. The lettuce, funded by more than 1,000 individual donations, is offered to manatees that gather in the warm water discharge near a power plant on Florida's east coast as they typically do during cold months. Officials from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a conference call that the feeding program has made a difference. “That's a substantial amount,” said Ron Mezich, feeding program coordinator for the Florida wildlife commission. “We're not done yet.” The unprecedented feeding response came after a record 1,100 manatees died last year, largely because of starvation. The problem requires a long-term solution because pollution from agriculture, septic tanks, urban runoff and other sources is killing the seagrass on which the marine mammals rely. Through Feb. 25 this year, about 375 confirmed manatee deaths have been recorded. That compares to 389 during the same period last year; both are far above the 136 deaths reported in 2020 during the first two months. More than 80 rescued manatees are currently being cared for at facilities in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico and Ohio, according to Terri Calleson of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Some of those are abandoned calves that typically take longer to recover. Florida legislators last year provided $8 million for several seagrass restoration projects that will get off the ground this year, officials said. But it won't be an immediate solution. “We're not solving the seagrass issue in a year,"" said Tom Reinert of the Florida wildlife commission. There are currently about 7,500 manatees, also known as sea cows, living in Florida waters. They are listed federally as a threatened species, although there are efforts to give them the heightened endangered designation. The approach of warmer weather means manatees will disperse to areas where food is more plentiful, officials said. “It's warming up, and that's a good thing for manatees. They'll be moving on,” Reinert said. Officials say most distressed manatees in Florida are reported by people who spot them and call a state hotline at 888-404-3922.",U.S./Associated Press,55 tons of lettuce fed to Florida's starving manatees,https://news.yahoo.com/55-tons-lettuce-fed-floridas-183329294.html
3/11/2022,"BEIJING (AP) — China’s Premier Li Keqiang on Friday called the situation in Ukraine “grave” and offered Beijing’s help in playing a “positive role” for peace while continuing to refuse to criticize Russia. China has largely sided with Russia in the conflict, which it has refused to refer to as a war or invasion. The U.S. accuses Beijing of helping spread false news and disinformation coming out of Moscow. China has offered to serve as a facilitator of talks between the sides, although it has little experience in such a role and would not likely be viewed as a neutral party. “We support and encourage all efforts that are conducive to a peaceful settlement of the crisis,"" Li told reporters at an annual news conference. “The pressing task now is to prevent tension from escalating or even getting out of control."" Beijing this week said it was sending humanitarian aid including food and daily necessities worth $791,000 to Ukraine while continuing to oppose sanctions against Russia over its invasion and pledging to continue normal trade and economic cooperation with Moscow. Li, who as China's No. 2 leader behind Xi Jinping is primarily responsible for overseeing the world’s second-largest economy, spoke following the close of the annual session of China’s rubber-stamp legislature. He said China was still opposed to sanctions because they would “hurt the world economic recovery."" “It is in no one’s interest. China is ready to make its own constructive efforts in maintaining world peace and stability and promoting development and prosperity,"" Li said. He also repeated China's assertion that it follows an “independent foreign policy of peace,"" and “maintains that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected."" “The purposes and principles of the U.N. charter should be observed and the legitimate security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously,"" Li said. “On that basis, China makes its own assessment and will work with the international community to play a positive role for the early return of peace.""",World/Associated Press,Premier Li offers China's help for 'grave' Ukraine situation,https://news.yahoo.com/premier-li-offers-chinas-help-030744680.html
3/11/2022,"In just one on-the-ground example of the effect Western sanctions are having on the Russian economy, production of a car long considered a symbol of the country's ""self-reliance"" post-Cold War was brought to a halt on Wednesday now that its parent company's been ""deprived"" of ""the parts and supplies it needs to make cars,"" The Wall Street Journal reports per individuals with knowledge of the situation. The factory for the homegrown Lada car has reportedly placed thousand of workers on leave, a stoppage once considered ""unthinkable,"" the Journal writes. A spokesperson for Lada's parent company AvtoVAZ said the company had planned to halt production until March 11 due to the global chip shortage; he did not comment on the sanctions. It's just the latest disruption for a Russian economy ""beginning to feel the bite of sanctions the West imposed on Moscow"" after President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of neighboring Ukraine, the Journal reports. Over 20 percent of AvtoVAZ's parts are brought in from outside Russia, said sources familiar with the matter. ""If trade stops, AvtoVAZ stops,"" said a former company board member. ""Putin knows that he can't do it by himself."" The ex-member added that it could take months or perhaps years to restart production without French car maker Renault SA, who now owns AvtoVAZ. That in mind, Russia would be facing a ""new-vehicle shortage if car makers like AvtoVAX remain paralyzed."" Lada is the country's only native brand with ""significant market share,"" and is also ""part of Russia's national psyche,"" similar to General Motors for the U.S., the Journal writes.

3/11/2022,"Britain is set to send the world’s most advanced anti-aircraft missile system to Ukraine, the Defence Secretary has announced. Ben Wallace on Wednesday told MPs he is looking at providing the Starstreak High-Velocity Missile systems to the Ukrainians, stepping up the UK’s military assistance to Kyiv. Designed to destroy fighter jets and helicopters, Starstreak is the fastest short-range surface-to-air missile in the world, travelling at over Mach 3. The missile uses three dart-like projectiles allowing multiple hits on the target. It can be fired from the shoulder, from a lightweight multiple launcher or from armoured vehicles. Earlier versions of the system, which is made by defence firm Thales in Belfast, were deployed on top of tower blocks for the 2012 London Olympics, a move which caused some concern among residents. As it was, no missiles were fired during the Olympic games. The system relies on its immense speed to defeat aircraft manoeuvring around a battlefield. Military officials hope the missile, described as “defensive” lethal aid by Mr Wallace, will help Ukraine gain control of the skies and further erode Russia’s fighter jet and helicopter fleets. Once fired, the missile carrying the three darts uses a small charge to blast it clear of the launch tube. This motor cuts out before the missile has left the tube to prevent injury to the operator. At about four metres from the soldier firing the weapon, a second booster fires to accelerate the missile rapidly to over Mach 3. The missile homes in on the target aiming for two laser beams “painted” on the aircraft by the launch unit. All the soldier firing the weapon has to do is keep the target in the sights. The target aircraft has no time to hide behind buildings or outrun the missile, which travels at more than three times the speed of sound. Approaching the target, the three darts, known as “hitiles”, separate from the missile and coast towards the aircraft. The kinetic energy generated by travelling at such speed will destroy most targets, but to ensure complete destruction each dart contains a delayed initiation 0.9kg blast fragmentation warhead that explodes inside the aircraft.Addressing the Commons, Mr Wallace explained the rationale for the potential donation of such missiles. “As the conflict intensifies, the Russians are changing their tactics, so the Ukrainians need to, too,” he said. “We can all see the horrific devastation inflicted on civilian areas by Russian artillery and airstrikes, which have been indiscriminate and murderous. It is therefore vital that Ukraine maintains its ability to fly and to suppress Russian air attack,” he added. Highlighting that the international community has already given man-portable air defence missiles, he said the Ukrainian forces’ capability “needs strengthening”. Following requests for further help from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr Wallace said providing Starstreak will “allow the Ukrainian forces to better defend their skies”. He sought to characterise the weapon supplies as defensive and tactical in nature, so as to avoid handing Vladimir Putin an excuse to refer again to the potential use of nuclear weapons. “Everything we do is bound by the decision to supply defensive systems and [is] calibrated not to escalate to a strategic level,” the Defence Secretary said. However, in another sign that London is stepping up the level of support it is prepared to give, he announced that Britain is about to dispatch a “small consignment” of Javelin missiles to Ukraine. The US and Estonia have already been supplying Kyiv with the infrared-guided anti-tank munitions. Ukraine has been sent a variety of arms that target tanks by the West, including Panzerfaust 3 anti-tank weapons from the Netherlands, and AT4 anti-missile launchers from Sweden. Mr Wallace updated the Commons on other lethal assistance the UK has provided to the Ukrainians in the 14 days since the Russian assault commenced. This includes 1,615 next-generation light anti-weapons known as “NLAWs”, on top of 2,000 of the missiles that were sent before Moscow invaded. The Defence Secretary highlighted that body armour, helmets, boots, ear defenders, ration packs, range-finders and communications equipment had also been donated to Ukraine. “We shall also be increasing supplies of rations, medical equipment, and other non-lethal military aid,” he said. Britain was the first European nation to supply lethal aid to Kyiv, he said, adding that the UK has also “invested in building Ukrainian military capacity since 2015”, alongside the US, Canada and Sweden.",World/The Telegraph,Britain to send world's most advanced anti-aircraft missile system to Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/britain-send-worlds-most-advanced-164309737.html
3/11/2022,"Vladimir Putin has become increasingly isolated in recent years, according to a Russian journalist. In an Op-Ed for The New York Times, journalist Mikhail Zygar said Putin believes he alone can ""save Russia."" Zygar said Putin and his aides are ""obsessed"" with the past and the idea of avenging the ""humiliations"" Russia faced in the 1990s. Russian President Vladimir Putin has become so isolated during the pandemic that he has ""completely lost interest in the present"" and is ""obsessed"" with the past, according to a Russian journalist's essay in The New York Times. Mikhail Zygar is the former editor in chief of the independent Russian TV News channel Dozhd and the author of ""All The Kremlin's Men,"" a book about Putin's inner circle. In an opinion piece for The New York Times, Zygar wrote that his sources close to the Russian President said Putin is ""annoyed"" by issues of the present like the economy, social issues, and the coronavirus pandemic and instead he and his aides ""obsess over the past."" Zygar says it is this obsession with the past that led Putin to invade and start a war in Ukraine. ""In his mind, Mr. Putin finds himself in a unique historical situation in which he can finally recover for the previous years of humiliation,"" Zygar wrote. ""The only Western leader that Mr. Putin took seriously was Germany's previous chancellor, Angela Merkel. Now she is gone and it's time for Russia to avenge the humiliations of the 1990s."" According to Zygar, Putin's aides have long tried to push the message that he is the ""only person who can save Russia"" and he now believes that so strongly he doesn't even trust the people around him. Zygar said in the past there Putin has met with friends and advisors for ""drinks and barbeques,"" but Putin is now cut-off from most of his entourage. Because of the president's strict COVID-19 protocol, some of Putin's closest aides have to quarantine for two or three weeks out of the month just to get a meeting with him, according to Zygar. Putin took extreme measures to isolate himself during the COVID-19 pandemic — his palace in Novo-Ogaryovo was outfitted in June 2020 with a special disinfection tunnel that all visitors had to pass through in order to visit him and news reports in September 2020 suggested the Russian leader lived in a ""virus-free bubble"" created by his security forces. ""His seclusion and inaccessibility, his deep belief that Russian domination over Ukraine must be restored and his decision to surround himself with ideologues and sycophants have all helped to bring Europe to its most dangerous moment since World War II,"" Zygar wrote.

3/11/2022,"(Updates with Blinken quotes, details, background) By Humeyra Pamuk and Daphne Psaledakis WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected every off-ramp offered by the United States to de-escalate the conflict in Ukraine and has, on the contrary, stepped up his military campaign, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday. ""We've sought to provide possible off-ramps to President Putin. He's the only one who can decide whether or not to take them. So far, every time there's been an opportunity to do just that, he's pressed the accelerator and continued down this horrific road that he's been pursuing,"" Blinken said at a joint news conference with his British counterpart Liz Truss. ""He has a clear plan right now to brutalize Ukraine but to what end?"" Blinken said, adding that Ukrainians have shown that they would not accept any ""puppet regime"" that Putin might try to install to replace the elected Ukrainian government. ""If he tries to enforce such a puppet regime by keeping Russian forces in Ukraine, it will be a long, bloody, drawn-out mess,"" Blinken said. Senior U.S. defense officials last month assessed that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is designed to 'decapitate' Ukraine's government. More than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since Putin launched the land, sea and air invasion on Feb 24. Moscow calls its action a ""special military operation"" to disarm its neighbor and dislodge leaders it calls ""neo-Nazis."" The war has swiftly cast Russia into economic isolation as well as drawing almost universal international condemnation. The United States on Tuesday banned imports of Russian oil, while Western companies are rapidly pulling out of the Russian market. Russian forces hold territory stretching along Ukraine's northeast border, the east and the southeast. Fighting has taken place in the outskirts of the capital Kyiv, while Ukraine's second city Kharkiv is under bombardment. Blinken has also slammed Russia for not allowing safe passage to civilians stuck in cities under heavy bombardment. ""The Kremlin's proposals to create humanitarian corridors leading into Russia and Belarus are absurd,"" he said. Russia earlier this week had offered Ukrainians escape routes to Russia and its close ally Belarus, a proposal that a spokesperson for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said was ""completely immoral.""
