3/25/2022,"It is tradition that politicians’ relatability is measured by knowing the price of a pint of milk. Which, I’m guessing, will be circa £9.80 in a couple of weeks’ time. Margaret Thatcher was very proud of being able to answer this question, an aptitude somewhat undermined by her nicking it all later. The problem with having recent governments packed with millionaires (at one point it was two-thirds of the cabinet) is that, even if they could answer this question with certainty, it wouldn’t detract from the fact they have zero idea what budgeting and financial constraints are like for most of the public. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, as a prime example, married into an absurd amount of money; think of him as a sort of Austen heroine in a Supreme hoodie. His wife, Akshata Murthy, the daughter of a billionaire, is said to be richer than the Queen. On Wednesday morning Sunak was asked awkward questions as to whether his family was benefiting from connections to Russian businesses, hours after saying connections to Russian businesses were bad. Which reminded me of when Katie Hopkins said naming kids after places was gross, before being reminded that her daughter was called India. Earlier, the chancellor had been mercilessly mocked for pretending that he owned a Kia Rio, and filling it up at a Sainsbury’s petrol station to show off the fact he had cut 5p off a litre of fuel to help “hard-pressed” motorists, who, forgive me, do not currently seem the most in need. Perhaps even more mortifying, poor Rishi (I use the word poor metaphorically) managed to bungle his payment by – swear down – tapping his contactless card to a barcode scanner. This has to be the greatest failure of a millionaire politician struggling to deal with the rudimentary tasks of everyday living since Jeremy Hunt pulled an emergency stop cord on a train thinking that it flushed the loo. All of this brings us to Sunak’s spring statement. The papers are unanimous in their brutal criticism of a mini-budget that crushes the poorest people in society (no!? This government?! Get outta here!). With energy bills also set to rise by 54% next month, I doubt I will be the only one donning every item of clothing I own, a la Joey from Friends piling on Chandler’s entire wardrobe. The interesting thing is whether this will be the moment Brand Rishi falters. Surely, his slick social media presence will be unable to cut it in the face of 69% of respondents to a YouGov poll saying he had not done enough. For the past 18 months, Sunak has come to prominence aided by interns who learned how to use the layering tool in Photoshop, and created graphics that look like announcements that their boss is playing a residency at the Ministry of Sound. The entire Treasury has developed a startup air, which will never not be a super cringe move for any government department (Steve Hilton is right there as a cautionary tale, guys). I’m not sure that, when the nickname “Dishy Rishi” was coined (off the back of the second*-youngest chancellor in a century being moderately good-looking), many of us could have foreseen him, maskless, indoors, holding an actual dish, pretending to work in a Wagamama under his “eat out to help out” scheme – a name surely cooked up during a focus group with Benny Hill fans. (*The youngest chancellor in a century was George Osborne, which is difficult to comprehend because, even at the age of 38, he often had the vibe of the undead.) Especially strange was when Sunak put an “eat out to help out” sticker in the window of No 11, as though his own home were participating in the scheme; although I suppose it is pretty much cocktail hour 24/7 next door, so perhaps he got confused. In the end, the scheme increased footfall by 5%, but also increased Covid infections by up to 17%, and millions were lost to fraud. So who’s to say really whether it was a good idea? Sunak was praised for the billions spent on Covid mitigation measures, which would have been fine if he hadn’t shafted freelancers and gig economy workers, and messed about with the furlough deadline to the point where thousands of people lost their jobs, only for him to reverse course literally five hours before it hit. All the while, the photo ops keep coming. Here is Sunak standing in front of a bank of screens, which I imagine he thinks makes him look purposeful and in charge, but actually looks like a still from Squid Game. Then there is Suave Sunak, as witnessed here. Which is, unfortunately for him, giving off strong Harry Maguire chatting up those girls at the World Cup energy. To wit: On the subject of football, Sunak likes to think of himself as a chilled-out kind of guy, so it made sense when he and Boris Johnson organised the below pic session around a foosball table (with strategically placed hand sanitiser). Johnson, of course, is a sporty kind of man, well known for jogging in dress shoes; taking out children on the rugby pitch; and thinking it fine to boo the England football team. The only thing I really know about Sunak’s sporting life is that he supports Southampton FC, and that one time he took part in some kind of boxing event – “delivering a punchy message” about exercise – and was photographed smiling while about to be kicked in the chest. His love of sporting apparel, however, extends beyond tracksuit bottoms and hoodies, which once led to the BBC’s great Naga Munchetty deeming his favourite pool sliders “awful”. I’m all for jogging bottoms and sliders – mostly because I haven’t been outside in two and a half years – and I am actually in favour of politicians dressing more casually in general, but, as with Emmanuel Macron last week, the contrived attempt at edginess is palpable. And the plastic charm bracelet worn by Sunak when delivering last October’s budget was a step too far. Part Alex Garland writing The Beach, part children’s after-school activity, it was the most awkward piece of jewellery since Theresa May wore a bangle of the famously communist Frida Kahlo. None of this cool, down-to-earth Rishi shtick really washes when you’re a man in a £795 jacket plunging 1.3 million people into poverty, and families are declining potatoes from food banks because they can’t afford the energy to cook them. When 2.5 million food parcels a year are given out in the UK, Sunak’s entire spring statement could be summed up thus: let them eat caviar.

3/25/2022,"At 3.50am on the cold morning of 24 February, Iryna Prudkova, 50, received a message on Telegram from her 24-year-old daughter, Valeria, who lives in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. “Are you listening to Putin?,” Valeria’s message read. “That’s totally fucked up. There is a special military operation”. At 4.08am Valeria messaged once more: “Mum, Kyiv is being shelled.” Sitting in her small flat on the first floor of a nine-storey apartment block in the leafy Kirovsky residential area of Mariupol, a port city on the Azov Sea, whose name has now passed into infamy, Iryna knew what she had to do. She had already packed a small carry bag containing money, some jewellery to potentially trade for food and shelter, and family documents. Her husband, Alexandr, 46, argued that morning that they could stay a day or two more to sort out their affairs. “I told him, ‘We have to leave, it is the last chance’.” As Iryna hastily packed a suitcase, Alexandr took their Mercedes W212 to fill it with petrol at the Western Oil group station at the back of the apartment block. A long line of cars had got there first. As Alexandr waited nervously, the night sky suddenly lit up with a deafening thunder, a noise unfamiliar even in a city close to the frontline of the eight-year battle battle between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in Donestsk and Luhansk. The war had taken its grip of Mariupol – and it has yet to let go. This is a story, based on diary entries and interviews with those who have survived an unthinkable trial of endurance, of a swift and brutal destruction of a city in which the best and worst of humanity was on show. It is an ongoing story full of death, misery and heartache documented and told through tears. As Iryna and Alexandr, along with his parents, a niece and her two-year-old son, drove north at pace from Mariupol on the Volodarskaya motorway, Nadiia Sukhorukova, 51, a journalist, was asleep in her apartment just over a mile north in the city’s centre. “Even through a dream, I heard booms and explosions,” she wrote in her diary. “And then the editor, Galia, sent a message to the group chat, ‘That’s it guys, get up!’” At 8.23am, the mayor of Mariupol addressed his city on television. He urged everyone to remain calm. “Due to the current situation in the city, the work of schools, kindergartens and other social infrastructure institutions, except for hospitals and healthcare centre, has been temporarily stopped,”Vadym Boichenko said. “We also open all shelters in the city. All utilities and public transport continue to operate.” Within 20 minutes, seven buildings in Mariupol’s left bank were engulfed in fire after Russian shelling that took a day to put out, killing four people, including a child. More shelling followed at 3.17pm. Three hours later, instructions as how to act under fire were published and the rules of a new curfew between 10pm and 6am were imposed. An additional train service was put on for those who wanted to leave. Across the city, people were frantically checking roofs for “tags” after hearing that the Russians had earmarked buildings with signs so their jets could zone in on the targets. Nadiia wrote that evening: “In the morning my brother’s wife was gathering my little nephews to the sound of gunfire. They were afraid and tried to act up. “Children sat in the corridor on stools in jackets and caps with huge packages in their hands. These are their ‘emergency cases’. “At my feet lay the kindest dog in the world, which was also very scared. Together they left the huge high-rise building for the basement of a private house. It is safer there during the shelling. They are afraid to return home.” By the next crisp morning, many in Mariupol woke to find their electricity had been cut. By the end of the day about 40,000 were living in the dark. Power lines on the city’s left bank had been damaged. Officials were adamant it was a temporary glitch. The council also decided to take water from a reservoir due to the main supply from Siverski Donets river having been cut. At 8.17pm, a Russian missile hit a school. It was empty. At 7am the next day, the council again assured the population that all would be well and trams and buses were operating as normal. Four hours later, public transport was “temporarily stopped” for public safety. The village of Sartana, a few miles north-east of Mariupol, was being heavily shelled. Boichenko’s tone changed. The attacks were a “crime against humanity”. Everything was being done that could be done to keep the lights and heating on. By the next morning, the internet was down. People on the Viber messaging service received anonymous messages, most likely from Russian hackers, informing them that all communications would soon be severed. Residents in Sartana were evacuated from their homes to what they believed was the relative safety of Mariupol. By noon, there were reports of direct fire on civilians. Bombs rained down on apartment blocks on the central Peremohy Avenue and Horlivska Street. At 2.26pm that day a fateful announcement was made – the Donetsk Regional Drama Theatre was opening as a shelter. By 9.35pm the council had to deny that Mariupol would soon be without water. Curfew was extended and saboteurs were being arrested. Reports of looting proliferated. The city was collapsing into disorder. “The military, territorial defence and law enforcement will act as harshly as required by wartime,” Boichenko said. “Marauders and saboteurs will be eliminated on the spot.” On 28 February, Nadiia wrote: “In the house we have no shelter, and those that are, are very far away. We just can’t get there. Therefore, during the shelling, the common corridor turns into Noah’s ark. Together with people, a cat, two dogs, a guinea pig – a local favourite and an impudent hamster are sitting out a terrible time. “There is absolute unity in the corridor, even among those neighbours who could not stand each other before. “One hundred per cent mutual understanding among those who were indignant that animals shit on the street. Now don’t care. Our Ukrainian cats and dogs are just perfect.” By 1 March, the shelling was constant, a suffocating blanket of noise and fear. “We walked the dog under shelling and took a picture of my mother’s snowdrops in the yard. Spring came,” Nadiia wrote. But the tension was wearing. “I want to sleep all the time. Constantly. As if a sleepy elephant had moved into me. I nod, even during terrible shelling.” That day everyone was ordered to turn off boilers, refrigerators, electric stoves, kettles, air conditioners and heaters to allow lights to remain on. The traffic lights were switched off. “The light is interrupted, there is no water, no heat either,” Nadiia wrote. “Dead silence in Mariupol. The city seemed to be in shambles. Raindrops are pounding on the windowsill.” There were 14 hours of uninterrupted shelling on 2 March from truck-mounted multiple rocket launchers, mortars, howitzers and initially single-seat, twin-engine jet aircraft, before the Kremlin turned to low-flying SU-24 attack jets, a supersonic, all-weather Soviet plane. They struck the maternity hospital and apartment blocks. It was, the mayor said, the “hardest and most brutal day”. Mariupol’s lights would not go on again. On 5 March, a humanitarian corridor was seemingly agreed. People could leave in their cars. Along the way the Russians mockingly peppered those fleeing with artillery shells in the Zaporizhia region, north-west of the city. Those hopeful of escape were told to run back to shelter. The same happened the following day. And again, and again. By 7 March, Mariupol received that most unwelcome of garlands, being named a “hero city” by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. No streets were intact. Bodies littered the ground, unburied and rotting among the ash, glass, plastic and metal fragments. Blank eyes staring back at horrified children. “One woman had her arm, leg and head torn off,” Nadiia wrote. “I’m sure I’ll die soon. It’s a matter of days. In this city, everyone is constantly waiting for death. I just wish it wasn’t so scary.” Families hunkered in city centre basements were left to drink water from puddles or collect dribbles from drainpipes, and share scraps of food rescue from burnt-out homes. The only salvation being volunteers who filled barrels from a canal with dirty water to distribute from basement to basement. On 8 March, a six-year-old child died in Mariupol of dehydration. She had been buried under the rubble that killed her mother and was discovered too late. The next day, the children’s hospital was bombed. The civilian death toll was officially 1,207 but as if to mock the pretence that this was close to the dreadful truth, a Russian pilot dropped a bomb on the theatre, used as a shelter by 1,300 people, and clearly marked to those above by the word “children” painted in white on either side. About 1,000 of those were under the stage of the theatre. Despite every effort, nothing has been heard of them since. Only those elsewhere in the vast building were able to stagger out, some holding their limp children in their arms. The council said on Friday that at least 300 people had died as a video emerged of the carnage inside immediately after the strike. Mikhail Vershinin, the head of patrol police department in the Donetsk region, told the Guardian: “We were some 200 metres from it, there was an airstrike and a massive explosion, and another large explosion … We were going along an adjacent street and we didn’t know the theatre had been hit. “One of my troops witnessed what happened just after the explosion. He saw people carrying their children covered in blood. It hit him really hard, and he was unable to perform his duties when he saw it. He broke down.” Nadiia, by now bombed out of her home and surviving along with nephews and nieces in a basement below a block in the city centre, could no longer venture out to walk the dog. “I opened the entrance door, pushed the dog out and watched in doom as she first ran down the stairs, trying to find a place among the fragments on the scorched earth, then the big-eared one squatted but then a close mine squeaked disgustingly and exploded and she ran back. We waited a minute and started again. I stood in the doorway and cried.” On 14 March, she wrote of the bittersweet emotions as some in the shelter made the decision to risk escape. “Next to us was a family – an adult son and his elderly mother. They were very calm and reserved, they treated our children with sweets and cookies, they gave us butter and lard, because they were going to leave. “Our children were so scared that they hardly ate anything. But sweets and cookies were devoured immediately. It was a real treasure and a little joy in a gloomy dungeon buzzing with explosions. They even had fun. “For the first time since the beginning of the war, seven-year-old Varya asked me to tell her about Peppa Pig and even believed me when I promised to buy her any doll as soon as we left the basement. The little one only clarified: ‘The stores robbed everyone, how will you buy me?” I replied that not a single toy store was touched and all the dolls were in place. I looked at her round face, matted hair, small nose, neck wrapped in a scarf and thought: ‘What if I’m deceiving her?’ I kissed her cheeks and dirty hands, and my heart skipped a beat with pain. I wasn’t sure we’d make it through tonight. Nadiia went on: “Her brother Cyril barely spoke to us. He was very scared when we were in another basement in a private house and there was a direct hit on the roof. The roof caught fire and everyone had to leave. We fled to the garage under terrible fire. Around everything howled and exploded, and Cyril shouted: ‘Mummy, please, Mummy! I want to live! I don’t want to die!’” Ukrainian troops are outnumbered by five to one in Mariupol and the husk that is left of the city is likely to fall in days. About 100,000 civilians remain. Back in February, at the start of the war, it had taken Iryna three days to reach the relative safety of the western city of Lviv. She has since been helping to organise escapes. Some get through. Others not. Two women escorting eight children, aged one to eight, went missing four days ago. “My neighbour said God had left Mariupol,” wrote Nadiia on 18 March. “He was afraid of everything he saw.” The following day, she and her son risked the Russian artillery to escape for Odesa, 600 miles west on the Black Sea, where Russian warships also prowl. “I keep telling myself that I’m not in hell any more, but I keep hearing planes roar, startle at any loud sound, and pull my head into my shoulders,” she wrote. “I’m scared when someone leaves. There, in hell, not everyone who left returned.”",News/World news,‘God has left Mariupol’: diary entries chart horror of besieged city in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/mariupol-diary-entries-besieged-ukraine
3/25/2022,"Transport group Go-Ahead has been awarded a new contract to run Britain’s biggest commuter rail network – a week after being fined £23.5m for wrongly withholding £50m of taxpayers’ money on another franchise. Unions said it was a “sick joke” that the group’s Govia joint venture was given a three-year deal to continue running the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise, which served about a million passengers daily pre-Covid. Govia, a joint venture led by Go-Ahead with French firm Keolis, was stripped of the Southeastern franchise last September for “breaches of good faith”. The firm’s £23.5m fine from the Department for Transport for failings on Southeastern was less than the £30m it had set aside. Go-Ahead’s share price has risen 20% in the last week on the smaller fine and rumours of a fresh award. The group’s chief financial officer, Elodie Brian, who was chief financial officer at Southeastern during the period where most breaches occurred, from 2014-19, quit last October as the scandal emerged. Go-Ahead’s chief executive David Brown also stepped down. Investigations since found more irregularities at Southeastern, dating back to 2006. Go-Ahead eventually repaid £51.3m, including interest, of the money it had wrongly withheld in overpayments from the DfT. The case has been referred to the Serious Fraud Office. Although senior directors worked at both franchises, an investigation led by the chairs of Go-Ahead and Keolis found no evidence that any similar accounting issues existed at Govia Thameslink Railway as Southeastern. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: “Shapps has done this having been reassured that Go-Ahead are safe with public money on the strength of a report conducted by the same people who ripped off the public in the first place. “This was a totally unnecessary decision, driven by an ideological fixation with greed and profit because the operator of last resort, which picked up the wreckage of Govia’s Southeastern franchise, was ready and waiting to take over and run it in the public sector.” TSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes said the move “beggars belief”, adding: “Shapps is throwing good money after bad.” The new contract starts on 1 April 2022 and will run for at least three years, with a possible three-year extension. Go-Ahead is the last British private firm running a UK rail network, with the state-run Operator of Last Resort now in charge at Northern and LNER as well as Southeastern. The deal is a management contract which, unlike franchises, has no cost risk to the operator. Govia Thameslink Railway, or GTR, will earn a fixed fee of £8.8m per year and up to £22.9m on top if it meets performance targets. The £31.7m maximum is equivalent to a margin of around 1.85%, Go-Ahead said. Rail minister Wendy Morton said: “With their plans for improving the punctuality, reliability and accessibility of their services through close collaboration with Network Rail, we are proud to partner with GTR to create a truly passenger focused service.” Christian Schreyer, chief executive of Go-Ahead, said: “A top priority is to build passenger numbers back after the COVID-19 pandemic. Go-Ahead will bring commercial acumen and international experience to bear in encouraging people back to the railways.”",News/Business,New rail contract award to Go-Ahead branded ‘a sick joke’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/25/new-rail-contract-award-go-ahead-branded-sick-joke-thameslink-southern-great-northern-
3/25/2022,"I’m in a relationship with a man who is separated from his wife but not divorced. He left her five years ago and says their marriage had been over long before that, but he decided to stay until his children left home. We are both in our 50s and his children are now young adults. I was divorced in my 40s and have no children. We live separately. We’ve had a very happy relationship for several years, but there has always been the elephant in the room of his marriage and the block it presents to our planning a future together. He has made some moves towards a divorce – contacting a solicitor and gathering information about his finances – but as far as I know, has done nothing beyond that. It’s difficult for me to understand: my own divorce was done, start to finish, in six months. Of course his circumstances are more complicated, but he seems unable to face the emotional and financial consequences – particularly as his wife has never worked much, which was a source of conflict. I know this will be hard but procrastination will make it worse as they both get closer to retirement age, with fewer opportunities for him to rebuild his finances. I hate the prospect of losing what has been the best relationship of my life but I can’t play second fiddle to his wife, legally if in no other way, indefinitely. Do I have to walk away? You don’t have to walk away from “the best relationship in your life” without a great deal of thought. But it’s important to be honest with yourself: what is it you want and what are you afraid of? Sometimes in relationships the obvious problems – the “headlines” – are red herrings, and even if they are removed, the niggling feeling that things aren’t right remains. So is him not getting divorced (which, don’t get me wrong, is a biggie!) a symptom of something else about him – his inability to put you first, perhaps – that you don’t like, or does it stand alone? I wonder what he, too, is afraid of? I hear from divorce lawyers that it’s often men who separate but don’t get divorced, and it may be for myriad reasons – among them a sense of shame, which may come from childhood experiences. Maybe your partner promised never to “leave” his wife and, as long as he doesn’t sign those papers, in a way he won’t. He may fear abandoning her financially. It does sound, from what you say, that this is a sticking point. Or he could just be lazy; divorce can be a lot of paperwork. The situation may suit his ex, too. I spoke to solicitor Gary Rycroft from Joseph A Jones & Co. He pointed out that from 6 April the law on divorce will change, with the abolishment of the need for blame to be apportioned to one party. Could this be a catalyst for your partner? If that still doesn’t work, Rycroft suggested your partner and his ex could “tidy up” the legal side of their marriage by getting a “deed of separation”. This can be “totally bespoke” so they can put in it what they feel comfortable with. So they could say neither will make any claims against the other at this time, or they could start to outline a division of assets. I wonder if this might be a good dress rehearsal for him. Consider going to couples counselling, too (psychotherapy.org.uk; cosrt.org.uk; bacp.co.uk).

3/25/2022,"Most of us will never go to the Oscars, never wear an haute-couture dress, never have an opportunity to oh-so-humbly thank a “glam squad” – or indeed, even to really know what a glam squad is. So it’s baffling that we care so much what actors wear on the red carpet. But care we do.OK, I care. But I’m not alone, or it wouldn’t be the case that a knockout dress can get you on as many front pages as winning the golden statuette. I think it’s because the red carpet is where film stars are at their most starry. Being a film star is not the same as being an actor, not at all. Acting is about becoming a different person; stardom is about becoming something bigger, a rare and magical creature who we gaze at – mum, LOOK! – as bewitched as if we were in the presence of a snow leopard or giant panda. And the red carpet is the landscape where this pride of majestic lions of the Hollywood hills strut their animal magic. In other words, red carpet fashion is about what to wear when people are looking at you. This is an area where many of us feel a little rusty just now. It’s not that we’ve all turned into hermits, but even when we have been free to hang out, blockbuster parties have been hard to come by. And now it’s back. That thing where you’re going to walk into a room, and people you have never met are going to start to form an opinion of you before you’ve said a word. A fashion editor friend of mine from another newspaper has a brilliant take on this. When you are picking what to wear to a party, she says, think about what impression of your personality you’d like to convey when you walk into the room. Your personality, not your appearance – that’s the point. Maybe you want them to think you look interesting. Or fun. Or sophisticated. Or wild. Which is it? Because those are very different dresses, and that’s a very different rubric from thinking about which will make you look thin. Film stars do exactly this. Angelina Jolie always looks dangerous. Jennifer Lawrence pretty much made adorable her middle name. Tilda Swinton nails avant garde. And you only have to look at Zoë Kravitz once to know she’s cool. On the red carpet, this is a high-stakes celebrity game that could win you a million-dollar perfume contract if you play your cards right. But it’s way more fun to play the same game on a civilian scale. You don’t have to stay on-brand, for a start. One night you might be feeling high-energy and up for anything. So you choose an outfit that makes all the other high-energy, up-for-anything people in the room rush over to you and scream over your swan dress, or whatever. On another occasion you might want to give out a quieter, more grown-up energy, and so wear something by which people who just want a nice glass of wine and a quiet spot near the snacks for people-watching can identify you as a kindred spirit. People who wear bright prints love to talk, in my experience. So if you’re feeling super chatty, go with a print. On the other hand, if you’re not in the mood for small talk, ivory silk is helpful for encouraging people to keep their distance – in case they spill a drink on you. The Oscars red carpet will be, as always, a masterclass in how to project yourself larger-than-life to an audience. Next time you’re getting ready to go out, give it a whirl. As they say in Hollywood: you can be anyone you want to be.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Movie stars project themselves as rare and magical at the Oscars.

3/25/2022,"The puritan in me is always slightly shocked to see holidaymakers at the airport downing pints of lager at 9am, and I feel a bit the same way about brunch, unless it starts at midday. Why would anyone want to drink so early? I guess that’s what prosecco is made for. It’s low in alcohol, it goes with sweet as well as savoury food (it has a higher level of residual sugar than other sparkling wines) and it’s almost universally popular. The only thing against the stuff is that it’s such an obvious choice. If that’s likely to bother you – and you might well say, why would it at the price? – there’s always other fizz such as cava, crémant and, of course, champagne (which, by the way, goes extraordinarily well with croissants – go on, try it). It’s worth bearing in mind, though, that brunch dishes are much more flavourful than they once were, particularly those created by my ever-inventive Guardian colleagues and which are more than likely to include spices, chilli or a punchy salsa. Dishes such as Turkish eggs with garlic, yoghurt and aleppo pepper or the ubiquitous avocado toast are more like a lunch dish than a breakfast one, anyway, and rub along quite happily with a still wine. My go-tos would include a crowd-pleasing Provence rosé such as the Roseline in today’s pick and New Zealand (or similar) styles of sauvignon blanc, which, despite the current shortages Down Under, you can still get hold of at a reasonable price. South Africa, especially, has stepped in to fill the gap: the Journey’s End Spekboom below in today’s pick is a real bargain at this introductory price. Cocktails, too, work really well at that time of the morning, the bloody mary, of course, being the classic brunch choice. If the numbers aren’t huge, buy a bottle of my new favourite spiced tomato juice, Tongue in Peat (£4.89 for 50cl drinksupermarket.com, or direct from the website for £14.39 for 3 x 50cl bottles), which is flavoured with Islay peat. It’s just as good without vodka as it is with. I’d love to be able to say I’ve tracked down a decent alcohol-free fizz, but it still eludes me. I was going to recommend a rather cool-looking product called Wild Idol, until I discovered it costs a staggering £35, even though it’s not subject to the same duty as champagne. Even for your mum, that’s really taking the proverbial. Fortunately there are some fancily bottled alcohol-free spirits around, such as Atopia and Sipsmith’s Freeglider, either of which would make a good-looking gift. Sorso Prosecco £6.49, Morrisons, 11%. A cool-looking bottle that belies the modest price. Ideal for a crowd. Mirabeau La Folie Sparkling Rosé £14 (or £11 on Clubcard) Tesco, £14.99 Waitrose and Majestic (on the “mix six” deal), 12.5%. You get the best of both worlds with this really classy sparkler: Provence rosé + bubbles. Roseline Côtes de Provence Rosé 2020 £15 (or £12 on Clubcard) Tesco, 13%.

3/25/2022,"This weekend’s Oscars come to us soggy and shorn of spectacle. Covid meant that the nominees couldn’t all have their photo taken together, plus the lack of a televised Golden Globes has sapped awards season of all momentum. But at least one time-honoured scrap of Oscars tradition has remained undimmed: the anonymous ballot. A mainstay of contemporary awards hype, this is where a voting member of the academy will dash off to one website or another under the cloak of anonymity in the runup to the Oscars so that they can be extraordinarily bitchy about all the films they didn’t like. And while this is often good fun, they do also provide the tiniest insight into which way the winds might blow on Sunday night. Here’s what we’ve been able to glean from all of this year’s assorted moles. Almost unanimously, this is the most concrete prediction, with Coda’s breakout star winning voters over in droves. Indiewire’s voters called him “incredible”, and stated that his victory “will be an historical win”. Four of the five voters who spoke to Gold Derby also went with Kotsur, with one calling their vote a “no-brainer”. The voters who spoke to the Hollywood Reporter praised his ability to “move a non-deaf audience to tears”, with another adding: “I just want to see the guy up there.” However, his win won’t be a complete landslide. While three of the five voters who spoke to Entertainment Weekly picked Kotsur, the other two opted for Kodi Smit-McPhee or, as one anonymous director called him, “the gay kid in Power of the Dog”. A couple of weeks ago, The Power of the Dog’s Oscar victory seemed all but guaranteed. However, if you believe the anonymous voters, that respect is largely begrudging. Genuine praise was thin on the ground, with one of Gold Derby’s voters cooing: “All the actors in this movie are amazing!” The rest of the responses ranged from measured (Indiewire’s voter sighed: “Jane Campion will win and I don’t think anybody is going to be mad about that”) to actively hostile. The Hollywood Reporter’s voter called it “too long” and “really dull”, while Entertainment Weekly’s just said: “I was like, ugh, enough.” This category seems like a much tighter race but, on this evidence alone, Smith might just nudge it. Of the 15 voters who spoke to various publications, six of them went Smith’s way. If you’re counting, Andrew Garfield and Benedict Cumberbatch got four votes each and Denzel Washington got one. Javier Bardem, on the other hand, received no love at all. Again, going by the numbers, this category is going Cruz’s way. Eight voters named her as their pick, leaving the other nominees in their wake. Kristen Stewart picked up just three nods, while Olivia Colman and Jessica Chastain could only scrape together two, the consensus about the latter being that her performance propped up a terrible film. But wait, aren’t there five nominees in this category? Yes, I’m glad you brought that up. Only one voter went out of their way to single out Kidman’s performance in Being the Ricardos, and not for a reason she’ll probably want to hear. “I can’t get over her botoxed face,” the voter (a costume designer), told Indiewire, before adding: “I wish they had cast somebody less plastic looking.” At the end of their screed, the voter stated: “She’s done a Cher; she can no longer be seen on the big screen.” Although Don’t Look Up has become the film that everyone loves dunking on, the movie most likely to crawl away with its tail between its legs is Being the Ricardos. Aaron Sorkin’s film was already cut out of the best picture, best director and best original screenplay categories, but the voters clearly have no love for the three nominated performances. Aside from the Kidman outburst, the director who spoke to Entertainment Weekly said of Bardem’s performance: “No. Absolutely not. No way … Like, what the fuck? Why are these guys nominated?” Meanwhile, one of the Hollywood Reporter’s voters said that “he’s too old, he’s too thick and he’s not funny enough”.",Arts/Film,What can we learn from this year’s honest Oscars ballots?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/25/anonymous-oscars-ballots-academy-awards
3/25/2022,"A Nebraska congressman has been found guilty of three felonies for lying to the FBI about illegal campaign contributions from a foreign billionaire. A federal jury in Los Angeles convicted Jeff Fortenberry, a nine-term Republican, on Thursday of concealing information and two counts of providing false statements to authorities. He denied to federal authorities that he was aware of illegal campaign donations from Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian billionaire of Lebanese descent who disguised his identity through third-party contributions, said the US attorney’s office for the central district of California. According to court documents reviewed by the Washington Post, Chagoury was accused of making illicit campaign contributions worth up to $180,000 to four American political candidates, including Fortenberry. One of Chagoury’s associates gave $30,000 to “an individual at a restaurant in Los Angeles, who, along with others, later made campaign contributions” to Fortenberry’s re-election campaign, according to officials. Chagoury had connections to Defense of Christians, a nonprofit that combated the persecution of Christians and other minorities in the Middle East, court documents revealed. He attempted to funnel money to “politicians from less-populous states because the contribution would be more noticeable to the politician and thereby would promote increased donor access,” said federal prosecutors. Fortenberry has maintained his innocence. In a YouTube video filmed with his wife and dog, he said “a person from overseas illegally moved money to my campaign” and he “didn’t know anything about this”. “I feel so personally betrayed … We thought we were trying to help,” Fortenberry said. His attorneys accused federal agents of setting him up. Fortenberry’s sentencing is set for 28 June. Each count carries up to five years of federal prison time, along with fines. Fortenberry said the court process had been unfair and that he would immediately appeal. “After learning of illegal contributions to his campaign, the congressman repeatedly chose to conceal the violations of federal law to protect his job, his reputation and his close associates,” said US attorney Tracy L Wilkison in a statement. “The lies in this case threatened the integrity of the American electoral system and were designed to prevent investigators from learning the true source of campaign funds.”",News/US news,US congressman convicted of lying to FBI in campaign funds case,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/25/republican-congressman-jeff-fortenberry-found-guilty
3/25/2022,"Last week it summarily sacked 786 crew working on ships sailing from UK ports, telling them that this was their last day in employment and that they would be replaced by new crew brought in by a third party.Ministers expressed their immediate outrage – but have not yet followed up with any action. Yes – but possibly not as illegal as you might think. There are two specific areas where P&O clearly admits to have flouted employment law, but neither necessarily lead to sanctions from the UK government. Ministers are currently taking advice from the Insolvency Service on possible action. Despite the prime minister claiming that P&O Ferries would be prosecuted under section 194 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act of 1992, no action has yet been taken. An employer has a) to give 45 days notice to the relevant authorities when planning to make significant redundancies, and b) to consult the workforce, normally via unions. On point a), P&O Ferries argues that it did not have to notify the UK government since an amendment to the law in 2018 – and it didn’t. However, it also admits it did not give notice, as legally required, to the flag states for its ships, which are registered in Cyprus, Bermuda and the Bahamas. The three flag states, which under international maritime law regulate the ships, require 30-45 days notice but were only told of P&O’s plans on the day. Given the long history of flag states being unable to police crimes onboard ships in international waters, any intervention or sanction appears unlikely. P&O Ferries admits it deliberately broke the law. In astonishingly candid testimony to MPs this week, chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite said: “There’s absolutely no doubt we were required to consult with the unions. We chose not to do that.” Because it was cheaper to break the law and take any potential fine – if indeed, one comes. Hebblethwaite said unions would not accept the changes and therefore P&O Ferries would give higher payoffs to sacked crew, effectively more than crew could win from tribunals despite their illegal treatment. The firm also demanded crew accept swiftly without discussion or lose the offer. Hebblethwaite said the action was to “save the company”, which was losing money, and admitted it would halve crew costs. Replacement crew will work different schedules than agreed with unions, allowing fewer overall staff, and be paid an hourly rate starting at £5.15 via a new agency abroad rather than an average £36,000 a year to those sacked from the Jersey agency. The maritime minister, Robert Courts, suggested that ministers are constrained by the law. However, other MPs pointed out that parliament’s role is to pass new law, and urged emergency legislation. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, pledged new legislation next week to force the company to pay workers minimum wage on all routes – currently P&O say they will only do so when sailing between two UK ports, namely on its route between Northern Ireland and Scotland. No. About 600 people employed by P&O Ferries recruitment divisions in Calais and Rotterdam, on French and Dutch contracts, remain in work.

3/25/2022,"William Haggas’s Mujtaba, the likely favourite for Saturday’s Lincoln Handicap at Doncaster, is a lightly-raced four-year-old with the potential to be a Group-class performer before too long, which is very much the profile of recent winners of this historic handicap. That list includes Haggas’s Addeybb, who landed three Group Ones after winning on Town Moor in 2018, but while Mujtaba has obvious claims for this year’s renewal, several of his opponents arrive with similar records. Saleymm and Modern News, a half-brother to last year’s Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf winner, Modern Games, both have scope for significant improvement, while Darkness, who was campaigned in Group One company at two and has been gelded since joining David O’Meara from Jean-Claude Rouget over the winter, is another fascinating candidate. At the likely prices, though, the best option from among the lightly-raced four-year-olds is Rogue Bear (3.35) at around 20-1. Unraced at two, Tom Clover’s gelding won three of his five starts in 2021 and has crept in at the bottom of the weights on Saturday. He progressed from race-to-race last season, dead-heated in a useful time on his final start of the campaign and sets out on what promises to be a productive campaign just 2lb higher in the weights. Doncaster 1.15 Eve Johnson Houghton has a healthy level-stakes profit with juveniles on debut over the last five years, so it would be no great surprise if Blatant has been primed to repeat the stable’s Brocklesby win with Chipotle 12 months ago. Kelso 1.35 Son Of The Somme has just one win to show for his steady progress in four starts this season, but he was 15 lengths in front of the third horse home when touched off by a neck at Doncaster earlier this month. He is just 3lb higher here and Brian Ellison’s seven-year-old has scope for further improvement on just his eighth career start. Doncaster 1.50 A competitive renewal of this Listed sprint, but Diligent Harry, the best three-year-old sprinter on the all-weather last year, still has untapped potential on turf and Clive Cox is the ideal trainer to draw it out. Kempton 2.05 A 3lb penalty makes life a little more difficult for Fancy Man but Richard Hannon’s four-year-old has the best recent form – when third behind Alenquer and Group One-winner Lord North in the Winter Derby - and more scope for progress than most of these rivals. Doncaster 2.25 Star Shield has few secrets from the handicapper but he has been in the form of his life on the all-weather over the winter and is still feasibly weighted for his return to the turf. Kempton 2.40 Bandinelli, the likely favourite, and Moliwood arrive with similar profiles, having won over track and trip on their latest starts, and appeal as the two runners that are most likely to be a step in front of the handicapper. Marco Botti’s gelding, up just 2lb for his latest win and 5-1 in the early betting, makes more appeal at the prices.

3/25/2022,"Philip Pullman has stepped down as president of the Society of Authors (SoA) after comments he made about Kate Clanchy’s controversial memoir, Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me. In a letter sent to the SoA’s management committee this month, the children’s author said he “would not be free to express [his] personal opinion” as long as he remained in the role. Pullman, who will remain a member of the trade union’s council, came under fire last year when he spoke out in support of Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me, which was criticised for racial and ableist stereotyping. In response to a tweet that he incorrectly assumed was about Clanchy, Pullman, in a now-deleted tweet, said that those who criticised the book without reading it would “find a comfortable home in Isis or the Taliban”. The SoA released a statement at the time distancing itself from Pullman’s comments, and Pullman later tweeted an apology for the harm he caused, saying criticism of Clanchy was “reasonable and balanced” and that people of colour “deserve every kind of respect”. However, as the controversy around Clanchy continues – she and her publisher “parted ways” in January – Pullman clearly felt that he could no longer remain in his role. He said it had been “a privilege” to serve as president, and added: “Recent events have made it apparent that when a difference of opinion arises, there is no easy way to resolve it within the constitution or the established practices of the society. “When it became clear that statements of mine were being regarded as if they represented the views of the society as a whole (although they did nothing of the sort, and weren’t intended to), and that I was being pressed by people both in and out of the society to retract them and apologise, I realised that I would not be free to express my personal opinions as long as I remained president. That being the case, with great regret and after long consideration I chose to stand down.” Pullman told the SoA and its chief executive, Nicola Solomon, last month of his intention to resign. She said the society was “very sorry” when it received news of Pullman’s decision. Pullman has been a member of the SoA for 35 years, joining the children’s writers and illustrators group committee in 1991. His first five-year term as president began in 2013 and he was elected to a second term that was due to end in 2023. Solomon said: “During his nine years as president, the working landscape for authors of all kinds has continued to change almost beyond recognition”, highlighting the way social media has transformed communication. She said the organisation was planning to review its constitution to “reflect the times in which we live”, which may include changes to the role of president. She went on to praise the way Pullman had spoken out on “many issues that impact authors, including payment, libraries, independent bookshops, book piracy and book festivals – ensuring a far wider understanding of the issues facing authors than we could have achieved without him”. The author Joanne Harris, who is chair of the management committee at the SoA, said in a statement: “We are very sorry to see Philip resign. We thank Philip for his many years of service to the SoA, for his inspirational work with young readers.”",Arts/Books,‘I would not be free to express my opinion’: Philip Pullman steps down as Society of Authors president,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/25/i-would-not-be-free-to-express-my-opinion-philip-pullman-steps-down-as-society-of-authors-president
3/25/2022,"Yet another betting shop has appeared on one of Britain’s high streets, full of screwed-up betting slips, little pens, newspaper race cards and discarded sweet wrappers. A pile of unopened post suggests the place has been abandoned. So far, so depressing. But this bookie’s in Sunderland is different. Titled Ghost Shop, it is remarkable because everything down to the sticky carpet tiles, fire extinguishers and CCTV cameras has been made from glass. “I have always had a weird fascination with betting shops,” said Ryan Gander, an artist whose always eyecatching work has included an activity centre for zoo lions in Mexico City and marble replicas of dens he made with his then three-year-old daughter. “I like the beckoning doors of illicit sin that betting shops have,” he said. “They’re always covered – you never know what’s going on inside so there is all this mystery to them. And betting is such a daft addiction in so many ways.” Gander is a conceptual artist known for irreverent works, which often stop people in their tracks, and the betting shop ranks as one of his most ambitious projects. He estimates that curators say “it can’t be done” to about 90% of his wild ideas. When he proposed a derelict betting shop on the high street, the National Glass Centre in Sunderland said “yes” straight away. “I’ve never done anything with glass and I always like the next thing I do to be completely different to the last thing,” he said. The work might be seen as a comment on the decline of the British high street. It is also, said Gander, about how we never pay enough attention to dangers in plain sight – and glass was the perfect medium. He said: “We see betting shops but they are kind of invisible because we pay no attention to them. They just become deleted from our awareness. We cancel out other people’s problems with addictions … we just blank these things out. We make them transparent.” Gander is one of four contemporary artists commissioned by the National Glass Centre in Sunderland to make works that will be on display across the north-east of England until September. Another is Turner prize-nominated Monster Chetwynd, who has created glass dioramas of scenes from the lives of local saints St Bede and St Cuthbert. It includes the story of Cuthbert spending the night singing psalms in the freezing sea and emerging to bless otters on the beach. Chetwynd’s installation will be shown in the Galilee Chapel – home to Bede’s tomb – at Durham Cathedral. The other two artists in the Glass Exchange project are Pascale Marthine Tayou and Katie Paterson. The works are being made by artists and technicians skilled in the craft of glassmaking. Erin Dickson, a glass artist, has been involved in Gander’s project since October. It has been challenging but fun, she said, although Gander suggested it had been more like “a hundred days of hell”. The biggest object in the installation will be a glass full-size fixed odds betting terminal, based on the controversial slot machines that campaigners argue have been cataclysmic for problem gamblers. Gander is one of Britain’s leading conceptual artists but he is not expecting hordes of critics from London to visit what was once a tanning salon. “I suspect that 99% of people who engage with it will be people who don’t know they’re engaging with art and I think that is the best art,” he said. “The problem is, especially in Britain, art is still a stigma for most of the population unless you live in Islington, or have been to art school, or are from an affluent background. “Most people don’t want anything to do with art. It is just elitist, daft.” He hopes people will come across his piece and engage with it without thinking “oh … bloody poets”.",Arts/Art and design,Sunderland betting shop replica is a glass act,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/25/sunderland-replica-betting-shop-installation-glass-ryan-gander
