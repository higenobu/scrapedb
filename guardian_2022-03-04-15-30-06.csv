3/4/2022,"Australia’s biggest superannuation fund, the $260bn AustralianSuper, has committed to divesting its Russian assets, after the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, called for Australian funds to ditch Russian investments. The fund said that it had already begun selling Russian stocks, and since June last year had reduced its holdings to between $175m and $180m. Aussie previously held at least $305m worth of Russian assets, including shares in the country’s biggest bank, Sberbank, that were worth almost $140m but are now all but worthless due to sanctions introduced following the invasion of Ukraine last week that have destroyed its European business. Another large industry fund, the $76bn Hostplus, said it would also sell its remaining Russian assets, which it said were now just $10m, down from $19m earlier in the week. The moves come after the treasurer and the minister for superannuation, Jane Hume, said on Thursday night that it was their “strong expectation” that Australian super funds would divest from Russia and the prudential regulator indicated it would take no action against funds that did so. Also on Thursday, Russia was kicked out of a key index that fund managers use to guide their investments after index provider MSCI said the country’s market was “uninvestable”. Other large funds including Australia’s second biggest, Australian Retirement Trust, Aware, Rest and Cbus, as well as sovereign wealth fund the Future Fund and the New South Wales government fund, committed to dumping Russian assets earlier in the week. However, selling Russian stocks is much more difficult than usual because the Moscow stock exchange was closed this week and the country’s central bank has banned processing foreign sell orders. In a statement, Aussie Super said it was “deeply concerned about the events unfolding in Ukraine”. “AustralianSuper is in full compliance with all relevant sanctions and, in accordance with our portfolio management approach, has been actively managing our exposure to Russian assets to address changing and emerging risks. “Since June 2021 we have reduced the fund’s exposure to Russian investments by nearly two-thirds from 0.22% to about 0.07% of total assets. “We will continue winding down the remaining exposure to divest our holdings in Russia as markets permit.” The chief executive of Hostplus, David Elias, said the fund was “committed to fully divest our remaining direct holdings in Russia”. “We continue to work with our existing managers across our investment portfolios to achieve this outcome acknowledging that our ability is somewhat hampered by the Russian central bank ordering market brokers to reject foreign clients trying to sell Russian securities,” he said. “We certainly feel for the Ukrainian people and the terrible situation they’re facing and believe this is the right thing to do.”  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On Thursday night, Frydenberg and Hume said that even though super funds had little invested in Russia relative to Australia’s $3.5tn retirement savings pile, “it is important that Australia sends a clear and unequivocal signal that we condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine”. “The actions of Australia’s superannuation funds to divest of Russian assets will complement the range of sanctions imposed by the government to exert pressure on Russia, in alignment with our international partners,” the ministers said in a joint statement. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority said it noted the government’s position and “will not be taking any action against trustees who seek to divest Russian assets in this context where trustees have considered such divestments in accordance with their duties”. The regulator’s statements came after concerns were raised about how rules around funds’ duties to investors would apply to divestments for political reasons.",News/Australia news,Australia’s biggest superannuation fund commits to divesting Russian assets,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/04/australias-biggest-superannuation-fund-commits-to-divesting-russian-assets
3/4/2022,"Of all the true-life dramas that have made their way to our screens lately, Joe vs Carole (Peacock/Now TV) is the most perplexing. It is hard to see why it needed to be made, given that the sheer outrageousness of the Joe Exotic/Carole Baskin big cat feud already seen in Netflix’s bombastic documentary Tiger King (though this new show is based on a podcast, rather than that series). It is also hard to see how the makers would ever be able to shape a story so far-fetched that if it were not true, it would be beyond the realms of possibility to seem in any way believable. Yet here we are, with an eight-part drama that seems to have pulled it off. I say this cautiously, based on the first three episodes which were made available for review in advance. It is hugely entertaining, striking just the right tone, half absurd, half empathic, aware of its own limitations (those CGI wild animals would make the live-action Lion King blush) and playing up the flawed characters at the heart of it. But for all its extravagance and wildness, it may turn out to be more sensitive than the Netflix series. Saturday Night Live’s Kate McKinnon is Baskin, the woman with a troubled past who channels her energies into her big cat rescue sanctuary, all the while plotting to take down the big cat traders who appear troublingly prolific in the US. John Cameron Mitchell, of Hedwig and the Angry Inch and latterly The Good Fight, is Joe Exotic, a lost soul who finds his own kind of salvation in big cats, though his fork in the road takes him down a much darker path. Both are perfectly cast, and do well with a tough task. It would be easy for them to tip into parody, given that there is so much that lends itself to caricature about both characters. It takes a few moments to settle in (particularly for viewers aware of McKinnon’s sketch show past and skill as an impressionist) and then becomes more certain of itself. The choice was clearly made to avoid parody at all costs. This is a sensible move, which, in another strange revelation, turns out to be a quality the story sorely needed. For all of the operatic insanity, there are tragedies at the heart of it, and by the end of episode three this has to address them. The disappearance of Baskin’s husband, Don, and the arrival of Exotic’s young, doomed husband Travis, nudge their way in. These sombre events are handled less comfortably than the raucous ones, such as a drunken seduction or a thwarted carnival show. How it deals with those tragedies as they unfold remains to be seen. Its tone so far is more suited to energetic hijinks than it is to death and sorrow. For now though, it tries to find the humanity in the story and in the characters caught up in it. There is homophobia, domestic abuse, flashbacks to the cruelties that Exotic and Baskin endured. But there is also a sheep spray-painted to look like a tiger, a kiss with a camel and Exotic striding into a gay bar with a big cat on a chain, looking for love. Joe vs Carole is a lot to take in, as might have been expected. You can hardly call the source material understated. But it is bracing, fun and surprisingly measured. If the Tiger King saga has not lost its shine for you, there are worse ways to dip into its staggering twists and turns once more.",Arts/Television & radio,Joe vs Carole review – it’s Tiger King the drama … and it’s surprisingly sensitive,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/04/joe-vs-carole-review-its-tiger-king-the-drama-and-its-surprisingly-sensitive
3/4/2022,"The vast majority of vulnerable young women and girls in the criminal justice system have previously suffered abuse and violence and are in danger of being retraumatised by the experience, charities say. The Young Women’s Justice Project report, published on Friday, urges the Ministry of Justice to act to break the “cycle of abuse, inequality and offending”. The report, the culmination of two years’ work, brings together existing data and research and shows that up to 90% of girls in contact with the youth justice system have experienced abuse from a family member or someone they trusted, and 63% of girls and young women aged 16-24 serving community sentences have experienced rape or domestic abuse. Indy Cross, the chief executive of Agenda, which produced the report with the Alliance for Youth Justice, said: “It’s shocking that most girls and young women in the criminal justice system have experienced trauma, and yet their specific needs are ignored in favour of punishment and exclusion. It’s time that the criminal justice system stopped retraumatising vulnerable people and listened to what they are telling us. “We need girls and young women to be heard instead of harmed. Young women are being punished for their responses to trauma and the survival strategies they rely upon.” The report also says that: There is greater prevalence of poor mental health among young women in the criminal justice system compared with young men and older women. Girls in custody self-harm at much higher rates than boys. 74% of girls in youth custody have previously been permanently excluded from school compared with 63% of boys. Black, Asian and other minority women and those with experience of the care system are significantly overrepresented among young women who have come into contact with the criminal justice system. Sarah (not her real name), 22, who contributed to the report, said: “I’ve seen the worst in prison. I get flashbacks all the time. I see people trying to kill themselves, I see babies that have died in prison, pregnant women and stuff. And they don’t care, the system does not care.” Recommendations in the report include prioritising investment in young women at all stages of the criminal justice system, listening to what their needs are, and ensuring that people working with them recognise and respond to those needs – including needs specific to women from minorities and from care. Pippa Goodfellow, the chief executive of the Alliance for Youth Justice, said: “Girls and young women’s experiences of coming into contact with the criminal justice system are frequently characterised by multiple forms of disadvantage, including experiences of violence, abuse and exploitation. But throughout the system, from policing to prisons, rather than understanding these vulnerabilities and responding appropriately, they are often met with use of force, physical restraint and isolation.” A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Since we launched our female offender strategy in 2018 we have seen a 30% drop in the number of women entering the criminal justice system. “We are also investing tens of millions of pounds into community services like women’s centres, drug rehabilitation and accommodation support. These will help all women, including those who may have experienced trauma such as domestic abuse, get their lives back on track.”",News/Society,UK justice system risks causing fresh trauma to women and girls – study,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/04/uk-justice-system-risks-causing-fresh-trauma-to-women-and-girls-study

3/4/2022,"Vladimir Putin is using Russia’s hold over fossil fuel supplies to Europe as “a political and economic weapon” in the war in Ukraine, the world’s foremost energy adviser has said, presenting western governments with crucial questions over how they face down the threat to democracy while also heading off climate disaster. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, said: “Nobody is under any illusions any more. Russia’s use of its natural gas resources as an economic and political weapon shows Europe needs to act quickly to be ready to face considerable uncertainty over Russian gas supplies next winter.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted European governments, including the UK’s, to make a frantic reappraisal of their energy supplies – one that arguably should have come much sooner. The first outcome has been a fresh resolve in some countries – including from the UK business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng – to push for more renewable energy generation and energy efficiency to cut dependence on fossil fuels. Kwarteng’s intervention – “The long-term solution is obvious: gas is more expensive than renewable energy, so we need to move away from gas,” he tweeted – was unexpectedly firm, cheering green campaigners who had feared that rightwing voices in the Tory party who have sought to make scrapping the net zero target a “culture war” issue were in the ascendant. Doug Parr, the chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, said: “Kwasi Kwarteng has clocked it. Our dependence on gas is a problem, and warmer homes powered by renewables are the cheapest and quickest solution. Kwarteng must convince chancellor Rishi Sunak that we need a masterplan, and the money to get the UK off gas. We need to insulate our homes, roll out heat pumps and renewable power to rapidly address Putin’s grip on European gas markets, our sky-high energy bills, and the climate crisis unfolding before our eyes.” Germany has announced plans to ramp up energy efficiency and renewable energy, and is considering delaying the closure of its remaining nuclear power stations. France’s Emmanuel Macron called for a “renaissance” of low-carbon nuclear power to secure domestic energy supplies. In the US, Joe Biden used his state of the union speech to bang the drum again for his proposed clean energy stimulus programme. Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington, said: “The Russian invasion of Ukraine greatly increases the likelihood that the US Congress will pass huge new clean energy incentives this year because of an increased focus on energy security. Such a massive expansion of zero-emission US energy will also free up more US natural gas to flow to Europe to displace Russian gas, which has far higher fugitive emissions of methane. Together these actions would represent a significant improvement not only in global energy geopolitics, but result in major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions as well.” But as the war in Ukraine continues to rage, there is also a significant danger that – particularly if Putin goes further and cuts off gas supplies – governments could pivot the opposite way. As the IEA noted: “Other avenues are available to the EU if it wishes or needs to reduce reliance on Russian gas even more quickly … The major near-term option would involve switching away from gas consumption in the power sector via increased use of Europe’s coal-fired fleet, or by using alternative fuels such as oil within existing gas-fired power plants.” The decision may be taken by private-sector companies with coal-fired power stations that were recently closed or scheduled to close and could be brought back on stream quickly, said Richard Howard, the research director at Aurora Energy Research. “The high gas prices being seen in the market will in any case create an economic incentive for generators to shift from gas power stations towards coal,” he said. A further complication is that Europe also depends on Russia for coal. In the US, the opportunities to export gas from fracking, and coal for power stations, may also expand temptingly as fossil fuel prices rise, and to fill the gaps that open up as countries move away from Russian supplies. Then there is the question of how much consumers will stand. Petrol prices in the US, as in many places around the world, are now at the highest in a decade and still rising. Phillip Braun, a professor of finance at Northwestern University in the US, said: “American consumers need to accept that rising gas prices are a necessary cost to help the Ukrainian people in the midst of their profound crisis.” Whether consumers will continue to pay this price for democracy has not yet been tested. After years of grindingly slow progress in shifting away from coal and oil, if countries were to resume fossil fuel use under the impact of Russia’s war, it would spell disaster for attempts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. This week the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned of global devastation already under way and set to intensify if temperatures rise further, in what scientists termed “the bleakest warning yet”. Tim Crosland, the director of Plan B, a climate campaign group, said the IPCC report showed that reaching for more fossil fuels as a response to Putin would only put the world in greater peril. “There is no option of ramping up fossil fuel production as a counter to Putin,” he said. “A strategy for deescalation of the war in Ukraine can and must be integrated with a strategy for the urgent and radical reduction of carbon emissions, starting with an end to new fossil fuel supply projects, as required to limit warming to 1.5C. Separate the two logics [of climate and dealing with the war] and it’s all over.” These issues will come into sharp focus at the next UN climate meeting, Cop27, due to be held in Egypt in November. So far preparations have been unaffected, and diplomats privately note that climate negotiations have carried on through 30 years of political upheavals, including wars among UN members. But the key questions over energy policy will need to be resolved long before countries meet again on the climate. Given the time it takes to change energy systems, as the IEA made clear, governments must prepare now for what next winter will bring.",News/Environment,Ukraine war prompts European reappraisal of its energy supplies ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/04/ukraine-war-european-reappraisal-energy-supplies-coal-renewables
3/4/2022,"Children’s education is being eroded by financial pressures triggering staff cuts and scaled-back curriculums, with local authority-run secondary schools among the worst hit, according to parliament’s spending watchdog. The Department for Education (DfE) insists the school system in England is in good financial health overall, but a report by the public accounts committee (PAC) warned that national figures “mask significant variation and challenges for individual schools”. One in four secondary schools maintained by local authorities were in deficit in 2019/20, forcing them to cut staff, narrow the curriculum and reduce support for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities, it said. In contrast, the report highlights the relative wealth of some academy trusts that have built up large reserves with a cumulative surplus of £3.1bn – money which is therefore not being spent on current pupils’ education, the report points out. More than one in five academy trusts (22%) had reserve balances equivalent to more than 20% of their annual income in the year ending 31 August 2020. Academy trusts may decide to build up their reserves to pay for capital works, but the PAC has called on the education department to investigate whether the highest reserves are justified. The PAC report said 88% of schools maintained by local authorities and 93% of academy trusts in England were in surplus. Behind those figures however, the report points out that in 26 local authorities, more than 20% of maintained schools were in deficit. The DfE said later however that the most up-to-date figures showed 95.9% of academy trusts and 91.6% of maintained schools now have balanced accounts and the percentage of maintained schools in deficit had decreased from 12% in 2019-20 to 8% in 2020-21. “Investment in schools is rising – we have confirmed an overall £4.7bn increase to the core school budget by 2024-25 and will continue to deliver year on year, real terms per pupil increases, including a 5% real terms per pupil boost in 2022-23,” a spokesperson said. MPs on the PAC said the DfE had little assurance that the extra £4.7bn for school funding from the 2021 spending review would be enough to cover cost pressures, including the impact of the Covid pandemic. They also raised concerns about the government’s national funding formula, introduced in 2018-19 to make the funding of England’s schools more fair and transparent, which has resulted in rebalancing of funds away from deprived schools with a higher proportion of children eligible for free school meals. PAC chair Dame Meg Hillier said: “The DfE’s airy assurances about the healthy books of academies in particular mask some cruel divides between the haves and have-nots. Rather than … blithely looking for laurels to rest on, [the DfE] must grasp that it’s not OK for any group of our children to be abandoned in the system that it oversees.” Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “This report highlights problems in the education system that are longstanding and have seriously hindered the ability of schools to give every child the education they deserve.” Meanwhile, colleges in England are facing their worst staffing crisis for two decades, with 6,000 job vacancies, according to a report by the Association of Colleges. There are on average 30 vacancies in each institution, while one college reported 162 vacancies. Kirsti Lord, the association’s deputy chief executive, said: “The issue for colleges around recruiting and retaining staff has been building for some time. It is a symptom of the decision to freeze or reduce colleges’ funding for over a decade and has left the sector struggling to keep pace on pay.”",News/Education,Schools suffering budget-driven cuts in staffing and curriculum ,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/04/schools-suffering-budget-driven-cuts-in-staffing-and-curriculum
3/4/2022,"Five of the world’s biggest agribusiness firms sought to weaken a draft EU law banning food imports linked to deforestation, eight days after pledging to accelerate their forest protection efforts at Cop26, documents seen by the Guardian show. Forest protection hopes had been raised when the CEOs of 10 food companies with a combined revenue of nearly $500bn (£373bn) vowed to “accelerate sector-wide action” towards eliminating commodity-driven deforestation as the climate summit began on 2 November. Agriculture is responsible for a quarter of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, and the companies promised a supply chain reform plan to peg global heating to 1.5C by November 2022. But on 10 November, trade associations representing five of the firms – ADM, Bunge, Cargill, LDC and Viterra – warned the EU’s green deal chief, Frans Timmermans, of soaring prices and food shortages if the EU proceeded with its own blueprint. The European Commission’s plan, which is now being considered by EU ministers, would force firms to segregate commodities such as coffee, soy, beef or cocoa thought to be linked to deforestation, and prevent them from entering the EU market. However, this is “technically and effectively not feasible”, according to the industry letter obtained by Greenpeace Unearthed and shared with the Guardian. The EU proposal could cause “major price increases and problems of availability”, the letter says, while “reducing the offer for affordable food, increasing costs for farmers and EU-based industries, and amplifying risks of supply shortages for high-protein material”. Instead, the three trade associations – Coceral, Fediol and Fefac – called for a mass balance system to monitor and certify “sustainable volumes” of commodities along supply chains. Sini Eräjää, Greenpeace EU’s food and nature campaigner, said that the demands would have rendered the deforestation law “meaningless”. “For example, mass balance systems allow the mixing of goods that meet legal sustainability criteria with those that do not,” she said. “They would drive a coach and horses through the middle of the EU’s due diligence proposal through which vast quantities of unsustainable and illegal goods could follow.” The Green MEP Anna Cavazzini told the Guardian: “It is very disappointing that some of the same companies who made pledges at Cop26 to act against deforestation are [asking] the European Commission to water down the legislative ambitions in this area. Real change can only happen if companies practice in private what they preach in public.” The letter’s signatories insist they remain committed to curbing deforestation. A Viterra spokesperson said the letter was intended “to create awareness of possible challenges that could negatively affect imports into Europe”. Bunge, whose executive Jordi Costa currently holds the Fediol presidency, said that the missive was “part of an open consultation process that aims to support the design of an effective framework to achieve sustainable transformation”. ADM, which holds the Fediol vice-presidency, said the problem was that the current EU proposal would “create a two-tier market, one for Europe and one for the rest of the world”. Cargill, which is also represented on Fediol’s board, was working with industry associations to find the most effective way of eliminating deforestation in an “economically viable” way for farmers, said a spokesperson. A second letter co-authored by industry groups including the three trade associations on 3 February, argued that poor smallholder farmers would be “negatively affected” by the new law. The use of “geo-localisation data” to trace commodity origins would be a particular problem for small farmers, said the missive to the French ecological transition minister, Barbara Pompili, which the Guardian has seen. Groups representing more than 34,000 Ivorian cocoa farmers rejected that claim in a letter to EU ministers and MEPs dated 1 March. Digital traceability offers a “unique opportunity” to address social equity issues like respect for official cocoa prices, the non-payment of promised sustainability premiums and cracking down on supply chain intermediaries and illegal cooperatives in protected forests, they argued. “The industry players who are trying to prevent a traceability system involving the geolocalistion of plots and the identification of each producer, are in reality campaigning for nothing to change,” said the letter, seen by the Guardian. Bakary Traoré, the director of Idef, an NGO in Côte d’Ivoire, added that the industry lobbying had been more about “safeguarding the major companies’ stranglehold on the sector, than improving the lives of smallholders”.",News/Environment,Agribusiness giants tried to thwart EU deforestation plan after Cop26 pledge,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/04/agribusiness-giants-tried-to-thwart-eu-deforestation-plan-after-cop26-pledge
3/4/2022,"What does it mean to live in a democracy? Well, according to the Fox News host Tucker Carlson, it means having the right to harangue Black women and force them to show their papers. On Wednesday Carlson went on a tirade about the District of Columbia circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who Joe Biden has nominated to replace supreme courtJustice Stephen Breyer. Jackson’s confirmation, if it happens, would fulfil Biden’s campaign promise to nominate a Black female justice. “So is Ketanji Brown Jackson – a name that even Joe Biden has trouble pronouncing – one of the top legal minds in the entire country?” Carlson asked. “[I]t might be time for Joe Biden to let us know what Ketanji Brown Jackson’s LSAT score was. How did she do on the LSATs? … It would seem like Americans in a democracy have a right to know.” Before we get on to Jackson’s qualifications, perhaps we ought to have a word about Tucker Swanson McNear Carlson’s own credentials. If he thinks Ketanji Brown Jackson’s name is difficult to pronounce, perhaps he shouldn’t be a television presenter. Of course, Carlson has no problem saying Jackson’s name. He’s just being racist: which seems to be the only qualification one needs to get a gig on Fox News. The LSATs are a multiple-choice exam that you have to take to get into most law schools in the US. Carlson must have only realized that it was written in the constitution that all Americans have a right to view a judge’s LSAT exams recently because there’s no record of him asking for the LSAT scores of recent supreme court nominees, such as Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh, to be released. I wonder why he’s so worked up about them this time? While Jackson’s LSATs may not be public knowledge (her kindergarten report cards have also not been released to the American people), her qualifications are impeccable. She went to Harvard Law School; served as a supervising editor for the Harvard Law Review; clerked for three judges including Justice Breyer; spent 15 years as a public defender; eight years as a trial court judge in the US district court in DC; was vice-chair of the US Sentencing Commission; and has issued a number of notable rulings. But none of that’s good enough for Carlson. He will not rest until we see her LSATs, a flawed measure of student potential that helps candidates get into law school, but has zero to say about their ability after they graduate. Even if it turned out Jackson’s score was stellar, no doubt Tucker would want to her see her birth certificate as well. And maybe pull out the calipers and take some head measurements while he’s at it. It doesn’t matter how hard you work or how many accomplishments you rack up, if you’re a minority there is always someone like Carlson ready to tell you that the only reason you’ve got to where you are is because of things like affirmative action or political correctness. I’ve certainly had my own Carlson moment. My first job out of university was a trainee solicitor at a corporate law firm. A white guy at my law school had a minor meltdown when he found out I’d got into the same firm he had been rejected by. “Probably a diversity hire!” he told me in a “jokey” tone of voice. It is true, of course, that a significant number of unqualified people get into prestigious universities and top jobs thanks to affirmative action. But you know who benefits from affirmative action the most? Rich white people. Take Harvard, for example. A 2019 analysis of the Ivy League’s school admissions data found that only around 57% of white students were admitted to Harvard on merit. A whopping 43% of them were there because they were “ALDCs”: athletes, legacy students (their parents went to the school), on the dean’s list (their parents donated to the school) or the children of Harvard employees. By contrast, less than 16% of African American, Hispanic and Asian American admits were ALDCs. Once you’re out of university there’s still plenty of affirmative action for well-connected white people. One analysis found that an American male is 8,500 times more likely to become a senator if their dad is a senator. The same study found American men are 1,895 times more likely to become a famous chief executive, 1,639 times more likely to win a Pulitzer, and 1,361 times more likely to win an Academy award if daddy did the same thing first. If Carlson really is so keen on ensuring that the US is a meritocracy, then I suggest he worry less about making Jackson’s LSAT scores public and focus on rather different data instead. How exactly did Jared Kushner get into Harvard, for example? Did it have anything to do with the $2.5m his dad pledged to the school? How did Donald Trump get into the prestigious University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance? Is it true his dad pulled a few strings?

3/4/2022,"Nasa has completed three of the seven stages to bring the 18 hexagonal segments of the James Webb space telescope’s primary mirror into alignment. On 25 February, Nasa announced that the mirror segments were in place and their individual images stacking together. This means the separate images produced by the segments have been united to form a single image. It marks the beginning of the segments working as a single mirror. Each segment is controlled by six motors that can move and tilt the reflective surfaces. After the primary mirror’s deployment on 19 January, ground crews began commanding the motors to coax the segments into line. By 12 February, all 18 were directing unfocused starlight into the near infrared camera. Next, the segments were moved so each image was focused, and now the segments have been tilted so the individual images fall on top of one another. Fine-tuning will ensure the segments are optimally aligned with themselves and the four science instruments. This is likely to take until late spring. The first true images from the telescope are expected in early summer.",News/Science,Spacewatch: Nasa’s Webb telescope mirror alignment continues,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/04/spacewatch-nasa-webb-telescope-mirror-alignment-continues
3/4/2022,"Greater Manchester police (GMP) have paid out £8,000 to a woman who reported being drugged and raped, only to be pressed into dropping the case without a proper investigation “because nothing will come of it”. The 31-year-old woman, who is married with three children, reported the rape on 14 July 2019, a few hours after waking up disoriented at the alleged perpetrator’s house in Wigan, Greater Manchester. She said she was almost naked and had no memory of much of the previous evening, but suspected she had been raped after experiencing “excruciating” pain going to the toilet. “It was worse than after childbirth, and I have had a forceps delivery, and been cut up,” she told the Guardian. She said she had grab marks up and down her arms. She said two officers went round to see her that morning but were dismissive of her situation, suggesting she and her husband go to the man she feared had raped her to “set the record straight”. Officers left after about 20 minutes without arranging for any physical tests to be carried out, and having got her to sign a statement saying she would take no further action. Details of the payout emerged the day after a report from the police inspectorate found that GMP “doesn’t investigate crimes effectively, so some offenders escape justice and victims don’t get the service they deserve”. The woman’s solicitors, Hudgell, said it was at least the third such payout they had won from GMP in the past 21 months. In June 2020, the force paid a five-figure sum to a woman who was mocked in emails between officers after she alleged she was raped. Last month the force paid compensation to a homeless woman after she alleged officers had failed to properly investigate an assault on her in her tent. In the latest case, a female officer is alleged to have taken the woman into a room on her own and encouraged her to drop the case. “She advised me that reporting a rape meant ‘it would be over mine and my family’s heads for quite a while’, that it ‘would take a year to resolve’, and that if it went to court ‘nothing would come of it’. Then we went back in the other room and in front of everyone she said to my husband ‘I recommend you go to him [the alleged attacker] and see if you can set the record straight’,” the woman said. An investigation was eventually carried out after the woman phoned the police again later that day. Specialist officers arrived just before midnight and took her to hospital, where she was examined. GMP agreed to pay £8,000 in damages but have made no admission of liability. The woman’s claim was made on the basis that officers violated her human rights by failing to conduct a sufficient investigation. She argued they should have known that delays in investigating claims would reduce the chances of proceeding to a prosecution. Her lawyer, Nicola Bailey Gibbs, from Hudgells, said: “My client was treated in a wholly inappropriate manner, and it was a shocking error of judgment by trained police officers who completely failed in their duty of care for somebody who was in a distressed state and informing them that she believed she may have been drugged and raped. “The officer believed the best way forward would be to attend the male’s property and have a mutual chat. In what scenario would it ever be acceptable to say to a potential victim, who is reporting a suspected rape, that they should go back to the property where the alleged attack had happened and discuss it with the individual they are reporting?” GMP said a 43-year-old man had been arrested in connection with the case and that the force’s Professional Standards Branch was conducting an investigation, which was on hold until the criminal investigation had concluded. A GMP spokesperson said: ‘“We always strive to place victim care at the heart of everything we do and we expect our officers and staff to uphold the highest standards, and whenever we fall short of expectations it is important it is reported so we can take appropriate action wherever necessary. “We will endeavour to keep the victim in this case informed of our progress in both these matters.”",News/UK news,"Manchester police pay £8,000 to woman urged to drop rape claim",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/04/manchester-police-pay-8000-to-woman-urged-to-drop-claim
3/4/2022,"My children can’t remember a time when they didn’t go to school in masks. The first lockdown, in March 2020, happened halfway through kindergarten, and as far as they’re concerned they’ve never seen their teachers’ faces unmasked, or enjoyed an unmuffled exchange with them. They are masked in the playground and the gym and at their after-school programme, for up to nine hours at a stretch. They are so accustomed to masks at this point that they ask to wear them when it isn’t required. All of this is about to change, when New York, which still has some of the strictest Covid regulations in the US, prepares to relax its school mask mandate next week. Barring an “unforeseen spike”, Eric Adams, the city’s mayor, announced that, on Monday 7 March, he was willing to allow New York’s one million public schoolchildren to return to unmasked learning. Elsewhere, mask use is visibly waning, even among the vulnerable elderly. It was noted on Tuesday night that, prior to President Biden’s State of the Union address, the 79-year-old moved through the chamber unmasked, dispensing hugs. The US is, in this regard, a stage or so behind England, which has abandoned all Covid precautions either as a sensible gesture towards moving on, a piece of political cynicism or a sign of giving up. It’s an odd effect of Ukraine displacing Covid in the news that, overnight, wearing a mask seems simultaneously a more trivial inconvenience (“try sleeping in a bomb shelter”) and, for a lot of people, I suspect, a less pressing need. In New York, the daily average of people testing positive for Covid has dwindled to 1.9%, well down on the 3.41% average for the past month, but that’s not the whole story. My own lassitude – I still wear a mask in public indoor settings, but mainly out of politeness, habit and conformity – is less linked to the numbers than to an abrupt and acute sense of history moving on. One strand of this is the experience of seeing a lot of people catch Omicron and sail through it without symptoms. Another, not articulated perhaps but still setting off internal sirens, is the restlessness caused by an imminent season change. It’s about to be spring, a new dawn; vaccines are available for everyone over five; we did the right thing for two years; this is enough now. There are obvious flaws to this logic. It’s myopic. It’s insensitive towards those for whom Covid still represents a significant risk. It’s also irrational. To give up worrying about Covid because Russia invaded Ukraine doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. The truth is that any significant shift back to normalcy requires a level of arbitrary line-drawing. Given that Covid can’t be eradicated, a measure of community infection will always be present, requiring a balance of risk and reward. I’m convinced that the quieter of my two kids has never uttered a sentence her teacher has been able to hear. Where, on the scale between death and “no big deal”, does this rank? I keep reading pieces about how the old world has gone, how there’s no “going back” to the way things were, but that seems to me a truism of time passing. And, just as anti-mask campaigners are powered by factors not based in science, plenty of people are invested, for obscure psychological reasons, in catastrophising the data. There will come a point, relatively soon, when, if you want to ride the elevator alone, you’ll be expected to bear the inconvenience and step out to wait for the next one rather than expecting others not to step in. The kids will do as they’re instructed and, as they adjusted to masks overnight, they’ll almost certainly snap back just as seamlessly. Which isn’t to say we’ll throw all ours out next Monday. It will come down to numbers, and not Covid ones. For the first few days after the mandate lifts, my assumption is that everyone will send their kids to school in masks. Slowly, and without a decision expressly being made, the kids will start shedding their masks in the playground. Through lack of enforcement, those masks will quickly be lost. Until a new variant changes the parameters again, the guiding principle will be less one of herd immunity than herd behaviour. When I asked my two what they wanted to do on Monday, they said: “Let’s wait and see what everyone else does.” Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,Unmasking school pupils in New York already feels like yesterday’s news | Emma Brockes,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/04/unmasking-school-pupils-new-york-ukraine-covid-history
3/4/2022,"The New South Wales transport secretary sought two “urgent” meetings with David Elliott in the week before the shutdown of the Sydney rail system to warn him about the possible closure of the network, but the requests were ignored, a parliamentary hearing has been told. Rob Sharp, the head of the state’s transport network, told a budget estimates hearing on Friday that after the Rail, Tram and Bus Union first notified the department of its planned protected action on 9 February, he sent an email to Elliott’s chief of staff two days later seeking an “urgent” meeting. But Sharp said he never received a response to the email. He told the hearing that on 14 February he sent another email in which he “chased up” the request, but again no response was received. “In the week leading up to the shutdown you asked the minister’s office twice to meet with the minister, and the minister’s office never got back to you?” Labor’s shadow treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, asked Sharp on Friday. “Correct,” he responded. In the week before the shutdown of the rail network, the NSW government launched a case in the Fair Work Commission seeking to block the RTBU’s industrial action. In the days before it lodged the dispute on Friday 18 February, the department prepared a series of documents including affidavits stating the network would need to close if the RTBU’s planned industrial action went ahead. Sharp told the hearing on Friday that he would have told Elliott about the possibility of a shutdown if his request for a meeting had been granted. “Was it your intent at the urgent meeting you had requested to disclose to the minister that one of the possibilities was that the network would have to close?” Mookhey asked. “Yes,” Sharp responded. Sharp was eventually granted a meeting with Elliott on 17 February. Despite requesting an hour-long meeting, he was only given half an hour during which, he said, the prospect of the shutdown was not raised because he had to prioritise lodging the Fair Work dispute. “It wasn’t a detailed meeting [and] we were at a point where we need to submit to Fair Work,” he said. “The timeframe didn’t allow for detailed discussions of risk assessments.” Sharp said if he had been granted a longer meeting, it “would have been a more fulsome conversation around the nuances of the risk assessments and implications” of the protected action. While Sharp has produced a dossier of documents which he claims shows staff in the minister’s office were fully briefed about the shutdown, the minister has insisted his chief of staff was only told about “significant” or “massive” disruption on the Sunday before the closure. On Friday Elliott told the hearing that he “disputes” the version of events provided by Sharp. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But the hearing also learned that at 10.51pm on the night before the shutdown, Elliott was forwarded a text message from a senior transport official warning that there was likely to be “massive disruption” on the Monday morning. Elliott said he did not make further inquiries about the “massive disruption” because industrial action had been common during his time as minister. He had instead chosen “to get up at four in the morning to find out what the massive disruption would look like”, he said. The strained relationship between Elliott and his transport chief has been well-known in Macquarie Street for some time, and Sharp revealed he had made at least one other request for an urgent meeting with the minister in late January after an item appeared in the Daily Telegraph criticising him. The article cited sources saying Elliott had been complaining to colleagues that Sharp had yet to arrange a meeting with him, and stating the secretary “has not so much as even sent a text to the new minister”. But Sharp told the hearing that despite requesting it, he had not been given Elliott’s phone number by that point, and had been told to direct all communication through the minister’s chief of staff. Afterwards Sharp requested a meeting to discuss the article, saying the criticism had “surprised” him because he had not received any negative feedback. “I requested a meeting to discuss it as one would and no meeting was forthcoming,” he said. Sharp told the committee that he subsequently obtained Elliott’s phone number and sent him a text message on 24 January. “I didn’t get a response,” he said.",News/Australia news,Top NSW rail bureaucrat sought urgent meetings with David Elliot before shutdown but was ignored,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/04/top-nsw-rail-bureaucrat-sought-urgent-meetings-with-david-elliot-before-shutdown-but-was-ignored
3/4/2022,"The sun is breaking through the early morning mist and the ground is frozen solid. It’s the sort of morning that sheep farmers dream of, cold and frosty to “kill off bugs”, with sunshine on the sheep’s backs. I stand by the side of the road squinting into the sun, waiting for the funeral cortege. At this time of year, the mountains all around are so steep that we only see sunlight in the very middle of the day. When we bought our farm, the previous farmer had to leave through ill health, and while he was happy that it had been bought by a family who wanted to farm, he had already had to move out and did not want to meet us. He wanted to remember the farm as it was, having lived and worked there for 50 years. This morning is the morning of his funeral, and he is being driven through the farm one last time. The cars crawl down the hill and stop at the entrance to the farm lane. For a minute the cars stay there, giving him a final chance to say goodbye. “I’m looking after it for you,” I whisper, and the cars drive on. I feel suddenly very moved by the passing of the farm from one generation to the next, just as I did four years ago when his brother handed me keys, a shepherd’s guide and some horn-branding irons. I am strangely affected by saying goodbye to someone I have never met but whose legacy is all around me every day. Ownership of land is just a fleeting thing. As a farmer, I don’t feel that the farm belongs to me, I belong to it and am part of it. Later in the day, as I walk to the post office, there is activity in the church graveyard as the family grave is closed again. The farmer has become part of the land itself. I wonder if he was buried with sheep’s wool between his thumb and first finger, as is the local tradition, so that when he arrives in the next world, he has the excuse that his flock kept him tied to the land and out of church on Sundays.
