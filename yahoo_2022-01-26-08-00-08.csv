1/26/2022,"Chris Evans' trainer said the actor had an imbalanced body when he was cast to play Captain America. The trainer said Evans was previously focused on working out only his biceps, chest, and core.  Evans' body transformation included learning different principles of athleticism and fitness. Chris Evans' character Steve Rogers went through a dramatic body transformation from a skinny kid to a swole supersoldier in the 2011 film ""Captain America: The First Avenger."" But behind the scenes, Evans went through a similar yet less dramatic transformation, according to his trainer Simon Waterson.  Waterson, the author of the newly released ""Intelligent Fitness: The Smart Way to Reboot Your Body and Get in Shape,"" told Insider that when he started training Evans for the first ""Captain America"" movie in 2010, the then-28-year-old actor had the body of a college guy — disproportionately muscular in his biceps, chest, and core. ""He was quite athletic, but as he said to me, he typically did 'the college workout,' so he was a bit imbalanced,"" Waterson told Insider. ""He just trained his biceps, and his chest, and his abs, and that was it."" To bring the characters of Marvel to life on the big screen, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has led the way in special and visual effects. Movies like ""Captain America: Civil War"" involved demanding stunts from cast members like Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson and their stunt doubles. ""Captain Marvel"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" featured innovative de-aging work that allowed them to show actors Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell at different points in time. Meanwhile, the motion-capture breakthroughs in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" helped turn Josh Brolin's Thanos into a terrifying and memorable villain. He added: ""He could do a lot of pushing exercises but not a lot of pulling exercises. So he didn't deadlift, he didn't do many pull-ups, he didn't have very overdeveloped legs.""  Waterson said he helped Evans master a workout routine that built strength in the muscles that weren't getting enough work, which allowed the actor foster a more balanced physique and improve his mobility for action scenes. Waterson said the training routine he devised in 2010 was the same one the actor followed throughout his nine-year run as the character, which ended after the release of ""Avengers: Endgame"" in 2019. Waterson has another name for Evans' approach to fitness before they met. ""What he called a college workout in the US is what we call a pub workout in the UK,"" Waterson told Insider. ""It's just about training your pub muscles, and your pub muscles are the ones that are on show for everyone else and not there for yourself."" Waterson said that kind of training not only caused an imbalance in the appearance of your body but also put strain on your spine — especially if you focused too much on your chest without reinforcing your back muscles to balance it out, Waterson said. At an extreme, that is the kind of imbalance that can cause curvature in the spine, such as kyphosis. It can also increase the risk of injury. Waterson's mission with Evans was to instill a transformative workout routine that focused on athleticism just as much as aesthetics. The point of the changes was to ensure Evans could perform most of his own stunts as Captain America, Waterson said. ""It was a mixture of heavy lifting but then also dynamic circuits,"" Waterson said. ""I would make it so he had really great movements because, obviously, Captain America has really good movements. We were working both angles, the aesthetic and the athletic to give him the ultimate performance."" Waterson's dynamic circuits were based on body-weight workouts. They included: Sprints. Mountain climbers. Lunges. Total resistance exercises. Sit-ups. One area that Evans struggled with early on was with lower-body workouts since he focused on his upper body and core before 2010, Waterson said. But he eventually mastered them with experience. Waterson added that the two leg workouts that helped anchor Evans' lower-body development were squats and deadlifts.

1/26/2022,"Korean American snowboarder Chloe Kim recently revealed what life was like after the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, mentioning that she ""hated life"" and was never left alone following her success.

Speaking to Time, Kim, 21, admitted she had trouble coping with her newfound fame after becoming the youngest female athlete to win a gold medal in the halfpipe at the 2018 Winter Games.

Kim, who was 17 at the time, noted that she could no longer go to her “favorite place,” and all she wanted was “a day where I was left alone.”

“I appreciate that everyone loves and supports me, but I just wish people could understand what I was going through up to that point,” Kim continued. “Everyone was like, ‘I just met her, and she’s such a b*tch.’ I’m not a b*tch. I just had the most exhausting two months of my life, and the minute I get home I’m getting hassled.”

At one point, feeling “so burnt out” and “in a pretty low, dark place,” Kim tossed her gold medal in the trash at her parents’ home in Southern California before retrieving it later.

“I hated life,” she told Time.

Her success in the sport also made her a target of others’ negative reactions. Kim said that she received “hateful messages” after winning silver at the 2014 X Games and that the experience made her cry herself to sleep on “the best night” of her life.

“At that point, you’re like, ‘OK, who can I turn to? Who has probably dealt with this before?’ I would constantly look for anyone. But there was no one,” she said, adding that some unidentified teammates had bullied her on social media.

She was also targeted with anti-Asian hate amid the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2021, NextShark previously reported. Kim noted that she receives ""hundreds"" of racist messages every month. She first started receiving hateful comments after she began competing at the age of 13.

Kim took a break from snowboarding to attend Princeton University in 2019, but her fame followed her. “I was like, ‘I don’t want to be here as the snowboarder. I want to be here as a student. I want to be like everyone else. I want to be normal. That’s why I came here.’”

Kim is one of the Asian American athletes who will compete for Team USA in the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. She will be joined by Nathan Chen, Vincent Zhou and Jason Brown, who will compete in figure skating.

1/26/2022,"By Jan Wolfe and Helen Coster WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dominion Voting Systems Corp has told a court there is ""no realistic possibility"" that the voting machine manufacturer will reach settlements in its billion-dollar defamation lawsuits against Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, lawyers who worked for former President Donald Trump. Dominion and another voting software firm, Smartmatic, have brought several lawsuits against people who spread conspiracy theories related to their voting machines after the 2020 presidential election that Trump lost to President Joe Biden. ""Given the devastating harm to Plaintiffs, the lack of remorse shown by Defendants, and the fact that many of them continue to double down on their lies, Plaintiffs do not believe any realistic possibility of settlement exists,"" Denver-based Dominion said in a filing https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.225699/gov.uscourts.dcd.225699.63.0.pdf on Monday in federal court in Washington. Lawyers for Giuliani and Powell said in the same filing that their clients may be open to settlement talks once the exchange of evidence, or ""discovery,"" is complete. ""Powell and Giuliani have nothing to show remorse for and dispute that they have lied about anything,"" the defense lawyers said. ""There's no particular incentive to settle with Giuliani or Powell, and it's not just the sadistic glee of making their lives miserable by forcing this to continue,"" said Don Herzog, a University of Michigan law professor. ""It's that almost always, the party settling will stipulate in its terms of settlement: I don't concede that I did anything wrong. And unless they're nuts, what the corporation wants out of those two is exactly the acknowledgment that you did something wrong. So for them, there's a pressing interest to go to trial and make them lose,"" Herzog added. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, was the lead campaign lawyer for Trump, who continues to falsely claim the 2020 election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud. Trump's campaign distanced itself from Powell in November 2020 after she appeared with Giuliani at a news conference and claimed without evidence that electronic voting systems had switched millions of ballots to Biden. Powell the following month visited Trump at the White House and urged him to seize voting machines and to appoint her as a special counsel to investigate the election, according to the news website Axios. Dominion has other pro-Trump media personalities and networks, including MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and Newsmax, seeking billions of dollars in monetary damages. The defendants have argued in court filings that they engaged in free speech protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.

1/26/2022,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — A prosecutor in Mexico said Tuesday the killing of two Canadians at a Caribbean coast resort last week was motivated by debts between international gangs apparently dedicated to drug and weapons trafficking. On Friday, prosecutors said both dead men had criminal records in Canada, and one was a known felon with a long record related to robbery, drug and weapons offenses. A third Canadian, a woman, was wounded and is being treated at a local hospital, but is not yet able to speak with investigators. “The investigations indicate that this attack was motivated by debts that arose from transnational illegal activities that the victims participated in,” said Oscar Montes, the chief prosecutor of the Quintana Roo state. “The information (is) that they were involved in weapons and drug trafficking, among other crimes.” Montes said the attack had been planned for almost a month by a cartel or gang that had not previously been known to operate in the area. But in keeping with standard procedure, he declined to name the gang. The attack took place Friday at the Hotel Xcaret resort is south of Playa del Carmen. The attackers apparently had guest wrist bands to enter the resort. Montes said a first group of assassins hired to kill the Canadians earlier in January abandoned the job because there was too much security. A second assassin flew in to the resort and carry out the killing, he said. Authorities said the two suspects arrested in the case so far include a professional kidnapper from Mexico City who coordinated the plot. Police also arrested a female, identified only by her last name, Nu, who was apparently part of the group of 10 Canadians who were vacationing at the resort. Montes said Nu both “cared for the children” of the victims and allegedly met with the killers and may have been providing them information on their activities. The hired killer who actually fired the shots is being sought. If Canadian gangs were involved in Quintana Roo, it would not be shocking. The Caribbean coast state, because of its huge flow of foreigners, has seen a number of crime rings with international connections. A Romanian gang has long operated in the state, using ATM machines to clone credit cards or make illegal withdrawals. And this week authorities arrested two Ukrainians for their alleged involvement in a fuel theft ring. Immigrant traffickers have long used Cancun as base for smuggling Cuban migrants Last week's killings were the latest in a series of brazen acts of violence along Mexico’s resort-studded Mayan Riviera coast, the crown jewel of the country's tourism industry. In November, a shootout on the beach of Puerto Morelos left two suspected drug dealers dead. Authorities said there were some 15 gunmen from a gang that apparently disputed control of drug sales there. In late October, farther south in the laidback destination of Tulum, two tourists — one a California travel blogger born in India and the other German — were caught in the apparent crossfire of rival drug dealers and killed. Following those events, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador sent nearly 1,500 members of the National Guard to reinforce security in the area.",World/Associated Press,Prosecutor: Killings of Canadians in Mexico due to gang debt,https://news.yahoo.com/prosecutor-killings-canadians-mexico-due-194320284.html
