3/19/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -Russia warned the United States on Thursday that Moscow had the might to put the world's pre-eminent superpower in its place and accused the West of stoking a wild Russophobic plot to tear Russia apart. Dmitry Medvedev, who served as president from 2008 to 2012 and is now deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, said the United States had stoked ""disgusting"" Russophobia in an attempt to force Russia to its knees. ""It will not work - Russia has the might to put all of our brash enemies in their place,"" Medvedev said. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the United States and its European and Asian allies have slapped sanctions on Russian leaders, companies and businessmen, cutting off Russia from much of the world economy. President Vladimir Putin says that what he calls the special military operation in Ukraine was necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Russia had to defend against the ""genocide"" of Russian-speaking people by Ukraine. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. The West says claims it wants to rip Russia apart are fiction. Russia says that despite sanctions it can fare well without what it casts as a deceitful and decadent West led by the United States. It says its bid to forge ties with the West after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union is now over and that it will develop ties with other powers such as China.

3/19/2022,"Chris Cuomo is burning down the house. Perhaps we should stand back simply to admire the flames. On Wednesday, Cuomo asked for an arbitrator to award him $125 million because CNN fired him for what even a first-year journalism student would have understood to be egregious ethical violations. Cuomo's Trumpian-style lack of ethics is old news. But his rationale for demanding enough money to make a tech exec envious is truly novel: I wasn't the only dishonest journalist on CNN's payroll. Exhibit No. 1 for the plaintiff is Don Lemon, the CNN host whom Cuomo used to refer to as his ""brother."" (Which is rich given how quick Cuomo was to nuke journalistic ethics to bail out his brother Andrew, the former New York governor.) In November, actor Jussie Smollett testified under oath that Lemon had tipped him off that police in Chicago didn't buy his claim that a pair of MAGA-hat wearing thugs had emerged from a snowstorm to beat him up and wrap a rope around his neck. Now, in Lemon's defense, hardly anyone outside the corridors of CNN believed Smollett's saga when the fable was first told. It shouldn't have been shocking to learn that Chicago cops, who hear more credible yarns from truant eighth-graders, had their doubts. But I digress. Don Lemon's decision as a self-confessed journalist to alert Smollett that the cops were on to him was an ethical breach almost as bad as helping a politician – who just happens to be your brother – cobble together a defense against sexual harassment allegations. More from Tim Swarens: She's a hero who challenged Putin on live TV. Now she's in a Russian jail cell. “Intervening in the ongoing investigation by texting Smollett was an inexcusable breach of ethics,” Cuomo's lawyers wrote in the arbitration filing. “Yet CNN did nothing; Lemon was not disciplined in any way.” Inexcusable breach of ethics. Employer looks the other way. Cuomo knows all about such things. For Exhibit No. 2, there is Jeffrey Toobin, the news network's chief legal analyst, who was suspended by CNN in October 2020 and fired by The New Yorker after he was caught – ah, enjoying himself – during a video call with colleagues at the magazine. CNN welcomed Toobin back into the family last June despite what Cuomo's lawyers describe as a ""sordid act of sexual harassment."" Ethical violations. Sexual harassment. Chris Cuomo. Somehow these words just keep colliding. Permanent daylight saving time?: Big government better keep its hands off my watch! For Exhibit 3, Team Cuomo calls to the stand former CNN President Jeff Zucker, who resigned in February after his personal relationship with chief marketing officer Allison Gollust was disclosed. Gollust also resigned. ""As long as CNN's ratings would not be hurt, Zucker and Gollust were more than willing to overlook major transgressions by CNN personalities such as Don Lemon and Jake Tapper, or even to engage in blatant misconduct themselves,"" Cuomo's lawyers declared. Finally, Cuomo gets to the crux of it. It was, is and always will be about ratings. What's the value of an old-fashioned ethical standard or two weighed in the balance of a journalistic celebrity who can attract enough eyeballs to pay rock-star level salaries? Ukraine war diary: I grew up in Russia. Now I fight in Kyiv for Ukraine Let's be honest: On one level, CNN is the best reality TV series going. Who needs ""Desperate Housewives of Missoula"" when the Cuomo vs. Lemon vs. Zucker cage match is ready for a rumble? Yet, on another level – one I like to call the real world – the timing of Cuomo's high dive into the mud bog is sad. After all, there is a war on. I mean a real war, not the one inside CNN's C-suite. CNN's journalists have shown a masterful level of skill and professionalism – and in many cases, remarkable courage – in covering that war in Ukraine. This should be their time to both report the news without internal distractions and to receive well-deserved appreciation from their audiences and their journalistic peers. Ukraine war diary: As Russia advances, Illarion Pavliuk makes a stop en route to Kyiv Chris Cuomo has shown why it matters to call out and to evenhandedly discipline bad journalism, including ethical violations. His former CNN colleagues – along with journalists from dozens of other news outlets –have shown every day for the past three weeks why good journalism is so vitally important. Cuomo may eventually get his money. But I'll put my money on those other journalists, the ones who understand that serving their audiences' needs are far more important than serving themselves.

3/19/2022,"A Japanese company specializing in cardboard boxes, Aasu Danboru (“Earth Cardboard”), has designed a cardboard bed that is available to purchase online for $50.

Cardboard beds have been used for some time in Japan at evacuation centers during disaster reliefs due to the ease of mass production, transport and disposal. Earth Cardboard, however, has made the bed available to everyone through online retailer Rakuten.

In accordance with Japan’s Disaster Relief Law, the bed was designed with cardboard moving-box material and is 72 by 29 by 12 inches. The bed also passed a one-week durability test without any issues by an approximately 5-foot-9 man weighing 176 pounds.

One reason contributing to the cardboard bed’s affordable price is that the company reuses moving boxes to build the base of the bed. When the bed is pulled apart, the base can be reused as moving boxes to easily transport materials at evacuation centers.

In a press release, the company claimed that their product is “the industry’s cheapest cardboard bed.”

Cardboard beds have previously been a topic of interest when they were assigned to athletes at the 2020 Summer Tokyo Olympics and were erroneously reported as “anti-sex” beds. The beds were later repurposed for COVID-19 patients at a temporary medical facility in Osaka.

The beds are currently available from Japanese online retailer Rakuten for 5,490 yen ($50) with free shipping.

3/19/2022,"LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) — Officials at Walt Disney World said Friday that a performance by a visiting Texas high school drill team that used American Indian stereotypes, including chants of “scalp them,"" doesn't reflect the Florida resort's values. The performance this week in the Magic Kingdom by the “Indianettes"" drill team from Port Neches-Grove High School “did not reflect our core values, and we regret it took place,"" Disney spokeswoman Jacquee Wahler said in an emailed statement. An audition tape that the school had provided in order to be selected to perform at the theme park resort was inconsistent with the actual performance, the statement said. Wahler said new measures have been implemented to prevent that from happening again. She did not elaborate. In a video of the performance posted on Twitter, members of the drill team are seen tapping their hands over their mouths and whooping, as a drum pounds in the background, in what is stereotypically called a “war cry.” Port Neches-Groves school district Superintendent Mike Gonzales and Indianettes director Cortnie Schexnaider did not immediately return messages seeking comment. However, the district issued a statement to KFDM-TV in Beaumont in which district officials said they are “aware of the concern regarding the performance of our band and Indianettes at Disney World.” ""We are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in our school district. Our district is nearing 100 years old, and our Board of Trustees is committed to always making the best decisions for our students, staff, and the communities of Port Neches and Groves,” the district stated. According to a PN-G spokesperson, this is the 8th time that PN-G performed the routine at Disney World. The spokesperson says Disney has never asked ahead of time about the planned performance. Port Neches is a petrochemical refining center located near the Gulf Coast about 13 miles (20 kilometers) southeast of Beaumont, Texas.

3/19/2022,"The family of the 13-year-old who was driving a pickup truck in a Texas crash that killed nine, including New Mexico college golfers, “lost everything” in a fire late last year, according to a local pastor. The unidentified boy died in the Tuesday night collision along with his dad, Henrich Siemens, a 38-year-old passenger in the truck. Mennonite Evangelical Church Seminole Pastor Jake Fehr told NBC News on Friday that Siemens was the father of the boy. Fehr knew Siemens growing up, and the father and son’s funerals will be held at Mennonite Evangelical Church Seminole, even though they attended South Seminole Baptist Church. Fehr's sanctuary has more space. Fehr said the Siemens’ house burned down late last year. “The whole house burned down, they lost everything in that home,” he said, adding that the 13-year-old had siblings. Details on the fire and what caused it were not available Friday. Agatha Siemens, Henrich’s wife, had posted on Facebook in December asking for help getting photos off of her computer, which was damaged in the fire. ""My laptop was in the house during the fire but didn’t get burnt. Just water damaged. So I’m afraid to turn it on or charge it but would like to transfer all the pics I have on it to flash drives so I don’t lose them. Anyone know of someone?"" she asked.

""Love of my life,"" ""my best friend,"" ""Love you so much,"" said text on the picture. The truck the 13-year-old was driving had a spare wheel in place of its left front tire, National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg said Thursday. That spare tire seemed to have failed, causing the truck to swerve in front of a van carrying members of New Mexico's University of the Southwest men and women’s golf teams Tuesday night. Six students and their coach died in the crash. Two students were flown to a Lubbock hospital in critical condition and were stable as of Thursday.

3/19/2022,"About three dozen would-be asylum seekers from Russia found themselves blocked from entering the U.S. on Friday while a group of Ukrainians flashed passports and were escorted across the border. The scene reflected a quiet but unmistakable shift in the differing treatment of Russians and Ukrainians who enter Mexico as tourists and fly to Tijuana, hoping to enter the U.S. for a chance at asylum. The Russians — 34 as of Friday — had been camped several days at the busiest U.S border crossing with Mexico, two days after city of Tijuana officials gently urged them to leave. They sat on mats and blankets, checking smartphones, chatting and snacking, with sleeping bags and strollers nearby as a stream of pedestrian border crossers filed past them. Five young girls sat and talked in a circle, some with stuffed animals. Days earlier, some Russians were being admitted to the U.S. at the San Ysidro crossing, while some Ukrainians were blocked. But by Friday, Russians were denied while Ukrainians were admitted after short waits. “It’s very hard to understand how they make decisions,” said Iirina Zolinka, a 40-year-old Russian woman who camped overnight with her family of seven after arriving in Tijuana on Thursday. Erika Pinheiro, litigation and policy director for advocacy group Al Otro Lado, said the U.S. began admitting all Ukrainians on humanitarian parole for one year around Tuesday, while at the same time blocking all Russians. There was no official announcement. A Homeland Security Department memo dated March 11 but not publicly released until Thursday told border officials that Ukrainians may be exempt from sweeping asylum limits designed to prevent spread of COVID-19. It says decisions are to be made case-by-case for Ukrainians but makes no mention of Russians. “The Department of Homeland Security recognizes that the unjustified Russian war of aggression in Ukraine has created a humanitarian crisis,” the memo states. Russian migrants in Tijuana sat off to the side of a line of hundreds of border residents waiting to walk across the border to San Diego on Friday. The line was unimpeded. A 32-year-old Russian migrant who hadn’t left the border crossing since arriving in Tijuana with his wife about five days earlier had no plans to leave, fearing he may miss any sudden opportunity. Within hours of arriving, the migrant, who identified himself only as Mark because he feared for his family's safety in Russia, saw three Russian migrants admitted to the United States. After six hours, U.S. authorities returned his passport and said only Ukrainians were being admitted. “Ukrainians and Russians are suffering because of one man,” Mark said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He fled shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. U.S. officials have expelled migrants more than 1.7 million times since March 2020 without a chance to see asylum under sweeping authority aimed at preventing spread of COVID-19. But the public health authority, known as Title 42, is seldom used for migrants of some nationalities who are difficult to expel for financial or diplomatic reasons. But to claim asylum, migrants must be on U.S. soil and U.S. officials are blocking passage except for those it wants to admit. Even before Russia’s invasion, the United States was seeing an increase in Russian and Ukrainian asylum seekers,  most trying to enter at official crossings in San Diego rather than trying to cross illegally in deserts and mountains. More than 1,500 Ukrainians entered the U.S. on the Mexican border from September through February, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, about 35 times the 45 Ukrainians who crossed during the same period a year earlier. Ukrainians who can reach U.S. soil are virtually guaranteed a shot at asylum. Only four of the 1,553 who entered in the September-February period were barred under the public health order that lets the U.S. expel migrants without a chance at humanitarian protection. The number of Russian asylum seekers entering at U.S land crossings from Mexico surpassed 8,600 from September through February, about 30 times the 288 the same time a year earlier. All but 23 were processed under laws that allow them to seek asylum. Mexican officials have been wary of migrants sleeping at the border. Last month they dismantled a large migrant camp in Tijuana with tents and tarps that blocked a walkway to San Diego. Eager to stop another camp from forming, the city distributed a letter on Wednesday asking migrants to leave their campsites for health and safety reasons and offered free shelter if they couldn't afford a hotel.",World/Associated Press,"Russians are blocked at US border, Ukrainians are admitted",https://news.yahoo.com/russians-blocked-us-border-ukrainians-221951267.html
3/19/2022,"Tokyo school officials announced they are dropping controversial dress code policies for high school students, including those regulating hairstyles and underwear color and patterns.

Around 200 schools run by the Tokyo metropolitan government will implement five changes to the rules at the start of the new academic year beginning on April 1, according to a Mainichi Shimbun report.

The new changes will scrap long-held rules that prevented high school students from changing their hair color or wearing a “two-block,” a hairstyle that is long on top and short at the back and sides.

Tokyo’s metropolitan government will also drop rules dictating underwear color, the “practice of punishing students with a form of house arrest” and “ambiguous language in the guidelines on what is considered ‘typical of high school students.’”

Yuto Kitamura, a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Board of Education, said these changes signal a “major step forward,"" according to Mainichi Shimbun. While Kaori Yamaguchi, another member of the board, praised the move, she said it took the government too long to address the issue.

“Japanese people have been taught to believe that it is a virtue to simply abide by the rules,” Yamaguchi said. “I hope this will be an opportunity for people to discuss what we should do to create a society where rules are observed in a way that’s acceptable to everyone.”

The recent changes came after Tokyo’s Board of Education surveyed 240 schools in the city, asking parents and students about their views of the policies. The result found that the majority of people in education and students believed the 216 regulations were outdated.

Some schools are expected to retain a few of the rules, reportedly at the request of parents and students, including showing proof that a student’s hair is naturally curly or a certain color.

Students in Fukuoka, on the island of Kyushu, also answered a survey about the similar dress code in their city, stating their complaints that the rules had caused them stress and limited their self-expression.

The issue was first brought to the public’s attention in 2017 after an Osaka student, then 18, filed a lawsuit against the government for forcing her to dye her naturally brown hair black, which irritated her scalp. She won the case in February 2021 and received 330,000 yen (approximately $3,190 at the time) in compensation.

Washington, which is seeking Beijing's help in restoring peace in Ukraine after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei, but is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier.

China sailed its aircraft carrier Shandong through the Taiwan Strait, shadowed by a U.S. destroyer, on Friday, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, just hours before the Chinese and U.S. presidents were due to talk. A White House statement said Biden reiterated in the call with Xi that U.S. policy on Taiwan has not changed, and emphasized that Washington ""continues to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo."" China has over the past two years stepped up its military activity near the island to assert its sovereignty claims. ""(We) hope the U.S. side will pay adequate attention (to the issue),"" Xi told Biden. Xi also told Biden that the war in Ukraine must end as soon as possible, according to Chinese state media.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday said rescue operations were underway. ""It is known that as of now, more than 130 people were rescued. But hundreds of Mariupol residents are still under the debris. Despite the shelling, despite all the difficulties, we will continue rescue work.""

3/19/2022,"When an aging Abe Osheroff recalled why, as a 21-year-old kid from Brooklyn’s Brownsville neighborhood, he had volunteered to join the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War in 1936, he framed it as a personal, ethical decision. “Some of my friends were already going over. Some of them had been killed and wounded. … Then I began to see pictures of what was going on. … Bombardments, civilians getting plastered all over the place. … I knew that if I didn’t go, I’d be ashamed all my life.” Today, his words seem to echo those of individuals from around the world who are willing to risk their lives to help Ukraine in its desperate struggle against the Russian invasion. “Sitting by and doing nothing? I had to do that when Afghanistan fell apart, and it weighed heavily on me. I had to act,” a U.S. veteran confessed to a New York Times reporter before he headed east. Encouraged by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, volunteers are signing up – according to some reports, by the thousands – to join the ranks of what The Guardian has called “the most significant international brigade since the Spanish civil war.” The Guardian is not the first to draw an analogy between 1930s Spain and today’s Ukraine. But tempting as it is to compare the two, doing so does more to obscure than to explain either of the conflicts. In some instances, I see the analogy relying on distorted frames inherited from the Cold War; in others, it seems to be driven by blatant opportunism. The Spanish Civil War broke out in the summer of 1936 after an attempted military coup, led by Gen. Francisco Franco, failed to overthrow the government of the Popular Front, a liberal-progressive coalition that had been democratically elected to lead the Second Spanish Republic. But while the Republican government managed to hold on to Spain’s largest cities and about half of the national territory, the right-wing rebels took control of the other half. They proceeded to wage a bloody war. Republican forces faced a well-equipped rebel army that Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy had supplied with soldiers, planes, weapons and tanks. By contrast, other democracies left the republic to fend for itself, with more than two dozen countries signing a nonintervention pact. The republic was also shut out of the international arms market, leaving only the Soviet Union and Mexico as sources of military support. After the republic’s defeat in 1939, a repressive military dictatorship headed by Franco ruled Spain for the next 36 years. Osheroff was one of roughly 2,800 U.S. volunteers – and more than 35,000 from around the world – who flocked to Spain to help fight fascism. These foreign fighters were largely recruited through communist organizations, although many were not communists. What they had in common was their staunch opposition to everything fascism stood for. Upon arriving in Spain, the volunteers became fully integrated members of the Spanish Republican Army, where most of them served in one of five International Brigades. As a scholar of the Spanish Civil War and its legacy, I can see why many people would be tempted to read the war in Ukraine through a Spanish lens. Much as in civil war Spain, Ukrainian cities are being bombarded and civilians are dying, while those attacked are putting up an unexpectedly persistent defense against a much stronger enemy. As in Spain, the war is producing seemingly unending streams of refugees. And, as in Spain, the war seems to reflect an unusual degree of moral clarity – “It’s a conflict that has a clear good and bad side,” one U.S. veteran told The New York Times – while the fate of the world seems to hang in the balance. Yet historical analogies are never perfect, rarely useful and often misleading. For one thing, the geopolitics of today has little connection to the 1930s. In 1936 there was no NATO, only a weak and ineffectual League of Nations, and no threat of nuclear war. Furthermore, the volunteers who joined the International Brigades in 1936 from Europe, the Americas, the Middle East and Asia had little in common with the combat veterans and Ukrainian nationalists who are signing up today, and whose politics, as NPR has reported, are vague and may skew to the right or far right. While the Russian invasion clearly violates Ukrainian sovereignty, those defending Ukraine represent ideologies that cover the entire political spectrum. By contrast, very few of the volunteers in Spain had military training or experience. And if Osheroff knew that the Spanish war was also his to fight, it was, as he explained, because he’d grown up steeped in progressive politics. He and his fellow brigaders were driven by the internationalist solidarity that’s the bedrock of the labor movement, but they also knew they had a personal stake in the struggle. Many of them were Jews and immigrants; they belonged to a generation that, as the historian Helen Graham has written, was resisting “attempts, by fascism, either alone or in coalition, violently to impose ethnic and class hierarchies both old and new across the whole continent.” The analogy falters in other ways as well. The half-million Spanish refugees who fled Spain in the last months of the war were not welcomed with open arms. The French government put them in concentration camps, while most countries around the world closed their borders, with some notable exceptions, such as Mexico. During Germany’s occupation of France, as many as 15,000 of the Spanish Republicans interned in France were deported to Nazi camps, where some 5,000 died. And yet in 1945, as Europe was liberated from fascism, the Allies decided to leave Franco alone and let him retain his grip on Spain. By the 1950s, Franco had become a U.S. ally in the Cold War. That same Cold War reshaped how the story of the Spanish Civil War was told. In the U.S., it became common to paint the anti-fascist volunteers as communist dupes. In 1984, U.S. President Ronald Reagan famously said the Americans in Spain had joined the wrong side. [You’re smart and curious about the world. So are The Conversation’s authors and editors. You can read us daily by subscribing to our newsletter.] Prompted by the Ukraine war, some of these Cold War clichés are slipping back into mainstream journalism. The New York Times reporter covering Zelenskyy’s international fighters, for instance, wrote that the adventure of the Americans in Spain, “often romanticized as a valiant prelude to the fight against the Nazis,” had “ended badly.” In reality, many of those who fought fascism in Spain went on to join the Allied armies in World War II. Others formed the backbone of the resistance movements in Nazi- and fascist-occupied territories. Invoking the Spanish Civil War to frame the invasion of Ukraine as a clash between fascism and anti-fascism, moreover, plays into the Kremlin’s narrative, which seeks to portray the “special military operation” as an effort to “denazify” its western neighbor. Ironically, one of the most opportunistic invocations of the historical analogy occurred in Spain itself. In early March 2022, when Spain’s progressive governing coalition decided to send arms to the Zelenskyy government, the country’s largest newspaper, El País, ran a supportive editorial stating: “Today, the weapons to defend Ukraine are the weapons that the Second Spanish Republic did not have 80 years ago.” In fact, the controversial decision to provide arms was dividing the governing coalition; the paper’s heartstrings-tugging invocation of the embattled Spanish Republic was an obvious attempt to end the debate. If there is one way in which the Ukrainian analogy with Spain applies, it is the tragic way the country is being used as a proxy in a battle between the world’s great powers. In July 1937, Dutch filmmaker Joris Ivens, journalist Martha Gellhorn and novelist Ernest Hemingway visited the White House to screen “The Spanish Earth,” Ivens’ documentary about the war. After seeing the film, Gellhorn recalled in a 1938 letter that President Franklin D. Roosevelt remarked, “Spain is a vicarious sacrifice for us all.” The same terrible fate seems to be reserved for Ukraine and its people.

The Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman said in an interview that he didn't know how to live, three weeks after coming under sanctions, Bloomberg reported. Fridman, who has a net worth of $10.1 billion, Bloomberg's Billionaires Index said, was sanctioned by the European Union on February 28 and by the UK on March 15. He described the EU's sanctions as ""groundless and unfair"" at the time and said he would contest them, Reuters reported.

Video: People worldwide are protesting Russia's invasion of Ukraine Fridman, a cofounder of the London investment firm LetterOne and former board member of the Russian banking company Alfa-Bank, told Bloomberg that the sanctions meant that his last working UK bank card was frozen. Fridman, who lives in the UK, has an allowance of 2,500 pounds ($3,300) per month and has to apply for a license to spend money before the British government decides how reasonable the request is, he told Bloomberg. ""My problems are really nothing compared with their problems,"" he told Bloomberg, referring to Ukrainians trapped in the conflict. Fridman resigned from the board of Alfa-Bank one day after the EU sanctioned him. He also stepped down from the board of directors of LetterOne, the investment firm he cofounded. Fridman said he thought he had a good relationship with the West because of his trips to Washington and an Alfa-Bank fellowship program he set up for American, British, and German citizens in 2004. ""We sincerely believed we are such good friends of the Western world that we couldn't be punished,"" he told Bloomberg.

3/19/2022,"U.S. Olympic figure skater Alysa Liu and her father Arthur Liu — a former political refugee — were among those targeted in a spying operation that the Justice Department alleges was ordered by the Chinese government, the elder Liu says. Arthur Liu told The Associated Press he had been contacted by the FBI last October, and warned about the scheme just as his 16-year-old daughter was preparing for the Winter Olympics that took place in Beijing in February. The father said he did not tell his daughter about the issue so as not to scare her or distract her from the competition. “We believed Alysa had a very good chance of making the Olympic team and truly were very scared,” Arthur Liu said late Wednesday. The Justice Department earlier in the day announced charges against five men accused of acting on behalf of the Chinese government in a series of brazen and wide-ranging schemes to stalk and harass Chinese dissidents in the United States. Arthur Liu said he and his daughter were included in the criminal complaint as “Dissident 3” and “family member,” respectively. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said he was “not aware of the specifics"" surrounding the allegations, and said China is “firmly opposed to the U.S. slandering by making an issue of this out of thin air."" “China always asks Chinese citizens to abide by the laws and regulations of host countries, and we would never ask our citizens to engage in activities that violate local laws,"" Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing Thursday. “The so-called transnational harassment schemes are just trumped up."" Liu said he took a stand against China’s bullying by allowing his daughter to compete at the recent Olympic Winter Games, where she placed 7th in the women’s event. “This is her moment. This is her once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to compete at the Olympic Games. I’m not going to let them stop her from going and I’ll do whatever I can to make sure she’s safe and I’m willing to make sacrifices so she can enjoy the moment,” Arthur Liu said. “I’m not going to let them win — to stop me — to silence me from expressing my opinions anywhere.” The father said he agreed to let his daughter compete with assurances from the State Department and U.S. Olympic Committee that she would be closely protected while competing in China, with at least two people escorting her at all times. “They are probably just trying to intimidate us, to ... in a way threaten us not to say anything, to cause trouble to them and say anything political or related to human rights violations in China,” Arthur Liu said. “I had concerns about her safety. The U.S. government did a good job protecting her.” He said a man called him last November, months before the Olympics, claiming to be an official with the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee, and asked for his and his daughters’ passport numbers. Arthur Liu refused to provide them and said he would call his contact at Team USA the next day. “I didn’t feel good about it. I felt something fishy was going on,” Arthur Liu said. “From my dealings with the U.S. Figure Skating association, they would never call me on the phone to get copies of our passports. I really cut it short once I realized what he was asking for.” A spokesman for U.S. Figure Skating deferred comment to Team USA. The U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee in a statement to AP said: “The security of the U.S. delegation is our number one priority, and we work closely with our partners, including government agencies, to ensure athlete safety at the Games.” Arthur Liu said he does not remember being approached in person by Matthew Ziburis, who was arrested Tuesday on charges that include conspiring to commit interstate harassment and criminal use of a means of identification. Ziburis was released on a $500,000 bond. Prosecutors allege that Ziburis was hired to perform surveillance on the family and pose as a member of an international sports committee to ask Arthur Liu for a copy of his and Alysa Liu's passports by claiming it was a travel “preparedness check” related to COVID-19. The complaint said when Arthur Liu refused, Ziburis threatened to delay or deny them international travel. The elder Liu said he left China in his 20s as a political refugee because he had protested the Communist government following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Arthur Liu eventually settled in the San Francisco Bay Area, put himself through law school and nurtured one of America’s most promising athletes. His daughter visited their ancestral homeland for the first time while at the Olympics. Arthur Liu said his daughter has generally been warmly embraced by Chinese fans and media, who consider her to be one of their own. But through the spying investigation, he learned that China was aware of an Instagram message about human rights violations against the ethnic minority Uyghurs that his daughter once posted. During the Games, Alysa Liu also told her father that she was approached by a stranger late one night at a cafeteria after the free skate event, and that the man followed her and asked her to come to his apartment. “I’ve kind of accepted my life to be like this because of what I chose to do in 1989, to speak up against the government. And I know the Chinese government will extend their long hands into any corner in the world,” Arthur Liu said. “I’m going to continue to enjoy life and live life as I want to live. I’m not going to let this push me down and I’m not going to let them succeed.” ___ Follow AP journalist Sally Ho on Twitter at http://twitter.com/_sallyho.",U.S./Associated Press,"US Olympian Alysa Liu, father targeted in Chinese spy case",https://news.yahoo.com/u-olympian-alysa-liu-father-075859312.html
3/19/2022,"Sixteen GOP lawmakers voted against a House bill that seeks to promote public education on the history of Japanese Americans in World War II, including their incarceration in so-called “internment camps.”

The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Jay Obernolte of California — who is also a Republican — ultimately passed with 406 yeas on Wednesday, while 10 others did not vote.

Introduced as H.R. 6434, the bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a “Japanese American World War II History Network” within the National Park Service (NPS). Such a network will consist of all NPS units and programs related to Japanese American history and experiences in World War II.

Those experiences will include the persecuted group’s time in “relocation centers” and “confinement sites,” the bill said. Such terms, however, are controversial, with advocates advising against their use due to their failure to capture the harsh conditions endured by those forced into them.

The Republicans who voted against the bill include Reps. Lauren Boebert (Colo.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Michael Cloud (Texas), Louie Gohmert (Texas), Bob Good (Va.), Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), Andy Harris (Md.), Clay Higgins (La.), Trey Hollingsworth (Ind.), Doug LaMalfa (Calif.), Thomas Massie (Ky.), Mary Miller (Ill.), Ralph Norman (S.C.), Matt Rosendale (Mont.), Chip Roy (Texas) and Van Taylor (Texas).

The lawmakers had various reasons for registering their opposition. A spokesperson for LaMalfa told The Hill that while he generally supports the bill, there are concerns that a historical site in his district cannot sufficiently accommodate tourists at this time.

Harris said the House should prioritize other legislation. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Roy said the matter will better be handled by “private and charitable entities,” according to The Hill.

About 126,000 Japanese Americans were forced into concentration camps in World War II. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, issued the executive order following the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Rep. Bruce Westerman (Ark.), the leading Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee, acknowledged the bill’s significance in honoring Japanese Americans. “[It] will be an important tool to ensure that this history, no matter how painful it may be, is always remembered, and the important stories of interned Japanese Americans are told with honor and respect,” he said.

Aside from the bill, the House reportedly passed legislation that would preserve the concentration camps and create a grant program to promote education on Japanese American incarceration.

3/19/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) - Russia has lost any illusions about ever relying on the West and Moscow will never accept a world order dominated by the United States, which is acting like a sheriff seeking to call all the shots in a saloon bar, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. Western nations have imposed sweeping sanctions across Russia's financial and corporate sectors in response to Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, plunging Russia's economy into its gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. Lavrov, President Vladimir Putin's foreign minister since 2004, said the West's reaction to what Moscow has called a ""special military operation"" had illustrated that the West was completely dominated by the United States and that the European Union was largely powerless. ""If there was any illusion that we could one day rely on our Western partners, this illusion is no longer there,"" Lavrov told Russian state-funded RT in English. Russia would look eastwards, he said. STORY: Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko announced the curfew would be in place from 8 p.m. Tuesday to 7 a.m. Thursday after several apartment blocks were struck by Russian forces based outside the city.Three weeks into the Russian invasion, there is new talk of compromise from both Moscow and Kyiv, on a status for Ukraine outside of NATO.Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskiy said negotiations were becoming 'more realistic', and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also said there was some hope of compromise. ""What the Americans want is a unipolar world which would not be like a global village but like an American village - or maybe like a saloon where you know the strongest calls the shots,"" Lavrov said. He added that many countries such as China, India and Brazil did not want to be ordered around by ""Uncle Sam"" acting like a sheriff. Russia's invasion has killed thousands of people, displaced more than 3 million and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States, the world's two biggest nuclear powers. Lavrov's defiant response to the West's effort to isolate his country echoed that of Putin, who has indicated in recent days that the post-1991 era of Russian history has drawn to a close and that from now on Moscow will look to China, India and, increasingly, inwards. ""We will now have to rely only on ourselves and on our allies who stay with us,"" Lavrov said. ""We are not closing the door on the West - they are doing so."" As the Soviet Union crumbled and the Cold War ended, many in both Russia and the West hoped that the confrontations which had divided the post-World War Two world would recede or even be bridged. Putin says Moscow's actions in Ukraine were necessary because NATO's enlargement threatened Russia, and that Moscow needed to save Russian-speaking people in Ukraine from oppression.

3/19/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's military said on Thursday that it had spotted four large Russian amphibious warfare ships sailing close to its islands as they traveled west, possibly towards Europe. Pictures of the amphibious transports, typically used for landing expeditionary forces ashore, published by Japan's defence ministry showed what appeared to be military trucks loaded onto the deck of one of the vessels. We don't know where they are heading, but their heading suggest it is possible,"" a Japanese defence ministry spokesman said. Asked if they could be bound for Ukraine, he said ""it is possible"". A Japanese Self Defense Force maritime patrol first detected the Russian vessels, which can carry dozens of tanks other military vehicles and hundreds of troops, on Tuesday and monitored them as they passed West from the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan through the narrow Tsuruga Strait separating Japan's main Honshu island from Hokkaido island on Wednesday. It is unusual for Russian ships to pass through the strait so close to Japanese territory, the military spokesman said. Armed with anti-tank weapons supplied by the United States and other countries Ukrainian fighters have taken a heavy toll on Russian armour and fuel trucks, meaning Moscow, which describes its attack as a ""special operation,"" may need to reinforce its forces with new equipment. NATO allies, which have already supplied 20,000 anti-tank and other weapons to Ukraine, on Wednesday said they would keep helping the country resist the Russian attack.

 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Friday said Republicans would boot House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) from the committee altogether if they attain the majority in the midterm elections. At his press conference Friday, McCarthy accused Schiff of politicizing the committee, said he didn't warn the public about Ukraine or Afghanistan and alleged he lied about intelligence regarding President Biden's son Hunter Biden.

3/19/2022,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Despite three weeks of Russian bombardment, Ukraine has kept up a stiff defense of its cities by using Turkish-made drones to carry out pop-up attacks on the invaders with a lethal effectiveness that has surprised Western military experts. The Bayraktar TB2 unmanned aerial vehicles, which carry lightweight, laser-guided bombs, normally excel in low-tech conflicts, and Turkey has sold them to more than a dozen countries, including Azerbaijan, Libya, Morocco and Ethiopia. The drones have carried out unexpectedly successful attacks in the early stages of Ukraine's conflict with Moscow, before the Russians were able to set up their air defenses in the battlefield, said Jack Watling of the London-based Royal United Services Institute. “The (TB2s) shouldn’t be making a meaningful impact because they are medium altitude, slow-flying aircraft with a large electromagnetic signature and a large radar cross-section. And the Russians have very capable air defense systems, so they should be being shot down. The terrain is very open and gives good radar coverage,” Watling added. He said Ukrainian forces ""have been essentially flying in at a low-level and then coming up and raiding with them. So striking targets of opportunity.” Over time, as the Russians get more organized and push out their air defenses, Watling said “the freedom to employ those drones is diminishing. And so what we are now seeing is that the Ukrainians are having to be careful as to when they commit them.” In a briefing to Parliament on March 9, British Defense Minister Ben Wallace praised the drones, along with other weapons donated to Ukraine by the West. “One of the ways they are delivering close air support or actual fire in depth is through the Turkish TB2 UAVs, which are delivering munitions onto their artillery and indeed their supply lines, which are incredibly important in order to slow down or block the Russian advance,” Wallace said. The drones also have scored success on social media. Their aerial video of the destruction of Russian armored vehicles has become a key tool for Ukraine's information war. Vasyl Bodnar, Ukraine’s ambassador to Turkey, shared videos of drone attacks on Twitter, including one that appeared to show a convoy of destroyed Russian military vehicles. “Masallah” or “Praise be” he wrote in a caption on one of the videos. A video using a song titled “Bayraktar” ‒ with sounds of explosions timed to coincide with the beats ‒ has been uploaded on YouTube and played on Ukrainian radio. “So as long as they still fly in, as long as they’re still armed, they will be useful. They will mostly be useful for the propaganda side,” said Aaron Stein, director of research at the U.S.-based Foreign Policy Research Institute. “The videos have enraptured people because you can see an airstrike in high definition.” Turkey began selling the TB2 drones to Ukraine in 2019, and Kyiv used them in fighting Russian-backed separatists in the eastern Donbas region — a move that Moscow called “destabilizing.” Turkish officials have refused to disclose details of the drone sales to Ukraine, including how many were involved and whether Kyiv is being resupplied. Independent estimates put the number of TB2s in Ukraine at between 20 and 50. “I think Turkey’s actually in the front, but not at the center, at least not publicly, of this conflict,” said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program and senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in Washington D.C. “Its official policy regarding the war is what I would call ‘pro-Ukraine neutrality.’ It acts neutral. It wants the war to end, but it is militarily helping Ukraine. ... It has been selling these killer drones to Ukraine that are apparently doing an amazing job.” The drones ‒ priced under $2 million each according to estimates ‒ are produced by the Baykar defense company, which belongs to the family of Selcuk Bayraktar, the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Bayraktar is Baykar’s chief technical officer. The TB2 has been credited with helping tip the balance of conflicts in Libya, as well as to Turkey's ally Azerbaijan in fighting with Armenian-backed forces in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region in 2020. Ankara has also used the drones against Kurdish militants in Turkey and northern Iraq as well as against Kurdish fighters in Syria. Such less-expensive drones are likely to have a lasting impact on warfare as a useful tool of attrition, as well as being able to draw in the attention of more expensive enemy jets, Stein said. “I’d call it the Toyota Corolla of drones. ... It doesn’t do everything that your high-end sports car does, but it does 80% of that, right?” he said. “So even for a high-end military, like the U.S., the basic concept of using in an attritable, cheap platform to strike a superior force has inherent value.” An unspecified number of U.S.-made drones will be among the additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine announced Wednesday by President Joe Biden. It also includes 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, 100 grenade launchers, 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition, and grenade launchers and mortar rounds. The White House has been weighing giving Ukraine access to U.S.-made Switchblade drones that can fly and strike Russian targets, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. It was not immediately clear if the new drones that Biden said would be delivered to Ukraine include those or others. ___ Gatopoulos reported from Athens, Greece.

3/19/2022,"By Mike Stone WASHINGTON (Reuters) - European governments have approached the U.S. government and defense contractors with a shopping list of arms including drones, missiles and missile defenses as the Russian invasion of Ukraine drives renewed demand for U.S. weaponry. Germany, which is nearing a deal for 35 Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 jet fighters, has inquired about systems to defend against ballistic missiles, sources familiar with the situation said. Meanwhile, Poland urgently wants to purchase sophisticated Reaper drone systems from the United States, a Polish government official said this week. Requests are also coming in from other countries in Eastern Europe, where allies are keen to acquire weaponry that Ukraine has successfully used against Russia forces, two people familiar with the demand said, including anti-aircraft Stinger missiles and anti-tank Javelin missiles. The inquiries comes as countries in Europe boost defense budgets to meet an increasingly uncertain security outlook, with Germany, Sweden and Denmark among those promising a sharp increase in spending. European allies are ""doubling down"" on their defense spending, Mara Karlin, a Pentagon assistant secretary of defense, said last week after a congressional hearing where she spoke of ""Russian aggression that threatens the territorial integrity of Europe."" Since the sale of arms by U.S. contractors to foreign governments requires U.S. approval, the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Administration is having weekly meetings of its European Crisis Management Team to review specific requests related to the current situation in Ukraine, a source said. To speed up U.S. government approval for sales and transfers of arms produced by American defense contractors, the Pentagon has re-established a team to respond to the increased demand. ""The Department of Defense is exploring options to support Ukraine's needs, rapidly replenish U.S. inventories and backfill depleted stocks of allies and partners,"" a senior Defense official said, adding that the Pentagon was working with contractors on ways to ""mitigate supply chain constraints (and) accelerate production timelines."" Raytheon Technologies and Lockheed Martin Corp jointly produce Javelins, while Raytheon makes Stingers. The potential for a surge in sales of all types of weaponry since the invasion began Feb. 24 has lifted Lockheed stock 8.3% and Raytheon shares 3.9%. Raytheon executive Tom Laliberty said the company recognizes ""the urgent need to replenish depleted inventories of Javelin and Stinger."" Any significant shift toward the United States as a supplier is likely to trigger a backlash from Europe's fragmented defense industry. The head of Dassault Aviation earlier this month lambasted the German decision to order the F-35, saying it could weaken support for collaborative projects like the Franco-German FCAS fighter shared by Dassault and Airbus. Germany is also examining U.S.-made missile defense systems like Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD), although that is not a frontrunner for purchase, a source said. An opposition politician, for example, has asked about the purchase of the short-range rocket interceptor called Iron Dome to protect Berlin. Decision-making on what to buy is in early stages. A German defense ministry spokesman declined to comment. Germany was already expected to decide on a new heavy lift helicopter this year, something increased spending could bring forward. Competitors for the approximately 4 billion euro deal include Lockheed Martin's CH-53K King Stallion and Boeing's H-47 Chinook. Poland wants to buy several MQ-9 Reaper drones made by General Atomics, including under a special, accelerated procedure, and is eyeing further procurements later, Lieutenant Colonel Krzysztof Platek, a spokesperson for the Polish Defence Ministry's Armament Agency, said in an interview on Wednesday. ""This order is an answer to (the) ... security situation, particularly in central and eastern Europe,"" Platek said. Typically, U.S. defense deals take years of negotiations, approvals and vetting after countries have spent up to several years deciding on their needs.

3/19/2022,"South Korean-born Russian short-track speed skater Viktor Ahn issued an apology after his wife’s skincare and cosmetics brand referred to Taiwan as a country.

The 36-year-old athlete, born Ahn Hyun-soo in Seoul in 1985, faced backlash from Chinese social media users over the weekend after they discovered that the website of the brand founded by his wife, Woo Na-ri, referred to Taiwan as a country.

In his apology letter on Weibo on Monday, Ahn said the “wrong information shown” on his wife’s website for her brand Nari “has been fixed.”

 

“I had a very pleasant time as a coach in China and I appreciate all the support from speed skating fans and internet users,” Ahn continued in the letter. “My family and I firmly respect the one-China policy. I hope for people’s forgiveness.”

The issue reportedly became a trending topic on Weibo, amassingaround 20 million views as of this writing. Junlebao, a Chinese dairy brand, also announced that they recently cut ties with the Russian athlete as their brand ambassador due to the controversy.

Nari apologized on Monday for “the incorrect information on our website which causes harm to Chinese users.” The brand explained that their website was built by a third-party company, and they admitted that they ""did not notice the false information"" until it became a hot topic online.

 

“At the moment, we have asked the third party to correct the error in time and also decided to terminate the cooperation with them,” the statement continued. “Thanks for your criticism and corrections. Therefore, we want to once again apologize to our friends who have always been caring about and supporting us.”

Ahn is considered one of the top athletes in short-track speed skating history, with six Olympic gold medals to his name.

After a falling out with his South Korean team, Ahn reportedly moved to Russia in 2011 and became a citizen. He then competed for the Russian team at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. He retired in 2020 and was tapped to coach China’s national team for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.

Although Ahn issued an online apology, some social media users reportedly expressed dissatisfaction with his statement and called on the athlete to make the same statement outside of Weibo.

“I hope this is not another apology exclusively for Weibo users. If you truly think you are in the wrong here, please address the issue outside the Chinese internet,” a popular reply to Ahn’s Weibo post read.

Speaking to the Chinese state-runGlobal Times, Lü Chao, an expert on the Korean Peninsula at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, said that “it is in fact a good thing for him to apologize on time after the mistake,” especially considering his role as a transnational sports ambassador.

“It would be inappropriate for people to hold on to this,"" Lü added. “It is a normal reaction for people to have insensitive topics like this. But we need to be calm to see the situations at the moment, instead of hurting a person who has helped the country a lot.”

3/19/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Wednesday Joe Biden's claim that President Vladimir Putin was a ""war criminal"" for invading Ukraine was an unforgivable remark by the leader of a country which had killed civilians in conflicts across the world. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands, displaced more than 3 million and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States, the world's two biggest nuclear powers. In an exchange with a reporter on Wednesday, Biden said, ""Oh I think he is a war criminal,"" after initially responding with a ""no"" to a question about whether he was ready to call Putin that. ""Our president is a very wise, prescient and cultured international figure and head of the Russian Federation, our head of state,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when asked about Biden's remark. ""Such statements by Mr Biden are absolutely impermissible, unacceptable and unforgivable,"" Peskov said. ""The main thing is that the head of a state which has for many years bombed people across the world... the president of such a country has no right to make such statements."" Peskov said the United States had bombed defeated Japan in 1945, destroying the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japan surrendered six days later, ending World War Two. Around 200,000 people were killed instantly by the bombs and many more died from radiation sickness. MIGHT OF RUSSIA Russia warned the United States on Thursday that Moscow had the might to put the world's pre-eminent superpower in its place and accused the West of stoking a wild Russophobic plot to tear Russia apart. Dmitry Medvedev, who served as president from 2008 to 2012 and is now deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, said the United States had stoked ""disgusting"" Russophobia in an attempt to force Russia to its knees. ""It will not work - Russia has the might to put all of our brash enemies in their place,"" Medvedev said. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the United States and its European and Asian allies have slapped sanctions on Russian leaders, companies and businessmen, cutting off Russia from much of the world economy. Putin says that what he calls the special military operation in Ukraine was necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia, and Russia had to defend against the ""genocide"" of Russian-speaking people by Kyiv. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. The West says claims it wants to rip Russia apart are fiction. Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov told European Union lawmakers on Wednesday that they should recognise Putin as a war criminal. Russia says that despite sanctions it can fare well without what it casts as a deceitful and decadent West and that it will develop ties with other powers such as China.

3/19/2022,"Alaska lawmakers are assuring a Russian official who said the U.S. should return Alaska and other areas to Russia that that's just not happening. Russian parliament member Oleg Matveychev on a TV program addressed waves of sanctions against Russia in response to the country’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, saying leaders should “think about reparations.” “The harm these sanctions caused us cost money. Return of possessions, including possessions of the Russian Empire, Soviet Union and even parts of Russia that are now occupied by the United States,” Matveychev said on Sunday, according to the Anchorage Daily News. The host of the show asked Matveychev about the return of Alaska and Fort Ross, which was established by Russians in California, according to the California Department of Parks and Recreation. “This is my next point – recognizing Alaska, Fort Ross and Antarctica,” Matveychev responded, according to the Anchorage Daily News. “We actually discovered it, so it rightfully belongs to us.” The United States reached an agreement to purchase Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million in 1867. Alaska was admitted as a state in 1959. Alaska Sen.

3/19/2022,"When Justin Blauwet made his “once-in-lifetime discovery” while observing an engineering firm’s construction project, he knew what it was right away. That’s because he always had an interest in fossils and pre-historic animals, and his two young sons also have a “huge interest” in dinosaurs. What he had found was a woolly mammoth tooth, his employer DGR Engineering said, and officials later confirmed Blauwet had successfully identified his rare find. “I’m a ‘nerd’ like that,” he said in the company’s March 16 news release. The engineering firm said Blauwet was “performing construction observation on a lift station project” at property owned by Northwest Iowa Community College (NCC) on Friday, March 4 when he spotted the “clearly exposed” tooth on the ground. “This is something you don’t find on campus every day — a woolly mammoth tooth!!” NCC shared on Facebook. DGR Engineering says employees then contacted Paleontology Repository Instructor Tiffany Adrain with the University of Iowa for confirmation. “While discovery of mammoth remains is not uncommon in Iowa, once the bones and teeth are out in the open, they can fall apart and disappear quickly because they are not completely fossilized,” Adrain said, according to DGR. “This was a lucky find.” The tooth weighed in at 11.2 pounds and measures 11 inches by 7 inches by 4 inches. “This is an upper 3rd molar, probably a right,” Chris Widga, head curator at East Tennessee State University, said in the news release. “Based on the degree of wear, this animal was probably in its early 30s when it died.” The preserved tooth has likely been in the ground for over 20,000 years, since the Last Glacial Maximum, according to the news release. “Measures are being taken to protect the tooth from drying out too rapidly and possibly disintegrating,” DGR said. The city of Sheldon says the tooth belongs to NCC, and the university plans to donate it to the Sheldon Prairie Museum. “NCC already has many connections with its communities forged throughout the past half-century. When Blauwet discovered this woolly mammoth tooth, it uncovered an even deeper connection — one that now ties our campus property way back to the prehistoric era of the retreating glaciers,” said NCC President Dr. John Hartog in the release. “Since NCC is the public college for all of its communities, we are happy to display the tooth in the Sheldon Prairie Museum as a semi-permanently loaned display. “This way, everyone from across our service area can come to the museum to see and appreciate this artifact,” he continued. “We might display it at the College for special occasions, but we will house the artifact in the Sheldon Prairie Museum.” Sheldon Prairie Museum confirmed the tooth is “coming soon.” Sheldon is in the northwest corner of Iowa, about 225 miles from Des Moines.

3/19/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Three Russian oligarchs who said their reputations were smeared by a dossier of opposition research examining Donald Trump's ties to Russia have agreed to dismiss their defamation lawsuit, according to a notice filed in federal court on Friday. Businessmen Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and German Khan sued Fusion GPS, a research and intelligence firm, and one of its founders, Glenn Simpson, in 2017. The men, cofounders of Russia-based Alfa Bank, alleged they had been defamed by various statements in a Democratic-funded dossier that Fusion had commissioned former British spy, Christopher Steele, to produce on the relationship between Trump and the Kremlin. The Steele dossier has been largely discredited since its publication, with core aspects of the material exposed as unsupported and unproven rumors. A special counsel assigned to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe has charged one of Steele's sources for the dossier with lying to the FBI, and has also charged a cybersecurity lawyer who worked for Hillary Clinton's campaign with lying to the FBI during a 2016 meeting in which he relayed concerns about Alfa Bank. But recent sanctions filed against the oligarchs and the bank amid Russia's war with Ukraine may have complicated their path toward proving defamation. On Tuesday, lawyers for Fusion GPS asked a federal judge to dismiss the case, noting that sanctions “illustrate in stark detail that the alleged defamatory statements are true, and surely must persuade any reasonable trier of fact that none of these Plaintiffs will ever succeed in meeting their burden of proving these statements false.” The United Kingdom included all three men in a round of sanctions this week, saying it was “going further and faster than ever in hitting those closest"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Treasury Department last month sanctioned Alfa Bank and other Russian financial institutions, and the EU has sanctioned Aven and Fridman. Alfa Bank has said that Fridman and Aven have stepped down from the board and that Khan has left the list of beneficiaries. The oligarchs gave no explanation for the dismissal, but their lawyers said in a single-sentence filing Friday that both sides had stipulated that the court action be “dismissed with prejudice as to all claims, causes of action, and parties, with each party bearing that party’s own attorneys’ fees and costs.” A lawyer for the plaintiffs didn't immediately return a message seeking comment. Joshua Levy, a lawyer for Fusion GPS and Simpson, said in a statement “that we are pleased that the plaintiffs decided to abandon their case after 4.5 years of needless litigation.” “At core, the oligarch owners of Alfa Bank took issue with the observation that they were close to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and amassed incredible wealth as a result of that association,” the statement continued. “Official statements explaining recent economic sanctions imposed on the plaintiffs by the European Union and the UK, we believe, confirmed that truth.” ____ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP",World/Associated Press,Oligarchs drop defamation lawsuit over Trump-Russia dossier,https://news.yahoo.com/oligarchs-drop-defamation-lawsuit-over-205032561.html
