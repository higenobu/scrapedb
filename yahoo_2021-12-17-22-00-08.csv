12/17/2021,"Tucker Carlson falsely claimed this week that more US women were in work than men. Carlson used a graph showing more than 80% of women were in work, which is untrue. As of November, 67.8% of men and 56.2% of women were in work, US government data shows. Fox News host Tucker Carlson used an inaccurate graph Thursday night to falsely argue that more US women are in work that men. During a segment in which he attacked the labor policies of President Joe Biden, Carlson claimed that unemployment benefits and COVID-19 stimulus measures had driven people to quit their jobs. ""Our labor markets have been getting sicker for generations,"" Carlson said. The host then showed two graphs, one showing that male participation in the workforce had dropped since the 1950s to around 65%, which is accurate. His second graph showed that 80% of women were currently in work, which is untrue. US Bureau of Labor Statistics data from November shows that 67.8% of men are in work, compared to 56.2% of women. The segment starts at the 9:37 mark. The lines on both graphs used by Carlson were accurate, showing a direction of change in the US workforce which is true. But the values for the female labor force graph were wrong. The y-axis showing women's participation in the workforce should have started at 30% and ended at 65%, because women's workforce participation bottomed out at 30% in the 1950s and has not gone above 61% since. Instead it used the same scale as the male participation graph, making the data wildly incorrect. The error was first reported by The Daily Beast. Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ""As you can tell, for 70 years we've been losing men in the workforce,"" Carlson said, who said that work was crucial for men to stay happy. ""It's a problem, the average man defines himself by his job ... They need to work, they tend to fall apart when they don't work,"" he said. ""Many call this progress on the assumption that anything bad and degrading for men must be good for America, but it is not progress,"" Carlson said.

12/17/2021,"A study by Oregon researchers finds that people fully vaccinated against COVID-19 who have a breakthrough infection end up with what the authors call ""super immunity."" They caution the vaccinated should not seek COVID-19 infection, but the ""hybrid immunity"" offers some solace for those who catch one despite having been vaccinated. ""The bottom line of the study is that vaccine provides you with foundational immunity for whatever comes next,"" said Fikadu Tafesse, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology in the Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine in Portland, Oregon. The study matched 26 vaccinated Oregon Health & Science University staff people who had breakthrough infections with a similar group who were vaccinated but hadn't had COVID-19. The people who were vaccinated and then got COVID-19 showed a substantial increase in antibody levels, said Tafesse. ""The increases were substantial, up to a 1,000% increase and sometimes up to 2,000%, so it's really high immunity,"" he said. ""It's almost 'super immunity.'"" Multiple other studies have shown that infection with COVID-19 followed by one dose of the vaccine is very protective against re-infection. “This is one of the first that shows a breakthrough infection following vaccination generates stronger immunity than prior infection or vaccination alone,” said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco. While possibly equally protective, the reverse order is not recommended. Getting COVID-19 before being vaccinated is dangerous because “we cannot predict who will get very ill with COVID,” Gandhi said. As the highly contagious omicron variant continues to spread in the United States, the findings will be of interest to many, and ""is likely what the future will hold for most vaccinated individuals,"" Gandi said. Omicron appears to be able to infect even fully vaccinated people, though they so far appear to come down with mild or even asymptomatic cases of COVID-19. ""What we're saying is, we know life happens. If you happen to be exposed to the virus, you'll have this amazing immune response,"" Tafesse said. ""It mirrors the immunity response we get to the booster."" The finding shows what a good job the immune system does, said Shane Crotty, a professor at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California. Every time the immune system sees the vaccine or the virus, it is learning more and better able to fight it and potential other variants. “This is what the immune system evolved to do, to make guesses from something it’s been exposed,” he said. There is some information being spread online claiming that getting vaccinated after having recovered from COVID-19 is dangerous because it could overstimulate the immune system. ""That's completely made up, it's total rubbish,"" said Crotty. ""It was tested in all the vaccine trials. Getting vaccinated after COVID-19 exposure is totally safe."" Getting a booster is still safer than getting COVID-19, said Dr. Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group, particularly for those at risk for severe disease, including those over 70, people with diabetes and those with weakened immune systems. ""Best is getting three doses of an mRNA vaccine and never getting infected. Complications, including long COVID and transmission to others, represent a risk even in that scenario,"" Poland said. He offered a hierarchy of safety: Best scenario: Fully vaccinated and boosted, no infection upon exposure Next best: Fully vaccinated, boosted and asymptomatic or mild disease upon exposure/infection Next best: Fully vaccinated, boosted, moderate disease and attendant complication risks upon infection Worse: not fully vaccinated or boosted and risk severe disease/death and its risks upon infection For those who have had COVID-19 and don't think they need to get vaccinated, Crotty suggested thinking of it another way. ""If you get at least one dose of vaccine, you'll have the best immunity of anyone,"" he said. ""You'll have amazing immunity against omicron and any variant that's been identified.""

12/17/2021,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia on Friday published draft security pacts demanding NATO deny membership to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet countries and to roll back its military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe — bold demands that the U.S. and its allies already have rejected. The documents, which have been submitted to the U.S. and its allies earlier this week, also call for a ban on sending U.S. and Russian warships and aircraft to areas from where they can strike each other’s territory and demand a rollback on alliance drills near Russia. The tough demands appear certain to be rejected by the U.S. and its allies, which have emphasized that Russia doesn't have a say in NATO's enlargement. The alliance's secretary-general warned that any security talks with Moscow would need to take into account NATO concerns and involve Ukraine and other partners. The publication of the draft pacts come amid soaring tensions over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that has drawn Ukrainian and Western fears of an invasion. Moscow has denied plans to attack its neighbor, but demanded the West provide a set of legal guarantees precluding NATO’s expansion to Ukraine and other Russian neighbors and the deployment of the alliance's weapons there, a demand NATO has rejected. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that Russia’s relations with the U.S. and its NATO allies have approached a “dangerous point,” noting that alliance deployments and drills near Russia have raised “unacceptable” threats to its security. The draft pacts — a Russia-U.S. security treaty and a security agreement between Moscow and NATO — contain obligations to pull back weapons and refrain from drills near the borders between Russia and the alliance members. Ryabkov told reporters that Moscow proposed that the U.S. immediately start the talks on the proposed drafts in Geneva. The drafts would oblige Washington and its allies take an obligation to halt NATO's eastward expansion to include other ex-Soviet republics and rescind a 2008 promise of membership to Ukraine and Georgia. They also would preclude the U.S. and its allies from setting up military bases on the territories of Ukraine, Georgia and other ex-Soviet nations which aren't members of NATO. The draft agreement with NATO also contains a bold demand to roll back the alliance's troops deployments in Central and Eastern Europe, stating that the parties agree not to deploy any troops to areas where they hadn't been present in 1997, before NATO's eastward expansion started — except for exclusive situations of mutual consent. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999, followed in 2004 by Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and the former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In the following years, Albania, Croatia, Montenegro and North Macedonia also became members, bringing NATO’s total to 30 nations. A draft treaty with the U.S. contains a ban on the deployment of U.S. and Russian warships and aircraft to “areas where they can strike targets on the territory of the other party.” Moscow has long complained about patrol flights by U.S. strategic bombers near Russian borders and the deployment of U.S. and NATO warships to the Black Sea, describing them as destabilizing and provocative. Russia's draft also envisages a pledge not to station intermediate-range missiles in areas where they can strike the other party’s territory, a clause that follows the U.S. and Russian withdrawal from a Cold War-era pact banning such weapons. President Vladimir Putin raised the demand for security guarantees in last week’s video call with U.S. President Joe Biden. During the conversation, Biden voiced concern about a buildup of Russian troops near Ukraine and warned him that Russia would face “severe consequences” if Moscow attacked its neighbor. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday that the alliance had received the Russian draft documents, and noted that any dialogue with Moscow “would also need to address NATO’s concerns about Russia’s actions, be based on core principles and documents of European security, and take place in consultation with NATO’s European partners, such as Ukraine.” He added that the 30 NATO countries “have made clear that should Russia take concrete steps to reduce tensions, we are prepared to work on strengthening confidence building measures.” U.S. intelligence officials say Russia has moved 70,000 troops to its border with Ukraine and is preparing for a possible invasion early next year. Moscow has denied an intention to attack and accused Ukrainian authorities of planning an offensive to reclaim control of rebel-held eastern Ukraine — an allegation Ukraine has rejected. Fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine began after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. It has killed over 14,000 people and devastated Ukraine’s industrial heartland called Donbas. ___ Lorne Cook reported from Brussels.",World/Associated Press,Russia sets tough demands for US-NATO in draft security pact,https://news.yahoo.com/nato-sets-terms-working-russia-094641033.html
