4/15/2022,"KYIV, Ukraine — The flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, a guided-missile cruiser that became a potent target of Ukrainian defiance in the opening days of the war, sank Thursday after it was heavily damaged in the latest setback for Moscow’s invasion. Ukrainian officials said their forces hit the vessel with missiles, while Russia acknowledged a fire aboard the Moskva but no attack. U.S. and other Western officials could not confirm what caused the blaze. The loss of the warship named for the Russian capital is a devastating symbolic defeat for Moscow as its troops regroup for a renewed offensive in eastern Ukraine after retreating from much of the north, including the capital. The Russian Defense Ministry said the ship sank in a storm while being towed to a port. Russia earlier said the flames on the ship, which would typically have 500 sailors on board, forced the entire crew to evacuate. It later said the blaze had been contained and that the ship would be towed to port with its missile launchers intact. The ship can carry 16 long-range cruise missiles, and its removal from combat reduces Russia’s firepower in the Black Sea. It’s also a blow to Russian prestige in a war already widely seen as a historic blunder. Now entering its eighth week, Russia’s invasion has stalled because of resistance from Ukrainian fighters bolstered by weapons and other aid sent by Western nations. US unveils $800 million in weapons and equipment, plus training, for Ukraine The news of the flagship’s damage overshadowed Russian claims of advances in the southern port city of Mariupol, where they have been battling the Ukrainians since the early days of the invasion in some of the heaviest fighting of the war — at a horrific cost to civilians. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Wednesday that 1,026 Ukrainian troops surrendered at a metals factory in the city. But Vadym Denysenko, adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, rejected the claim, telling Current Time TV that “the battle over the seaport is still ongoing today.” It was unclear how many forces were still defending Mariupol. Russian state television broadcast footage that it said was from Mariupol showing dozens of men in camouflage walking with their hands up and carrying others on stretchers. One man held a white flag. Mariupol’s capture is critical for Russia because it would allow its forces in the south, which came up through the annexed Crimean Peninsula, to fully link up with troops in the eastern Donbas region, Ukraine’s industrial heartland and the target of the coming offensive. The Russian military continues to move helicopters and other equipment together for such a effort, according to a senior U.S. defense official, and it will likely add more ground combat units “over coming days.” But it’s still unclear when Russia could launch a bigger offensive in the Donbas. Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukraine in the Donbas since 2014, the same year Russia seized Crimea. Russia has recognized the independence of the rebel regions in the Donbas. The loss of the Moskva could delay any new, wide-ranging offensive. Maksym Marchenko, the governor of the Odesa region, across the Black Sea to the northwest of Sevastopol, said the Ukrainians struck the ship with two Neptune missiles and caused “serious damage.” Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukraine’s president, called it an event of “colossal significance.” Russia’s Defense Ministry said ammunition on board detonated as a result of a fire, without saying what caused the blaze. It said the “main missile weapons” were not damaged. In addition to the cruise missiles, the warship also had air-defense missiles and other guns. The Neptune is an anti-ship missile that was recently developed by Ukraine and based on an earlier Soviet design. The launchers are mounted on trucks stationed near the coast, and, according to the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, the missiles can hit targets up to 280 kilometers (175 miles) away. That would have put the Moskva within range, based on where the fire began. The U.S. was not able to confirm Ukraine’s claims of striking the warship, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Thursday. Still, he called it “a big blow to Russia.” “They’ve had to kind of choose between two stories: One story is that it was just incompetence, and the other was that they came under attack, and neither is a particular the good outcome for them,” Sullivan told the Economic Club of Washington. During the first days of the war, The Moskva was reportedly the warship that called on Ukrainian soldiers stationed on Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender in a standoff. In a widely circulated recording, the soldier responds: “Russian warship, go (expletive) yourself.” The AP could not independently verify the incident, but Ukraine and its supporters consider it an iconic moment of defiance. The country recently unveiled a postage stamp commemorating it. Russia invaded on Feb. 24 and has lost potentially thousands of fighters. The conflict has killed untold numbers of Ukrainian civilians and forced millions more to flee. It’s also further inflated prices at grocery stores and gasoline pumps because Ukraine and Russia are major producers of crops and energy, while dragging on the global economy. The head of the International Monetary Fund said Thursday that the war helped push the organization to downgrade economic forecasts for 143 countries. Also Thursday, Russian authorities accused Ukraine of sending two low-flying military helicopters across the border and firing on residential buildings in the village of Klimovo in Russia’s Bryansk region, some 11 kilometers (7 miles) from the frontier. Russia’s Investigative Committee said seven people, including a toddler, were wounded. Russia’s state security service had earlier said Ukrainian forces fired mortar rounds at a border post in Bryansk as refugees were crossing, forcing them to flee. The reports could not be independently verified. Earlier this month, Ukrainian security officials denied that Kyiv was behind an air strike on an oil depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, some 55 kilometers (35 miles) from the border.

4/15/2022,"Former Japanese Princess Mako Komuro now has a position at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

Mako is reportedly working in the museum’s Asian art collection as an unpaid volunteer, assisting curators prepare an exhibition of paintings related to a 13th century monk who traveled through Japan introducing Buddhism.

With a degree in art from International Christian University and a master's in art museums and gallery studies from the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom, Mako certainly has the qualifications to work at the Met.

Mako and her husband, Kei Komoro, moved to New York last year following their marriage in Japan last October that was publicly scrutinized due to Komoro’s commoner status. Mako, who was born a member of the royal family, married Komoro, renouncing her royal status as well as forfeiting a $1.3 million payout that she would have received had she married nobility.

The couple met in 2013 while studying at International Christian University and got engaged in 2017. Their marriage in 2021, a small civil ceremony in Tokyo, marked the first time in post-World War II Japan that a female royal got married without a traditional ceremony.

The union has been protested in Japan, with the media digging into Kei’s past and bringing up allegations of financial dishonesty against his mother. Comparisons to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who also made news for exiting the British royal family, have inevitably been drawn, with nicknames such as “Japan’s Harry and Meghan” being assigned to the couple.

According to the imperial household agency, Mako developed post-traumatic stress disorder over the widely negative media coverage and public criticism.

Her husband Komoro is an aspiring lawyer with a law degree from Fordham University and is currently working at the Lowenstein Sandler law firm in Manhattan. He is reportedly trying to pass the New York State bar exam.

The two live in a one-bedroom apartment in New York overlooking the Hudson River. It is reportedly just 10 minutes from the Met, and similar apartments in their building cost around $4,300 monthly.

4/15/2022,"Artem Severiukhin has had his racing license revoked by Italian motorsport authorities. Severiukhin appeared to make a Nazi salute while celebrating a Karting win in Portugal Sunday. The Automobile Club d'Italia said his actions undermined ""humanity, dignity and civil coexistence."" Artem Severiukhin, the 15-year-old Russian kart racer who appeared to make a Nazi salute on the podium of a recent race, has had his racing license revoked by Italian motorsport bosses, who accused him of showing a lack of respect for humanity. In a statement published Tuesday, the Automobile Club d'Italia (ACI) — Italy's motorsport governing body — said that after holding an extraordinary meeting of its sporting council, it had decided to take away Severiukhin's license. The Russian teenager has been competing under the Italian flag since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""Severiukhin has shown a lack of respect not only for the universal values that have always inspired every sport, but also for humanity, dignity and civil coexistence,"" the ACI's statement said, adding that the gesture was ""unspeakable and unacceptable."" Severiukhin caused outrage in the world of motorsport Sunday when he raised his arm in what seemed to be a Nazi salute, having taken victory in the opening round of the European Karting Championships, which took place in Portimao, Portugal. Standing on the podium to celebrate his win, Severiukhin pounded his chest before raising the salute, then bursting into laughter which lasted for several seconds. —Danny Armstrong (@DannyWArmstrong) April 11, 2022 After the apparent Nazi salute, Severiukhin was almost immediately dropped by his team, Ward Racing, and is currently under investigation by the FIA. He has since apologized for his conduct, calling himself a ""fool,"" but denying that he supports Nazism or fascism in any way. ""Standing on the podium, I depicted a gesture that many perceived as a Nazi greeting. But that's not true. I have never supported Nazism and consider it one of the worst crimes against humanity,"" he said in a statement on his Instagram page. ""I know it's my fault, I know I'm a fool, and I'm ready to be punished."" The removal of Severiukhin's license in Italy means that for the time being, he is likely unable to compete in any further events in the European karting season, unless another European nation is willing to grant him a new license. The ACI said it did not rule out further punishment for Severiukhin but did not specify what form that punishment could take.
