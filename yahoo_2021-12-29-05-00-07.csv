12/29/2021,"An LAPD officer is on leave after a shooting inside a Burlington that left a 14-year-old girl dead. Police say the officer fired three shots at 24-year-old Daniel Elena-Lopez and struck the girl. Bodycam footage shows officers tell the cop who shot Elena-Lopez to slow down before he opened fire. Los Angeles Police Department officers urged a colleague who shot and killed a suspect and a teen bystander inside a Burlington Coat Factory to ""slow down"" multiple times, body-camera footage released by the department on Monday showed. The department confirmed to USA Today that the officer who shot and killed Daniel Elena-Lopez, 24, and Valentina Orellana-Peralta, 14, was on administrative leave. The officers had responded to reports of a man attacking shoppers with a bike lock at the Burlington Coat Factory in North Hollywood on December 23. Police also released 911 calls on Monday in which an employee said that Elena-Lopez was ""breaking things"" around the store, and another employee told the operator that a ""hostile customer"" was ""going crazy."" Officer Drake Mason previously told Insider that Elena-Lopez was ""in the process of assaulting another person"" when police arrived. Body camera footage shows that as the officer who shot Elena-Lopez approached the suspect with a rifle, multiple colleagues yelled for the officer to ""slow down."" The officer can be seen holding a rifle and walking to the front of a group of three other officers who have their weapons drawn. ""Hey, slow down, slow down, let me take the point with the rifle,"" the officer says in the footage. After getting in front of the group, the officer with the rifle says, ""he's hitting her on the right-hand side,"" and runs ahead toward a woman who is bleeding on the ground. Body camera footage from the three other officers shows them yelling for the officer with the rifle to ""slow down"" and ""slow it down partner."" ""Slow it down,"" one yells. ""She's bleeding,"" the officer with the rifle responds. ""Slow it down Jones,"" another says before the officer with the rifle is shown firing three shots at a man who falls to the ground and waves his arms. Police have said that they believe Orellana-Peralta was also struck during this time. Captain Stacy Spell said that Orellana-Peralta was ""struck by a round which skipped off the floor and entered the dressing room wall."" The LAPD did not immediately respond Tuesday to Insider's request for comment. The department has not released the name of the officer who shot Elena-Lopez and Orellana-Peralta. In a statement on Thursday, Chief Michel Moore said he was ""profoundly sorry for the loss of this young girl's life.""

12/29/2021,"Former President Donald Trump may be losing some hard-core supporters over his recent endorsement of the COVID-19 vaccine, but at least one of his most outspoken allies still has his back. Far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., relayed Trump’s position on Twitter Monday, apparently attempting to assure skeptics that Trump’s promotion of the jab does not equal support for COVID-19 vaccine mandates. “I have President Trump’s permission to tell you all that he is 100% AGAINST the mandates, but he still encourages everyone to get the vaccine and booster,” Greene wrote, saying she had just spoken to him on the phone. “That is his position. He also said if he was President he would never mandate the vaccines, and no one would be fired [for not getting vaccinated].” While the freshman congresswoman did not go so far as to advocate getting inoculated against COVID herself, the post was notable in light of Greene’s own track record as both an opponent of the vaccine and a constant source of misinformation about the coronavirus. The tweet seems to reflect the awkward position many outspoken supporters of the former president have found themselves in as a result of his recent vaccine advocacy. At an event with former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly in Dallas on Dec. 19, Trump confirmed that he had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and revealed that he had received a third shot, a comment that prompted boos from some people in the audience. In another interview with conservative commentator Candace Owens later that week, Trump continued to tout the efficacy of the COVID vaccines, which were developed under his administration. “The vaccine is one of the greatest achievements of mankind,” Trump told Owens. “And if you take the vaccine, you’re protected. The results of the vaccine are good.” The comments drew immediate criticism from some prominent far-right figures, like conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who said Trump’s words were “nothing but a raft of dirty lies” and warned, “You are either completely ignorant ... or you are one of the most evil men who ever lived.” Others, like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and pro-Trump lawyer Lin Wood, attempted to defend Trump. In a statement to the Daily Beast last week, Lindell said that while he is “100% against the vaccine!” he wasn’t concerned about Trump’s support for it because “he is 100% against mandates!” Wood suggested Trump’s vaccine endorsement was part of his “wartime strategy” and urged followers to hold off on “passing judgment.” Even Owens seemed caught between supporting the former president and opposing the vaccine after her interview with Trump, saying that while she had “no issue with any person who wants to get the vaccine,” she did not trust it and would “never, ever” let it into her body. Monday’s messaging appeared to be Greene’s attempt to reconcile the recent comments made by her “favorite president of all time” with her own vociferous anti-vax stance. Greene, who has also promoted the pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy theory, was suspended from Twitter twice this year for sharing false or misleading claims about the coronavirus pandemic. In July, she was locked out of her account for 12 hours after saying COVID was dangerous only to those who were over 65 or obese. She was suspended again for a week in August for saying the vaccines were “failing” and ineffective, though Insider reported last week that she owned shares of three companies that produced vaccines. Greene has repeatedly compared those promoting mask and vaccine usage to Nazis, continuing to make the offensive analogy even after issuing a public apology for it. During an appearance on former Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s podcast last month, Greene once again railed against “vaccine Nazis” and stated proudly that she is “not vaccinated, and I’m not getting the vaccine because I’m an American.” The United States has seen an increase of more than 105 percent in COVID cases and 6 percent in hospitalizations over the last 14 days, per New York Times tracking. Experts have said they’re concerned about the potential of an additional post-Christmas surge following holiday gatherings, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying last month that the unvaccinated are 14 times more likely to die than those who’ve received the shots. Health officials hope the promotion of the vaccine by Trump could help close the partisan gap in those receiving the jabs. Per the Kaiser Family Foundation, only 59 percent of Republicans and 68 percent of independents are already vaccinated, versus 91 percent of Democrats. A study by NPR found that residents of counties that voted heavily for Trump in 2020 were nearly three times more likely to die of COVID-19 than those of counties that went for Joe Biden. Trump initially received the COVID-19 vaccine in January but did not publicize that fact, in contrast to officials from both parties who shared photos and videos in an attempt to promote others to follow suit. Trump has recommended that people get the vaccine multiple times over the course of the year, telling Fox News in March, “I would recommend it, and I would recommend it to a lot of people that don’t want to get it.” In August, Trump had called the boosters a “money-making operation” and the following month said he would “probably” not get one. In the early days of the pandemic, the then-president downplayed the virus, held large rallies, railed against mask mandates and promoted misinformation about treatments. In a Dec. 22 interview with Fox News, Trump noted his position against vaccine mandates, saying, “It’s a matter of getting people out to, ideally, get the vaccine. If you have the mandate, the mandate will destroy people’s lives — it destroys people’s lives, just as the vaccine saves people.” Trump’s anti-mandate stance is messaging shared by many in his party. Earlier this month, every Republican senator and two Democrats, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana, voted to nullify the White House’s vaccination and testing mandate for large private businesses. (The measure is unlikely to pass the Democratic-controlled House and could be vetoed by President Biden.) The White House has embraced Trump’s comments promoting the vaccine. “We’re grateful the former president got the booster,” press secretary Jen Psaki said during the Dec. 23 White House press briefing. “We’re also grateful that he made clear in a recent interview that they’re effective and they’re safe. That’s an important message for anyone to hear.” “It may be one of the few things he and I agree on,” Biden said. “People with booster shots are highly protected. Join them. Join us.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, told ABC News he was “dismayed” that Trump was booed, but he praised Trump’s comments. “I think that his continuing to say that people should get vaccinated and articulating that to them, in my mind, is a good thing,” Fauci said in a Sunday interview. “I hope he keeps it up.”",Politics/Yahoo News,"Marjorie Taylor Greene tries to explain Trump's pro-vaccine stance, bashes mandates",https://news.yahoo.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-tries-to-explain-trumps-pro-vaccine-stance-bashes-mandates-185001566.html
12/29/2021,"Amid another holiday season in the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans are once again trying to figure out how to safely gather and travel. The latest threat is the omicron variant, which accounts for more than 73% of new COVID-19 infections in the nation and has been canceling major events as well as forcing schools to go virtual. Most of the U.S. is in the red, showing high rates of transmission. Northern states such as New York, Illinois, Wisconsin as well as Florida, Georgia, Alabama are among areas hardest hit. Areas reporting lower transmission include underpopulated areas such as Wheeler County, Oregon, Trinity, Country, California and Wayne County, Mississippi. Vaccination efforts also vary by area. Vermont, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Maine and Connecticut continue to report the highest COVID-19 vaccination rates while Idaho, Alabama and Wyoming report the lowest. Need a COVID booster?: A guide to mixing and matching Pfizer, Moderna, J&J booster shots New COVID treatments are coming: Will they help combat the omicron onslaught The U.S. has recorded more than 52.7 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 818,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Global totals total more than 281.5 million cases and 5.4 million deaths. More than 205 million Americans – 61.8% – are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. As the omicron coronavirus variant accounts for the majority of new cases, the CDC is altering their medications and defense against the virus. The Food and Drug Administration authorized on Dec. 22 the use of Pfizer's Paxlovid, a series of pills, taken at home that prevent nearly 90% of severe COVID-19 among those at high risk. And on Dec. 23, the FDA authorized use of a second antiviral, molnupiravir, which appears to prevent progression to severe disease about 30% of the time. ""As we face omicron, the nation's medicine cabinet of treatments gives us more options to protect the American people,"" said Jeff Zients, the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator. ""We have tools to keep people safe and we will continue to use them. The demand of molnupiravir is coming from all states, including Texas where supplies are already low. The Texas Department of State Health Services announced on Dec. 27 that its regional infusion centers in Austin, El Paso, Fort Worth, San Antonio and The Woodlands have run out of the monoclonal antibody sotrovimab. CDC continues to recommend wearing a mask in public indoor settings in areas of high community transmission, regardless of vaccination status. Here's how the ratings break down overall by county: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Dec. 27 decreased the time it recommends people should isolate after testing positive for COVID-19 and quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tests positive. The new recommendations are for: Isolation: For those who are infected with COVID-19, isolation starts the day a person tests positive. The CDC now recommends isolating for five days and going back to normal activities if a person is not showing any symptoms after that period. Originally, the isolation period was 10 days. Quarantine: For those who come in close contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19. The CDC is now recommending those who are vaccinated and received a booster shot can skip quarantining if they wear a face mask for at least 10 days. If a person is vaccinated and has not gotten a booster, or if they are partly vaccinated or not vaccinated at all, the CDC recommends a five-day quarantine, then wearing a mask in public for an additional five days.

12/29/2021,"A 43-year-old woman was reportedly asked to change her seat from the exit row on a plane heading to Tennessee from Florida two days after Thanksgiving. She tried to leave the aircraft mid-flight instead, prosecutors said. Amanda Renee Henry, of Lebanon, Tennessee, was accused of disrupting other passengers before being asked to move. She then assaulted multiple crew members trying to restrain her before an off-duty fireman stepped in to help, prosecutors said. Henry is now charged with interfering with a flight crew in a criminal complaint unsealed Tuesday, Dec. 28, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Tennessee said in a news release. She surrendered to law enforcement the same day. “The prosecution of those who endanger the safety of airline passengers, flight crews, and flight attendants is a priority of this office,” U.S. Attorney Mark H. Wildasin said in the release. “Those whose behavior disrupts or otherwise endangers the safety of persons on aircrafts should expect to face federal charges.” Henry could not be reached by McClatchy News for comment, and information regarding her defense attorney was not immediately available. Prosecutors said the incident occurred Nov. 27 on a Spirit Airlines flight from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Nashville, Tennessee. Henry “became disruptive and appeared to be intoxicated” on the flight, the government said, and passengers next to her asked to be relocated. “Since Henry was seated next to an emergency exit, flight attendants decided for the safety of everyone on board to move Henry to another seat,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. Henry refused, the government said, grabbing her carry-on bag instead and barreling toward the front of the plane. “I’m getting off this plane,” she reportedly screamed. The flight crew intercepted Henry before she reached the cabin door, according to prosecutors, who said she then began to “kick and hit the flight attendant” blocking her exit. Henry is also accused of assaulting a second flight attendant trying to restrain her. Once they succeeded, prosecutors said, an off-duty firefighter who happened to be a passenger on the flight sat with Henry and kept her calm until the plane landed in Nashville. She was subsequently arrested by the Nashville Airport Department of Public Safety and charged with public intoxication. Henry faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if she’s convicted.

12/29/2021,"A Venezuelan businessman has sued Fox News, its former host Lou Dobbs, and Sidney Powell. Dobbs and Powell baselessly accused him of being involved in a plot to manipulate election results. In the lawsuit, the man says he isn't involved with the voting companies Dominion and Smartmatic. A Venezuelan businessman filed a defamation lawsuit this month against Fox News, its former host Lou Dobbs, and Sidney Powell, alleging they falsely implicated him in an election-rigging scheme and demanding $250 million in damages. The businessman, Majed Khalil, says Dobbs and Powell wrongly wrapped him up in their conspiracy theory that Smartmatic and Dominion Voting Systems — two rival election-technology companies — worked to rig the 2020 presidential election against then-President Donald Trump and in favor of now-President Joe Biden. Dobbs and Powell, in media appearances and social-media posts, both pushed elements of the false theory that alleged Khalil was once the ""COO"" of an operation to rig votes for the now-dead Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and that he was involved in a plot to rig the 2020 US presidential election as well. In reality, Smartmatic has publicly accused the Venezuelan government of tampering with the results of elections that used its software. According to Dobbs and Powell, the falsified Venezuelan election results were a forerunner to the 2020 election, which Dobbs described in a tweet as a ""cyber Pearl Harbor"" and ""electoral 9-11."" Dobbs also baselessly described Khalil as being a ""liaison with Hezbollah,"" and Powell continued to push the conspiracy theory in a November 8, 2020, appearance on the Fox Business show ""Lou Dobbs Tonight,"" according to the lawsuit. In the lawsuit, Khalil denied he had any affiliation with Smartmatic or Dominion and said he has never been involved in any US elections. The lawsuit also says that neither Powell nor Dobbs reached out to Khalil before making their allegations. Khalil's lawsuit went largely unnoticed when it was filed earlier in December in New York state court. Fox News successfully filed a motion to move it to Manhattan federal court, which has jurisdiction over the case because Khalil is a Venezuelan citizen, where it was docketed on December 2 and assigned to US District Judge Louis L. Stanton, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan. An attorney for Powell didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Powell's appearance on Dobbs' now-cancelled Fox News show, days after Biden had already won the 2020 presidential election, has been at the center of several defamation lawsuits that Fox News has fought in court. The company's attorneys are also representing Dobbs in all the election-related defamation litigation he faces. Smartmatic sued Fox News, Dobbs, and several other hosts in February, demanding $2.7 billion in defamation damages. Fox News canceled ""Lou Dobbs Tonight"" soon afterward, and Dobbs has since announced the launch of a podcast not affiliated with the network. A New York state judge is currently weighing a motion from Fox News to dismiss Smartmatic's lawsuit. Dominion, too, filed a lawsuit against Fox News, in March. A Delaware state judge denied Fox News's motion to dismiss the lawsuit earlier this month.
