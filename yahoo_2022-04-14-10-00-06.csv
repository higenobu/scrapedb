4/14/2022,"By Pavel Polityuk and Oleksandr Kozhukhar (Reuters) - Russia on Thursday said the flagship of its Black Sea fleet was seriously damaged and its crew evacuated following a fire that caused an explosion, as a Ukrainian official said the vessel had been hit by missiles. The incident on the Moskva missile cruiser occurred after ammunition on board blew up, Interfax news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying. ""As the result of a fire on the Moskva missile cruiser, ammunition detonated,"" it said in a statement. Maksym Marchenko, governor of the region around the Black Sea port of Odesa, said in an online post that the 12,500 tonne ship was hit by two missiles, without providing evidence. ""Neptune missiles guarding the Black Sea caused very serious damage,"" he said in an online post. Reuters was not able to independently verify either account. Ukraine warned late on Wednesday that Russia was ramping up efforts in the South and East as it seeks full control of Mariupol, in what would be the first major city to fall. Western governments are sending more military aid to bolster Kyiv. Russia's defence ministry on Wednesday said 1,026 soldiers from Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had surrendered in Mariupol, which has been besieged for weeks, and that the port was fully under its control. Capturing its Azovstal industrial district, where the marines have been holed up, would give the Russians full control of Ukraine's main Sea of Azov port, reinforce a southern land corridor and expand its occupation of the country's East. Ukraine's general staff said Russian forces were attacking Azovstal and the port, but a defence ministry spokesman said he had no information about any surrender. ""Russian forces are increasing their activities on the southern and eastern fronts, attempting to avenge their defeats,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Wednesday night video address. Reuters journalists accompanying Russian-backed separatists saw flames billowing from the Azovstal area on Tuesday, a day after Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade said its troops had run out of ammunition. The United States announced on Wednesday an extra $800 million in military assistance including artillery systems, armoured personnel carriers and helicopters. This took total U.S. military aid to more than $2.5 billion. France and Germany also pledged more. Senior U.S. officials are weighing whether to send a top cabinet member such as Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Austin Lloyd to Kyiv in a show of solidarity, a source familiar with the situation said. Russia will view U.S. and NATO vehicles transporting weapons on Ukrainian territory as legitimate military targets, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the TASS news agency. It will impose tit-for-tat sanctions on 398 members of the U.S. House of Representatives and 87 Canadian senators, Interfax cited the foreign ministry as saying, after Washington targeted 328 members of Russia's lower house of parliament. Britain announced new financial measures on separatists. 'LIBERATE US FROM WHAT?' Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol and accuses Russia of blocking aid convoys to civilians marooned there. Its mayor, Vadym Boichenko, said Russia had brought in mobile crematoria ""to get rid of evidence of war crimes"" - a statement that was not possible to verify. Moscow has blamed Ukraine for civilian deaths and accused Kyiv of denigrating Russian armed forces. In the village of Lubianka northwest of Kyiv, from where Russian forces had tried and failed to subdue the capital before being driven away, a message to Ukrainians had been written on the wall of a house that had been occupied by Russian troops. ""We did not want this ... forgive us,"" it said. The Kremlin says it launched a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""liberate"" Ukraine, a message villagers said had been repeated to them by the Russian troops. ""To liberate us from what? We're peaceful ... We're Ukrainians,"" Lubianka resident Viktor Shaposhnikov said. Polish President Andrzej Duda said on a visit to Kyiv with his Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian counterparts that those who had committed and ordered crimes must be brought to justice. Germany's president did not join them as he had planned. Zelenskiy said there had been no official approach and one of his officials denied a newspaper report he had rejected the visit due to Steinmeier's recent good relations with Moscow. BIDEN'S GENOCIDE COMMENTS The Kremlin denounced President Joe Biden's description of Moscow's actions in Ukraine as amounting to genocide, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying this was unacceptable coming from the leader of a country he said had committed crimes of its own. An initial report by a mission of experts set up by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe documents a ""catalogue of inhumanity"" by Russian troops in Ukraine, according to the U.S. ambassador to the OSCE. ""This includes evidence of direct targeting of civilians, attacks on medical facilities, rape, executions, looting and forced deportation of civilians to Russia,"" Michael Carpenter said. Russia has denied targeting civilians and has said Ukrainian and Western allegations of war crimes are fabricated. The Kyiv district police chief said 720 bodies had been found in the region around the capital from where Russian forces had retreated, with more than 200 people missing. The mayor of the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest, said bombing had increased significantly on Wednesday and satellite photos from Maxar Technologies showed long columns of armoured vehicles in the region. Ukrainian forces shot down two Russian planes attacking towns in the region, regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said earlier. Reuters could not immediately verify his statement but filmed people in Kharkiv quietly carrying bodies from an apartment block hit by shelling.

4/14/2022,"Russian soldiers gave up control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant earlier this month. Troops stationed there will ""feel the consequences"" of radiation poisoning soon, a Ukrainian official said. Yevhen Kramarenko said Russians dug trenches and drove into the most contaminated areas of the site. Russian troops who seized Chernobyl will soon suffer the effects of radiation exposure after digging trenches in the nuclear zone, the head of the State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management said Wednesday. Yevhen Kramarenko told reporters that Russian troops, who occupied the Chernobyl exclusion zone for five weeks, had dug trenches and shelters for their vehicles in an area known as Red Forest. The Red Forest is a 1.5-square-mile pine forest that died as a result of radiation exposure shortly after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986. It remains the most contaminated part of the exclusion zone, according to Reuters. ""We believe very soon [the Russians] will feel the consequences of radiation that they have received. Some of them will feel it in months, some of them in years,"" Kramarenko said at a press conference Wednesday. ""But anyway, all of the servicemen who were there will feel it at some point,"" He also confirmed earlier reports of Russian soldiers driving around the Red Forest without any protective gear and inhaling clouds of radioactive dust. Radiation poisoning can cause different effects depending on the strength and length of exposure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In more extreme cases, radiation poisoning can lead to internal bleeding and skin burns, as well as thyroid cancer and cardiovascular disease, per the CDC. Russian troops left the exclusion zone at the beginning of the month after some of their soldiers ""panicked"" at the first sign of radiation illness, Ukraine's state power company, Energoatom, said, according to The Guardian. It is unclear exactly what their supposed symptoms were, although they ""showed up very quickly,"" Energoatom added. The Russian troops have since gone to Belarus and Russia, Kramarenko said, adding that Ukrainian plant officials are now working on developing additional safety measures to ""avoid in the future any events similar to what we had to happen."" The power plant was fully decommissioned after the 1986 nuclear accident and the remaining work at the site is mostly directed toward decontamination. Kramarenko said it is unclear how high radiation levels are around the site at the moment because there is currently no electricity. ""Until then we won't understand the damage done,"" he said.

4/14/2022,"McConnell worried that angering Trump ahead of the Georgia Senate runoffs could cost his party the Senate. He privately told Republicans to ""stay focused on Georgia"" even as Trump claimed he could overturn the presidential election. ""I've been calling folks in those states and they're with us,"" Trump boasted to senators in a December 2020 call. Even as then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell avoided discussing his concerns about former President Donald Trump's baseless claims about the 2020 presidential election being stolen or fraudulent, he privately worried that Trump would cost their party control of the Senate by derailing two Georgia Republicans' run-off campaigns. That's according to new details from ""This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America's Future,""a forthcoming book from New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns, that were reported by CNN on Wednesday. Trump reportedly told McConnell and other Republican senators in a December 2020 call that he'd personally been told by state officials in Pennsylvania and Michigan that they would take steps to keep him in power. ""I've been calling folks in those states and they're with us,"" Trump told the senators on the call, per Martin and Burns. He also reportedly believed that if he could pressure Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to de-certify President Joe Biden's election victory in Georgia, then other states would follow suit in a ""domino effect."" That would've flipped Biden's 306-232 electoral college victory to a 284-254 victory for Trump, keeping him in the White House for a second term. But McConnell was far more focused on the upcoming January 5 runoff elections in Georgia, where Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler faced close races with Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, respectively. On the call, Burns and Martin report that Trump also claimed that Georgia voters wouldn't tolerate Kemp's assurances about the security of the election, and that Perdue and Loeffler should speak up lest they lose their races. That contention was reportedly met with silence from McConnell. ""We've got to stay focused on Georgia,"" McConnell told his colleagues right after the December 2020 call with Trump, according to Martin and Burns. Ultimately, Ossoff and Warnock prevailed in an upset that many attributed to depressed Republican turnout due to Trump's false claims about the 2020 election. The book also reported that McConnell sought to maintain a ""strategic silence"" about Trump's false claims in order to prevent him from sabotaging the party's chances in the runoffs. ""What it looks to me like he's doing is setting this up so he can blame the governor and the secretary of state if we lose,"" McConnell told the book's authors ahead of the 2021 runoffs. ""He's always setting up somebody to blame it on."" A McConnell spokesman declined to comment to CNN, while Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich told the outlet that the former president ""has been clear and consistent about the indisputable evidence of fraud in the 2020 presidential election and the need to hold those criminals accountable."" Trump and McConnell haven't spoken since December 15, 2020, when the Republican leader went to the floor of the Senate and declared that ""the Electoral College has spoken."" Trump has since criticized McConnell in blistering terms while calling for him to be overthrown as the Senate Republican leader.

4/14/2022,"A woman who was duct-taped to her seat on an American Airlines flight to Charlotte in July has been fined $81,950 by the Federal Aviation Administration — the administration’s largest fine to date. The woman was flying from Dallas-Fort Worth to Charlotte on an overnight flight that landed in Charotte on July 7. According to the FAA, the woman threatened to hurt a flight attendant after falling into the aisle. The passenger then pushed the flight attendant aside and tried to open the cabin door. More info: CLT flight attendants describe anxiety amid 2021’s unruly passengers The FAA announced the latest round of fines for unruly passengers Friday. Two flight attendants tried to restrain the passenger, but the woman repeatedly hit one flight attendant on the head, according to the FAA. She also bit and tried to kick the crew, according to the FAA. A video posted to TikTok at the time, that has since been removed, showed the woman in visible distress, restrained to her seat as passengers left the plane at the Charlotte airport. The woman was transported to a hospital for evaluation after the flight landed safely at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, American Airlines said at the time. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police was also present at the landing, according to the airline. Reports of unruly passengers on planes jumped dramatically in 2021, often centering around alcohol consumption or mask complaints, according to the FAA. Last year, the FAA initiated a record-high 1,099 investigations into unruly passenger reports, compared to 183 in 2020 and 146 in 2019. So far this year, the FAA has initiated 309 investigations into unruly passenger reports. Unruly passengers have always been part of the job for flight attendants. But it’s gotten much worse, CLT-based flight attendants told the Observer last year. In fact, the Federal Air Marshal Service teaches a self-defense class for airplane crew members once a month at the agency’s Charlotte field office. “Our entire job is preparing for the worst-case scenario,”American Airlines flight attendant Courtney McDonald told the Observer in August 2021, as McDonald and other flight attendants learned self-defense strategies.",U.S./Charlotte Observer,"Unruly woman on American flight to Charlotte duct-taped to seat, hit with largest FAA fine",https://news.yahoo.com/unruly-woman-american-flight-charlotte-154941548.html
