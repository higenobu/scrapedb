4/19/2022,"TULSA, Okla. (AP) — An Oklahoma man who shot two Tulsa police officers, killing one and seriously wounding the other, was in fear for his life after the officers beat, kicked, pepper sprayed and shot him with a stun gun after a traffic stop, his attorney told jurors during opening statements Monday. David Anthony Ware, 34, faces a possible death sentence for killing Sgt. Craig Johnson. He's also charged with wounding a second officer, Aurash Zarkeshan, following a traffic stop on June 29, 2020, along with drug and other charges. “The truth is that when David Ware shot Officer Zarkeshan and Sgt. Johnson, he was in fear for his life,"" Ware's attorney Kevin Adams said. “Sgt. Johnson and Officer Zarkeshan beat David Ware, they kicked David Ware, they tased David Ware, they maced David Ware as he pleaded and begged for somebody to help him. “And when it got to the point that he felt that he was about to lose his life, he shot Officer Zarkashan and he shot Sgt. Craig Johnson."" Prosecutors say Ware, who is white, escalated the situation following the traffic stop by refusing to obey the commands of officers as they sought to get him out of the vehicle. “(Zarkeshan) asked him to step out of the car. This is where things start to get ugly,"" said Assistant District Attorney Kevin Gray. “The traffic stop started out OK. It went really bad."" Gray said Zarkeshan pulled Ware over about 3 a.m. after he saw him run a stop sign and then take a wide turn into another lane of traffic. Ware failed to produce a driver's license or proof of insurance when Zarkeshan asked him to provide those documents. A nine-man, three-woman jury, along with several alternate jurors, were selected last week. Co-defendant Matthew Hall, who authorities said drove Ware from the scene after the shooting, is serving a 24-year prison sentence after being convicted on two counts of being an accessory to a felony in the case.",U.S./Associated Press,Attorney: Man who shot Oklahoma officers feared for his life,https://news.yahoo.com/attorney-man-shot-oklahoma-officers-173849073.html

4/19/2022,"By Zohra Bensemra and Joseph Campbell (Reuters) - Ukrainian investigators have examined 269 dead bodies in Irpin, near Kyiv, since the town was taken back from Russian forces in late March, a police official said on Monday, as workers dug fresh graves on its outskirts. The town, which had a pre-war population of about 62,000, was one of the main hotspots of fighting with Russian troops before they pulled back from Ukraine's northern regions to intensify their offensive in the east. At a cemetery on the outskirts of Irpin, dozens of new graves have been dug and heaped with wreaths. Under the watch of a few tearful mourners, workers hurriedly shovelled the sandy earth into one grave on Monday. ""As of now, we have inspected 269 dead bodies,"" said Serhiy Panteleyev, first deputy head of the police's main investigation department, at an online briefing. He said forensic work was ongoing to determine the cause of death for many of the victims, sharing photos of severely charred human remains. He said seven sites in Irpin where civilians were allegedly shot have been inspected, without giving further details. Russia denies targeting civilians and has dismissed allegations its troops committed war crimes in occupied areas of Ukraine.
