3/20/2022,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) erupted at a reporter on Friday who questioned her on her apparent support for Russian President Vladimir Putin and her attacks on Ukraine. “You can just stop,” she snapped at Axios reporter Andrew Solender when he asked if her comments and actions “represent a sympathy for Russia and the Kremlin” in its invasion of Ukraine. “I don’t have any sympathy for Putin and Russia,” Greene insisted. “So you can take your pro-Putin garbage and can take it somewhere else.” She also called the Russian leader “murderous.” But just last month, Greene was a key speaker at a white nationalist conference where Russia was given a post-invasion “round of applause” and the audience chanted Putin’s name. She has also attacked “neo-Nazis” in Ukraine, parroting Putin’s broad characterization of the country in a vain attempt to justify his invasion. Hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy implored U.S. Congress on Wednesday for more help battling Russia’s devastating invasion, Greene indicated in a video on Facebook that “both sides” were responsible for Russia’s military assault on a sovereign nation. She also challenged Ukraine’s legitimacy, claiming on Facebook that Ukraine’s 2014 revolution was a U.S.-backed coup and that its current government “only exists because the Obama State Department helped to overthrow the previous regime.” Greene was one of only eight Republicans in the House on Thursday to vote (in a 424-8 tally) against legislation to revoke normal trade relations with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Last week, Greene called decorated military veteran and former National Security Council official Alexander Vindman a “clown” on Twitter for criticizing comments she had made about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Vindman accused her and what he called the “pro-Putin” Republican Party of essentially handing the Russian president permission to invade Ukraine with their “cheerleading.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/20/2022,"Disney can’t seem to get it right. The company’s Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, apologized Friday after a performance from a Texas high school’s drill team was laden with Native American stereotypes, including repeated chants of “scalp them!” It came just days after the company faced intense backlash over its silence to Florida’s controversial sex education bill, labeled by many critics as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. The company told the Associated Press the performance, done by Port Neches-Grove High School’s “Indianettes” drill team on Tuesday, “did not reflect our core values, and we regret it took place.” It claimed the performance did not match the audition tape sent by the school to the park’s organizers. “We have immediately put measures in place so this is not repeated,” Disney spokesperson Jacquee Wahler said. The video was shared by Tara Houska, a tribal attorney and the founder of “Not Your Mascots,” a group dedicated to reducing stereotypical depictions of Native Americans. The school’s website—which features a Native American in a headdress as its mascot—said the Indianettes have been a tradition for half a century. The school district released a statement Friday saying it was aware of the backlash to the performance, though it claimed the routine had been performed at Disney for years and no issues has previously been raised. Still, it pledged to focus more on diversity. “We are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in our school district,” it said in a statement. “Our district is nearing 100 years old, and our Board of Trustees is committed to always making the best decisions for our students, staff, and the communities of Port Neches and Groves.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/20/2022,"The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday to suspend normal trade relations with Russia and its ally Belarus in response to Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine, opening the door for large tariff increases on imports of key commodities and raw materials. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the Senate will soon take up the bill, setting the stage for President Biden to sign in into law as soon as next week. “While it has been clear all week that the House would quickly approve this bill, as of yesterday the inherently political decision to put this bill on the Senate floor had not been made, so this announcement from Schumer represents a material escalation of the sanctions investors can anticipate from the President of the United States in the coming days,” wrote Henrietta Treyz, director of economic policy at Veda Partners in a Thursday note to clients.",Politics/Barrons.com,Here Are the U.S. Top 10 Imports From Russia as Tariffs Are Set to Rise,https://news.yahoo.com/m/70ad8cc4-138d-34f5-8838-f0aaa62df824/here-are-the-u-s-top-10.html
3/20/2022,"KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Russia said its forces were ""tightening the noose"" around the besieged Ukrainian port of Mariupol on Friday and concern grew over mass civilian casualties as the United States again warned China against aiding Moscow in its invasion. Russia's advance in Ukraine has largely stalled, and its troops, frustrated by fierce Ukrainian resistance, have blasted residential areas to rubble. On Friday, missiles landed near Lviv, a western city where thousands have fled for refuge. In Mariupol, the scene of heavy bombardment, officials estimated 80% of the city's homes had been damaged and that 1,000 people may still be trapped in makeshift bomb shelters beneath a destroyed theatre. Nearly 5,000 Ukrainians were evacuated from Mariupol on Friday, officials said, and residents reported seeing dead bodies along the roadside as they fled the city. ""We were careful and didn't want the children to see the bodies, so we tried to shield their eyes,"" said Nick Osychenko, the CEO of a Mariupol TV station who fled the city with six members of his family. ""We were nervous the whole journey. It was frightening, just frightening."" Ukraine said it had rescued 130 people from the basement of a Mariupol theatre that was flattened by Russian strikes two days ago. Russia denied hitting the theatre and says it does not target civilians. China is the one big power that has yet to condemn Russia's assault, and Washington fears Beijing may be considering giving Moscow financial and military support, something that both Russia and China deny. In a video call that lasted around two hours, U.S. President Joe Biden warned China's President Xi Jinping on Friday of ""implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia"" in Ukraine, the White House said. The White House later said that sanctioning Beijing, the world's largest exporter, was an option, though it did not detail what constituted material support. Chinese state media quoted Xi as saying: ""The Ukraine crisis is something that we don't want to see,"" adding that the call was requested by the U.S. side. NATO should hold talks with Russia to resolve the factors behind the conflict, Chinese state media quoted Xi as saying, without assigning blame to Russia for the invasion. 'STARVATION' The mayor of Mariupol confirmed to the BBC that fighting had reached the centre of the city, where some 400,000 people have been trapped for over two weeks, sheltering from bombardment that has cut electricity, heating and water supply. Regional Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said around 35,000 people had managed to leave the city in recent days, many on foot or in convoys of private cars, but near-constant shelling was preventing humanitarian aid from getting in. Oksana Zalavska, 42, fled Mariupol two days ago after staying in an overcrowded bomb shelter where adults ate one tiny meal a day as rations were low. ""Now I know everything about starvation in 2022,"" she said. French President Emmanuel Macron told Putin he was extremely concerned about the situation in Mariupol while the Kremlin said it was doing everything possible to protect civilians. Jakob Kern, emergency coordinator for the crisis at the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP), said Ukraine's ""food supply chain is falling apart"" with insecurity and fear of attack hindering the movement of goods. WFP buys nearly half of its wheat from Ukraine to feed people in global crisis zones, and Kern said the war could cause ""collateral hunger"" in poor countries worldwide. PUTIN RALLY At the start of the fourth week of Putin's attempt to subdue what he calls an artificial state undeserving of nationhood, Ukraine's elected government is still standing and Russian forces have not captured a single big city. With Russia looking to regain the initiative, three missiles landed at an airport near Lviv, a western city where hundreds of thousands thought they had found refuge far from Ukraine's battlefields. Putin promised tens of thousands of people waving Russian flags at a soccer stadium in Moscow that the ""special operation"" would succeed. ""We know what we need to do, how to do it and at what cost. And we will absolutely accomplish all of our plans,"" Putin said, adding that, when needed, Russian soldiers ""shield each other from bullets with their bodies like brothers"". Russian troops have taken heavy losses while assaulting urban areas, sending more than 3 million refugees fleeing over Ukraine's western border. Ukraine said its troops had prevented Russia from making any fresh advances on Friday and the Russians had problems with food, fuel and communications. Britain said Russian forces had made minimal progress this week. Russia has been intensively shelling eastern Ukrainian cities, especially Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol, and there have been nightly deadly missile attacks on Kyiv, where Ukrainian forces have halted troop columns outside the city. Debris from a missile blew a large crater in the ground in the middle of a residential block where a school was also located in northern Kyiv, shattering hundreds of windows and leaving debris scattered around the complex. At least one person was killed, emergency services said. Kyiv's mayor said 19 people were injured including four children. ""This is a war crime by Putin,"" said Lyudmila Nikolaenko, visiting her son, who lived in one of the apartments hit. ""They say they aren't hitting regular people, they say we are firing at ourselves."" Kyiv and Moscow reported progress in talks this week towards a political formula that would guarantee Ukraine security protection outside of the NATO alliance. But Ukraine said the need for an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian troops remained unchanged, and both sides accused each other on Friday of dragging out the talks.
