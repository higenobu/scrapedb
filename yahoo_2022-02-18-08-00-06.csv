2/18/2022,"©Juan Carlos Vindas/Getty Images A small bird of prey native to Mexico and Central America is making headlines after its apparent decision to spend the winter in Texas. The now-famous bat falcon was spotted for the first time at the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge in Alamo around Thanksgiving. According to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), this is the first recorded time that a bat falcon has ever been seen in the U.S. Based on the bird's ""buff-cinnamon throat and crest bars,"" officials determined that it was a juvenile, while ""the thickness of the tarsus and beak"" indicate that it's a male. Peter Witt told KSAT that he and his wife visited the refuge on the Mexico border specifically to see the bird. ""We could see him fly off from a tree shag perch, skim the lake, grab an insect and return to chow down, then rest a bit and repeat. We watched him for about 20 minutes... a wonderful and unique experience,"" he told the local news station. USFWS shared Witt's photos of the bird on its Facebook page this week. WATCH: Rare Snowy Owl Appears in Washington Joe Barnett, USFWS deputy refuge manager for the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge, told Border Report that about 4,000 birders have come to the refuge since the bat falcon was first spotted. ""Somebody even came from Europe, so it's drawing a lot of attention. People coming just to see this bird,"" Barnett said.

2/18/2022,"The World Health Organization has released a new report on Omicron sub-variant BA.2 which shows the strain accounted for 21.5% of all new Omicron cases analyzed worldwide in the first week of February. Omicron, in turn, represented nearly all of the variants identified globally (98.3%) in the genomically-sequenced samples submitted to the GISAID data-sharing hub in the previous 30 days. Translation: BA.2 is spreading rapidly, though it is unclear to what effect.

Those include Denmark, India, China, Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, Guam, Montenegro, Nepal, Pakistan and the Philippines. The report notes, however, that there are massive differences
in its spread across the globe “with the South-East Asia Region reporting the highest prevalence of BA.2 among Omicron sequences (44.7%) and the Region of the Americas reporting the lowest prevalence (1%).” That’s good news for the U.S., most of which is removing restrictions after the winter Omicron wave. The prevalence of BA.2 has tripled from 1.2% during the week ending 29 January 2022 to 3.6% during the week ending 5 February 2022, but it still makes up a very small proportion of new cases. By contrast, the new Omicron strain’s prevalence in South Africa rose from 27% on February 4 to 86% by February 11. In the United Kingdom it jumped six-fold from January 17-31, from 2.2% to 12%. Denmark saw its BA.2 numbers double from the last week of 2021 to mid-January 2022, from 20% to 45%. It became the dominant variant in that country by the third week of January, at 66% of sequenced samples. Emma B. Hodcroft, https://covariants.org/ A late-January report from the Statens Serum Institut, which operates under the auspices of the Dutch Ministry of Health, found that BA.2 will likely account for “nearly 100% of all cases by mid-February 2022.” The report also found that “BA.2 may be approx. 30% more transmissible than BA.1 (the original Omicron). “Consequently,” the assessment continues, “this quick increase in BA.2 may lead to a steeper epidemic curve with a higher peak and may postpone the time at which infection rates decline until February.” The WHO, which was among the first prominent bodies to raise concern over the new strain, created a chart outlining its current thinking about BA.2, which indicates its real departure from other variants is, indeed, in transmissibility. WHO The reasons for the differences in rates of spread among countries are unclear. “The difference in growth potential between countries may be linked to differences in vaccination coverage and contact patterns arising because of restrictions, population densities, etc.,” the WHO report suggests. But an analysis of those factors does not provide clarity. Denmark recently dropped nearly all of its restrictions, but its citizens are highly vaccinated, at over 80% according to Johns Hopkins University. By comparison, 65% percent of U.S. citizens are vaccinated. Yet we have not experienced the kind of growth that Denmark has, although we are only now broadly lifting masking restrictions. Meanwhile South Africa, where Omicron was first identified and where BA.2 is now dominant, has just 29% of its population fully vaccinated, but still requires masks in indoor public places. As for population density, Denmark overall is far more concentrated than either South Africa or the United States — which, of course, does have highly dense urban centers. One thing that is clear: Cases are down in all three countries, despite the growth of BA.2. Also on the way down, however, is the number of tests, which muddies the analysis. Test positivity in all three countries is also a mixed bag, with Denmark moving up to at 35% the last week of January, the U.S. falling to 8.7% today and South Africa trending down to 11.3% in the first week of February.

2/18/2022,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (AP) — A U.S. Coast Guard vessel on Thursday offloaded more than 30 metric tons of cocaine and marijuana reportedly worth over $1 billion that was seized at sea during a months-long deployment off the coast of South America. The haul of illegal narcotics brought home by the U.S. Coast Guard cutter James was one of the biggest in recent memory, a reflection of increasingly sophisticated U.S. arsenal that includes powerful drones and special infrared cameras that can detect heat from small cocaine-laden vessels. But it also highlights a recent surge in narcotics coming from Colombia, a close U.S. ally and the world's top producer of cocaine. The Biden administration's top anti-narcotics officials traveled to South Florida to welcome back the vessel's crew and tout the Coast Guard's role interdicting drugs before they reach American streets. “We are hitting the drug traffickers where it hits them most: their pocketbooks,” said Dr. Rahul Gupta, head of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy. Gupta said the Biden administration is seeking to increase the U.S. government’s budget to build up the nation’s addiction treatment infrastructure and reduce the supply of synthetic opioids like fentanyl and other drugs. But the record busts of late by the Coast Guard, federal law enforcement and partner nations also underscores how little the flow of cocaine coming from Latin America has eased since President Richard Nixon declared war on drugs a half century ago. Coca cultivation in Colombia in 2020 soared to 245000 hectares (945 square miles), enough to produce 1,010 metric tons of cocaine, according to the White House's latest report on harvesting trends in the Andean region. As recently as 2014, potential production was less than half that amount. Production in Peru and Bolivia has also steadily risen. Admiral Karl Schultz, the U.S. Coast Guard commander, said those numbers would be even higher, and the destabilizing impact on the region from transnational criminal organizations even worse, if not for the U.S. interdiction efforts. “Does it matter? It absolutely matters because it kind of keeps a lid on things,” he said. He was echoed by Ambassador Todd Robinson, who leads the State Department's bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. “It's not just always about seizures,” said Robinson, who previously served as the U.S.' top diplomat in Guatemala and Venezuela, two major transit zones for Colombian cocaine. “It's also about building our partners' capacity.”",U.S./Associated Press,U.S. Coast Guard offloads $1 billion worth of narcotics,https://news.yahoo.com/u-coast-guard-offloads-1-210603507.html
2/18/2022,"Donald Trump said in court Monday that he doesn't know anything about the Trump Organization's finances. In a Tuesday statement, he said the company ""has among the best real estate and other assets"" in the world. The New York attorney general's office pointed out the discrepancy ahead of a hearing Thursday. Former President Donald Trump said in a court filing Monday that he ""denies knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth"" about his company's finances. A day later, he issued a blistering 1,100-word statement in response to his longtime accounting firm Mazars USA dropping the Trump Organization as a client and claiming it could no longer stand by a decade's worth of tax documents. Trump waxed lyrical about his company's ""fantastic assets"" and said prosecutors should consider giving Hillary Clinton the death penalty instead of investigating the Trump Organization's finances. ""My company has among the best real estate and other assets anywhere in the world, has significant amounts of cash, and has relatively very little debt, which is totally current,"" Trump said in the statement Tuesday. The discrepancy was pointed out in a court filing Wednesday from the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James. Her office is set to face off against Trump in court Thursday and ask a judge to enforce a subpoena that would force him to sit for a deposition. ""It is not unusual for parties to a legal proceeding to disagree about the facts,"" wrote Austin Thompson, a lawyer for James's office. ""But it is truly rare for a party to publicly disagree with statements submitted by his own attorneys in a signed pleading — let alone one day after the pleading was filed. That is what Mr. Trump has done here."" Since 2019, James has been overseeing an investigation into whether the Trump Organization broke financial laws by keeping two sets of books for property valuations in order to receive generous tax, loan, and insurance rates. James's office is working alongside the Manhattan district attorney's office on a parallel criminal investigation into the Trump Organization. In order to try to enforce the subpoena, James filed more than 100 pages of documents last month revealing new depths of the Trump Organization's finances. They outlined numerous ""fraudulent or misleading"" business practices. On Monday, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, both of whom James is also seeking to depose, filed arguments to try to block a subpoena as well. They similarly argued they did not have ""knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth"" regarding the attorney general's claims about the company's finances. Thompson said the claims were nonsense. ""It is not plausible that neither Mr. Trump, nor Donald Trump, Jr., has sufficient knowledge to form a belief as to Mr. Trump's relationship with the Trump Organization, the key entities that hold its assets, or the Revocable Trust,"" he wrote. ""Such denials of information can and should be treated as admissions.""

2/18/2022,"Two people are facing criminal charges after police in Vermont say they left their child alone in a freezing car to go skiing. The Killington Police Department says it received reports of the unattended child on Tuesday, Feb. 8, at the Killington Resort, which describes itself as a “four-season destination on 3,000 acres in the heart of Vermont’s Green Mountains.” The car where the 2-year-old child was left was turned off and Killington Police told McClatchy News it was approximately 28 degrees that day. Police say they later spotted the parents’ car on a nearby road and stopped them to investigate. The pair were eventually charged with cruelty to a child, according to a news release. Police say the driver looked like she was under the influence of alcohol and was also charged with a DUI. After further investigation, police say both were found to be employees of the Killington Resort. Both accessed the loading lift gates 10 times during that day, police say. The Killington Resort did not immediately respond to a request for comment from McClatchy News. “They both ultimately admitted their involvement in leaving their child alone in their vehicle while skiing,” police said. “(They) advised they checked on the child immediately after each ‘run’.” Police say both the Vermont Department of Children and Families and the New York State Department of Child Protective Services have been made aware of the situation. The parents are scheduled to appear in court at a later unspecified date, according to police. Earlier this year, a 4-year-old girl had spent about seven hours in a daycare van in Rochester, New York, after a daycare driver left her there “due to a lack of protocol,” as previously reported by McClatchy News. The girl, Makyia Artis, was only discovered after fellow children at the center were put in the vehicle to go home at the end of Jan. 7, Sara Dunbar, owner of Living Waters Childcare, told McClatchy News. She added that two daycare workers were immediately fired. The child’s grandmother, Brenda Powell, told WROC that Makyia was in the van for hours and that it was snowing all day. “The bus seats are leather, and windows had to have been covered in snow, where she couldn’t even see out because it snowed all day long. So she just slept balled up in a ball on a cold leather seat for nine hours,” Powell told the outlet.

2/18/2022,"A Republican member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus who had advanced knowledge of former President Donald Trump’s Jan. 6 plans reportedly sent an alarming message to the White House in the days before the attack on the U.S. Capitol. “If POTUS allows this to occur… we’re driving a stake in the heart of the federal republic,” the unnamed lawmaker wrote to then-chief of staff Mark Meadows on Jan. 1 or Jan. 2, according to The Washington Post. On Wednesday, Post reporter Carol Leonnig said on MSNBC that the “particularly foreboding” message raises serious questions. “What exactly did that Freedom Caucus member mean by ‘this’?” she asked in comments highlighted by Raw Story. Leonnig said that it was possible the lawmaker was referring to the pressure on then-Vice President Mike Pence to block the certification of the 2020 election in Congress (which he ultimately refused to do). “But what else could the ‘this’ be?” she asked. “How grim and chilling a piece of information is this, if this lawmaker knew something Donald Trump was plotting beyond what we all know now?” See more in the clip posted by Raw Story: Jaqueline Alemany, lead author of The Washington Post story on the text messages, also discussed the findings with MSNBC’s Alex Wagner: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.",Politics/HuffPost,Journalist Reveals 'Chilling' Text GOP Lawmaker Sent White House Before Jan. 6 Riot,https://news.yahoo.com/journalist-reveals-chilling-text-gop-093513963.html
