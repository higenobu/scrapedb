1/28/2022,"When Festy Ebosele rejected the opportunity to sign for Nottingham Forest last week, Derby County supporters probably thought they couldn’t love the youngster more. The right-sided teenage speedster was the subject of a £500,000 bid from the Rams’ most bitter rivals but is widely reported to have baulked at the notion of further demoralising a fanbase already in despair at the prospect of not having anything to support unless a buyer for what’s left of their club after years of financial mismanagement can be found in the not-too-distant future. While Derby could certainly do with £500,000, Ebosele’s tender years mean whoever signs him next may have to pay a good deal more in compensation. Little victories are important and it’s a big win for the Rams that he chose not to move down the road.  What with points deductions, administration and being eight points adrift of safety, it’s been a bleak old year for Derby fans, so much so that one of few current silver linings in the massive black cloud hovering over Pride Park is the prospect of a potential rescue by former Newcastle owner Mike Ashley. Mike Ashley! But on Wednesday night, for an hour or so, Ebosele rode to the rescue once again. Contacted by one supporter who had hoped to get an autograph for young daughter Bella from her favourite player, the Irishman travelled to Mansfield to surprise her at football training, chat to her at length, present her with a shirt and pose for pictures along with his dog. A pooch, incidentally, The Fiver couldn’t help but notice bears a passing resemblance to something you might more usually see perched on BoJo-loyalist and Tory MP Michael Fabricant’s head. “This is why Derby have to survive,” wrote Bella’s dad Dave. “This guy is only 19 but he is the kindest person and made Bella feel like a million dollars.” In need of a buyer willing to spend up to a hundred times that amount – the thick end of £70m – to save a football club that doesn’t own a stadium (and potentially ruinous legal claims from Middlesbrough and Wycombe should they go to court), Derby could have gone to the wall next week. But earlier on Thursday, they learned they have been given a deadline extension of one month to show they can stay afloat financially for the rest of the season. “Today’s development will allow the club to meet its ongoing obligations whilst giving a further four weeks to continue the discussions with the interested bidders and relevant stakeholders in respect of a sale,” droned a statement from their administrators and the Football League. The extra month will give Derby time to address the £29m they owe in taxes and it has been reported they have had positive talks with Her Majesty’s bean-counters over an agreement to pay significantly less than that amount. With the Inland Revenue not generally renowned for their charity and mercy, The Fiver can only conclude that Wayne Rooney must have sent Ebosele to have a quiet word. “I pay tribute to all those that have worked so hard to get to this point” – Sunderland Central MP, Julie Elliott, after it was revealed that professional female footballers in England are to finally benefit from maternity and long-term sickness cover, in a landmark change to their contracts. “Has The Fiver and Big Website not received the memo that this is the Africa Cup of Nations 2021 and not 2022?

1/28/2022,"The national pig herd has lost-one tenth of all sows over the last six months, farmers’ associations have revealed, after breeders were forced into a massive cull caused by a shortage of labour in abattoirs. The National Farmers’ Union president, Minette Batters, and the National Pig Association chairman, Rob Mutimer, have written a joint letter to the environment, food and rural affairs secretary, George Eustice, calling for an urgent summit to address labour and supply-chain concerns.  They say measures introduced to support the industry have so far delivered “minimal benefit” to pig producers. The call comes as the cull of healthy pigs on farms continues, with an estimated 35,000 animals killed since September, according to the NPA, although unreported cases mean the actual number is likely to be higher. Since the crisis hit last year, some 30,000 sows have been removed from the national herd, they said. Some 40 independent farms have left the industry, the associations claimed. The letter states: “The NPA and NFU are asking that you urgently arrange a summit of the entire pig supply chain so that we can agree a plan to get these pigs off farms and on to people’s plates.” In October, following weeks of warnings of the impact of an ongoing shortage of workers at slaughterhouses, farmers were forced to start killing animals to make space and ensure the continued welfare of their livestock. Producers warned at the time there was a backlog of as many as 120,000 pigs left stranded on farms long after they should have gone to slaughter. Before Christmas, the backlog had risen to 170,000. Farmers say it continued to increase rapidly over the festive period due to staff taking holidays and isolating with Covid. The industry said the situation has deteriorated despite the government’s package of support measures announced in the autumn. These included permitting foreign butchers to enter the UK on temporary visas, longer working hours at processing plants and a scheme allowing producers to store pig carcasses for several months before processing. The organisations are calling on Eustice to simplify the visa application process. The NPA said it is only aware of 105 butchers who have travelled to Britain or are due to arrive, representing just 13% of the 800 visas allocated by government. The NPA warns that not enough pigs are being processed, with around a third of pigs ready for slaughter not being taken each week. This results in an increased backlog of animals on farms, while those which are left behind are becoming heavier and more difficult to manage. Average weights of pig carcasses have continued to rise, reaching over 95kg, an increase of almost 10%, or 9kg, compared with two years ago. Farmers are facing soaring costs for feed, leading to losses of around £25 per pig for almost a year. Some producers are removing breeding sows from their herds, while others are leaving the sector altogether. “All of these factors are taking a huge toll on farmers’ mental health as the crisis worsens every week,” the letter to Eustice states, “especially for those having to endure the trauma of culling healthy animals when there seems to be no end in sight.”",News/Business,British farmers call for summit on worsening pig-cull crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/27/british-farmers-call-for-summit-on-worsening-pig-cull-crisis
1/28/2022,"Two-time Super Bowl champion Ben Roethlisberger has announced his retirement from the NFL.

A message from Ben:@steelers #NFL #SteelersNation #ThankYou#HereWeGo #LoveAndHonor pic.twitter.com/pUbKGO1nUs “The journey has been exhilarating, fueled by a spirit of competition,” Roethlisberger said. “Yet the time has come to clean out my locker, hang up my cleats and continue to be all I can be to my wife and children.

At 6ft 5in and 240lbs, Roethlisberger was tough to bring down for opposing rushers, and he was often able to extend plays until he could find open receivers with his powerful arm.

1/28/2022,"Surprise that Tommy Fleetwood has slipped to 43rd in the world – and the fifth-ranked Englishman – owes everything to appreciation of his talent. Before the pandemic, Fleetwood was inside the top 10 and looked a certainty to claim at least one major championship. Instead there has been a winless run that now stretches back to late 2019. An opening round of 67 at the Dubai Desert Classic suggested Fleetwood is of a mind to return to earlier prominence. There has not quite been cause to ponder where it all went wrong, but day one at the Emirates Club supplied a reminder of what an impressive sight Fleetwood in full flow can be. He dropped just one shot, at the 13th, but easily offset it with six birdies.  “I’m very focused on my overall game,” Fleetwood said. “Obviously there are two aspects I need to improve. I need to be in the fairway a lot more with a driver and I need to be putting better. “For the most part – I’m not going to speak too soon – but I feel like if I do put it in the fairway, that is giving me the best chance to score and I feel like I’m hitting my irons really nicely. I did two things well for the most part and I holed some nice putts and no matter what golf course I go to, that’s going to be my main focus for the foreseeable future. To get back to doing the things that I always did do so well and taking it from there.” Simple in theory, of course, but Fleetwood is thus far delivering inside the ropes. A strong putting display from Joachim B Hansen allowed him to claim the early lead, at seven under par. On a tightly-packed leaderboard Justin Harding – who must return on Friday morning to complete his first round after darkness fell – trails Hansen by one. Pablo Larrazábal, Sergio García, Andrea Pavan and Thongchai Jaidee joined Fleetwood in posting 67s. Collin Morikawa, the Open champion, and Viktor Hovland are a shot further back. Morikawa had been seven under with four to play but from there dropped three shots. “It was a disappointing finish but I’ve been working Monday through Wednesday, even into yesterday late after the Pro-Am trying to figure things out,” Morikawa said. “When you are thinking about so much you always have to remember to go and play golf. I’ve been thinking about everything, trying to figure out what to do.” Handily for Morikawa, it is only January. Rory McIlroy’s day also started brightly. The Northern Irishman was three under through five but eventually had to settle for a 71. His game appears a work in progress and he said: “There were a couple of bad decisions or mental mistakes and then maybe made a couple of bad swings in there as well.”",Sport/Sport,Fleetwood’s opening 67 at Dubai Desert Classic hints at return to top form,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/27/golf-dubai-desert-classic-tommy-fleetwood-joachim-hansen-sergio-garcia
1/28/2022,"The Kalevala, the Finnish epic poem describing the creation of the world and the journeys and adventures of the people of the land of Kalevala, first appeared in print in 1835; an expanded version, almost twice as long, followed 14 years later. Its appearance proved hugely significant in the development of Finland’s national identity and the country’s progress towards independence (which was eventually achieved in 1917), and its influence on 19th- and 20th-century Finnish artists was immense. For Sibelius the Kalevala was famously a lifelong source of inspiration, from his earliest large-scale work, Kullervo, to his last, the symphonic poem Tapiola. But he was by no means the only composer to write works based on the epic and the stories it contains, and three of those pieces are brought together in this collection from the Lahti orchestra under their former music director, Dima Slobodaniouk. Inevitably it includes some Sibelius too: the first recording of the 1897 version of Lemminkäinen in Tuonela, fractionally longer than what we know as the third movement of his Lemminkäinen Suite.  The other composers represented belong to the generations that followed in Sibelius’s intimidating footsteps. It’s revealing that their Kalevala works all date from relatively early in their careers, as if a coming-to-terms musically with their country’s most significant work of literature was a necessary rite of passage for them all. Leevi Madetoja‘s Kullervo dates from 1913, but though Madetoja had been a pupil of Sibelius, his compact, 13-minute symphonic poem portraying one of the epic’s “heroes” owes more to Tchaikovsky than it does to his teacher. Tauno Pylkännen’s Kullervo Goes to War, completed in 1942, is much closer to Sibelius, and a taut, powerfully effective piece that surely should be better known outside Finland than it is. Uuno Klami’s Kalevala Suite is much the most ambitious of the three works. It’s the most uneven of them too, but in many ways the most interesting, as the only one that clearly distances itself from the world of Sibelius. Stravinsky, especially The Firebird and The Rite of Spring, is very obviously the dominant influence in the five movements, which portray different episodes in the epic, from The Creation of the World to The Forging of the Sampo (a mysterious, magical device that confers riches and good luck on its owner). Taken together the three works and the Sibelius rarity make a fascinating collection of music that will be totally unfamiliar internationally; if none of them is a neglected masterpiece, all are very well worth hearing, especially in such characterful and accomplished performances as these.",Arts/Music,Scenes from the Kalevala review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/27/scenes-from-the-kalevala-review-klami-sibelius-madetoja-pylkkanen-lahti-so
1/28/2022,"Elderly people living near or downwind from unconventional oil and gas wells such as fracking sites are more likely to die prematurely, according to a major new US study. Extracting oil and gas through newer or unconventional methods like fracking has expanded rapidly across America over the past two decades with at least 17.6 million people now living within one kilometer of an active well.  Compared with traditional drilling, unconventional oil and gas development (UOGD) is linked to higher levels of exposure to toxic air pollution and poor water quality, as well as noise and light pollution which can be harmful to human health. The impact of fossil fuel extraction – including by unconventional methods – has disproportionately affected low income communities and people of color. Researchers from the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health studied the health records of 15 million people on Medicare, the health insurance program that includes at least 95% of Americans aged 65 and older, living in all significant drilling regions from 2001 to 2015. They also gathered data on about 2.5m oil and gas wells covering leading exploration states, from Montana to Texas and Pennsylvania. The closer people live to an oil and gas operation, the higher the risk of dying prematurely, even after accounting for socioeconomic, environmental and demographic factors such as gender and race, according to the study published in Nature Energy. Residents most adversely affected are those living nearby and downwind, suggesting toxic airborne contaminants emitted from UOGD sites probably contributed to higher mortality rates. Exposure to toxins associated with unconventional drilling such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides and radioactive materials are linked to a wide range of life-threatening medical conditions. “Our findings suggest the importance of considering the potential health dangers of situating UOGD near or upwind of people’s homes,” said Longxiang Li, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Environmental Health and the study’s lead author. Overall, elderly residents living near these wells have about 2.5% higher mortality rates than those living far away compared with 3.5% for those who are also downwind. This would mean thousands of premature deaths linked to the oil and gas boom, though the peer-reviewed study does not include estimates of lives lost. This is the first major study into the link between premature death in older people and unconventional oil and gas drilling activities, and the first to examine the importance of wind direction. As of 2015, more than 100,000 onshore UOGD wells have been drilled, with many clustered around densely populated residential areas. “Although UOGD is a major industrial activity in the US, very little is known about its public health impacts. Our study is the first to link mortality to UOGD-related air pollutant exposures,” said Petros Koutrakis, professor of environmental sciences and senior author of the study. It builds on previous studies that have found residents living near these sites are significantly more likely to suffer prenatal complications, cancers and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. As unconventional oil and gas exploration continues apace further research is needed to understand the causal links between living nearby or downwind and adverse health effects, the authors conclude.",News/Environment,"People living closer to US oil and gas wells have higher risk of dying prematurely, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/27/people-living-closer-us-oil-and-gas-wells-higher-risk-dying-prematurely-study
1/28/2022,"Liz Truss has been criticised for taking a private jet to Australia for official business rather than using a scheduled flight. The foreign secretary used the private government Airbus A321 for her flight from London’s Stansted airport to Sydney, via Dubai and Kuala Lumpur, arriving on 20 January.  The foreign secretary held talks with her Australian counterpart and gave a speech on arguing global aggressors are “emboldened in a way we haven’t seen since the cold war”. The Independent, which first reported the transport arrangement, quoted industry sources who put the cost at half a million pounds. One of the daily Qantas flights to Perth and on to Sydney would have been scheduled to get Truss there almost five hours earlier. After two days in Sydney, Truss flew to Adelaide for a speech, using the same plane, on 22 January, then flew home, taking the same refuelling stops, the following day. A small ministerial and staff delegation would be expected to be onboard. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “It’s necessary for the foreign secretary to travel abroad to pursue UK interests around security, trade and technology, as she did during this visit to Australia. “This trip used government transport and was fully within rules set out in the ministerial code.” Truss has long been a champion of eliminating government waste. In 2007 she wrote a paper for the Reform thinktank arguing for public servants to fly economy class. “Every public sector worker should feel personal responsibility for the money they spend and the money they save,” she wrote. “They should spend taxpayers’ money with at least the care they would give to their own. This change of mindset would be reflected in everyday changes such as travelling by economy rather than business class.” The foreign secretary has also previously been criticised for allegedly overruling the civil service to demand more expensive hospitality. She hosted a lunch with Joe Biden’s trade representative at a private club owned by a Tory donor after overruling civil service advice to look for a cheaper venue, according to leaked emails. Angela Rayner, the deputy leader of the Labour party, said: “Liz Truss shows the public exactly quite how little respect this Conservative government has for taxpayers’ money with her ridiculous waste of half a million pounds on a private jet trip. This government is brazen in its disregard for upholding decency. “It is obscene that government ministers are jet-setting yet are hiking taxes and refusing to do anything to help working families when they are feeling the pinch of the cost of living crisis. “Tories waste disgusting amounts of public money on their own vanity and comfort, Labour wants to see families see a cut to energy bills – that is the difference.”",News/Politics,Labour condemns ‘waste’ of Liz Truss taking private jet to Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/27/labour-condemns-waste-of-liz-truss-taking-private-jet-to-australia
1/28/2022,"If you had been forced to predict which blue-chip American rock legend was going to suddenly pull their music off Spotify in protest at the streaming site hosting a far-right-friendly podcast that spreads medical misinformation, Neil Young would have been a very safe bet.  He is famously among the most ornery, uncompromising and capricious of said blue-chip legends. The years that produced his most famous work also played host to Young wilfully sabotaging his own commercial prospects in order to follow his muse (or, as he memorably put it, “heading for the ditch”); suddenly abandoning tours midway by directing his tour bus to pull off the motorway en route to the next show; whimsically declining to release a succession of completed albums; and incurring the wrath of his partners in Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY) by removing their contributions from the master tapes of his songs before releasing them. He spent a substantial chunk of the 1980s making wildly uncommercial albums, apparently with the specific intention of annoying his record label, which ended up suing him for being unpredictable – it lost, perhaps because, as his labelmate Elton John put it, its lawsuit “felt a bit like suing Neil Young for being Neil Young”. He has failed to mellow with age: not for nothing is the news section of his website called the Times-Contrarian; according to Young’s recent post on it, when his lawyers advised him “that contractually I didn’t have the control of my music to [leave Spotify], I announced I was leaving anyway, because I knew I was”, which is pretty much the most Neil Youngian response imaginable. He has a long history of political activism. It was Young who wrote Ohio, CSNY’s response to the Kent State Massacre, arguably the most famous protest song of the early 70s; Young who piloted the 2006 CSNY Freedom of Speech tour, its setlist so packed with Young’s new anti-Bush protest songs that audiences in red states booed and walked out; Young who threatened to pull out of a 2019 gig in Hyde Park with Bob Dylan unless the promoters ditched their sponsor, Barclays, “a fossil fuel funding entity”. And he has longstanding beef with Spotify. He previously removed his music from the streaming site seven years ago (it later returned), complaining it offered listeners “the worst quality in the history of broadcasting”, a theme he returned to last week, directing his fans to other streaming services that “present my music today in all its high resolution glory”. Young isn’t the first artist to take issue with the world’s biggest music streaming company. Taylor Swift launched a three-year boycott in 2014, after a row over the site’s royalty rates in which she said Spotify was undervaluing art (she subsequently backed down, framing the decision as a gift to her fans). Adele withheld her album 25 from Spotify for months after release; new album 30 was there from the outset, but only after Spotify agreed to change its shuffle function being the default setting when playing albums – a mark of how major stars do have at least some clout with the streaming giants. But Young’s disagreement feels different: it isn’t about money or artistry, but politics, or at least having a social conscience. Swift and Adele are huge streaming artists: they have 10 times Young’s monthly listens on the site. He may be a rock legend, but, in streaming terms, Young is David to Joe Rogan’s Goliath: Rogan’s podcast is the biggest on Spotify, which paid $100m (£82m) for its exclusive rights. There’s vague talk from Spotify of “hoping to welcome [Young] back soon”, a statement with a different tone from its obsequious response to Adele’s shuffle request: “Anything for you”. Young has suggested that others might follow his principled lead: “I sincerely hope that other artists will move off the Spotify platform” he wrote. Thus far, they haven’t. Just as Bob Dylan didn’t have anything to say about Barclays or fossil fuels, high-profile messages of support have been thin on the ground, and no one else has pulled their music in support. Perhaps that reflects Young’s relatively privileged financial status regarding Spotify. Last year, he sold 50% of his publishing rights to the investment fund Hipgnosis, netting him $150m (£112m): that’s a very significant cushion against losing Spotify’s royalties, where an artist is estimated to earn between $3,000 and $3,500 per million streams. Moreover, Young isn’t the kind of artist who needs Spotify. Given the age of his core fanbase, it’s hard not to suspect he makes a lot more money from touring and from physical product – particularly the glut of archival recordings he’s released over recent years (five live albums and a 10 CD box set in the last two years alone) – than he does from people clicking on Heart of Gold or Rockin’ in the Free World. His is a different position from a younger artist, with a younger audience, for whom streaming is the primary means by which fans access their music. They are reliant on pleasing Spotify: getting on playlists to promote their music and growing their fanbase in much the same way as artists were once reliant on getting radio play. The importance of streaming, and of the biggest player in the streaming game, has only been amplified by the effect of Covid on the live industry. Whether it’s healthy for any one company to have quite so much sway is a very moot point, but given the circumstances, it’s an extremely brave and principled artist who risks incurring Spotify’s wrath in 2022 without the kind of financial safety net that Neil Young has.",Arts/Music,Neil Young’s battle with Spotify is principled – and comfortable,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/27/neil-young-spotify-joe-rogan-covid-misinformation
1/28/2022,"The UK government wants to reverse a controversial privatisation deal by seeking to wrest ownership of 38,000 homes in the Ministry of Defence housing portfolio from the billionaire private equity boss Guy Hands. The move is expected to lead to a legal battle between the MoD and Hands’ private equity firm Terra Firma over whether the government can take back full ownership of the homes.  In 1996, under the defence secretary Michael Portillo, the Conservative government sold 57,400 houses used by military service men and women and their families to Annington Homes for £1.7bn in a sale and leaseback deal. In one swoop, Annington became the biggest residential property owner in England and Wales. The MoD rented back the homes on a 200-year lease at a discount but also agreed to pay for their maintenance and refurbishment. The value of the properties has ballooned under Annington’s ownership to many times their original purchase price, meaning the taxpayer has missed out on any profits from the property boom. They were valued by Annington at £7.6bn last year, while their vacant possession value is estimated at £10bn. The MoD is paying about £180m a year in rent plus £140m in repairs and upgrades. Terra Firma, which bought Annington from Nomura Holdings for £3.2bn in 2012, said it would challenge the MoD’s move, and that it expected to win in what it predicted would be a “very long and very expensive” court case. At the time of the deal the MoD hoped to free up cash for renovation as the homes were falling apart. However, the National Audit Office concluded in a 2018 review that taxpayers were between £2.2bn and £4.2bn worse off as a result of the arrangement. The NAO said the MoD had “lost out on billions of pounds’ worth of increases in asset values, while Annington has made a significantly higher return on its investment than expected”. The MoD has terminated its lease on more than 17,000 properties, and now rents just over 38,000 houses and flats from Annington. Jeremy Quin, the minister for defence procurement, said in a written statement to the House of Commons on Thursday: “Given our obligations to secure value for money, we have reviewed MoD’s current arrangements with Annington” and that the “department will explore the exercise of its statutory leasehold enfranchisement rights to buy out Annington’s interest in the homes and gain full ownership rights”. Quin told MPs that the ministry had made a single claim for one house in a test case, and planned to submit a further claim for another house in the near future. He said if the cost of recovering full ownership was less than the present value of the MoD’s ongoing liabilities, “such a transaction is likely to represent good value for money. The MoD would then benefit from any future appreciation in value of the units”. Terra Firma is reportedly looking to sell Annington. Hands was involved in Nomura’s purchase of Annington in 1996, when he worked at the Japanese bank. Under the arrangement, the MoD rents back thousands of houses for members of the armed forces and their families. The original deal gave the MoD a 58% discount on renting the houses for the first 25 years, which was reduced to 49.6% in a rent review that took two years to negotiate and concluded in November. This will increase the rent bill by £36m a year. Quin said the MoD had served notice on Annington under section 5 of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 of its desire to enfranchise a house currently leased from Annington. “Annington, through its lawyers, has notified the MoD that it is considering the impact of the claim and has put the MoD on notice of a potential dispute,” he added. In a statement, Terra Firma said: “Annington has been aware since mid-December of the MoD’s attempt to enfranchise a single property in Cranwell. “This is the first time the MoD has indicated in any forum that it wishes to enfranchise more than one unit. We believe that regardless of any legal merit, reneging on agreements that had been operating for over 25 years is an appalling thing for the British government to do. “Our advice is that while this will be a very long and very expensive legal dispute, we will prevail. However, clearly this does put the sale of Annington on hold. This is clearly extremely negative for the investors who include various UK pension funds and sovereign wealth funds representing strategic military allies of Britain.”",News/Politics,"MoD seeks to buy back 38,000 homes leased from billionaire",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/27/guy-hands-terra-firma-annington-homes-mod-ministry-defence
1/28/2022,"The Italian labour ministry has opened an investigation after a company seeking a female receptionist aged under 30 asked job applicants to include a photograph of themselves in a bathing costume alongside documents proving their credentials. The advert, posted on several specialised job sites by a Naples-based security company, stipulated that the candidate must be female, no older than 30, a fluent English speaker and have their own car and “a sunny character with an attractive appearance”.  “We ask that you send a full photo in a bathing suit or similar,” the advert for the €500-a-month job went on to request. The incriminating line was later removed and the advert reposted, but not before a screenshot was widely shared across social media, sparking outrage. “They want a photo in a bathing suit? What an absurd advert,” said Chiara Marciani, the labour councillor for Naples. “It is scandalous, and for several reasons – beginning with the search for a woman under the age of 30 and a salary that is absurdly inadequate for the commitment and tasks the job requires.” The company, which is based in Naples’ business district, told the Italian press that the request for a bathing suit photo was “inappropriate” and the result of a “mere distraction” by the “inexperienced worker” who crafted the ad and who didn’t understand its policy on gender equality.

The situation was exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, with women disproportionately affected by job losses. Many women are forced to resign after becoming pregnant as they are unable to juggle work and family life, with lack of affordable childcare facilities and inflexible work conditions being among the main reasons. Sexism has also been prevalent in billboard advertisements across Italy, prompting the senate to last year ban adverts on streets and all forms of transports deemed sexist or discriminatory.",News/World news,Italian sexism row over job advert asking for bathing suit image ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/27/italian-sexism-row-over-job-advert-asking-for-bathing-suit-image
