3/1/2022,"A version of this post was originally published on TKer.co. Warren Buffett published his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders on Saturday. You can read it here. Arguably the greatest investor of all time, Buffett is known for timeless insights about investing using very approachable language. Lately, I‚Äôve been thinking about something he said in his 2005 letter: Long ago, Sir Isaac Newton gave us three laws of motion, which were the work of genius. But Sir Isaac‚Äôs talents didn‚Äôt extend to investing: He lost a bundle in the South Sea Bubble, explaining later, ‚ÄúI can calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men.‚Äù If he had not been traumatized by this loss, Sir Isaac might well have gone on to discover the Fourth Law of Motion: For investors as a whole, returns decrease as motion increases. Newton was a pretty smart guy. Much of what we‚Äôre taught in high school physics and calculus can be tracked back to him. And apparently, he had a pretty good track record as a diversified, buy-and-hold an investor. That was before he got crushed speculating on shorter term swings in the stock market. When markets make sharp moves up or down for whatever reason, it can be very tempting to stray from your long-term investment plan and ramp up your short-term trading activity in an attempt to maximize gains and minimize losses. While there may be some opportunities you are able to correctly exploit, there‚Äôs also the very high risk that you mistime the market and do significant irreversible damage to your long-term returns. (Read more here and here.) With every trade comes not one, but two decisions. If you decide to buy, then you also have to know under what conditions you would decide to sell. Similarly, if you‚Äôre thinking about trimming your exposure to stocks because you think the market will go lower in the short-term, then you also have to consider under what conditions you would buy to get back to your target long-term asset allocation. As I wrote in my Thursday newsletter this is ‚Äúparticularly important, because you have to consider scenarios under which prices only rise from‚Äú the moment you sell. These are all good questions to ask upfront as you formulate your investment plan. Perhaps the most important element of prudent investing is having a good plan. By the way, Newton‚Äôs folly was not that he got involved in the South Sea Bubble. Rather, it‚Äôs the fact that he was trading in and out of it. From WSJ columnist Jason Zweig: Prof. Odlyzko estimates that if Newton had bought and held his South Sea shares continuously from early 1712 through 1723, when the stock stabilized after the bursting of the bubble, he would have earned a cumulative total return of approximately 116%. That‚Äôs about 6.5% annually, not counting dividends ‚Äî a generous return at a time when long-term government bonds carried interest rates of 4% to 5%. However, Newton didn‚Äôt buy and hold continuously. If only Newton had given it time.

From there, the S&P surged 6.6% to close Friday at 4,384.65. For the week, the S&P gained a modest 0.8%. The volatility has been attributed to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

This was much stronger than the 1.6% expected by economists. ü§î This spending data comes despite survey data published this week from both the University of Michigan and the Conference Board, which showed consumer sentiment fell amid concerns about inflation. Indeed, on Friday we learned that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs favorite measure of inflation ‚Äî the core PCE price index ‚Äî jumped by 5.2% in January from a year ago, the largest increase since 1983.

From S&P DJI‚Äôs Craig Lazzara: ‚ÄúWe have previously suggested that the strength in the U.S. housing market is being driven in part by a change in locational preferences as households react to the COVID pandemic. More data will be required to understand whether this demand surge simply represents an acceleration of purchases that would have occurred over the next several years rather than a more permanent secular change. In the short term, meanwhile, we should soon begin to see the impact of increasing mortgage rates on home prices.‚Äú Friday comes with the February U.S. jobs report. Economists estimate that U.S. employers added 400,000 jobs during the month as the unemployment rate declined to 3.9%. A version of this post was originally published on TKer.co.

3/1/2022,"This past week, Russia invaded Ukraine. The crisis marks the highest level of geopolitical tensions in Europe in decades. So far, Russia‚Äôs advance has been stalled due to unexpected strong Ukrainian resistance. At the same time, while the US and its allies haven‚Äôt intervened on the ground, they have been supplying arms and financial backing. They have also imposed sanctions and have now cut off a number of Russian banks' access to the SWIFT international payment system, thereby severely restricting Russia‚Äôs trade capabilities. Financial markets are reacting, of course, in a variety of ways. The price of oil is up and at a level not seen since 2014. The Russian stock market has simply collapsed, as has the ruble against the dollar. On Wall Street, stocks fell sharply as the Ukraine crisis grew in recent weeks, and since the Russian invasion have swung wildly down and then up. Volatile times like these usually bring opportunities for investors, if you know where to look. One obvious place to start: stocks in defense companies. Using the TipRanks platform, we‚Äôve looked up several defense stocks that fit a profile: each gets a Buy rating from Wall Street‚Äôs analysts, and each has a double-digit upside for the year ahead. Here are the details. CACI International (CACI) First up is CACI International, an information tech company offering a wide range of services to multiple Federal Government departments, including Defense and Homeland Security. The company‚Äôs services include digital solutions for engineering services and enterprise IT, with applications in command and control systems, AI and deep learning, secure cloud, robotics and automation, and network modeling and simulation. While CACI devotes a large portion of its business to the defense industry, it has significant civilian contracts, as well. In one recent boost for the company‚Äôs civil aerospace technology business, CACI announced this month that it had delivered a high-bandwidth free-space optical modem for use in low Earth orbit ‚Äì a key component of the International Space Station communications system. These are expensive services, provided on long-term government contracts; the result is a long run of highly consistent revenue numbers. CACI‚Äôs top line has held consistently between $1.4 billion and $1.56 billion for the past two years. In its most recent reported quarter, Q2 of fiscal year 2022, released at the end of January, CACI showed $1.5 billion at the top line, and an adjusted EPS of $4.39 per share. The EPS came in slightly below the $4.50 estimate but was up 5% year-over-year. CACI management has stated that it remains committed to delivering value to shareholders, and JPM analyst Seth Seifman sees that as a key point for investors going forward, writing, ‚ÄúCash flow this year is benefiting from a $230m one-time tax benefit, but we expect CACI to continue to generate >$500m of cash flow and growing looking forward. Buybacks at the current price look attractive, but mgmt. noted that they are unlikely to raise debt to buy back stock at the current leverage levels. However, the ~$500m of cash we expect to be generated in 2H22 could be used.‚Äù In line with his comments, Seifman rates the stock as Overweight (a Buy) with a $320 price target to indicate room for 20% upside in the next 12 months. (To watch Seifman‚Äôs track record, click here.) Overall, it‚Äôs clear that Wall Street agrees with this bullish stance. The stock has 6 recent reviews, which include 5 Buys and 1 Hold to support a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $266.08, and their $306.67 average price target implies a 15% upside potential. (See CACI‚Äôs stock analysis at TipRanks.) Teledyne Technologies (TDY) Next up, Teledyne, is an engineering and tech firm that produces high-end electronics and hardware for use in a variety of civilian and defense-related applications. The company operates in four divisions ‚Äì instrumentation, digital imaging, aerospace & defense electronics, and engineered systems ‚Äì and its product line includes such devices as digital imaging sensors and cameras with visible, infrared, and X-ray capabilities; marine monitoring and control instrumentation; electronic test and measurement equipment; aircraft information management systems; and defense satellite communications systems. Teledyne operates in the US and Canada, along with the UK and Western Europe. Teledyne has grown to its current incarnation ‚Äì it is a $20 billion company ‚Äì through a policy of smart acquisitions. Its most recent such move, completed in May of 2021, was the acquisition of FLIR Systems, a video surveillance leader, for $8 billion. The newly acquired company will operate as a subsidiary under the name Teledyne FLIR. In a more recent announcement, Teledyne this month made public a $16 million Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with the US Geological Survey. The contract will run for 5 years, and includes products and services from across Teledyne‚Äôs Marine portfolio. At the end of January, Teledyne delivered its Q421 report, showing strong results. Quarterly revenues came in at $1.375 billion, a company record, and the non-GAAP EPS of $4.56 was up 31% yoy and beat the pre-release forecast by 8%. The company reported annual revenues of $4.61 billion for 2021, up 49% from 2020. 5-star analyst James Ricchiuti, covering this stock for Needham, considers Teledyne as ‚Äúperhaps the most consistent company in our universe of advanced industrial technology stocks, with a proven track-record in M&A and the ability to navigate through challenging environments in its various market verticals.‚Äù Ricchiuti sees the FLIR deal as key to the company‚Äôs prospects, writing, ‚ÄúTDY's acquisition last year of FLIR Systems represents the largest M&A deal the company has undertaken, and we believe has been a game-changer in terms of enhancing TDY's infrared detector and sensor technologies footprint while giving it access to new defense growth opportunities for unmanned ground-based vehicles and drones and potentially longer-term in ADAS applications for the automotive market.‚Äù Ricchiuti‚Äôs Buy rating comes with a $520 price target that suggests a potential upside of 21% by the end of 2022. (To watch Ricchiuti‚Äôs track record, click here.) There are 7 recent reviews of Teledyne on record, with 6 Buys over 1 Sell for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock has an average price target of $536, for a 25% upside potential from the current trading price of $428.63. (See Teledyne‚Äôs stock analysis at TipRanks.) Kratos Defense (KTOS) The third stock on our list, Kratos, is more of a pure-play defense stock than CACI or Teledyne. Kratos focuses mainly on customers in the US National Security sector, including the US Navy and Air Force, the Missile Defense Agency, the US Intelligence Community, NASA, and Foreign Military Sales. The company designs and develops a wide range of platforms and products for this customer base, from unmanned aircraft to satellite communication systems, to cybersecurity and cyberwarfare systems to hypersonic technology. The company works to change the way that technological breakthroughs are brought to the markets. Kratos released its latest quarterly results last week, beating both the top-and bottom-line estimates. Revenue hit $211 million. This was up just 2.5% year-over-year but came in $3.2 million above Wall Street‚Äôs forecast and amounted to the best quarterly top line in over two years. The full-year 2021 top line of $811 million was up more than 8% from 2020. The company‚Äôs Space, Satellite, and Cyber division lead the full-year gains, increasing almost 19% to reach $276.3 million. In earnings, Kratos reported that adjusted quarterly EPS grew yoy from 8 cents to 11 cents (a gain of 37%), and beat the 9-cent estimate by a 22% margin. RBC‚Äôs 5-star analyst Ken Herbert points out the drawback for a company in relying on Federal contracts ‚Äì to wit, waiting for Congress to pass a budget, but believes that shouldn‚Äôt deter investors. He writes, ‚ÄúThe juxtaposition of the near-term budget uncertainty and the longer-term upside for KTOS remains frustrating for investors. We continue to view much of the risk for KTOS as timing related, which is why we are remaining bullish on the stock. We do expect fundamentals to continue to improve with the passage of the FY22 budget and to see a corresponding uptick in 2H22.‚Äù Herbert‚Äôs bullish outlook translates to an Outperform (Buy) rating, while his $24 price target implies a one-year upside of 28%. (To watch Herbert‚Äôs track record, click here.) The Moderate Buy consensus rating here reflects an even split from the Street‚Äôs analysts ‚Äì the 8 reviews divide 4 to 4 on Buys and Holds. KTOS is selling for $18.68, and the $22.50 average price target suggests 20% upside this year. (See Kratos‚Äô stock forecast at TipRanks.)

3/1/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- With Russia‚Äôs stock market closed, U.S. exchange-traded funds are signaling the scale of the rout facing the nation‚Äôs equity market. Most Read from Bloomberg Belarus Preparing to Send Soldiers, Report Says: Ukraine Update World‚Äôs Biggest Plane Destroyed in Russian Attack on Airfield SWIFT Russian Ban Could Force Fed to Step In, Credit Suisse Says Putin Races the Clock as Fast Military Advance ‚ÄòFrustrated‚Äô U.S., Europe Cut Some Russian Banks From SWIFT: Ukraine Update The VanEck Russia ETF (ticker RSX) and the iShares MSCI Russia Capped ETF (ERUS) plunged 26% and 20%, respectively, in U.S. trading early Monday. Millions have poured into the funds in the past week, some of which was likely create-to-lend activity in which new shares are created for short sellers to borrow and bet against. The Bank of Russia halted trading in Moscow on Monday, one of several measures unleashed in a bid to shield the nation‚Äôs economy from sweeping sanctions. That has turned the two ETFs, which primarily track Russian energy stocks, into useful price-discovery tools for traders seeking to navigate the geopolitical turmoil caused by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. ‚ÄúThe ETF has proven itself time and time again, especially around geopolitical events when liquidity is difficult to access,‚Äù said Athanasios Psarofagis, a Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst who noted that the ETFs predicted moves last week in Russia‚Äôs markets. ‚ÄúETFs are suppose to be index trackers, but when that process breaks down, they take on the role of price-discovery vehicles -- and it‚Äôs impressive how accurate they have been.‚Äù RSX and ERUS have plunged more than 40% in 2022 as geopolitical risks build, ranking them as the two worst-performing non-leveraged U.S.-listed ETFs so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The losses have accelerated in the past week in the face of mounting sanctions, with the U.S. banning transactions with Russia‚Äôs central bank, the Russian National Wealth Fund and the Ministry of Finance. The drop for the Russia-tracking ETFs is reminiscent of March 2020, when fixed-income funds continued to trade even as cash markets effectively froze amid pandemic-fueled turmoil.

3/1/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Iraq stopped oil production from two southern fields with a combined capacity of almost half a million barrels a day. Most Read from Bloomberg EU Discusses Sanctions on Tycoons; Dollar Surges: Ukraine Update U.S., Europe Cut Some Russian Banks From SWIFT: Ukraine Update Musk Activates Starlink Satellites in Response to Ukraine Plea Putin Races the Clock as Fast Military Advance ‚ÄòFrustrated‚Äô Germany to Boost Military Spending in Latest Historic Shift The shutdowns curtail the ability of OPEC‚Äôs second-largest member to pump crude just as Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and tight supplies globally send prices soaring. The operators of Nasiriya and West Qurna-2 have said nearby fields will be able to produce more to compensate for the temporary losses. Work at Nasiriya, capable of supplying as much as 80,000 barrels a day, was halted on Saturday because of protests that prevented staff from reaching the site, according to a statement from Thiqar Oil Co. That followed the closure of the huge West Qurna-2 field on Feb. 21 for maintenance. The field, which can pump 400,000 barrels a day, is scheduled to resume normal operations on March 14, though the companies that run it are trying to restart output sooner. State-owned Basra Oil Co. said the work will enable production from West Qurna-2 to be increased to 450,000 barrels a day. Russia‚Äôs Lukoil PJSC has a stake in the field. OPEC Struggles The outages come as many OPEC members, including Iraq, struggle to reach their production quotas, causing global energy markets to tighten as demand recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. Iraq pumped 4.16 million barrels a day in January, less than its target of almost 4.3 million, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. That was because of bad weather at ports and the country should meet its quota for February, Oil Minister Ihsan Abdul Jabbar said in an interview on Feb. 21. Iraq has repeatedly said it is able to pump as much as 5 million barrels-a-day. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners -- a 23-nation group including Russia -- meet on March 2 to decide on output for April. Major OPEC members such as Saudi Arabia have come under pressure in recent months to raise production faster and rein in oil prices, which temporarily surpassed $100 a barrel on Thursday after Russia attacked Ukraine. Brent crude fell 1.2% to $97.93 a barrel on Friday, but is still up 26% this year.
