2/2/2022,"Hello, my name is Arwa Mahdawi and I would like to cancel myself, please. I have a book to sell, you see, and it would seem that the easiest way to drum up a lot of free publicity these days is to declare yourself the latest victim of cancel culture. Suddenly everyone is inviting you on the telly to wax on about how you’ve been cruelly silenced by the woke mob. “Nobody can say anything any more!” the usual pundits lament in their 972nd piece on whether cancel culture has gone too far. “Free speech is dead! It’s just like Nineteen Eighty-Four!” I don’t know if Big Brother is going to let me share this, but I have something terribly shocking to tell you about cancel culture. Here we go: you should definitely be worried, but it’s not the woke mob you need to be worried about. A depressing amount of energy is being expended on arguing whether calling someone out for using language a lot of people perceive as bigoted is “cancel culture”. But, while endless arguments rage about the intolerant left, free speech is under a terrifying assault from the right.  Want to know what real cancel culture looks like? Well, just sit back and look at the unprecedented surge of book banning efforts happening across the United States. Last year, for example, a county prosecutor’s office considered charging library employees in a conservative Wyoming city for stocking books about sex education and containing LGBTQ themes. Around the same time, Moms for Liberty, a rightwing advocacy group, tried to get a number of books banned from Tennessee schools because they contained content that disturbed them. They deemed a book about Galileo to be “anti-church”, and were outraged that a book about Martin Luther King contained “photographs of political violence”. More recently, a school board in Tennessee banned Maus, Art Spiegelman’s Pulitzer prize-winning graphic novel about the Holocaust, from its classrooms. Their reasoning? It contained eight swear words and a picture of a naked cartoon mouse. Yep, you read that right. What upset these people most about a book detailing how Jewish people were gassed to death in concentration camps by Nazis were some curse words. Let’s be clear: there is nothing particularly novel about uptight school boards in conservative areas getting worked up over material they deem offensive. However, what is happening in the US at the moment is a lot scarier than a few over-involved parents clutching their pearls over naked mice. As the American Library Association noted last year, there has been a “dramatic uptick in book challenges and outright removal of books from libraries.” The free-speech organisation, PEN America, has voiced similar concerns. “It’s a pretty startling phenomenon here in the United States to see book bans back in style, to see efforts to press criminal charges against school librarians,” the organisation’s chief executive recently told the New York Times. It’s not just school boards trying to police what kids can read about: it’s politicians, too. Last year, Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, introduced proposed legislation that would let parents sue schools for teaching critical race theory to kids. To be cute, he called this the Stop the Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees (W.O.K.E) Act. Now, Florida is trying to pass a bill that critics have nicknamed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, which would let parents sue schools or teachers who bring up topics related to sexual orientation and gender identity. (Just a little reminder to everyone that DeSantis loves describing Florida as a beacon of freedom, in what he deems to be an increasingly authoritarian America.) In an interview with the Washington Post last week, Spiegelman warned that what is happening now should be seen as a “red alert”. Maus being banned was no anomaly, but “part of a continuum, and just a harbinger of things to come”. What can I say? If it’s the “woke mob” that scares you after all this, then you must be fast asleep.

2/2/2022,"How do you get health workers to do something as personally intimate and publicly important as getting vaccinated? The government’s response was, until this week, “get vaccinated or get out”. Those in the know have long disagreed with this. The British Medical Association is strongly in favour of vaccines and encourages all its members to get the jab – but it admits that “mandating Covid-19 vaccination raises a number of complicated ethical and practical issues”. The Royal College of Nursing strongly recommends that “all members are vaccinated as soon as they can be” – but is also clear that making the vaccine compulsory could undermine its uptake, and “significantly impact on the retention of staff”. Both the BMA and the RCN made their stances clear to the government as early as last September. But ministers did not listen. In December, the RCN once more expressed its concerns and called on the government to delay the vaccine mandate. The government ignored it again – until now, when, with a staffing disaster approaching, ministers have been forced to acknowledge the facts and back off from compulsory vaccination.  Perhaps this U-turn is better late than never. But the danger is that in backtracking, the government has sent a message that vaccines aren’t as important as before (indeed ministers are already spinning the story to suggest that their screeching U-turn is actually due to the lowered severity of Omicron). This could undermine uptake in a different way – making people who may have been planning to have the vaccine believe it is no longer necessary to do so. So let us be absolutely clear: the issue is not that vaccine mandates are no longer needed. They were never a good idea to begin with. If the government is to move forward without damaging vaccine uptake, it needs to acknowledge this mistake. The first step is to recognise, as the BMA and RCN have done, that the issue is not about whether NHS staff should be vaccinated. Of course they should – we are still in the middle of a serious pandemic. The issue is how to best maximise uptake of the vaccine. And all evidence points towards the fact that vaccine mandates have mixed effects, which ultimately increase people’s resistance to vaccines. Most people who are unvaccinated are not anti-vaxxers (those who are against vaccines on principle) and are not even vaccine hesitant (those who have genuine doubts and questions about the vaccine). They are vaccine indifferent. They simply haven’t got round to it. For them, little things will make a difference (which is why there is a correlation between vaccine uptake and how far you are from a vaccination centre), as will big things. If you give them a strong reason – like mandation – to get a jab, they will. That is why, when various forms of mandation are introduced you will see an initial surge of people queueing up outside the vaccination centres, as in France. But it is a very different story for those who do have questions and doubts – especially doubts about whether vaccines are being done to them rather than for them. In this case, compulsion runs the danger of confirming their doubts and therefore increases their resistance. If they can escape compulsion (say, by leaving a job), they will. Even if they can’t and they concede in the present, you are only storing up trouble for the future; people will always look for other ways to express their defiance, and may become even more negative about further vaccinations. To put it slightly differently, the issue here is one of trust. When people have doubts, do they listen to those rolling out the vaccines or those opposing the vaccines? If you use compulsion (and also if you berate unvaccinated people as fools and as selfish), you damage trust and drive people who are vaccine hesitant into the arms of the anti-vaxxers who tell them “you see, they are not interested in you, they simply want to control you”. That is why groups with lower vaccination take-up are those which have an already troubled history of trust with authorities – people who are deprived or unemployed, and, in particular groups such as Black Caribbean people, about two-thirds of whom have not yet received three jabs. It is hardly coincidental that a 2020 parliamentary report showed that a similar percentage of Black British people “do not believe that their health is equally protected by the NHS compared to white people”. The best way to increase vaccination rates among these groups is to focus on rebuilding trust. That is why the World Health Organization stressed at the start of the vaccine rollout in January 2021 that “community engagement should be at the centre of all Covid-19 vaccine introduction activities”. That involves working in and through communities. It means starting from a position of respect: acknowledging that people have genuine and serious questions about the vaccine that need answering. It means listening to people, understanding their concerns, answering them and also not hiding any problems. The case for vaccination is strong enough without pretending vaccines are perfect, and overstating the case will only undermine trust as problems emerge. This is painstaking work. It is not glamorous and nor is it an instant fix. But, as scientists argued early on, “participatory community engagement is cost-effective, increases uptake of vaccines, and substantially reduces healthcare resources needed to achieve high vaccination coverage”. Some of the best examples of this come from healthcare settings involving local initiatives with the support of local mosques and predominantly Black churches to reach ethnic minority healthcare workers. There is a more general message in all this. When people don’t listen to you, the answer is not to shout louder and wave a stick. It isn’t to use compulsion. The answer is to listen more, and to respect your audience. That is the way to improve vaccination rates in the NHS. That is also the way to rebuild the trust of the public more generally.

2/2/2022,"Tom Brady, the most successful quarterback in NFL history, has brought his brilliant career to an end after 22 seasons and seven Super Bowl victories. News of the 44-year-old’s apparent retirement had emerged over the weekend before he said he was still deciding his future. However, on Tuesday he confirmed his final game came when his Tampa Bay Buccaneers lost to the Los Angeles Rams in the playoffs last month.  Official word from Tom Brady: pic.twitter.com/jWCQAi9Vb8 “I have always believed the sport of football is an ‘all-in’ proposition – if a 100% competitive commitment isn’t there, you won’t succeed, and success is what I love so much about our game,” Brady said in his statement on Instagram. “There is a physical, mental and emotional challenge EVERY single day that has allowed me to maximize my highest potential. And I have tried my very best these past 22 years. There are no shortcuts to success on the field or in life. “This is difficult for me to write, but here it goes: I am not going to make that competitive commitment anymore. I have loved my NFL career, and now it is time to focus my time and energy on other things that require my attention. I’ve done a lot of reflecting the past week and have asked myself difficult questions. And I am so proud of what we have achieved. My teammates, coaches, fellow competitors, and fans deserve 100% of me, but right now, it’s best I leave the field of play to the next generation of dedicated and committed athletes.” Brady’s ruthless commitment to winning was legendary and there were few, if any signs, his skills had dimmed at an age when most NFL players have long since retired. In his final season he was as consistent and as dominant as ever, leading the league in passing yards (5,316), touchdowns (43), completions (485) and attempts (719). His list of achievements is almost as long as his career. His seven Super Bowl wins – six with the New England Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last season – are the most by any player in NFL history. He also holds the NFL record for career passing touchdowns (624) and passing yards (84,250). “My playing career has been such a thrilling ride, and far beyond my imagination, and full of ups and downs,” Brady said in Tuesday’s statement. “When you’re in it every day, you really don’t think about any kind of ending. As I sit here now, however, I think of all the great players and coaches I was privileged to play with and against – the competition was fierce and deep, JUST HOW WE LIKE IT. But the friendships and relationships are just as fierce and deep. I will remember and cherish these memories and re-visit them often. I feel like the luckiest person in the world.” Brady was famously undervalued coming out of college. 198 players – six of them quarterbacks – were selected in front of Brady in the 2000 NFL draft before the New England Patriots picked him. He started as New England’s fourth-string quarterback and slowly worked his way up to become Drew Bledsoe’s back-up. When Bledsoe was injured early in the 2001 season, Brady took over and never looked back: seven Super Bowl victories, three NFL MVPs, 15 Pro Bowls and a claim as one of American’s finest-ever athletes were to follow.",Sport/Sport,Tom Brady retires from NFL after 22 seasons and seven Super Bowl victories,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/01/tom-brady-retires-nfl-quarterback-patriots-buccaneers-football
2/2/2022,"There are “extensive failures” in the way child sexual exploitation by criminal gangs is tackled, with police and authorities potentially downplaying the scale of abuse over concerns about negative publicity, a damning report has found. Child victims – some of whom reported being raped, abused and, in one case, forced to perform sexual acts on a group of 23 men while held at gunpoint – were often blamed by authorities for the ordeals they suffered while some were even slapped with criminal records for offences closely linked to their sexual exploitation.  The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) said there was “a flawed assumption” that child sexual exploitation was “on the wane”, with councils and police forces denying the scale of the problem, despite evidence to the contrary. The report concluded this might be down to a determination to assure they are not seen as “another Rochdale or Rotherham” – towns blighted by recent child sexual exploitation revelations – rather than a desire to “root out … and expose its scale”. Prof Alexis Jay, who chaired the inquiry, said: “The sexual exploitation of children by networks is not a rare phenomenon confined to a small number of areas with high-profile criminal cases. We found extensive failures by local authorities and police forces in the ways in which they tackled this sexual abuse. “There appeared to be a flawed assumption that child sexual exploitation was on the wane. However, it has become even more of a hidden problem and increasingly underestimated.” The report, the 18th from the IICSA since it was established, featured testimony from more than 30 young witnesses across six case study areas – Bristol, Durham, St Helens, Swansea, Tower Hamlets and Warwickshire. The inquiry team said it “did not receive a reliable picture of child sexual exploitation” from these areas, with the data often “confused and confusing”. It said there was evidence of child sexual exploitation by networks in all six areas, but that the relevant police forces were “generally not able to provide any evidence about these networks”. Two areas – Swansea and Tower Hamlets – said there was no data to suggest there had been any child exploitation by gangs, despite evidence to the contrary. The report concluded: “It was clear from the evidence that none of the police forces or local authorities in the case study areas in this investigation had an accurate understanding of networks sexually exploiting children in their area.” There were also examples of victim-blaming, the report found, with children being described as “promiscuous” and “putting themselves at risk” in referrals to a support charity in St Helens. Similar language about victims’ behaviour was reflected across the inquiry. In Swansea, a child was described on official paperwork as having had “sexual partners from the age of 11”. Victims, many of whom had a history of self-harm and running away from home, repeatedly described how their allegations against their perpetrators were routinely dismissed by police. In some cases, children were even landed with criminal records. In one case, a girl abused from the age of 12 described how she was convicted of several offences including possession of a weapon after chasing her abuser with a bread knife after he assaulted her. The report said senior leaders within local authorities and police forces must take the lead on “eradicating attitudes and behaviours which suggest that children who are victims of exploitation are in some way responsible for it”. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support for rape and sexual abuse on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland, or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland.

2/2/2022,"The recent decision by Neil Young and Joni Mitchell to pull their music off Spotify amid a backlash over Joe Rogan’s podcast has put fans of the folk icons in an awkward position – and reminded us that music can find a home beyond the now ubiquitous Spotify playlist. Rogan, who has been accused of spreading Covid-19 misinformation through his wildly popular podcast, has since promised to “try harder”, while Spotify has said it will direct listeners toward facts about the pandemic. But for some, it might be too little too late, especially if other artists follow in the boycott.  So for users wanting to join the musicians in protest and get their tunes elsewhere, here are some options. At the risk of stating the obvious, Spotify isn’t the only place to stream. Apple Music, Amazon Music, YouTube Music, and Tidal all have hundreds of millions of titles. And Apple has already capitalized on the Spotify chaos by recently declaring itself the “home of Neil Young”. It takes some effort, but it’s possible to transfer your precious tunes from Spotify to other services. Through third-party tools like FreeYourMusic, Soundiiz, and SongShift, users can select which songs and playlists to transfer, and the software will do the rest. Many have success with the free versions of the software, but if you have an enviable library with thousands of songs, you may have to pay a premium. Y2K mania is already in full force, and the technology of the aughts offers valuable alternatives to music streaming. And what better way to honor the early 2000s than dusting off that iPod Shuffle that your Gen Z cousin has been using as a hairclip? Pandora is another old favorite that can work its way back into the rotation, and you can get Neil and Joni’s music on it, too. For fans of podcasts, other options include apps like Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, Audible, RadioPublic, and TuneIn, which probably have most of your favorite programs. TuneIn even offers access to 100,000 radio stations for your listening pleasure. If sharing Spotify Wrapped playlists and stats has become an end-of-year ritual, fear not. Last.fm is a music streaming site (and app) where at-home analysts can still get their fix. The service has charts galore – it creates stats based on users’ own listening each week and has a myriad of other charts that track what everyone is listening to around the world, every day. And if you’re in the mood to support lesser-known artists, you could turn to services such as Bandcamp and SoundCloud, which cater to independent musicians but also feature bigger names. Young people may prefer streaming over the radio, but with stations for nearly every genre and a professional DJ spinning, it could be high time to reconsider. You could even call into your local station and request your favorite Neil Young hits. Or you could celebrate the remarkable resurgence of vinyl, which set a modern-era sales record in December – and play Neil’s and Joni’s classic albums the way they were meant to be played.",News/Technology,Missing Joni and Neil?

2/2/2022,"Amnesty International has joined other leading human rights groups in stating that Israel’s “system of oppression and domination” over the Palestinians amounts to the international definition of apartheid. The report immediately prompted fury among Israeli politicians who called for it to be withdrawn.  Among them was Israel’s foreign minister, Yair Lapid, who rejected the report as “divorced from reality”, saying: “Amnesty quotes lies spread by terrorist organisations.” Lapid also accused Amnesty of antisemitism. “I hate to use the argument that if Israel were not a Jewish state, nobody in Amnesty would dare argue against it, but in this case, there is no other possibility,” Lapid said. The report was welcomed, however, by the Palestinian Authority, which said it hoped it would open the way to prosecution of Israel at the international criminal court. “The state of Palestine welcomes the report by Amnesty International on Israel’s apartheid regime and racist policies and practices against the Palestinian people,” the authority’s foreign affairs ministry said. Amnesty called on “the USA, the European Union and its member states and the UK, but also those states that are in the process of strengthening their ties – such as some Arab and African states [to] recognise that Israel is committing the crime of apartheid and other international crimes”. It asked countries to “use all political and diplomatic tools to ensure Israeli authorities implement the recommendations outlined in this report and review any cooperation and activities with Israel to ensure that these do not contribute to maintaining the system of apartheid.”. The 278-page report compiled over a period of four years by the London-based rights group means that Amnesty has joined the ranks of Human Rights Watch and the Israeli rights group B’Tselem who have also accused Israel of apartheid in the last year. “Whether they live in Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, or Israel itself, Palestinians are treated as an inferior racial group and systematically deprived of their rights,” Amnesty’s secretary general, Agnès Callamard, said while introducing the report, as she rejected claims of antisemitism. “Israel’s cruel policies of segregation, dispossession and exclusion across all territories under its control clearly amount to apartheid.” While in the past much of the focus of claims of Israeli apartheid has focused on conditions in Palestinian areas seized by Israel during the six day war in 1967, including the West Bank where dual systems of rights and legal administrations exist for Palestinians and Jewish settlers, allegations of apartheid within Israel are more controversial. A year ago, B’Tselem drew criticism from Israeli politicians when it asserted that Israeli policies had been designed to enforce “Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea”. The New York-based Human Rights Watch in April last year became the first significant international rights group to publicly level the allegation of apartheid, part of a growing international movement to redefine the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a struggle for equal rights rather than a territorial dispute. Those efforts have gained strength in the decade since the peace process ground to a halt, as Israel has consolidated its control over the occupied territories and soured on the idea of a Palestinian state. Israel rejects any allegation of apartheid and insists that its own Arab citizens enjoy equal rights. Complicating the issue is the different experiences of Palestinians in the occupied territories compared with Palestinian citizens of Israel. While Palestinians who remained inside Israel lived under military rule until shortly before the 1967 war, those Palestinians now have citizenship, including the right to vote, but still face widespread discrimination in areas such as the job and housing markets. Palestinians in the West Bank live – despite a degree of political autonomy – under Israeli military rule, which includes exposure to the Israeli military justice system, while Jewish settlers on the West Bank are dealt with under Israeli civil law. For their part, those living in Hamas-ruled Gaza – from which Israel withdrew in 2005 while keeping tight control of land and the maritime border – also face a crippling Israeli and Egyptian blockade.",News/World news,Amnesty International calls Israel’s actions against Palestinians apartheid,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/01/amnesty-international-calls-israel-actions-against-palestinians-apartheid
