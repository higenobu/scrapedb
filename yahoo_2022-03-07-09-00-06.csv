3/7/2022,"Lucille Ball was accused of being a communist in 1953 by the media. Her daughter Lucie Arnaz said she was ""scared"" of losing her career and that Desi Arnaz ""took charge."" Desi Arnaz really did phone former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, who publicly cleared Ball. In an interview for Amazon's new documentary ""Lucy and Desi,"" Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's daughter Lucie Arnaz provides insight into what things were like for the Arnaz family in 1953, when the Los Angeles Herald-Express accused Ball of being a communist by running the headline ""Lucille Ball a Red"" in red ink. Lucie said in an interview for ""Lucy and Desi"" that her mother ""was scared that people wouldn't believe"" she wasn't really a communist. ""This could destroy everything that they had,"" Lucie recalled in the documentary interview. ""And my father took charge that week."" Ball had classified herself as a member of the communist party when she registered to vote in 1936. Ball's brother Fred said in archive footage shown in the documentary that he and his sister ""did register communist"" in order to ""pacify"" their grandfather, Fredrick Charles Hunt, who raised them and ""was always for the working man."" In 1953, Ball was interviewed by both the FBI and The House Committee on Un-American Activities, which was created so that members of Congress could investigate ""disloyalty to the country by private citizens, public figures and organizations suspected of having fascist or Communist ties,"" according to The Wrap. ""They interviewed her about it at great length and they cleared her,"" Lucie said in the documentary about her mother's experience with The House Committee on Un-American Activities. But that didn't stop the Los Angeles Herald-Express from running their ""Lucille Ball a Red"" headline. Lucie, who was only about two years old at the time, said Arnaz took matters into his own hands to protect his wife. ""He invited all the press into our house and he told them exactly what my mother had done, that she had never been involved in the communist party,"" Lucie said. Arnaz actually took clearing his wife's name to an extra level, as depicted in Aaron Sorkin's 2021 film, ""Being the Ricardos."" He invited members of the press to a live taping of an episode of ""I Love Lucy"" and got the director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover ""on the phone,"" Lucie said in the new documentary. Lucie recalled Hoover telling Arnaz over the phone, in earshot of the studio audience, ""Your wife is cleared of any charges. 100 percent clear."" Arnaz then introduced Ball to the audience, and according to Lucie, her father delivered one of his most famous lines then: ""The only thing red about her was her hair, and even that was not legitimate."" According to Lucie, Ball received a standing ovation from the audience at the time. ""Lucy and Desi"" is now available on Amazon Prime Video.

3/7/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan may take more action in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine which could significantly impact Japan's energy sector, a senior ruling-party lawmaker said on Sunday, while expressing caution toward a complete end to Russia oil and gas usage. Sanctions against Moscow - such as freezing assets, banning exports of high-tech goods and excluding some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments network - are having a major impact, said Hiroshige Seko, upper house secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party. ""What's important above all is to let Russia change action,"" Seko said. ""There's a possibility we may impose further sanctions, which could have ramifications for the energy sector through financial institutions involved with transactions."" ""Sanctions could have a big impact on (Japanese) people's livelihoods, so we would have to seek their understanding for the sake of solidarity with Ukraine,"" Seko told a political debate programme on public broadcaster NHK. Russia's invasion of Ukraine over a week ago has led to a string of big companies halting their businesses in Russia. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"". The Japanese government and companies own stakes in oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in Russia, including two on Sakhalin Island from which partners Exxon Mobil Corp and Shell PLC have announced they will exit. ""If we exit from Sakhalin 1 and 2 projects, (oil and natural gas) supply would be disrupted while countries like China who are desperate for LNG would get it cheaply,"" Seko said, considering the costs Japan bore developing the projects. ""We must consider it realistically."" Japan decided on Thursday to freeze the assets of four Russian banks from April 2, taking to seven the total number Tokyo has slapped with such sanctions. The government has frozen assets of Russian oligarchs as well as Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko who has backed Russia's invasion. It also decided to ban Belarus-bound exports.
