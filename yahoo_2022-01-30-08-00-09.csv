1/30/2022,"By Yew Lun Tian BEIJING (Reuters) -China's foreign ministry and an official newspaper have accused the United States of planning to interfere with and ""sabotage"" the Beijing Winter Olympics by paying athletes from some countries to make half-hearted efforts in competition and to criticise China. The allegations were made a week before the Games start amid tensions between the two superpowers that has included a diplomatic boycott of the event by the United States, which has been joined by several other countries. Asked about the Chinese allegations, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing on Saturday reiterated a previous position that Washington was not coordinating a global campaign regarding participation at the Olympics. China Daily, an English-language newspaper run by the ruling Chinese Communist Party's Publicity Department, on Friday evening cited unnamed sources as saying United States has a plan to ""incite athletes from various countries to express their discontent toward China, play passively in competition and even refuse to take part"". In return, it said, Washington would provide a large amount of compensation and ""mobilise global resources"" to help protect the reputation of athletes of who choose to compete passively. Asked if the Chinese foreign ministry believes the allegation to be valid, a ministry spokesperson told Reuters on Saturday that the report has ""exposed the real intention of some Americans to politicise sports and to sabotage and interfere with the Beijing Winter Olympics."" The spokesperson said he strongly condemned the attempts by some Americans to ""buy off"" athletes and ""cause trouble"" during the Games, adding that these attempts are ""doomed to fail"". A U.S. Embassy spokesman told Reuters by email on Saturday, ""We were not and are not coordinating a global campaign regarding participation at the Olympics."" ""U.S. athletes are entitled to express themselves freely in line with the spirit and charter of the Olympics, which includes advancing human rights,"" the spokesman said. The United States announced in December a diplomatic boycott of the Games over what it called China's human rights ""atrocities"", a move that was followed by allies Australia, Britain and Canada but that does not prevent U.S. athletes from travelling to Beijing to compete. China rejects allegations of human rights abuse and has repeatedly lashed out against the politicisation of the Games. In a message to convey greetings for the Chinese New Year festival next week, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told China-based foreign diplomats that China ""has the confidence and ability to remove the interference"" and turn the Winter Games into an event that promotes friendship and mutual understanding.

1/30/2022,"Carville said Sinema won't defeat Rep. Gallego if he runs against her in a 2024 Democratic primary. When asked about Sinema, Carville told Vox that he has ""no idea what the hell she's thinking."" The senator has come under fire for her refusal to change filibuster rules to pass voting-rights legislation. The longtime Democratic strategist James Carville threw cold water on Sen. Kyrsten Sinema's chances for reelection if Rep. Ruben Gallego challenges her for the party's 2024 Senate nomination in Arizona. In a recent Vox interview that was published on Thursday, Carville expressed confidence in Gallego's chances if he were to launch a primary run against the freshman senator, who was first elected in a 2018 race against then-Republican Rep. Martha McSally to great fanfare among state Democrats. Sinema has come under withering criticism by many Democratic voters and activists, with many Arizonans incensed that she declined to back filibuster reform to pass the party's marquee voting-rights bills and was critical of some elements of President Joe Biden's Build Back Better agenda. ""She's not going to win a primary against Rep. Ruben Gallego, I'll tell you that damn much,"" he told the publication. ""And I will personally volunteer to help him fundraise because I think we can keep that seat if he runs."" As the chief strategist of former President Bill Clinton's successful 1992 campaign, Carville helped the Democratic Party break a 12-year GOP lock on the White House and has expertise in crafting winning candidate messages. However, he was stumped when asked by Vox writer Sean Illing about Sinema's motivations. ""I can't explain it, and no one else can. The only explanation people have given is that she wants to be the next John McCain,"" he said, referencing the late Arizona Republican senator and military war hero known for his political independence. He continued: ""I've never met her, I have no idea what the hell she's thinking. I've talked to people who know her and the only theory they have that makes any sense is that she views herself as some kind McCain-esque maverick. But look, I'm out of gas on this one. I really am."" However, Carville was much more receptive to a 2024 reelection campaign by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, pointing to the senator's ability to win in 2018 despite representing a state that former President Donald Trump carried by overwhelming margins in 2016 and 2020. ""Understand that Joe Manchin is a Roman Catholic Democrat in a state in which not a single county has voted Democrat [for president] since 2008. I repeat: not a single county has voted Democrat since 2008,"" he said. He added: ""Politics is about choices, and he's up for reelection in 2024. If Manchin runs for reelection, I'll do everything I can to help him ... It ain't Joe Manchin or Ed Markey. You got to understand that. It's really that damn simple."" Manchin said last November that he was undecided on whether he'd run for the Senate again in 2024. As a Democrat representing one of the most conservative states in the country, Manchin's decision will be critical as the party's hopes to maintain and build on their majority will run through red states like West Virginia and Montana in an era where political polarization has become a huge part of the electoral landscape. However, Sinema represents a politically-competitive state that Biden won in 2020, and her seatmate is Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, who is up for reelection this fall and backed filibuster reform. Last week, the Arizona Democratic Party censured Sinema for her vote to keep the 60-vote filibuster threshold in place in the upper chamber, arguing that voting rights were too important to fall by the wayside. During a recent CNN appearance, Gallego didn't say if he would run for the Senate but was critical of Sinema's tenure in office. ""I've known Senator Sinema since we were both in our mid-20s and starting out in politics here in Arizona. The only consistency about Senator Sinema's roles and positions is inconsistency,"" he said. He added: ""2024 is a long time from now. I'm focusing on 2022. I never say no to the future. But, he added, 'I think at this point right now she is really disappointing a lot of Arizonans.'""

1/30/2022,"FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) — A woman who once lived in Kansas has been arrested after federal prosecutors charged her with joining the Islamic State group and leading an all-female battalion of AK-47 wielding militants. The U.S. Attorney in Alexandria, Virginia, announced Saturday that Allison Fluke-Ekren, 42, has been charged with providing material support to a terrorist organization. The criminal complaint was filed under seal back in 2019 but made public Saturday after Fluke-Ekren was brought back to the U.S. Friday to face charges. Her alleged participation in the Islamic State had not been publicly known before Saturday's announcement. Prosecutors say Fluke-Ekren wanted to recruit operatives to attack a college campus in the U.S. and discussed a terrorist attack on a shopping mall. She told one witness that “she considered any attack that did not kill a large number of individuals to be a waste of resources,” according to an FBI affidavit. That affidavit from FBI Special Agent David Robins also alleges that Fluke-Ekren became leader of an Islamic State unit called “Khatiba Nusaybah” in the Syrian city of Raqqa in late 2016. The all-female unit was trained in the use of AK-47 rifles, grenades and suicide belts. In all, the affidavit cites observations from six different witnesses, including some who have been charged with terrorism offenses and some who were held at prison camps for former Islamic state members. A detention memo filed Friday by First Assistant U.S. Attorney Raj Parekh states that Fluke-Ekren even trained children how to use assault rifles, and that at least one witness saw one of Fluke-Ekren's children, approximately 5 or 6 years old, holding a machine gun in the family's home in Syria. “Fluke-Ekren has been a fervent believer in the radical terrorist ideology of ISIS for many years, having traveled to Syria to commit or support violent jihad. Fluke-Ekren translated her extremist beliefs into action by serving as the appointed leader and organizer of an ISIS military battalion, directly training women and children in the use of AK-47 assault rifles, grenades, and suicide belts to support the Islamic State’s murderous aims,” Parekh wrote. According to court papers, Fluke-Ekren moved to Egypt in 2008 and traveled frequently between Egypt and the U.S. over the next three years. She has not been in the U.S. since 2011. Prosecutors believe she moved to Syria around 2012. In early 2016, her husband was killed in the Syrian city of Tell Abyad while trying to carry out a terrorist attack, prosecutors said. Later that year, prosecutors say she married a Bangladeshi ISIS member who specialized in drones, but he died in late 2016 or early 2017. Four months after that man's death, she again remarried a prominent Islamic state leader who was responsible for the Islamic State group's defense of Raqqa. She told one witness in 2018 that she instructed a person in Syria to tell Fluke-Ekren's Family she was dead so the U.S. government would not try to find her, according to Parekh's memo. Photos from a family blog called 4KansasKids  show her and her children in the years they traveled between Kansas and Egypt, posing at the base of the pyramids in Egypt and playing in the snow in the U.S. A  2004 article about homeschooling in the Lawrence Journal-World featured Fluke-Ekren and her children. She told the paper she pulled her kids from public school because she was dissatisfied with how her children were performing in public and private schools. Homeschooling allowed her to teach Arabic to her kids. Court papers do not indicate how she was captured, or how long she was in custody before being turned over to the FBI Friday. She is scheduled to make an initial appearance at U.S. District Court in Alexandria on Monday, at which time she would likely be appointed an attorney.",U.S./Associated Press,Feds: Kansas woman led all-female Islamic State battalion,https://news.yahoo.com/feds-kansas-woman-led-female-140752694.html
1/30/2022,"One board member appeared quite shaken over a parent’s use of a racial slur. A Grosse Pointe, Michigan mother went viral this week after using a racial slur during a school board meeting about diversity. The unidentified white woman went on a rant during Monday’s meeting about her son getting in trouble at Grosse Pointe South High School for saying the N-word on Snapchat, Click On Detroit reports. “Well, you know what? I have two young white boys. One of which got in trouble for saying the N-word on Snapchat,” said the parent. She defended her son, saying “his dark chocolate auntie got him into Straight Outta Compton.” “My address was put out there,” the mother continued. “We were threatened, and why? Because he said [the N-word]. I’m sorry, this happens to be in every song. The FCC, the Jon Connors, the who’s who are in charge of this s—, are basically allowing this.” A board member cut her off and politely warned the woman to “watch your language.” The woman went on to describe herself as “an inner-city person” who is down with the culture, as she “intentionally put” her son “in very primarily all-Black dance class, sales school, you name it, I’m into all of those things.” One board member appeared quite shaken over the woman’s racial slur. “I’ve never heard the N-word used in front of our colleagues here, and this is very upsetting,” said Grosse Pointe Public Schools Board member Margaret Weertz. “And I don’t — I have the floor. We need to talk about politics. We don’t disparage people — we don’t use slurs of any kind.” “And the argument that it can be heard in other places is the most offensive argument and has led to countless atrocities in our history,” said Grosse Pointe Public Schools Superintendent Jon Dean. Several Grosse Pointe residents are outraged that the woman was allowed to continue speaking after uttering the N-word. Some parents reacted to the moment in a private Facebook Page for Grosse Pointe residents. Famed civil rights attorney Ben Crump saw the viral video, writing on Twitter: “A parent used the n-word in a Grosse Pointe Public Schools Board meeting … and board members didn’t address her offensive comments until AFTER she finished speaking! What example are they setting for our children by allowing this disgusting language to continue?!” Per the school’s policy against vulgar and profane language, the woman’s son was reportedly suspended for four to 10 days for using the N-word online. “This idea that you see something racist right in front of your face and you don’t address it is a poor reflection on the school board and the school district because it means you don’t care,” said Greg Bowens of the Grosse Pointe and Harper Woods NAACP. He received an outpouring of calls from residents who were upset that board members didn’t immediately condemn the woman. “I think she could’ve made her point without making those comments,” Bowens added. In a statement after the meeting, Grosse Pointe School Board President Joseph Herd reacted to the backlash over allowing the woman’s rant to go on after she hurled the N-word. “If you have watched any board meeting during my time as president, you have seen me emphasize how critical it is for us to model civil discourse and listen to all voices, even when we disagree,” Herd said. “By nature and professional training, I am a peacekeeper. But do not think my willingness to listen means I or the board agree with the use of such language. We condemn this language.” Have you subscribed to theGrio’s “Dear Culture” podcast?

1/30/2022,"SCHUYLERVILLE, N.Y. (AP) — The thousands of people paid to plant corn, pick apples and milk cows in New York often work long days, six days a week — and earn overtime only after 60 hours of labor. New York took a big step Friday toward lowering that threshold when a state board voted to recommend that a 40-hour overtime rule for farm workers be phased in over the next 10 years. If the recommendation is approved by the state labor commissioner, New York would join California and Washington state in phasing in an overtime threshold common in other industries. The vote by the three-member wage board capped a series of public hearings this month that heated up debate over compensation for agricultural workers in New York, many from Mexico, Guatemala and other foreign countries. “We need a better quality of life,” veteran dairy worker Lazaro Alvarez said this week. He is among those who say the change is long overdue for an estimated 55,000 agricultural workers in New York. But the prospect is alarming farmers. They warn the extra costs would wipe out marginal farms, hobble others and actually reduce workers' earnings if farmers cap hours to manage expenses. “While the industry overall may survive, many individual farms will not,” Chris Laughton of Farm Credit East, a lender for the agriculture industry in the Northeast, testified this month. At Welcome Stock Farm near Saratoga Springs, Bill Peck said overtime after 40 hours for the farm’s 18 full-time employees would cost him up to an extra $12,000 a month. Dairy farmers like Peck say they cannot simply raise prices to reflect added expenses, since wholesale milk prices are regulated. “We aren’t going to be able to invest in a new tractor. We aren’t going to be able to invest in adding another barn,” said Peck. “That money is going to go just into payroll, so which is good for them in the short term, but long term the business can’t survive.” Crop farmers who grow vegetables and apples say they would be particularly hard hit when extra seasonal labor is needed. They say higher overtime costs will make them less competitive with farms in other states. Farm workers in New York didn't qualify for overtime pay at all until 2020, when the state changed the law to mandate extra pay for workers who exceeded 60 hours a week. The new law also instructed the wage board to consider whether to recommend a lower threshold. The board voted Friday to lower the farm threshold by four hours every other year, starting with overtime after 56 hours on or after Jan. 1, 2024. Farmworkers would be able to earn overtime after 40 hours in 2032 under the recommendation. The board still needs to make a formal recommendation to Gov. Kathy Hochul’s labor commissioner, who can accept, reject or modify them. “We did something very historical today,” said board chairperson Brenda McDuffie. The recommendations were approved in a series of 2-1 votes, with member David Fisher, representing the New York Farm Bureau, opposing them. Average hourly wages for agricultural workers in the region last year were $16.16, according to federal figures, though some earn the minimum wage of $13.20. Alvarez, 63, of Mexico City, said overtime after 40 hours would reduce stress for workers like himself and give them a better quality of life. ""I will be able to have checkups at the doctor, I will be able to buy personal items. I will have time for me,” Alvarez said in Spanish. California has already been lowering farm overtime levels in phases over several years. Larger farms in California had to begin providing overtime after 40 hours starting this year. Farms with 25 or fewer employees will hit the 40-hour mark in 2025. Washington approved a law last year phasing in overtime pay for agricultural workers. Several other states offer some farm workers overtime, with limitations and exceptions. Trent Taylor, an attorney with the advocacy group Farmworker Justice, said more states are considering the proposals as the nation grapples more with labor and racial issues. “We’re gaining momentum,” Taylor said. Nationally, farm workers were excluded from the overtime provisions of the landmark 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act. At the time, the U.S. was only 73 years removed from outlawing slavery. Advocates say continuing to leave them out perpetuates an injustice against a profession long dominated by people of color. “This exclusion of farm workers is the very definition of what we call structural racism. It was a policy rooted in racism 85 years ago and has become so baked into the system that people don’t even realize it anymore,” said Lisa Zucker, an attorney with the New York Civil Liberties Union. Farmers argue that the well-meaning policy would not be in the best interests of the many migrant workers who come north during harvest seasons to make as much money as possible, often to send back home. That's because they could be forced to limit hours to mitigate overtime expenses. “Hours will go down and there will be less net pay for people,” said Mark Russell, of Two of Clubs Orchard in western New York. Farmers are worried about losing workers to other states, he said. Several farm workers made similar arguments in testimony this month. Though hiring more employees is a common strategy for reducing overtime costs, farmers say the labor market is tight and hiring workers would require farmers to invest in more housing. Farms routinely provide free housing to workers. Worker advocates dismiss farmers’ dire predictions, noting that other industries have adapted to overtime and that New York farms have already adapted to higher minimum wages and 60-hour overtime. ""If there’s one lesson to glean from this pandemic, it’s that those who compromise their health, safety and well-being to keep our essential industries going deserve dignity and respect,"" Emma Kreyche of the Worker Justice Center testified recently. ___ Associated Press writer Claudia Torrens in New York City contributed to this report.",U.S./Associated Press,Farmers alarmed as NY looks at expanded overtime for workers,https://news.yahoo.com/farmers-alarmed-ny-looks-expanded-145525315.html
