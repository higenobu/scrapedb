4/7/2022,"A Bill Clinton-appointed judge rejected Trump's request that he recuse himself from Trump's RICO case against Hillary Clinton. Judge Donald Middlebrooks ruled that to warrant recusal, ""more must be involved than solely my appointment to the bench"" 25 years ago ""by the spouse of a litigant now before me."" Middlebrooks also pointed out that 3 cases cited in Trump's motion for recusal ""do not appear to support his arguments."" A federal judge on Wednesday rejected former President Donald Trump's request that he recuse himself from overseeing Trump's sweeping lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, people linked to her campaign, and former FBI and DOJ officials. Trump's lawyers said in their motion for recusal that US District Judge Donald Middlebrooks should step aside because he was appointed to the federal bench by then-President Bill Clinton. ""Due to the fact that Judge Middlebrooks has a relationship to the Defendant, HILLARY CLINTON's husband, by way of his nomination as Judge to this Court, this amounts to prejudice so virulent or pervasive as to constitute bias against a party,"" their filing said. Middlebrooks in his Wednesday ruling acknowledged that Bill Clinton appointed him to the court. ""Although former President Clinton is not a party to this lawsuit, I will give Plaintiff the benefit of the doubt and equate the interests of the Clintons for the sake of analysis here,"" the filing said. Even so, the judge found that Trump's argument doesn't hold water, writing that ""to warrant recusal, something more must be involved than solely my appointment to the bench twenty-five years ago by the spouse of a litigant now before me."" He also pointed out that the three cases that were cited in Trump's motion for recusal ""compel no different conclusion, and indeed do not appear to support his arguments."" In an accompanying footnote, Middlebrooks said that in the first case, Hamm v. Members of Board of Regents of Florida, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ""held that a district court judge did not exhibit bias sufficient to warrant recusal based on certain statements he made at trial."" None of the cases cited ""discussed whether judicial appointment by a party, without more, would cause a reasonable person to suspect bias on the part of the presiding judge,"" Middlebrooks wrote. And the ruling in one of them ""emphasized that, to establish bias justifying disqualification, a party must demonstrate 'such pervasive bias and prejudice that it constitutes bias against a party' — a showing that certainly has not been made here."" In all, ""the law is well settled"" that merely being appointed to the bench by a litigant does not ""create in reasonable minds ... a perception that [the judge's] ability to carry out judicial responsibilities with integrity, impartiality, and competence [would be] impaired,"" Middlebrooks concluded, quoting the judicial code of conduct. Wednesday's ruling was widely expected given that, as Politico reported, it's exceedingly rare for courts to grant motions seeking the recusal of judges based on the political party of the president who nominated them. Middlebrooks also made that point, writing, ""Every federal judge is appointed by a president who is affiliated with a major political party, and therefore every federal judge could theoretically be viewed as beholden, to some extent or another."" ""As judges, we must all transcend politics,"" he continued. ""When I became a federal judge, I took an oath to 'faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all duties ... under the Constitution and laws of the United States' ... I have done so for the last twenty-five years, and this case will be no different."" Trump's sweeping racketeering lawsuit against Clinton and the other defendants accused them of conspiring to fabricate evidence during the 2016 campaign tying him to ""a hostile foreign sovereignty."" It dismissed any ""contrived Trump-Russia link."" It also recycled other claims Trump has made about former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign and the 2016 election. Specifically, it said Mueller exonerated ""Donald Trump and his campaign with his finding that there was no evidence of collusion with Russia."" And it said the ""Mueller Report demonstrated that, after a two-year long investigation coming on the heels of a year-long FBI investigation, the Special Counsel found no evidence that Donald Trump or his campaign ever colluded with the Russian government to undermine the 2016 election."" Mueller concluded in 2019 that the Russian government interfered with the 2016 US election to damage Clinton and propel Trump to the Oval Office. But his final report specified that investigators evaluated the relevant events from ""the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of 'collusion.'"" Prosecutors ultimately determined that there was not ""sufficient evidence"" to charge anyone on the Trump campaign with conspiring with Moscow. But they noted that the campaign ""expected it would benefit electorally"" from Russia's efforts. Hillary Clinton's spokesman Nick Merrill said in an earlier statement to Insider that the lawsuit was ""nonsense."" Charles R. Davis contributed reporting.

4/7/2022,"RENO, Nev. (AP) — A single, desperate cry for help went through to family members too late to save a woman’s husband after the Indiana couple had been lost in Nevada’s high-desert wilderness for more than a week. “37.757753, -117.809568. Help.” It was a delayed text with GPS coordinates from Beverly Barker, 69, who survived the ordeal and was reported in good shape at a Reno hospital Wednesday, the day after rescuers found her and the body of her husband, Ronnie, 72. Their nephew, Travis Peters, said in a Wednesday Facebook post that he can only assume that as his aunt was being airlifted to the hospital — or perhaps her belongings were being brought down the mountain — her phone came into cell range and the message was sent late Tuesday. “Now we know it arrived too late,” wrote Peters, who has been highly critical of law enforcement for what he says was too little too late in terms of a search for the Barkers. The couple was found Tuesday in the mountainous, forested high-desert in the remote Silver Peak area of Esmeralda County about 177 miles (284 kilometers) northwest of Las Vegas, west of Goldfield and east of the California line. Both were with the Kia passenger car they had been towing behind a 32-foot (9.8-meter) motor home before the RV got stuck in mud. They apparently decided to try to continue on in the car before it too got stuck. Because of rough roads in the area, authorities opted to have Beverly Barker airlifted to a Reno hospital to be checked out, Mineral County Undersheriff Bill Ferguson told The Associated Press. She had melted snow for water and the car provided shelter from temperatures that dipped into the 30s (-1.1 C) at night, he said Wednesday. “She would get out and go for little walks.” Family members who reported the Barkers missing have said in numerous social media posts they left on a cross-country trip last month and were expected to return this week to their home in Indianapolis. They said the couple departed Albany, Oregon, on March 27 and planned to meet with friends in Tucson, Arizona, on March 29. One of four aircraft that had been searching for the couple with the Civilian Air Patrol spotted the RV from the air about midday on Tuesday. “Due to the remote area where the motorhome was located it took several hours for (search and rescue) teams to reach it,” the Esmeralda County sheriff's office said in a statement Wednesday. “After a search of the motorhome, it was determined foul play was not involved,” it said. It said the teams then found tire tracks they were able to follow to the Kia about 2 miles (3 km) away. Esmeralda County sheriff's officials haven't responded to requests for additional information. Ferguson said he has no idea how the couple ended up where they did. “What led them down that path, I don’t know. I don’t know if it was GPS or Google. I don’t know why they were there,"" Ferguson said. “It was just one bad decision after another,"" he said. “At some point I would have thought they would have stopped sooner and disconnected the car. They probably lost their direction, took a wrong turn and then the car became stuck.” Ferguson said the couple had video that indicated they were in the Silver Peak area since March 27, but he didn’t have information on when Ronnie Barker died or the cause of his death. Patrick Donnelly of the Center for Biological Diversity, who has been in the area numerous times as his group protests a planned lithium mine where an extremely rare desert wildflower grows, said a single graded road crosses the mountain range in that area coming west out of Silver Peak. “Getting an RV towing a vehicle up that road would be insane, but within the realm of possibility,” he said Wednesday. Peters, the couple's nephew who lives in Indiana, directed most of his criticism about the handling of the search at Esmeralda County Sheriff Kenneth Elgan, who did not immediately respond Wednesday to phone calls or emails seeking comment. Peters said in his social media posts that ""my sorrow is just overshadowed by the fact that they didn’t get to them in time.” He said his uncle might still be alive “if a search had been initiated in a more timely manner (not 3+ days after we reported them missing).” Peters told KVVU-TV in Las Vegas the death creates a hole in the family that will never be filled. “He’s just a bigger-than-life personality,” he said. “Thank God that Beverly is alive, because she will be able to fill in those blanks that we don’t know. Why did they go up the mountain? What happened? She's going to be able to tell us."" ___ Davenport reported from Phoenix, Arizona",U.S./Associated Press,Missing Indiana couple found after man dies in Nevada desert,https://news.yahoo.com/nevada-official-missing-indiana-couple-163228775.html
