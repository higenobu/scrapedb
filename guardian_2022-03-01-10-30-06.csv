3/1/2022,"Ash Barty has celebrated her 110th consecutive week as the tennis world’s No 1 by ticking a special place in her homeland off her bucket list. The Australianmay have travelled the world but only this week did she have the opportunity to visit Uluru for the first time. Barty, who on Monday retained her place at the top of the WTA rankings, has spent the past few days learning more about her Indigenous roots in the red centre of Australia before a return to the tour at Indian Wells next week for the first time since claiming her maiden Australian Open title. “It’s really hard to put into words, just because it’s a feeling,” Barty told Tennis Australia. “When you actually go to Uluru for the first time like I did, it was just an incredible experience for me to understand how much of a spiritual connection Uluru has for so many communities. “But also as a child, as an Aboriginal girl growing up, it’s the heartbeat of our nation … being able to experience that first-hand is something I always wanted to do. To be able to allow myself, through my profession and through my career, to have this opportunity was really special.” The proud Ngarigo woman visited Uluru and Alice Springs in her capacity as Tennis Australia’s First Nations ambassador and she had a hit with local school students as part of the Racquets and Red Dust program, with the iconic scenery serving as a backdrop. “They are incredible athletes,” Barty said of the students. “They started playing tennis a couple of days ago and we were already having some rallies, which is just mind-blowing. I think it brings people together, first and foremost. It allows people to feel safe in an environment. “Of course, there’s the health and wellbeing attributes that come with being fit, being outdoors and I think the education also comes with the opportunity. It’s learning a new skill, it’s talking to people, it’s learning different ways of life, connecting with people that come from all walks of life.” Barty’s imminent return to the tour coincides with her 117th week at the top of the world rankings – a feat she now shares with Justine Henin as the seventh highest number of weeks spent as No 1 in women’s tennis history. Her run of 110 consecutive weeks spent as No 1 is the fifth longest streak in history and, given her substantial lead in the rankings over the world No 2, Aryna Sabalenka (Barty has 8,330 points to the Belarusian’s 5,563), she is likely to overtake the American Chris Evert’s fourth-best mark of 113 next month.",Sport/Sport,‘Heartbeat of our nation’: Ash Barty ticks off lifelong goal with visit to Uluru,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/01/heartbeat-of-our-nation-ash-barty-ticks-off-lifelong-goal-with-visit-to-uluru
3/1/2022,"Austrac has launched court action accusing James Packer’s Crown Resorts of breaching anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws and continuing to contravene the law due to wholly inadequate oversight by management. In a lawsuit filed with the federal court on Tuesday, Austrac, Australia’s financial intelligence agency, said ongoing failures to properly vet risky customers – including those brought in from overseas by junket operators and locals with links to people already banned from Crown’s Melbourne and Perth casinos – accounted for 547 breaches of anti-money laundering laws. Each alleged breach of the law if proven could attract a penalty of up to $22.2m, meaning Crown faces a fine that could theoretically exceed $12bn. However, if Austrac’s action succeeds, a far smaller penalty is likely. The current record fine is $1.3bn, which Westpac agreed to pay to settle allegations by Austrac that the bank breached AML/CTF laws more than 23m times, including by allowing a dozen customers to transfer money to the Philippines in a way consistent with child exploitation. From March 2016, just 60 high-risk customers turned over $70bn at Crown’s casinos, pumping $1.1bn in losses into the company’s coffers, Austrac said in a concise statement filed with the court. Austrac alleges that Crown failed to do appropriate due diligence on these customers, which it said included junket operators and players, foreign politically exposed people – a category that can include government officials and their families – as well as people who had been arrested for money laundering or were suspected of being “connected to organised crime”. The regulator alleges that “many engaged in large cash transactions and transacted with cash that appeared suspicious, including cash in plastic bags, shoeboxes or cardboard boxes, cash in rubber bands, small denominations of notes and counterfeit cash”. It alleges that an additional 447 customers engaged in transactions that Crown’s external consultants later identified as typical of money laundering or terrorism finance. Some customers allegedly engaged in multiple breaches. The legal action follows an investigation that Austrac’s chief executive, Nicole Rose, said showed that Crown failed to put in place and maintain an AML/CTF program that would mitigate the risk that its casinos were misused for money laundering. “They also failed to carry out appropriate ongoing customer due diligence including on some very high-risk customers,” she said. “This led to widespread and serious non-compliance over a number of years. “Austrac has taken this strong action to achieve enduring change and ensure that Crown will fully meet their obligations to protect themselves and Australia’s financial system from criminal activity.” She said Crown was working to improve its systems, “however there is further work to do and Austrac will continue to work closely with Crown to address ongoing compliance concerns”. Crown said it was reviewing the statement of claim filed with the court by Austrac. It said it “has developed a comprehensive remediation plan which is intended to position Crown as a leader in the industry in its approach to governance, compliance, responsible gaming and the management of financial crime risk”. “The plan is underpinned by an uplifted organisational culture.” Allegations that Crown’s casinos were being used for money laundering were made by Nine Entertainment’s newspapers and its flagship current affairs TV show, 60 Minutes, in 2019. Inquiries in both NSW and Victoria found that Crown facilitated money laundering at its Melbourne and Perth casinos and that some junket operators were linked to organised crime.

Packer’s dominance of the Crown empire, which was also criticised by the inquiries in NSW and Victoria, is set to end after the company’s board said it was ready to accept an $8.9bn takeover offer from US private equity group Blackstone.

3/1/2022,"With its immense size, dagger-like teeth and sharp claws, Tyrannosaurus rex was a fearsome predator that once terrorised North America. Now researchers studying its fossils have suggested the beast may not have been the only tyrannosaurus species. Experts studying remains thought to belong to T rex have suggested their variation shows evidence of not one species but three. The lead author of the research, Gregory Paul, who was a dinosaur specialist on the film Jurassic Park, said the findings had multiple implications, noting that previously experts had studied the growth of the T rex using remains from different rock layers. “That may not be a good idea to do because you may be [looking at] different species,” he said. The team say it is to be expected that more than one tyrannosaurus species evolved over their million-or-so years on Earth, as has been found for other dinosaurs who lived at the same time, such as triceratops. Writing in the journal Evolutionary Biology, Paul and colleagues report how previous work has revealed that fossilised bones designated as being from T rex vary in terms of their stout build or “robustness”, and different specimens had one or two pairs of lower incisor-like teeth. Paul and colleagues studied a total of 37 specimens attributed to T rex, in particular looking at the length and circumference of the thigh bones, available for about two-thirds of the specimens, to assess their robustness. The team say their findings suggest differences in the robustness of the thigh bones are unlikely to be down to individual variation. “We found that the robustness in the sample we have of tyrannosaurus, the variation of the femur is greater than all other tyrannosaurids combined over 10m years of evolution,” said Paul. “You can’t just not pay attention to that.” The team say the variation does not appear to be linked to the overall size of the specimen or how mature the animal was when it died, while other factors – such as the uneven ratio of more robust bones to those that were more slender, or “gracile” – suggests such variation is unlikely to be linked to the sex of the beasts. What’s more, fossils with more gracile bones were only found in higher layers of sediment, and these and more robust specimens found alongside them tended to have only one incisor-like tooth in the lower jaw, in contrast to the robust specimens in lower layers. While the team say they cannot rule out other explanations for the findings, they propose that specimens found in lower layers are probably from one species they have called Tyrannosaurus imperator, or tyrant lizard emperor; the later, stocky-boned specimens are from Tyrannosaurus rex; and the slender-boned specimens are from a third species the team have called Tyrannosaurus regina, or tyrant lizard queen. Prof Steve Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the work, said he was not convinced. “I understand the temptation to divide T rex into different species, because there is some variation in the fossil bones that we have. But ultimately, to me, this variation is very minor and not indicative of meaningful biological separation of distinct species that can be defined based on clear, explicit, consistent differences,” he said. Prof Thomas Carr, a T rex expert at Carthage College in the US, also disputed the results, saying the definitions of the different species put forward by the team were vague, and the findings were at odds with his own work in which he analysed variations in 1,850 different features in 31 specimens. “I found no evidence of more than one species. And if that signal was in the data, I would have picked it up,” he said. Carr said another concern was that the study included specimens from privately owned or commercial outfits, affecting the ability of researchers to reproduce the results. Nevertheless, Paul said it would be decades before there were enough museum specimens to do a statistical analysis. He said the variations were significant. “Other dinosaurs species have been named on less data,” he said.",News/Science,"Tyrannosaurus rex may have been three species, scientists say",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/01/tyrannosaurus-rex-may-have-been-three-species-scientists-say
