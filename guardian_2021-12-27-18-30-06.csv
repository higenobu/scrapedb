12/27/2021,"In 2019, when he was living in Berlin, the Irish author Rob Doyle wrote a short weekly column about his favourite books for the Irish Times. The series began with The Unwomanly Face of War, Svetlana Alexievich’s oral history of Soviet war widows, and ended, 51 books later, with The Colossus of Maroussi, Henry Miller’s Greek travel memoir of 1941. In between came, well, everything, from Virginia Woolf to Virginie Despentes, via Carl Jung, Philip K Dick and The Tibetan Book of the Dead, each introduced with unstuffy critical acuity and lapel-grabbing comic hyperbole: “Is it preposterous to suggest that Fyodor Dostoevsky prophesied the election of Donald Trump, Brexit and the seething hate-pits of social media?”Readers of Doyle’s autobiographical novel Threshold won’t be shocked that these columns, collected in his new book, fall hardest for writers mischievously lugubrious in outlook – Michel Houellebecq, say, or the Romanian author EM Cioran. Freud’s Civilization and Its Discontents gets a thumbs-up for its “honest theoretical acknowledgment of the unbridled aggression, depravity and lust for annihilation that constitute the dirtiest secret of the individual in society”, while Nietzsche’s On the Genealogy of Morals “might be one of the greatest horror novels ever written”; Joris-Karl Huysmans’s À rebours, “a kind of 19th-century American Psycho” about a sickly aristocrat’s outré self-help programme, which Doyle read while tripping on psychoactive cacti in Bolivia, is plain “evil”.  Inserted between these snippets of high-grade consumer advice are longer, looser reflections written upon Doyle’s return to Ireland early in 2020, a visit that became a long-term stay on account of you know what. Thus does the book morph into a Covid-era tour of Doyle’s psyche, as he reflects while stuck at home on a roving youth spent in druggy squats and house shares in London and Paris, bumming around Asia and Latin America with the cash earned from sorting supermarket coupons on a Dublin industrial estate.Uppermost on his mind is sex, relegated by the pandemic to a memory, save for half-hearted clicks on PornHub (“like a nightmarish roam through an infinite wet market”), to say nothing of a lockdown-breaking “amatory visit” to his girlfriend. Amid moist-eyed recollections of a three-way at a Berlin nightclub or the Vietnamese lover he followed to San Francisco, we’re told how Doyle didn’t attempt to be faithful, even in a serious relationship. In the darkest days of 2020, he lost his nerve while drafting a tongue-in-cheek Facebook post that he feared his friends might take seriously, because it actually wasn’t wholly light-hearted: “If there’s a silver lining to all this, it’s that the new generation won’t get to enjoy the freedoms I made such a beast of myself exploiting.”Doyle’s self-guying impulses make him good company on the page. When he imagines writing a book such as Thomas Bernhard’s My Prizes, in which the Austrian writer recalls his experience of accepting various awards (Doyle’s version would be made up of “acerbic speeches to mark the literary prizes I did not win”), the ensuing rant about “some schmoozing chump win[ning] the latest popularity contest with her bullshit book” is funny, not only bitter, in part because Doyle recognises he’s no outsider. He talks of an ex-lover who is a lauded French novelist and says Geoff Dyer (a heavy influence) still texts him about an epic night out they once shared; Rachel Kushner told him that, inspired by an idea about a Houellebecq scholar he gave up after 10,000 words, she’s going to make the French writer a character in her forthcoming novel. Contradiction, or many-sidedness, is one of the pleasures of this charmingly provocative enterprise, you suspect for the author as much as for us (the catalogue of his drug intake, for one, left me amazed that he had managed to read so much, let alone write). But if the navel-gazing rubs you the wrong way – as Doyle well knows it might, handily providing a preemptive three-page list of objections to his own work – there’s always the consumer advice: Arthur Koestler’s first novel, The Gladiators and Marguerite Duras’s Practicalities are just two of the books I’m itching to get hold of after reading what he says about them and it’s not the least of Doyle’s paradoxes that this self-declared hater should be so infectious an enthusiast.

12/27/2021,"Iam on the phone to my mother for what feels like the fifth time in as many hours. This time, I am asking her what on earth I am supposed to put in the box asking for the value of my furniture. I am, to clarify, trying to renew my flat’s contents insurance. Mum sighs. Her frustration is understandable. I call her all the time, to ask whether I should switch energy supplier or which flight to book. I panic about whether to file things alphabetically or chronologically (and it ends up being neither), or whether to pay my flat’s service charge monthly or quarterly. On the face of it, the anxiety I have around personal admin is hard to understand. After all, I am perfectly happy to do much more traditionally anxiety-inducing things: public speaking, exams or writing about myself online. The insurance renewal, though, has been bothering me – I’d already put it off until the last possible day.  Undoubtedly, part of the problem is that I am an only child who gets on well with her parents; it’s always been very easy to ask them for help. I am happy with the exams and the writing and the public speaking because I feel like I know what I’m doing. With the British Gas engineer, not so much. In an attempt to become a functioning adult, I ask life coach Jo Wheatley to help me step out of my comfort zone. I am determined to become more organised, decisive, independent and capable. Everyone has core values, she explains, that determine how we think and act. Perfectionists tend to value personal achievement and pleasing others, and associate getting something wrong with failure and letting people down. As she tells me this, I nod and laugh – I have been sussed out in under five minutes. Situations that cause stress – say, when your contents insurance deadline is approaching – are an especially effective trigger for perfectionism, Wheatley explains, because at its core, is the belief: “I am only OK if I am right.” The key lies in rewriting that belief and switching it to: “I am OK if I get this done.” It’s also a pretty good rebuff to perfectionism’s close cousin: procrastination. Just do it. “We can start with laughing at ourselves,” Wheatley says. Recognise that your expectations might be ludicrously high; why on earth are you worrying about finding the most efficient way to file old water bills? But there are also practical steps that the admin-averse can take, such as time-blocking, a scheduling technique where even small tasks are given their own space on a calendar. This gives us a defined time period in which to do something. As Wheatley puts it: “We know when we get to the end of that time block, we are going to send that email off.” “Celebrating is also really important,” she says. It’s helpful to “reward ‘good enough’” as much as you would perfection, so your brain gets the message that it’s OK. Last, Wheatley recommends “having an accountability partner”, like a coach or mentor, who can listen to your worries, as well as provide honest feedback. I take the last suggestion as permission to continue calling my mum when I really need to. Then I set myself half an hour to make an informed guess about my furniture. I send the form. In the days after my chat with Wheatley, I time-block doing my expenses, and submit them in one sitting. I send emails when they are “good enough”. I am not quite reformed, but I can see that progress is possible. At the end of the week, I pour myself a glass of wine. I have, after all, been told to celebrate.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Escape your comfort zone: Personal admin is my nemesis. So I decided to break its horrible hold over me,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/27/escape-your-comfort-zone-personal-admin-is-my-nemesis-so-i-decided-to-break-its-horrible-hold-over-me
12/27/2021,"For dancers, not being able to dance isn’t just a denial of their art, but of their existence. As they practised in their kitchens during lockdown, or staged impromptu performances on outdoor stages, you could sense the pent-up energy, the desire to move waiting to be released.  Some choreographers managed to make the most of their skills on film. William Forsythe’s The Barre Project set New York City Ballet’s Tiler Peck and three exceptional male partners spinning and jumping in a tribute to every dancer’s daily ritual. Rambert, under the direction of Benoit Swan Pouffer, turned the company’s London base into a performance space, for experiment and exploration in works that varied from the intriguing (Jo Strømgren’s Rooms) to the frankly bizarre (Wim Vandekeybus’s Drawn from Within). Four intelligent films about international choreographers at work boosted the Edinburgh festival’s dance programme. But you could sense the relief when dancers were finally allowed to return to the stage in May. The Royal Ballet’s exceptional dancers emerged like bullets from a gun in a series of well-judged bills that highlighted both their appetite for the new – a sensational performance of Crystal Pite’s The Statement – and their respect for the past in works by Balanchine (a memorable Apollo) and Jerome Robbins (a lyrical Dances at a Gathering). In its 90th anniversary year, it’s good to see the company in such thrilling form, which also illuminated full-length performances of Romeo and Juliet and Giselle. Wayne McGregor’s long postponed The Dante Project was the premiere of the year, with Thomas Adès’s surging score unlocking depths of emotion. Birmingham Royal Ballet’s dancers look wonderfully honed and ready too, but director Carlos Acosta (who took over the company just as Covid struck) has yet to find a repertory that both redefines them and lets them shine. English National Ballet came back with a dazzling performance at Sadler’s Wells of works it had already showcased on film, including Russell Maliphant’s fine Echoes and Arielle Smith’s exhilarating Jolly Folly. Akram Khan’s long-awaited Creature was a muddled disappointment but Jeffrey Cirio’s agonised definition of the tormented soul at its centre was the performance of the year. Khan’s opaque new work for his own company, Outwitting the Devil, shared Creature’s bleak sense of oppression but contained some sensationally beautiful movement. Matthew Bourne was also in a darker mood than sometimes, with The Midnight Bell using the novels of Patrick Hamilton to create a world flecked with melancholy desires and despair. Ballet Black commissioned two effective new pieces in Will Tuckett’s thoughtful Then or Now and Mthuthuzeli November’s dazzling The Waiting Game. I missed Northern Ballet’s Merlin, choreographed by Drew McOnie, but enjoyed its revival of David Nixon’s Dangerous Liaisons. Scottish Ballet’s film of Gene Kelly’s Starstruck was an exuberant end to that company’s year. In a Covid-related bonus, Dangerous Liaisons, like many of the dance performances I have loved, is still available to watch online – an extension of access that is an undoubted bonus of a difficult time. Technology produced another bonus. The influential dance-maker Robert Cohan died in January at the age of 95, having just completed, over Zoom, a series of solos called Afternoon Conversations With Dancers that were as vital and vivid as anything I saw this year. 1.

12/27/2021,"There was a moment, two and a half hours into the greatest men’s high jump competition in Olympic history, where no one had the foggiest idea what was going on. A second earlier, the Italian Gianmarco Tamberi and the Qatari Mutaz Barshim had been calmly talking to an official. Now they were high-fiving, leaping into each other’s arms, and pogoing in pure delirium. Tamberi then collapsed and began rolling around the track with his hands on his face as if he had been possessed, or shot, or possibly both – while Barshim was using his coach’s shoulder to soak up his tears. It turned out that the most joyous and life-affirming moment of the sporting year was unfolding before our eyes. And soon it wasn’t only Tamberi and Barshim overcome by emotion; the rest of us also found ourselves wiping something from our cheeks.  Until Tokyo there had not been a shared Olympic track and field gold medal since 1912. Yet towards the end of an extraordinary high jump final, in which six men were still jumping at 2.39m, Tamberi and Barshim were still unable to be separated. As the judge began to talk to both men about having a jump off, an idea formed in Barshim’s head. “Can we have two golds?” the Qatari asked, thinking out loud about whether he might be allowed to share triumph with his great friend. “If you want to, you can,” replied the official. There were no more words. Just a look, a smile, then an almighty clap of hands. It was not just an act of sportsmanship. But, in such uncertain times, massage balm for the soul. However, it was so unexpected that not even Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, knew what was going on. “It was a great competition, everybody was focused on it,” says Coe, who was sitting with IOC vice president John Coates, and the heads of cycling, rowing and gymnastics. “But when suddenly Barshim and Tamberi embraced, everyone started looking at me.” They wanted an explanation as to what had just happened. But Coe didn’t have one. “I was thinking, ‘Guys, what the hell is going on here? Oh my God, they’re going to share the medal,’” Coe tells the Guardian. “And then John said to me, ‘So what’s happening?’ “Well, they’ve obviously come to an arrangement,” Coe replied. Coates’ look said it all. “You’ve let the athletes decide that?” Eventually Abby Hoffman, a member of World Athletics’ executive board, found a rule allowing shared medals had passed at the 2011 congress in Daegu. “I didn’t remember it at all,” admits Coe. “And I suddenly thought, ‘I bet that went through in a raft of amendments just 15 minutes before lunch’.” After watching Tamberi and Barshim celebrate, Coe went to bed unsure what the fallout would be. “I thought I’d wake up in the morning to all sorts of negative headlines,” he admits. “But as I tried to sleep I was listening to Radio 4 and they kept saying it was the most uplifting story of the Games and surely worthy of the Fair Play award. By the time the broadcast was over, Barshim and Tamberi were getting a Nobel peace prize.” There are some who will say that Olympic competition should be about winning and nothing else. But the world of elite sport, which is usually so binary, this was a delightfully non-binary act. And the fact that both men also had shared pain – and rebirth – together only made it resonate deeper. Tamberi had been one of the favourites for the 2016 Olympics only to rupture the ligaments of his left ankle 20 days before Rio while attempting a personal best of 2.41m in Monaco. It was so serious that he had to be carted off on a stretcher. Many times he feared he would never be as good again. Barshim always reassured him he would. “I didn’t want him to be in the silver medal position,” the Qatari explained afterwards. “Because I knew what he had been through physically and mentally.” The injury left such a mark that Tamberi even brought the cast he wore after his 2016 ligament surgery with him to the 2020 Games. On it he wrote: ‘My road to Tokyo’. Incredibly, in 2018, when Barshim suffered exactly the same injury while attempting to break the world record of 2.46m and was out for a year, Tamberi repaid the favour by keeping his spirits up. “I’ve been at his wedding,” explained the Italian. “It’s not just two opponents. It is two friends who can share the best moment of their life together and I think it is magical to have done it. We were good friends before the Olympics. But now it’s like we are blood brothers.” “I will never regret this choice,” he added. “This year they changed the Olympic motto, Higher, Faster, Stronger, Together. They added this new word, Together, after so many years. We just followed the motto.” Barshim concurs. He remembers that when he got back to the Olympic village he couldn’t sleep and so he went for a walk. “Literally we were being stopped by every single person we passed,” he says. “The reaction was insane. I love that we did something that touched everybody’s heart.” That is something Coe, a ruthless competitor in his time, also now acknowledges. “Sometimes those of us in sport are too close, while the outside world has a different perspective,” he says. “And they just thought it was a great piece of humanity. Two athletes from very different backgrounds and very different continents, grasping each other, smiling, and sharing this wonderful moment.”",Sport/Sport,Jaw-dropping sport moments of 2021: high jumpers share Olympic gold,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/27/jaw-dropping-sport-moments-of-2021-high-jumpers-share-olympic-gold
12/27/2021,"If the NFL was hoping to keep more teams in the playoff hunt longer by expanding the regular season from 17 weeks to 18, well, mission accomplished. Week 16’s slate of games is nearly completed, yet much remains unsettled, particularly in the still wide-open AFC. If there’s one team that’s taken advantage of their situation, it would be the Kansas City Chiefs, who are currently the only team in the conference guaranteed a playoff spot.  It feels like ages ago, but it was only late October when the preseason favorites looked to be in serious trouble. After a demoralizing 27-3 loss to the Tennessee Titans, the Chiefs had stumbled from the gate with a perplexing 3-4 record. Since then, however, they have rattled off eight straight victories and look to be in great shape to make their third straight Super Bowl. While previous Chiefs teams were famous for outscoring opponents, this Kansas City team has found a more sustainable model of success, as their Patrick Mahomes-driven offense is now balanced by what has become one of the league’s best defenses. It’s to the point, where the Chiefs easily handled the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday despite being without all-world tight end Travis Kelce, who was on the team’s Covid-19 list. With Sunday’s 36-10 victory over the Steelers, Kansas City became the first team in the AFC to clinch their division, partly thanks to the New England Patriots’ own reversal of fortune over in the East. On top of that, they are one game ahead of the Tennessee Titans for the conference’s top seed. Coincidentally enough, the Chiefs’ Super Bowl LV opponents also clinched their division on Sunday. The 11-4 Tampa Bay Buccaneers have won the NFC South for the first time since 2007. Even before the season began, it felt like a rematch between these two squads was potentially in the cards and it hasn’t looked more possible than it does now. However, given how relatively competitive the NFC has been this year, the Chiefs have a clearer path to a championship than the Bucs. Tampa Bay’s record looks sterling, but they are missing key elements of their offense: running back Leonard Fournette and wide receiver Mike Evans both suffered hamstring strains while receiver Chris Godwin is out for the foreseeable future thanks to a torn ACL. On top of this. linebacker Shaq Barrett strained his MCL during Sunday’s win over the Carolina Panthers. Meanwhile, their competition looms. Despite his recent heel turn, reigning MVP Aaron Rodgers hasn’t forgotten how to play football: he has helped lead the 12-3 Green Bay Packers to the best record in the league. The Los Angeles Rams and the Dallas Cowboys – both of whom also clinched a playoff berth on Sunday – have identical 11-4 records, and LA holds a tiebreaker over Tampa Bay. Meanwhile, right now, the Chiefs are the only AFC team that knows its season will last beyond Week 18. These are, however, only regular-season records. While rewards like a bye week and home-field advantage provide huge dividends come the playoffs, they don’t guarantee anything in a single-game elimination format. Look at the defending world champions, who came into last postseason as a wild-card team and still went on to finagle a victory over extremely talented opponents. This brings us back to the chaos of the 2021 NFL season. At no point has a team looked invulnerable and – with the obvious exception of the season’s bottom-feeders (the Detroit Lions and the Jacksonville Jaguars) – every team has seemed capable of putting together a winning streak. It hasn’t helped that teams have had to piece together pandemic-ravaged active rosters as they continually lose players to Covid-19 and the surrounding protocols. When the postseason comes, it’s not set in stone that previous results will dictate future success or failure. Right now, the Chiefs looked primed to make their third straight Super Bowl appearance, but if there’s one lesson to take away from this year it’s not to read too much into the current NFL landscape. Maybe things would be better for the Jets if they just played the Jacksonville Jaguars every game. Not only did the much-maligned Zach Wilson go off on a 54-yard touchdown run, but the Jaguars allowed a 102-yard kickoff return to Braxton Berrios. Jets now have a 52-yard TD AND a kickoff return TD of more than 100 yards.Jets have more highlight plays in the first half today than they do in all of their other games combined this season #Jets #Jaguars pic.twitter.com/wFGOt8asFi In any case, it was a rare entertaining win for the Jets, who beat Jacksonville 26-21, which meant it was a day-after-Christmas miracle for the waitress who received Jets tickets from Wilson as a tip. Joe Burrow, QB, Cincinnati Bengals. His 299 passing yards were the most a quarterback picked up in the first half of an NFL game all season. He ended throwing for 525 total yards and four touchdowns, without a single interception. What can you say? The dude really loves playing against the Baltimore Ravens. OK, it didn’t hurt Burrow or his receivers that the Ravens’ defense has been decimated by illness and injuries, but that’s not enough to explain the sophomore signal-caller’s utter dominance. Baltimore’s injuries weren’t just limited to the defensive end of the game, they were without both of its quarterbacks in Lamar Jackson and Taylor Huntley. So, the very well-traveled Josh Johnson ended up starting for Baltimore on Sunday and while he threw two touchdowns himself, it obviously wasn’t enough for the Ravens, who were beaten 41-21. 1940. That was the last time the Pittsburgh Steelers went five straight games without a first-half touchdown. While the Steelers won two of those five games, they are still in great danger of dropping out of the postseason mix after their blowout loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. At this rate, we might see the end of Ben Roethlisberger’s career sooner than we anticipated. “Football aside, sorry, but I’m doing a story about New Year’s resolutions and I was just wondering if you had any you wanted to share with your fans and our readers?” – a reporter to New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick following his team’s 33-21 loss to the Buffalo Bills How do you ask this question with a straightface when the #Patriots just lost a huge divisional game? pic.twitter.com/FirdQr18HU Infamously, Belichick’s professional demeanor is such that when he uncharacteristically issued an apology for his treatment of the media last week, it was a massive local news story. If there ever was not a time to throw up a softball, human interest question to him, it was not after his team’s most unfortunate loss of the regular season. The 9-6 Patriots have now lost their last two games while the Bills have won their last two and – just like that – things are all tied up on the top of the AFC East. If Buffalo win out, they will win the division that New England could have clinched. Given that he just witnessed Josh Allen absolutely slice through the vaunted Patriots defense, it’s understandable that the coach replied “not right now”. When it comes to football, the entire team’s resolution should be not to fall out of the wild-card standings. In any case, all of this is good news for the 7-7 Miami Dolphins, whose playoff hopes remain alive heading into Monday night’s game against the New Orleans Saints.  The NFL attempted to crowd into the NBA’s gimmick by giving us a pair of Christmas Day games. In the first, the Green Bay Packers faced the Cleveland Browns. Cleveland QB Baker Mayfield threw three interceptions in the first half, each one of which eventually resulted in an Aaron Rodgers touchdown. The Browns made a solid comeback attempt but the game essentially ended on – what else? – a fourth Mayfield interception. The Packers won 24-22 while the Browns are forced to spend another week speculating about Mayfield’s near and long-term future with the franchise.  On Saturday’s second game, the Arizona Cardinals continued their inexplicable late-season slide, falling to the Indianapolis Colts 22-16. In the game, running back Jonathan Taylor failed to record a touchdown but he continued his own MVP campaign by putting together a 108-yard rushing performance in front of a depleted offensive line.  The Detroit Lions kept their losing ways alive with a 20-16 loss to the Atlanta Falcons that dropped their record to 2-12-1. Comically, that one tie continues to be their undoing in their quest for the number one pick in next year’s draft. The Jacksonville Jaguars’ previously discussed loss to the New York Jets dropped their record to 2-13, the league’s overall worst.  The quarterback cavalcade continues in Carolina as Sam Darnold has returned to replace fan favorite Cam Newton, who once again struggled after making an impressive season debut. Instead of picking one, Panthers head coach Matt Rhule decided instead to rotate the pair depending on the in-game situation. As noted earlier, this time around it resulted in a 32-6 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Rhule’s sticking with his platoon strategy, however. “I believe it’s 1000% working,” a defiant Rhule said after the game, “I just know nobody can see it and I apologize. As I tell our team all the time, it took Jay Z seven years.” Jay Z was unavailable for comment.  With their 30-23 win over the Minnesota Vikings, the 11-4 Los Angeles Rams secured a playoff berth despite three interceptions from quarterback Matthew Stafford. As Baker Mayfield could tell you, it’s the fourth INT that really puts a nail in your team’s coffin.",Sport/Sport,This chaotic NFL season augurs the most wide-open playoffs in years,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/27/nfl-playoffs-unpredictable-chaos-chiefs-buccaneers
