12/18/2021,"A state representative was accused Friday in a grand jury indictment of misusing his power to change the law so his wife could become a tag agent. Rep. Terry O'Donnell is charged in the indictment with five felonies and three misdemeanors. ""He denies any wrongdoing,"" his attorney, Mack Martin, said. His wife, Teresa O'Donnell, faces three felonies and one misdemeanor. The most severe offense, conspiracy against the state, has a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine. An Oklahoma County grand jury returned the indictment Friday. O'Donnell introduced a bill in 2019 that allowed spouses of legislators to serve as tag agents. The Oklahoma Tax Commission appointed O'Donnell's wife to take over the Catoosa Tag Agency on Aug. 1, 2019, three months after Gov. Kevin Stitt signed the bill into law. Terry O'Donnell, R-Catoosa, told The Oklahoman last year he did not do anything wrong or inappropriate. He said his wife had no intention of becoming a tag agent when he ran ""this piece of legislation."" He said she sought the appointment after her mother died unexpectedly from pancreatic cancer. Her mother, Georgia McAfee, had been in charge of the Catoosa Tag Agency for more than 40 years. Teresa O'Donnell had worked there for more than four years before her appointment. Grand jurors alleged the two lied to the Oklahoma Tax Commission on her application. They told commissioners she managed the daily operation of the office and supervised four clerks when she actually was only a part-time worker with no supervisory authority, grand jurors alleged.

12/18/2021,"FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) — Police in Virginia say the discovery of four bodies at two different locations in the state are the work of a serial killer who used a shopping cart to transport his victims' bodies after meeting them on dating sites. At a press conference Friday, Fairfax County Police Chief Kevin Davis dubbed the suspect, 35-year-old Anthony Robinson of Washington, D.C., the “shopping cart killer” and said police are working to determine if there are other victims. Davis said Robinson, who was taken into custody in Rockingham County last month, has lived in multiple locations, including New York and Maryland, in recent years. Police in Harrisonburg arrested Robinson last month and charged him with two counts of murder after finding two bodies in a vacant lot in the city. “The good thing is he’s in custody. The challenge that remains is identifying other victims,” Davis said. Evidence uncovered after Robinson's arrest led police to search an area near the Moon Inn in Fairfax County south of Alexandria. During the search, detectives noticed a shopping cart and recalled that a cart had been used to transport the bodies in the Harrisonburg cases, said Ed O'Carroll, commander of the major crimes unit in Fairfax County. Near the shopping cart was a large plastic container that held the remains of two women. One has been tentatively identified as Cheyenne Brown, 29, whose disappearance had been under investigation by Washington, D.C., police. The second body found in Fairfax County has not yet been identified. The three victims who have been identified all went missing in the last few months. Police say they are trying to research Robinson's life going back many years to see if there might be more victims. “That’s what worries us,” Davis said. “He didn’t suddenly turn into who he is three months ago.” Harrisonburg Police Chief Kelley Warner said Robinson has not given police any kind of cooperative statement since his arrest. Police arrested him relatively quickly after the bodies in Harrisonburg were found, based on video surveillance and cellphone records, Warner said. Robinson's lawyer, Louis Nagy, declined to comment on the substance of the charges against his client in Harrisonburg. Robinson has not yet been formally charged in Fairfax County, but police said charges are forthcoming. All three victims who have been identified met Robinson through dating websites. Police believe his dating history may provide clues into any additional victims. Police did not say whether the victims were sexually assaulted, but Davis stated bluntly during the press conference that the suspect did “unspeakable things with his victims.” The two victims who were found dead in Harrisonburg were previously identified as Tonita Lorice Smith, 39, of Charlottesville, and Allene Elizabeth “Beth” Redmon, 54, of Harrisonburg.
