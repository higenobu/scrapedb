The act banned imports from the region it can be proven forced labor was not used in their production. Following the recent opening of a Tesla store in Xinjiang, China, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday that private sector companies that fail to address forced labor and human rights abuses within their supply chains face ""serious legal, reputational, and customer risk,"" both internationally and in the US. An estimated 1 million Uighur Muslims have been detained in ""re-education"" camps and subjected to human rights abuses by Chinese authorities, according to Human Rights Watch. Escapees from the camps have given detailed accounts about the abuses they endured in the camps, including beatings, forced labor, medical experiments, and forced abortions. China has denied all allegations of abuse against the Uighur population. In late December, President Joe Biden signed the Uighur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which banned imports from China's Xinjiang region unless companies can prove that they were not produced using forced labor. Several companies lobbied to weaken the bill, including Apple, Coca-Cola, and Nike, The New York Times reported. ""I can't speak to the specific situation of one company, but as a general matter, we believe the private sector should oppose the PRC's human rights abuses and genocide in Xinjiang,"" Psaki said, when asked specifically about Tesla.

1/5/2022,"An entire fire department in Washington resigned at the beginning of the year after citing numerous complaints toward their city’s mayor. The 12 members of the Cosmopolis Volunteer Fire Association will no longer serve the Cosmopolis community after they put in their resignations starting Jan. 1, according to a statement posted on Facebook. The volunteer fire department served the small city of more than 1,600 people for 127 years. It’s about 50 miles west of Olympia. But conflict with Mayor Kyle Pauley will end the group’s more than century-long protection of the community. The group outlined a list of issues it’s accusing the city of, including: ▪ Leaving the firefighters without death and injury protection. ▪ Failing to repair a firetruck promptly. ▪ Not paying for a volunteer’s medical bill. ▪ Denying requests for material orders to recruit and retain an already stretched-thin team. “Your firefighters in no way want to leave this community unprotected, we are citizens ourselves with families and homes that need emergency medical and fire protection if those (unforeseen) circumstances arise, however we cannot protect you while keeping ourselves safe in the current state Mayor Pauley and his colleagues have created,” the department wrote in a news release on Dec. 23. In response to the mass resignation, Pauley issued a month-long emergency declaration on Jan. 1. Pauley also released a statement calling the department’s complaints “inaccurate and libelous.” He explained the city’s failure to pay for death and injury protection was a result of paperwork not being given to City Hall. He said the issue was “remedied” after it was “brought forward.” And he cited the COVID-19 pandemic for the loss in funding, which caused budget cuts to departments across the city, including the fire department. He said these cuts had an impact on printing recruitment materials. He said the fire department’s budget has been restored to a “pre-pandemic level.” Pauley said any volunteer can return to the department if they would like to. In the meantime, the mayor is working with other local departments to protect the Cosmopolis community.
