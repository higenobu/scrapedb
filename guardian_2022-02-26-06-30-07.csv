2/26/2022,"Concerns are mounting about the safety of Ukraine’s 15 nuclear reactors and the possibility of an ecological disaster in the midst of the Russian invasion. Experts said that those reactors, at four power plants around the country, had layers of safeguards to prevent a catastrophic meltdown of their cores, but in a full scale war of the kind Vladimir Putin has unleashed, there was a heightened risk of those safety layers all failing at once. Radiation spikes were reported on Friday from Chernobyl, the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster which has been overrun by Russian forces. The remains of the reactor core are buried under concrete and the plant is also a storage facility for spent nuclear fuel. The Ukrainian ambassador to Washington Oksana Markarova said that responsibility for the plant, spelt Chornobyl in Ukrainian, now rested with Russia as strict regulations for the plant were not being observed. She accused the Russian forces of holding 92 plant personnel as hostages. Ukraine’s regulatory authority attributed the radiation spikes to military vehicles churning up top soil that is still contaminated by the 1986 reactor explosion. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the readings from Chernobyl remained low and did not pose a danger to the public, but added that the agency was closely monitoring Ukraine’s reactors. It said the IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi “remained gravely concerned”. Six of Ukraine’s reactors are at a nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia, the second biggest in Europe, which is close to where the Russians deployed thousands of troops in amphibious landings on Friday. Up to now the Ukrainian nuclear regulator had assured the IAEA that all its reactors were working safely. However, the Russian advance from the south was fast approaching the area. While a direct strike on the plant remains a remote possibility, experts warn that a disaster could be caused if staff were abruptly prevented from reaching the facility or if there was a sustained interruption in the power supply required to keep the fuel rods continuously cooled. Nuclear power plants use diesel generators as a backup, but those rely on the supply of fuel, which could be severely limited in the midst of a war. “There are contingencies but I doubt that these power plants have prepared for a full-scale invasion,” said Mariana Budjeryn, a Ukrainian research associate with Harvard University’s project on managing the atom. “In the middle of a large scale conflict, there’s a myriad of things that could happen, for which normal, even very robust, safety procedures at a nuclear power plant [would be insufficient].” The alleged taking of staff as hostages in Chernobyl highlighted the dangers to functioning reactors where operators were essential to shutting them down and keeping them cooled. “There are various different challenges from a staffing perspective. Firstly, can the staff actually get into work without being killed?” said James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He added that reserves of diesel for emergency generators became a critical issue in the midst of a war. “Even if you’ve turned the reactor off, you still have a bunch of intensely radioactive fuel that’s generating heat in the core, and so it needs cooling continuously,” Acton said. “Without a grid connection, you’re reliant on whatever fuel or energy you have stored on site, and that is a finite quantity.”",News/World news,Fears mount for safety of Ukraine’s nuclear reactors amid Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/nuclear-meltdown-threat-ukraine-russia-attack
2/26/2022,"A former MP and investigative journalist has refused to divulge the sources of his information about the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings in a hearing at the Old Bailey. Chris Mullin, 74, is challenging an application by West Midlands police to require him to disclose source material dating back to his investigation in 1985 and 1986. Mullin has refused to divulge the information that would reveal the identity of the man who confessed his role in the bombings to him in an interview years ago, in the action brought under the Terrorism Act of 2000. He said that if the application were to succeed it would “set a precedent which could be used to undermine the freedom of journalists to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice and other matters in cases involving terrorism”. “This is a unique and deeply concerning case, especially to anyone who cares about public interest investigative journalism in this country,” Gavin Millar QC, for Mullin, told the recorder of London, Mark Lucraft. “After the Birmingham pub bombs my client tracked down and interviewed a person who was prepared to own up in detail to having planted the bombs. The person did so reluctantly, not to promote terrorism or proclaim their role in the bombings but so that Chris Mullin could show that the Birmingham Six were – as the whole world subsequently came to know – innocent. “Now the state – in the form of the West Midlands police, the very force that was responsible for failing to investigate the bombings properly at the time and instead framed six innocent men – seeks an order under the Terrorism Act forcing him to hand over documents in his possession to enable them to identify the person he interviewed.” Earlier, James Lewis QC, for West Midlands police, told the hearing that one of the men responsible for the bombings, only described in court as AB, in which 21 people died and more than 200 were injured, had made a “voluntary, reliable confession” to Mullin. “The real perpetrators have never been brought to justice,” said Lewis. Now the West Midlands police were reinvestigating the case and relatives of those killed in the bombing were “campaigning for justice for their loved ones”. He argued that there was a “strong and compelling public interest” in the court making a disclosure order because of the gravity of the case. Mullin has declined to provide data, including unredacted notes and notebooks, because the information was given on the understanding that he would never reveal his source. Mullin said in his statement that “I hold no brief for the terrorists responsible for this atrocity … I have every sympathy with those whose loved ones died and were I in their place I, too, would want those responsible to face justice.” He added that “it must be said that at the time [when he published his initial findings], the West Midlands police were completely uninterested in pursuing any such line of inquiry. This would have required them to acknowledge that they had framed six innocent men … I believe my actions were overwhelmingly in the public interest.” The court heard that Mullin had written an article in which he stated that “I know the names of the bombers … I will never name him.” Mullin briefly responded to questions in court from Lewis about the identity of his sources by responding twice: “I am not prepared to say.” A decision on the seeking of disclosure was reserved.",News/UK news,Journalist refuses to disclose source material in 1974 Birmingham pub bombings,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/25/journalist-refuses-to-disclose-source-material-in-1974-birmingham-pub-bombings

2/26/2022,"Mission accomplished. Gather up the buffet. Pack away the trinkets. Shred the manual of state-approved menacing platitudes. Sport has served its purpose here. And whatever it might choose to do from this point, all that really seems certain is that Vladimir Putin will not be listening. Thank you, Fifa, Uefa, the IOC and our many commercial partners, for your invaluable help with the messaging. That is a wrap. It is hard to know what to do with the news that Uefa plans to move the Champions League final from St Petersburg, Putin’s home town, as an act of censure for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This is of course a necessary step, not least for security reasons, and beyond that for Uefa’s own troubled optics. But the relocation of a final, as the bullets fly in Kyiv, is also a study in pointlessness. From here Uefa’s act of reputation management can only have any worth if all of us, from spineless governing bodies, to useful idiots of the media (present), to consumers everywhere, are willing to learn a very hard and very modern lesson. The only dissenting voice at Fifa’s special committee meeting on Friday is likely to have been Alexander Dyukov, president of the Russian FA and chairman of the board at Gazprom, although even he is unlikely to care too much at this late stage. Schalke can remove the Gazprom logo from its shirts. Uefa can reconsider its sponsorship deal with the Russian state gas provider. But the day has already moved on. The sportswashing has happened. Commerce, politics and televised sporting entertainment have served their purpose. Putin’s Russia has gained influence, soft power, and legitimacy. The home public has been placated. Sochi and Moscow have been used to dole out favours to Putin’s loyal lieutenants. We are at a stage where taking the Champions League final away is like relying on a pointed clearing of the throat to deter the gang of masked men halfway up the stairs, coshes in hand. Putin is already raining death down on the people of Ukraine. He doesn’t care, at this stage, exactly where the football’s going to be played. If sport can take anything from this horror it is that we now know beyond any doubt that this is all for real. That those who talk – so tiresomely: the game’s on! – about dictatorships and human rights are speaking from a place of real consequences. That state of complicity starts, of course, at football’s utterly shameless Swiss headquarters. Gianni Infantino has already made his own oleaginous public statement, deploring violence generally without actually mentioning the word Russia or the name Vladimir Putin. “We woke up and we were shocked by what we saw,” Infantino crocodiled, maintaining an expression of textureless neutrality. History will judge Infantino in the full glare of all his actions, his sycophancy, his cosying up to bloodstained despots. Rewind three and a half years and Infantino was at the Kremlin declaring that the world was now “in love” with Russia, and clasping Putin to his breast like a brother (also present at that meeting, in an odd twist, were Rio Ferdinand and Peter Schmeichel). A year later Fifa’s president was back for the presentation of a Russian state medal. “You welcomed the world as friends,” Infantino told the same President Putin who is currently deploying the largest European land force since the second world war in a bloody and illegal invasion. “The world has created bonds of friendship with Russia that will last forever.” Infantino may have shown himself to be a grotesque, morally invertebrate fool. But that lesson extends to almost all of us on some level: a lesson in something very hard and very cold, in a process that was initially obscure in its endpoint. Amnesty International was among those to introduce the phrase “sportswashing” four years ago. An article on this page in 2018 about Abu Dhabi, Manchester City and the Matthew Hedges affair used the word in inverted commas, and took time to explain where it came from. At times it has looked like a diffuse, insidious propaganda programme. But there is no way now of hiding from the truth of where it can lead, a process in which many of us are co-opted to some degree. After Russia’s World Cup I wrote a book about travelling around the country, still high on the show and the interactions with everyday Russians, and hopeful there might actually be something in that connection, some kind of slow-burn glasnost. But guess what? Vladimir Putin really is a murderous imperialist dictator and the World Cup was a part of his machinery for power. The book feels like a kind of kompromat. And Russia has been brilliantly effective at this on so many levels. Four years ago there were calls in the House of Commons for a World Cup boycott after the Salisbury poisonings. But even then it was hard to see what tangible effect this might have while Russian money and influence continued to sluice through the UK economy, legal system and politics. In her book Putin’s People Catherine Belton writes of London’s financial and political centres rolling over in the face of Russian cash back in the mid-2000s when the capital became known as “Moscow-on-Thames”, the years of yachts and planes, peers on the company roll, the Heathrow “school bus” shuttle back home for the weekly boarding school set. “By the mid 2000s London had gained a reputation as the world’s laundromat, washing hundreds of billions of pounds of dirty money,” Belton writes. “The way had been opened for the KGB to create a vast web of black cash, far larger and more sophisticated than the networks it had installed for black ops and influence peddling in the battle for empire of Soviet days.” A Russian tycoon is quoted as saying: “In London, money rules everything. Anyone and anything can be bought. The Russians came to London to corrupt the UK political elite.” Is this true? If so, how true? The fact those in power in Moscow believe it to be so is probably enough for a start. And yes, sport is simply small beer in this, with a habit of hugely overstating its role in world events. But such is its propaganda value we do tend to get a front-row seat, and to accept it rather guilelessly. I was there at Fifa House in Zurich in 2010 when Putin emerged, a little startlingly, from the back of the press conference hall to take questions after Russia’s successful World Cup bid: a small, ambling man, alone on that large stage, shrugging and looking bored, but radiating a weirdly compelling personal power. It was almost comical, and certainly unnerving. But there can be no false innocence from here, no hope against hope, fingers crossed, for something real behind the platitudes. Ukraine has called for Russian clubs to be expelled from Uefa competitions and this should happen immediately, not just as a punishment but because the spectacle is repulsive and unsustainable in the shadow of war. And from here on in we have been warned. We know, beyond any shadow of doubt, where this stage-management can lead. We know Vlad will not be returning Gianni’s calls, his anxious voicemails. That game has run its course. We have already been played.",Sport/Football,Uefa and Fifa are too late: Russia’s sportswashing has served its purpose | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/uefa-and-fifa-are-too-late-russias-sportswashing-has-served-its-purpose
2/26/2022,"One day England will play Wales at Twickenham without a full-blown global crisis gathering momentum. Two years ago the Covid-19 curtain was on the verge of crashing down, and this week’s grim events in Ukraine have put the travails of sport into similarly sharp perspective. Even on the biggest days there are more important outcomes in life than the result of a rugby game. However, once the last notes of the anthems have floated upwards and a minute’s applause has been conducted in memory of Evesham RFC’s Jack Jeffery, who died recently while playing in a club match, there will be a brief opportunity for temporary escapism. The nerves and pent-up emotions felt by all players have to be funnelled somewhere. The question, as ever, is which of the two teams can best handle the pressure and thrive on it. As recently as Thursday afternoon England were looking as well placed in that regard as at any time since the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Then came the familiar twang of a Manu Tuilagi hamstring, such a fundamental element of Eddie Jones’s red rose orchestra. The predominant sound now is the gnashing of teeth in the Manchester area, Sale having once again seen their man crocked in England’s care. If this latest setback does not entirely tilt the playing field it is the most unfortunate Twickenham timing since a positive Covid test sidelined England’s then-captain Owen Farrell before the autumn internationals. Should one man(u) make such a difference to a squad’s collective psyche? Of course not, but for a variety of reasons England are struggling to wean themselves off their longtime Tuilagi dependency. Partly that is because there is no like-for-like replacement and partly because, deep down, they know the 30-year-old is a one-off. At some point, though, the irregular sugar rush of having Manu back in midfield needs to be replaced by something more sustainable and more consistently reliable. Is there another team in the world whose self-belief is so reliant on one individual? As it happens the nearest challenger is probably Wales and their injured captain Alun Wyn Jones, who is missing a Six Nations game against England for the first time in 15 years. In his absence against Scotland, though, Wales carved out the grittiest of wins, shaped precisely in the Lions skipper’s image. Now it is England’s turn to fill their crater-sized midfield hole with something equally wholesome. Leaving aside the table and the necessity for both teams to win if they wish to claim this season’s title, this is a significant contest for numerous reasons. Wales may be underdogs but if they lose as badly as they did in Ireland then last year’s champions will be back at square one, fiercely debating the regional and club issues which, longer-term, clearly need addressing. Another character-laden victory, on the other hand, would speak volumes for the spirit of Wayne Pivac’s squad. It would also deflate the “New England” balloon, just as Scotland did at Murrayfield in the opening round. Having trailed in fifth last season, England would be left staring at another bottom-half finish unless they contrive to upset Ireland and France in their remaining fixtures. Barring something spectacular, though, it really should be England’s day even with Tuilagi missing. The return of their chilled-out captain Courtney Lawes always puts his side more at ease and Marcus Smith, as he showed against South Africa in November, loves a full house at Twickenham. The hosts are also hoping to enjoy more luck from the match officials than in Cardiff a year ago when Wales’s 40-24 win was not without its controversial refereeing calls. There was also the 33-30 game at Twickenham in 2020 when the late red card shown to Tuilagi by the New Zealander Ben O’Keeffe prompted Jones to suggest England had been pitted against “16 men.” The real common denominator, though, has been Wales’s resourcefulness and a white-shirted tendency to blow hot and cold. England, as we keep saying, have the individual talent. They just need to plug it all into the mains and let properly rip. Manage that and it could turn into a tough gig for Wales. A packed Twickenham crowd, including the sides’ respective patrons the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, could do with a little joy and England, in particular, have it in them to raise the roof. Much attention, rightly, has been focused on the roadrunner-paced zip factor of Harry Randall and the artful dodging of Smith but, without Tuilagi, the home side will initially look to Ellis Genge, Luke Cowan-Dickie and Kyle Sinckler to carry hard and establish the quick ruck speed so crucial to English attacking ambitions. If, on the other hand, the game develops into a stop-start affair it could just favour Wales’s infield kicking game and the combative visiting back-row, bolstered further by the return of Taulupe Faletau, who has a history of discomfiting England. Alex Cuthbert is winning his 50th cap, while Dan Biggar, Tomas Francis and Nick Tompkins can all be relied upon for cussed resistance. The tendency of sides to raise their games against England is also older than Twickenham itself, as the home forwards coach Richard Cockerill is well aware. The last time the Leicester and England hooker was involved in a championship fixture against Wales was in 1999 when Scott Gibbs’s late try wrecked English grand slam ambitions. “As an Englishman you get used to everyone not liking you as much as you would like them to,” said Cockerill after England had concluded their final training session. His nation’s motivation for a home win, though, has been deepened by a desire to celebrate two of their more popular squad members. Sinckler, who has not always had the easiest ride against Wales, will be winning a 50th Test cap, while Ben Youngs will come off the bench at some point for his 115th appearance to eclipse Jason Leonard as the most capped Englishman of all time. Youngs still has a way to go to overtake the great Rocky Clark, who played 137 times for England’s women’s side, but no one amasses such a teetering stack of caps by accident. And if his teammates can start quickly, despite Tuilagi’s absence, the game of his life could be all but settled before he even jogs on.",Sport/Sport,‘New England’ searching for self-belief in Six Nations crunch with Wales | Robert Kitson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/25/england-wales-six-nations-preview-twickenham
