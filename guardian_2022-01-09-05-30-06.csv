1/9/2022,"Andros Townsend’s long-range strike proved to be the difference as Everton needed extra-time to finally see off a spirited effort from Championship side Hull City to progress to the fourth round of the FA Cup. Whether it was enough to ease the growing pressure surrounding Rafa Benítez is another matter after another worrying performance from the Toffees, this time against lower league opposition. Having fallen behind within a minute here courtesy of Tyler Smith’s header, Everton responded well and led by half-time after strikes from Demarai Gray and André Gomes, the latter scoring his first goal in almost three years. A litany of further chances came and went for the visitors without any being converted though, and when Ryan Longman’s stunning finish took the tie to extra-time, the prospect of an upset was firmly on the cards. However, as he and Gray have done so many times already this season, Townsend spared Everton’s blushes with a trademark long-range strike in extra-time to safely book their passage into the next round.  If there was tension from the travelling support towards Benítez before kick-off, it intensified inside a chaotic opening minute, when the Premier League team fell behind. After losing the ball almost immediately upon kicking off and then conceding a free-kick, Everton’s frailties at set-pieces came back to haunt them when George Honeyman’s delivery was met by an unmarked Smith, who headed past Asmir Begovic. The reaction from the Everton support was more vociferous than that of the players, who almost fell two goals behind when Tom Eaves’ header was turned over the bar by Begovic. Eaves then fired another goalbound effort straight at Begovic – it was the Premier League side who appeared in danger of being put out of the tie before it had even begun to settle as a contest. However as the half wore on Everton weathered the storm and grew into the game. They finally equalised at the midway point of the half when Anthony Gordon and Gray combined to put the latter through on goal. Gray calmly slid the ball past Nathan Baxter and suddenly the momentum was with Everton. All their best work was coming via Gordon and Gray. After the latter’s equaliser Gordon struck the base of Baxter’s post two minutes later after another fine run into the Hull box. Michael Keane then forced a smart save from Baxter after a marauding run from inside his own half. As half-time approached it felt inevitable that Everton would take the lead. They did so on the half-hour when a pinpoint cross from Jonjoe Kenny was converted by André Gomes, whose header was too strong for Baxter. Everton had started the match in decidedly lacklustre fashion but by the time the interval arrived they deserved their lead. The momentum stayed with the visitors after half-time and, just as in the first half, it was Gordon and Gray driving matters. The first real chance of the half came when Gordon was played through by Gray, but he could only shoot straight at Baxter, who was fast becoming the only thing keeping the hosts in the game. The visitors continued to assert their dominance heading into the final half-hour. Vitaliy Mykolenko should have marked his debut with a goal after a well-worked corner fell at the feet of the Ukrainian, but he could only fire over the goal from six yards out. By now, the tie should have been over, but it wasn’t, and Everton’s profligacy came back to haunt them with 20 minutes remaining. As Benítez’s side laboured on the edge of their area, a magnificent effort from substitute Longman curled past Begovic to make it 2-2 and put the game in the balance once again. Now it was Hull who now looked the more likely to win the game in normal time. A wonderful run from Keane Lewis-Potter led to the forward unleashing a shot that beat Begovic, but flashed wide. Following Longman’s equaliser, it was Hull who had the better of the chances in the final minutes of normal time, with Keane Lewis-Potter hitting the post. However, extra-time was a different matter and midway through the first half, Townsend delivered with a long-range effort that had enough bend and dip to catch Baxter off-guard and put Everton through.",Sport/Football,Andros Townsend’s long-range strike takes Everton past Hull in extra-time,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/08/hull-everton-fa-cup-match-report
1/9/2022,"Back behind closed doors, every yelp from Ralph Hasenhüttl’s mouth was loud and clear but after his team triumphed from a chaotic extra-time period in which there were three goals in eight minutes it was also possible to hear a collective sigh of relief from the Southampton dugout after they managed to reach the FA Cup fourth round despite playing with 10 men for more than 90 minutes. Swansea seized the lead for the first time four minutes into extra time but led for all of 58 seconds, Mohamed Elyounoussi converting from close range before another Southampton substitute, Shane Long, struck an easy winner. It was a painful goal from a Swansea perspective but they would have been fortunate to prosper, only forcing the game to be prolonged when Joel Piroe cancelled out Nathan Redmond’s opener with their first meaningful foray into the Southampton box with 13 minutes left of normal time.  Hasenhüttl named a strong team and perhaps it was just as well he did given Southampton ended up being a man down for so long. For the first 29 minutes, this was no contest but then Yann Valery, already booked for a crude challenge on Ryan Manning, reached to put his left hand on the right shoulder of Michael Obafemi as the former Southampton striker began to stretch his legs after latching on to a crossfield pass. The referee, Simon Hooper, was quick to brandish a red card. Liam Cullen switched play from right to left with a troublesome diagonal pass and Valery found himself on the wrong side and lost under the flight of the ball. Valery made little contact but it was sufficient to send Obafemi thudding to the turf. Until then Swansea were overwhelmed by Southampton’s fluidity, particularly the speed of Nathan Tella, who has signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract, and often outwitted by the vision of James Ward-Prowse. Russell Martin has unashamedly committed to a passing style of play that is easy on the eye but Liam Walsh was guilty of picking the wrong option when Tella intercepted his sloppy ball across the face of goal and the forward proceeded to slip in Redmond, who coolly fired in his shot from the edge of the box. In a virtually empty stadium, Swansea struggled to get into their stride. Martin encouraged his side to drive forward but they spent the majority of the first half heading in the opposite direction. The Swansea striker Piroe, backtracking deep inside his own box, did just enough to deflect Tella’s shot wide after Tella picked up a dinked free-kick by Ward-Prowse, who again cut oval-shape holes into his socks to aid the circulation in his calves. The Swansea defender Ryan Bennett then made a panicked clearance after Redmond sped past Kyle Naughton following more good work by Tella. Swansea had spurned the opportunity to seize on an earlier Southampton lapse. Cullen seized on Jack Stephens’s stray pass and played in Piroe but the striker failed to control the ball on halfway. Southampton scored eight goals on their last visit to Wales, trouncing Newport in the EFL Cup in August and while repeating that feat was unlikely they appeared to be in cruise control. But the complexion of the game changed when Valery made the lonely walk down the tunnel, refusing to make eye contact with his manager. The full-back’s dismissal gave Swansea a much-needed leg-up and they began to push further forward. Walsh snapped an early shot wide but Forster was not tested in the first half. Swansea saw plenty of the ball but failed to make Southampton fret, with shots on target at a premium, and the visitors should have extended their advantage approaching the hour mark. Walsh clattered into Oriol Romeu almost 25 yards from goal and from the subsequent free-kick Stephens, arriving unmarked at the back post after running off the back of Flynn Downes, somehow contrived to head wide into the side netting from inside the six-yard box. Moments later Martin moved Downes into defence to introduce Olivier Ntcham and the club captain, Matt Grimes, from the bench. Southampton, too, freshened things up, with Ibrahima Diallo and Adam Armstrong replacing Redmond and Stuart Armstrong with 25 minutes to play. Then Swansea pulled level to prolong what was a contest short of quality. Naughton drove into the box and his cutback reached Piroe via the flailing Stephens and the striker made no mistake from inside the area.",Sport/Football,Long sends 10-man Saints through against Swansea after extra-time flurry,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/08/swansea-southampton-fa-cup-match-report
1/9/2022,"For many Kazakhs, the full story behind the unrest of the past week remains as murky as the mist that enveloped Almaty, the country’s largest city and the centre of violence, at the same time. People were unable to access accurate information, as an internet blackout froze almost all access to the outside world during a tragic few days of violence in which military vehicles rolled through the streets, government buildings burned and state television carried rolling threats that “bandits and terrorists” would be eliminated without mercy.  Now both order and the internet have been largely restored, but there are still more questions than answers. One thing that is clear is many of the old assumptions about Kazakhstan, the resource-rich Central Asian state, have been overturned. Just last month the country celebrated the 30th anniversary of its independence, with official speeches highlighting the image of a peaceful, prosperous nation, one that had largely avoided political unrest and boasted an independent and “multivector” foreign policy. Kazakhstan, it seemed, had even successfully managed the tricky transition out of power from its long-standing president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who led the country from independence in 1991 until 2019, to his handpicked successor, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. A month later, and the picture is very different. Peaceful protests turned into violent clashes, Tokayev announced he had ordered security forces to “shoot to kill, without warning”, and troops from a Russia-led military alliance are on the ground after being called for by Tokayev. Amid it all, dozens of deaths and a sense from eyewitness reports that the real number of casualties could be much higher than the 26 “armed criminals” and 18 security officers that the interior ministry has said were killed. More than 4,000 people have been detained. There was a suspicion all week that there may be more in play than a straightforward popular uprising, and this was reinforced by the announcement on Saturday that Karim Masimov, a powerful former security chief and prime minister, had been arrested on suspicion of treason. The move only increased speculation that the initial protests could have been used by groups within the country’s political elite to fight their own battles. A source in Kazakh business circles gave credence to this scenario, describing a situation over recent months of increasing tension between figures close to Nazarbayev and his successor, Tokayev. “In the last six to 12 months there was increased squabbling, which was paralysing decision-making,” said the source. “It has been bubbling for some time.” One of the more surprising episodes of the week was Tokayev’s transformation from placid placeholder to furious autocrat, promising to crush the revolt brutally. “We were dealing with armed and well-prepared bandits, both local and foreign. Bandits and terrorists, who should be destroyed. This will happen in the nearest time,” Tokayev said in an uncompromising address to the nation on Friday, noting that there were 20,000 such “bandits” in Almaty alone. He also posted a message in English on Twitter: “In my basic view, no talks with the terrorists: We must kill them.” It was later deleted. “Before, he came across as a mealy-mouthed quiet diplomat, but the rhetoric we saw on Friday was that of a general leading an army,” said Kate Mallinson, associate fellow at Chatham House. Amnesty International described Tokayev’s promise to shoot without warning as “a recipe for disaster”, and there is now a question of how much the government response will differentiate between peaceful protesters and violent groups. Tokayev put Kazakhstan’s already beleaguered civil society on alert when he said that free media played a role in fanning the unrest. “There is still very little independent information and a lot of uncertainty. However, one thing is clear: the peaceful protest was genuine and spontaneous,” said Diana T Kudaibergenova, a sociologist at Cambridge University. “People went to the streets to voice their grievances and we saw some self-organisation, especially in western Kazakhstan.” The protest began in the west last weekend, sparked by rising fuel prices, and quickly spread to other cities, including Almaty. There, many of those on the streets reported that on Wednesday and Thursday the demonstration was hijacked by violent groups, some of whom appeared to be well organised, and who attacked government buildings and briefly seized the airport. Tokayev, in his address, spoke vaguely about “foreign-trained” attackers, but gave no details and did not specify who they were supposedly working for. Many questions remain about the role of Nazarbayev in the week’s apparent backstage quarrels. Tokayev announced on Wednesday that he was removing Nazarbayev from head of the security council, without stating whether that was with or without the former president’s approval. There were persistent rumours throughout the week that Nazarbayev and his family had fled the country. On Saturday,, Nazarbayev’s spokesperson Aidos Ukibay denounced the rumours as “knowingly false and speculative information”. He said Nazarbayev was in close contact with Tokayev and wanted the nation to rally around the new president. But the man himself has been silent during the most dramatic week in the young country’s history. It was a surprising absence from a politician who has personified Kazakhstan for the past three decades. When he stepped down in 2019, the new capital city he had ordered created in 1997 was renamed Nur-Sultan, in his honour. But for all the excesses of the cult of personality, for a long time Nazarbayev’s Kazakhstan was a much savvier autocracy than those of the other post-Soviet Central Asian nations. Many western diplomats had a positive view of his leadership, despite the democratic shortcomings, in part because of the lucrative opportunities for western businesses the country provided. “He was able to balance Russia and China, and other external influences, and he implemented some genuine reforms,” said a western diplomatic source. At the same time, a small elite close to Nazarbayev became tremendously wealthy, while many ordinary people still lived in poverty. Over time, resentments only intensified. “In Kazakhstan, market economy means capitalism, which means big money, which means large bribes for the best connected,” as a former US ambassador put it in a leaked diplomatic cable from 2010, paraphrasing a conversation with a top Kazakh businessman. Whatever the final outcome of last week’s turmoil, the images of a statue to Nazarbayev in the city of Taldykorgan being pulled down, and of crowds chanting “Old man, out!” are likely to fundamentally alter the legacy he hoped for. Also at stake is the independent foreign policy that was one of his most prized achievements. When, on Wednesday evening, Tokayev called for support from the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), a Russia-led military alliance, the request was approved within hours. At a time when all eyes were on the troops massed close to Russia’s border with Ukraine, suddenly there was a different Russian intervention to contend with. Both the Kazakh and Russian sides have insisted the contingent will be limited in size, scope and duration, and so far, claims of a Russian occupation seem overblown. But even if the troops are gone in a few days, the balance of power in the region is likely to have been altered irrevocably. “Nothing comes for free with Putin, and there will be a quid pro quo,” said Mallinson.As well as geopolitical implications, the sudden collapse of the Kazakh security forces and Nazarbayev’s legacy may also have important repercussions in Russian domestic politics. “Russia and Kazakhstan are two very similar political models: post-imperial resource-based personalised autocracies,” said Moscow-based political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann. The “Nazarbayev option” had been considered as one possible way for Vladimir Putin to step aside safely when his present term ends in 2024, but it now seems a much less appealing option than it might have done a week ago. Those involved in political decision-making in Russia would likely conclude from the recent events in Kazakhstan that even managed transition is dangerous, and that security forces should be further strengthened, said Schulmann. “If you have a pet idea, whatever happens will feed into your pet idea,” she said, noting that the Kremlin is fixated on preserving the current power structures and repelling perceived outside threats through repressing dissent at home. As attention shifts to the behind-the-scenes infighting and the geopolitical implications, some inside the country are urging that the human tragedy of the past days should not be forgotten. On Saturday, a group of Kazakh civil society organisations penned an open letter to the authorities: “Unrest and violence have no place at peaceful demonstrations… We ask the authorities to carry out a full investigation of every part of this tragedy.”",News/World news,"As order is restored in Kazakhstan, its future is murkier than ever",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/08/as-order-is-restored-in-kazakhstan-its-future-is-murkier-than-ever
1/9/2022,"Ministers face claims they have allowed the ruling elite of Kazakhstan to secretly invest vast chunks of the country’s wealth in the London property market after failing to introduce promised new transparency laws. Former prime minister David Cameron pledged at an anti-corruption summit in London in 2016 that the UK would end the secret offshore ownership of property. More than five years later, a proposed register of foreign owners of UK property has still not been introduced.  The uprisings in Kazakhstan last week reflected widespread anger at former president Nursultan Nazarbayev’s three decades of rule and the vast fortunes amassed by a privileged few. Property worth hundreds of millions of pounds in London and southern England has already been identified as bought by Kazakhstan’s wealthy elite in the past two decades. The government is now under pressure to fast-track new laws to introduce the register pledged by Cameron. David Lammy, shadow foreign secretary, said: “The government has abjectly failed to get to grips with the UK’s role in money laundering, corruption and illicit finance. London is the destination of choice for the world’s kleptocrats looking to store ill-gotten wealth. It is no good using tough words against the Putin regime, or criticising Kazakhstan’s human rights record, while being a soft touch for the elites that sustain and profit from autocratic regimes.” There are nearly 90,000 companies in England and Wales owned offshore by companies incorporated in secrecy jurisdictions. A report entitled The UK’s Kleptocracy Problem, published last month by the thinktank Chatham House, identified 34 properties bought by the Kazakh ruling elite from 1998 to 2002 at a cost of about £530m. John Heathershaw, professor of international relations at Exeter University and lead author of the report, said: “Most of the property is linked to Nazarbayev’s family or members of the ruling elite that are close to them.” Experts say the portfolio is likely to be “the tip of the iceberg” because many other properties will be owned by offshore shell companies which do not disclose their beneficial owners. Heathershaw said London was a popular destination for ruling elites with suspicious wealth because it was a global cosmopolitan and financial hub; it provided a range of legal firms offering aggressive reputation management services; and it offered the chance to mix with influential figures in political, royal and business circles. He said: “London has been really important for the political elite in Kazakhstan and that includes the relationships they have developed with individuals such as Tony Blair and Prince Andrew.” Blair provided advice to the Kazakh regime and Prince Andrew has been close to some of its wealthiest individuals. The Kazakh elite’s properties bought during Nazarbayev’s presidency include Prince Andrew’s marital home, Sunninghill Park in Berkshire, bought in 2007 for £15m by oligarch Timur Kulibayev, the son-in-law of the former Kazakhstan president. It also emerged in early 2020 that Nazarbayev’s daughter Dariga Nazarbayeva and grandson Nurali Aliyev own property in London worth at least £80m. The National Crime Agency issued unexplained wealth orders, which are used to track suspicious funds, against three properties: a mansion in The Bishops Avenue, one of the most expensive roads in the capital; an apartment in Chelsea; and a mansion in Highgate, north London. The orders were dismissed by a judge who found the NCA had not proved any link between the purchase of the homes and criminal funds. Oliver Bullough, author of Moneyland, a book which investigates how illicitly gained wealth can be moved around the world, said the uprisings in Kazakhstan were linked to the uninterrupted flow of the country’s wealth into cities such as London. According to a KPMG report, 162 people control about half of Kazakhstan’s total wealth. Bullough said: “Kazakhstan’s elite has been able to extract a vast amount of wealth and leave ordinary people with very little. And the primary enabler of that extraction has been the UK.” Ben Cowdock, investigations lead at Transparency International UK, an independent anti-corruption organisation, said the UK should now be examining if it can impose sanctions on any of the ruling elite in Kazakhstan who may have benefited from illicit funds. He said: “Kazakhstan is a kleptocracy and there are high levels of corruption at the highest echelons of power. The UK should be seeking the evidence to take action, but it’s extremely difficult in a country which has essentially legitimised corruption. They’ve taken control of all the country’s assets and shared them out among the ruling elite.” Nazarbayev’s whereabouts remain unclear this week and there has been speculation he may have left the country. Nazarbayev, 81, stood down as president in 2019, but until last week still wielded considerable power and was chair of the country’s powerful security council. He has now been removed from this post. A UK government spokesperson said: “The government will establish a new beneficial ownership register of overseas entities that own UK property, in order to combat money laundering and achieve greater transparency in the UK property market. It is essential that the register strikes the right balance between improving transparency and minimising burdens on legitimate commercial activity. The government will legislate when parliamentary time allows.”",News/World news,How the Kazakh elite put its wealth into UK property,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/08/how-the-kazakh-elite-put-its-wealth-into-uk-property
1/9/2022,"Covid should now be treated as an endemic virus similar to flu, and ministers should end mass-vaccination after the booster campaign, the former chairman of the UK’s vaccine taskforce has said. With health chiefs and senior Tories also lobbying for a post-pandemic plan for a straining NHS, Dr Clive Dix called for a major rethink of the UK’s Covid strategy, in effect reversing the approach of the last two years and returning to a “new normality”.  “We need to analyse whether we use the current booster campaign to ensure the vulnerable are protected, if this is seen to be necessary,” he said. “Mass population-based vaccination in the UK should now end.” He said that ministers should urgently back research into Covid immunity beyond antibodies to include B-cells and T-cells (white blood cells), which could be used to create vaccines for vulnerable people specific to Covid variants: “We now need to manage disease, not virus spread. So stopping progression to severe disease in vulnerable groups is the future objective.” His intervention comes as it was revealed more than 150,000 people across the UK have now died from Covid. Official figures published yesterday recorded a further 313 deaths, the highest daily number since February last year when the last peak was receding. It takes the total recorded deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test to 150,057. Meanwhile, NHS officials are warning that patient safety has been compromised this winter because of a crippling health and social care staff shortage that requires a million additional workers by the next decade. Writing in the Observer, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said that the pandemic had exposed “its weakest links”. “There is a clear, regrettable, impact on quality of care and, in the most pressured parts of the system, a worrying increase in patient safety risk,” he writes. “It is now very clear that the NHS and our social care system do not have sufficient capacity. That asking staff to work harder and harder to address that gap is simply not sustainable. That we need a long-term, fully funded, workforce plan to attract and retain the extra one million health and care staff the Health Foundation estimates will be needed by 2031.” Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, also called for action: “The pandemic has highlighted workforce pressures but they were never new. We can’t solve them overnight, but we have a moral duty to NHS and care staff to look them in the eye after the hell of the last two years and say a long-term plan is in place.” Hopson said some NHS trusts outside London would see Covid hospitalisations rise even higher than their previous record peak last year. “There are already a number of trusts whose covid hospitalisation levels are at 100% of their January 2021 peak,” he said. “That’s before they are anywhere near their current peaks. These organisations are likely to be 10 days or two weeks away from their peak this time round.” He also said he understood that as many as 40% of care homes had stopped taking new admissions in the last week, making it hard for hospitals to discharge patients. Stephen Chandler, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said that social care was in a “national emergency” because so many staff were off sick. A government spokesperson said “historic amounts of funding” were being provided for NHS backlogs and social care. “Hospital admissions are rising, however this is not yet translating into the same numbers needing intensive care that we saw in previous waves,” they said. “We’re increasing NHS capacity by building onsite Nightingale hubs, as well as creating 2,500 virtual beds where people can be safely treated at home.” Dix’s remarks on ending mass-vaccination come as the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) ruled that fourth doses were not currently needed because most older people who had received boosters were still well-protected against Omicron, three months after the booster campaign began. The UK Health Security Agency said protection for over-65s was about 90%, three months after a booster jab. The JCVI’s deputy chair, Professor Anthony Harnden, said the committee was monitoring the impact of Omicron on older and vulnerable people on a weekly basis. A debate is unfolding over fourth doses. Last week, Israel became the first country to embark on a fourth round of Covid vaccinations, for over-60s and healthcare workers who had their third jab at least three months ago. Greg Clark, the Tory chair of the Commons science and technology committee, said a fourth dose of vaccine should be considered for healthcare workers. “The UK Health Security Agency found that the impact of a third dose against transmission of Covid wanes after 10 weeks,” he said. “So, given the staff shortages in the NHS from self-isolation and the fact that NHS staff received their booster from mid September, it would be worth the JCVI considering whether a further dose would help reduce absences among frontline staff.” Dix was instrumental in helping pharmaceutical firms create the Covid vaccines, which have transformed the risk presented by the virus to most people. He said he supported the current booster campaign, but a “new targeted strategy” was needed to get the UK to a position of “managing Covid” as an endemic virus. “Firstly we should consider when we stop testing and let individuals isolate when they are not well and return to work when they feel ready to do so. In the same way we do in a bad influenza season,” he said. Dix said the government should support research and analysis of how effective vaccines had been at producing “memory B- and T-cell immunity” – parts of the immune system that recognise Covid – and particularly how they worked for over-60s and vulnerable groups with underlying health conditions. “With this data in hand we should influence vaccine manufacturers who have vaccines that have shown the most durable cellular responses to develop an Omicron and a Delta variant vaccine to cover the current mutation lineages,” he said, adding that Professor Paul Moss and the Covid Immunology Consortium had provided “excellent groundwork” for this. Professor Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Everything depends on whether another variant comes up. “A fourth dose or second booster of the existing vaccine probably isn’t going to achieve very much. The evidence is that immunity against severe disease is much longer lasting. The only justification for doing a second booster for the majority of the population would be if we saw clear evidence of people, five or six months after their booster, ending up in hospital with severe Covid.” Health experts are also concerned that the take-up of the booster vaccine last month was driven by the public’s wish not disrupt their festive season. Now that fear has gone it has removed some of the drive to take up the vaccine. In addition there is a widespread perception that Omicron is milder and less worrying, added Simon Williams of Swansea University. “We call ‘variant fatigue’ which translates as people saying ‘this is what viruses do; we just need to get on with our lives.’ It’s not great from a public health perspective.” However, Professor Helen Bedford of University College London, a child health expert, warned that there was a danger in lumping diehard anti-vaxxers with people who have nagging doubts about getting a vaccine. “If you do that you will miss the chance to persuade those who have genuine concerns but who could change their minds and get vaccinated. It does not help to criticise them all as talking mumbo-jumbo.”",News/World news,"End mass jabs and live with Covid, says ex-head of vaccine taskforce",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/08/end-mass-jabs-and-live-with-covid-says-ex-head-of-vaccine-taskforce
1/9/2022,"Ideally, the discussion leading up to the 33rd Africa Cup of Nations, which begins on Sunday as the hosts Cameroon face Burkina Faso in Yaoundé, would have centred on potential winners, surprise packages and stand-out players. Can Algeria defend their crown? Can Mohamed Salah inspire Egypt? Can a north African side win for only the third time in sub-Saharan Africa? Will Senegal, with their depth of talent, triumph for the first time? Why do Nigeria have an interim coach? But instead the discussion, in England at least, has centred on which Premier League clubs will be worst affected by the tournament. A lot of international football can seem like an imposition on the club game but it feels as though the Cup of Nations is always having to justify its existence. More than any other competition, perhaps, it exemplifies the difficulties of drawing up a calendar for a truly global sport.  When the Ajax striker Sébastien Haller was asked whether he would be joining up with Ivory Coast or staying with his club, he reacted angrily. “This question shows disrespect for Africa,” he said. “Would this question ever be asked to a European player ahead of the Euros?” He is almost certainly right about disrespect, but equally the Euros don’t clash with the European season. The issue seemed, superficially at least, to have been resolved in 2017 when the Confederation of African Football (Caf), three months after Issa Hayatou’s 29-year presidency was ended by his election defeat to Ahmad Ahmad, agreed to move the tournament to June-July as part of a wider rationalisation of the global calendar. But in November the following year, because of issues with infrastructure, the Boko Haram insurgency and the Anglophone crisis, the 2019 tournament was shifted from Cameroon to Egypt, with Cameroon taking over 2021 (Ivory Coast, which had been scheduled to host in 2021, will now hold it in 2023, with the tournament in Guinea pushed back to 2025). Although it was moved by a week to avoid Ramadan, the 2019 tournament was staged, as planned, in the European summer. In January 2020, though, Caf decided to return to January‑February for 2021 because of “the challenge of unfavourable climatic conditions” with a June tournament catching the end of the first rainy season. Quite why this was not considered a problem in 2019 has never been explained. As it turns out, with Covid forcing the tournament to be postponed to this year, it’s just as well the tournament is January-February or it would end just four months before the World Cup starts – although as it is Al Ahly will play Monterrey in the Club World Cup on 5 February, the day before the Cup of Nations final, which seems less than ideal for the six Ahly players in the Egypt squad. The 2023 Cup of Nations is still scheduled for June-July even though average rainfall in Abidjan in June is slightly over double that of Yaoundé. Can you play tournament football when there’s 270mm of rain a day? We’ll find out. The other habitual complaint of European clubs is that the Cup of Nations comes every two years, but that is a matter both of history and financial necessity. This is the second-oldest continental tournament, older than the Euros, established in 1957 amid the wave of independence across the continent. Egypt won the first two tournaments (the second as the United Arab Republic after union with Syria) as Gamal Abdel Nasser pursued a radically anti-colonial agenda. The great team of the 60s was Ghana, which had gained independence from Britain in 1957; they bore a black star on their flag and shirts, consciously evoking the Jamaican activist Marcus Garvey. The Cup of Nations has always existed amid a battle for recognition, politically and in football. Only one of the 16 slots at the 1958 World Cup was reserved for Africa/Asia combined (and that ended up being taken by Wales, because of the refusal of numerous teams to play Israel, who were then part of the Asian Confederation; it was the play-off between Wales and Israel that meant Jimmy Murphy, who combined being Wales manager with coaching at Manchester United, was not on the flight that crashed at Munich). Not until 1970, after an African boycott of 1966, were Africa and Asia each guaranteed a place at the World Cup. Hayatou’s argument was that the Cup of Nations had been established at a time when Europe had no time for African football and, even ignoring that the revenue it generates is essential, there was no reason for Africa to change schedule just because European clubs were buying African players in large numbers. That is perhaps better as a starting point for a negotiation than a solution but, in a world of self-interest (not that Hayatou was immune from that), at least it represented somebody standing up for the greater good of African football. Patrice Motsepe, who succeeded Ahmad Ahmad as Caf president in March, is a more instinctively pro-Fifa figure. But whoever is in charge, the problem remains the same. The reality is that European football represents the summit of the club game and a January-February tournament means that, every two years, a tranche of the best African players have to leave their clubs – which cannot be beneficial to their career prospects. But when can the tournament be hosted? It may be that it is not possible to reconcile the northern European winter and the west African rainy season and that, unsatisfactory as it is, this is the best solution. June 2023 in Ivory Coast will offer a clearer picture. Recent calls for a biennial World Cup are part of wider discussions over the calendar. As those negotiations go on, the only hope – perhaps a vain one – can be that footballing rather than commercial or political concerns take precedence, and that the Cup of Nations is treated with the respect it deserves. Cameroon, unlike many recent hosts, has a match-going culture; as a spectacle, unless Covid regulations have a major impact, this can be one of the great Cups of Nations. And that, rather than the frustrations of Premier League fans, should be the focus.",Sport/Football,Premier League fans may be frustrated but Africa Cup of Nations deserves respect | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/08/premier-league-fans-may-be-frustrated-but-africa-cup-of-nations-deserves-respect
1/9/2022,"The Cups are shoring up Chelsea’s season. After a run of three wins in nine games that has made a title challenge extremely unlikely and cost them top spot in their Champions League group, wins in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final and the third round of the FA Cup have restored a sense of stability at Stamford Bridge. This went about as well as it could have done for Thomas Tuchel’s side: ahead early and so in control by half-time that he could afford to rest players in the second half. The magic of the Cup is that anything can happen: even Timo Werner can score. The 25-year-old German, just seven league goals since his £47.5million move from RB Leipzig, had a go both at being offside and missing, but did manage to shovel the ball into an empty net from seven yards after Hakim Ziyech’s initial effort, smartly created by Mateo Kovacic, had been blocked. There was the inevitable wait for VAR to ratify it and for once, having cancelled out 16 previous Werner efforts since his arrival in west London, it did.  And so, after six minutes, the chances of an upset, of the National League side beating the European champions, were effectively gone. Which, in a sense, took the pressure off. 6,000 Chesterfield fans, roughly their average home gate, packed the Shed, determined to enjoy the day – so much so that they greeted the dimming of lights before kick-off with a great gasp of amazement and delight, before perhaps realising that, even in the more remote corners of Derbyshire, lights that go on and off aren’t really that exciting any more, and trying to correct the fault with some jeering, half-heartedly asking, “Who are you?” The answer was swiftly provided: a much better football team that them. Callum Hudson-Odoi, given far too much space, curled a second after 18 minutes, before Romelu Lukaku converted a cross from the debutant left-back Lewis Hall. Chelsea fans responded with applause warm enough to suggest he has been forgiven after his Sky Italia interview. Chesterfield fans responded by chanting “Romelu Lukaku, he’s Inter Milan.” And why not? With the final three-quarters of the game rendered an exhibition, they can hardly be blamed for taking their fun where they could find it. They mocked Chelsea misses and from midway through the first half were begging for waves from their manager James Rowe. This was always a bonus for them, an unlikely dream; their focus is on promotion back into the league – Halifax’s win over Eastleigh on Saturday took them above Chesterfield at the top of the table but they have played two games more. A looping Andreas Christensen header, after the Chesterfield keeper Scott Loach had parried Hall’s shot, made it 4-0 six minutes before the break. The only questions then were whether Chesterfield could nick a goal and whether they could keep the score down to under 7-1, the margin of defeat in 1907 when they last met Chelsea in a league game. The England international George Hilsdon, nicknamed the ‘Gatling Gun’ for the rapidity of his shooting, scored twice in that game but when war came, the Gatling Gun went missing as he tried to dodge his call-up. He was finally found hiding in a chicken run. Badly gassed at Arras, he never played football again, and tried to scrape together a living working as a teaboy on building sites, running a pub and organising raffles. When he died in Leicester in 1941, only four people came to his funeral and he was buried in an unmarked grave. A collection from Chelsea fans bought a headstone in 2015. Hilsdon’s memory, though, lives on: the weather vane on the East Stand – which tradition (and memories of the club’s decline when it was taken for refurbishment in the seventies) says must never be removed for fear of dreadful misfortune – is modelled on him. A mismatch it may be today, but the previous season Chesterfield had been the first away side to win at Stamford Bridge. This is a fixture with history. The answers to both questions were yes. Akwasi Asante gleefully knocked in after the tireless Kabongo Tshimanga’s shot had been saved by Marcus Bettinelli to provide a proper souvenir for the away fans behind that goal. And although Hakim Ziyech converted a 55th-minute penalty, Chesterfield were resolute enough that the scoreline never threatened to become embarrassing; as such, both teams probably ended up satisfied enough. This was the other side of a third-round mismatch: not an upset, but a mildly enjoyable day out for everybody.",Sport/Football,Werner finds finishing touch in Chelsea’s stroll past Chesterfield,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/08/chelsea-chesterfield-fa-cup-match-report
1/9/2022,"Mark Bonner described his Cambridge United’s side’s FA Cup third round giant-killing at Newcastle United’s St James’ Park as a fairytale after watching Joe Ironside’s second-half goal stun the struggling home side. It represented a tactical triumph for Bonner, a 36-year-old new-school manager who never kicked a ball professionally and worked his way up after beginning his career coaching Cambridge’s under-eights.  After promotion from League Two last season, Cambridge are mid‑table in League One, 41 places beneath Newcastle on the ladder. “What an occasion,” he said. “There’s always a fairytale and an upset in the FA Cup and we hoped it would be us this year but then we saw how strong Newcastle’s team-sheet was. “Our goalkeeper [Dimitar Mitov] was brilliant but I am so proud we kept them at bay. We only got promoted last year so keeping a clean sheet is an incredible achievement.” It left the Middlesbrough-born Ironside, who grew up idolising Newcastle’s former centre-forward Alan Shearer, celebrating in front of the 5,000 Cambridge fans. Bonner added: “This day will be remembered for decades. These are the moments you never forget and you never know how long it will be before you experience anything like it again. “Newcastle’s an incredible football club and an incredible city and the noise got big at times but we coped with the atmosphere and, although we rode our luck at times, we also had periods of control and managed to turn it into a great day for our supporters.” While Cambridge operate on one of the third tier’s tighter budgets, Newcastle, with their Saudi Arabian owners, are theoretically the world’s wealthiest club but are facing relegation from the Premier League after winning one game all season. They played poorly here in front of their chairman, Yasir al-Rumayyan, who had flown in from Riyadh specially for the game but departed, grim-faced, flanked by a quartet of bodyguards. Eddie Howe, who revealed that Rumayyan visited the dressing room to offer Newcastle’s players something of a pep talk after the final whistle, said: “We are desperately disappointed. “We wanted to win but we played a very strong Cambridge team and we couldn’t break them down. I have to give credit to Cambridge’s players and their manager.” “We had some good moments but their goalkeeper was outstanding and we lacked the killer instinct every team needs.” Newcastle entertain Watford in a relegation six-pointer on Saturday and Howe said: “We have some season‑defining league games coming up and I just hope this defeat doesn’t damage our players’ confidence. “We just have to take it on the chin and bounce back.”",Sport/Football,Bonner hails Cambridge United’s ‘fairytale’ FA Cup upset at Newcastle ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/08/bonner-hails-cambridge-uniteds-fairytale-fa-cup-upset-at-newcastle
