3/5/2022,"Ican’t say I have confidence in the future, but I have a lot of confidence in its unpredictability, based on the fact that the past has regularly delivered surprises. It’s easy to forget in retrospect how astonishing the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Velvet Revolution were in 1989, or the arrival of the Zapatista army on the world stage in 1994 or how marriage equality seemed like a long shot just before it became a reality in countries all over the world not long ago or how Ireland and Argentina recently legalized abortion. The terrible too comes along without warning. Often a major event – this unforeseen global pandemic, the invasion of Ukraine – then itself has indirect consequences that matter. The pandemic led to a radical shift in the US labor market, including rising wages, worker walkoffs and refusals that at times have seemed tantamount to a general strike, and remarkable labor organizing against some of the most resistant low-wage employers. Both the pandemic and the invasion have significant consequences for climate politics. First of all they should shake loose the expectation that we know what will happen, that the world of next week will be pretty much the same as last week. Second they should mean that people stop saying we can’t make dramatic changes because 2022 seems to be as much about sudden and profound worldwide change as 2020 was. The pandemic pushed oil prices through the floor – one amazing day in the spring of 2020, Texas crude futures dropped to -$37 per barrel. For a while demand also plummeted. What history teaches us over and over is that another surprise is coming, and though the invasion of Ukraine wasn’t a surprise to a lot of us, the way it’s unfolded – Russian fumbling, Ukrainian valor, global response – has been astonishing. Maybe it’s appropriate that it’s Lenin who once said, “There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.” The past week was a decade and an earthquake. Oil prices are high now, but Oilprice.com reports, “Shares in Rosneft, Gazprom, Lukoil, and Surgutneftegas collapsed on the London market, losing as much as $190 billion of their combined market capitalization, or 95 percent.” I don’t know if the world has ever seen a crash like that. The sheer volatility of fossil fuel has made it a bad investment, and on Tuesday the climate divestment movement celebrated that its efforts have resulted in $40tn being divested from fossil fuel. In events not just unforeseen but almost unimaginable until they happened, BP, Shell, Exxon and a number of other major oil companies walked away from their Russian investments and partnerships, which throttles both Russian capacity to extract and to market the stuff. Germany declared that renewables were freedom energy and vowed to accelerate its transition away from fossil fuel and dependence on Russian supplies, and the world acknowledged what climate activists have long been shouting, that fossil fuel is inextricable from corruption and violence. The Nord Stream pipeline company promptly collapsed into bankruptcy. Had anyone described this energy situation a week before it happened, they would have been laughed out of the room. Putin is fighting a retrograde war in Ukraine with a faith in the determinative political power of violence that is as misplaced as it is widespread. His mantra seems to be “make Russia great again,” and his heavy assault techniques sometimes worked in the second world war – and even then sometimes didn’t. What imperial powers should have learned from their wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq is that the will of the people cannot be flattened by bombardment, that hearts and minds are never won that way, and that the damage to your own standing may be what’s most lasting. And in a hyperconnected world, a new equivalent to war has emerged, not as invasion but as exit, blockade, withdrawal and isolation. Russia has been swiftly cut off from everything from sport to technology to material trade to international banking, and the impact is crushing already and will rapidly grow worse. No one in Russia is being bombed but would-be economic refugees are streaming out. Experts widely suspect this policy blunder will be, one way or another, the end of Putin’s grip on Russia, though no one knows how his reign will end. Despair is a delusion of confidence that asserts it knows what’s coming, perhaps a tool of those who like to feel in control, even if just of the facts, when in reality, we can frame approximate parameters, but the surprises keep coming. Anyone who makes a definitive declaration about what the future will bring is not dealing in facts. The world we live in today was utterly unforeseen and unimaginable on many counts, the world that is coming is something we can work toward but not something we can foresee. We need to have confidence that surprise and uncertainty are unshakable principles, if we want to have confidence in something. And recognize that in that uncertainty is room to act, to try to shape a future that will be determined by what we do in the present. It would be unreasonable to predict that we can leave the age of fossil fuels behind and do what the climate requires of us, but it would be unwise to say that it’s impossible, and only our actions can make it possible. The livable world of 2072 is almost unimaginable. But the way that I imagine it is possible is by thinking how unimaginable the 2022 we’re all in now would have been in 1972 and how little it resembles either most science fiction or prediction. We see no farther than the little halo of our lanterns, but we can travel all night by that light. Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

3/5/2022,"Climate activist Finlay Pringle doesn’t mince his words. Boris Johnson? “I hate him,” says the 14-year-old from Ullapool in the Scottish Highlands, before correcting himself. “OK, in polite terms, I severely disagree with him. He’s like the British version of Trump. When he speaks, he sounds like an Oompa-Loompa. Everything is just slogans.” And his future? “I’m angry,” he says. “I’ve been cheated out of my future. People are dying from climate change. The Australian wildfires claimed lives. People in the Maldives will lose their homes.” Pringle is furious, sometimes hilariously, matter-of-factly so. He is also one of the longest-running school strikers in the UK. At the time of writing, he has been striking for an hour every Friday morning for 164 weeks. The worst thing about striking, he says, isn’t standing in the winter snow or sleet, but the highland midges in summer. “I know they’re important for the ecosystem,” he says,“but, man, do I hate them. They’re awful. I get bitten loads.” Some people have assumed his environment-conscious parents forced him into activism – but that frustrates Pringle. “It’s always my decision,” he says. “If they’re doing a beach clean and I say I don’t want to do it, I don’t have to.” Pringle became an environmental activist at the age of 10. It all started because a water company was planning to dump sewage into Loch Gairloch. “I wasn’t trying to be an activist,” he says. “I was just trying to do the right thing.” Pringle loves the sea and often goes snorkelling with his family. “When you’re in and out of the water,” he says, “you’re consumed by it. Nothing else is going on. All you see is what is in front of you. And when you see plastic floating in the water, there’s no beating around the bush.” He campaigned with other members of his local community and helped secure a U-turn: the water company pledged not to dump raw sewage in the loch. “Getting a positive result helped motivate me,” he says. Pringle’s most famous campaign to date brought him head to head with TV survivalist Bear Grylls. In 2018, Grylls opened a dive experience at the NEC in Birmingham. Visitors pay to go diving in a tank with blacktip reef and nurse sharks. The Shark Trust partnered with Grylls on the project, from which it receives donations. Pringle was appalled: “Sharks and captivity don’t go together,” he says. (The Shark Trust disagreed, saying in a statement: “Tens of thousands of people have dived with and learned about sharks at the Bear Grylls Adventure – they go away with a desire to support shark conservation.”) When Pringle found out about the attraction, he began “ranting about it on social media”. He attracted national headlines after telling Grylls he “sucked” and was the “worst chief Scout”. “Oh god,” Pringle recalls, “that was a can of worms.” A spokesperson for Bear Grylls Adventure said: “We’ve partnered with Shark Trust and will donate a proportion of each ticket sold to strengthen the charity’s undisputable contribution to safeguarding the wild population of sharks.” Sharks are Pringle’s favourite animal. “They’re my true passion,” he says. “It’s so wrong, the way we treat them. They deserve our respect, not our fear.” His favourites are, in order: goblin sharks (“they look freaky as hell”), cookiecutter sharks (“they are tiny but can prey on much bigger things”) and Greenland sharks (“they can live up to 400 years”). Pringle is scathing about the solutions to climate change advocated by world leaders. “You know only one country in the world is on track to meet the Paris climate agreement?” Pringle says. “You know which one it is? Gambia! If this tiny, poor country can do it, why can’t we?” The UK is a joke, he says with scorn. “Coal mining in Cumbria. Expanding several airports in the UK. Cutting down ancient woodland for HS2. The list goes on and on.” Pringle plans to be a marine biologist, so when I ask him what he’d like his treat to be, he suggests a pair of binoculars to use on his wildlife-spotting trips. “Watching animals and birds was one of the few things that helped get me through lockdown,” he says. “Just being able to go out on that daily walk, and see the gulls.” Swarovski Optik provides a pair of pocket binoculars. He takes them out for a spin almost immediately. “It’s shocking how good they are for their size,” he says. He plans to go whale-spotting once the weather is good enough. “Whales always disappear behind the cliffs,” Pringle says, “so you have to run to see them. But these binoculars will be perfect for seeing them. They’re brilliant.” Want to nominate someone for Guardian angel?

3/5/2022,"If the long, dark nights of January didn’t see you sorting out your seed store, then get to it now. We are nearing the time when we need to get seeds in the ground but stay patient until we are safely into the middle of March before you really get going. When the days are longer and the sun is that much stronger, all this pours into the seedlings. And sturdier seedlings are better adapted to go out into the world. So, until then, you may as well consolidate your store and sort out all those half-used and out-of-date packets. The idea here is not to throw them out, but to take a gamble on them. For all those packets with just a sprinkling of seed left – look for the sorts of things that can be eaten as baby leaves (spinach, rocket, radish, any sort of brassicas, east Asian greens such as mizuna, pak choi, leafy herbs and lettuce) – dump them into a bowl. Give them a good mix and sow them liberally into pots. I say pots rather than seed trays because if they do germinate, you don’t want them to dry out too quickly. This lot should be sown cheek to jowl, so they need depth for their roots. Water them well and leave them by a radiator, perhaps covered in a clear plastic bag to act as a propagator lid if the radiator is pumping out heat. You want them here just long enough to get germination happening, then move them somewhere with better light (and remove the plastic bag as the leaves often get covered with mildew). The aim is to get them up to microgreen size, about 5cm high, and then eat them. This should take 7-10 days on a warm windowsill. If they grow a little leggy, it’s not a terrible thing; they will be eaten before this becomes a problem. If you have lots of seed, you can reuse the soil: jiggle the surface about and then sow a second batch. I do the same for pea shoots, but I sow these on their own because they rather overcrowd leafy types. If any of these are doing well and I feel that, with a little fleece, they could make it in a polytunnel or greenhouse, I turf them out. Peas, coriander, rocket, winter lettuce and radishes are all good candidates for surviving with a little extra protection once they have three or more true leaves. I’ve had excellent salads in mid-spring from random packets that I’ve scattered over pots. This exercise is mostly about keeping idle thumbs busy; in a couple of weeks it will be all go for serious sowing – and using out-of-date packets is a good way of creating funny salad mixes from the leftovers.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Sow your out-of-date seeds now and you’ll be eating salad leaves in a week | Alys Fowler,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/05/sow-your-out-of-date-seeds-now-and-youll-be-eating-salad-leaves-in-a-week
3/5/2022,"An 18-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after the shooting of a 15-year-old girl at a bus stop. Rio Jones, has been charged with two counts of attempted murder, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, and possession of a controlled drug, Merseyside police said. He was due to appear in court on Saturday. The girl had finished school and was believed to have been standing at a bus stop on Upper Warwick Street in Liverpool’s Toxteth area when the incident happened shortly after 5pm on Tuesday. She was said to be in a stable condition in hospital, and police said it was an “absolute miracle and a credit to the NHS” that she survived. In a press conference at Merseyside police headquarters on Wednesday, officers said that they believed more than one offender was involved and that about four electric bikes may have been in use at the time. Det Ch Supt Mark Kameen said: “It is still, and I have to reassure everyone, very early days in this investigation, however we are working incredibly hard, late into the night and from the early hours of the morning to ensure that this investigation has the absolute traction that it definitely requires.”",News/UK news,"Teenager due in court over shooting of girl, 15, at Liverpool bus stop",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/05/teenager-due-in-court-over-shooting-of-girl-15-at-liverpool-bus-stop
