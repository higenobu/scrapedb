2/9/2022,"Within hours of being stopped on a rural road in Venezuela, former U.S. Marine Matthew Heath told a court Monday, he found himself naked and strapped to a wire mesh connected to a car battery that would shock him between questions from officers of the country’s military counterintelligence. A few hours later, at a different location, he was threatened with being raped with a nightstick if he did not give them the password to his satellite phone. He did. Accused of terrorism by the Nicolas Maduro regime, Heath was at a hearing in his case late Monday when he became upset when he saw one of the men he said tortured him, who was at the hearing for the prosecution. “That’s him!” he screamed, visibly agitated. “That’s the one that hurt me!” The interruption prompted the judge to call him as a character witness and his testimony was so gripping that the magistrate took the unusual step of prolonging the hearing for the next two days. The person Heath identified as his torturer was Reynaldo Hernández, an agent of the Directorate General of Military Counterintelligence, DGCIM for its initials in Spanish, in Falcón state. Hernández was there alongside his supervisor, Maj. Marlon Salas Rivas, who was present during the interrogations, according to the former marine. “It was a good day for the defense,” said Tamara Suju, who is a member of Heath’s legal team, summarizing text statements sent to her from the hearing by Heath’s main lawyer, Guillermo Heredia, who wrote: “It was a victory given that [the person] was identified, and is now subject to an investigation, [the person] who planted the weapons and explosives as evidence and who tortured Matthew”. Heath, 40, was arrested four months after a botched coup in May 2020 launched from Colombia and led in part by a Florida company called Silvercorp USA, an effort that may have been stopped with the help of Venezuelan government infiltrators. Linking these events to Heath, the Maduro regime accuses him of being a spy and a terrorist and claims he was caught in Falcon state carrying weapons and explosives. His family and lawyers, however, claim that he was caught in a series of misadventures while attempting to visit friends by boat to Aruba, a 19-mile-long former Dutch island that is just 15 miles off Venezuela’s northwest coast. How he went from the boat to the volatile region inside Venezuela remains unclear. His family alleges he was kidnapped and extorted in Colombia before his arrest in Venezuela. Although the U.S. has no diplomatic relations with Venezuela under the Maduro regime, the State Department has said that it is monitoring Heath’s situation closely and on Jan. 21 issued a statement highlighting that the former marine had been wrongfully detained for 500 days. “Matthew was arrested in September 2020 on specious charges, and his trial is still ongoing. We continue to seek his unconditional return and the release of all U.S. nationals wrongfully detained overseas, and Secretary [Antony] Blinken is relentlessly pursuing Matthew’s release. To the Maduro regime officials who have imprisoned him, we call for him to be allowed to return to the United States so that he can reunite with his family”, it said in a press release. Heredia’s optimism is due to his belief that the charges against Heath are so clearly trumped up that prosecutors would have an impossible time making them stick, but courts in Venezuela are under the strict control of the regime and serve more as instruments of political persecution than independent entities in the service of justice. Judges are often instructed how to rule by the regime’s leadership, specially in high profile cases, dealing harsh sentences to dissidents and opposition leaders frequently brought in under fabricated charges, international human rights organizations have concluded in different reviews. In a number of instances where a judge has dared to disobey the political orders issued, they have been dismissed or have been charged with corruption. In court testimony last year, Heredia said that Heath was tortured after his capture at a checkpoint in the lawless border area between Colombia and Venezuela called La Guajira. The legal team and his family claimed Heath was subjected to electric shocks, was beaten and had a plastic bag over his head to make him think he’d be suffocated. A complaint alleging this was also filed with the United Nations. In the hearing that lasted until after 3 a.m. Tuesday, Heath gave details of his first days in captivity, and said that within hours of his detention he was taken to a DGCIM installation in Falcón state, where he was forced to undress and locked inside a dark room. “He was later taken outside and was tied to a car and while completely naked, he was doused with cold water and strapped to a wire mesh connected with cables to a car battery. He was interrogated with electric shocks and blows all throughout that night,” Suju recounted based on Heath’s testimony. “The next day he was flown to Caracas and taken to a clandestine torture center ran by the DGCIM. There they took away all his clothes, leaving him again naked, and ordered another one of the prisioners there to rape him. When that did not happen because the prisoner wouldn’t, a member of the DGCIM approached him and threatened him to rape him with the safety baton that they carry”, she added. After that threat Heath agreed to give the agents the codes to access his satellite phone, whose contents they downloaded without finding any type of incriminating evidence, Suju said. Unable to secure a confession or evidence against Heath and those arrested beside him, they were all flown back to Falcón, where the agents feigned a new arrest, this time alongside evidence planted in the vehicle, Suju said. But the irregularities related to the incriminating evidence surfaced again on the Monday night hearing. “They could not justify the procedure used by the National Guard to present the evidence, and they lied once again concerning the evidence report given to the DGCIM because the National Guard first reported that the only objects found were a satellite phone and a black baseball hat”, Heredia wrote. One of the main problems for the prosecutors that surfaced during the hearing was a broken chain of evidence, given that the car where Heath was traveling and where the alleged evidence was found was left abandoned for close to six hours, Suju said. After the second arrest at the scene, officials claimed they had found military-grade weapons inside the car in which Heath was traveling, although some of them were later proven to be too large to fit inside the small compact vehicle. Officials had also claimed that the black cap found was an official DGCIM hat, which prompted the National Guard to first contact the military intelligence unit, but the first report only states that it was a regular hat, Suju said. “All they are doing here is to compile a criminal file based on false evidence and fake procedures to accuse an American citizen”, Suju said. “That is all they are doing”. Facts on all sides of the case are hard to independently verify. From the beginning, Heredia has claimed that the initial police reports and photos, which he said show Heath and three Venezuelan men paraded before local media for having a large amount of U.S. dollars on them, were taken during the second fake arrest. Five days after Heath’s initial media appearance locally, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab appeared on national TV saying a CIA plot had been foiled and that Heath was a spy who had taken sensitive photos of oil installations, had rocket launchers in his trunk and high-powered rifles. They showed the arsenal on TV broadcasts, and claimed he had been carrying an encrypted satellite phone. But Heredia claims that Heath was detained at a roadblock only because the National Guard soldiers wanted to confiscate his satellite phone. “The claim that there were videos and photos of oil installations is false,” Heredia said. “That does not appear anywhere in the case files.”",World/Miami Herald,Former U.S. Marine describes a night of horrors under custody of the Venezuelan regime,https://news.yahoo.com/former-u-marine-describes-night-185620948.html
2/9/2022,"In the moments following the deadly school shooting allegedly carried out by 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley, his mother’s primary concern was losing her job, her supervisor said in court on Tuesday. “Ethan did it,” Jennifer Crumbley allegedly wrote in a text message shortly after gunfire erupted at Michigan’s Oxford High School on Nov. 30. “I need my job,” she pleaded in a second text. “Please don’t judge me for what my son did.” The revelation came from Andrew Smith, COO of the real estate firm where Jennifer was employed as a marketing director. “I was surprised she was worried about her job at that time,” Smith testified, emphasizing that he thought she would have been more concerned about the four students fatally shot that day. Oxford High School Shooter Files New Defense Jennifer and James Crumbley appeared in court Tuesday morning for a pre-trial hearing in Rochester Hills to determine if there is enough evidence to charge the couple with involuntary manslaughter for Ethan’s alleged actions. The two are accused of providing the gun used in the shooting spree, gifting it to Ethan as an early Christmas present. Their lawyers contend the Crumbleys did not know that Ethan was planning a murder spree, and Judge Julie Nicholson must now determine if there is sufficient evidence to bring the parents to trial. In the opening minutes of the hearing, defense attorney Mariell Lehman asked for more time to review the evidence against the couple, saying that it had been markedly more difficult to communicate with the imprisoned Crumbleys due to the pandemic. Nicholson denied her request, indicating the trial would proceed. After the prosecution asked Nicholson to order the pair from communicating from across the courtroom, the judge agreed, specifically barring the Crumbleys from blowing kisses at one another. “It’s disrespectful, and it’s disruptive,” she told them, according to the Associated Press. Smith said Jennifer had texted him the morning of the attack, saying she had a meeting scheduled at Ethan’s school and would be late. A teacher had become alarmed over violent drawings the sophomore had scrawled on a math test, and school administrators wanted to meet with her and James, Jennifer told Smith, attaching a photo of the disturbing content. Jennifer got to work around noon, Smith testified. At 12:51 p.m., Ethan emerged from a bathroom at Oxford High and began “methodically and deliberately” mowing down students as he walked down a hallway, according to prosecutors. A short time later, Smith said he heard Jennifer screaming. “I heard her say there was an active shooter at school and she had to go,” Smith said. Jennifer quickly left the office, texting Smith at 1:30 p.m. with the message, “The gun is gone, so are the bullets.” “Omg Andy, he’s going to kill himself,” she texted Smith in another message. “He must be the shooter.” The day’s first witness, Kira Pennock, owns a horse farm where Jennifer boarded her animals. Jennifer had been drinking when she bought a horse for $5,000 last year, Pennock testified. On the morning of the shooting, Pennock said Jennifer sent her a screenshot of Ethan’s troubling drawing, as well. After the bloody attack, Pennock said she had a feeling that Ethan was the culprit. “I know they own guns and go out shooting, and that math test with everything written on it made me think it was him,” she testified. Pennock said Jennifer later texted a note similar to the one she sent to Smith, thanking her for “not judging her.” “[M]y son ruined so many lives today,” Jennifer wrote, according to Pennock, who said Jennifer subsequently texted again, saying she needed to “sell her horses, stat.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

2/9/2022,"ROCHESTER HILLS, Mich. (AP) — A day before four students were killed at a Michigan school, the mother of the teenager charged with carrying out the mass shooting sent him a text message asking if he had showed teachers a “pic of your new gun,” an investigator testified Tuesday. The text was one of several between Jennifer and Ethan Crumbley on Nov. 29 after school officials left a voicemail informing her that the 15-year-old was looking up ammunition on his phone. A judge must decide if there’s enough evidence to send Jennifer Crumbley and her husband, James Crumbley, to trial on involuntary manslaughter charges. It’s a low threshold under Michigan law, but this case is highly unusual because parents are rarely held criminally responsible for teens accused in mass school shootings. The Crumbleys are accused of making a gun accessible to Ethan and failing to intervene when he showed signs of mental distress at home and at school. Four students were killed and others were wounded in the Nov. 30 attack at Oxford High School, which is roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Detroit,. The school left a voicemail for Jennifer Crumbley the day before the attack informing her that a teacher was concerned about Ethan's ammunition search on his phone. In court, Ed Wagrowski, a computer crimes investigator in the Oakland County sheriff’s office, read aloud a series of texts exchanged between mother and son. “Seriously?? Looking up bullets in school??” Jennifer Crumbley wrote. Her son replied: “Oh yeah. I already went to the office for that. All I did was look up a certain caliber at the end of class because I was curious. Completely harmless.” ""Did you at least show them a pic of your new gun?"" Jennifer Crumbley asked. “No I didn't show them a pic. My God,” he wrote back. The Crumbleys’ attorneys insist the couple didn’t know that their son might be planning an attack and that they didn’t make the gun easy to find in their home. Prosecutor Karen McDonald said she aimed to show that the Crumbleys committed gross negligence and had an obligation to “protect the community.” On the morning of the shooting, Jennifer and James Crumbley were summoned to the school and confronted with Ethan’s drawings, which included a handgun and the words, “The thoughts won’t stop. Help me.” Authorities said the parents refused to take him home and were told to get him counseling. Amanda Holland, a co-worker at a real estate company, said Jennifer Crumbley shared a picture of the drawings when she returned to work from the school meeting. “I told her I thought it was scary. She agreed,” Holland testified. “I said it would be nice for her to take him for a day, go see a movie, go have lunch,” Holland said. “I said she should have brought him home. I thought it was a disturbing photo and this child needed to be around family.” Jennifer Crumbley said “she felt like a failure as a parent,” according to Holland, who added that it seemed a “little sarcastic.” Jennifer Crumbley’s boss, Andrew Smith, said she shared an image of the drawings with him, too, though he didn’t immediately look at it. “She had said her son needed to get some counseling,” Smith testified. “I think she mentioned a family pet had passed away and a grandparent had passed away. She felt as if she was failing him, or a failure.” Smith said he later heard Jennifer Crumbley “screaming down the hallway” after she learned of the shooting. By late afternoon, she expressed concern about losing her job, Smith said. “'Please don't judge me for what my son did.' I was surprised by that text,” Smith told the court. “I was surprised she was worried about her job at that time.” Ethan Crumbley is charged as an adult with murder and other crimes. His lawyers filed a notice of an insanity defense, which will likely freeze his case while experts examine him.

2/9/2022,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A formal effort to evaluate whether North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn should be disqualified as a candidate because of his involvement in the January 2021 rally that preceded the U.S. Capitol riot should be allowed to continue, voters and election officials told a federal judge. Nearly a dozen North Carolina voters had filed a candidate challenge last month against the first-term Republican. On Monday, attorneys for the voters and the State Board of Elections turned in court filings arguing that Cawthorn's motion to cancel the challenge process be rejected. The candidate challenge says Cawthorn fails to comply with the portion of a post-Civil War amendment to the Constitution pertaining to insurrections. Cawthorn’s speech at the rally supporting then-President Donald Trump, his other comments and information in published reports provide a “reasonable suspicion or belief” that he helped facilitate the insurrection, the challenge reads. Speaking at the “Save America Rally” on the morning of the riot, days after he was sworn in to Congress, Cawthorn said the “crowd has some fight in it.” “The Democrats, with all the fraud they have done in this election, the Republicans hiding and not fighting, they are trying to silence your voice,” he added. “Make no mistake about it, they do not want you to be heard.” Cawthorn, 26, who represents far western North Carolina in Congress, said last week that he has “never engaged in, or would ever engage in, an insurrection against the United States.” Cawthorn's attorneys wrote in a Jan. 31 lawsuit that the state’s candidate challenge process violates constitutional rights and should be struck down. A provision in the 14th Amendment that prohibits members of Congress who have engaged in an insurrection to continue serving is not applicable, his lawyers argued. They want U.S. District Judge Richard Myers to issue a preliminary injunction. A hearing date hadn't been set as of Tuesday. Lawyers for the voters on Monday asked that they be permitted to fight Cawthorn's lawsuit as a defendant with the elections board. They said the “reasonable suspicion” standard that the candidate challenge procedure relies upon to examine qualifications places little if any burden upon Cawthorn's First Amendment right to run for office and his right to due process. The voters’ lawyers also said Cawthorn’s attorneys are misguided in arguing that the 14th Amendment provision doesn't apply to Cawthorn because of an 1872 federal law that removed office-holding disqualifications for most Confederates who fought in the Civil War. “Cawthorn argues that the 1872 Act granted amnesty to all future insurrectionists from 1872 until the end of time,” they wrote, adding that the law couldn't be construed as removing political impediments that would otherwise prevent people from taking office from those not yet born 150 years ago. The State Board of Elections, which is already a named defendant, wrote Monday that Cawthorn lacks legal standing to pursue his claims and that his alleged injuries are speculative for now. The candidate challenge process ensures that voters are presented with slates of qualified candidates, which “is fundamental to representative government” and prevents costly special elections in case a winning candidate is disqualified after an election result, state attorney Terence Steed wrote. The next step in the challenge process would be for the state elections board to form a special panel of county board members from the new 13th Congressional District that Cawthorn plans to run in. But a state court ruled recently that the process will be delayed  while redistricting litigation that could alter U.S. House boundaries is resolved. The state Supreme Court struck down legislative and congressional maps last Friday and gave the legislature until Feb. 18 to redraw them.

2/9/2022,"Forget the electric pickup truck wars, which has Ford, GM and Rivian duking it out for market share. The electric wagon-meets-crossover battle is heating up with Toyota, Subaru, Hyundai and Kia all introducing new EVs this year. The latest is Subaru, which opened up reservations Tuesday for its upcoming 2023 Solterra EV. The Solterra, the automaker's first electric vehicle, will go on sale this summer in all 50 states. Customers can pay a $250 refundable reservation fee to select their preferred retailer, pick trim and color — a few choices that will give Subaru important insight into what vehicle variants to prioritize. Subaru has been squeezed by a global shortage of semiconductor chips, meaning any information on what the coming demand might be is useful. Customers will be contacted between April and May 2022 to make the final agreements on the order, including the pricing, availability and financing, the company said. Subaru also announced Tuesday a partnership with EVgo to give customers access to its public EV charging network. The Subaru Solterra is nearly identical to the Toyota bZ4X, both of which were showcased at the 2021 Los Angeles Auto Show in November. Both the bZ4X and the Solterra are the product of a partnership between Toyota and Subaru to jointly develop a platform dedicated to battery electric vehicles. There are a few slight differences between the two vehicles, the taillights being one example. The inside of the Solterra looks a lot like the Toyota bZ4X. The exterior, chassis and all-wheel system — a hallmark of the outdoorsy focused automaker — is Subaru. Solterra comes with a 71.4 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, which is sourced from Toyota, that sits low between the axles and is paired with two electric motors that generate 215 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque. Subaru has estimated the range to be around 220-plus miles and claims the vehicle can be charged from 0 to 80% in just about 30 minutes using DC fast chargers.
