4/5/2022,"Eighty-five years ago, Bobbie Gullett was born in the heart of coal country. She grew up in Dante, Virginia, a bustling municipality of 6,000 with a hospital, a hotel, schools, a movie theater, a taxicab stand, a train line. She remembers living in a worker house owned by the Clinchfield Coal Company: Back then, Gullett recalls, while the supervisors lived up on the ridges, coalminers and their families lived in the hollows of the nearby mountain range. Their squat houses spread along the winding streets of town, which sat in a bowl created by the bumpy, tree-crested hills. In spring and summer, mountain laurel bloomed in the forest and kudzu spread in patches, and in the winter, snow blanketed the town. “You wouldn’t believe how pretty Dante used to be,” said Gullett, reminiscing at the Dante Coal Miners museum on a late January day. Dante’s economy was largely built around coal, and the gains from extraction allowed families in town to prosper. “We lived in a bubble where coal was king, life was good, everybody had money,” added her friend Lou Wallace, whose family worked in railroading. Now all of that is gone. As coal jobs have disappeared from Dante, other industries have not yet taken root. But Gullett and Wallace want to change that – by harnessing new sources of funding to transform Dante into a hub of ecotourism as well as a place where information economy workers can live and work remotely. “Coal is not renewable,” said Wallace. “It’s come to the end of its way. We’ve come to a new generation, and we need to start thinking. We have to be OK with a building becoming something else, with change and renewal.” Gullett and Wallace are part of a group called the Dante Community Association, which is working with other regional and national groups to remediate the town’s abandoned coalmines. The work isn’t just about revitalizing their local economy; it’s also about nurturing the environment around them, and bringing some of the natural beauty Gullett remembers so fondly back to the community. “We feel like we’re doing all this as a pilot program,” said Wallace. “This can encourage other communities to say, wow, we can be forward thinking.” Coal’s retreat from Dante (rhymes with “paint”) started in 1972, when Clinchfield shuttered operations. Today, 600 people live in town, with 40% in poverty. Dante is far from exceptional in Appalachian coal country, which stretches from Ohio down through eastern Kentucky and West Virginia and into this strip of Virginia. While poverty rates have fallen in Appalachia, the average rate for the region is almost two percentage points higher than the rest of the nation. Dante is a “good example” of a community “where there’s a long history and tradition of economies tied closely to a single industry”, said Brad Kreps, a director at the Nature Conservancy, which is helping the town with its plans. Similarly, other towns across the region have experimented with jumpstarting their economies through solar panel fields, recycling centers, tubing, hiking, ATV trails, and more. In 2019, Kreps’ organization bought much of the forested land around Dante for preservation. As Dante and other towns like it contend with the question of how to move on from coal, abandoned coalmines pose some immediate environmental problems: these sites can lead to unstable mountainsides and underground fires, and for years, their byproducts turned nearby rivers bright orange. There are federal programs to help communities that have been blighted by coal clean up these sites – such as the Abandoned Mineland Reclamation Program, which appropriates funds from coal companies to lead remediation. And President Biden’s infrastructure bill will provide $11.3bn for mine remediation. But these programs don’t provide a roadmap for how communities should reorient themselves after the mineland is cleaned up. You can hire workers to clean up those mines – for example, in Clinchco, Virginia, farther north into the mountains from Dante, ex-miners found jobs shoveling out coal-mining waste. But what happens once the land is clear? In Dante, community members want to see their mineland transformed into hiking, ATV, and mountain bike trails that they hope will attract nature-lovers and thrill-seekers to the area. In 2018, Dante received a grant that will allow the town to close two mineshafts in the hills and build a series of hiking and ATV trails that will connect with the Spearhead Trails system leading down into St Paul, a bigger town on the Clinch River. The town is now applying for an additional grant for mountain biking trails and an office space and work training center in town. Some of the grant money has been tied up in bureaucracy thanks to Covid, says Matt Helper, central Appalachian environmental scientist with the nonprofit Appalachian Voices, which is helping the Dante residents with their plans. The trails aren’t built yet, but the money is there, said Hepler. The town has the go-ahead to start building this spring, and they hope to be open by May, when the mountain laurels are blooming in the forests. According to Kreps, these southern Appalachian forests are some of the most biodiverse in the world, and his organization is pleased to have Dante build trails on Nature Conservancy land. For Wallace, an important part of the plan involves highlighting that biodiversity and reframing the way people value the nature in her part of the world. She’s a traveler, she said, but she loves the mountains and hollows (pronounced “hollers”) of Appalachian coal country more than any other landscape. She says she wants “to bring other people here, to see what coal country was like, and to see that it’s not a moonscape, it’s a beautiful forest that we can recreate in.” She also hopes to repopulate the town with a 21st-century workforce. Dante lies in a series of hollows spread out in what Indigenous people called a turkey foot pattern, nestled at the bottom of a ridge of hills. Once, coalminers and their families lived in small houses in those hollows, a tight-knit community centered on work and surrounded by nature. Students at Virginia Tech are now designing prototypes for smart houses that can be built in these hollows, and broadband internet is coming to town this spring. Wallace wants these houses to attract a cadre of newly remote information economy workers. “You’d be able to walk right out of your home and get on a hiking trail,” said Wallace, describing the ideal nature-loving millennial worker whom she hopes would come live in this former coal camp some day. Wallace believes this kind of transformation is possible, because she’s seen a similar change take place in nearby St Paul, the town just eight miles south of Dante, where she grew up and still lives. Twenty years ago, when she opened a marketing firm downtown, “everything was wretched”, she said. But she worked with other community members to start a farmers market. She learned how to write grants from the Nature Conservancy. She got into politics – she now sits as the elected supervisor of Russell county – and made friends. Now, St Paul is home to Virginia’s newest state park, kayak rentals, a brewery, and a hotel. And Wallace believes they can replicate the process in Dante much faster. Some in town are skeptical. The only shop in Dante is a general store, selling canned food, clothes, and prepared foods, on the edge of downtown. The owner, Dennis Porter, said he thinks Dante residents are good people, but that the town doesn’t have a future. “I could tell you that Jesus walks down that street over there every day. But you want the truth? I wouldn’t spend another nickel here,” said Porter, adding that in his view, Dante is “the slum of the county at the end of the world”. Getting buy-in from residents, said Dana Kuhline of Appalachian Voices, is tough in a region that’s been subject to so much scrutiny and hardship. “If you try to paint too rosy a picture, folks aren’t going to buy it – you have to be realistic,” she said. “I think most Appalachian former coal communities have learned to be skeptical of most things, for good reason.” Much work must be done, perhaps, before the community association’s vision comes to fruition. But Gullett pointed out that before Covid, the coal mining museum saw a couple thousand visitors every spring, from places as far away as Australia. People were curious to come down into the hollows and learn what it had all been about. And now, said Gullett, a new industry had to follow. “We need something!” she said. “Something needs to come in.” Outside, a sign stuck in the snow called for more volunteers for the association. It bore the slogan: “Dante will rise!”",News/US news,How an ex-coalmining town is turning to ecotourism to rebuild its economy,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/05/virginia-coal-ex-mining-town-plans-rebuild-economy
4/5/2022,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) department responsible for protecting the public from toxic substances is working under a new definition of PFAS “forever chemicals” that excludes some of their widely used compounds. The new “working definition”, established by the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, is not only at odds with much of the scientific world, but is narrower than that used by other EPA departments. Among other uses, the narrower definition excludes chemicals in pharmaceuticals and pesticides that are generally defined as PFAS. The EPA also cited the narrower definition in December when it declined to take action on some PFAS contamination found in North Carolina. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 12,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. They are in thousands of products across dozens of industries, and have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” due to their longevity in the environment. The discussion within the EPA comes as the agency faces increased pressure to largely restrict the entire chemical class, and critics say the change benefits chemical manufacturers, the Department of Defense and industry. “There’s a real difference in the definition that industry uses and what the international scientific community uses, and, unfortunately, the definition I see the EPA toxics office using is a lot more like industry’s,” said Linda Birnbaum, a former EPA scientist and head of the National Toxicology Program. An EPA official who spoke with the Guardian on the condition of anonymity said the new definition was developed about a year ago and discussions over it were ongoing. The issue comes to light as the EPA’s new chemicals division managers face whistleblower charges that allege management altered risk assessments to make PFAS appear less toxic. The EPA didn’t immediately respond to questions, but an agency document obtained by the Guardian states the new definition “focuses on PFAS believed to be of highest concern based on their persistence and potential for presence in the environment and human exposure”. Researchers say the international scientific community has been engaged in a debate over how to define PFAS that’s focused on chemical structure. PFAS are called “forever chemicals” because their fluorinated atoms prevent them from fully breaking down. The most widely used, inclusive definition, and that proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), defines any chemical with one fluorinated carbon atom as a PFAS. That could include tens of thousands of chemicals on the market. The EPA toxics office, however, wrote a “working definition” that calls for “at least two adjacent carbon atoms, where one carbon is fully fluorinated and the other is at least partially fluorinated”. It covers about 6,500 PFAS, and the EPA is using that definition in its recently introduced “national testing strategy”, which serves as a road map in its attempt to rein in PFAS pollution. Beyond chemicals in pesticides and pharmaceuticals, the narrower definition excludes some refrigerants and PFAS gases. Some of the excluded PFAS compounds turn into highly toxic chemicals, like PFOA and PFOS, as they break down in the environment or are metabolized by the human body. And the production of some excluded PFAS requires the use of other more dangerous PFAS compounds. “How do you say something is not PFAS when it becomes PFAS after it is metabolized by the body or undergoes changes in the environment – that just doesn’t hold with me,” Birnbaum said. The definition debate also partly centers on the chemicals’ “persistence”. The vast majority of chemicals with a fully fluorinated carbon atom will not fully break down, and some of those compounds are accumulating at concerning levels throughout the planet, noted Ian Cousins, a Stockholm University PFAS researcher who has co-authored papers on the topic. “The levels are increasing but toxicity is low, so should we be concerned?” he asked. “I say ‘Yes’, because we shouldn’t be releasing substances … that increase in the environment and eventually we may find a problem when it’s too late to reverse.” Cousins and other experts say a discussion over how to narrow the definition is warranted, but the toxic office’s approach is too restrictive. The EPA’s Office of Research and Development appears to have found a middle ground and is working from a definition that encompasses about 12,000 PFAS compounds. Meanwhile, the US congresswoman Deborah Ross introduced legislation that would establish one fluorinated carbon atom as law. The EPA official who spoke with the Guardian said they were not part of the discussion that preceded the definition change, but said chemists in the agency’s new chemicals division probably developed it. The employee said the chemists probably defined the compound solely on the chemicals’ structures, not the threats they present to human health and the environment. The employee said the exclusion of some PFAS compounds was “a problem”, but developing an appropriate definition was “tricky”. The definition change’s implications have already been seen in North Carolina’s Cape Fear basin, a region contending with decades of pollution from a PFAS manufacturing plant owned by chemical giant Chemours. A 2019 citizen group petition asked the EPA to conduct studies that would shed light on the health impacts of 54 PFAS compounds found in human blood and water in the region. In the agency’s December 2021 response, it declined to test for 15 chemicals it said “do not meet” the toxic’s office PFAS definition. The citizen groups are suing, and the justice department and EPA are coordinating with Chemours for their defense, said Bob Sussman, an environmental attorney for the groups. The EPA wrote in its response that some of the excluded chemicals “are expected to degrade in the environment”, and some will turn into TFA, which the office called a “well-studied substance”. But researchers say most substances, like TFA, don’t fully break down, and studies show it is accumulating in the environment and toxic during prolonged exposure. Critics also stressed that there was very little data on the toxicity of some excluded chemicals, and permitting the use of PFAS with little toxicological data has led to problems. The EPA in November reported GenX, PFOA and PFOS – three widely used compounds – are much more toxic than previously thought, noted Kyla Bennett, a former EPA scientist now with Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. “That’s the biggest issue: the EPA just doesn’t know,” she said. “I would rather use the precautionary principle and capture chemicals that maybe don’t deserve to be regulated as strongly than miss [dangerous chemicals].”",News/Environment,Scientists sound alarm at US regulator’s new ‘forever chemicals’ definition ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/05/epa-pfas-definition-scientists-forever-chemicals
4/5/2022,"A rioter who believed the QAnon conspiracy theory and joined the insurrection by extremist supporters of Donald Trump at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, as they attempted to overturn his election defeat, has been sentenced in New York to 3.5 years in prison. Samuel Fisher, 33, was sentenced on Monday after being charged with illegal possession of firearms, including a modified semi-automatic AR-15-style assault rifle, a “ghost gun” pistol, a shotgun, and 11 pre-loaded high capacity magazines at an apartment in the upscale Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan. He had pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. For years, Fisher established a prolific online presence, the authorities said. Under the alias Brad Holiday, Fisher posted photos of himself with firearms on Facebook and YouTube. In one, Fisher posed in front of a flag that said “Don’t tread on Trump. Keep America great” while grinning and holding a pistol. “Can’t wait to bring a liberal back to this freedom palace,” he wrote as his caption. Behind him was a rifle and a shotgun. Fisher was also a self-declared dating coach who sold a $150 package of misogynistic supposed tips and tricks for men to pick up women, called “Attraction Accelerator”, the New York Times reported. “How to use online dating to build abundance of women! Never feel that you can’t get women again…with online dating you’ll ALWAYS be getting laid,” his website said. In a video posted online, Fisher said, “Is Satanism a good thing? Should we conjure demons to get our goals met like the Left does?” He added: “Are women trustworthy in 2020? You tell me. I’ll tell you, No.” Prior to the January 6 insurrection aimed, on the urging of Trump at a rally prior, at preventing Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s victory over Trump, Fisher espoused QAnon conspiracy theories online and claims that the 2020 election was “stolen”. In reference to a pro-Trump, so-called Stop the Steal rally, the authorities said Fisher told a Facebook friend: “Get a firearm and go, lol, its 1776 time dawg.” He also went on to write online: “The Deep State is arrested and hanged on the White House lawn for High Treason. We rebuild America with a government for the people by the people…Patriot show up in the millions with guns. They execute all the treasonous members of government and rebuild.” Trump believed a “deep state” secret shadow government existed to thwart his agenda. In 2020, after attending the deadly January 6 riots on Capitol Hill, Fisher wrote on his social media accounts that “people died” but it was great, according to court records reviewed by the New York Times. “Seeing cops literally run…was the coolest thing I’ve ever seen in my life,” he continued. Fisher was arrested on 20 January 2021, outside his Upper East Side apartment in New York City in connection with his involvement with the Capitol attacks. Police found a shotgun, machetes and over a thousand rounds of ammunition in his vehicle, according to court records. In a statement on Monday, Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg said: “Samuel Fisher is a dangerous conspiracy theorist who participated in one of the gravest attacks on our democracy. Not only did he threaten to commit violence against his fellow citizens, he had the potential to follow through with his arsenal of advanced weaponry and ammunition.”",News/US news,Capitol attack rioter gets 3.5 years in prison for illegal possession of guns,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/05/capitol-attack-rioter-samuel-fisher-sentenced-new-york
4/5/2022,"Even newly arrived in London, 1,300 miles away from Ukraine, Andrey Kurkov feels as if he’s in a war zone. His phone – its settings still monitoring the location west of Kyiv where he is based – buzzes constantly with warnings of air raids. Ukrainians have all downloaded these apps. The font and design are the same as our Covid apps. Over the course of our hour-long meeting, a siren blares out three times. How do you get used to that? He shrugs. “The main thing is that you are tired all the time. Everyone is sleeping badly. Sirens are going off five times a night. You don’t necessarily have to get up and leave the house when that happens. But you wake up and fall asleep constantly and try to decide whether you should leave the house …” In the beginning, everyone went dutifully to the shelters every time the sirens went off, he explains. But after a while you become blase and you don’t bother: life is too short and you learn to take your chances. “Officially, you’re supposed to go down to the shelters but not everyone does. I guess you could call it Russian roulette,” he smiles. Over the past month, Kurkov, 60, has found himself in an unusual and unexpected position. As Ukraine’s most famous and successful living writer (he has been described as “the Ukrainian Murakami”) – and the writer most translated into English, not to mention more than 30 other languages – suddenly, he is in demand at the worst time and for the worst reasons. He has invitations to speak all over the world, in person and on Zoom. He has a weekly slot on BBC Radio 4 – Letter From Ukraine, a personal account of his daily life. According to Nielsen Book data, sales of his books in translation in the UK are up more than 800%. But he has no intention of leaving Ukraine and tells me that he will be returning home in a few days. His English wife, Elizabeth Sharp, a teacher, is there, as are two of his three adult children. They are volunteering: working with refugees, teaching English. They all found themselves surprised at how quickly you adapt to the worst circumstances. “At the beginning, you’re in a state of shock,” he says. “But then you just adapt to it psychologically. I’m not scared of war any more. You just get this sense of fatalism. That what will be will be. And you just have to keep on living and do whatever you can in the circumstances. It does give you this kind of energy. And a conviction that it is possible to fight against a force of evil that is bigger than you are.” Kurkov does not appear unhappy to be a spokesman for the nuances of an entire culture, and he comes across as optimistic, motivated even. We meet at a cafe in north London, where the owner is very excited to serve someone from Ukraine and wants to express tearful admiration and bestow extra baklava, saying: “The Ukrainian people are an inspiration to us all!” Kurkov beams in response (“I know! My son can make a molotov cocktail! I’m so proud!”), even though this is a conversation he must now endure with every new non-Ukrainian he meets, as will probably be the case for the rest of his life. “I thought I’d lost my sense of humour,” he laughs, “but I was doing a public event last night and I found myself improvising all these sad jokes … Once the adrenaline gets going, you get your sense of humour back.” Our conversation is in Russian, the language of his parents and of about a third of Ukrainians, because he is tired of speaking English. Russian is – and will remain – the language of his fiction. Before the war, he was known in literary circles as someone who always had something amusing or wry to say – whether about post-Soviet life or life in general. Even now he peppers his Twitter feed about life under Russian bombardment with pictures of his cat: “Pepin the cat is happy. It’s not easy to be happy when you are refugee. Even if you are a cat-refugee.” (Unfortunately his hamster, Semyon – also mentioned in dispatches – died in mid March.) Kurkov’s novels are playful, embrace the surreal and often feature animal characters. The bestseller Death and the Penguin is about an obituary writer who adopts a penguin called Misha. There is, delightfully, also a human Misha in the book, who is referred to as Misha-non-penguin. His early books had titles such as The Adventures of Baby Vacuum Cleaner Gosha and The World of Mr Big Forehead. Kurkov’s 2018 novel Grey Bees, had already confronted the conflict with Russia. The book is set in the no man’s land between loyalist and separatist forces in the Donbas region, and follows the plight of a retired official turned beekeeper as he moves his hives to escape to safety. He tells me his work is most popular in translation in French, German and Japanese, as well as English, and last year he spent most of the year as a visiting professor in the US. “It has always been the case that no matter where I am in the world people are more interested in hearing what I have to say about Ukraine than they are interested in my books,” he says. When asked what we can do to help Ukraine, his first thought is to recommend nonfiction. “Find out more about Ukraine. Read about our history: Serhii Plokhy’s The Gates of Europe; Anne Applebaum’s Red Famine; Timothy Snyder’s Bloodlands. It’s really important to understand the difference between Russia and Ukraine. If you really want to know about Ukraine’s history and why this is happening, read those books.” Recommending Ukrainian writers is harder, he says. “Our literature is very introverted, inward-looking. It is directed towards those who already understand what is being discussed. Open, outward-looking literature with a universal message is harder to find. That’s more in the direction that I write.” The books that do pass that “universal” test for him include Sweet Darusya: A Tale of Two Villages, by Maria Matios – an epic family saga set in a village on the Romanian-Ukrainian border – and Markiyan Kamysh’s Stalking the Atomic City: Life Among the Decadent and Depraved of Chornobyl (coming out in translation in July) – an autobiographical novel about life in the exclusion zone around Pripyat, told by the son of a Chernobyl liquidator. These days Kurkov has set the universal aside, along with the new novel he was writing, to focus on analysing the here and now. Since the war began, he has experienced a change of heart about Ukraine’s president. “For me there are two Zelenskiys. The first version – the pre-war Zelenskiy – I did not like at all. I didn’t vote for him. I didn’t like that he surrounded himself with his mates from his previous career, all these people who don’t know anything about politics or about anything, really.” This is said with serious disapproval. “But his role as a war hero … That’s a role where he really excels. The government is functioning. Everything around him is working exactly as it should. I admire that.” Can Zelenskiy hope to stay safe and stay in Kyiv? “Oh yes. I think he will be able to continue that, and to stay in Kyiv.” A glint in the eye: “My only fear is that once the war is over he’ll go back to being the same pre-war Zelenskiy.” Kurkov is keen to emphasise that this criticism is his personal view and not necessarily one that is widely shared. Zelenskiy won 73% of the votes in the presidential elections in 2019. Surprisingly – given Kurkov’s reputation as a brilliant satirist – Zelenskiy’s comedy is the opposite of a redeeming factor. “He was always popular with people who have a terrible sense of humour and are poorly educated. His humour is like a kind of political version of Benny Hill – if Benny Hill had got paid to make jokes about the politicians of the day.” What’s his analysis of why this happened now? And what comes next? “The reason this war took everyone by surprise is because so many politicians in the west really wanted to maintain a positive attitude towards Russia for economic reasons. They wanted to trade with Russia. And they didn’t think Putin would do anything to jeopardise that trade relationship. Turns out, Putin spits on any kind of economic reasoning, he spits on thousands of dead soldiers … For him the most important thing is to go down in history as the man who re-created the Soviet Union – ‘He made Russia great again’. But it hasn’t worked out. While he’s not dead, the war will continue.” He adds: “Putin is old. He is not thinking rationally. He lived underground during the pandemic for the best part of two years. He’s paranoid. He doesn’t like speaking to anyone at a distance of less than five metres. He is terrified of being poisoned, of viruses. He’s been sitting there in his bunker and thinking about what his legacy will be. So this had become his idée fixe. He is obsessed with the fall of the Soviet Union. For him this is a terrible tragedy, which must be reversed. This is his mission. It’s not rational. It’s just how it is.” Kurkov’s parents died two years ago. They were from a generation that did not need to make national distinctions, because they felt “Soviet”. His father was a pilot, his mother a doctor. He recalls fondly how his mother used her clout at a military hospital to get him a visa when his wife finally accepted his proposal of marriage. (Elizabeth first came to Russia on a student exchange in the 1980s. He proposed to her three times before she said yes.) In some ways he is glad his parents are not alive to see this moment. “A few weeks ago, on Facebook, there were hundreds of posts by people around my age who had lost their parents to heart attacks. All caused by the shock of the invasion. I don’t think my parents would have survived it, were they still alive.” Kurkov was born in Russia, in what was then Leningrad, and is now St Petersburg. Does he think he will ever return to the country within his lifetime? “Well, I’ll be 61 years old soon. So … No. I’ve crossed Russia out. And Crimea. The newspapers in Russian have written about me as an enemy and a Russophobe. And we’re talking about a place where 80% of the population support Putin. So I have zero interest in visiting. I have no interest in their culture, their history.” As we’re finishing up, the siren on his phone sounds again. “There it goes. That’s where my wife is …” he says, sadly. But, then, he adds with a wink: “Technology is a good thing. It means you can sleep with the window closed. Because the app will tell you if they’re coming.”",Arts/Books,‘I’m not scared of war any more’: Death and the Penguin author Andrey Kurkov on life in Kyiv,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/05/im-not-scared-of-war-any-more-death-and-the-penguin-author-andrey-kurkov-on-life-in-kyiv
4/5/2022,"Innovation in rugby tends to divide people into two camps. The purists prefer their game to remain gloriously unchanged while casual fans are more open to proactive experimentation. Rare indeed are those “unicorn” moments when both tribes are happy and something feels so immediately right it should have happened years ago. European club rugby, either way, is entering a new era. This weekend will bring the introduction of a two-leg “round of 16” in the Champions Cup and, as yet, there is barely a dissenting voice to be heard. Because if you are, for example, a Munster fan, the best of both worlds awaits: a tantalising away trip to England followed by the thunderous hum of a major Thomond Park rematch a week later. Looking forward to it? Of course you are. In the case of Bordeaux and La Rochelle a spicy triple‑header is already under way. On Saturday, Bordeaux’s head coach, Christophe Urios, had a touchline spat with his La Rochelle counterpart, Ronan O’Gara, and was quoted in the French press as using the word “unbearable” to describe the Irishman. Let’s just say the pot is already bubbling furiously with another two parts of the trilogy still to unfold. Football has been following this model for years. Judging by the profile of the Champions League, it would seem to be working pretty well. The only potential snag, the curse of further Covid disruption aside, is rugby’s scoring system. If a home team go down, say, 31-21 to an 80th-minute interception try in an otherwise tight first leg, clawing back a 10-point deficit on away soil the following week will be a daunting assignment. But think of the array of possible scenarios. Let’s say Exeter are leading Munster by a point this Saturday with 10 minutes to go. What do they do next? No longer can sides who take an early lead sit back and park the bus. If they do, one tiny fumble could change everything. Instead, the potential to take an eight-point lead to Limerick will keep everyone at full tilt right up until the 80th minute. At which point there will still be another 80 minutes to negotiate … Racing 92 v Stade FrancaisBristol v Sale Harlequins v MontpellierLa Rochelle v Bordeaux Ulster v ToulouseMunster v Exeter Leicester v ClermontLeinster v Connacht - Stylistically, the new dynamic will also be fascinating. Do teams keep some tactical ploys under wraps in the first leg? Or simply seek to blitz their opponents with three tries in the first 20 minutes to kill the tie off as early as possible? Will they kick more away from home and opt for damage limitation? Or will the revised tournament structure play into the hands of the stronger French and Irish sides, with their superior squad depth? Home advantage will have to be maximised to the full. Take the opening tie in Galway on Friday. Leinster have played there as recently as last Saturday week, winning 45-8. But Connacht had a player sent off within three minutes, significantly skewing the outcome. While Leinster will be turning up with their Ireland internationals this time, so will their hosts. Connacht have beaten Stade Français 36-9 this season and lost by the odd point to the runaway English league leaders, Leicester. What if Leinster suddenly find themselves dealing with an early red card and a stiff Sportsgrounds wind in their faces? In theory, they should have the squad depth to stay on course if the first leg is an unscheduled disaster. But from almost every perspective – coaching, playing and spectating – there are fresh dynamics at play. The idea should have been a feature of last year’s competition, only for Covid to ruin the plan, and the sudden-death element adds a further edge. No “away goals” count here, with extra time to be played if the aggregate score is level after 160 minutes. Will familiarity, in some cases, breed contempt? Bristol, for example, beat Sale 32-15 at Ashton Gate as recently as January. Since then, though, the Bears have been looking defensively porous. Which makes a two-leg tie extremely hard to call. If any side can cut loose and alter the complexion of a tie inside 15 minutes it is Pat Lam’s team. It will also test the ability of one or two French sides to perform two weeks in a row. Montpellier, Clermont and Toulouse will fancy flexing their muscles at home and defeating Harlequins, Leicester and Ulster respectively. But will the margins be sufficient to protect them on their travels the following weekend? Look down the list of games and how many likely home-and-away double bankers do you see? Two or three out of eight, at most. In all the other subplots – not least the Parisian “derby” between two clubs who came close to merging not long ago – there is also the tennis-style draw that makes it impossible for probably the two title favourites, Racing 92 and Leinster, to meet before the final. For all France’s grand slam heroics in the Six Nations, it is by no means impossible that three of the quarter-finals could take place on English or Irish soil. Should Bordeaux and Toulouse progress, for example, they may well have to travel in the last eight and Leinster, having had their pool game in Toulouse controversially postponed, could end up going to Welford Road if Leicester edge out Clermont. That is not to say an English side is set fair to hoist the trophy. The Premiership has been a slightly mixed bag this season and Harlequins, Leicester and Exeter will do well to make the last four, never mind the final.

4/5/2022,"Diego Simeone believes Atlético Madrid will have to improve on the performance that knocked out Manchester United if the Spanish champions are to beat Manchester City in the Champions League quarter-finals. Simeone’s side are at the Etihad Stadium for Tuesday’s first leg, having knocked United out 2-1 on aggregate in the previous round, their 1-0 victory at Old Trafford in the second leg proving decisive. The Argentinian was asked about what will be required to progress. “United had different characteristics,” he said. “They are a lot more direct, a lot quicker. City are more positional – they manage things very well all over the pitch. We’ll have to be better than we were three weeks ago. “What I like most about teams like City is the strength and effort they put into winning the ball back and continuing to attack. They’re lovely to watch. They continue evolving. They have great players. [Raheem] Sterling, Kevin De Bruyne, they’re always active, they always run. They never leave a ball lost. That’s additional to their talent. All managers want that.” Asked if the pressure is greater on City because they are one of the tournament favourites, he said: “I don’t know if pressure is the correct word. It’s a bit exaggerated. Each one of us has it. City possess extraordinary players. They have better players than us, I am sure. “But there are two games to play. City and Bayern [Munich] are favourites because of their players but last season Chelsea won [the competition] – not many expected that. All of us who are at this point want to win it. You have to compete. “City and Madrid have great squads. They’ve got a lot of personality and tomorrow is for the players. We try to help them so they can respond in the best way possible. We’re going to play where we think we can hurt them. The way we’ve been playing for years. We’ll see.”",Sport/Football,Diego Simeone tells Atlético to improve on United win to beat Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/05/diego-simeone-tells-atletico-to-improve-on-united-win-to-beat-manchester-city
4/5/2022,"Sheila Hicks – American-born textile artist, Parisian since 1964 and, at 87, en pleine forme – has a plan for my visit, but it’s not entirely clear to me what it is. She greets me outside her studio – the platonic ideal of a cobbled courtyard in the Latin Quarter, with creeper-draped buildings of startling beauty, an ancient well, even an elderly gent processing elegantly out the gates on a bicycle. Speaking in the soft but decisive tones of a lady of great age who knows precisely what she’s about, she points to various windows – here Hockney had a studio, here Tony Richardson, you know? He was married to Vanessa Redgrave. Here Robert Carsen, the opera director. Balthus had his studio up here. She proceeds at a stately pace towards the courtyard’s back entrance. Here Dr Guillotin experimented. He placed his equipment here you see and the blood ran downhill, here. He tried it out on sheep. We pass into the street. It eventually transpires, via more points of interest (here, a revolutionary newspaper was produced), that we are going for lunch at the platonic ideal of a Parisian bistro; I half expect us to wander off to Les Deux Magots for coffee with Gertrude Stein. We are also, at last, going to talk about her work as an artist – if that one word does not seem too flimsy when one considers an oeuvre that has encompassed design and magazine editing and tapestry and sculpture and weaving and painting and collaboration with architects. She is about to open an exhibition of her work at the Hepworth Wakefield, just the latest chapter in a long life that began in Nebraska in 1934. Her artistic lineage is mighty: it stretches back to the Bauhaus, since it was the great German painter Josef Albers who trained her at Yale – Josef being the husband of the also great German weaver Anni Albers, both of whom had been stalwarts of the school during the Weimar republic before fleeing to the US. But first, it is I, seemingly, who must answer a question. “What colour do you think of when you think of Anni Albers?” Hicks asks, her mischievous gaze penetrating. Sensing that there may be a right and a wrong answer, I desperately rake back through my memories of the Tate Modern exhibition in 2019 and eventually mumble something about no particular colour, in fact, coming to mind. “Exactly!” she says. “The colour seems completely arbitrary.” She tells me that Albers’ textiles were all about structure. She, Hicks, on the other hand, is all about colour. “Colour is in my blood! A chacun son domaine!” It is colour she wants to talk about today. We discuss the sunflower gold of my blouse; her shirt, blue as the Paris sky on the first spring day of the year; the buttery yellow of the jacket she wore that past Monday to the Stella McCartney show. Later, back at the studio – an enticing cave whose shelves glimmer with reels of jewel-coloured thread – our conversation is punctuated by murmured instructions to her assistants. They, four of them, are sitting around a long table, working great lengths of yarn in flame and scarlet and green and blue into voluptuous ropes, an eventual sculpture. She works, she says, “like a painter. A little bit more here, a little more here, paint over that, pull that out. It’s not like working on a loom where you set up a programme. It’s intuitive: stroke by stroke. I can change it at any moment.” She murmurs, “A droite … Un peu moins … pour calmer un peu l’orange …” What she does not, for instance, want to discuss is the fundamental and ancient role of weaving in human society, its function as a metaphor, its place in myth. She thought about all that many years ago when she was travelling round Latin America on a Fulbright scholarship in the late 1950s, studying pre-Columbian textiles. She had been inspired in that line of study by her Yale art history professor, the hugely influential George Kubler, author of The Shape of Time, who not only showed his students a lot of slides of Andean mummy bundles but “looked like a walking mummy bundle … a fascinating man, he presided over his classes in such a powerful way”. As a result of those classes she’d experimented with reconstructing ancient weaving techniques on a simple loom, which started her off on textiles, at the same time as she was studying painting under Albers. Even now she makes small weavings on a simple frame as a kind of diary. Later, she shows me some of these woven “notebooks” into which she has incorporated feathers, or corn husks, or scallop shells like the ones left over from our bistro lunch, or twigs collected with her granddaughter from the Jardin du Luxembourg. But today, she waves aside all that ethnographic stuff that she used to be interested in. “I’ve moved on. I’ve been around the block 10 times already! I’ve set myself the task of working, making, thinking and doing art that deserves to be noticed strictly because it’s art.” She makes, it seems, no hierarchical distinction between things that are made to fit a slot in a building, things that are made to answer a commission, and things that are destined for a gallery. “I sense you don’t much like to be pinned down,” I moot. “That’s certainly what my husband would say,” she replies, quick as Katharine Hepburn. “Everything I do is only intended for one person,” she says. Herself, of course. “I like it, and I like doing it.” The rest – conversations with curators, or publishers, or architects – that’s a second-order matter. In the 1970s, she even made embroidered panels for the interiors of Air France’s first fleet of Boeing 747s. Her assistants on that occasion were nuns from a silent Carmelite convent. They needed the work. The bottom was falling out of the communion-wafer market. There are other stories to be told, too: the time she pissed off all the Armenian carpet dealers in Paris when she bought up tons of rugs from the auction house Drouot, to be used in Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining (though they never were). And the time, when she was editing the magazine American Fabrics and Fashions, when she got Madame Grès a fancy Dutch art fellowship because the fashion designer, she argued, “was really a sculptor”. Tiny, ancient Mme Grès “in her turban and Jaguar drove to the Hague and got the award and got into her car and drove straight back” – skipping her own party. And afterwards, the great couturier made Hicks a black-and-red dress (which Hicks may or not wear to her opening in Wakefield), the grande dame sitting on the floor with pins in her mouth while Hicks said to her, “I’m so embarrassed,” and Grès responded, sternly, “Madame, you too are a woman who knows what it is to do your métier.” Colour, though: Josef Albers was the great colour theorist, his classes on the subject famous – and Hicks taught his class herself, afterwards, in Chile, on her Fulbright. But she tells me that the earliest work in the Wakefield exhibition predates her classes with him: it’s a painting from a summer she spent in Taxco, Mexico, in 1954. She’d already done two years at Syracuse University, until – and this story is delivered with a certain sangfroid, its tragedy perhaps blunted for Hicks by time and retelling – a friend of hers from the course suggested they try to transfer to Yale. The Ivy League institution, at the time, aside from a handful of girls at the art school, “took only boys. Which we thought would be fun. Not much competition, right?” So her friend took their portfolios over in the Easter vacation, “and it was Albers who looked at them. He liked her work. He liked my work. He said ‘Yeah, put these girls in’. And then that summer, my friend stuck her head in the oven and gassed herself.” “What do I do now? I didn’t want to go back to school, because everyone was going to ask what happened.” She took that summer in Taxco to think about it, then decided: “I’ll go to Yale because I don’t know anybody. I don’t have to answer to anybody. What happens happens. Of course, I knew about colour before I got to Yale because that’s what Albers saw in me.” She describes how he would set weekly exercises for his colour class, then he’d gather in the work from the students anonymously and pick out pieces to talk about in the class. “And most of the time he was using my work – anonymously pulling it up and using it as examples. So there was a kind of mutual appreciation – but anonymously. You were sticking to the subject. It was not a gender subject. It was not a race subject. It was none of that. It was colour.” And then there was Anni Albers. Hicks laughs when she tells me how she gets defined as Anni Albers’ pupil. Not a bit of it. When she started making those improvised looms for her art-history studies, though, Josef Albers introduced the two of them. Anni didn’t teach at Yale – there was no weaving department and there were certainly no female professors. Josef “wasn’t even very polite. He said, ‘Come with me, girl, be in my office at four, we’re going to meet my wife.’” Hicks, “like a dumb student”, had no idea who his wife was. The guy painting next to her hissed, “You don’t go home with your teachers!” And Hicks hissed back, “I don’t think I have a choice.” And what about Anni Albers? “Oh, she wasn’t in the least bit impressed with my stuff.” You sense Hicks doesn’t really care too much for the association, thought it can be useful, and she is nothing if not a pragmatist, picking up opportunities along the way and working to no one’s agenda but her own. And so I leave her, and she turns back, perhaps in relief, to the demands of the flame and the scarlet and the blue and the green.

4/5/2022,"Bring to mind, if you will, Gap’s classic logo hoodie. You know the one: three bold letters arranged in an arch across the chest. It was everywhere in the 1990s and 00s, sold in a rainbow of saturated colours. This sweatshirt didn’t signal a taste for fashion so much as a desire for comfort at a reasonable price. It was like the air we breathed, or the muzak floating around as we prowled the mall, ever-present and hardly worth remarking upon. Over the years, the sweatshirt faded out of view, until, in 2020, an odd thing happened: it suddenly became a hot fashion item at the hands of gen Z. On Instagram and TikTok, stylish young influencers started posting photos and videos of themselves wearing Gap hoodies. Suddenly these hoodies looked rather hip and cool. The YouTube star Emma Chamberlain posted a series of photos of herself on Instagram, her expression oscillating between detached, sleepy, and slightly mournful, as she stood next to a pool wearing white bikini bottoms and a navy Gap logo hoodie. The post received more than 2.4 million likes. Over the next few months, numerous influencers incorporated the sweatshirt into their outfits on social media. Barbara Kristoffersen, a Danish influencer with almost 748,000 followers on Instagram, wore a brown Gap hoodie with wide-leg brown pants and a matching Louis Vuitton handbag. The UK-based Lucy Page, with 12,400 followers on Instagram, wore it with cow-print pants and chunky sneakers. “I wish I could tell my younger self that she’ll be back to wearing GAP hoodies in the future,” Page wrote on Instagram. Soon enough, TikTok’s amateur fashion commentators were declaring the Gap logo hoodie a full-on trend. What happens on fashion TikTok tends to be fleeting, but sometimes these trends are signs of broader shifts in the culture. Natalie Langhorne, who posts fashion-related videos on TikTok, told me that conditions were prime for a Gap comeback. Young shoppers were going wild for logo-heavy clothes from brands like Nike, Gucci and Louis Vuitton, and, chronically nostalgic for the recent past, they were adopting “Y2K fashion” in droves. “Gap literally fits all of that criteria,” said Langhorne, who is 24 and lives in Philadelphia. Influencers were making Gap hoodies the focal point of their outfits, elevating them from an everyday default to a fashion statement. Last summer, hoping to capitalise on this flurry of interest, Gap released a limited edition version of the brown logo hoodie and asked TikTok users to vote for the next colour. Influencers like Kristoffersen started featuring the hoodie in Instagram posts sponsored by Gap; Langhorne has received several sweatshirts as a gift from the brand. Gap needed the buzz. Once one of the biggest names in retail, the San Francisco-based chain has been struggling for the better part of two decades, as shoppers have migrated toward more stylish and less expensive brands. Its position has slipped within its parent company, Gap Inc, which also owns Old Navy (budget-conscious clothes for the family), Athleta (workout gear for women), and Banana Republic (office wear for young people). As its original brand, Gap may still be the corporation’s spiritual foundation, but it is no longer central to its financial success. In 2021, Old Navy, with its cheerful, family-friendly basics (matching patterned pyjamas for the holidays, and so on), brought in more than $9bn of revenue – more than twice as much as Gap itself. Gap is now in the midst of a three-year turnaround plan, unveiled in 2020 by its CEO Sonia Syngal. By 2023, Syngal hopes that Gap will represent a smaller portion of Gap Inc’s overall business but will be profitable. That has meant cost-cutting: closing stores, moving out of malls and shifting to a franchise business in the UK and Europe. It has also involved design changes. While Gap is focusing on its most successful categories – denim, activewear, fleeces and knitwear – it grabbed headlines in June 2020 when it announced a 10-year collaboration deal with Yeezy, the influential fashion brand run by the artist formerly known as Kanye West, who recently changed his name to Ye. There are some signs that Gap is moving in the right direction. Sales in North America were up in 2021, prompting Gap Inc, in its most recent annual report, to declare its namesake brand “cool and relevant again”. Still, for all the TikTokers buying logo hoodies and Ye fans snapping up Yeezy Gap, the retail experts I spoke with were not optimistic about the brand’s future. One problem that kept coming up was Gap’s lack of any clear identity, a crucial factor in the long-term success of any clothing brand. “I think for years, the challenge has been that there has been no clear point of difference for Gap,” said Allen Adamson, a co-founder of the retail consultancy Metaforce. Gap’s squishy new tagline, Modern American Optimism, doesn’t offer much help. (Nor do vague words of encouragement feel especially meaningful at this less-than-sunny moment in US history.) These identity questions remained hazy even after I received an emailed statement from Gap laying out its intention to both “provide something for everyone at every stage of their life”, and to focus on capturing millennial and gen Z customers. When it first hit the scene in the late 60s, Gap was speaking to a generation of young people. Today, the brand faces the challenge of clarifying a message that has grown blurry. As people who spend too much time on social media know, gen Z likes to make fun of boomers, but it has that generation to thank for Gap’s ascendance. The first Gap store opened in 1969 in San Francisco, the hotbed of the hippy movement, and it sold records, and blue jeans made by Levi Strauss, a company based in the same city that had been producing denim since 1853. The story goes that Gap’s founder, a then-41-year-old real-estate businessman named Donald Fisher, accidentally ordered a pair of Levi’s in the wrong size and couldn’t find a local store where he could exchange them for the right one, so he decided to open a store that carried the brand in a suitably large range of sizes. While the idea for the store catered to Fisher’s own needs, it spoke directly to the generation that followed his: baby boomers, who were in their early 20s when “The Gap” – so named for the generation gap between that cohort and their parents – opened its doors. Baby boomers were eager adopters of blue jeans as everyday clothes, and Gap had blue jeans to spare. Thanks to its sturdy construction, denim was originally worn by farmers, miners and industrial workers, but in the mid-20th century, it became the perfect uniform for young people interested in rejecting social hierarchies. On American college campuses in 1960, you would have found young men wearing blazers, ties and corduroys and young women in wool tweed skirts and sweaters, said Regina Blaszczyk, a professor of business history at the University of Leeds. But, she continued, “By the end of the decade, they’re wearing jeans.” And by the 1970s, this look, like other elements of the counterculture, had gone mainstream. Riding the denim craze, Gap expanded across the country, launching its own Gap label to sell alongside Levi’s jeans, and went public in 1976. (Fisher phased out selling records early on, when it became apparent that jeans were a much bigger draw.) But because Gap relied on Levi’s so heavily, it was vulnerable to the other company’s fortunes. After the Federal Trade Commission accused Levi’s of price-fixing in 1976, Gap missed its target stock price at IPO. When that ruling gave other retailers permission to mark down Levi’s goods, Gap faced pressure to drop its own prices to remain competitive. “It became a big enough problem that Gap strategically felt they had to migrate away from Levi’s,” said Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, who worked for Fisher in the late 70s. Gap tried new ideas – Cohen worked on a short-lived brand called Logo, which catered to an older audience that couldn’t wear jeans to work (Cohen describes it as “kind of a precursor to Banana Republic”) – and introduced a wider variety of clothing to its stores, but it had little success. Then, in 1983, Fisher made a brilliant move. Seeing how well the women’s clothing chain Ann Taylor was performing, he decided to hire the person behind its success. That was Millard “Mickey” Drexler, who went on to turn Gap into a global juggernaut. Drexler left Ann Taylor on a Friday, flew to San Francisco over the weekend and started his new job as president of Gap on the Monday. “It was a business without taste or style, or a point of view,” Drexler told me. He planned to make colour a cornerstone of Gap’s sensibility and pare down the number of styles it sold. He planned to give it an identity. If you don’t know Drexler’s name, you certainly know his work. After nearly 20 years at Gap, he moved to J Crew, the US’s foremost purveyor of preppy New England style, turning it into a hit machine favoured by Michelle Obama and Gwyneth Paltrow. As an Apple board member, a role he occupied from 1999 to 2015, he also helped Steve Jobs design the concept for the brand’s clean, minimalist stores. A native New Yorker, Drexler approaches conversations like a voluble, hyper-focused whirlwind and in the business world, he has a reputation for being a merchandising genius. Put simply, he knows what people are going to want to wear, how much of it to buy and how to price it. “You kind of have an emotional thermometer inside you,” Drexler told me over the phone. “If you don’t have that, you can’t do this business well.” When he arrived at Gap, Drexler started liquidating the company’s inventory, marking down prices to clear. This is a common way for retailers to get rid of dead weight, but the process was terrifying to Drexler. It was his first time working at a public company, and its earnings and stock price were plummeting. “I’m scared shitless inside,” said Drexler, recalling that period of his life. He’d come home at night to his wife, Peggy, and wonder what on earth he was doing at Gap. Drexler’s strategy was to introduce a line of casual, classic, affordable clothing suited to the middle class baby boomers who were now establishing themselves in their careers and starting families. Under Drexler, Gap found hits in items like its jeans, fleeces and 10-button henley shirts. As he had planned, bold, crisp colour became its calling card. Gap polo shirts were not just blue, black or white; they now came in fuchsia, red and jade green, too. Gap sold the building blocks of unfussy American style, and it sold them to everyone. At the time, most other clothing retailers thought about their customers in rigid terms, dividing stores up according to age groups and price categories. Drexler “just crashed through all of that”, said the former Harper’s Bazaar editor Kate Betts, who worked in Paris as a fashion reporter for the trade publication Women’s Wear Daily during the late 80s. At Gap, where the lines blurred between men’s and women’s clothing, everyone could get in on the look – not just baby boomers, but their kids, too. Drexler’s plan took more than a year to start showing results, but when it did, as he immodestly puts it, the brand took off like a rocket. Between 1984 and 1985, Gap Inc’s annual revenue jumped from $518m to $647m. By 1990, sales had reached $1.93bn. At that point Gap really did, as it is hoping to do today, provide something for everyone. Drexler’s Gap was born into a golden age of American retail. In the 80s, suburban malls were booming, having become a hangout spot for teenagers, who flocked to their buffets of chain stores, food courts, and movie theatres. Specialty apparel stores, the retail category to which Gap belongs, started to dominate. Gap wasn’t merely riding that wave: “It definitely led the way,” said Steven Goldberg, a retail veteran who heads the consulting firm SGG & Associates. Today, you can’t go online without bumping into a brand selling casual basics, from Uniqlo to the five different no-name brands that keep advertising “the perfect tank top” on your Instagram feed. In the 80s, though, the revamped Gap had little competition. When I asked Cohen, the Columbia Business School professor, who it was going up against, he answered with one word: “Nobody”. Gap clothes struck a balance of being stylish but not intimidating, affordable but good quality. The brand fit with an increasingly relaxed clothes culture, and when many American workplaces adopted the practice of “Casual Fridays” in the 90s, Gap was right there with an armful of khakis. Gap had found its point of view, and it was Drexler’s. “Mickey was the north star. There’s no question,” said Jen Foyle, the president and executive creative director of the clothing brand American Eagle and its offshoot Aerie, who worked as a Gap merchant in the late 90s and early 00s. Over the course of his career, Drexler has been known for his hands-on approach. At Gap, the lead-up to what Foyle calls “Mickey meetings”, in which each merchant would present the buys for their department or division, came with a rush of adrenaline. Everyone was paying attention to what he did and didn’t respond to, who performed well and who didn’t. “When he stayed on a product for a minute, you knew there was something not right about it, or the buy wasn’t right, or something was mis-ranked,” said Foyle. In the 80s, Gap’s sense of identity was clear to shoppers, too. “Gap was so pure and simple,” said Scott Sternberg, a fashion designer who looked to that era of Gap as a source of inspiration when launching his own colourful essentials brand, Entireworld, in 2018. Sternberg is 47 and grew up in Dayton, Ohio, where he used to go to the Gap store in the local mall. It was a one-stop shop where he would buy everything from khakis and jeans to T-shirts and socks. Sternberg feels that Drexler’s Gap allowed shoppers to build a cohesive wardrobe over time, creating a utopian order where the products were all compatible, regardless of when you bought them. During this period, Gap was selling the notion that its classics were for everyone, but that each person wore them in their own way – an ethos that dovetailed with changing tastes in the fashion world. “The idea of ‘personal style’ was becoming a huge catchphrase in the fashion industry at that time,” said Betts, who remembers seeing the term on magazine covers when she went to work at Vogue in 1991. Previously, people who wore designer clothing tended to dress in a single brand from head to toe, but heading into the 90s, designers and editors started favouring a more individualised “high-low” look, mixing designer pieces with blue jeans or a T-shirt. On Anna Wintour’s first cover as editor-in-chief of Vogue in 1988, the model Michaela Bercu wore an embroidered Christian Lacroix haute couture jacket with a pair of Guess jeans. Not everyone had the means to wear their Gap jeans with a designer jacket, of course, but the simplicity of the brand’s clothing meant that it was versatile enough to be incorporated into any number of looks. “The secret power of Gap is that the product was meant to be a person’s own,” said Trey Laird, an advertising executive hired by Drexler in 2001 to work on Gap’s ads. “If you were walking down the street, nobody would stop you and be like, ‘Oh my God, you’re wearing the Gap skinny black pants!’ They were your black pants.” Gap made this message clear in its 1988 “Individuals of Style” advertising campaign, which became the blueprint for many of its later ads. Shot by the biggest names in fashion photography, such as Patrick Demarchelier and Annie Leibovitz, the ongoing campaign featured black and white images of celebrities wearing Gap. Spike Lee in a mock neck and khakis, Whoopi Goldberg in a hooded sweatshirt, Joan Didion and her daughter Quintana Roo in turtlenecks. The photos were simple and elegant. The stars really did look as if they were wearing their own clothes, in their own way. “I remember thinking that it was just so cool,” said Betts. “You’d never seen that kind of stylised campaign on a mass market level before.” Over the years, everyone from Willie Nelson and Lucy Liu to Mikhail Baryshnikov and Amy Poehler appeared in ads for the brand. To sit for a Gap ad became almost a rite of passage. Working with Hollywood stars is now an obvious move for every brand that can afford it, but for a period of time, as Sternberg said, “They owned celebrity.” Gap found a way to make the idea of wearing the same clothes as everyone else seem cool. In 1999, the brand released a trio of low-key but iconic TV commercials. In one, a group of people wearing muted shades of blue and gray sat on a white set and sang portions of the Donovan song Mellow Yellow as the camera panned around the room. While some of the cast would later go on to become famous – you can spot a young Rashida Jones in the group – nobody stood out, as such. The commercials were about being part of the group, recalled the ad’s director Pedro Romhanyi. “I think one of the reasons Gap was so successful is that it appealed to people who wanted to look stylish in the crowd, rather than stand out from the crowd,” he said. When these ads came out, Gap was ubiquitous. In 1999, it had more than 2,000 stores around the world, and Gap Inc’s sales had reached $11.6bn. But competitors were closing in on Gap’s previously unchallenged position in the market. Department stores had started selling jeans, khakis, and casual tops, too, and discount clothing stores like TJ Maxx, Ross and Marshalls were on the rise. To compete with these lower-priced stores, Drexler had launched Old Navy in 1994, an upbeat alternative to drab discount stores. It was an enormous success – in 1995, Fisher named Drexler CEO, while he remained at the company as board chair – but it didn’t help Gap’s position. After two years of sinking sales, in 2002, Drexler was out. The slump that preceded Drexler’s departure was, at least partly, the result of product misfires. European fast fashion brands were taking off in the US – H&M opened its first US store in New York in 2000 – and the Gap team got spooked, turning their focus to trendy clothing rather than the classic items it was known for. (News articles on Drexler leaving cited “hip-huggers” and “orchid leather pants and crocheted halter tops” as examples of Gap’s misguided attempts at more fashion-centric items.) “We just went in the wrong direction,” said Foyle. “Now, from my heart, I’m always like, brand first, brand first. It’s the best lesson I’ve ever learned.” Having realised the brand’s error, Foyle remembers going through every clothing category and identifying the key items that had performed well for Gap in the past – a process not unlike the one Gap says it is undertaking now. “We really just went back to our roots,” Foyle said. Sales did pop back up in 2003 and 2004. The following year, they began a decline that has continued, almost uninterrupted, until the present day. Gap’s fall during the 00s and 10s stems from problems much bigger than hip-huggers. Chief among them is overexpansion. In the 80s and 90s, Gap had piled up revenue by opening thousands of new stores. This strategy was standard at the time. “The market demanded that you open more doors,” said Doug Stephens, a retail consultant based in Canada. “It wasn’t even a choice that most companies had. In every earnings report, investors wanted to see how many new doors you had.” By the early 00s, it was clear that Gap had gone too far. (“The hardest thing for a brand to do is maintain what makes them special and yet sell to the entirety of the world,” said retail analyst Simeon Siegel, noting that Nike may be the only apparel retailer in the US currently managing that.) For any brand of that size, it’s a challenge to train so many new staff and keep tabs on how stores were doing, while preventing newly opened stores from siphoning sales away from established locations. Could retailers like Gap have foreseen these problems? Cohen believes so. “It was a train wreck that could be seen at the end of a long tunnel, but nobody was acting on it,” he told me. What they might not have been able to anticipate was the rise of e-commerce. As consumers have moved their shopping habits online in recent years, numerous once-mighty American department stores and popular mall brands have crumbled under the weight of their massive property portfolios – a problem that has only got worse during the pandemic. The British high street has undergone its own meltdown during Covid, with Topshop owner Arcadia Group entering administration and Marks & Spencer accelerating store closures. Besides its excessive number of stores, Gap’s offering – classic clothing for middle-class customers – no longer fitted the moment. As wealth inequality in the US grew, discount retailers TJ Maxx and Ross continued to prosper, and fast fashion brands like Forever 21, H&M and Zara drew away shoppers with their inexpensive, runway-inspired clothing. “I think that by the early 2000s, the writing was on the wall: if you’re a mid-tier brand looking for middle-class consumers, you’re going to have an increasingly difficult time,” said Stephens. Throughout the 00s and 10s, Gap flailed around trying to rediscover its identity. From Cohen’s perspective, the three CEOs who followed Drexler – Paul Pressler, who came from Disney parks and resorts; Glenn Murphy, who came from Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada; and Art Peck, a former consultant who spent 10 years at Gap Inc under Murphy – didn’t have the experience or merchandising skills to reposition Gap’s business. Buzzy creative directors came and went, without rejuvenating the brand in a lasting way. All the while, Gap was losing customers. “They didn’t stand for anything any more, and the customer was confused,” said retail analyst Janet Kloppenburg. Gap failed to secure the loyalty of millennials, many of whom had grown up shopping at Gap with their baby boomer parents and may still have fond memories of the logo sweatshirts and jeans that they saw in its stores. I do. When I think about the Gap of my 90s childhood, I see a store that’s bright and clean, full of richly coloured sweaters, full of the transformative possibility that I felt every time I went to the mall. But Gap didn’t grow up with millennials, and it lost out to the cooler, sexier mall brands vying for their attention, like Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle and Aeropostale. The company was created for one generation gap but failed to bridge the next. Which brings us to Kanye. By far the juiciest aspect of Gap’s current turnaround plan is its Yeezy collaboration. Since it was announced two years ago, only a small selection of items have been made available – including puffy bolero jackets and hoodies – and reports have emerged that Gap is displeased with the slow rollout from Ye and his creative team. Still, the reaction from West’s fans has been frenzied. The first Yeezy Gap hoodie retailed for $90 but according to the industry website Business of Fashion, it quickly began selling at 50% above its original price on StockX, a resale site, with the hard-to-find black version of the hoodie going for as much as $899. On YouTube, reviewers gave forensic analyses of the hoodie, discussing everything from the quality of the seams to the fall of the hood. At the start of this year, Ye announced a collaboration-within-a-collaboration with the high fashion brand Balenciaga, whose creative director, Demna, is a close friend of his. (Like Ye, the designer recently dropped his last name, which is Gvasalia.) The announcement of Gap’s 10-year deal with Ye made a splash, in part because it was a far more substantial commitment than most designer collaborations. Ye has long been a vocal fan of Gap, where he worked as a store employee during his teens. In 2015, he declared that one of his dreams was to be creative director of the brand – “the Steve Jobs of Gap”. Meanwhile, Gap has a lot to gain by tapping into Ye’s cultural capital and fan following, which drove the success of his earlier collaboration with Adidas. According to the New York Times, Gap believes it can reach $1bn in sales from Yeezy Gap by the five-year mark. That’s assuming, of course, that we see more products. It’s hard to overstate the sway that Ye has over the fashion choices of a certain slice of the population – namely, “young men on the internet, and older men trying to retain their youth,” says James Harris, who co-hosts the menswear podcast Throwing Fits. Certain silhouettes that have become popular in menswear can be traced back directly to Ye. Around the time he released his album Watch the Throne, he went for extra-long T-shirts – their length sometimes exaggerated with the addition of a leather skirt – worn with skinny pants and chunky sneakers. Currently, Ye is all about vintage jeans tucked into huge boots, worn with a hoodie or jacket that is cropped, boxy, and bulky, with exaggerated shoulders. Harris dropped a movie poster for 1999’s The Iron Giant in our Zoom chat to show what he meant. This might explain why, when journalistic dedication compelled me to buy a red version of the Yeezy Gap hoodie, I got the impression that I was dressed up as Ye himself. The double-layered cotton sweatshirt is remarkably heavy, almost like a weighted blanket, and while it bears no external logos, it has a distinctive shape: a dropped shoulder, a loose arm, a cropped but oversized fit. Very Iron Giant. Unlike the Gap black skinny pants that simply become your pants, this sweatshirt is the kind of product that might actually elicit comments on the street. It’s not your hoodie, it’s Ye’s hoodie. After a few weeks of debating whether I could pull off wearing the sweatshirt without looking like I was trying to be younger and hipper than I am, I decided to return it. The thought of young Yeezy fans clocking it on the street made me feel old. (I’m 30.) Drawing in younger shoppers is an existential matter for Gap. “As consumers get older, they shop less,” said Kloppenburg. It’s not clear that Yeezy Gap is going to convert Ye fans into Gap customers, though. Shoppers can order the products through a dedicated Yeezy Gap website. “This collaboration is good for Kanye and it’s good for Kanye fans, because he can now produce and distribute at scale and at a price point that’s friendlier to people who don’t want to pay for luxury items,” Harris said. He was less certain that it would do much good for Gap. A number of retail experts with whom I spoke were baffled by Gap’s discordant product output, which includes not only Yeezy Gap but also a home goods collaboration with Walmart. “I come back to the question: Who are you?” said Stephens. “What do you stand for as a brand? And what can consumers look to you for?” Within the nascent microcosm of Yeezy Gap, the parent organisation has finally gained access to something it hasn’t had in decades: a point of view. In the same way that Gap’s identity flowed directly from Drexler during the 80s, Yeezy Gap is all about Ye’s singular sensibility. But that sensibility is imported, forged outside Gap’s walls and well before this deal was signed. Ye’s fans will follow him wherever he goes, and when he eventually parts ways with Gap, you have to wonder what will be left behind.

4/5/2022,"The influential sister of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has said the country’s nuclear forces would “annihilate” the South Korean military if it launched a pre-emptive strike against the regime. Kim Yo-jong, who holds several senior positions in the government and ruling party, said the North had no intention of starting a second Korean war, but would respond if provoked and leave the South’s military in a state of “total destruction and ruin”. Her comments after South Korea’s defence minister, Suh Wook, publicly discussed Seoul’s ability to “accurately and quickly hit any target in North Korea” with a range of weapons, as international unease grows over the North’s recent resumption of long-range missile tests. In another statement directed toward Suh on Sunday, she called him a “scum-like guy”. Kim Yo-jong’s warning, while not unusual in its vivid use of language, points to a rise in tensions on the peninsula after the North last month conducted its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile for five years, and amid speculation that the regime could be preparing to carry out a nuclear test later this month. In her second statement in the space of a few days, Kim said Pyongyang opposed war and did not view South Korea as its principal enemy. “In other words, it means that unless the South Korean army takes military action against our state, it will not be regarded as a target,” she said. “But if South Korea, for any reason – whether or not it is blinded by misjudgment – opts for such military action as ‘preemptive strike’ touted by (Suh Wook), the situation will change. In that case, South Korea itself will become a target.” The South, she added, could avoid that fate by abandoning its “fantastic daydream” of launching an attack on the North, a nuclear-armed state whose arsenal could include nuclear-capable short-range weapons targeting South Korean conventional forces and 28,500 US troops based in the country. North Korea has attempted to increase pressure on Seoul just weeks before South Korea’s new president, the conservative Yoon Suk-yeol, replaces the liberal Moon Jae-in, who has little to show for his attempts at rapprochement with Pyongyang. Moon met Kim Jong-un three times in 2018 and lobbied hard to set up the North Korean leader’s first summit with Donald Trump in June that year. A second Trump-Kim summit in 2019 ended in failure due to disagreements on sanctions relief, and the Biden administration has shown little interest in reviving denuclearisation talks unless they result in the verifiable dismantling of the North’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. Yoon, who will be sworn in 9 May, has vowed to strengthen the South’s defences against North Korean missile attacks but has not ruled out a return to dialogue with Kim. Yoon’s foreign policy and security advisers are in the US to discuss an early summit with Joe Biden amid concern in Seoul that the US president’s focus is exclusively on the war in Ukraine. Some analysts believe the North will continue to increase pressure on Washington in the coming months, possibly by test-flying missiles over Japan or resuming nuclear tests. A major provocation could come on or about 15 April, the 110th anniversary of the birth of North Korea’s founder – and Kim Jong-un’s grandfather – Kim Il-sung.",News/World news,"North Korea would ‘annihilate’ South if provoked, warns Kim Jong-un’s sister",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/north-korea-would-annihilate-south-if-provoked-warns-kim-jong-uns-sister
