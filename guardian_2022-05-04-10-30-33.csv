5/4/2022,"A man was arrested in San Francisco on Tuesday after free-climbing the Salesforce tower, in a stunt apparently indented as a protest against abortion. The man, who calls himself the “pro-life Spiderman”, was reportedly arrested on Tuesday afternoon. The city’s fire department confirmed the incident on Twitter and encouraged the public to “join us in condemning this action”. Footage posted to social media from inside and outside the tower showed the man climbing the office skyscraper without safety gear. He was reportedly met by authorities at the top and swiftly taken into custody.

The activist apparently sought to protest a specific abortion provider, according to posts on his personal Instagram. He has gone to similarly extreme measures to draw attention to other rightwing causes in the past, including climbing the 600ft Aria hotel in August to protest Covid-19 mandates in the state. The stunt came a day after a leaked draft opinion revealed that the US supreme court is poised to overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark decision guaranteeing the right to an abortion. The unprecedented leak has sparked widespread protests across the US, with both pro-choice advocates and anti-abortion advocates gathering outside the supreme court in Washington DC and in cities across the country, including Nashville, Dallas, New York City and New Orleans.",News/US news,‘Pro-life Spiderman’: anti-abortion activist climbs San Francisco’s tallest building,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/03/san-francisco-salesforce-tower-free-climb-abortion
5/4/2022,"Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed 156 people who were successfully evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol arrived in Zaporizhzhia on Tuesday.“Today 156 people arrived in Zaporizhzhia. Women and children. They have been in shelters for more than two months,” he said. Another 200 civilians are still trapped under the complex and approximately 100,000 remain in the city, Mariupol’s mayor, Vadym Boichenko, said. Russian troops continued to shell and attempted to storm the Azovstal steelworks in violation of ceasefire agreements, the president said. Russian attacks in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region killed 21 civilians and injured 27 on Tuesday, according to the regional governor. In a Telegram post, Pavlo Kyrylenko said it was the highest daily death toll in the region since an assault on a railway station in the town of Kramatorsk, which killed 50 people last month. Power substations in Lviv were hit by Russian missiles on Tuesday evening, according to the city’s mayor. The strike reportedly injured one person, Andriy Sadovyi said. The EU sanctions intent on breaking “the Russian war machine” are now imminent, the president of the European Council has said. A proposal to phase in a prohibition on Russian oil imports will be discussed by member state ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday, with the most dependent, such as Slovakia and Hungary, seeking exemptions. EU officials handed over a draft sanctions plan to member states late on Tuesday, but divisions in the legally and diplomatically fraught negotiations continue as some member states seek sanctions opt-outs. UK prime minister Boris Johnson said “Ukraine will win” against Russia and “will be free” in an address to the Ukrainian parliament virtually on Tuesday. Johnson was the first world leader to address the Verkhovna Rada since the conflict began. Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, has passed a law that bans political parties that justify, recognise or deny Russia’s armed aggression against Ukraine. The law will also ban parties who glorify or justify the actions of those carrying out armed aggression against Ukraine. Russian president Vladimir Putin told France’s president Emmanuel Macron that “western countries could help stop the crimes of the Ukrainian military”. Putin is also reported to have told Macron about the Russian approach to negotiations with Kyiv. Putin also signed a decree on retaliatory economic sanctions against the west. According to Reuters, the sanctions are in response to the “unfriendly actions of certain foreign states and international organisations”, the Kremlin said on Tuesday. The names of individuals or entities affected by the measures are not included on the document. Germany’s opposition leader travelled to Kyiv to meet Ukrainian officials, after the country’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, made clear he would not be visiting Ukraine any time soon. Moscow accused Israel of backing the “neo-Nazi regime in Kyiv”. The remarks are the latest in Russia’s diplomatic row with Israel, after the Kremlin’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Monday that Adolf Hitler “had Jewish blood”. US president Joe Biden visited a factory in Troy, Alabama, where arms manufacturer Lockheed Martin makes anti-tank Javelin missiles. He lauded the “rapid pace” of military equipment and aid from the US to Ukraine in the two months since Russia initiated the war. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is inflicting damage to the country’s infrastructure at a cost of $4.5bn (£3.6bn) a week. According to estimates compiled by the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE), the damage has reached $92bn since the invasion began in February. Men and boys are among the alleged victims of rape by Russian soldiers in Ukraine, where dozens of cases of sexual violence by the invading forces are already under investigation, UN and Ukrainian officials said on Tuesday. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, accused Russia of using rape as a war tactic, and described president Vladimir Putin as “the main war criminal of the 21st century”. Pope Francis has said he requested a meeting Putin over Ukraine and compared the scale of the bloodshed to Rwanda’s genocide. Questioning the conflict’s causes, the pope spoke of an “anger” in the Kremlin which could have been “facilitated” by “the barking of Nato at Russia’s door”.

5/4/2022,"Attorneys for Johnny Depp rested their case on Tuesday after 13 days of searing testimony in the actor’s $50m defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife, actor Amber Heard. In court in Virginia, Heard’s attorneys then demanded the judge dismiss the action – before following on from Depp’s witnesses with a psychologist’s description of his alleged psychological and violent domestic abuse against her. Without jurors present, lawyer Ben Rottenborn asked the judge, Penney Azcarate, “to strike the plaintiff’s evidence and award summary judgment in whole or in part to Ms Heard”. Rottenborn argued that Depp abused Amber in “non-physical” ways, citing alleged evidence of emotional, mental and psychological abuse presented in recordings and “menacing statements”, outside disputed incidents of violence. The petition to dismiss was largely procedural. After hearing counter-arguments from Depp’s counsel, Azcarate ruled the trial would proceed. Heard’s first witness, an expert in interpersonal violence, offered a graphic description of Johnny Depp’s alleged violence against his former wife, telling jurors in the dueling defamation case that Heard suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of “intimate partner violence by Mr Depp”. Dawn Hughes, Amber Heard’s first witness in her defense of Depp’s libel claim, has told the court in Virginia that she conducted an “objective evaluation” of Heard over 21 hours, and consulted medical records, psychological treatment notes, deposition testimony in the UK libel case and Heard’s mother. Heard demonstrated “clear symptoms” consistent with interpersonal violence “characterized by physical violence, psychological aggression, sexual violence, coercive control and surveillance”. Depp’s alleged abuse of Heard “was pushing the symptoms, related to the intrusive phenomenon, related to her avoidance, her differences in her mood”, Hughes said. She rejected claims that Heard had likely feigned symptoms of PTSD, as offered by Depp’s witness, Shannon Curry. Hughes testified that Heard was abused by her father and watched her parents struggle with substance abuse. “She learned from an early age how to caretake, how to live in a situation mired in chaos, to take care of a parent who has nodded out from heroin. She learned from a very early age how to figure that out,” Hughes said. “That environment taught her that she could love someone who hurts her. She learned how to have this tolerance for cognitive inconsistency, for two what should be diametrically opposed emotions.” As she had tried to do with her parents, Heard “truly believed she could fix Mr Depp and rid him of his substance abuse problems”. Heard bowed her head during parts of Hughes’ testimony. The psychologist, who has testified in the trials of R Kelly and Nxivm cult leader Keith Raniere, earlier testified that writing messages could be considered emotional abuse, likely a reference to messages scrawled on the walls of the house they shared in Australia after Depp’s finger was cut during a March 2015 fight. Hughes testified that Depp was obsessively jealous, interrogating and resorted to obsessive control of Heard. He was “obsessed with infidelity” and called leading men or directors she worked with to warn them he “had eyes” on them. Heard adapted to the threat by toning down what she wore to “mom jeans” style, the court heard. Depp tried to control what she wore when she was not with him, the jury was told. He’d read her scripts to check for love scenes and constantly accused her of infidelity. “She had to try to conceal and maneuver around him to try to have the career she wanted,” Hughes said. Hughes said Depp was “obsessively jealous” of James Franco, that Heard was sometimes “afraid to go home” when Depp was high on drugs or had been drinking. On a 2015 Boston to Los Angeles flight, Hughes said, Depp “starts talking about James Franco” to Heard, saying: ‘Hope you had fun with your escapades’. He kicked her on the back and she went forward … ” The psychologist also said Depp railed about Heard and actor Billy Bob Thornton. The majority of Depp’s violent and sexually violent episodes were in “these alcohol and drug-fueled rages”, Hughes testified. Hughes described Depp and Heard’s “highly-volatile, highly-damaging” relationship. “When Mr Depp was drunk or high he threw her on a bed, ripped off her nightgown, and tried to have sex with her. There were times when he “forced her to give him oral sex when he was angry” or in “moments of dominance of him trying to get control over her”. In one incident, Hughes said, Depp accused Heard of being flirted with by another woman and he performed a forcible cavity search on Heard “ostensibly looking for drugs”. While the couple was visiting Australia, she said, Heard was subjected to one of the most severe episodes of sexual violence in the course of the couple’s 15-month marriage. “When he was beating her and choking her and telling her ‘I’m going to fucking kill you, I hate you, I hate you’, he grabbed a bottle off the bar and penetrated her with that bottle. Miss Heard reported to me of disassociating and ‘going outside of her body’. The only thing she was thinking was, ‘Oh God, I hope it’s not the broken one’ [bottle],” Hughes told the court. At the closing of Depp’s attorney’s presentation to the court earlier on Tuesday, Erin Falati, Heard’s nurse, appeared via pre-recorded video, telling the court Heard said she had issues with cocaine and alcohol and struggled with jealousy, anxiety and co-dependency in relationships, including that with Depp. “I recall a general sense of discord in the relationship … disagreements, reconciliation and kind of that repeating pattern,” Falati said. Heard’s coping skills, the court was told, involved “compulsive anger and yelling”. A note from Falati displayed in court showed an instance when she saw Heard bleeding from her lip, allegedly after an altercation with Depp. Depp’s final witness, the forensic accountant Mike Spindler, estimated that Depp lost $40m in earnings as a result of Heard’s Washington Post article in which she described herself as a survivor of domestic abuse. The trial continues.  In the US, the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233). In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women’s Aid.

5/4/2022,"Scott Morrison has ratcheted up his warnings against a powerful national anti-corruption commission, arguing handing control over to “faceless officials” could turn Australia into “some kind of public autocracy”. Amid growing political pressure on the Coalition over its failure to meet its previous election promise to legislate a commonwealth integrity commission, the prime minister told the Nine newspapers politicians were accountable to voters at elections. He argued elected members should be able to allocate funding for infrastructure and community grants and without undue fear of public servants investigating those decisions. Labor, which has promised to establish a national anti-corruption commission “with teeth” by the end of the year if it wins the 21 May election, said the comments showed Morrison’s “true colours are emerging now”. The government is also facing pressure from “teal independents” who have placed an integrity commission alongside climate action at the centre of their campaigns to unseat Liberal MPs. The Liberal premier of New South Wales, Dominic Perrottet, said on Tuesday that Morrison “absolutely” went too far in describing his state’s anti-corruption watchdog as a “kangaroo court”. In the new interview, published on Wednesday, Morrison played down the prospect of a compromise in the next term of parliament. He argued the government’s draft legislation – which he never introduced into the parliament for debate – was “very good”. The prime minister said he understood why people wanted such a body at a federal level, but he also argued that if it were designed poorly “it could cause a lot of damage”. The prime minister said he was “trying to prevent a massive mistake”. “The unintended consequences of an ill-thought-through integrity commission, I think are very dangerous,” Morrison said in the interview with the Nine newspapers. “If we are going to so disempower our elected representatives to do things about what is needed in their communities, then what is the point?” Morrison continued to argue that a new commission should focus on criminality rather than accusations of pork-barrelling. “We can’t just hand government over to faceless officials to make decisions that impact the lives of Australians from one end of the country to the other. I actually think there’s a great danger in that,” Morrison told the papers. “It wouldn’t be Australia any more if that was the case, it would be some kind of public autocracy.” The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said Morrison’s latest comments showed the prime minister was never serious about legislating an anti-corruption commission. “His true colours are emerging now,” Chalmers told ABC Radio National on Wednesday. “This is what he really thinks and he’s been lying about wanting a national anti-corruption commission this whole time. The only way to get one is to support Labor at the election on 21 May.” The federal government’s proposed model, which was released as an exposure draft, was widely condemned as weak. It had no ability to conduct public hearings for government corruption, despite allowing such hearings for law enforcement matters, and sets a very high bar for investigations to commence. Morrison is a longstanding critic of the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) over its investigation into the former NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian’s secret relationship with MP Daryl Maguire and her alleged failure to declare a conflict while involved in grants for his electorate of Wagga Wagga. Berejiklian has denied any wrongdoing and Icac is yet to hand down its findings. After the NSW Icac commissioner, Stephen Rushton, described critics who used the “kangaroo court” term, including the prime minister, as “buffoons” at an parliament inquiry on Monday, Perrottet used a press conference on Tuesday to throw his support behind the watchdog. Perrottet said the Icac “plays an important role in upholding integrity and confidence in politicians and in public servants in our state”. The premier underlined the need to raise any concerns “in a way that doesn’t undermine confidence in our integrity agencies”.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison warns overly powerful Icac could turn Australia into ‘public autocracy’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/04/scott-morrison-warns-overly-powerful-icac-could-turn-australia-into-public-autocracy
5/4/2022,"The cost of household goods such as toys, furniture and clothing is rising by the fastest rate in more than 15 years as the impact of the war in Ukraine combines with Covid lockdowns in China. Non-food inflation accelerated to 2.2% in April, up from 1.5% in March, according to the latest shop price index from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and market research group NielsenIQ, the highest rate since the monitor began in 2006. Food inflation rose to 3.5% in April – from 3.3% in March – making it the highest such figure on the index since March 2013, as the price of energy and commodities, including wheat and oil, drove up costs for many producers. The inflation is intensifying existing pressures on the cost of living, including last month’s energy cap increase that pushed the average electricity and gas bill up by £700 a year. The cost of petrol has also shot up, while household budgets arealready under pressure after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, raised national insurance contributions. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, which represents most of the major UK retailers, said furniture, electrical goods and books were seeing particularly high price increases as disruption caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine added to rising energy prices. It is understood that flooring, stationery and DIY materials, including paint, which are all heavily imported from China where many large cities have been shut down as part of strict anti-Covid measures, are also seeing high cost increases. “This [inflation] has been exacerbated by disruption at the world’s largest seaport, following Shanghai’s recent lockdown,” Dickinson said. “Food prices continued to rise, though fresh food inflation slowed as fierce competition between supermarkets resisted price hikes on many everyday essentials.” The BRC’s comments follow a warning from non-food retailers that sales have been hit by supply difficulties and weakening demand. The biggest squeeze on living standards since the 1950s has made consumers more gloomy about their finances and far less willing to spend in the shops. Sainsbury’s, the owner of the Argos chain, flagged problems with items such as TVs and consumer electronics made in China. The retailer said it expected the supply chain difficulties in east Asia – and a squeeze on customers’ spare cash caused by rising energy, petrol and food bills – to lead to lower sales of such items. Shares in the household appliance specialist AO World fell by more than a fifth last week as it said consumer demand for electrical goods had “progressively weakened”. Households are paring back spending on large non-essential items as the average household faces potential grocery price increases of £271 a year, according to the latest data from market research firm Kantar. It said shoppers had begun stockpiling some goods, such as sunflower oil, amid concerns about price rises and potential shortages. Meanwhile, the rise in the cost of living is expected to drive a surge in personal borrowing. Demand for credit from UK households is expected to rise to a five-year high of 7.9% – or about £16bn – in 2022, according to the latest EY Item Club UK bank lending forecast, as consumers increasingly turn to credit cards to cover bills. The rise would mark a reverse in trends from the first phase of the pandemic when many people paid down personal debts with nearly £200bn in extra cash saved – mostly by wealthier households – because of restrictions on travel, socialising and visiting high street shops. However, EY predicted demand for unsecured loans would diminish as households are likely to cut spending on discretionary purchases and big-ticket items, such as sofas and household appliances,to save money for essentials. Growth in mortgage lending is also expected to decline from 4.3% last year to 3.8% this year and 3.3% next – to £59.4bn and £53.5bn in 2022 and 2023 – amid rising interest rates and growing cost of living pressures.",News/Business,Ukraine war and China lockdowns drive fastest UK price rises in years,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/ukraine-war-china-lockdowns-fastest-uk-price-rises-years
5/4/2022,"Inequality in Britain risks being driven up by the biggest boom in City bonuses and pay since the 2008 financial crisis, the country’s leading economics thinktank has warned. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the return of bumper finance industry payouts meant the top 1% highest-paid workers were beginning to pull further away from the rest of the UK workforce despite the cost of living crisis hitting the country at large. Suggesting that City bankers would be better insulated than most from the soaring cost of living, the thinktank said pay and bonus deals in the Square Mile had shot up in recent months and had risen by about twice as much as other sectors in the past two years. According to the report, the mean monthly pay packet in the finance sector in February was 31% higher than in December 2019 in cash terms, compared with 14% across all sectors. Pay growth was driven by high earners, reflected in the higher mean figure. However, median pay in the finance industry was also significantly higher than for the economy at large. The IFS said City bankers, fund managers and other finance workers accounted for almost a third of all employees in the top 1% income bracket, meaning that a bumper period for this group would lift them further ahead of everyone else. The IFS said this was in contrast with the trend from 2016 to 2020, when low earners saw the strongest pay growth. Average annual pay growth, including bonuses, has increased in recent months as unemployment falls despite the end of furlough, reaching 5.4% in February. However, wage growth has failed to keep pace with soaring inflation driven by the rising cost of fuel and surging energy bills, exacerbated by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Inflation hit 7% in March and is expected to peak close to 10% later this year. However, the average figures mask a growing divide between different sectors of the workforce, highlighting how the cost of living emergency is likely to hit some people harder than others. Private sector staff have seen the strongest annual growth in pay, and earnings in the public sector have fallen furthest behind inflation. Xiaowei Xu, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: “Earnings inequality had been falling for some years before the pandemic hit, with low-paid workers seeing the strongest pay growth. The recent surge in pay among financial sector employees – particularly among top earners in the sector – has led to a reversal of this trend. “This appears to be the first time since the financial crisis that finance sector earnings have taken off like this and it remains to be seen whether this is a one-off spike or a new trend.” A spokesperson for UK Finance, the trade group for the financial services industry, said: “The banking and finance sector is a major source of employment around the country. It provides a range of high-skilled jobs and is one of the most important sources of tax revenue for the government.”",News/Business,"Biggest boom in City bonuses for years risks driving up inequality, says IFS",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/city-london-bonus-boom-risk-driving-up-inequality-institute-fiscal-studies
5/4/2022,"University students’ complaints about the Covid pandemic disrupting their studies led to more than 1,000 appeals to the higher education watchdog in England and Wales last year. The Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA) received a record 2,763 appeals from students unhappy at the way their complaints had been handled by their universities in 2021. More than a thousand of those were related to the effects of campus Covid measures, treble the number in the first year of the pandemic. More than one in four appeals were upheld or deemed to be justified by the watchdog. But the number of appeals understates the number of individuals involved – the OIA said that 16% of Covid disruption complaints were from groups of about 10 to 30 students, including one joint appeal from a group of more than 400 students. Students on design, creative and performing arts courses were among those most directly affected, according to the OIA, raising issues such as access to equipment and studio space or lost opportunities to exhibit work. “More widely, complaints from students across a range of subject areas often related to practical experiences that were disrupted by Covid-19 restrictions. Students complained about lack of access to laboratories, cancelled or changed projects, placements and study abroad opportunities,” the OIA said in its annual report published on Wednesday. In one case outlined by the OIA, a group of postgraduates on a healthcare research course complained about problems with laboratory work and feedback, frequent timetable changes and the ending of lab-based projects during a pandemic lockdown. The institution offered £1,000 each in compensation but the students took their case to the OIA and were eventually offered £2,500 to settle. The OIA said that some complaints included disruption arising from strikes and industrial action as well as campus closures during lockdown. Felicity Mitchell, the independent adjudicator for higher education, said that 2021 had been “dominated” by the impact of the pandemic. “Many students experienced disruption to their lives and to their studies, and providers worked hard to deliver learning and support while balancing complex considerations and risks,” Mitchell said. Overall the OIA was involved in directing compensation of £792,500 and a further £512,000 in settlement agreements, for a total of £1.3m – significantly higher than the total of £742,000 in 2020. The highest individual award for a student was £68,000, while 60 students received £5,000 or more. In one complaint, a group of students studying medicine at the overseas campus of a British university received £24,000 after a damning report by the General Medical Council. The OIA ruled that the students had been led to believe that teaching and practice would be in English but in fact the local language was used in clinical consultations. The OIA does not name the institutions involved, other than in rare cases where they refuse to comply with an OIA ruling. The OIA only hears appeals from students after they have exhausted their institution’s internal procedures and remain unhappy with the response.",News/Education,"Complaints over Covid disruption rose in 2021, student watchdog says",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/04/complaint-over-covid-disruption-rose-2021-student-watchdog-office-independent-adjudicator-england-wales
5/4/2022,"Cuts to rail funding could lead to more serious rail accidents as well as fewer, more crowded trains, unions have said. A TUC report said passenger safety will be compromised should Network Rail press ahead with reductions to its maintenance workforce to save £100m a year. About 2,500 jobs are expected to go and the TUC said it would be impossible to make such cuts without putting passengers at risk. It warned that the Treasury was also demanding cuts from train operators that would disrupt services and leave fewer trains running, leaving commuters “packed like sardines”. Network Rail said it would not compromise safety and its ideas for modernisation had “fallen on deaf ears”. The report comes as rail unions have warned of possible strike action, with the RMT having already announced a ballot of its members. About 2,500 maintenance jobs are set to be cut, leading to 670,000 fewer hours of maintenance work each year, according to analysis by the RMT. The TUC said track maintenance was essential to avoid fatal accidents such as the Hatfield crash in 2000, caused by unnoticed metal fatigue, or Potters Bar in 2002, which was due to poorly maintained points. As well as the track, Network Rail has safety responsibility in providing signalling, power supply to the railway, and the public spaces of the UK’s largest rail stations. The TUC said the government should withdraw any requirement for it to make cuts. It said Network Rail could save £115m a year by bringing all outsourced services back in-house. British railways had the best safety record in Europe for over a decade but crashes at Stonehaven in 2020 and Salisbury last year have renewed concerns. The Treasury has also ordered the Department for Transport to cut its annual budget by 10%, which has led the DfT to tell train operating companies to make major cuts to costs. The TUC’s general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “Our railways are still recovering after the pandemic. The last thing the government should be doing is slashing funding. “We need a better vision for the future of Britain’s railways than commuters packed like sardines in unsafe trains. Rail is one of the greenest ways to get around. Ministers need to make rail the most attractive option for more journeys. But you can’t do that by cutting back on safety and services.” The RMT’s general secretary, Mick Lynch, said over 40,000 rail workers could join picket lines in a strike over the planned cuts. “We are not going to be able to run a safe, clean and efficient railway network if staff are being cut to the bone,” he said, adding that the dispute was not just for his members but “the public’s right to a safe and affordable railway system”. A Network Rail spokesperson said: “Britain’s railway is the safest major network in Europe, and we’d never make changes that would compromise that hard-won achievement. “The modernisation proposals we’ve put on the table would help our workforce be more flexible, enabling us to avoid compulsory job losses [and] help our workforce be safer because they won’t work on live tracks as often. So far our ideas have fallen on deaf ears.” A DfT spokesperson said: “The industry is exploring a range of reform options but none of these should lead to the reduction of safety standards nor impact the railways’ safety for passengers. Industry will still have to fulfil their legal obligations in respect of health and safety.”",News/Business,"Cuts to rail funding threaten passenger s, unions warn",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/network-rails-proposed-cuts-put-passengers-at-risk-say-unions
5/4/2022,"By his own description, Ray Martin has been a journo for “well over half a century”. That tenure has included multiple stints hosting A Current Affair, the job that made him a household name, as well as spots on everything from ABC’s Four Corners to First Contact on SBS. Along the way, Martin has picked up five Gold Logies and an Order of Australia for his work. Last month, the media star unveiled a new documentary, Norfolk Island with Ray Martin, which is now streaming on SBS On Demand. It sees Martin journey to the beautiful island with landscape photographer Ken Duncan in search of the perfect shot. Getting behind the lens is one of Martin’s passions – in fact, he owns over half a dozen cameras and an archive of around 60,000 photographs. Here, Martin tells us why he’s come to prefer photography over writing – plus the story of two other important personal belongings. I spent my early childhood moving from town to town across country New South Wales. All up it was 13 towns before I went to high school. My father was a mechanic and mostly worked on dams, which, for some reason, was a booming business after the second world war. Packing our family’s world into a collection of suitcases meant that toys, personal possessions and especially books were mostly left behind. So there’s little from my childhood that I would sadly miss should a fire strike. Except, perhaps, for a collection of AB Paterson poems, my first Christmas present book. I still have it. It is filled with rollicking pages of verse by The Banjo, published in Sydney in 1955. I cherish this dog-eared, tattered, literary classic that somehow survived my peripatetic wanderings, secreted with my boyhood shirts and underwear. It was given to me by a young English migrant named Eric who came to stay with us for a few days, became my friend and ended up marrying my sister, Joy. Maybe the fact I never grew up surrounded by books explains why they clutter up my study, bedroom and media room today. Many of them are signed, original editions. But it’s the Banjo collection, with the faded dust jacket, that I’d almost certainly grab as the flames licked the stairs behind me. Having been a journalist for well over half a century, I owe my “fame and fortune”, cobwebbed as it is, to words I’ve written. Or spoken. Or jotted on stray bits of paper when I have been caught short of a notebook. But these days, I think I prefer taking photographs. That’s why my cameras are my most useful object. I have probably half a dozen, maybe more. No exaggeration, I must have 60,000 photos in my personal collection. If, as the cliche goes, a picture is worth a thousand words, then no snap I have ever taken is as good as my best thousand-word essay. Or column. Yet I find my camera more satisfying – even therapeutic – than writing. These days, with digital cameras or mobile phones, it’s also instant gratification. Click. Done. And with photos you set your own bar. If you’re happy with the image, well, it’s your art after all! I most regret losing my … virginity. Just kidding. But now that I have your attention, there was one item I’m sorry I lost. When I was first graded as a journalist, in my ABC youth – back in the 1960s – I was sent to Perth as a reporter. My girlfriend, who became my fiance and is now my wife of 50 years, came with me across the other side of Australia. We had no money and even borrowed from the Credit Union for our wedding. Now, as we were making arrangements for our nuptials, an ABC colleague made me an offer I couldn’t refuse. Almost.

5/4/2022,"Jürgen Klopp said reaching a third Champions League final in five seasons with Liverpool felt as good as the first one after his team recovered from a punishing first half to beat Villarreal on a pulsating night in eastern Spain. Liverpool conceded twice before the interval for a 2-2 aggregate scoreline, the stadium rocking as Villarreal advertised a stunning comeback. But inspired by the half-time introduction of Luis Díaz, Liverpool regained their poise to win 3-2 on the night and 5-2 overall. Fabinho, Díaz and Sadio Mané scored the goals to set up a final against Real Madrid or Manchester City in Paris, with Mohamed Salah hoping it will be the former. Salah wants to avenge the 2018 loss to Real in the final when he was manhandled out of the game by Sergio Ramos. “I want to play Real Madrid, I have to be honest,” Salah said. “Hopefully we’ll win it from them as well.” Klopp was overjoyed, particularly at the mental toughness that his players showed in the second half. “Outstanding, massive – it feels like the first one because it’s always so special,” the manager said. “I love it, the sound of it … the whole night. “It feels so special because it was so difficult for us. Before the game, I told the boys I wanted the headlines to be the mentality monsters were in town. I wanted it from the first moment but the second half was like that. How we came back in the second half was so special. It was a top performance.” Klopp had wanted to show his players one clip at the interval of something that had gone well in the first half to give them a boost. But the assistant manager, Pete Krawietz, told him there was nothing. Díaz helped to spark the turnaround when he came on for Diogo Jota. “But Jota was not the problem in the first half – we had 11 problems in the first half,” Klopp said. “The start was really difficult. We looked like we were impressed by them. We had no real build-up and we didn’t play in the right spaces. We played into their hands. Our minds were not right. We felt the pressure. It was a football problem in the first half. And we had to solve it with football.” Klopp has made history by becoming the first manager of an English club to reach the finals of the League Cup, FA Cup and Champions League in the same season. “It is really difficult – that is why nobody has ever done it before,” he said. “We will make sure we are ready for these finals. We will give it a go. That’s for sure.”",Sport/Football,Klopp hails ‘mentality monsters’ as Mo Salah says he wants Real Madrid in final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/03/jurgen-klopp-hails-mentality-monsters-after-comeback-against-villarreal
5/4/2022,"“You suffer and then ...”, Jürgen Klopp clicked his fingers: “... you react.” It may not have been quite that simple, nor quite so instantaneous, and it certainly wasn’t as effortless as that, but as it turned out Liverpool’s manager wasn’t far off in his prediction. Oh, they had suffered, that was for sure, and they had reacted too. Not so much a click of the fingers, perhaps, as a fist on the red button. A decision too, made in the dressing room at half-time: life is different with Luis Díaz, not least because he is different. And so when it all started up again, there he was. They had needed him. When the half-time whistle went, the Cerámica rose and started to chant: “Yes, we can!” It wasn’t the first time they had done – those words had appeared every so often from the very start – but this time they really meant it: 2-0 up on the night, the aggregate score 2-2 and the game in their grip, Villarreal were on the cusp of something special, another absurd achievement for the team that the Super League would have left behind and that had dignified the Champions League like no one else. Juventus, Bayern ... and Liverpool? Those three clubs have 14 European Cups between them. Villarreal didn’t even have a final, but it was closer now than it had ever been, a roll call of the continent’s biggest clubs defeated en route. Only, much as Liverpool were two goals down for the first time, they weren’t defeated yet and, as Unai Emery had warned, this is a side that can hurt you a thousand ways. “There is no perfect script,” Pau Torres had said, but there was and this was it, better even than they had planned, still less dared to believe. Maybe it was too good? “I look at Villarreal and think: ‘What would I do?’ Two-nil down, maybe you didn’t play your best football. Give it a go. That’s exactly what Villarreal will do. They will go for it,” Klopp had said, another prediction proven correct. It had all seemed so unlikely. Liverpool had not been beaten by more than two goals all season and even the atmosphere didn’t seem conducive to a comeback. A biblical storm had rumbled overnight and all day, rivers in the streets, supporters scurrying for shelter as much as they were singing in the streets. Rarely can the minutes before a European semi-final have felt like less of an occasion, Villarreal’s president Fernando Roig saying he worried that the weather might “take something away from this”. Even if Villarreal were to turn it round, the plan always seemed set to be a cautious one. Emery had talked about needing to be “brutal defensively”. Torres had said that one goal would put them in it and insisted: “If doesn’t matter if that comes in the first minute or the 6oth.” Instead, it came after just three. A second followed after 41, that quiet blown away, belief flooding through them, the noise making this a special night, even ultimately in defeat. Villarreal overran Liverpool, the intensity that had inhibited them before matched now. This was the perfect storm, the rain pouring around them no longer noticed in the stands, too much fun for that. Francis Coquelin, supposedly a defensive midfielder, was dashing behind the full-backs. Dani Parejo was taking control. Gerard Moreno, absent at Anfield, all clever touches. Albiol brought the ball out. Étienne Capoue delivered two wonderfully subtle moments to provide the two goals, the first scored by Boulaye Dia, the second by Coquelin. That was the good news for Villarreal. The bad news was that they had done so much so fast that, like Liverpool, they had a decision to make. Maybe it had been too fast? Level now, they had something to lose, something to hold. The second half would suggest that they might have chosen unwisely or perhaps – a simple fact so often, so easily forgotten – this was more about the team they had in front of them. The team that, led by Díaz, some footballing Sonic the Hedgehog, now tore into them. There was also, it may be as cruel to mention as it would be unrealistic not to, the goalkeeper that stood behind them. Suddenly activated, with Trent Alexander‑Arnold let loose, Mané moving into the middle, that whole red machine moving forward, faster and faster, Liverpool hit Villarreal three times in 12 minutes. Twice the ball went into the net through Gerónimo Rulli’s legs, once he honoured his name by charging from his goal to leave it unguarded. In a flash, a click of the fingers, it was gone. The reaction was ruthless and it was complete. Rulli, the man whose penalty save and penalty scored had taken Villarreal to the Europa League title last season, allowing them to reach the Champions League in the first place, crouched looking lost. Behind him, the Cerámica applauded, broken but proud. As it turned out, no, they couldn’t but for a moment they had really thought they would. They had come a long way. “How could I not love you, when you made me win in Europe for the first time?” the supporters sang, as the final moments played out and Liverpool headed to Paris, seeking their seventh.",Sport/Football,Sonic the Hedgehog rescues Liverpool and ruins Villarreal’s big night | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/03/sonic-the-hedgehog-rescues-liverpool-and-ruins-villarreals-big-night
5/4/2022,"Megan James, who lives near Nimbin, was the first of many speakers to take the microphone at a university lecture theatre in Lismore for the first community hearing of the 2022 New South Wales flood inquiry on Tuesday evening. “I’m the voice in the hills, but we’re no longer heard,” James said. She told of how farmers once phoned Lismore to warn that their rain gauges were filling and a flood was on the way; now the town relied on official forecasts that weren’t always accurate. The lack of warning from authorities of the impending floods, on 28 February and 30 March, was one of the most prevalent themes at the town hall-style meeting, at which the inquiry’s leaders, Professor Mary O’Kane, an engineer and scientist, and Mick Fuller, the former NSW police commissioner, explained they had come to listen, not provide answers. In the words of another speaker: “There was no real clear warning that it was going to be as bad as it was.” One northern rivers resident said he hadn’t come to blame State Emergency Service volunteers or the local council, but their modelling systems appeared to be failing. An array of ideas was proffered from the floor. Blocks and tackles could be used to secure houses in flood plains and wetlands of native flora planted to divert water away from residential areas, because “lots of people still want to stay in this place”. Flood mitigation could include dredging Lismore Wilsons River and restoring it to the deep channel once used by ships – today it’s barely fit for a dingy. First Nations land management practices needed to be adopted. The myriad of potholes in the region should be highlighted by white paint, because they were impossible to see at night on wet roads, and there were also calls to investigate whether the upgraded Pacific Highway had exacerbated flooding in some places. Some suggested flood-zone houses should have mandatory roof hatches, like skylights, to prevent people in attics being drowned by rising waters. There were multiple calls for the insurance system to be overhauled, community communications systems to be strengthened with satellite, and a testimony about the impact on wildlife. There were callouts for improved drainage and building flood-proof, because “clearly our infrastructure can’t handle this” and “disaster planning must be incorporated into regional planning”. There were stories of trauma – the neighbours were screaming; children saw their pets drown. One woman referenced a friend who perished while trying to be saved on Facebook, and a miraculous rescue tale – someone was pulled from a strong torrent by a string of Christmas lights. There was even laughter when Byron Bay councillor Mark Swivel lamented the national media’s focus on Byron’s inundation– “the flood came to Byron because apparently water likes linen”. The only agitation was when a woman spoke about being traumatised by the floods, which she attributed to climate change and a reliance on fossil fuels. She was met with applause and a couple of boos. Stories were told from an array of perspectives. Helen Coyle, who lives with a disability, described being stuck in Ballina, unable to return to her Lismore home because the roads were cut. She went to the Ballina hospital for help but said staff chastised her for travelling with insufficient money. She is calling for hospital staff to be kitted with the phone numbers for organisations that can support people with disabilities displaced by severe weather events. A subsequent indignity, she said, was that the floods have robbed Lismore of public disabled toilets, only portaloos. Are the disabled expected to “shit themselves”? Another Lismore resident called on flood clean-up volunteers to be trained in what is salvageable because well-intentioned volunteers had thrown away her son’s two prosthetic legs. Bruno Ros, a vet specialising in large animals, spent the first post-flood days on helicopters looking for stranded livestock and visiting isolated farming properties. “Plenty of people were on the ground, barking, screaming and pleading for help,” he said after the inquiry, “and for me as a vet the Department of Primary Industries was just inaccessible. I begged for assistance. It arrived seven days after the floods, seven days too late.” Dr Cam Hollows, a doctor on the ground in Coraki, recounted working for 40 hours and treating 60 patients in the aftermath. “We’ve repeated every single mistake of the bushfires,” he said. Lismore Labor MP Janelle Saffin agreed: “Government agencies weren’t prepared, and they need to ramp up really quickly because that’s what disasters need, but they haven’t done that.” Mark O’Toole, from Bungawalbin, said he asked members on a community Facebook page if anyone had been successful in securing a government business grant: “So far I’m up to 890 comments and nobody has got one”. There are around 100 farmers just in his town, he said, and “the money needs to start flowing now, not in six months or 12 months.” A woman fought back tears as she described families with children still camping in backyards. Another outlined simple wishes: “I’d just like a cupboard for my undies, a pantry for my food.” For more than two hours the Lismore crowd listened in near silence – a demonstration of forbearance and patience from a community that had already endured so much. The NSW flood inquiry will hold its next public hearing at the Tumbulgum Hall in the Tweed Shire on Wednesday. It is required to report to the premier by 30 September and is open to submissions from any member of the public, which can be made online, via email, post or phone.",News/Australia news,"Trauma, disbelief and plenty of ideas shared at NSW flood inquiry hearing in Lismore",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/04/trauma-disbelief-and-plenty-of-ideas-shared-at-nsw-flood-inquiry-hearing-in-lismore
5/4/2022,"Joe Biden on Tuesday told assembly-line workers at an Alabama factory that the weapons they are crafting are going into “the hands of Ukrainian heroes” on the front lines of the effort to repel Russian forces. The US president praised the employees of the Lockheed Martin plant that manufactures Javelin anti-tank missiles, saying their work was critical to the Ukrainian war effort and to the defense of democracy itself. “You’re making a gigantic difference for these poor sons-of-guns who are under such enormous pressure and firepower,” Biden told the workers from a podium flanked by the Javelin missile launchers. From a sprawling compound in Troy, Alabama, to the battlefields in Ukraine, the anti-tank missiles have helped equip the Ukrainian forces, the president said. “You’re making it possible for the Ukrainian people to defend themselves, without us having to risk getting into a third world war by sending in American soldiers fighting Russian soldiers,” Biden said, adding of the Ukrainian military: “Quite frankly, they’re making fools of the Russian military in many instances.” ""Quite frankly, they're making fools of the Russian military in many instances,"" Pres. Biden says of Ukrainian troops, during remarks at a Lockheed Martin facility that makes Javelin anti-tank missiles. pic.twitter.com/SXXythKsWr Speaking after a tour of the factory line, Biden urged Congress to approve an additional $33bn in aid for Ukraine as the besieged nation continues to battle Russian forces in the east and south. Biden said that funds spent on bolstering Ukrainian security so far was “a direct investment in defending freedom and democracy itself”. He then added: “Because if you don’t stand up to dictators, history has shown us, they keep coming. Their appetite for power continues to grow.” Nodding to concerns from some lawmakers that the steady flow of weapons to Ukraine has depleted US stockpiles, he said the assistance includes funding to “replenish our own stock of weapons to replace what we’ve sent to Ukraine”. “This fight is not going to be cheap,” he said. “But caving to aggression would even be more costly.” Support for Ukraine has largely been approved on a bipartisan basis. But the latest request, which includes $20bn for security and military assistance, represents a significant increase in the US’s investment in the effort to defeat Russia in Ukraine. Demand for the Javelin missiles remains high. According to US and Nato officials, Ukrainian forces have used the system to devastating effect against Russian tanks and artillery since the conflict began in late February. So far, the US has transferred over 5,000 Javelin missiles to Ukraine from US stocks and nearly 500 more from allies and partners, according to the White House. Lockheed jointly produces the weapons with Raytheon Technologies, which separately produces Stingers. The Alabama facility Biden toured employees approximately 600 workers and is capable of producing roughly 2,100 Javelin missiles per year. Biden also called on Congress to quickly pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act, a sprawling legislative package designed to boost US competitiveness with China by bolstering American manufacturing and strengthening supply chains. On the tour, Biden said he learned that each Javelin requires more than 200 semiconductors, the production of which have been strained by pandemic-era supply shortages. Boosting American production of semiconductors, he said, was not only a vital step toward rebuilding domestic manufacturing and lowering the cost of goods, but critical for national security.",News/US news,Biden praises Lockheed workers for making weapons for ‘Ukrainian heroes’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/03/biden-lockheed-martin-weapons-ukraine-russia
5/4/2022,"Boris Johnson’s fumbled defence of the government’s record on the cost of living has exasperated Conservative MPs and sharpened fears about the party’s performance in Thursday’s local elections. Asked about a pensioner forced to travel around on buses to stay warm and keep heating bills down, the prime minister’s first response was to boast that he introduced free travel for older people. During the interview on Tuesday, he admitted that the government had failed to do enough to alleviate the pain of soaring costs. Amid growing fears over the impact of the cost of living crisis, the Treasury is looking at whether it can cover some or all of this autumn’s energy price rise from government funds, the Guardian has learned. It is understood that Rishi Sunak’s department has been examining whether to simply absorb most of the cost, rather than offer a discount on bills or a council tax rebate. Sunak is concerned about the inflationary impact of more borrowing – but the option of absorbing some or all of the rise has been considered. A Treasury source said they “don’t recognise this as policy work being done at this point in time”. A spokesperson added: “Energy bills are capped until the autumn. We won’t know yet what the size of the rise will be given the volatility of prices we are seeing now and it’s right that we wait … [to] decide what the solution should be.” Thursday’s vote will be the first UK-wide electoral test since details emerged of lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street. Tory MPs are braced for losses in London and the south of England as a toxic combination of Partygate and the rocketing cost of living take their toll. MPs in northern England said they are more confident of holding on to local councillors. In a pre-election interview on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, the prime minister struggled to articulate what help may be available to a pensioner struggling to make ends meet. Asked about Elsie, a 77-year-old who has cut back on meals and uses buses to stay warm, he responded: “The 24-hour freedom bus pass was actually something that I introduced.” Asked what more Elsie could cut back on, he said he “didn’t want her to have to cut back on anything”. Speaking to LBC’s Tonight with Andrew Marr on Tuesday night, Reid said Elise was “disappointed” with Johnson’s response to her plight. With concerns about the cost of living a major election issue, some Tory MPs responded with irritation to Johnson’s performance. “The thing with him is, he hasn’t read the script sometimes,” said one. “There are so many positive things he could have said.” Another backbencher and former cabinet minister said: “It won’t have won us many votes. Boris doesn’t actually care about these people. He basically despises most of the human race, so that makes it quite difficult for him to sympathise.” The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jon Ashworth, said that “boasting about the London bus pass reveals just how out of touch this narcissistic prime minister is”. He added that the state pension had just suffered the biggest real-terms cut in 50 years. Both main parties are desperately trying to manage expectations before Thursday’s elections, with the Tories warning of as many as 800 losses out of more than 5,000 council seats being contested, and Labour suggesting they could make few gains. The Conservative peer and elections expert, Robert Hayward, said he projected net Tory losses of 250 to 350 seats, adding: “That will mean one or two headline Labour gains but whether that is good enough for them to be comfortable is a question mark.” Tory insiders say there are serious jitters about losing the London council of Wandsworth, though Labour said that is unlikely. A senior Tory figure said the area had become more affluent over time, which might usually favour the Tories, but instead it had seen “gentrification with remainers”. A London MP warned that among middle class, “middle-of-the-road” voters in the south of England, “it’s a Boris problem”. One senior Lib Dem strategist said the party was looking at possible gains in the new Somerset unitary authority, Oxford, Wimbledon and Woking in the south, as well as Westmoreland and Hull in the north. “We don’t expect significant takeovers of loads of different councils but we hope to see steady progress in the blue seats that are up,” they said. By contrast, “red wall” Conservatives are quietly confident of holding on to their council seats. – In key local council fights – such as Bury, Bolton, Wigan and Hartlepool – which will be seen to foreshadow whether Labour will be able to retake or hold seats at the next elections, Tories described voters as angry with Johnson over Partygate, but unwilling to make the switch to Labour. One Midlands Tory in a newly won constituency seat said: “Logically, we should actually be in a position to make gains, but Partygate and the cost of living are meaning our voters are not reliably turning out. But I’m not detecting people going back to Labour at all.” A Tory MP in north-west England said they feared that anger towards Johnson was unlikely to dissipate by the next general election, though voters were prepared to keep voting Tory locally because Labour were still seen as the establishment force. “I think the anger is now a permanent feature. We can, in a sense, get away with it this time because he’s not on the ballot paper. But this is definitely going to be held against us at a general election.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s ‘out of touch’ comments on cost of living crisis anger Tory MPs,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/03/boris-johnsons-out-of-touch-comments-on-cost-of-living-crisis-anger-tory-mps
5/4/2022,"If, when you saw the title of this documentary, The Man With a Penis on His Arm (Channel 4), your first thought was: “Wait – like the mouse with the ear on its back? But a man and a penis and an arm?” the answer is ineluctably: yes. Just like that. Malcolm, now 45, lost his penis 12 years ago and has had a replacement growing on his arm and awaiting transplant for the past six. As he put it, he was “an ordinary man doing everything a normal man does”. He had a job, “a nice partner” and was living “a man’s life, bringing in the money, putting food on the table”. The arrival of a baby, he says, disrupted things – though we later find out that the death of his father, to whom Malcolm, after time in foster care, had grown very close, killed “the happy part of me” – and he ended up on the streets and addicted to drink and drugs. An attempt to lance an abscess himself resulted in blood poisoning. His fingers and toes went black. So, too, did his penis. “Then I went to the toilet and it fell off,” he says, matter-of-factly. The interviewer’s journalistic objectivity falls momentarily away. “Your … your penis fell off?” he says. “Gone,” says Malcolm, beginning to walk out of shot. “See ya.” There is no getting away from the fact that any documentary entitled The Man With a Penis on His Arm is going to invite moments of levity. It’s not that the narrator of Malcolm’s story, Paul McGann, doesn’t do a fine job of neutrally delivering lines such as: “No one has ever spent as long living with a penis on his arm.” But if you, as a viewer, don’t feel the urge to side-eye someone and murmur: “You don’t say?” then … well, I would admire but also, in some profound way, mistrust you. Ditto at moments such as the one where, his forearm appendage swinging free, Malcolm points out that it makes it hard to reach the back hob. It almost makes you proud to be British. Still, it is the deep sadness of Malcolm’s tale – and the six years of waiting for his arm-penis to be relocated is only one part of it – that dominates. The pandemic added to the delay, but, presumably out of kindness to Malcolm, it is never made fully clear why he has had to wait so long for his operation. We are, however, given enough information to infer that his relationship with alcohol, and the difficulty of attending all the necessary appointments for surgery without support from friends who prove unreliable, are maybe something to do with it. There are two other subjects in the film: Anik, born with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome, which resulted in an underdeveloped penis; and Lee, who was born without a penis and only obtained one through surgery at the age of 42. Anik, too, has had his phalloplasty. We follow him as he undergoes yet another operation on his poor groin (his doctor doesn’t recognise his face, Anik notes), this time to reposition the internal hydraulic equipment that will enable him to have erections. There are many fascinating questions raised by all three stories, about masculinity, what it takes to be a man, what it means to be without a penis in a patriarchy and a phallocentric culture, but they are only rarely examined. Lee, for example, seems to have been born male but, in the absence of a penis, was raised as a girl (it’s unclear for how long, but for at least the first few years of his life). But, he says: “I knew I needed a penis from six or seven.” What this might tell us about biological imperatives, maleness v masculinity is not explored, nor the complicating effects of abuse by his father “before I was five”. Anik, surrounded by a supportive family and seemingly possessed of a thoroughly optimistic spirit, took an overdose at 14 as the trials of puberty seemed insurmountable. At a time when people are questioning like never before what it means to live in a male or female body, it seemed like a missed opportunity not to ask more from people with rare perspectives on the issues. But it was, really, Malcolm’s story – which, thank God, has a happyish ending. His surgeon offers him a last chance and he takes it. His penis is now back where it belongs. He shows us the results, but it’s his brighter affect that tells us what we really need to know. He feels better. “Six years with a cock on me arm,” he says in wonder. “Something to tell the grandchildren, isn’t it?”",Arts/Television & radio,The Man With a Penis on His Arm review – TV that makes you proud to be British,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/03/the-man-with-a-penis-on-his-arm-review-tv-that-makes-you-proud-to-be-british
5/4/2022,"A 77-year-old woman who has only one meal a day and travels on buses during the day to keep her household bills down was “disappointed” with Boris Johnson’s response to her plight in an interview with Good Morning Britain, the show’s presenter Susanna Reid has said. The prime minister was challenged by Reid about Elsie’s financial predicament and increasing energy bills on the ITV programme. Johnson, the former London mayor, replied: “The 24-hour freedom bus pass [allowing free bus travel for over-60s in London] was actually something that I actually introduced.” Speaking to LBC’s Tonight with Andrew Marr about her interview on Tuesday with the prime minister, Reid said: “I’ve spoken to Elsie, since the interview this morning with the prime minister, and she says how disappointed she is with what he said. “Because she says there are people who are even worse off than she is, and there was no answer for them, apart from ‘oh I was the person who was responsible for the bus pass,’ I mean, as if she’s supposed to be grateful.” Andrew Marr added: “Which is by the way, not entirely accurate itself because it was the London boroughs who brought that in.” According to Reid, Elsie’s gas and electricity bill has soared from £17 to £85 a month. She has lost weight after reducing herself to one meal a day and shops only in the late afternoons when price-reduced “yellow sticker” items come on sale. The prime minister had said to Reid that there were “plenty of things more that we are doing”, adding: “What we want to do is make sure that we have people who are in particular hardship looked after by their councils, so we are putting much more money into local councils. “We have the particular payments to help elderly people in particular with the cost of heating.” Pushed on what Elsie should cut back on, he said: “I don’t want Elsie to have to cut back on anything.” Johnson added: “The best answer is to help her abate the cost of energy as we are, but also … to make sure there’s a direct cut in her council tax as a result of what we’re doing.” During the interview, the prime minister also highlighted the winter fuel allowance and other “measures that we’ve put in place to help people”. He said the government is “making sure that we take the steps now to invest in our energy supply” to “ensure that we have the supply for the medium and the long term”.",News/Business,"Elsie ‘disappointed’ with Boris Johnson’s response, says Susanna Reid ",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/03/elsie-disappointed-with-boris-johnsons-response-says-susanna-reid

Dmitry Kiselyov, a pro-Kremlin presenter on Channel One known as “Vladimir Putin’s mouthpiece”, on Monday showed a video of an underwater missile wreaking apocalypse on Ireland and the UK. Russia could “plunge Britain into the depths of the sea” using an unmanned underwater vehicle called Poseidon, he said. “The explosion of this thermonuclear torpedo by Britain’s coastline will cause a gigantic tsunami wave up to 500 metres high. Such a barrage alone also carries extreme doses of radiation. Having passed over the British Isles, it will turn what might be left of them into a radioactive desert.” The report did not name Ireland but the simulation showed its destruction along with Britain, which has angered the Kremlin by supplying weapons to Ukraine.

5/4/2022,"Joe Biden has warned that a leaked draft supreme court ruling overturning Roe v Wade, the 1973 case which guaranteed the right to abortion, would represent a huge change in America law and could imperil a wide range of other civil rights. In a historic moment that shook the US to the core and highlighted jagged social and political divisions, the court confirmed the draft was authentic but said it did not “represent a decision by the court or the final position of any member on the issues in the case”. The US president called the provisional court opinion “radical” and said the ruling, if handed down, would represent a “fundamental shift in American jurisprudence” and could imperil rights including same-sex marriage and access to contraception. Politico published the draft by justice Samuel Alito on Monday night. The website said the draft was supported by four other right-wingers on a panel conservatives control 6-3. On Tuesday the chief justice, John Roberts, called its leak a “betrayal of the confidences of the court” which could “undermine the integrity of our operations”, and promised an investigation. The final ruling of the court will not be made until June. The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, warned that the court “isn’t just coming for abortion – they’re coming for the right to privacy Roe rests on, which includes gay marriage and civil rights.” Biden, speaking to reporters on Tuesday morning, said the draft ruling had ramifications for “all the decisions you make in your private life, who you marry, whether or not you decide to conceive a child, whether or not you can have an abortion and a range of other decisions [including] how you raise your child”. The draft ruling would allow states to declare abortion illegal. Protesters gathered outside the court on Tuesday, while demonstrations swelled throughout around the country – both in support of and against abortion rights. Thousands have joined rallies in New York, Boston, Nashville, Dallas, New Orleans and more. In San Francisco, a man was arrested after scaling the 60-floor Salesforce tower, in an apparent anti-abortion protest. Outside the supreme court, some chanted “Abortion is healthcare” and carried signs reading “Justices get out of my vagina”, “Legal abortion once and for all” and “We won’t go back”. A smaller group chanted “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Roe v Wade has got to go”. Amid tense exchanges, barriers were erected. Under cloudy skies at the bottom of the steps leading up to the majestic marble columns of the supreme court building near the US Capitol, Haley Lund, from Woodbridge, Virginia, told the Guardian: “This terrifies me. I could not sleep, so I figured I should be here. “This opens a floodgate for everyone … like the right to privacy, to due process, the right that we’re innocent until proven guilty. All of that can go away if this goes away.” In a statement, Biden outlined how Democrats might fight back. First, the president said, his administration would argue Roe was based on precedent and “‘the 14th amendment’s concept of personal liberty’… against government interference with intensely personal decisions”. “I believe that a woman’s right to choose is fundamental,” Biden said. “Roe has been the law of the land for almost 50 years, and basic fairness and the stability of our law demand that it not be overturned.” Biden said he had directed advisers to prepare responses “to the continued attack on abortion and reproductive rights, under a variety of possible outcomes”. “We will be ready when any ruling is issued,” he said. Politico said it received a copy of the draft, which also dealt with Planned Parenthood v Casey, a 1992 case, from a person familiar with proceedings in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a Mississippi case due to be decided this summer. The draft ran to 98 pages including a 31-page appendix of state abortion laws and included 118 footnotes. Alito wrote: “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.” He added: “We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. It is time to heed the constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.” As many as 26 states are expected to enact partial or total abortion bans if Roe falls. Some Republican-run states are expected to attempt to make traveling for an abortion illegal. Democratic-run states have indicated moves to protect and help women who seek an abortion. Vice-president Kamala Harris said: “The rights of all Americans are at risk. If the right to privacy is weakened, every person could face a future in which the government can potentially interfere in the personal decisions you make about your life. This is the time to fight for women and for our country with everything we have.” Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama issued a joint statement that read: “The consequences of this decision would be a blow not just to women, but to all of us who believe that in a free society, there are limits to how much the government can encroach on our personal lives.” Polling shows clear majority support for abortion access. Christian and conservative groups campaign to end it regardless. “I am angry, upset and determined,” said Democratic senator and 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren, as she rallied outside the court. She added: “The United States Congress can keep Roe vs Wade the law of the land – they just need to do it.” She was referring to the Women’s Health Protection Act, which fell down in the Senate in March, opposed by all Republicans and Democratic senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Warren added: “The Republicans have been working towards this day for decades … plotting, carefully cultivating these supreme court justices so that they could have a majority on the bench who would accomplish something that a majority of Americans do not want.” If the court overturns Roe, Biden said, “it will fall on our nation’s elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman’s right to choose. And it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November.” But legislative success would require reform to the filibuster, a Senate rule which requires 60 votes for most legislation. Moderate Democrats have blocked such moves on issues including voting rights. Biden himself has expressed opposition. This might not be the final ruling on Roe, the court continues to discuss provisional opinions until it issues its final decisions on the biggest cases before it at the end of the annual term, in June. But reproductive rights advocates are alarmed, also about wider implications, such as the right to same-sex marriage, determined in Obergefell v Hodges in 2015. Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor, said: “If the Alito opinion savaging Roe and Casey ends up being the opinion of the court,” Tribe wrote, “it will unravel many basic rights beyond abortion and will go further than returning the issue to the states: it will enable a [Republican] Congress to enact a nationwide ban on abortion and contraception.” In a sharply divided Washington, Republicans confirmed three right-leaning justices under Donald Trump, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and, just weeks before the 2020 election, Amy Coney Barrett, a hardline Catholic conservative. Biden has overseen the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black female justice, but she has not yet replaced the retiring Stephen Breyer, another liberal, and her arrival will not change the ideological imbalance. Republicans welcomed the draft ruling and condemned the leak. Josh Hawley, a hardline Missouri senator, called Alito’s draft “tightly argued, and morally powerful.” Among Republican moderates, Susan Collins of Maine – who under Trump supported the appointments of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh but voted against Barrett – pointed to a possible betrayal. “If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision,” she said, “it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office.” Among women’s rights campaigners, condemnation of the Alito draft was strong. Laphonza Butler, president of the advocacy group Emily’s List, said: “It’s past time to vote out every official who stands against the pro-choice majority.”",News/US news,US shaken to its core by supreme court draft that would overturn Roe v Wade,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/03/biden-democrats-reaction-codifying-roe-v-wade-reform-scotus
5/4/2022,"Ronnie O’Sullivan has warned his snooker rivals he may keep playing at the highest level until his mid-50s as the dust settles on another world championship victory. O’Sullivan equalled Stephen Hendry’s modern-era record of seven Crucible titles by defeating Judd Trump on Monday, further erasing any doubt to the debate that he is snooker’s greatest player. But there is no sign of the 46-year-old slowing down. He has ended the season as the world No 1, and his seventh world crown was perhaps his most impressive yet, with O’Sullivan losing only one session all tournament as he became the oldest world champion in Crucible history, setting a personal record of 15 centuries for the tournament in the process. O’Sullivan had previously said he envisaged playing for three more years at the top, but has now hinted he could carry on beyond that. “I could probably play to my mid-50s if I wanted to,” he said. “The tournaments like this will be a bit of a strain, there might not be much chance of winning them, but everything else, why not? I still enjoy being on the circuit, I’m having fun with it.” Both Trump and Hendry backed O’Sullivan to go beyond seven world titles in the aftermath of his latest victory, even if O’Sullivan himself stressed he is not concerned with accolades or being regarded as the greatest player in history. But that position is now almost certainly secure after another landmark victory in Sheffield, as his allegiance with the renowned sporting psychiatrist Steve Peters continues to bear fruit. By his own admission, O’Sullivan was ready to walk away from snooker a decade ago before uniting with Peters. Since then, he has broken nearly every record there is to break on the baize, including the most career centuries, most ranking titles and a further four world crowns in little more than 10 years. “I thought I was done at 35,” O’Sullivan admitted. “When I went to see Steve in 2011, I was ready to quit. By 33, the likes of Hendry and [Steve] Davis were on the way down, I’d accepted that was the trend. But me, Willo [Mark Williams] and [John] Higgins have kept on going and we’re still playing. I lacked that skill which he has developed in me and I wouldn’t have carried on otherwise.” “He asked me to help him be happy playing his sport,” Peters told Radio 4’s Today programme. “He’s learned to understand himself and got insights into the way he functions. He’s a very emotional man and they can get the better of him but he’s learned to recognise the trigger points, which is why he’s presenting as a different person at the snooker table. He’s very empathic but serious in what he does.” How fitting too that the latest success for snooker’s serial winner was followed every step of the way by a camera crew who will produce an upcoming Netflix documentary about O’Sullivan’s life and career. They have followed him for the last six months but in final scenes not too dissimilar to The Last Dance, which captured Chicago Bulls’ 1998 NBA play-off triumph, there will be a happy ending to this show, too. “I suppose it is a bit of a dream ending,” he said. “They’ve been following me around for six or seven months and I couldn’t have envisaged this, they’ve had a result really. There is a shelf life to every player but I don’t want to be sitting around doing nothing, I just want to prolong my career as long as I can. “If I can get another two world titles out, that would be great … but I just like playing. I enjoy work away from snooker and I’m not all-in with snooker now. I became all-in this week, I was emotionally involved. For most of the year it’s like a holiday; win or lose, it didn’t matter, but this was a different beast and I found it difficult to go into the pit again. “They say they’ve never had so much access to a sportsman before. They’ve been everywhere. There’s probably enough content to do a five-hour show.” But while the Netflix documentary about snooker’s grand master of the baize will culminate with his latest triumph, you get the sneaking suspicion that O’Sullivan’s own story is still some way from completion. For his entire career he has shrugged off the importance of breaking records, but his emotions on Monday evening suggests he knows all too well what this latest victory represents.",Sport/Sport,"‘I could play to my mid-50s,’ says Ronnie O’Sullivan after seventh world title",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/03/i-could-play-to-my-mid-50s-says-ronnie-osullivan-after-seventh-world-snooker-title
5/4/2022,"Brittney Griner dropped her impassive game face, looked at me with big sad eyes and said, “The nightmare for me was definitely feeling like I was forgotten and that I was going to end up alone.” I no longer saw a superstar. My heart ached for a young person who was an ocean away from everyone she knew. “Got here and I was all alone… I was just like ah, hell no, my life is coming to an end,” she said. We cannot allow Brittney’s fear of being forgotten, alone and far from home come true. It was 2014 and we sat in an empty conference room in Hangzhou, China. I’d flown 20 hours from Los Angeles to direct an ESPN documentary about her inaugural season overseas. Fresh out of college, she was drowning in homesickness. She didn’t speak the language and no one on her team spoke English. She didn’t like the food and survived off KFC, Pizza Hut and Skittles. And she spent her waking hours either on the hardwood or in her gray penthouse suite at the Zijingang International Hotel. Imagine all of the melancholy of Lost in Translation and none of the Bill Murray. She was there for the money. As the No 1 pick in the 2013 WNBA draft, Brittney made $49,000 in her first season for the Phoenix Mercury against the $600,000 she earned with the Zhejiang Golden Bulls. If a women’s basketball player wants to make top dollar, she must go overseas. Half of the WNBA travels to countries like China, Russia, Turkey and France for much higher salaries, which raises the question whether their careers in the US count as their real off-season. As I rewatch her interview footage today, I’m haunted by the sense that Brittney is talking about her fears not then, but now, from inside a Russian prison cell where she’s been held since 17 February. Again, she’s overseas because that’s where the money is. UMMC Ekaterinburg, where she’s played since 2015 and won back-to-back championships, pays her more than $1m, compared to roughly $228,000 from the Phoenix Mercury. Moscow alleges that she was caught with hashish oil at Sheremetyevo Airport, a crime punishable by 10 years in prison. But why should we jump to the conclusion that this Black woman is a criminal and that Russian officials aren’t lying? After years of passing through customs in Russia, do we believe she’d pack hashish oil now? The accusation of “large-scale drug transportation” by Russian authorities would be laughable if the stakes weren’t so terrifyingly high. Remember, this is the government that claims the warship Moskva burst into “fire of unknown origin” a few weeks ago instead of admitting that in all likelihood Ukrainian missiles were responsible for its sinking. I trust Russian officials to tell the truth about Brittney as much as I trust a sieve to hold water. Until Tuesday’s announcement from the US Department of State reclassifying Brittney as “wrongfully detained,” the White House, the WNBA and Brittney’s family have been largely quiet. As former WNBA star Lisa Leslie said, “What we were told was to not make a big fuss about it, so they could not use her as a pawn so to speak in this situation in war.” When I first heard this directive, I didn’t question it. I didn’t post about Brittney on social media. So often as women we are told to behave, to trust experts who know better – to comply. I’m a documentary filmmaker. I don’t know anything about international hostage negotiations. The time for silence is now over. Weeks have given way to months. A Moscow court recently announced that her detention will be extended to 19 May – a date that could be moved further into the future faster than you can say “human rights violation”. According to Tom Firestone, a former legal advisor to the US embassy in Moscow, Brittney could be held without trial for up to 18 months. Tuesday’s policy change from the White House may help shorten her sentence but it could just as easily make things worse during a time of heightened political tension between the US and Russia. Brittney may turn out to be a political hostage in a violent, homophobic country run by a sociopath who once called teaching gender fluidity “a crime against humanity”. Brittney, a two-time Olympic gold medalist who has also won NCAA, WNBA and EuroLeague championships, is the rock star of women’s basketball. She dunks at will, flaunts her gender non-conformity in couture suits, and not unlike the other Britney, likes to wear albino snakes. She’s a Black, queer woman on her second marriage and a proud LGBTQ+ activist. Few hate the values that Brittney embodies more than Vladimir Putin. We must not wait for her trial to be changed again. Or – God forbid – only stomp, scream, and make all the fuss too late, after we learn she has vanished under “mysterious circumstances.” I believe that the Biden Administration and Brittney’s team have been working hard behind closed doors to bring her home. I also believe that the “please don’t make a fuss” embargo has provided cover for the misogyny and racism of many Americans. Look for the self-righteous “she’s getting what she deserves” attitude. Some American “patriots” hate Brittney for exercising her right to stay in the locker room for the national anthem to honor Breonna Taylor and other victims of police brutality. They don’t want to hear that she said, “I don’t mean that in any disrespect to our country. My dad was in Vietnam and a law officer for 30 years. I wanted to be a cop before basketball. I do have pride for my country.” Ask yourself what the hell that’s about. Roughly 100,000 Black women and girls went missing in 2020 in the United States – yet they rarely make national headlines. According to NPR, media outlets are four times more likely to report on a missing white person versus someone who is Black or brown. (Some call this “missing white woman syndrome.”) In Brittney’s case, when does cooperative silence become complicit neglect? The answer is right now. Today’s announcement from the state department leaves no doubt. Imagine that instead of a 6ft 9in, tattooed, dreadlocked, Black woman in a Russian prison, it was a pretty blonde with a husband back home. Or what if it had been LeBron James or Steph Curry? Or Tom Brady? People would have lost their damn minds. “Don’t make a fuss” wouldn’t have been an option because no matter what the State Department might decree, it would have been a headline in every news broadcast and mentioned on ESPN twice an hour. Candlelight fan vigils would have dotted America from sea to shining sea. Perhaps such “a fuss” would have been bad for hostage negotiations – but the lack of outcry says everything about why Brittney had to go to an authoritarian, homophobic country in order to get paid in the first place. At the end of my shoot in China with Brittney, I asked one last question: “Flight or invisibility, which power would you choose?” What a dumb question. Obviously a basketball player would choose flight. “Invisibility,” she said with conviction. I furrowed my brow. But it made sense as I followed her through the bowels of the Shanghai subway station – every neck craned to behold a young legend striding past. At an outdoor market too many people pointed and stared for me to count. She graciously posed for photos with fan after fan. It must be exhausting to be a spectacle everywhere you go. I didn’t use the invisibility moment in the film, but I find myself obsessing over it these days. As if out of Edgar Allan Poe’s The Tell-Tale Heart, it feels like her wish has been granted, but in the form of a curse. I wish she had chosen flight.",Sport/Sport,Brittney Griner told me her fear of being alone and forgotten.

5/4/2022,"For Liverpool, a 10th European Cup final appearance beckons and a shot at winning the tournament for the seventh time. It was a night when their class told, specifically the control and composure that has seen them sweep all before them since the turn of the year, raising the prospect of an unprecedented quadruple. Never in doubt? Not exactly. The first half had been an ordeal for Jürgen Klopp and his players, their first-leg advantage wiped out as Villarreal ran riot. They scored through Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin and the crazy thing was that the team seventh in La Liga, with little experience of these kinds of nights, could have had more. How Liverpool reasserted themselves after the interval, the catalyst being Klopp’s introduction of Luis Díaz on the left. The January signing was virtually unplayable, tormenting anybody in his vicinity with his speed, balance and directness. It was as if a switch had been flicked and, sadly, the lights went out for Gerónimo Rulli, the erratic Villarreal goalkeeper. He was at fault to varying degrees for each of the goals with which Liverpool turned the tie around, the first being the one that he and his teammates felt the most. It had been coming. Liverpool, unrecognisable from the first half, playing higher, more cohesively, finding the spaces and their passing patterns. But surely not when Fabinho took a pass up the inside right from Mohamed Salah and unloaded from a tight angle? Rulli had the position but, in real time, the shot seemed to go through him, and did go between his legs. Liverpool were up and running. They would not look back. Díaz got the goal his performance merited, timing his run through Villarreal’s last line to rise and power a header from Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cross past Rulli, the goalkeeper feeling the ball go through his legs again. And Villarreal disintegrated thereafter, Liverpool ramming home their superiority with relish. Sadio Mané scored the third after Naby Keïta had wafted a lovely ball through for him but it was another personal disaster for Rulli. When he bolted a long way from his line, it was an all-or-nothing move. He got nothing, Mané reaching the ball first, walking it around him and then beating the covering Juan Foyth before rolling into the empty net. The hard truth for Villarreal was that Liverpool could have embellished the scoreline. Díaz had shot narrowly past the far post just before his goal and, at 3-2, the substitute Curtis Jones was denied by Rulli. Villarreal lost their heads. Pau Torres was booked for a naughty tackle on Mané while Étienne Capoue saw red late on for a second poor challenge. Klopp has endured some crushing lows against Spanish teams during his tenure, most notably the losses to Unai Emery’s Sevilla in the 2016 Europa League final and Real Madrid in the 2018 Champions League final. Not here. It was supposed to have been more straightforward – certainly on the evidence of the first leg last week when Liverpool had choked Villarreal into submission. But with this tight and atmospheric stadium bristling with belief, the home team had raced out of the blocks. A few pre-match statistics. Liverpool had trailed for a total of 69 minutes in matches since the turn of the year. They had kept 17 clean sheet in 28 games. They had not lost by two goals or more all season. Villarreal did not heed them . They had dreamed of scoring the first goal. When it came inside three minutes they were in fantasy land. “Yes, we can,” had been the cry from the home crowd before kick-off. Now it reverberated with even more feeling. The early goal was all about the touch of Capoue. He tore around the back of Andy Robertson to reach a left-wing cross from Pervis Estupiñán and the first-time cut-back was perfect, on a plate for Dia, who had burst away from Virgil van Dijk. Emery’s team snapped into challenges and they repeatedly found spaces in behind Alexander-Arnold and Robertson. Liverpool needed to shake their heads clear, to establish some sort of control but it was Villarreal who scented blood and they had the chances for 2-0 before 20 minutes were on the clock. Dani Parejo sent a low shot just wide while Gerard Moreno headed against Robertson from another Estupiñán cross when he might have done better. Liverpool could get little going before the interval and Villarreal were unlucky not to get a penalty on 37 minutes when Keïta gave away possession and Moreno played in Giovani Lo Celso. Alisson seemed to hesitate before he cleaned him out and, if the goalkeeper got a piece of the ball, it was not entirely by design. Villarreal did not cry. Instead, they scored again. Capoue crossed, after coming back inside Robertson with a Cruyff turn, and Coquelin leapt in front of Alexander-Arnold to power home. Klopp told his players that they had to move smarter in the second half, use the ball on the half-turn, mix it up. Villarreal had marked one-on-one before the break and Liverpool had been too static. Now they cut loose. Villarreal, meanwhile, appeared to have punched themselves out. They could not maintain the intensity. Alexander-Arnold watched a shot deflect off Coquelin, loop up and drop down on to the top of the crossbar while Díaz fluffed an attempted scissors kick when well-placed. Rather abruptly, the tide had turned. Klopp and Liverpool were on their way.",Sport/Football,Díaz turns tide at Villarreal to send Liverpool to Champions League final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/03/villarreal-liverpool-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report
5/4/2022,"With little hope of reprieve ahead of the warming summer months, demand for water in parts of drought-stricken California is outpacing supply. The metropolitan water district of southern California declared a water shortage emergency last week for areas that rely on the State Water Project, a sprawling system of canals, reservoirs, and pipelines that snake across roughly two-thirds the length of the state, impacting about 6 million southern Californians in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Ventura counties. Describing the drought as “one of the most alarming challenges our region has ever faced” metropolitan issued unprecedented restrictions limiting outdoor watering to one day per week and also called on all southern Californians to cut their use by up to 30%. If conservation efforts fail to fall in line with declining supplies by September, the rules could be tightened with an all-out ban on outdoor watering. “The reality is, this drought has left us without the water supply we need to meet normal demands in these areas,” said Adel Hagekhalil, metropolitan general manager in a statement. “To make sure we have enough water for their basic human health and safety needs, everyone in these communities must immediately and dramatically reduce their water use.” The move is a marked shift in a drought disaster that’s only expected to deepen with warmer and drier days ahead. Now in the third year of the drought, supplies across the region are becoming increasingly strained. Experts say more restrictions across the state are likely as the effects of climate crisis unfold faster than expected. More than a third of the American west is categorized in “Extreme drought” by the US Drought monitor, and water systems that supply the region are already stressed heading into another hot summer. The climate crisis is amplifying the effects and spiking temperatures typically push water levels lower as they drive demand higher. Meanwhile, the state’s snowpack – now at just 35% of normal for this time of year – is quickly disappearing. The metropolitan water district of southern California caters to roughly 19 million people, delivering 1.5bn gallons of water a day to 26 smaller agencies through 830 miles of pipelines. Roughly a quarter of the water travels 242 miles across the desert from the imperiled Colorado River. Another 45% is sourced from local supplies – a diverse portfolio of water recycling, groundwater, desalination, and flows from the eastern Sierra operated by the city of Los Angeles. The remaining 30% is supplied by the State Water Project, owned and operated by the California department of water resources. Sourced from the northern Sierra, the system in total serves 27 million Californians and provides water for 750,000 acres of farmland at the heart of California’s agricultural sector, which grows nearly half of the nation’s produce. Bracing for another year of devastatingly dry conditions and record-low precipitation, state officials announced last month that they were cutting water allocations from 15% to 5%. Metropolitan, as one of the largest water distributors in the US, is the system’s biggest contractor – and the reduced supply was sharply felt. Usage typically increases over the summer when the days get hot and dry. But this year, southern Californians in districts supplied by the State Water Project will have dramatically less to work with. Metropolitan has restricted outdoor watering to one-day-a-week and is limiting users to 80 gallons of water a person a day – a 36% drop from the 125 gallons the average southern Californian typically uses. As a wholesaler, Metropolitan has left specifics and enforcement up to local distributors, but included steep penalties for those who don’t comply, levying a $2,000 fine for additional water used over reduced allocations. Californians have navigated droughts before and the adaptations implemented in previous years have helped prepare them for reducing use. But outdoor remains an issue. Lush green lawns can still be spotted across the rapidly aridifying landscapes, tucked in front of businesses or lining sidewalks. The aesthetic accents offer little, but consume a lot. That’s why Heather Cooley, the director of research at the Pacific Institute, a water-focused thinktank, says the restrictions are a step in the right direction. “We don’t know how long this is going to go on so every drop of water we save now is water that can be used later,” she says, noting that a specific action – like one-day-a-week watering windows – is more helpful for users than an abstract percentage reduction. “Our research finds the greatest opportunities for saving water are outside the home and businesses. That is critical.” About half of California’s urban use goes outside. In some parts of the state, according to Cooley, up to 80% of water goes to landscaping. “Cutting back watering is one of the fastest things we can do to dramatically cut water use” Cooley says, and the time to do it is now. “This is the time when people start ramping up the outdoor use and realizing those savings from the beginning of the summer are critically important.” Agriculture still claims the lion’s share of California’s water supply but the state is still trying to reduce residential and urban use. Restrictions so far have been applied locally. Last year, Governor Gavin Newsom called for a voluntary 15% reduction but consumption actually ticked up afterward rising 2.6% in January, which was the second-driest month on record. Newsom escalated calls for conservation in March, issuing an executive order requiring urban water suppliers to amp up conservation and drought plans that indicate a shortage of up to 20%. Experts have called for stronger limits, as the climate crisis rapidly unfolds in the state and normal cycles of drought become longer and much more frequent. “The water we have now is 40% lower than the worst-case scenario in the models ever predicted,” says Dr Kurt Schwabe, a professor of Environmental Economics and Policy at the University of California Riverside. Schwabe added that he thinks the state is being too cautious about pushing agencies to do more. “We are in a new climate reality and we have to adjust more quickly than we had in the past.” Droughts are a normal part of the climate in California but rising temperatures have increased their intensity. Less snow is falling and when it does, it melts much faster, reducing runoff from what’s essentially the state’s water savings account. The predicted runoff from April through July is forecast at just 41% of average, according to the California water board. Heat bakes moisture out of the environment, speeding evaporation and stresses plants, animals, and urban and agricultural systems that require more water to manage, as supplies wane. Along with getting Californians to curb their consumption, Schwabe says updates that make the system more efficient will be essential. Statewide water use in cities and suburbs can be reduced by more than 30% with more efficient systems according to a study from the Pacific Institute. The study found opportunities to more than triple municipal water reuse and significant potential for stormwater recapture. Metropolitan is already looking into bolstering its supply, exploring improvements to infrastructure and investing in new sources, including recycled water. Desalination, a more controversial and energy intensive approach with the potential for negative environmental impacts, has also been considered. “You would have to build a desalination plant every four miles along the coast to replace the water we import,” according to a Metropolitan informational page about the issue on its website. “That isn’t an environmentally or economically feasible solution. We must maintain the reliability of our imported supplies.” But for now, conservation will be key. “Californians have done a wonderful job in terms of reducing their gallons per capita per day,” Schwabe says, adding that it’s largely done indoors. There are still opportunities to reduce outdoor use and options left to navigate drought conditions, even as they become more intense. “There is reason to be optimistic,” he says, cautioning agencies against relying too heavily on raised rates as disincentives that make water less accessible to lower-income households. “There are these shifts with the timing of water, how often you water, and then there is the landscape you have to water. That’s the area where there are still significant opportunities.”",News/US news,California’s new drought rules: will they be enough to halt the ‘alarming challenges’ ahead?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/03/californias-new-drought-rules-will-they-be-enough-to-halt-the-alarming-challenges-ahead

The US supreme court is poised to overturn Roe v Wade, the most fundamental rulings in US law that enshrined the right to abortion nationwide, according to a leaked draft opinion. Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed the authenticity of the document and announced an investigation into the leak. Publication of the draft opinion sparked demonstrations outside America’s highest court, condemnation from Joe Biden and fears the judiciary has suffered profound damage to its reputation for independence. Biden has said he is “not prepared” to support ending a Senate filibuster to pass abortion rights law. More than half of US states will outlaw abortion immediately or as soon as practicable, if the law is overturned. An expert radiologist says Australian federal police continued to use wrist X-rays to prosecute children as adult people smugglers after he had given unequivocal evidence of the technique’s unreliability, something he now says was “just wrong” and akin to “child abuse”. Amid allegations of war crimes, of murder and of domestic violence, the death of a dog has dominated days of evidence in the Ben Roberts-Smith defamation trial. The identity of an Afghan special forces member who shot the stray dog during an SAS mission in July 2012 could prove critical in an allegation of murder made against Roberts-Smith in the newspapers’ defence.

The cost of living is rightly centre stage in the federal election campaign, and lately we’ve been hearing more about (some of) the challenges of housing affordability from our politicians. “When will our politicians launch a fearless public conversation about housing affordability for people who don’t have a skerrick of a chance of stepping on any rung of any mortgage ladder?” writes Jennifer Beveridge. Alex Garland’s next film, Men, is due for release in June. If you’re intrigued by the mysterious trailer, then Garland’s directorial debut, Ex Machina, is well worth investigating. “With this tense, psychological thriller, Garland asks the biggest question of all: what does it mean to be alive? Ex Machina is essentially 108 minutes of three people sitting around talking to each other, but this existential grappling is so compelling that it is impossible not to be drawn into both the story and the bigger questions that motivate it,” writes Adam Fleet.

5/4/2022,"The World Trade Organization’s (WTO) most powerful members said on Tuesday that they had agreed on a proposed waiver on intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines in the hopes of speeding up rollouts worldwide. The proposal from the so-called Quad (the European Union, India, South Africa and the United States) will still have to go to the full council, but China has indicated it is prepared to vote in favour. If passed, it could allow developing world countries to manufacture Covid vaccines without paying Pfizer, Moderna and other pharmaceutical companies licenses. WTO director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has made vaccine equity her top priority since taking office in 2021. She has been working for months to broker a compromise after an 18-month-long impasse. “What the discussions were aiming at was coming up with something workable,” Okonjo-Iweala told Reuters, saying she hoped the WTO’s 164 members would finalise and approve the proposal by June. “This will advance the discussion and dialogue. For the next pandemic or a flare-up of this one, this is hugely important,” she said. Vaccination rates in wealthy countries are now between 70% and 90%, and many are discussing a fourth round of injections. But in poorer countries vaccination rates remain low, due to cost and lack of supply. More than 30 countries have vaccinated less than 10% of their population, according to the Multilateral Leaders Taskforce on Covid-19. The pharmaceutical industry has lobbied against the move and other critics have charged that waiving patents will still not solve vaccine inequity in the short-term because manufacturing and supply issues will remain. The document showed that there were still unresolved areas in the draft deal, including on the duration of the waiver’s application which could be either three or five years. Okonjo-Iweala said recent negotiations had focused on getting broader support for the deal, including from China. She said Beijing had indicated it was “favourably disposed” to being considered as a developed country in this deal and thus subject to stricter rules. The Chinese mission to the WTO in Geneva did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters contributed to this article.

5/4/2022,"Within moments of the final whistle, red smoke was billowing from the midfield area that had been so fiercely contested during the previous 98 minutes. Bournemouth’s pitch had been filled by jubilant fans from every conceivable demographic: right up to the woman who, supported by a crutch, waved a Colombia flag in the air to honour Jefferson Lerma. Inside the dressing room her hero was otherwise engaged, shaking a champagne bottle vigorously enough to ensure that the club chairman, Jeff Mostyn, had no chance of escaping a soaking. Mostyn will be thrilled to pay the dry-cleaning bill. This promotion does not brim with the romance of their first ascent to the top flight, infused though that was by the ample resources of their Russia-born owner Maxim Demin, but it comes with its own measure of intense satisfaction. In their second season after relegation Bournemouth needed to show they had the resilience, as a club, to bounce back and avoid a longer-term slide into the second tier’s morass of speculators and water-treaders. They have done so with this win and it is also a triumph for Scott Parker just 51 weeks after a relegation with Fulham that left him, in his own words, “hurt and gutted”. This time, after a slightly fractious couple of attempts to clear the surface ended successfully, Parker was able to address his public amid a warm glow. “This group are a special group,” he told the crowd. “I’m immensely proud of what they’ve done. They deserve their moment and they deserve to be in the Premier League.” Later on, to a far smaller audience, he struck a reflective note. “I’m emotional, of course I am,” he said, before promising to break the habit of a career and allow himself to get lost in the moment over a couple of beers. His three seasons in management have brought two ascents and last season’s punch to the stomach. “If you’d told me, growing up in inner London, that I’d have these opportunities I’d have bitten your hand off.” His primary focus, though, was on the collective who saw Bournemouth home. They initially made hard work of it against a Nottingham Forest side that had momentum, a buoyant away support, pace to burn on the counterattack and a chance to take control of the race for second place with three points. Nottingham Forest defender Steve Cook revealed paramedics saved his father's life before his side's 1-0 defeat at Bournemouth. Former Bournemouth skipper Cook, who joined Forest for an undisclosed fee in January, said his father had had a heart attack at the Vitality Stadium in a post on Twitter congratulating his former club for sealing promotion. Cook, 31, said: ""First of all a big congratulations to Bournemouth on promotion but tonight I need to thank the paramedics at the game. Unfortunately my dad suffered a cardiac arrest just before the game and they managed to bring him back to life. I'll forever be grateful for their actions."" Cook started the game for Forest, who needed to win to keep alive their own chances of automatic promotion going into the final game on Saturday. The centre-half was substituted in the 84th minute and replaced by Forest forward Joe Lolley soon after Kieffer Moore had scored Bournemouth's decisive goal, which clinched them a second-placed finish. Cook, who played in over 370 games in all competitions for Bournemouth during his 10-year spell at the south-coast club, was making his 17th appearance for Forest on his first return. PA Media Steve Cooper’s players may well return their club to the top, for the first time since 1999, through the playoffs and it would be one of the season’s most thrilling stories. Had Sam Surridge not struck the bar after nine minutes, and had they been awarded a penalty before half-time when the striker was incorrectly ruled offside as Mark Travers clipped him, history might have been reshaped. “The referee [Stuart Attwell] and the linesman have just pulled me in to apologise, they’ve owned up to a huge error,” said an exasperated Cooper. Ultimately both sides got what, on the night and across the full campaign, they deserved. Bournemouth emerged from the interval an entirely different proposition and dominated the second half, at least until an eight-minute period of stoppage time that saw the Forest keeper Brice Samba advance for a corner and flick narrowly over. Their winner was wonderfully worked and conjured its own happy subplot. Kieffer Moore fractured his foot three minutes into his Bournemouth career after a mid-season move from Cardiff and it was miraculous enough that, despite suffering a setback, he was able to leave the bench and score twice in a comeback draw against Swansea last week. This time Parker deployed him for the final half-hour and, when Jordan Zemura won a free‑kick near the 18-yard line, Moore stationed himself on the left of the box. Nobody paid much attention: the situation was ripe for Philip Billing to have a crack. Billing ran up and, fooling everyone, laid the ball to Moore. The finish was first-time, unerring and placed perfectly across Samba; it was a touch of guile from a 6ft 5in striker of many gifts, and Bournemouth were back in the big time. “It was off the cuff: good players showing their initiative and being incredible,” Parker said of the routine. “It’s an amazing story. [Moore]deserves this moment.” Even so it had little on the pre-match announcement that David Brooks, Bournemouth’s gifted schemer, has been given the all‑clear from the stage two Hodgkin lymphoma with which he was diagnosed in October. “The news we got today was incredible,” Parker said. “The club, the team, were rocked when we heard the [diagnosis] and it put things in perspective.” Brooks will grace the Premier League, and Parker has another chance to shape a team that can do the same.",Sport/Football,Bournemouth’s Moore seals promotion to Premier League and frustrates Forest,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/03/bournemouth-nottingham-forest-championship-match-report
5/4/2022,"My aunt Minny McCormack, who has died aged 102, was among the first German women allowed to marry a British soldier after the second world war and was one of the last living war brides. That soldier, my uncle, Jim McCormack, fell in love with her soon after knocking on her door and asking for a cup of tea in war-ravaged Aachen in September 1945. His unit had taken over the adjacent manor house. A year later, she left Germany for Jim’s home in Liverpool. They were married in 1946 and she stayed in the UK for the next 75 years. Born Berta Wilhemine Roessler, shortened to Minny, in Aachen, to Berta (nee von Knappen) and Emil Roessler, a chauffeur and estate administrator, she went to secondary school in the city, leaving at 16 to start an apprenticeship at a local pharmaceutical company. Aged 19 when war broke out in 1939, Minny got through the first years with no more hardship than other German civilians. But things got worse for her after D-day. In October 1944, American troops took Aachen, the first German city to fall to the allies. She fled east on a bicycle, on foot and on the back of trucks, carrying only essential belongings in suitcases. For four months, she spent nights in woods, barns and abandoned buildings, once sheltering under a railway carriage during an allied air raid. Only in May 1945, once Germany had surrendered, did she slowly make her way back to her home in bomb-shattered Aachen, where a period of desperate hand-to-mouth existence began in a country on its knees. Enter Jim, whose command of the German language made it easy for the couple to quickly get to know each other. Romance blossomed while Minny worked for Jim’s Intelligence Corps section in return for food, cooking for them while they went about the postwar hunt for Nazis fleeing over the border into the Netherlands. After marriage, Jim and Minny settled in Carshalton Beeches, Surrey, bringing up their only child, Ingrid, in a bilingual and bicultural manner – a brave move in postwar Britain. Jim died of a brain tumour in 1972, leaving Minny a widow for 50 years. But she stayed in the UK, remaining close to the wider McCormack family, teaching German at Sutton College of Learning for Adults and involving herself in her local church. In her mid-90s she moved to the Cotswolds to be near to Ingrid, who wrote up her parents’ story in The Bride’s Trunk: A Story of War and Reconciliation. Minny is survived by Ingrid and her grandchildren, Matthew and Gabriela.",News/World news,Minny McCormack obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/minny-mccormack-obituary
5/4/2022,"Mwai Kibaki, who has died aged 90, stood at the crossroads of fundamental political change in Kenya, often without knowing the scale of the forces he was helping to unleash. He served as the country’s third president, from 2002 to 2013; his most meaningful reform was the introduction of free primary education. But corruption dogged his administration and constitutional issues, particularly in terms of how much power should be vested in the presidency, often dominated. In 2007 Kibaki won elections that no major external observer group felt able to validate as free and fair, and as a result huge violence broke out across Kenya, much of it in the shape of ethnic conflict. It took the intervention of the former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan to force a compromise in which Kibaki retained the presidency while his political rival, Raila Odinga, became prime minister. A subsequent rewriting of the Kenyan constitution reduced the powers of the presidency considerably, and a chastened Kibaki turned his technocratic skills to reforming and reviving the national economy. He achieved economic growth against considerable odds and was able to revitalise parts of the country that had previously been overlooked by governments seeking only electoral support. Although corruption remained untamed and the spectre of ethnic favouritism was never fully diminished, by the time he left office Kibaki could claim to have transformed and modernised the Kenyan economy along more inclusive lines, and – even if it was forced on him – to have presided over an equally important overhaul of the country’s constitution. Kibaki was born in the village of Gatuyaini to Kibaki Gĩthĩnji and Teresia Wanjikũ, who were peasant farmers. Showing early academic promise, he went to Mang’u high school before moving on to Makerere University in Uganda, gaining first class honours in economics and then going on to the London School of Economics, where his postgraduate studies focused on public finance. Returning to Africa, Kibaki taught at Makerere until 1961, when he joined the Kenya African National Union party (Kanu) as an executive officer and began his career in politics as Kenya became independent in 1963. Kanu dominated in the early days of the country’s single-party state, and Kibaki quickly rose through its ranks. By 1969 he was minister of finance under the first president, Jomo Kenyatta, and under Kenya’s successor, Daniel arap Moi, he also held ministerial portfolios, becoming vice-president from 1978 to 1988. However, after Kenya reverted to a multiparty system in 1991 – following much pressure from the populace – Kibaki soon abandoned Kanu and declared himself founder of the Democratic party, one of a host of new opposition parties. In 1992 and 1997 he lost to Moi in the presidential elections, mainly due to division within opposition ranks, but he carried on as leader of the official opposition from 1998 to 2002, when finally – in an alliance of parties – he succeeded in winning the presidency. Unlike his predecessors Kibaki never sought to embed himself in a personality cult, and his image was of a quiet, gentlemanly technocrat. However, during his first term it was generally felt that corruption increased, and his undemonstrative demeanour meant he was unable to achieve great personal popularity with the electorate, despite his early introduction of free primary education across the country. When Kibaki lost a referendum that would have introduced more sweeping presidential powers, it became clear that the electorate was already tiring of an administration in which Kibaki’s supporters and Kikuyu kinsmen felt it was their “turn to eat”, as the popular phrase went. At the same time, support grew for a more diversified constitutional system that could usher in greater equity in development and economic progress. All of this meant that Kibaki faced an uphill battle during the 2007 presidential elections. Heading a new coalition of parties, he faced a formidable opposition led by Odinga and all the opinion polls, including one commissioned by the US government, had his rival ahead. Early counting also had Odinga winning the election, but somehow Kibaki turned the tables and cries of fraudulent intervention in the count began to gather volume, with external observers doubting the result’s credibility. Before the election had been held, Kibaki and Odinga had mobilised nationwide gangs of party supporters, ready to swing violently into action in the event the result went against them. After the election Kenya was plunged into political conflict, with more than 1,000 deaths and hundreds of thousands displaced from their homes. It took the intervention of Annan, at the behest of the African Union, to force the non-constitutional compromise in which Kibaki kept the presidency but Odinga was made prime minister. Against Annan’s background threat of indictments before the international criminal court, a resultant rewriting of the Kenyan constitution involving a team of jurists drawn from several African jurisdictions reduced the powers of the presidency greatly. Working under a new constitutional framework and without the possibility of running for the presidency again, Kibaki turned his attentions to the economy, and despite being hampered by the global financial crisis of 2008 was able to make progress. Some of the work had begun in his first term, but he was able to make a much greater and wider-reaching difference in his second stint with the help of his coalition partners. His successor, Uhuru Kenyatta, praised Kibaki as a transformer. Kibaki married Lucy Muthoni in 1961; she died in 2016. He is survived by their four children, Judy, Jimmy, David and Tony. In 2005 the Kenyan media reported that Kibaki had a second wife, Mary Wambui. She was a political activist in his party whom he had allegedly married under customary law in the 1970s. Wambui frequently appeared as if she were the first lady, but Kibaki always denied that she was his spouse.

5/4/2022,"Men and boys are among the alleged victims of rape by Russian soldiers in Ukraine, where dozens of cases of sexual violence by the invading forces are already under investigation, UN and Ukrainian officials said on Tuesday. “I have received reports, not yet verified … about sexual violence cases against men and boys in Ukraine,” said Pramila Patten, UN special representative on sexual violence in war, at a press conference in Kyiv. Patten added that it can be particularly challenging for male rape survivors to report the crime. “It’s hard for women and girls to report [rape] because of stigma amongst other reasons, but it’s often even harder for men and boys to report … we have to create that safe space for all victims to report cases of sexual violence.” She warned that dozens of cases of sexual violence that are under investigation so far “only represent the tip of the iceberg”, as she urged survivors to come forward, and the international community to find perpetrators and hold them responsible. “Today’s documentation will be tomorrow’s prosecution,” she said. Ukraine’s prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova said on Tuesday that her office had collected reports of sexual violence by Russian troops against men and women of all ages, from children to elderly people. Speaking at a news conference in the shattered Kyiv suburb of Irpin, one of a cluster of small towns whose names have become synonymous with Russian war crimes, Venediktova said Moscow had used rape as a deliberate strategy. “This is, of course, to scare civil society … to do everything to [force Ukraine to] capitulate.” There have been few public accounts of sexual violence in Ukraine. Some victims have left the country, and others who have stayed are frightened of speaking about their experience, Venediktova said. However, teams of prosecutors and investigators have been gathering evidence of widespread sexual violence since Russian forces retreated just over a month ago. Gang-rapes, assaults at gunpoint, and rapes committed in front of children are among the grim testimonies they have collected from victims and their families. The country’s human rights commissioner Lyudmila Denisova, has officially documented the cases of 25 women who were kept in a basement and systematically raped in Bucha, which neighbours Irpin. Forensic doctors carrying out postmortem examinations on women buried in mass graves say they have also found evidence some were raped before being killed by Russian forces. UN envoy Patten said she was visiting Kyiv because of the overwhelming indications of widespread, systematic sexual violence in the conflict, and the risk to Ukrainian women from trafficking if they try to flee the conflict. “All the warning signals are flashing red in Ukraine, with allegations of brutal sexual violence emerging,” she said, at a press conference with Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Olga Stefanishina. “I could not stay back in my office in New York, in the face of such harrowing reports of sexual violence. I’m here because we must spare no effort to ensure zero tolerance and consistent consequences for these crimes,” Patten said. While the fighting has ended around Kyiv for now, Russian soldiers still hold swathes of territory in the south and east of the country. Amid growing concern about rape there too, activists are trying to get emergency contraception into Ukrainian hospitals as quickly as possible. Patten warned that for too long, the world had allowed sexual violence to be deployed as a cheap, silent and effective weapon against whole communities. “Cheap, because it is cost free. Very effective, because it does not only affect the victim, it affects whole families, the communities,” she said. “It is biological warfare. It is psychological warfare.” She said the UN would work with Ukrainian authorities to provide support for survivors, but is also investigating crimes to prepare cases for criminal trial. Ukrainian investigators have already identified Russian soldiers they allege are responsible for war crimes including sexual violence, and an arrest warrant has been issued for one man accused of rape. There has been international support for investigations, with French and Dutch forensic experts already on the ground. Britain has also promised to send investigators to help gather evidence of war crimes, including sexual violence. But many question whether soldiers who have already retreated will face prosecution, as they are under the protection of the government in Moscow which ordered the invasion and denies committing war crimes.",News/World news,Men and boys among alleged rape victims of Russian soldiers in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/men-and-boys-among-alleged-victims-by-russian-soldiers-in-ukraine
5/4/2022,"Boris Johnson has said he has not been contacted by police about a leaving party held for his former spin doctor Lee Cain in November 2020. The prime minister said he had not yet received a questionnaire in relation to his alleged attendance at the party for Cain, his former director of communications, even though other people present are reported to have got them. Johnson is said to have given a speech and poured drinks at the event on 13 November, despite it being at the time of a stay-at-home lockdown. Asked by Times Radio whether he had received a Metropolitan police questionnaire about the party, Johnson said: “I am not commenting on this stuff generally, but the answer to that is no, not so far, or certainly not to my knowledge. “All of this will become clear with the end of the investigation.” He added: “I have been very clear with people. I don’t want to give a running commentary on the thing, so let’s wait until it is all concluded and then I will have plenty more to say.” The prime minister also said he wanted to “focus on the stuff” for which he was elected. Earlier he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that he had “no idea” whether he would be given any more fines for parties in Downing Street under Operation Hillman. He has already been fined – along with his wife, Carrie Johnson, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak – over a gathering held in the Cabinet Office for his birthday. However, he does not appear to have been fined over a “bring your own booze” party in the Downing Street garden in May 2020. In January, Johnson admitted attending the event – held during the first national lockdown, when indoor and outdoor social mixing were banned – for about 25 minutes but claimed he “believed implicitly that this was a work event”. Johnson’s principal private secretary at the time, Martin Reynolds, is said to have invited up to 100 people to the “socially distanced” evening drinks.

5/4/2022,"A Greek court’s decision to exonerate four police officers involved in the brutal death of an LGBTQ+ activist in Athens has alarmed human rights groups, which deplored the verdict as profoundly unjust. Two men were found guilty on Tuesday of participating in the killing of Zak Kostopoulos, but the four police officers, also accused of causing fatal bodily harm, were allowed to walk free. Reacting to the verdict, Amnesty International’s Greek branch director, Glykeria Arapi, said: “Today’s decision is yet another example in Greece where victims of unnecessary use of force and their families are left without justice.” Nearly four years after Kostopoulos was beaten to death in broad daylight, the activist had become a symbol of the fight for freedom and equality, the group said. “Zak Kostopoulos will not be forgotten … we take the ruthlessness of his senseless death and the injustice of today’s decision personally. In response we will redouble our efforts to make Zak’s vision – a world free from prejudice, stigma and racism – a reality.” Anny Paparousou, a lawyer representing Kostopoulos’s family, said the ruling reflected a longstanding culture of police impunity in Greece. From the outset the case had not only exposed endemic homophobia in Greek society, but a culture of widespread abuse in the nation’s police force. “It follows in the tradition of police violence never being punished even by our courts,” she said. “While we welcome the guilty judgments we are disappointed and opposed to the four officers being set free when we have documented evidence of their participation in the crime.” Kostopoulos, a drag artist, columnist and prominent queer campaigner, was killed after appearing to seek refuge from unknown assailants in a jewellery shop in central Athens in September 2021. His discovery inside the store caused pandemonium: the shop’s owner and an estate agent with offices on the same street brutally set upon him. Footage from security cameras and phones showed police violently attempting to arrest Kostopoulos as he lay dying on the ground; witnesses described the scene as being tantamount to a lynching. The 33-year-old died from his injuries before emergency workers could take him to hospital. All six defendants were accused of inflicting fatal bodily harm. The jewellery shop owner, Spyros Dimopoulos, and estate agent, Thanassis Hortarias, were given 10-year custodial terms after the court voted, five to two, to uphold the charge – although on grounds of age, Dimopoulos, 77, will be allowed to serve the sentence at home. Although three of the tribunal’s members, including its presiding judge, recommended that the police officers be convicted of dangerous bodily harm, the men were acquitted by a majority of four to three. Kostopoulos’s family had pressed for murder charges to be brought. Amnesty had described the activist’s death as “murder”. Paparousou did not rule out appealing against the decision before Greece’s supreme court. Late on Tuesday, thousands of supporters took to the streets demanding justice for Kostopoulos.",News/World news,Greek court acquits four police officers over death of LGBT activist,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/greek-court-acquits-four-police-officers-over-death-of-lgbtq-activist
5/4/2022,"It is not the done thing for candidates for the Metropolitan police commissionership to publicly discuss their candidacy, and those who apply will face an anxious wait to see if they have made the shortlist. Of the possible candidates remaining, Mark Rowley is a proven operator under intense pressure on a national stage. He was head of counter-terrorism in 2017 when Britain was hit by a wave of terror attacks in London and Manchester. Rowley was close to the commissioner before Cressida Dick, Bernard Hogan-Howe, and seen as intelligent and a moderniser. He applied in 2017 and lost out to Dick. One strike against him then was tension with Theresa May, then the home secretary. But in truth, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, was in the driving seat to select the Met commissioner, and saw a chance to make history by appointing Dick as the first-ever female holder of the top policing post. Rowley started as a beat officer in the West Midlands, where he was savagely attacked by a gang of football hooligans. He rose to become the chief of Surrey police, joining the Met as an assistant commissioner. He left policing in 2018. In his time away he co-wrote a report on extremism and also wrote critically of the Met’s use of stop and search. As well as being chief constable of the Devon and Constable force, Sawyer leads for police chiefs on performance. That is where he has face time with ministers and officials, and has impressed some. He has had to negotiate a government wanting some measures on performance amid concerns from chiefs it is a return to priority-skewing targets. Sawyer will stand down as chief of the south-western force in August. His toughest time was the shooting in Plymouth when five people died at the hands of gunman Jake Davison. Police face a hard time explaining their decision to return a gun licence to Davison just before the shooting, having taken it away for an alleged clash in the street. Sawyer previously served in the Met tackling violence, and also as a commander in counter-terrorism. He recently applied to be the head of the policing inspectorate, losing out to Andy Cooke. “Ticks the boxes,” said one fellow chief, who added: “He is popular with some in the Home Office.” City Hall sources would also be interested in Andy Marsh’s ideas for the Met. Marsh has recently been appointed as chief executive officer at the College of Policing, which sets the standards for law enforcement. The timing of this appointment may be one factor deterring him from applying for the Met commissionership. He describes himself as “a transformational chief constable” having led two forces, first Hampshire and then Avon and Somerset. There he suffered the wrath of government when a statue of a slave owner was pulled down and dumped in a canal during Black Lives Matter protests. Some in government thought police should have done more to intervene. Marsh can talk engagingly about how greater use of data and analytics can boost crime fighting, music to the ears of the policing minister, Kit Malthouse. An assistant commissioner in the Met, Ephgrave fronted the Met’s press conference after Wayne Couzens was sentenced to a whole-life term for the murder of Sarah Everard. Two sources say he may be considering a bid. Few think a Met insider is what government or City Hall want, but Ephgrave can be personable and insightful. He is a former chief of Surrey police. Currently a Met assistant commissioner and head of counter-terrorism, Jukes was a former chief of South Wales police and pioneer of police use of live facial recognition technology, an initiative steeped in controversy. May sit this round out and be a strong contender for deputy commissioner and likely candidate next time. Stephen House, acting commissioner, was Dick’s deputy and the first chief of Police Scotland when all its forces joined to create a single one. Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs council, is a former Met assistant commissioner who joined policing from the military. Dave Thompson, outgoing chief of West Midlands, was well regarded but never really fancied the Met’s top job.

5/4/2022,"Civil servants described the government’s Covid testing programme as “unlegit” and “no way to do business” in emails revealed in a high court challenge to the awarding of up to £85m in contracts for antibody tests. The campaigning organisation Good Law Project (GLP) is challenging the health and social care secretary, claiming the contracts with Abingdon Health, a medium-sized UK firm, were unlawful because they were not advertised nor open to competition, and the correct procurement process was bypassed. The antibody tests developed by Abingdon later failed to pass regulatory tests and the vast majority expired without being used. At the beginning of the hearing in central London, the GLP released details of emails obtained as a result of its legal challenge, including one in which David Williams, then the second permanent secretary at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), expressed concern at “how unlegit the entire testing strand is”. In another email, concerned specifically with Abingdon, Steve Oldfield, the chief commercial officer at the DHSC, asked Williams to “have a quiet word with [Lord] Bethell and explain to him that we could make this all a lot more legit if we just took two days to do a public call-to-arms to ‘flush out’ any other companies who might be able to play a role in this space, and remove the criticism that we haven’t given everyone a fair chance”. Bethell, then a health minister, is said by the GLP to have “made a number of interventions to assist [Abingdon]”, including championing the company – unlawfully, according to the GLP – on the basis of it being British. Bethell’s WhatsApp messages relating to government business have been unavailable for disclosure in the case because they were deleted when he replaced his mobile phone. The GLP said there were concerns highlighted over the way contracts were being awarded in relation to Abingdon but also more generally, with one email by a civil servant stating: “[This is] no way to do business but we are in exceptional times.” Additionally, the documents show an unnamed external consultant for the health and social care secretary saying of the arrangements with Abingdon: “Beyond the individual risks by themselves is there a point of mentioning that in conjunction with each other it becomes a monster of a story: first, we selected the RTC [rapid test consortium, which included Abingdon] without competition, then we might have a biased validation leading to a favoured product, we help them financially by funding upfront purchases without sufficient due diligence (ie, no contract in place) and with that commit to buying the test kits without anchoring any pricing principles. That’s big.” After Public Health England found the tests were not accurate enough for mass antibody testing they were still accepted by the DHSC, with the government saying they were suitable for use in surveillance studies, although emails also showed concerns were raised about Abingdon going bust and “extensive reputational/political damage”. Concern was subsequently expressed that it “will look like we’ve bought a load of worthless devices”. A DHSC spokesperson said: “Our engagement with Abingdon Health was led by officials – not ministers or MPs.” The case is expected to last three days.",News/World news,"Civil servants called UK Covid testing scheme ‘unlegit’, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/civil-servants-called-uk-covid-testing-scheme-unlegit-court-hears-abingdon-health
5/4/2022,"Parents and students at one of England’s top academy schools, where the children of Michael Gove and former Commons Speaker John Bercow are pupils, are locked in a bitter dispute with ministers about plans for the school to be taken over by one of the country’s largest academy chains. About 200 students at Holland Park school, west London, once known as the “socialist Eton”, are reported by a local council officer to have been involved in a “riot” inside the building two weeks ago in protest at plans for it to join the United Learning Trust, an academy chain that includes more than 80 private and state schools. A group of parents has called on the Department for Education to jettison the proposal. Lawyers for the parents have sent a pre-action judicial review letter to governors, alleging a flawed consultation and improperly constituted governing body, and the campaign group has asked for a meeting with ministers. Melanie Juno Wolfe, convener of the Holland Park School Parent Collective, said: “Pupils are distressed by what is happening. They do not want ULT or a multi-academy trust (Mat). With no voice they have had to resort to protesting. There is no PTA or body other than this large collective.” The group has accused the school’s interim governing body of being “detached” and failing to fill parent governor vacancies before the decision was taken to make ULT the preferred academy provider. The interim body was put in place by the DfE after allegations of a toxic environment, including bullying and humiliation of staff and pupils, misleading Ofsted and poor safeguarding practices under the recently departed headteacher, Colin Hall. At the time of the allegations, Hall said: “We don’t recognise the characterisation of the school or our leadership in the allegations raised.” The Education and Skills Funding Agency issued Holland Park school with a notice to improve last year, relating to the school’s financial oversight. The new governors also set up an independent investigation, which is ongoing, into practices under Hall’s leadership. Now, says Wolfe, a large number of parents are angry about the prospect of the school “becoming part of a large academy trust which is not part of our local community”. “There is a complete lack of transparency or parental and teacher involvement. We have been cut out of any discussions. ULT is presented as the only option.” The government announced in its schools white paper, published in March, that it wants all schools to become part of multi-academy trusts by 2030. In a move that could set a precedent for how the mass academisation policy develops, parents are pushing for Holland Park to continue as a stand-alone academy or to join forces with the local authority and nearby Kensington Aldridge academy, which had close links with Grenfell Tower and lost four pupils in the 2017 fire. Parents allege that a bid put in by KAA to form a trust with Holland Park was not given sufficient consideration by the governors. Wolfe says the parents feel as if ministers see Holland Park as “ripe for the picking”. “It is our community school. We would like to retain our identity and character and if we must join a multi-academy trust it should be rooted in the local community.” A petition opposing the Mat takeover has attracted hundreds of signatures and Michael Gove’s ex-wife, the journalist Sarah Vine, weighed into the debate when the ULT decision was announced, tweeting: “Why is a company based in Peterborough being put in charge of a school in west London. How can they possibly have any idea what’s best for our students?” The local Tory council, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, has spoken out about the chaotic situation at the school following Hall’s departure. The lead member for children’s services, Josh Rendell, broke local election purdah last week to call on the ULT takeover to be halted immediately. And the executive director of children’s services, Sarah Newman, issued a statement criticising the lack of communication between the school and parents. “Over recent months there have been many reports of problematic and rowdy behaviour of students outside the school,” she said. “Last week a child was harmed, and a teacher was taken seriously ill. This week a teacher has left the school in tears and more than 200 pupils were involved in a riot to protest the future plans being made about their school and to express their concern about their teachers. The situation has now escalated to such a level that the council is calling for immediate intervention by the Department for Education.” In its white paper, the government hinted that local authorities might now be encouraged to have a stronger role in any new academy arrangements, which is why local campaigners are puzzled that the Kensington Aldridge academy bid was not seen as a good option. A spokesperson for KAA said it believed that its own bid to form a partnership with Holland Park and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea was compelling. “We wanted to address the historic problems in the school, which we understood well given the number of Holland Park students who join our sixth form. We also wanted to keep the leadership and governance of Holland Park local and preserve the distinctive identity of the school.” A spokesperson for the DfE said that one of the conditions of the notice to improve was that the school should consider joining a multi-academy trust. “The school’s existing trust board has followed a thorough process and concluded that the best multi-academy trust to support the school’s needs is United Learning,” he said. “They are now undertaking a period of stakeholder engagement, including with parents, before a formal proposal is submitted to the department.” And a spokesperson for the Holland Park school governing body said that there were exceptionally serious issues at the school that dated back many years and led to the appointment of a new trustee (governing) board last year. “The trustees gave all bids serious consideration before identifying United Learning as its preferred provider as they believe it is the strong, expert Mat that will give the school the support it needs. “We are aware some parents do not agree with this. There are also many who desperately want action taken. The governors’ priority and guiding principle is to make sure the school is again fit for purpose and providing the first-class education that students have a right to expect. It is simply not possible for this to be achieved without significant, long-overdue change. “The final decision on the school’s future will be taken by the government. The governors will make no recommendation until after the end of the stakeholder engagement process. This process is an opportunity for all interested parties to have their say, whether they are in favour of the proposal or not.”",News/Education,‘Pupils are distressed’: community fights top London school’s takeover,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/03/pupils-are-distressed-community-fights-top-london-schools-takeover
5/4/2022,"‘We’re backing Britain,” declared BP’s chief executive, Bernard Looney, on Tuesday, which was a cuter spin on record quarterly profits of $6.2bn (£5bn) than his boast last November about running “a cash machine”. A debate about windfall taxes has raged ever since last autumn’s remark, which, note, was made when oil prices were $20-a-barrel lower than today’s. But here’s a key point about BP’s plan to spend “up to” £18bn in the UK by the end of the decade in a programme spanning North Sea oil and gas, offshore wind, hydrogen facilities, electric vehicle charging points and carbon capture projects: it’s not new. The collection of projects is merely a tally of previously announced plans, some of which were backed even when BP’s cashpoint was suffering a relative splutter. The big offshore wind programme in the Irish Sea, for example, was unveiled 15 months ago. At the margin, some North Sea oil and gas investments may have been accelerated, but it’s hard to be precise. The big picture is that BP has carefully shifted over time from investing about 10%-15% of its global capital expenditure in the UK, which was the approximate position over the past decade, to spending roughly 15%-20%. The change makes sense. In the renewables arena, where more of the cash is going, the UK’s tax and incentive set-up is seen as more attractive than that of international peers. Thus, from a purely economic perspective, BP’s £18bn parade of projects shouldn’t change the windfall tax debate one jot. The investments would happen anyway – a point Looney more or less conceded. Indeed, just by considering the back-of-the-envelope arithmetic, one can see why the financial dial wouldn’t move. The little secret about the Labour party’s version of windfall tax is that it is very modest. The formula imagines an increase from 40% to 50% in the tax rate on North Sea oil and gas profits, which in BP’s case would merely turn an expected £1bn tax bill for the relevant assets this year into one of £1.25bn. An extra £250m would not explode BP’s precious “long-term financial framework”, which has already withstood the mega Rosneft write-off and will stay pay investors £4bn in dividends this year, with possibly the same again via share buybacks. BP’s 10-year investment plans would not be upset; pensioners and pension funds would not be impoverished; life would go on. By the same token, though, Labour should stop giving the impression that a windfall tax is some form of cure-all for the crisis in consumers’ energy bills. On the party’s original January formulation of its tax, the projected total from across the entire North Sea industry was just £1.2bn. Even if one assumes that a higher oil price (and thus corporate profits) would add a bit, we’re not talking about game-changing sums. For context, it would cost £10bn to give 10m lower-income households a £1,000 saving on their bills for a single year. In the end, the politics of a windfall tax will probably hinge on how long oil remains at $100-plus a barrel, and how long an effective “Ukraine war premium” persists, as argued here last week. After a while, the charge becomes hard to resist. The view here is that it would be reasonable already for the Treasury to claim a few extra quid in the interest of fairness. But let’s not pretend that a windfall tax would make the energy crisis go away. As with most things Chinese and corporate, it’s hard to know if local insurer Ping An has been prodded by Beijing to lobby HSBC to break itself up. Either way, this show should run a while. First, because Ping An is a serious shareholder with a 8% stake. Second, because there’s a good question at the heart: would HSBC be better off if it split its Asian and western operations? As it is, HSBC’s double life as a UK-regulated bank that makes most of its money in Hong Kong has rarely looked so challenged. Executives have to engage in verbal gymnastics every time Beijing launches another crackdown on dissidents in Hong Kong, for example. Further deterioration in US-China relations may eventually make the act impossible to perform. On the other hand, Ping An’s apparent belief that a liberated Asian operation would enjoy a higher stock-market rating looks questionable; it ain’t necessarily so. But the Chinese group will perform a useful service if it makes HSBC’s chairman, Mark Tucker, and its chief executive, Noel Quinn, sing for their supper. The bank has been a disappointment to its shareholders – eastern and western alike – for years.",News/Business,Windfall tax wouldn’t stop BP’s £18bn parade of projects,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/may/03/windfall-tax-debate-bp-profits-labour
5/4/2022,"There has been a fair amount of fretting about the prospect of Ben Stokes, England Test captain. Even after a weary Joe Root called him before Easter to explain he was stepping down from the job, his wife, Clare, immediately said “oh no, oh no, oh no”, knowing full well what was likely to follow. Yet as Stokes strolled into the Colin Milburn Lounge at Durham’s Riverside Ground on Tuesday, decked out in grey-blue England training gear and that fiery red hair slicked back like a Peaky Blinder, he looked like a man at peace with the promotion. This may be an almighty Hail Mary from English cricket, one that heaps even more responsibility on to the shoulders of a champion all-rounder who needed a spell out of the game last year, but you would scarcely have known it. Indeed, over the next 20 minutes or so Stokes spoke with impressive assuredness. Had he coveted the role? Not at all, but he would never turn it down either. Did he still need time to decide when Rob Key, the new director of men’s cricket, offered him the role? A little, he said, which turned out to be barely a minute. Can he yank the handbrake on a team who have won just one of their past 17 Tests? The only way is up, Stokes replied, unwittingly channelling his inner Yazz and the Plastic Population. Even the Bristol incident in 2017, a subject Stokes has not always enjoyed engaging with publicly, was met with good grace. “Back then, no, I’d have never pictured sitting at a table speaking as England captain,” he said. That night on the tiles is not the only such brush with career seppuku along the way, having been thrown off a Lions tour in 2013 for drinking; the unfulfilled talent of Matt Coles, the other player sent packing by Andy Flower that day, shows what easily could have been. But while Stokes may be as raw a captain as England have had in the team’s 145-year history – the first Test against West Indies in 2020, when Root was on paternity leave, remains his only first-class match in charge – he believes these experiences will serve to inform his leadership positively; so, too, a rollercoaster playing career that has featured the crushing low of that horror last over in the 2016 World T20 final and those immortalising twin peaks of Lord’s and Headingley in 2019. And then there is the spell out last year for mental health reasons; the “dark place” that related to the grief of losing his father, Ged, months earlier and was triggered by a finger injury as he tried to plough on. Aside from the unsuccessful past tenures of Ian Botham and Andrew Flintoff, and the demands of captaining as an all-rounder – “I’ve had to deal with those comparisons since I was 18,” he said with a shrug – that four-month absence is the main source of angst regarding his succession of Root. But for Stokes, who revealed he is still in regular contact with a therapist, the spell out was a show of strength. “The hardest thing to do in the first place is to talk to somebody,” he said, adding that any player in similar strife could come to him. Asked how his old man, a teak-tough New Zealand rugby league international back in the day, would react to his son captaining England, he replied: “He followed me everywhere and thought he knew better than me. If he was still around, he’d be telling me how to do this job already. But yeah, he’d be very, very proud.” Stokes inherited his father’s headstrong character and, by his own admission, has tended to go with his gut in the past. But the 30-year-old has clearly put a lot of thought into his style of leadership: he wants players to follow his selfless, team-first approach, never dwell too heavily on failure and take the positive option where possible. There was also an insistence that senior players chip in tactically, not least as regards when best to bowl himself, and quipped that his timekeeping on the field will also need some help given he never usually knows when the intervals are. And though there is a head coach still to be hired and a squad to be selected before the first Test against New Zealand on 2 June, Stokes has already taken some tactical decisions: as well as demanding Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad be returned to fold, he will also drop down to No 6 in the batting order. He intends to play a full role with bat and ball, not simply focus on the former, and believes the extra breathing space will help here. It looks a sound call, even if the knock-on effect – Jonny Bairstow either moving to No 5 and nudging out a hopeful, or returning behind the stumps and Ben Foakes once again steps aside – is yet to be settled. There is plenty more to ponder besides before Stokes walks out for the toss at Lord’s; even his own fitness after a knee issue needs to be ticked off, starting with a return to face Worcestershire this Thursday. He also acknowledged the low ebb from which England start out, insisting it has “not been good enough”. Having made Test cricket his priority, he also hopes expectations will be tempered a touch while he, Key and the incoming head coach get to work on long-term solutions. There are no guarantees of success or that the concerns about overburdening the team’s talisman won’t come to pass. Nevertheless, this was a positive first outing from Ben Stokes, England Test captain. Like Durham, celebrating 30 years as a first-class county this summer, he has come a long way in a short space of time.",Sport/Sport,Impressive Ben Stokes passes first exam as England’s Test captain | Ali Martin,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/03/impressive-ben-stokes-passes-first-exam-as-englands-test-captain
5/4/2022,"Covid fines should be overturned en masse in light of the prime minister’s defence for attending lockdown-breaching events, a lawyer has argued, as it emerged more than 20 penalties imposed on businesses had been struck down in recent months. Lucinda Nicholls, who successfully represented 23 firms and is still fighting on behalf of seven more, said serious deficiencies in the evidence presented against her clients – as well as Boris Johnson’s own apparent confusion about how to apply his own rules – called every penalty imposed under Covid legislation into question. “Boris Johnson said he found the regulations confusing. Considering they changed about 12 times, it is understandable someone might be confused,” she said. The lawyer, from the firm Nicholls & Nicholls, added: “In the context of Partygate, the government should be overhauling all of the Covid fines issued to individuals and businesses. “If the government that brought in the legislation had difficulties with regard to the exemptions and the defences, then that demonstrates that there is clearly going to be confusion among the local authorities and the police in relation to enforcement.” Gainz Fitness & Strength, an independent gym in Bedford, was one of the firms Nicholls represented. Its owner, Alex Lowndes, risked being penalised when he decided to stay open in November 2020. He felt so strongly about the issue that he had campaigned – albeit unsuccessfully – for the inclusion of a special, blanket lockdown exemption for gyms that same month. The BBC, which first reported on the overturning of the 23 penalties, said Lowndes denied breaching lockdown regulations when charged following a raid on his gym. The broadcaster said he faced a £10,000 fixed-penalty notice and was due to stand trial last March. But the council failed to gather sufficient evidence and its request for an adjournment was rejected by magistrates. Nicholls had argued on Lowndes’ behalf that his gym should benefit from the exemptions that were eventually included in the rules. Data released by the National Police Chiefs Council in March showed police in England and Wales issued 877 notices under business regulations – such as that given to Lowndes – while more than 100,000 were imposed on people over various other allegations. Yet more have been handed out by local councils. Nicholls said there was no prospect of appeal where the penalty had been paid, since this represented an admission of guilt, and said ministers should act to ensure all were overturned. Bedford borough council, which gave Lowndes a fixed-penalty notice, said regulations were enforced in line with its duty at the time. “We brought this case because there was ample evidence for a successful prosecution following the non-payment of a fixed-penalty notice and because it was in the public interest,” a council spokesperson told the BBC. “It is important that we remember that the threat posed by the virus then was very different to that which we face now. “The pandemic isn’t over but the combination of immunity from prior infection, vaccinations and antivirals has made it possible for us to return cautiously to the activities that we love.”",News/World news,"Partygate means all Covid fines should be overturned, lawyer argues",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/partygate-means-covid-fines-should-be-overturned-lawyer-argues
5/4/2022,"A frontrunner to be the next Metropolitan police commissioner has said she will not apply, leaving a former top cop turned thriller-writer as one of the favourites for the role. Lynne Owens was the previous director general of the National Crime Agency and stood down last year to focus on her treatment for cancer. On Tuesday she wrote on Twitter that she had spent weeks considering whether to apply for the post of Britain’s top officer, but her decision was not health related. Applications close on Wednesday for the £290,000-a-year post, which became vacant after the resignation of Cressida Dick following a series of scandals. Owens was an assistant commissioner in the Met, and then became the chief constable of Surrey. There she succeeded Mark Rowley, who has now emerged as one of the frontrunners to be Met commissioner. Rowley is a former head of counter-terrorism, who left policing in 2018. In the meantime, he has worked in the private sector, co-authored a report on extremism, and recently co-authored a thriller based on a female detective fighting terrorist violence. Also likely to apply is Shaun Sawyer, the chief constable of the Devon and Cornwall force, who has previously served as a commander in Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command. Since Dick’s departure was announced in February, potential applicants have been in touch with officials at the Home Office and the London mayor’s office. The next commissioner will be appointed by the home secretary, Priti Patel, who by law has to take account of the views of London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, who is also the police and crime commissioner for London. Both government and City Hall believe the Met needs radical reform to boost falling public confidence, sapped by a series of scandals and concern about how the force’s leadership dealt with them. Officials are said to be interested in an application from Andy Marsh, chief executive of the College of Policing, which sets standards for law enforcement. He has been the chief constable of Avon and Somerset and, before that, the Hampshire force. Among senior officers in the Met, assistant commissioner Nick Ephgrave, also another former chief constable of Surrey, may be considering a run. Matt Jukes, head of counter-terrorism and former chief of South Wales police, has also been considering applying. But he may sit this competition out and be a strong contender to be deputy commissioner and the heir apparent next time. Assistant commissioner Neil Basu, once seen as a strong contender to succeed Dick, has been discouraged by reports the government dislikes him for his comments on race, and is expected not to apply. He would have been the first ethnic minority Met commissioner. But he is understood to be among the final two candidates to be the next director general of the NCA. The process to appoint to this role is taking longer than expected, and the final two candidates are yet to go through the final stage, which is an interview with Patel. Owens’ decision not to apply means the field is likely to be male and white. Olivia Pinkney, chief constable in Hampshire, is not applying, and Lucy D’Orsi, chief of British Transport Police and before that a Met veteran, only recently took charge of the force that patrols Britain’s railways. Applications will be sifted to create a shortlist of four or five candidates, it is believed, with interviews scheduled for three weeks’ time. The would-be Met commissioners will have to complete interactive assessments and other tests. The deadline for @metpoliceuk Commissioner applications is tomorrow. To prevent speculation & in the interests of transparency I’m not applying.

5/4/2022,"Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Better Call Saul season six, which airs on Netflix in the UK. Do not read on unless you have watched episodes one to four. Where is Lalo? That’s the question everyone, including the viewer, is asking at the end of this brisk, unsettling episode which cranks up the tension again after last week’s moment of (tragic) catharsis. The person pondering the hardest is Gus Fring, who has decided he needs to live in two houses at once, such is the threat from his Salamanca arch enemy. In one home, the normal Fring set-up; nice kitchen, all his clothes folded neatly and stored in industrial quantities in plastic tubs. In the second home, connected to the first by a secret tunnel, there’s a decoy family and a security team watching possible approaches to house one from every conceivable angle. The conceit is set up in a gentle, incongruous cold open where we’re left to wonder quite what is going on (just one of many nice touches in this episode, directed by Rhea Seehorn, who plays Kim). It seems fair to say that Mike is puzzled, too. He’s put security everywhere he can think of, and some more places on top, but still the customarily cool Gus is freaking out over a guy everyone else believes is dead. We all know that Gus’s assumption about Lalo is correct. We’re not used to seeing him this rattled (and this old … sorry but the suspension of disbelief continues to be difficult!), although it’s easy to sympathise with the Chicken Man because we have no clue where Lalo is, either. Four episodes in and we’ve had precisely two scenes featuring the show’s biggest bad guy. His absence is not making the heart grow fonder. It’s making it far more scared. Gus’s belief in Lalo’s continuing existence, and fear over the consequences, is shared by another criminal mastermind – Kim Wexler. Just joking – for now, as Kim hasn’t entirely broken bad just yet. But after sussing that she has been tailed, and confronting her stalkers, she is filled in on the Lalo situation by Mike, who thinks she is the only part of the Wexler McGill partnership who could handle the news without melting down. Melt down she doesn’t, but it seems clear that Kim believes the possibility of Lalo being alive should be taken seriously and, also, that it frightens her. We get that from the 15 seconds we spend with Kim, as she composes herself after Mike’s departure. By the end of the episode, however, she has recovered enough to indulge Jimmy in his little moment of validation-seeking; telling him why his new office is a good choice, and refraining from mentioning Lalo. Kim might well have chosen not to fill Jimmy in on his friend in the cartel because, as Mike observed, he couldn’t handle the truth. Furthermore, she probably chose not to harsh Jimmy’s mellow, as he does his best to make out he’s happy about being known by everyone in Albuquerque’s criminal law circles as the Salamancas’ man. The upside to this is a load of new clients, too many to be catered for in one nail salon. But there is one small downside – everyone at court thinks he is a scumbag. As his nerdy rival, deputy DA Bill Oakley puts it: “You scammed the court … it’s just wrong.” And, while Jimmy might be willing to fall back on some legalistic explanation for why he’s not a guilty party in the conspiracy that saw “Jorge de Guzman” fly the coop, Bill is having none of it. “There’s proving and then there’s knowing,” he says. So, Jimmy’s reputation is burned and Kim has probably guessed as much, given the enthusiasm with which he’s leaning into his new criminal client base. And, all this is happening while the pair are busy stealing cars in order to frame an innocent man as a drug user and consort of sex workers. Kim is a cigarette paper’s width away from Jimmy’s world now and the irony is that it is happening just as she has persuaded Clifford Main that her crusade for justice for the excluded is something worth investing in. Lucky for Kim, then, that she’s as tough as Mike says she is. Rhea Seehorn’s directorial debut is an impressive one. We get moments of intense, almost theatrical emotion from both Kim and Gus, and perfectly played slapstick in the car park of Howard’s therapist. As mentioned, the cold open is odd to the point of eerie, adding another dramatic tone to the mix. Then there are tonnes of clever details too, such as the aerial shot that pans along the courthouse cafeteria before settling on solo diner Jimmy. All in a crisp 43-minute runtime, too. Another Breaking Bad threshold has been crossed as Jimmy has found Saul’s office space. Still, no backdrop of the constitution or floating Statue of Liberty just yet. Just an unplumbed toilet sitting in the middle of the space (perhaps Jimmy takes it out and gold-plates it). “The wicked flee when no man pursueth”: it’s a line made familiar from the pre-season trailer, but one that doesn’t really stand up to scrutiny. Not only was Kim not trying to flee her tails (she confronts them), but bad guys in BCS tend to stand their ground. Gus is a criminal hiding in plain sight and Lalo doesn’t seem at all bothered about the attentions of the criminal justice system.

5/4/2022,"Britain’s cost of living crisis has another potent symbol: Elsie, a 77-year-old woman who found the cheapest way to keep warm was to switch the heating off, leave home and ride the buses all day using her pensioner’s freedom pass. Her story left Boris Johnson once again flailing in the face of everyday hardship. According to the prime minister’s interviewer, the Good Morning Britain TV presenter Susanna Reid, Elsie’s gas and electricity bill had soared from £17 to £85 a month. She was losing weight, having already cut down to just one meal a day, and shopped only in the late afternoons when price-reduced “yellow sticker” items came on sale. Elsie’s was just one of many “choices” that viewers told the programme they had been forced to make as they struggled with static incomes and rising costs, and there was not a lot more to be scrimped and saved. “What else should Elsie cut back on?” Reid asked the prime minister. “I don’t want Elsie to cut back on anything,” replied Johnson. But he had little else to offer Elsie, who already received a warm home discount and did not qualify for a council tax rebate. Johnson boasted he had introduced the freedom pass. “So, Elsie should be grateful to you for her bus pass?” asked Reid frostily. The exchange, according to Age UK’s charity director, Caroline Abrahams, showed the government had “no clear answers” for millions of pensioners who struggle when huge price increases overwhelm their fixed incomes. “Not good enough,” she tweeted. Labour called for a windfall tax on energy companies to cut fuel bills. The consumer finance journalist Martin Lewis said Reid’s question powerfully highlighted how he, as a compiler of ingenious cost savings hacks for consumers, had run out of options and political intervention was now needed. “I pray the PM goes back to No 10 & ruminates on Elsie’s plight,” Lewis tweeted. Taking long, cheap rides on night buses around the capital has long been an informal way of young homeless people ensuring they have somewhere to sleep, at least for a couple of hours at a time, but the public transport system is not especially known for offering a mobile living room service for pensioners. Age UK was not aware of any one else who had used their freedom pass like Elsie. But it said it had received “lots” of accounts of pensioners drastically cutting back: turning off the heating, skipping meals or cancelling social activities, or even babysitting for grandchildren. Haydn Watkins, 85, of Vernham Dean in Hampshire, said he was not yet at the point of desperation. “Am I managing? I’m probably halfway along the ‘managing’ spectrum,” he said. “I’m above the poverty line. But there is a sense things are going to get worse.” Watkins has a state pension and a small teaching pension. From this comes an annual council tax bill of nearly £2,000. Electricity bills take more than 10% of his income. He is happy with eating two simple meals a day. But with below-inflation pension increases this year and rising bills in the offing, it was hard to see things getting easier soon. For others, there was little scope for scrimping and saving. Rachel cares for her husband, who is bedbound and has Alzheimer’s, washing and changing him three times a day, with the washer and dryer in constant use. Her fuel bills are currently £270 a month, and because of her husband’s health they cannot be cut. UK pensioner poverty had been falling since the early 2000s, said Christopher Brooks, Age UK’s head of policy, but it has seen a resurgence in recent years. The charity estimates one in six pensioners are in poverty (equivalent to about 2 million people) and their purchasing power is declining. “There is a need to do something over the next few months to help older people to cope with price rises. We have been calling for a £500 one-off payment, paid to the same cohort of pensioners who received cold weather payments. This would cover most of the shortfall in the energy bills this year,” said Brooks.",News/Business,Woman who rides bus to stay warm is tip of pensioner poverty iceberg ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/03/stories-like-elsies-highlight-pensioners-plight-and-the-inadequate-help
5/4/2022,"If the supreme court overturns Roe v Wade, as a leaked draft opinion indicates, it will be a crushing blow to the fundamental right of women in the United States to control their own bodies. It is the grim culmination of a crusade by zealots, against the will of the majority, to risk the health, happiness and lives of women. An accelerating erosion of rights and services has already slashed access to abortions, and many feared that Donald Trump’s judicial legacy would be the curtailment or reversal of the 1973 ruling, which effectively legalised abortion nationally. But this text, obtained by Politico and written by Justice Samuel Alito, looks worse than expected. Excoriating Roe v Wade as “egregiously wrong from the start”, it abandons the issue to states – nearly half of which have, or will soon have, laws banning abortion. Such a decision will force women to give birth in a country with high maternal mortality rates and no national paid maternity leave; it will risk lives as they access illegal abortions; it will threaten to criminalise vulnerable women and those who help them (and even those who have miscarriages); it will push yet more children into poverty. Experts warn that states are likely to pass further restrictions targeting those who travel to obtain abortions, or order medication to manage their abortions at home. These days there are new ways for women to obtain abortions, but also new ways to track them, and those supporting them. Overturning the five-decades-old decision could also help to pave the way for a nationwide abortion ban. Moreover, it throws into doubt other established rights, such as gay marriage, which are similarly rooted in the right to privacy. Though it states that it does not do so – arguing that abortion is a unique issue because it involves the right to life or potential life – that is little reassurance. After all, two of the justices backing this decision were confirmed after describing Roe v Wade as “settled law”. This catastrophic decision, assuming it proceeds, both highlights and solidifies the gulf between different Americas. First, the geographical division between states that ban abortion – home to the majority of women – and those that do not. Second, the socioeconomic and racial divide between those whose wealth and connections will allow them to access abortion, and the rest. Finally, it captures the gulf between American public opinion and the institutions that have been captured by the right because the electoral college, the Senate and supreme court are all skewed in favour of Republicans. A poll in January found that only 30% of voters wanted to see Roe v Wade overturned; 69% were opposed. The move is also strikingly out of step with the rest of the world. With a few exceptions – notably Poland – the trend has been overwhelmingly towards the liberalisation of abortion laws, including in countries such as Chile and Ireland. The UN special rapporteur on the right to health, Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng, has warned that overturning abortion rights would set a dangerous precedent, as well as violate international human rights treaties, including the convention against torture. But this decision, of course, can only be fixed at home. Democrats demand the codification of Roe v Wade, knowing that it would require overturning the filibuster, a Senate procedural rule. Calls for supreme court reform will gain ground, with the introduction of term limits a more straightforward move than expanding the court. Beyond the immediate crisis is the greater challenge of fixing a political system now tilted decisively towards Republicans through the systematic pursuit of power, from gerrymandering to voter suppression to control of elections themselves. The right’s victory is the fruit of an orchestrated campaign over decades; the fightback will demand equal ferocity and commitment. This blow could yet help to create some of the momentum required. November’s midterms will be the first test.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on overturning Roe v Wade: a human rights catastrophe | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/03/the-guardian-view-on-overturning-roe-v-wade-a-human-rights-catastrophe
5/4/2022,"Nowhere in the world has a party commanded a nation longer than Labour in Wales. Barring an upset in local council elections this week, Labour will celebrate a century of dominance come November. The party holds a majority in a third of Welsh councils. The expectation is that this Thursday it will win another 100 seats and take back control of two extra councils. Things looked very different in 2019, when voters turned from Labour to the Conservatives as the “red wall” began to crumble in north Wales. Since then, the mood has soured for the Tories. The cautious approach of the Labour first minister, Mark Drakeford, during the pandemic contrasted with that of the prime minister, Boris Johnson. While these are local Welsh elections, the UK’s national politics is never far from voters’ minds. Labour’s poll ratings are far ahead of the Tories. Brexit captured a nationalist sentiment in Wales – but one that Mr Drakeford has turned to Labour’s advantage. Cardiff University’s Richard Wyn Jones, Jac Larner and Daniel Wincott found that feelings of Welshness had become more intense since 2016, and simultaneously voters rejected any diminution of devolved powers in the name of leaving the EU. In last year’s Senedd elections, anti-devolution parties collapsed without producing an equal-sized increase in vote share for the Tories. Nationalist forces have brought Labour low in England and Scotland. But not in Wales. Independence here is a language movement and Mr Drakeford, like his predecessors, is a fluent Welsh speaker. Labour’s electoral coalition spans both nationalism and unionism. This politics was forged in Labour’s heartland of the south Wales valleys, which have a rich history of workers’ institutes and nonconformist churches. English jostled alongside the Welsh language. Today, this region is where almost a third of the Welsh population lives. Plaid Cymru, which backs independence, appears to have flatlined. The party takes votes from an electorate that feels very Welsh and not at all British. For the Tories, the opposite holds. The signing of a cooperation agreement between Labour and Plaid Cymru in the Senedd last year has already seen a more distinctively Welsh policy programme emerge. ​​Probably the most eye-catching is that some second-home owners could pay four times their current level of council tax from next year to prevent house prices becoming unaffordable for the locals. Mr Drakeford, unlike his Scottish counterpart, lacks control over justice and welfare spending. The Senedd is likely to usurp Westminster’s authority in these areas in the years ahead. It can already vary income taxes. In 1997, Wales voted for devolution by a margin of 50.3%, one of the narrowest victories in British electoral history. Remarkably, Welsh Labour has been able to straddle – and even close – this divide. It is a lesson the party elsewhere in Britain should learn from.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Welsh local elections: Labour is seeing off nationalism | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/03/the-guardian-view-on-welsh-local-elections-labour-is-seeing-off-nationalism
5/4/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is inflicting damage to the country’s infrastructure at a cost of $4.5bn (£3.6bn) a week as bombs tear through thousands of buildings and public utilities, and miles of road. According to estimates compiled by the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE), and supported by the Ukrainian government, the total amount of direct infrastructure damage has reached $92bn since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion in February. Academics said the figure rose by almost $4.5bn in the week to 2 May, adding that their estimate is probably lower than the true cost because losses from the war are hard to quantify. With losses since the invasion having risen to about 60% of annual economic output, the researchers said Ukraine was suffering heavy damage to infrastructure that will be expensive to repair or rebuild. The KSE said its project, Russia Will Pay, was based on analysis of thousands of reports of damage caused during the invasion, which have been submitted by citizens, government agencies and local authorities. The snapshot showed that the bulk of the infrastructure costs relate to bomb damage inflicted on buildings, roads, factories and businesses, based on the open-source data project to track the cost of the war. More than 33,000 sq metres of residential buildings have been hit by missiles, bombs and suffered other damage during the war, worth almost $30bn in total. More than 23,000km of road have been ripped up or pockmarked by shelling, and almost 90,000 cars, worth billions of dollars combined, have been damaged. The KSE said the overall economic costs of the war – when damage to infrastructure is taken with the impact on GDP, the cessation of investments and the outflow of workers as millions flee the country – could rise to $600bn, almost four times the value of annual GDP. The figures compare with estimates made by the World Bank in mid-April, which suggested that physical infrastructure worth about $60bn had been damaged, a figure that was expected to continue rising. Last month, the International Monetary Fund said Ukraine’s economy would probably contract by about 35% this year, while the loss of life, destruction of infrastructure and exodus of workers would severely impede its economy for many years to come, even if the war ended soon. Boris Johnson, who addressed the Ukrainian parliament on Tuesday, suggested in March that Ukraine might need a “new Marshall plan”, referring to the US aid package used after the second world war to help rebuild the economies of Europe. The IMF has provided $1.4bn in emergency financing to help meet Ukraine’s immediate spending needs, while the World Bank is mobilising financial support worth about $2.5bn.",News/World news,Russia’s war in Ukraine ‘causing £3.6bn of building damage a week’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/russias-war-in-ukraine-causing-36bn-of-building-damage-a-week
5/4/2022,"A pizza shop owner has been convicted of murdering his wife and burying her body in an unmarked grave that police did not discover for more than six months, despite extensive searches. Nezam Salangy, 44, was found guilty at Worcester crown court of killing 28-year-old Zobaidah Salangy, his wife of eight years, on 28 March 2020 then burying her in woodland near Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, under cover of darkness. Zobaidah’s body was missed by police during an initial search of the area in April 2020 as they failed to dig deep enough, the court heard. As a result of the delay, it was impossible to determine the exact cause of her death, the prosecution said. Salangy’s younger brothers, Mohammed Yasin Salangi, 34, and 31-year-old Mohammed Ramin Salangy, were convicted alongside him of helping to cover up the crime. The younger brother travelled 90 miles by taxi from his and Yasin’s home in Cardiff to help bury the victim. Yasin assisted in the crime by covering up knowledge of the killing and the unmarked burial, proved by telephone evidence. Nezam Salangy later reported his wife missing to police, telling them “she had gone out for a run and never come back”, after leaving him for a “new boyfriend”, prosecutors said. As he left the dock accompanied by security guards, Nezam Salangy stared for several seconds at six West Mercia police detectives who had conducted the investigation, telling them: “You guys framed me”. One of his brothers, as he was led down the stairs to the court cells, said: “That’s the wrong decision.” Shortly after the three men were led downstairs, the court security alarm was triggered. None had chosen to give evidence during the trial. During the six-week trial, the court heard that after Nezam Salangy was arrested on 4 April 2020, he told officers he “was confident his wife was still alive and would return home”. During an initial search of woodland near the Worcestershire village of Lower Bentley, police mistook “a hard layer of soil that they reached to be a natural base below which no one would dig”, prosecuting barrister Simon Denison QC said. They abandoned the search but, “convinced she must be there”, returned to the spot in October 2020 and found Zobaidah’s body bound in curtain wire and wrapped in black bin bags and a duvet cover that matched pillow cases found at the couple’s house in Bromsgrove. The prosecution told jurors that on 27 March, the day before Zobaidah’s disappearance, the couple had “argued bitterly” and that part of the row was video recorded by Nezam Salangy on his phone. In the recording, both said “that their relationship was over”. The prosecuting barrister, Simon Denison QC, said “Zobaidah Salangy vanished off the face of the earth” the next day. Jurors heard Zobaidah had been a maths teacher in Afghanistan and that her November 2012 nuptials to Nezam Salangy, then already living in the UK, had been an arranged marriage. She moved to the UK in October 2013 to live with Nezam Salangy, and was attending English classes at a night school twice a week, intending to either resume maths teaching or become a midwife. Nezam Salangy, Yasin Salangi and Ramin Salangy will be sentenced in June.",News/UK news,Worcestershire pizza shop owner found guilty of murdering and burying his wife ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/03/nezam-salangy-found-guilty-of-murdering-and-burying-his-wife
5/4/2022,"At least 10 people have died and 15 are wounded after Russian forces shelled a coke plant in the city of Avdiivka, in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, has passed a law that bans political parties that justify, recognise or deny Russia’s armed aggression against Ukraine. Putin told Macron “western countries could help stop the crimes of the Ukrainian military”. Putin is also reported to have told Macron about the Russian approach to negotiations with Kyiv. Russia has launched an attack on the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, Ukraine, where 200 civilians remain trapped underground. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said that a convey of civilians evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant in besieged Mariupol has reached Zaporizhzhia. Germany’s opposition leader has travelled to Kyiv to meet Ukrainian officials, after the country’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, made clear he would not be visiting Ukraine any time soon. Addressing the Ukrainian parliament virtually on Tuesday, Boris Johnson said “Ukraine will win” against Russia, and “will be free”. Johnson was the first world leader to address the Verkhovna Rada since the conflict began. Moscow accused Israel of backing the “neo-Nazi regime in Kyiv”.

5/4/2022,"More than 200 Spanish mobile numbers were selected as possible targets for surveillance by an NSO Group client believed to be Morocco, according to the data leak at the heart of the Pegasus project. Details of the scale of the apparent targeting came as Spain’s highest criminal court opened an investigation into how the mobile phones of the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the defence minister, Margarita Robles, came to be infected with Pegasus spyware last year. The Spanish government has refused to speculate on who may have been behind the “illicit” and “external” attacks, the existence of which it revealed on Monday at a hastily called press conference. The targeting of the prime minister is alleged to have taken place in May and June last year – a particularly turbulent time in Spanish politics. Not only was the Sánchez administration preparing its controversial and deeply divisive pardons of nine Catalan independence leaders jailed over their parts in the failed secession attempt in 2017, Spain was also engaged in a tense diplomatic row with Morocco. The mobile number selections believed to have been made by Morocco occurred in 2019, according to time stamps in the data, which includes more than 50,000 numbers of individuals selected as possible surveillance targets by NSO clients around the world. A Spanish mobile number belonging to Aminatou Haidar, a prominent human rights activist from Western Sahara, was included in the leaked database and found to have been targeted by Pegasus dating back to 2018, according to an analysis by Amnesty International. Traces of the Pegasus spyware, which is sold by the Israeli company NSO Group, were also found on a second phone belonging to Haidar as recently as November 2021. A Spanish mobile number for the journalist Ignacio Cembrero – whose work is focused on the Maghreb – was also listed on the Pegasus project database. The inclusion of more than 200 Spanish mobile numbers selected by a client believed to be Morocco does not indicate that every number was targeted or hacked. But it signals the client was apparently active in seeking out possible targets for surveillance within Spain. NSO said the fact a number appeared on the leaked list was in no way indicative of whether a number was targeted for surveillance using Pegasus. NSO has also said the database had “no relevance” to the company. Morocco previously denied spying on any foreign leaders using Pegasus, and has said reporters investigating NSO were “incapable of proving [the country had] any relationship” with NSO. But an analysis of the leaked records showed Morocco appeared to have listed dozens of French officials as candidates for possible surveillance, including President Emmanuel Macron. NSO has said its spyware is only sold to government clients for the purposes of investigating serious crime and terrorism. It has said it investigates legitimate allegations of abuse and strongly denied Pegasus was ever used to target Macron. The attacks came to light as the Spanish government continued to face questions over how Pegasus was allegedly used to monitor dozens of members of the Catalan independence movement, including the president of the north-eastern Spanish region, Pere Aragonès, and three of his predecessors. The pro-independence Catalan regional government has pointed the finger at Spain’s national intelligence centre (CNI), which insists its operations are overseen by the supreme court and that it acts “in full accordance with the legal system, and with absolute respect for the applicable laws”. On Tuesday, a judge at Spain’s Audiencia Nacional announced the beginning of an inquiry into “a possible offence of the discovery and revelation of secrets” relating to the use of Pegasus to infect Sanchez’s and Robles’s devices. Recent media reports suggest the phone of a third politician – the then Spanish foreign minister, Arancha González Laya – was also targeted with some kind of spyware in May last year. The row between Spain and Morocco occurred after the Madrid government allowed Brahim Ghali, a Western Sahara independence leader, to be treated for Covid-19 in Spain. Over the following days, as more than 8,000 people crossed from Morocco to Spain’s north African enclave of Ceuta, Rabat’s ambassador in Madrid appeared to draw a line between Ghali’s treatment and the influx of migrants, warning that some actions had consequences that “need to be assumed”. At a weekly press conference in Madrid on Tuesday, the Spanish government’s spokesperson refused to comment on whether Morocco may have been behind the Pegasus attack, and on what effect such action could have on diplomatic relations. “It’s a bit hypothetical to talk about what the consequences could be – if we’re able to find out where the attack came from,” said Isabel Rodríguez. “But what we’re clear about is that this attack was external and illicit. Those are the certainties we can use to make decisions on at the moment.” The government has ruled out any internal spying, adding the targeting must have come from abroad as any such monitoring in Spain would have required judicial authorisation. Rodríguez said the government had nothing to hide and promised full collaboration with any judicial investigation, “including declassifying relevant documents should it prove necessary”. On Tuesday, Sánchez’s Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE) joined the three parties on the Spanish right in vetoing a parliamentary inquiry into the Pegasus scandal. A PSOE spokesperson said the mooted congressional committee was not needed as an internal investigation by Spain’s national intelligence centre was already under way, as was an inquiry by the public ombudsman. The decision did not go down well with the PSOE’s junior coalition partners in the far-left, anti-austerity Unidas Podemos alliance, nor with the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party (ERC) on whose support the minority government relies in parliament. Gabriel Rufián, the ERC’s spokesperson, described the use of Pegasus as “a major scandal” and said it needed to be investigated. The Pegasus project is an investigative collaboration involving 16 media partners including the Guardian, the Wire, the Washington Post and Le Monde, and is coordinated by the French non-profit Forbidden Stories.
