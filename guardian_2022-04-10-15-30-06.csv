4/10/2022,"Sydney Roosters have won the 2022 NRLW premiership, vanquishing the demons of NRLW grand final losses in 2018 and 2020, to come from behind and defeat St George Illawarra 16-4 at Moreton Daily Stadium in Redcliffe. The Dragons opened the scoring the first time they took possession in the second minute. Emma Tonegato’s fast catch-and-pass found winger Madison Bartlett on the fly. The Kiwi national, who was suspended in March on a biting charge, crossed in the corner to give the Red V an early 4-0 lead. Bartlett’s eighth four-pointer of the season extended her lead as the record try-scorer in NRLW history. The Jamie Soward-coached St George-Illawarra side had gone into the decider as firm favourites, their fine form all season capped off on Thursday when Dragons No 1, fullback Emma Tonegato, was awarded the Dally M Medal, a prize she shared with Broncos prop Millie Boyle. Things got worse for the Roosters in the 20th minute when winger Brydie Parker went down with a knee injury. To salt the wound, Parker copped a shoulder to the head as she fell, resulting in Dragons five-eighth Taliah Fuimaono being sent to the sin bin. In the shadows of half time, Dragons hooker Keeley Davis looked to have scored a freak try from a deflection from a kick, but the bunker ruled a knock-on in the lead-up to deny the four-pointer. The Dragons’ scramble defence came to the fore again six minutes later when Page McGregor denied Leianne Tufuga in the right hand corner. It left the Dragons with a slender 4-0 lead at the break. The underdog Roosters had only scraped into the semi-finals in fourth on points difference. But their huge upset victory in the semi, storming back from 16-0 down against reigning premiers and three-time NRLW champions Brisbane Broncos to make the grand final, was a warning the Dragons should’ve heeded. Within minutes of the resumption, the Tricolours were off the canvas when second-rower Yasmin Meakes crashed over from close range to lock up the scores at 4-4. With a crowd of 7855 riding every bump, jump and tackle, Roosters centres Isabelle Kelly and former Dally M winner Jessica Sergis lifted a gear and their hard work on the flanks sent Isabelle Kelly on a charge up the middle to break the deadlock and give the Roosters their first lead of the game. In putting the Roosters ahead at the 58-minute mark, Kelly became the first player to pass 2000 run metres, a feat which had never been achieved in the history of the NRLW. It was another jewel in Kelly’s stellar career of Dally M awards, Golden Boots and State of Origin series victories. However Kelly had said in the lead up to the grand final that she was over individual awards and wanted to taste the ultimate success by winning a first NRLW Grand Final with her teammates. And with a first ever try to hooker Olivia Higgins to push the lead out to 16-4, Kelly added NRLW premiership winner to her resume. With 158 metres, three tackle busts, an offload, a linebreak and eight tackles in the decider, Kelly won Women-of-the-Match. Close behind was her old rival, Emma Tonegato who capped a remarkable week by running for 206 metres from 24 runs In a consolation prize Tonegato was announced as the NRLW’s Players’ Champion at half-time. The peer-voted prize, RLPA boss Clint Newton said, was crystallised by Tonegato’s spectacular chase down tackle of Rooster Jess Sergis earlier in the season, a moment voted Tackle of the Year at Dally Ms. “It was an NRLW classic moment,” said Newton. “It left all rugby league fans wanting more; that moment and many others made her an incredibly worthy winner and the RLPA is proud to call her the Players’ Champion,” he said. “They may battle it out on the field in Australia’s hardest, most physical and skilful sport, but the players also have huge respect for each other, and every one of the players are essential to the competition’s success.”",Sport/Sport,Sydney Roosters defeat St George-Illawarra to win maiden premiership,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/10/sydney-roosters-defeat-st-george-illawarra-to-win-maiden-premiership
4/10/2022,"At my seventh birthday party, my mother – dreading, I imagine, the prospect of another formless afternoon of children rampaging, buttercream-smeared and high on Sunset Yellow and musical chairs, through our small house – hired an entertainer. This was the early 1980s, long before these things were common, so I remember it with all the wonder of uncynical childhood: there was a rabbit, and also a cake, conjured from a hat, but somehow more magical still, because we were allowed to keep them, balloon sculptures. I mean that in the most basic sense: sausage dogs and swords, mainly. Mine, though, as birthday girl, was a red rocking horse and I was enraptured. I recall taking a bath that night with it sitting on the side, and putting it by my bed. Its slow wrinkling and demise, after one rocker popped, caused me real grief. But now my rocking horse and its ilk are looking a bit saggy and wrinkled: our beloved blow-ups have had a glow-up. Animal sculptures are Old Balloon, along with the traditional packet of primary-coloured ovals, effortfully inflated and tied by apprehensive parents, pre-party, and just sort of tossed on the floor, perhaps rubbing one against a jumper to perform the never-not-funny static hair trick on a nearby child or tying a couple to the door knocker with string. Also Old Balloon: a single, or small bunch of foil “birthday girl”, “18 today” or L-plate helium-filled ones, dragged round streets and into bars, bobbing chaotically in the wake of a group of lairy revellers, eventually abandoned in a club queue, floating up, up and away. Nearly 200 years since Michael Faraday first floured two sheets of rubber, stuck them together and inflated while experimenting with hydrogen in 1824, the global balloon market is big business: it was valued at $647.3m in 2020 and is predicted to grow at an average of 4.2% until 2026. What’s fuelling this balloon bubble? For one thing, balloons have got a whole lot prettier: the kind of installations you can see on the 11.2m #balloon Instagram tag or scrolling through Pinterest – spiritual home of the tasteful inflatable – come in tumbling, organically shaped installations featuring multiple sizes and muted colours, accessorised with flowers and feathers and other decorative elements. There are swooshes and waterfalls in 50 shades of grey, from the “workhouse” end of the Farrow & Ball colour chart, or in café au lait, blush, bronze and tawny rose, like a contoured Kardashian. The Kardashians, unsurprisingly, have gone all-in on balloons: Khloe hosted an absolutely balloon-stuffed baby shower in February 2020, which is credited with taking contemporary balloon styling to the next level. The most popular arrangements currently come in “dusky, Scandi colours”, according to Sahar Kasiri of Elari Events, but this season (Elari presents its take on the season’s colours in autumn to coincide with the catwalk shows) will also be about Palm Springs-inspired “yellows and purples, saturated sunkissed brights”. They would know: Elari is the absolute OG of balloon art in the UK. “We were one of the first in the UK to take it to a very stylish, fashionable level,” Kasiri tells me. She and her business partner, Aleksandra Rabbani, have created balloon art for star-studded events for Vogue and a range of luxury brands, plus pretty much anyone from a scripted reality show who has thrown a party or a baby shower in the four-and-a-half years since they launched. Elari’s work is spectacular: lavish and elaborate, with lush use of colour, thanks to “double stuffing” – putting one balloon inside another before you inflate, to create a bespoke gradient of shades. “We do a lot of experimental work double stuffing with different colours,” Kasiri explains. “We double stuff all our balloons, we never use single colours.” The end results look vivid, airy and effortless, but they are the fruit of hard work, from planning and logistics to the toil of actually putting an installation together. “It’s very hectic; it’s a very physical job,” Kasiri says. “I’ve got to carry a lot of backdrops and blow up a lot of balloons to create these looks.” A modest installation in a home might take two to three hours of on-site blowing up and construction, in addition to the off-site prep time, double stuffing and loading. But who are the grownups who want to say it with, and indeed pay for, balloons? Tray and Pete invested in a “huge balloon cascade” to decorate the exterior of the pub where they held their wedding reception. “Invested” is the right word: the primary-coloured installation cost £690, but the pictures convey the real blast of joy it created. “It looked great,” Tray says. “And achieved what we wanted by dressing the pub up so it looked like something special was happening. The guests loved it and there were plenty of them taking photos with it in the background.” Kate, a civil servant, installed a white and gold balloon arch to celebrate her mother’s birthday. “I just love balloons,” she says. “They’re an over-the-top, guaranteed crowd-pleaser.” She’s a long-term balloon lover who has MS, so the fact that balloons are light is a key factor: “It means I can actually lift them.” You might think Covid – no parties (except in Downing Street), no proms, no fun at all – would have popped the balloon bubble. Quite the contrary. As Kasiri says: “People were still pregnant, they were still having birthdays, baby showers… although they didn’t invite guests, they still wanted a backdrop so people could attend on Zoom or pop into the garden.” Elari pivoted to contactless deliveries of bike-sized backdrops, as a balloon arrangement became the consolation prize; a cheer-up for a cancelled celebration rather than the inflatable icing on the cake. After all, nobody, as AA Milne said, can be uncheered by a balloon. Perhaps Milne had never met a globophobe: globophobia is the fear of balloons, and more particularly their popping. A mildly globophobic friend recalls a balloon-filled party with dread, as: “Horrible – that squeaky balloon squeak, then all the popping. I climbed on to the mantelpiece.” But balloons have become instant shorthand for “Gaiety, song-and-dance, here we are and there we are”, as Eeyore puts it, before learning his birthday balloon has popped, in Eeyore has a Birthday. That image of a cheerful, bobbing pop of colour in a grey world is enduringly popular in visual culture: think of Audrey Hepburn holding a primary-coloured bunch in Funny Face; the house in Disney’s Up or Jeff Koons’s colossal shiny canines. The Instagram “balloon guy”, artist Michael Schneider, creates slogans generating varying degrees of controversy from brightly coloured foil letters against a wall (his 2021 “Fuck nudes, send me a dated invoice from your therapist” went down like a lead, well, you know). Banksy’s Girl with a Balloon was even voted Britain’s favourite work of art in 2017 (much to the disgust of art critic Jonathan Jones, who called it “sentimental tosh”). Why does Kasari think we love balloons so much? “It brings out the kid in everyone,” she says. “There’s a feeling of nostalgia. Even when [clients] want it to be elegant, they love the idea of balloons.” Balloons aren’t gendered, she adds, they fill a space well and are “an easy thing to have around the house. A lot of things in decor can be quite subjective, but I feel like balloons are just balloons: it doesn’t offend anyone.” They do offend, though. Like glitter, and straws, balloons are not the innocent, harmless party pleasure we used to think they were. As the campaigning group Balloons Blow highlights, while rubber latex – from which most balloons are made – is theoretically biodegradable, the timescale is alarmingly long: the group’s “backyard biodegradability test” is currently running at more than seven years. Analysis of seabird mortality in 2019 found that although latex balloons were far from the most common plastic ingested by seabirds, they were responsible for a much higher percentage of deaths: 1 in 5 birds found with a balloon in its stomach died from it. “They are attractive and they are disproportionately deadly if those balloons are eaten,” said one of the authors, Lauren Roman of the Australian national science agency’s Marine Debris Research group, when the paper was released. There’s a whole additional set of problems when helium is involved (though many contemporary balloon structures are physically secured rather than dependent on helium to keep them afloat). Global reserves are dwindling alarmingly fast and helium has vital uses in medicine (not to mention being crucial for the functioning of the Large Hadron Collider). There are calls to ban its use for party purposes. I wonder if their ephemerality is part of the magic of balloons. Joy is fleeting, helium-light, fragile; so are balloons. But I also wonder if perhaps they are becoming less fragile, and whether that might make them less problematic. “We don’t actually pop a lot of our balloons now,” Kasiri tells me when I ask about what happens to their installations post-party. “We either offer it to the client if they want to keep it, or we keep it in our warehouse for environmental reasons. We tend to reuse some of the balloons and make sure there’s no wastage, because we use high-quality balloons.” My friend Helen’s experience corroborates this. She recently inherited a “10m-long” (possibly a slight exaggeration) Happy Birthday installation in balloon letters from a neighbour for her son’s birthday. Kept in a shed for six weeks, the balloons were, she said, “good as new” on the day. Afterwards, “I put it on the street WhatsApp group and they got about three more kid birthdays out of them. I would see parents trail the 10m happy birthday down the street in the night.” Like Eeyore, putting his popped balloon into his Useful Pot, and taking it out again, perhaps we can still have, and love, balloons, as long as we commit to keeping them.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Blow ups get a glow up: how balloons went posh,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/10/how-balloons-went-posh
4/10/2022,"“Cock your hat,” Frank Sinatra once observed, “angles are attitudes.” The two women in Regina Relang’s picture from the mid-50s have taken that advice to heart. Relang, a German photographer whose work was a fixture in Vogue and many other magazines for several decades, has constructed her picture like a scene from Desmond Morris’s The Human Zoo. The cafe, the coffee, the intimacy of the window seat speak of friendship and ease, but the beaky hat brims, the spiky eye makeup and the fall of light and shade suggest edgier, pecking-order forces of status and competition at play. That edge is dramatised by a singular fact: one woman has a rope of pearls, and a swan neck on which to drape them, and the other doesn’t. She holds her beads across the dividing line of a window frame and Cinzano ashtray in the white-gloved hand of a curator showing off the priceless goods: look but don’t touch. The open mouth and downcast eyes of her friend seem to suggest a mix of disdain or envy or desire; in this, she shares common ground with the magazine’s imagined reader and the animating impulse of all fashion images: I want what she’s got. Relang, who moved between Berlin and Paris before (and during) the war, was a pioneer of such playful narratives, the high-end storytelling of haute couture, which brought the models as well as their clothes (or hats) into sharper focus in the 1950s. She was self-taught and learned some of her dark-room technique from the celebrated war photographer Robert Capa. Her work is included in a new book and exhibition called Female View, which celebrates the women photographers who have challenged the “male gaze”, from the iconoclasts of the 1940s – Lee Miller, Madame d’Ora – to the self-dramatising Instagrammers of the present day.

4/10/2022,"Boris Johnson could end the inhumanity of Britain’s treatment of Ukrainian refugees today. He need only say that the UK will do what every European Union country has done and grant them temporary protection. No visa forms designed to catch you out. No insolent officials throwing up obstacles. Just come. You are welcome. Hungary is virtually a Putin puppet state, but had taken 530,000 Ukrainian refugees by the end of March. Ireland’s neutrality periodically disgraces it, but nevertheless it expects to house 30,000 by Easter. Hungary’s population is a seventh of the UK’s. Ireland’s less than a tenth. Yet, as of last week, the UK has accepted just 12,000 refugees. We are imposing visa restrictions because opposition to the free movement of Europeans has become a neurotic obsession for our ruling class. If we were not so in thrall to American notions that racism solely consists of white supremacy, we would recognise the lethal prejudice for what it is. For a generation, Europeans have been the British right’s “other”. The mythical European “superstate”, not the actual Russian empire, was the UK’s greatest enemy. Opposition to the explosion of immigration after Tony Blair’s government allowed freedom of movement to eastern Europeans gave victory to the right in the Brexit referendum of 2016 and general election of 2019. Even a terrible war cannot blow away the conviction that to win Conservatives must hammer European migrants. I want to emphasise the political nature of the decision to slam the door in Ukrainians’ faces. Too many people writing about the restrictions have lost themselves in the wilderness of the Home Office bureaucracy, from where few emerge with their sanity intact. But if Priti Patel and Johnson had ordered the civil service to drop restrictions on Ukrainians, it would have done so and got on with the arduous job of finding them accommodation. Instead, they calculated that maintaining rightwing support required spreading conspiracy theories as malicious as any they spin against people of colour. “White privilege” is a useless concept when dealing with the racism Europeans inflict on each other rather than on the descendants of their former colonial possessions. Worse than useless, in fact. In the run-up to the Brexit referendum and today, it allows the cynics in charge of our politics to plausibly deny that they are engaged in race-baiting. How can they be when their targets’ skins are white? Remember that the latest polling gives Labour a nine-point lead over the Conservatives on immigration. Rightwing opinion has been outraged by the Johnson administration’s failure to keep its impossible pledge to stop boats filled with asylum seekers crossing the Channel. Like David Cameron claiming a decade ago that he could reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, vainglorious boasts are eating away at Johnson’s support. When war began, the political imperative to stop migration from eastern Europe by any means necessary appeared overwhelming. For all that, demonising Ukrainian refugees challenged even this government’s dark storytellers. They were overwhelmingly women and children, whose men had stayed behind to fight. They were fleeing an unprovoked invasion, by – and since we were talking about colonialism – a fascistic imperial power. The world could see the crimes against humanity the Russians were inflicting on civilians. Undeterred, Patel insisted that among the desperate and traumatised were Russian spies. “I’m afraid it is naive and misguided to think that only men can be covert operatives,” she told a Conservative party conference last month. “There are those who would come to our country, who would mean us harm and who plot to strike at our very way of life.” Read that disgraceful justification for visa controls again and compare it with the Russian state’s attempt to brainwash its subjects into believing Ukrainians are Nazis. There is the same contempt for evidence. Patel does not say where she found Russian spies among the refugee exodus because she cannot. Note too the sheer implausibility of both claims. Why would Nazis create a free society with a Jewish leader? How could Russian intelligence benefit from smuggling a mother of two into the spare room of a Northamptonshire rectory? Nothing made sense apart from Patel’s warning against those who “mean us harm and who plot to strike at our very way of life”, which perfectly captured the cabinet. Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, told me that the only meaningful security check Patel could run is one that takes seconds at international airports: scanning a passport and seeing if the owner is on a watch list. No one would have raised the smallest objection if she had done so. Instead, Conservative ministers used an evidence-free scare about an invented Russian plot to abandon the victims of war. British citizens who offered to open up their homes have found their own government is bent on blocking their generosity. Traumatised people strung out along the European rail system or still waiting in Ukraine must navigate Whitehall regulations on their phones. Inevitably, most cannot find a way through dozens of pages of forms and document upload demands, and abandon their plans to come to the UK, which suited the government just fine, until it realised to its evident astonishment that it had bet on the nastiness of Conservatives and lost. A significant number of Tory voters have not thanked the government for treating them as racists. It turns out they meant it when they said they welcomed genuine refugees and, as far as they could see, Ukrainians fleeing Putin’s bombs were just that. From Enoch Powell to Brexit, the popular complaint has been that liberal-minded governments have opened up the country to immigration without so much as a by your leave from the governed. As Sunder Katwala of the British Future thinktank says, whether it is with Afghans who served British forces or Ukrainian refugees, voters are now turning on this government for not being liberal enough. Patel and Johnson realise their mistake and are in the grotesque position of pretending that no one is as frustrated as they are at the cruelties of their own system. If they meant it, they would announce today that Britain will match the European Union’s generosity to Ukrainians. They won’t because they cannot escape the fear – or should that be the hope? – that when British people say they want to do good in the world, they are lying.

4/10/2022,"The Valencia region is well known for its citrus fruit, seafood and rice, but “gastronomy” has grown fast here in recent years. Compared with my girlfriend’s home town in France, though, a great meal isn’t madly expensive. A huge shellfish fideuà – a Valencian paella made with pasta instead of rice – costs €10.50 at Restaurante Yuso in the old city. More often, we’ll go for tapas on the terraces in the Benimaclet district, near the university. La Negri opened two years ago and does Valencian specialities such as ham croquetas and truffled eggs, but the cooking isn’t all orthodox: they also experiment with red-shrimp gyoza and hoisin-beef bao. Mid-morning, people stop for almuerzo, our version of brunch, dating from when workers needed a break from the fields. I usually have a pastry with a rum-spiked coffee we call cremaet. Music has an emotional hold over Valencians, and everyone can appreciate it as it’s affordable. On Sunday mornings new bands will play free live shows at bandstands in parks such as Viveros/Jardins del Real and at La Pérgola at the marina. And a lot of bars host jam sessions: on Monday nights La Vitti invites instructors from the Valencia campus of Boston’s Berklee College of Music on stage (the €5 entry includes a beer). Another of my favourite venues is Festinar, a cafe in El Cabanyal, an old fishermen’s district by the beach, known for colourful tiles on its buildings. Festinar puts on Thursday-night jazz concerts with pizza and beer: book on Instagram. Valencia is a great city for cycling, so hire a bike and visit Ruzafa, a barrio just south of the neoclassical bullring. You will probably recognise Ruzafa from photographs of the covered produce market, with its rainbow-coloured window louvres, though it’s better known for its small bistros and bars, and for the vintage shops on Carrer de Cadis. There’s a calmer vibe around here than in the centre, which can get chaotic, and it has become so cool since it started gentrifying 15 years ago. The cafes seem to compete for Instagrammers, and every corner has a terrace for after-work cocktails – I like Cafe Tula for its ginebra (gin) list. After floods practically destroyed Valencia in 1957, the city diverted the course of the Turia River, leaving the old riverbed that ran through the centre of the city empty and derelict. At one point the government wanted to turn it into a highway, but the community protested – it was amazing to see the power for change. In the 1980s a massive landscaping effort began, and now the entire city centre is united by this green belt. Keep your hire bike and follow a route through the gardens, which run for six miles. At their eastern end is the famous City of Arts and Sciences, a complex of ultra-modern concert halls and museums designed by local architect Santiago Calatrava. Valencians divide their nights into three parts: a post-work drink, then dinner, then serious drinking. It’s easy to dip into any of these, but I usually go out after work and stay out. We do have a late-night scene, though the clubs play mostly commercial European dance music and mediocre techno. The best venue by a mile is Barraca in Sueca, a small town 20 miles away in Albufera natural park. It’s reachable by bus, train or taxi, with beachy nightlife nearby before you head to the club – well worth the journey for a Berlin-style techno night. Hotel Marqués House (doubles from €125) is in a restored manor in a central location. The bar – designed by local ceramic maker Lladró – makes a powerful agua de Valéncia, the city cocktail, with gin, vodka, cava and fresh orange juice. Juan Suay moved to Valencia five years ago.

4/10/2022,"Acottage outside Floyd, Virginia, is a tranquil stage-set for Ellen Isaacs to wage one of the longest-running wars of the opioid epidemic: the battle to hold OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma, its owners and executives, to just account. It’s battle that Isaacs, a former mortgage fraud expert at Citigroup, has been fighting since she and her son Ryan became dependent on OxyContin, Purdue Pharma’s “non-addictive” painkiller that has played a central role in an epidemic that has cost 500,000 lives over two decades. Isaacs is one of just two individuals holding out against a controversial bankruptcy settlement that would effectively shield Purdue’s former owners, the Sackler family, from further litigation. “I’m a truth seeker on a fact-finding mission,” she says plainly from under her cowboy hat. But she’s also a grieving mother. Her son died of an overdose four years ago, aged 32, and she now travels with boxes of Narcan, the opioid overdose treatment that might have saved Ryan if it had been administered sooner. “Ryan didn’t choose to live his life this way,” she wrote in a recent legal submission to a New York court, describing the devastation caused by opioid addiction as a national mental health crisis. “The Sacklers poisoned my son’s mind … and used their marketing team and physicians to administer synthetic heroin to my son.” At the end of this month, that court – the second circuit appeals court in New York – will hear arguments over individual liability releases approved by a bankruptcy court charged with distributing Purdue Pharma’s assets. Those releases, another court found in December, weren’t authorized under the law and the plan was reversed. But under the terms of the now-vacated deal, the Sacker family would contribute $6bn over 18 years to an opioid settlement trust. It’s a situation that angers Isaacs, and thousands of others, who feel that a measure of corporate responsibility may have been assigned, but Purdue’s decision-maker will never be held to account. “I want my day in court,” Isaacs says in a small and direct voice. “Purdue and the Sacklers caused a genocide; they weaponized the medicine cabinets of the US.” If the ruling that vacated the bankruptcy settlement is overturned, and the deal is reinstated in bankruptcy court, the mom turned activist-advocate plans to take her case to the supreme court. If it’s upheld, then members of the Sackler family, facing legal exposure, would probably do the same. “I will turn the court on its head,” she warns. “This company has made billions of dollars – the blood money of our children. And I stand for everybody who has been harmed.” Isaacs’ campaign ranges far. She has written to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth, asking for British-born Dame Theresa Sackler to be stripped of her title. “I tried to pull at the Queen’s heart-strings but I don’t know if she got the letter,” she says. “The Sacklers’ property and prestige has taken them to where they are and it needs to stop.” The legal blizzard that trails the opioid epidemic, switching from federal to state, civil to criminal (lawyers have billed close to $1bn in legal fees in the Purdue case alone) has left many of the most affected families and communities again feeling marginalized. Isaacs, in the court submission, wrote that the Sacklers had “been the puppeteers running the NYSD bankruptcy court for nearly two and a half years”. “This needs to stop and the government needs to intervene. I’m sick of hearing about Purdue’s money. The money isn’t going to make a dent in the crisis that’s going on,” Isaacs says. “The Sacklers need to be indicted. No swanky prison, no TVs, no Bernie Madoff, Martha Stewart specials. Put an ankle monitor on them and put them out in the community to help clear up the mess.” On the issue of immunity, the Department of Justice is notionally on Isaacs’ side. In December, the attorney general, Merrick Garland, said the “bankruptcy court did not have the authority to deprive victims of the opioid crisis of their right to sue the Sackler family”. From licensing authorities to manufacturers to distributors to doctors to pharmacies, there’s no shortage of responsibility for the crisis. Many parties have already settled out of court, often for billions of dollars. But only Massachusetts has passed laws specifically directing opioid settlements toward addiction prevention and treatment. “The states are going to misappropriate the funds for payroll and administrative fees, and not going to go toward abating the opioid crisis,” Isaacs fears. “They proved that with asbestos and big tobacco. All they’re doing is bickering among each other.” Meanwhile, a flood of illicit fentanyl trafficked from Mexico and China is blamed for a majority of 105,000 overdose deaths recorded last year, a steep increase on the years that OxyContin was the main source of misery during the opioid epidemic. Isaacs was put on OxyContin repeatedly after a surgeries in the late 90s. Her son Ryan had a similar experience. Living in Florida, they found themselves at the center of the pill-mill distribution era of the early 2000s. For years, he did the “Florida Shuffle” – a term used to describe opportunistic schemes by unscrupulous treatments centers in Palm Beach county to continuously bill insurance companies for clients’ cycles of detox, discharge, relapse and re-admission. At the center of each story is addiction. Isaacs herself spent four months in a rehab in 2001. It wasn’t her first or last detox. She ended up managing it herself, at home, from 120mg of OxyContin prescribed by her doctor. “I knew that crazy things were going on because the doctors kept putting me on and I kept having to get myself off.” But her son went from OxyContin to Dilaudid to oxycodone from pill mills. When the pill mills were shut down, he switched to heroin. And back to OxyContin. And on to fentanyl. “Addiction destroys everything,” Isaacs says, noting the tangle and dysfunction of her own family. “People used to think ostracizing and isolating people, throwing them to the curb, was a solution. Let them fend for themselves. It isn’t. Love and inclusion is the answer.” It’s a message, perhaps, that’s beginning to get through. US health authorities, including the Biden administration, have put emphasis on MAT – medically assisted treatment – which involves long-term buprenorphine treatment rather than abstinence-based regimes. There are 20 buprenorphine prescribing doctors within a few miles of Isaac’s home. Ramshackle clinics are popping up as pill-mills once did. “They’re doling it out like they used to dole out the Oxy,” Isaacs says, “and it’s extremely abusable.” Isaacs’ background in mortgage fraud detection, applied to her experience in navigating the opioid issue, has led her to a conclusion: radical institutional re-organization. States that signed on to the settlement, she says, were not only ignoring the will of the people but double-dipping. “The whole system is fraudulent,” she says. “We need total justice reform – civil, bankruptcy, criminal, juvenile. But the government is up there on Capitol Hill playing games and watching all this happen. The only thing they’re capable of doing is approving national holidays.” One solution, she suggests, is for the government to declare a national emergency, take over abandoned shopping malls to make homes, or communes of recovery that would help to get addicts off the streets, as well as make fentanyl test strips and safe injection sites readily available.

4/10/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has triggered a long-term shift in the tectonic plates of history that even three months ago appeared extremely unlikely. We are only six weeks in but even now, it is clear this one event will have multiple consequences around the world for many years to come. Books on current affairs and recent history always run the risk of being overtaken by events. The revolutions in eastern Europe upended many papers and books on policy, which were still confidently assuming that the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic or Yugoslavia would still be functioning states well into the millennium. (Even the CIA, as late as spring 1988, was predicting that no great upheaval in eastern Europe was likely in the coming years.) Such developments have consigned many a tome to the charity bookshops prematurely. Occasionally, a book will buck this trend. Scholars and policymakers were quick to hail Francis Fukuyama’s essay The End of History, published in early 1989, and his subsequent book, as a work of prescient genius. It was only a few short years before various wars, terrorist incidents, emerging powers, financial collapses and more should have dispatched the book to the remainder bin of history, but in fact it continues to sell in significant numbers. Even rarer than this is a book whose significance is enhanced by unpredictable events. But this is unquestionably the case with Gideon Rachman’s latest work, The Age of the Strongman, which goes some distance in explaining the bigger picture behind all this. Rachman is chief foreign policy commentator at the Financial Times. As such, not only has he studied many of the strongmen in this book, he knows most of them as well. This is one of the main reasons why the book hasn’t lost any relevance despite being finished before the Russian invasion. But there are others. At the moment, the media in Europe and the US are understandably focusing on the fighting in Ukraine, the unspeakable acts of violence perpetrated by the Russian military, the attendant refugee crisis, the impact on European energy supplies and western sanctions on Russia. But the implications of Russia’s invasion go far beyond this. We are seeing the beginnings of remarkable strategic realignments in several parts of the world, including India and the Middle East. The rise in the price of a number of food staples – including wheat, sunflower oil and ingredients used in fertiliser – has already led many governments to hit the panic button. Egypt, with 100 million people, is scrambling to secure dwindling supplies, as are equally populous countries such as Bangladesh and Indonesia. The events in Ukraine have led to an acceleration of the threats to the Amazon, already close to the much feared “die back” tipping point. In the past month the price of soya has increased 10%, making the widespread illegal deforestation under Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, even more lucrative than before. Brazil is blaming the problems with the supply of fertiliser not on Russia but on western sanctions, which were imposed without Brasília being consulted. Political sub-dramas proliferate within the European Union, in the western Balkans, in the Horn of Africa and in the Caucasus. Thirty years after Fukuyama argued that liberal democracy was the pinnacle of a Hegelian historical process, global politics are being rent asunder by an almighty struggle between democracy and autocracy. If western democratic values are to survive this, something that is by no means guaranteed, then the west’s multiple constituencies need to understand what exactly led us to this point and where our responsibility lies. We know that Vladimir Putin ordered the troops into Ukraine, but how did we contribute to this so soon after the proclamation of the End of History? Rachman provides many answers by focusing on the growing popularity over the past decade of autocrats and their aspirants. They fall into roughly three groups. There are fully fledged dictators like Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. Then come democratically elected leaders who have gone a long way in demolishing institutional checks and balances, such as independent courts and media. These include Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and more recently, Viktor Orban, who last week recorded another crushing electoral victory in Hungary. And finally we have those like Donald Trump who have attempted, if not with complete success, to smash democratic norms both by undermining institutions and by resorting to insurrectionary tactics where necessary. Rachman anticipates some criticism for including Boris Johnson. He need not be shy. I, too, included Johnson in my podcast series, The Rise of the Iron Men, which dealt specifically with those strongmen who were elected democratically before setting about trying to destroy or undermine the very fundamentals that enabled their election in the first place. Different circumstances lead to the development of varied strategies. One of Johnson’s primary tools, for example, includes absurdist knockabout bluster, a seemingly intentional combination of various comedic traditions including possibly Monty Python and Norman Wisdom (no offence intended to either). The Age of the Strongman provides a useful list of characteristics that strongmen share whether democratically elected or not: “The creation of a cult of personality; contempt for the rule of law; the claim to represent the real people against the elites (otherwise known as populism); and a politics driven by fear and nationalism.” I would add a fifth characteristic: they all lie. They lie every day, about issues great and small, about matters personal and public. And even when they are caught lying red handed, they simply respond by countering with an even greater lie – a Ponzi scheme of untruths. Of course, Rachman also examines the long-term causes that have contributed to the rise of the strongmen: western hubris after its victory in the cold war; neoliberalism; a globalisation that has benefited the 1% and immiserated billions. But this book sensibly sets all this against the extraordinary characters who have exploited the insecurities and anxieties that have brought us here. The outcome of Russia’s war against Ukraine will go a long way in deciding whether western liberalism is running out of historical steam and the strongmen will succeed in extinguishing it altogether. The implications for the more fundamental problems we face, such as climate change, are incalculable. To begin working out what we do about this, you could do worse than by reading this pithy and forceful book.

4/10/2022,"The architect Sam Webb has never forgotten walking into the charred, smoke-blackened bathroom on the 11th floor of a tower block devastated by fire in July 2009. In the soot-covered bathtub were the smeared imprints of the feet and hands of two young children. Along with their mother and another mother and baby, they had sought refuge in the small room after the fire spread rapidly across combustible panels on the block. All five of them died. Webb was an expert witness in the inquest into the fire at Lakanal House in Camberwell, south London, and was determined lessons would be learned from the tragedy, which claimed six lives in total. He said in his evidence to the inquest that the tower block blaze had taken “the fire brigade by complete surprise in the way it went up and down the building”. Recommendations made in 2013 by the coroner Frances Kirkham after the fire at Lakanal House were still waiting to be implemented some four years later at the time of the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017, in which 72 people died. Over the past fortnight the Grenfell inquiry has heard evidence from a succession of ministers who have lined up for the first time to explain what went wrong. The evidence has laid bare a litany of miscommunication, poor governance and misguided policies in the government department responsible for fire safety. Eric Pickles, the secretary of state for communities and local government from 2010 to 2015, said in his evidence last week that even if he had accepted Kirkham’s March 2013 recommendations, he did not believe it would have made any difference. Lord Pickles said: “I think there was a kind of mindset that existed in parts of the department that just simply ignored what was happening, made a view about what we were and came to it.” The department’s previous statement to the inquiry has admitted a catalogue of errors, which “cumulatively created an environment in which such a tragedy was possible.” In his evidence last Wednesday and Thursday, Pickles seemed more defensive than apologetic for his department’s systemic failings, urging counsel to “use your time wisely” in the questioning because he had an “extremely busy day meeting people”. He later apologised to the inquiry if he had appeared discourteous. He wrongly said 96 people had died in the fire and referred to them as the “nameless” when they have all been identified. The evidence from Pickles and three other former ministers has provided some insight into the departmental inertia in the face of warnings of failings in fire safety regulations. Gavin Barwell, a former housing minister in the department who became Theresa May’s chief of staff when she was prime minister, said he was comforted by statistics that showed the number of people who had died in fires in homes in the UK had fallen from 865 in 1979 to 353 in 2008. He said: “I think, with the clear benefit of hindsight, I gained a completely false situation awareness.” Lord Barwell also offered another defence: that few people were demanding action following the recommendations. He said: “This wasn’t an issue that was being raised by the opposition. I wasn’t being asked about it by the media.” One MP, though, was certainly raising questions: the late Sir David Amess, chair of the all-party parliamentary fire safety and rescue group at the time, which was advised by a former chief fire officer, Ronnie King, and architect Webb. An investigation by trade magazine Inside Housing revealed that between 2014 and 2017 the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) wrote to ministers at least 21 times, calling for the recommendations after the Lakanal House fire to be implemented. The proposals included a fitting of sprinklers in tower blocks and a review of building regulations “with particular regard to the spread of fire over the external envelope of a building”. The group was repeatedly rebuffed. Stephen Williams, the minister responsible for building regulations at the time of the Lakanal House report, said in evidence to the Grenfell inquiry last week he did not believe he even read the coroner’s letter and recommendations. He admitted sending a letter that was effectively a “brush-off” to the proposed package of fire safety reforms being proposed by the APPG on advice from officials. He said he regretted that the letter had been sent. Williams was told by his officials in 2014 that a review of the key fire regulations in document called Approved Document B would be completed by 2016-17, but was told it required significant work and was not urgent. The review was not completed at the time of the Grenfell fire. Ministers also failed to act on other warnings, including a letter from Dany Cotton, then the commissioner of London fire brigade, in April 2017 when she wrote to Barwell, once again alerting ministers to what had happened at Lakanal House and warning of “mounting evidence of concern within residential buildings and, in particular, blocks of flats”. By this stage, time was running out. It was just two months before the Grenfell fire. Barwell said he did not think he had seen the letter because the general election had been called and he does not believe it was forwarded by his general office. Melanie Dawes, the department’s former permanent secretary, gave evidence last month in which she said she considered a government drive to cut regulation was also a factor in the delays to reform building regulations. A government initiative had been launched in 2011 to cut down the 21,000 statutory rules and regulations in force. Dawes said the strong focus on cutting red tape meant it was “very difficult to get anything changed”. Pickles said he did not know that a focus on red tape had hindered officials from tightening fire safety standards and considered building standard regulations were exempt, but could not cite where the details of the exemption was set out.",News/UK news,"Grenfell Tower inquiry exposes miscommunication, poor governance and misguided policies",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/10/grenfell-tower-inquiry-exposes-miscommunication-poor-governance-and-misguided-policies
4/10/2022,"“The revolution is here,” said an exuberant Chris Smalls on a cloudy morning via a Google Meet call last week. Clad in a black baseball cap and air pods, Smalls spoke with the Guardian less than a week after winning a historic victory over Amazon, the second largest US employer – and establishing the company’s first ever union. For more than two years, Smalls and his co-organizer Derrick Palmer led a campaign to form Amazon’s first union at a Staten Island warehouse. Hosting cookouts, bonfires and other small gatherings with Amazon employees, Smalls and Palmer signed up over 4,000 workers for the union vote, with staff voting to establish a union by a wide margin of more than 500 votes. While the quest to form a union at Amazon formally began in March 2020, when Smalls led a workplace walkout over pandemic working conditions, Smalls told the Guardian that problems with Amazon started earlier, with no resolution in sight. When staff complained of low pay, unsafe working conditions and short breaks, management at Amazon were complacent. “Amazon doesn’t really know their own workers,” said Smalls. “They think we’re all stupid, they think we’re kids,” he added, noting that Amazon would sometimes give workers small treats like lollipops or cupcakes rather than meaningfully addressing their complaints. Things came to a head when Smalls, an assistant manager at the time, staged a walkout over Amazon’s lack of personal protective equipment, social distancing guidelines and other pandemic protections. Amazon fired Smalls the same day as the protest, alleging that he had broken quarantine orders. Smalls asserts that he was fired in retaliation, and figures such as Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and New York attorney general Letitia James criticized his dismissal. Being fired motivated Smalls to begin campaigning for an official union at Amazon, a chance for workers to fight grueling conditions that remained unresolved. “Established unions had 28 years to unionize at Amazon and obviously that didn’t work,” said Smalls, adding that many established unions and supposed outside experts didn’t understand how Amazon operated – or what its employees endured. Traditional tactics of organizing didn’t work at Amazon, Smalls said. Rallying staff in secret was a failing project “because one worker will be here today, gone the next day”, said Smalls. “You need to be out front and outspoken with this company,” he added. Bringing in politicians or celebrities to rally union votes, strategies used during an unsuccessful union vote in Alabama, was also not a winning strategy, as many staff “don’t even know who these politicians are”, said Smalls. Instead, Smalls and Palmer reached out to their coworkers with more grassroots methods, setting up a gathering place at a bus stop workers used to commute home. There, they handed out food to their fellow employees – funded in part by GoFundMe donations – and discussed employee grievances. “We are Amazon workers. We have the experience. So it just worked for us,” said Smalls. Whereas Amazon quickly began hounding workers with anti-union messages, a move that Smalls said backfired as staff felt their independent vote was being targeted, Smalls and fellow co-organizers remained patient, waiting for workers to have their own moments of realization and sign up to vote. “Once they got out of the honeymoon phase, they would come right to the tent, sign on up,” said Smalls, adding, “This is a marathon, not a sprint.” Smalls and Palmer, a six-year veteran with Amazon who Smalls said had substantial influence at the company, also spread their union message via various social groups with demographics that Amazon management ignored. To expose Amazon’s hired union busters, Smalls and Palmer printed out signs with phrases like “Most Wanted” and “Catch a Union Buster,” publicizing the name, picture, salary, and location of where anti-union hires were from. Meanwhile, Amazon, which spent over $4m to stop Smalls’ efforts, escalated its own tactics. In addition to calling Smalls “not smart or articulate” and characterizing pro-union organizers as “thugs”, Amazon had Smalls and other co-organizers arrested for trespassing while they were dropping off food and union materials. Amazon management also tried to appeal to white workers by calling union organizing nothing but Black Lives Matter protests, according to Smalls. Smalls also said that Amazon worked with other companies, including the warehouse’s land owner and the New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), to block their efforts: putting up scaffolding to stop organizers from building a tent, rerouting the bus stop so workers couldn’t see Smalls’ setup, and even changing the bathroom code. “Why are you working with Amazon to union bust?” Smalls said of Amazon’s anti-union collaborators. Despite Amazon’s efforts, the resolve of Smalls and others paid off. In a win that shocked labor organizers and observers, Amazon workers at the warehouse voted 2,654 to 2,131 to establish a union for the very first time. “The workers that I organize with are like my family now,” Smalls said. “To bring this victory to them is the best feeling in the world, next to my kids’ birth.” Smalls and other co-organizers have begun the process of negotiating a contract, demanding that Amazon not hire or fire any employees as talks continue. With a second union vote at a separate warehouse set for 25 April, Smalls is ready to see another victory. “I know what I sacrificed,” said Smalls. “I know what they sacrificed to get there.”",News/US news,"‘A marathon, not a sprint’: how Chris Smalls defied Amazon to form a union",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/10/chris-smalls-amazon-union-staten-island
4/10/2022,"No one in the column of tourists making their way to York Minster along the city wall even glances at Northern House. The slab of beige 1960s architecture is not a building that provokes much passion. But the layers of mud beneath it are a different matter. A plan to demolish Northern House to unearth the centuries of history below and create a new Roman-themed visitor centre, hotel and apartments has caused a row among archaeologists. York Archaeology Trust (YAT) has teamed up with a local developer, North Star, to propose the creation of an enormous underground museum filled with the Roman artefacts they are confident will be found below Northern House. The “Roman quarter” development – to be called Eboracum, the name of the Roman precursor to York – would be funded by Northern House’s replacement: a 10-storey building with an 88-room hotel, 153 apartments and office space. Yet the plan has opponents ranged against it from Historic England, which described it as “confused and contradictory”, to the Council for British Archaeology. “We’ve been quite shocked by the brutal approach taken with this particular development,” said Neil Redfern, the executive director of the CBA, which represents more than 600 institutions. Normally archaeologists are brought on board after a development is proposed, he said, and digs are no bigger than necessary. “What this proposal is doing is saying, no, we would like a visitor centre and to get that visitor centre we want to dig a very, very big hole to find the material that we might then put in that visitor centre. And to afford that, we’re going to need an extremely large building on top.” “The present Northern House is certainly no beauty,” said Johnny Hayes, a former independent York city councillor and veteran of several town planning campaigns. “But it was built before conservation areas were in place and two wrongs do not make a right. If this is built I think it will become one of York’s most hated buildings.” There are many unanswered questions, Redfern said. Only a third of the site would be excavated, so what happens to the rest? The YAT would have no more than two years, and digging down six metres to Roman levels means going through Viking and Anglian deposits – what happens if they make an extraordinary find? What happens to the visitor centre plan if they find nothing? What if the developer goes bust, or sells on the planning permission? Sheltering from April hailstones at the rear of Northern House, David Jennings, YAT’s chief executive, has answers to some of these questions. Techniques have improved since the 1980s, and archaeology is all about dealing with the unexpected, he says, confident that the two-year deadline would not compromise the dig. The reason they would excavate only a third of the land is because Northern House was built partly on an old petrol station, which had fuel tanks dug deep into the ground, so a lot of material was lost long ago. “This really is a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” Jennings said. “It’s 30 years since we’ve seen a dig of this scale.” The Aviva building next door, built in the 1990s, was the last large-scale excavation. It revealed that there was a Roman civilian camp on the southern bank of the River Ouse, with a road roughly below Tanner Row leading to a bridge to a legionaries’ camp. “We’re going to be able to start to explain the connections around the old Roman road, the economy of the city, the meats they ate. In the previous digs we found a dormouse, and bits of Roman tents in the name of a centurion who is referred to at Hadrian’s Wall, Sollius Julianus,” Jennings says. Only this area, with its hodge-podge of architectural styles created before conservation areas were invented, could bear such a development, Jennings said. Elsewhere in York the buildings are smaller, so developers are less likely to need to pay for archaeological investigations. “This is one of the few places that it can be done, because of the location, the scale, and the relationship between us and a local development community,” Jennings said. “It comes down to whether the emphasis is placed on conservation or on new discovery.” York is the home of British archaeology – the CBA’s headquarters are five minutes’ walk from Northern House. The city is a site of international significance partly because so much history happened nearby, from Constantine’s proclamation as emperor in 306 to the battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066, but also because the city’s waterlogged earth has preserved so much material. Eboracum would be twice the size of the hugely successful Jorvik Viking Centre, the result of a similar archaeological dig from 1976 to 1981, also conducted by YAT – before York’s Coppergate shopping centre was built. The Coppergate dig was successful because the lack of oxygen in the water allowed the preservation of leather shoes, the timber from two-storey Viking houses, and even the pungent lime-sealed cesspits whose aromas can still be experienced at the Jorvik centre. Britain’s Covid-battered tourism industry is back to pre-pandemic levels in York, and earlier this month saw the opening of a new City Walls centre and the reopening of Clifford’s Tower, the motte and bailey castle built by William the Conqueror during his genocidal northern campaign. “The beauty of York is that the archaeology is both below and above ground, because the above-ground expression of buildings, street patterns and burgage plots is a reflection of what’s below the ground,” Redfern said. “York’s most valuable attribute is its human scale which emanates from the very first people who went there and started to develop this place. “This building just completely cuts across that. “We know York Archaeological Trust well,” Redfern added. “They are a good archaeological unit. I just don’t think they’ve chosen the right option on this one.”",News/Science,York divided over plan for new ‘Roman quarter’ (hotel and 153 flats included),https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/10/york-divided-over-plan-for-new-roman-quarter-hotel-and-153-flats-included
4/10/2022,"Russia’s missile attack on Kramatorsk railway station is an act of unforgivable barbarism. How many more such atrocities must occur before western leaders admit their Ukraine strategy is failing? How many more children must die before Nato stops making excuses for inaction? How much longer before Joe Biden, Boris Johnson, Olaf Scholz and the rest face up to what seems an inescapable choice: either intervene directly – or lose? These are uncomfortable, frightening questions. But with every missile that explodes, with every illegal cluster bomb and artillery shell, with every war crime committed, they become harder to duck. Sanctions on Russia and arms for Ukraine are celebrated by western governments as an unprecedented, unifying success. They tell each other what a good job they’re doing. But it’s not working. Vladimir Putin has been branded a war criminal and pariah. His funds have been frozen, his cronies penalised. Moscow’s strategic objectives have not been met, his discredited army is a vicious rabble, his war aims are in ruins, just like Mariupol and Kharkiv. His country faces incalculable long-term economic and reputational damage. But Putin does not care. He does not stop. Nor is there any sign he will. Good-faith attempts to talk sense to him have failed, used by the Kremlin to obfuscate and delay. Hopes that internal opposition may unseat him remain mere hopes. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s brave, terrified citizens await the next dreadful blow while their president pleads for more arms, more help, more anything. Russian “monsters” were responsible for the carnage at Kramatorsk, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. It was part of a deliberate strategy to kill civilians and create a lifeless wasteland. “They have not abandoned their methods. Lacking the strength and courage to fight us on the battlefield, they are cynically destroying the civilian population... This is an evil that has no limits. And if it is not punished, it will never stop,” Zelenskiy said. He’s right. Of course he’s right. Anyone watching television or reading uncensored newspapers and social media knows he’s right. And so, too, do all 30 Nato powers. Yet even as they condemn Kramatorsk, Bucha and other obscenities, millions more unprotected Ukrainians are told to expect an even greater enormity – an all-out offensive in eastern Ukraine by reinforced Russia troops. This, as the west watches, is what Ukraine’s democracy has been reduced to by Putin. The people’s choice: run for your life or face being raped, tortured and killed. Such barbarity cannot stand. Continued, shaming, ineffectual western shouting from the sidelines is unacceptable. The sooner Biden and the rest stop wringing their hands and start calling the shots the better. Though welcome, Boris Johnson’s show of solidarity in Kyiv yesterday will not change calculations in Moscow. Putin rules by fear. So frighten him back. He does not want a fight with the west, let alone a third world war – Nato’s excuse of last resort for refusing to confront him. He knows he’d lose. It scares him. So here are some of the hard choices western leaders must urgently consider. First, direct intervention to create a safe haven in western Ukraine, where displaced people may congregate instead of fleeing abroad. Inform Moscow in advance of its location and boundaries. Be clear it will be protected by Nato air power and ground forces invited in by Kyiv. Second, declare the unoccupied city of Odesa off-limits. Send naval forces into international waters in the Black Sea and warn Russia to cease coastal bombardments or face serious, unspecified consequences. Third, tell Putin that if his artillery and missile units fire on civilians again, as in Kramatorsk, they will be deemed legitimate Nato military targets. Fourth: supply fighter planes and tanks to Kyiv. Fifth: block all Russian fossil fuel exports. These are radical choices. The risks are obvious. But the only alternative is endless slaughter.

4/10/2022,"Britain’s heritage railways are running out of steam. Or, to be more precise, coal. Vintage rail operators across the country have warned that their stocks are now dangerously low and the prospects of replacing them in the near future look bleak. Many of the UK’s heritage rail companies say they are already having to cut services just as they prepare for the Easter break, when their main operating seasons begin. “It is a very serious problem,” said Paul Lewin, of Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland Railways. “UK coal for steam trains has now gone and our next supply source was to be Russia, which is now off the table for totally understandable reasons. We are in a very tricky position.” This view was shared by Steve Oates, chief executive of the Heritage Railway Association. “The situation is very serious,” he said. “Our coal stocks are running out fast and the search is on to find alternative sources from overseas. However, there is no obvious source for the right quality of coal that we require and prices are fluctuating all over the place. So yes, we are having severe difficulties.” The UK has more than 150 heritage rail companies covering 560 miles of track that runs between 460 stations. These vintage rail operators range from the hugely successful Jacobite steam trains that operate on Network Rail track from Fort William and Mallaig in Scotland to tiny, privately owned narrow-gauge lines that are sometimes only a mile or two in length. Many used to serve now defunct mines or linked isolated towns in spectacularly remote regions and have become major tourist attractions. “These lines play a big role in UK tourism today so any threat to them is a real worry,” added Chris Austin, secretary of the all-party parliamentary group on heritage railways. “They are worth about half a billion pounds a year to the national economy – mainly through the visitors they attract to a region. “Millions of tourists take trips on these lines every year. In addition the bigger heritage railways provide both employment and apprenticeship schemes.” An example of the value of heritage lines to a region is provided by Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland Railways, whose steam trains – which run from Porthmadog to Blaenau Ffestiniog and from Caernarfon to Porthmadog – attract around 200,000 visitors a year, generating an estimated £25m for the local economy. The problem is that steam trains consume coal, an energy source now vilified for being a major source of greenhouse gases. In its attempts to reach net zero emissions, Britain has been closing down its coal mines. Ffos-y-fran, near Merthyr Tydfil, was the last to supply heritage rail lines with lumped coal but has now halted its supply before its total closure later this year. “That has left us struggling,” Lewin told the Observer. “We badly need to find new coal sources.” This point was echoed by James Shuttleworth of West Coast Railways, the company that runs Jacobite steam trains and provided the engines and carriages for the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter films. “You need coal that burns with a high calorific value for steam trains like ours and UK mines provided that,” he said. “It was absurd to close every British mine at a time when our steel and cement industries also still need coal and to rely, instead, on imports. We are paying the price for that decision today.” Alternative smokeless fuels have been developed from mixes of anthracite, coal dust and molasses – the latter acting as a binding agent – and several narrow-gauge rail companies have recently launched trials of the substance. Initial results have been promising, although tests still have to undertaken to asses the impact such fuels have on vulnerable parts of locomotives, such as their fireboxes and boiler tubes. In addition, it is unlikely these fuels will provide enough heat and energy to power steam trains that run on the country’s main lines, such as the Jacobite steam trains. One short-term solution will be for rail lines to operate fewer but longer trains and to cut out days of operation when trains cannot be filled. Increased reliance on the pre-booking of tickets will also occur. In the meantime, searches for alternative sources of coal are being made with Australia and Colombia being suggested as possible candidates. “Heritage railways are worth protecting because they are popular,” added Austin. “They are relaxing to travel on and the journeys provide educational experiences. For good measure they produce relatively little carbon dioxide compared with the emissions produced by an average holiday jet flight. “They are also especially important to the nation because railways were Britain’s gift to the world. They were invented and developed here and exported all over the globe. They changed the world and are linked tightly to our history.”",Lifestyle/Travel,End of the line?

4/10/2022,"Dog Point Vineyard Pinot Noir, Marlborough, New Zealand 2019 (from £26, thewinesociety.com; nzhouseofwine.co.uk; cambridgewine.com; woodwinters.com) For most of us in the UK, Easter Sunday lunch is like a much more relaxed version of Christmas dinner. Even if many meat-eaters will have roast lamb on the menu, there is much less of a feeling of having to serve specific things, and no fear of letting people down if you’ve forgotten some key arcane element (sprouts, cranberries, bread sauce) that you wouldn’t contemplate at any other time of the year and that you might not even particularly like. There’s also less of a sense of being compelled to excess: the Easter feast is a single meal, albeit one in which we might want to splash out a little more than we would on any other given Sunday. One very smart red candidate for my Easter table, a bottle that would go very well with a classic roast leg of lamb with rosemary and garlic, is the perfectly poised mix of prettiness, succulence, depth and slinkiness of Dog Point’s pinot noir. Morrisons The Best Cahors Malbec, Cahors, France 2020 (£8, Morrisons) Other Easter roast lamb choices rather depend on the way you’re going to prepare the meat. For a more Levantine style, in which fragrant spices – cumin, coriander, sumac, cardamom – and the sweet stickiness of pomegranate molasses might play a part, I find that the robust and spicy southern French-inspired red blends of Lebanon are unsurprisingly well matched: something like Domaine des Tourelles Red, Bekaa Valley, Lebanon 2019 (from £12.95, thewinesociety.com; slurp.co.uk; laithwaites.co.uk). For more straightforward recipes where the lamb is roasted to tenderness with little more than plentiful salt and pepper, then my go-to choices are either a mellow rioja with a bit of age and soft vanilla oakiness (CVNE Rioja Reserva 2017 – £13.50, ocado.com, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Whole Foods – is a textbook example), or a more brightly fruit-driven but still robust malbec, such as the gloriously vivid, vibrant Argentine Domaine Bousquet Finca Lalande Malbec, Mendoza 2021 (£10.95, Waitrose) or the great-value plummy Morrisons offering from Cahors in southwest France. Gabo do Xil Godello, Valdeorras, Galicia, Spain 2020 (from £12.95, thewinesociety.com; bbr.com) Fish is of course as much a part of Easter for many of us as lamb, not least on Good Friday. And although the lemony verve and mineral depths and energy of a great Greek Assyrtiko from the island of Santorini, such as Vassalitis Assyrtiko 2020 (£34, hedonism.co.uk) is a rare white that would in fact make a perfectly natural partner with braised or lemon-marinated lamb, it really comes into its own with the fruits of the sea. So too the similarly preserved lemon-scented dry whites made from the godello variety in Galicia in northwest Spain, with Gabo do Xil, made by the inordinately talented and influential multi-regional winemaker Telmo Rodriguez, being a particularly pristine, mouthwatering example. No less scintillating and evocative, with its notes of tarragon, dill and citrus, and ready to be served with white fish cooked with the same, is Nicosia Etna Bianco Lenza di Munti Sicily (£11.75, Booths), which is also very good value for a dry white from this trendy volcanic source.

4/10/2022,"Democrats need to make more noise when taking on Republicans, a US senator said, after angry remarks on the Senate floor in which he denounced the Missouri senator Josh Hawley for delaying Pentagon appointments and voting against aid to Ukraine, among other flashpoints. “Democrats need to make more noise,” Brian Schatz, from Hawaii, told the Washington Post. “We have to scream from the rooftops, because this is a battle for the free world now.” Schatz made waves with his Senate remarks on Thursday. His immediate subject was Hawley’s decision to place holds on Biden nominees including one for a senior Pentagon position. “He is damaging the Department of Defense,” Schatz said. “We have senior DoD leaders, we have the armed services committee coming to us and saying, ‘I don’t know what to tell him. I don’t know how to satisfy him, but he is blocking the staffing of the senior leadership at the Department of Defense’”. Referring to a famous picture of Hawley at the Capitol on the day of the 6 January 2021 attack, which the senator has used for fundraising efforts, Schatz said: “This comes from a guy who raised his fist in solidarity with the insurrectionists”. Then he returned to his theme. “This comes from a guy who before the Russian invasion suggested that maybe it would be wise for [Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy] to make a few concessions about Ukraine and their willingness to join Nato. “This comes from a guy who just about a month ago voted against Ukraine aid. He’s [now] saying it’s going too slow. He voted no. He voted no on Ukraine aid. And now he has the gall to say it’s going too slow.” Hawley has said he will lift his holds if the secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, resigns over the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Calling that “the final insult”, Schatz said: “That’s not a serious request. People used to come to me during the Trump administration all the time. ‘Do you think Trump should resign? Do you think [former secretary of state Rex] Tillerson should resign?’ That’s stupid. “Of course I think all the people I disagree with should quit their jobs and be replaced with people I love. Of course I think they should all resign. That’s not how this world works. That is not a reasonable request from a United States senator, that until the secretary of defense quits his job, I’m going to block all of his nominees. That’s preposterous.” In February, Hawley tied his holds – which can be overcome, if slowly, via Senate procedure – to Biden’s alleged failure to stop the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “If you think that Vladimir Putin and the other dictators around this world weren’t emboldened by this administration’s weakness,” he said, “by their utter failure in Afghanistan, then you’ve got another thing coming.” In his remarks, Schatz returned to Ukraine, pointing out that Hawley was among Republicans who in Trump’s first impeachment voted to acquit him for withholding military aid to Kyiv in an attempt to extract political dirt on the Bidens. “So spare me the new solidarity with the Ukrainians and with the free world because this man’s record is exactly the opposite,” Schatz said. The senator was speaking in a midterm elections year, seven months out from polling day and with Republicans favoured to retake the House and maybe the Senate. Speaking to the Post, he said he wanted voters to notice his attack on Hawley. “The central selling proposition for a lot of moderate voters was that they could put Biden in place and then stop worrying about politics,” Schatz said, adding that despite this, noise from “the Maga movement continues to grow”. “Voters who pay a normal amount of attention to our politics take their cues from elected officials as to how outrageous something is,” Schatz said. “If we don’t seem particularly perturbed”, he added, situations like Hawley’s obstruction may come to seem like “no big deal”.",News/US news,Senator urges Democrats to ‘scream from the rooftops’ against Republicans,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/10/republicans-democrats-us-senator-brian-schatz
