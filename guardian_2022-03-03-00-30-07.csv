3/3/2022,"The fitness-tracking device maker Fitbit is recalling 1.7m of its Ionic smartwatches after reports of the battery overheating and burning some users. The company, which was acquired by Google in 2021, had sold about 1m of the model in the US and nearly 700,000 internationally. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission announced the recall, warning that the watch’s lithium-ion battery can overheat, causing a “burn hazard”. The watch was recalled after Fitbit received 174 reports of its battery overheating, including cases of 118 people being burned. Many users wear the devices in bed to monitor them while sleeping. Two of the people injured by the watch had third-degree burns, while four others reported less severe second-degree burns. The commission told Ionic owners to stop using the recalled device immediately and contact Fitbit for pre-paid packaging to return the device and receive a refund. Fitbit will also provide any consumers who return their Ionic watch with a code for a discount on certain new devices. The Ionic smartwatch, which features a 3.5cm colour LCD screen and a polyurethane band available in several colours, tracks the wearer’s activity, heart rate and sleep. The brand name Fitbit is printed on the front of the Taiwan-manufactured watch, which was originally sold for between $200 (£150) and $330. The company said the watch was manufactured between 2017 and 2020, and is no longer sold through its website, fitbit.com or authorised retailers. However, Fitbit add that it did “not control third-party or aftermarket sellers”. The company was bought by Google for $2.1bn in January 2021 after regulatory scrutiny in the US and the EU over concerns about customers’ health and fitness data and whether it could be used for advertising purposes. As part of the deal, Google agreed it would not use Fitbit for ads for at least a decade. The Ionic smartwatch is the not the first product Fitbit, which was founded in San Francisco in 2007, has recalled. In 2014 it voluntarily recalled its Force device after some customers developed an allergic reaction. Fitbit said independent test results showed this was likely to be allergic contact dermatitis as a reaction to nickel in the device’s surgical-grade stainless steel.",News/Technology,Fitbit recalls 1.7m Ionic smartwatches because of ‘burn hazard’,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/02/fitbit-recalls-17m-ionic-smartwatches-due-to-burn-hazard
3/3/2022,"It was the second day of the war. I was really nervous – we were hearing explosions. I was praying to meet my son. I started to clean everything in my house, preparing for the baby, and even when I started to feel the pain, I couldn’t believe I’d be giving birth during war. Me and my husband were afraid to drive to the hospital because of the explosions. First we had to spend about 30 minutes in a queue to get gas. Then we were riding through Kyiv and it was empty – I’d never seen such an empty city. We heard the sound of sirens. It was scary, like a movie, but I was trying to stay positive. When we arrived, all the lights were turned off because hospital staff were afraid about being bombed. My doctor met us and showed us to a very comfortable and colourful room. But two hours later we heard sirens. It was very loud. It was unreal to look through the window and see all the beautiful Gothic architecture and hear the sirens. While I was pregnant I had taken yoga classes, prepared for gentle birth-giving, took courses. It wasn’t like this. The doctor said we needed to go to the bomb shelter. There was panic as people were rushing. I couldn’t even put my trousers on because it was too painful. When we entered the shelter we were shocked. It was built in Soviet times and wasn’t maintained, it was crumbling and very wet and cold. For us there was a small room without any doors, only a shower curtain that separated us from the main room with 50 people in it. There was no medical technology, just a gynaecological chair. I was trying to not even look over there and hoping to go back to the hospital soon. Then my waters broke. My doctor looked at me and said: “OK, we will do it here, it’s too dangerous to wait.” At that moment I wasn’t afraid. I trusted my doctor – the only thing on my mind was holding my son and ending the pain. I was so happy when I saw my son, Fedor. With his black hair he looked like a small copy of my husband, who cut the cord. When I held Fedor he was very warm. I just felt, wow, love and pure happiness and all these mystical feelings. As I held him in the bunker, I said to him: “You’re lucky, you’re unique, you’re born in Ukraine, you’re a new Ukrainian.” Every morning now I wake up a bit earlier just to look at him sleep, he looks like a small angel. I also look out the window to see if the buildings have stayed in their places or if they’ve been ruined. I hope my son will experience this war only from stories – that he will never, never feel what it’s like in real life. I don’t want him to know real war. Despite the war, Fedor has brought so much love, happiness and kindness into our home. We take care of him, and it makes us happy. I’m hoping and praying for peace – he’s a new Ukrainian, he should grow up in a new Ukraine.

3/3/2022,"I’ve always loved leopards. They’re such elusive, special animals. When I was growing up, black leopards were on my radar. They’re ubiquitous in culture, from The Jungle Book to superheroes – and I thought the black panther was the coolest animal of all. But they’re incredibly rare in the wild, especially in Africa, where I spend most of my time. Photographing them was a dream but not one I thought would ever happen. A black panther is essentially any melanistic big cat, melanism being a condition in which there’s an excess of dark pigment. The main cats that tend to exhibit this are leopards in Africa and Asia, and jaguars in South America. So a black panther in Africa is a black leopard. They’re an animal you hear about, or maybe a friend of a friend once saw one zipping across a road, but photos are so rare. I had never seen a good one. In 2018, I heard that a black leopard had been seen in Laikipia in Kenya. I knew this was a once in a lifetime opportunity. I got in touch with the landowner, went out for a recce and set up camera traps. At the beginning, I didn’t know how shy the animal would be so I started off using infrared cameras, the least intrusive way to photograph very shy species. On that first day, I had no results. I decided to leave the traps for three or four days before checking again – I was reluctant to go back for fear of disappointment. When I finally did, I checked four of my five traps without finding any leopard photos. Then I opened up the last one and started flicking through the images. It had captured a variety of species, including a hyena, a mongoose and a genet. I almost went straight past this picture because, on the small screen, almost everything in the centre of the frame was black. But those two bright eyes in the middle made me pause. It took a while for the significance to sink in. It was an incredible moment: such a rare creature photographed in the black of night. I took the memory card out and, keeping it as safe as a priceless diamond, rushed back to get it on the computer. Only on the big screen could I check the focus and see if it had really worked. I had no idea how the world would respond, but I knew it was something special. To have captured this almost invisible creature in the night makes the photo really stand out: all you see are the eyes shining back at you. For me, that is the essence of this creature. In that first year, I encountered him face-to-face five times. At night, he was like a ghost. You couldn’t see him by torchlight. The image works really well with the black and white from the infrared camera, the grass framing the animal. I spent a year going back and forth to Kenya, setting up traps. I started off with them widely spaced, but then honed in on key areas. I’ve continued to have traps running, keeping tabs on the black leopard and getting new images. The project has been going on for over three years now. With my photography, I try to show people things they’re not so used to seeing, whether that’s rare creatures like the black leopard, or more commonly photographed ones such as lions, but from a different perspective or at night. There’s no point repeating what’s been done. Photographing at night is an untapped frontier in wildlife photography, with so many nocturnal species or creative techniques you can use. My photos are about trying to convey the reverence I feel towards nature, and making people feel the awe and wonder I do when I’m encountering these creatures. If I can inspire people to care more about animals and the places where they live, hopefully it will encourage people to want to protect them.

3/3/2022,"Ukrainian refugees will have the right to live and work in the European Union for up to three years, under an emergency plan detailed on Wednesday in response to what is becoming Europe’s biggest refugee crisis this century. Nearly 836,000 people have fled Ukraine since Russia launched its brutal attack less than a week ago, according to the UN refugee agency, which has warned that 4 million could leave the country in the coming weeks and months. More than half (454,000) have fled to Poland, while 116,000 have gone to Hungary, 67,000 to Slovakia, 38,000 to Romania and 65,000 to non-EU Moldova, Europe’s poorest country. The EU plan, which is expected to be approved by the bloc’s 27 member states on Thursday, would grant Ukrainian nationals and permanent residents the right to live, work, access healthcare, housing and education immediately for up to one year, without the requirement to go through lengthy asylum procedures. If the conflict continues, or refugees cannot return safely, that status could be extended for a further two years. Ukrainian citizens already have 90-day visa free access to the EU, but this unprecedented change in EU law secures their status after that period expires. “Europe stands by those in need of protection,” the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in a statement that detailed the plans. “All those fleeing Putin’s bombs are welcome in Europe. We will provide protection to those seeking shelter and we will help those looking for a safe way home.” The proposal is based on a 2001 law drawn up in the aftermath of the Balkan wars, which has never been used. By waiving the requirement to claim asylum for Ukrainian nationals and permanent residents, the EU hopes to avoid overwhelming EU asylum systems. The EU will be looking to squeeze money from its existing asylum budget, but observers said the measures would need a hefty increase in funds. “This is billions and will require more EU funds as we are talking about an EU decision about EU borders,” said Jacob Kirkegaard of the German Marshall Fund, who also described the plan as a necessary move. Meanwhile, authorities in Brussels called on border guards on both sides of the Ukraine-EU frontier to ensure everyone is allowed into the EU, regardless of nationality or ethnicity. Concerns grew after widespread reports from African nationals attempting to flee the war that they were being turned back, either by Ukrainian or Polish border guards. A senior EU official rejected the “unfair” suggestion that Brussels was turning a blind eye to these reports, noting that the EU commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson, was in Poland on Wednesday to assess the situation. “What is very, very clearly the position of this commission and the position of the European Union … is that absolutely everyone regardless of nationality, of race, religion should be allowed into the European Union. They are fleeing war from Ukraine. We will be a safe haven.” People without Ukrainian citizenship or the right to permanent residence – a category that could cover many international students – will not gain the right to stay in the EU, but will be helped to return to their country of origin. The details of the EU asylum plan emerged after the British government agreed to relax immigration rules for Ukrainians, following widespread criticism its policy was not generous enough. Boris Johnson promised on Tuesday the UK would take in “considerable numbers” of Ukrainians, which his spokesperson later said would be about 200,000 people. Officials in Brussels expect even greater numbers of refugees from Ukraine than in 2015-16 when more than 1 million Syrians and people from other countries fled war and violence in the Middle East. At that time, the commission considered triggering the EU’s temporary protection directive, now being deployed for the first time over Ukraine, but decided against, as the situations were “very different” said the senior official. In 2015-16 about 40% of people arriving in the EU were Syrians, the official said, adding that the temporary protection law was “designed for a one-nationality situation” and “wouldn’t have solved the issues being faced at the time”.",News/World news,Ukraine refugees given right to live in EU for three years in new plan,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/ukraine-refugees-right-to-live-in-eu-plan
3/3/2022,"Airbus has joined Boeing in halting the supply of aircraft parts and services to Russian airlines, squeezing its aviation industry in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. The European aerospace firm said on Wednesday it was suspending support and delivery of spare parts, in line with international sanctions. Boeing stopped work with Russian airlines on Tuesday night after President Biden announced further sanctions on Moscow, including following Britain and the EU in banning Russian planes from its airspace. The Seattle-based manufacturer said: “We have suspended major operations in Moscow and temporarily closed our office in Kyiv. “We are also suspending parts, maintenance and technical support services for Russian airlines. As the conflict continues, our teams are focused on ensuring the safety of our teammates in the region.” Both manufacturers were unwilling to predict how it would affect Russian aviation in the short and medium term. About two-thirds of the total Russian fleet are either Boeing- or Airbus-made – 332 Boeing and 304 Airbus aircraft – and while maintenance and repair of all aircraft in service is routine and ongoing, the impact is unlikely to be immediate unless critical parts fail. Western leasing firms will also attempt to repossess jets operated by Russian carriers, with 515 planes leased from foreign companies, according to data from Cirium. Analysts said leased planes on the ground in Russia could be cannibalised to keep others flying. Peter Walter, of industry consultant IBA, told Reuters: “Because parts are limited, we will expect to see aircraft that are on the ground in Russia being robbed in order to keep the remainder of the fleet operational.” Sanctions will block the delivery of 37 new planes to Russian airlines this year, comprised mostly of Boeing’s re-licensed 737Max model, with 25 due to go to Utair. A further 25 planes are on order, according to IBA, including 13 of Airbus’s widebody A350 model set for Aeroflot. Airbus was on Wednesday deciding whether it could continue to keep open its Moscow engineering centre, where some work has been suspended temporarily, to keep providing services to Russian customers. The centre, known as ECAR, was set up as a joint-venture with Russian firms and investors in 2003 and employs 200 Russian engineers. The German maintenance group Lufthansa Technik also said it had stopped serving Russian customers. The developments will leave Russian aviation increasingly isolated. Its aviation industry is significant, accounting for about 6% of flights worldwide last year during the pandemic, although almost nine in 10 Aeroflot flights were internal. Firms in other sectors, meanwhile, have continued to announce their withdrawal from Russian ventures. The energy giant Texas ExxonMobil said in a statement that it would not invest in new developments in Russia because of the attack on Ukraine. ExxonMobil also said it would start taking steps to exit the Sakhalin-1 project, the vast oil and gas fields it operates for an international consortium on the island on the far north-east of Russia. It follows competitors in stopping joint operations with Russia, with Shell severing ties with Gazprom, and BP offloading its stake in Rosneft.

3/3/2022,"A juror in Ghislaine Maxwell’s criminal trial who apparently did not disclose childhood sexual abuse during jury selection will invoke his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination at an 8 March hearing. This juror, who is named Scotty David, was on 24 February ordered to appear in court for questioning about his answers on a screening questionnaire for then-prospective jurors. David’s completed questionnaire, which was made public last week, shows that he marked the “no” box in response to the question that asked: “Have you or a friend ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” The fact that David apparently marked “no” has spurred extensive controversy as he has claimed in post-trial interviews that he was victimized in his youth. The British former socialite Maxwell was convicted on 29 December on sex trafficking and other related charges for facilitating financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor girls, some just 14 years old. Epstein, a convicted sex offender whose associates once included rich and powerful figures such as Prince Andrew, was apprehended in July 2019 for sex trafficking of minor teens. Epstein killed himself around one month later while jailed in Manhattan awaiting trial. The controversy surrounding David took off after Maxwell’s trial. David claimed in media interviews that he endured sexual abused in childhood. David said that he told other jurors about this abuse – enabling them to understand facts from a victim’s perspective. When those reports emerged, prosecutors asked judge Alison Nathan to conduct an inquiry into his comments. Maxwell’s legal team made that request shortly thereafter. Nathan agreed to do so, writing in her recent decision: “Following trial, Juror 50 made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his own experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury selection.” She said: “Juror 50’s post-trial statements are ‘clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety’ – namely, a false statement during jury selection – has occurred. In a letter to Nathan filed Wednesday morning, David’s lawyer, Todd Spodek, said: “I write to inform the court that Juror 50 will invoke his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination at the hearing.” Prosecutors responded shortly thereafter, saying in a letter that they would push for David’s testimony. “The government writes to notify the court that it is in the process of seeking internal approval to seek an order … compelling Juror 50’s testimony at the hearing,” they said. “The government will, subject to internal approval, submit a proposed order to the court in advance of the hearing.”",News/US news,Ghislaine Maxwell trial juror to plead fifth amendment at hearing,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/02/ghislaine-maxwell-juror-fifth-amendment-hearing
3/3/2022,"The Swedish telecoms group Ericsson broke a formal agreement with US prosecutors by withholding evidence about its involvement in corruption, the firm has announced. The US Department of Justice had notified Ericsson that the firm has failed, as required, to hand over details of alleged corruption in Iraq to DoJ prosecutors. The admission comes days after it was revealed that Ericsson may have channelled cash to Islamic State terrorists and had made suspicious payments totalling millions of dollars to sustain its business in Iraq between 2011 and 2019. The announcement on Wednesday came as Ericsson struggled to contain a growing controversy over its alleged misconduct. It is the second time the multinational has been found to have broken its agreement with the DoJ. Ericsson’s shares have lost nearly a third of their value since further revelations about wrongdoing emerged last month. The latest disclosures originate from an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). It obtained confidential documents that recorded the results of internal inquiries commissioned by Ericsson into alleged corruption by the company around the world. The documents reveal how Ericsson is alleged to have helped pay bribes to IS in order to continue selling the company’s services after the terrorism group seized control of large parts of Iraq. The leaked documents were shared with ICIJ’s media partners, including the Guardian, the BBC and the Washington Post, and were published on Sunday. On Tuesday, the DOJ told Ericsson it believed the firm had broken the terms of a settlement reached in 2019. Under the settlement, Ericsson paid $1bn (£750m) to end a corruption investigation by the DoJ. The firm admitted it had paid tens of millions of dollars in corrupt payments through slush funds between 2000 and 2016 to win contracts in five countries. As part of what is known as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), Ericsson avoided court action provided it had disclosed all relevant information about its wrongdoing to the DoJ. Under the terms of the DPA, the department can launch a new prosecution if it believes Ericsson has not come clean about corruption allegations. The DoJ informed Ericsson on Tuesday that the information the firm had shared with prosecutors about alleged misconduct in Iraq between 2011 and 2019 was deemed to be “insufficient”. Ericsson said the DoJ had “determined that the company breached the DPA by failing to make subsequent disclosure” related to this alleged misconduct since the 2019 agreement. In its statement, the firm gave no details about the nature of the alleged corruption that had been withheld. Ericsson said it was “in communication with the DoJ regarding the facts and circumstances of the breach determination” and that it was “committed to cooperating with the DoJ to resolve the matter”. “At this stage it is premature to predict the outcome of this matter,” the firm added. In October, the DoJ told Ericsson it had “breached its obligations under the DPA by failing to provide certain documents and factual information”, although no details were made public on that occasion either.",News/Business,Ericsson admits breaking DoJ deal over Iraq corruption claims,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/02/ericsson-broke-doj-deal-iraq-corruption-claims-us-prosecutors-telecoms
3/3/2022,"Sonoma County is around a 90-minute drive from San Francisco, but feels a world away from the city, making it prime minibreak material for the Bay Area’s work hard, play hard crowd. And for epicurean international travellers exploring California on four wheels, Sonoma is what road trip dreams are made of, with picture-perfect vineyards and rolling hills, world-class restaurants and inviting tasting rooms to dip into along the way. California’s almost supernaturally fertile and biodiverse landscape gives rise to reliably excellent locally grown produce, all spectacularly showcased in a farm-to-table dining scene that is the envy of chefs around the globe. But nowhere is the Golden State’s abundance more evident than in the Sonoma valley – bordered to the east by the Mayacamas, and to the west by the Sonoma mountain range. Nestled in the valley, gorgeous vineyards, hip boutique hotels, amazing restaurants and more than 4,850 hectares (12,000 acres) of dedicated parkland amount to a vast idyll for wine lovers and food obsessives from around the globe. Start with the Three Sticks Wines tasting room in the landmark Vallejo-Castenada Adobe building, dating back to 1842, and then check out some of these other places: Spirit Works DistilleryEveryone knows Sonoma is synonymous with wineries, but the valley is also home to more than 50 breweries, cideries, and distilleries, with a reputation for one of the most vibrant craft drinks scenes on the planet. Spirit Works Distillery was awarded National Distillery of the Year in 2020 and voted Best Distillery in Sonoma County, for its commitment to the grain-to-glass philosophy of bringing in whole organic grains that are then milled, mashed, fermented and distilled, entirely on site. “Here in Sonoma County, the spirits scene really is booming and we’re proud to be a part of that new energy,” says head distiller Ashby Marshall, part of the husband-and-wife team who established Spirit Works in the city of Sebastopol in 2012. “We make award-winning vodkas and whiskies – but for British visitors, I always like to highlight our traditionally made sloe gin. Sloe gin isn’t so well-known in the US, but my husband is British and we love winning over new fans in our tastings.” The Spirit Works distillery and tasting room is located in The Barlow, a five-hectare (12-acre) open-air artisan marketplace on Sebastopol’s east side, with a community market, art galleries, cheesemakers and interiors stores among the 40-plus vendors. Make an afternoon of it. Flowers Vineyards and WinerySonoma is dotted with charming small towns, but many visitors find themselves especially seduced by Healdsburg and the surrounding wineries. For wine-lovers who care about organic and responsible farming methods, a visit to the House of Flowers in Healdsburg is a must. California native Chantal Forthun has led the winemaking team at Flowers Vineyards and Winery since 2012, prioritising sustainability, responsible growing and respecting the land and people of the Sonoma valley region. Forthun studied native yeasts for many years and has pioneered many “low intervention” winemaking techniques, although, as she says, “at Flowers, ‘minimal intervention’ doesn’t mean hands-off; it actually means more hands are involved in the preparation, requiring us to be present in each moment, through every step of the process.” The newly restored House of Flowers is a 1970s architectural delight with a stone-tiled fireplace, oak floors and cypress walls, reached through a shady redwood grove, offering wine-tastings of the house vintages of pinot noir, chardonnay and rosé alongside seasonal produce. It’s just a five-minute drive or 20-minute cycle (try Spoke Folk for rentals) from the independent galleries, bakeries and boutique hotels of downtown Healdsburg. Charles M Schulz MuseumSan Francisco has the excellent Cartoon Art Museum, but Sonoma County has the delightfully quirky Charles M Schulz Museum, dedicated to the creator of the Peanuts comic strip. For fans of Charlie Brown and Snoopy, this small but perfectly formed museum offers a delicious dose of childhood nostalgia and intriguing insights into this eternally popular franchise. Schulz, who moved his home and studio to Santa Rosa in 1969 and lived there until his death in 2000, drew some 18,000 strips in his lifetime, of which 7,000 are owned by the museum. There’s an oversized birdbath in the courtyard patio, a ceramic tile mural, and a recreation of Schulz’s studio. The museum is right round the corner from a favourite haunt of Schulz’s, a public ice rink with an on-site cafe where you can sip a hot chocolate while watching the skaters circle the rink. The locals love to reminisce about how Schulz ate breakfast or lunch at Snoopy’s Home Ice cafe virtually every single day. Jack London state historic parkMany visitors only associate Sonoma with food and wine, but the Sonoma valley is one of the most beautiful regions in California, and countless hiking, biking and kayaking opportunities are there for the taking. Perhaps the most appealing natural park in the region is Jack London state historic park, named for the literary legend and local hero. This park sits within the ancestral territory of the Coast Miwok, represented today by the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria. In spring, wildflowers proliferate in the woods and grasslands, while in autumn the park’s black oaks and big-leaf maples turn amber hues. But for many international visitors, it’s the giant redwoods that are the big draw, and these spectacular trees are beautifully showcased along the Giant Ancient Redwood Trail, a four-mile hike through grassy meadows and redwood-filled canyons. The nearby hamlet of Glen Ellen is also worth exploring, perhaps to pick up a picnic of artisan cheeses and freshly baked bread at Glen Ellen Village Market, before heading for the redwoods. Guerneville Bank ClubEver since the 1970s, LGBTQ+ travellers have claimed the Russian River valley resort town of Guerneville as their own, with the sleepy logging hamlet evolving naturally into one of the US’s most fun-loving destinations. The campsites, cute cabins, retro motels and spa hotels cater for a diverse influx of visitors from around the state, and today Guerneville possesses a progressive, relaxing, rustic charm – complemented by a cultured drinking and dining scene. An early stop on any visit to the town and Russian River wine region nearby has got to be Guerneville Bank Club, an iconic banking building now housing a historical society, wine vault and gallery, ice-cream dairy and bakery. This community of makers, bakers and historians has breathed new life into a 1920s landmark in downtown Guerneville, putting this Main Street location back on the map. There’s Chile Pies Baking Company, Nimble & Finn’s Homemade Ice-Cream and The Wine Vault, perfect for refuelling after a day canoeing downriver, or hiking the redwood trails of Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve.

3/3/2022,"Nestled in the beautiful Sierra Nevada foothills, Jamestown is a deep-dive into Gold Country history, a gateway to outdoorsy adventures in Yosemite national park and a front-row ticket to spectacular High Sierra views. Many visitors to Tuolumne County speed through en route to Yosemite, but missing out on Jamestown and Sonora means missing out on a fascinating chapter of Californian history. The California gold rush of 1848-1855 kicked off when gold was discovered in the Sierra Nevada foothills, bringing in an influx of 300,000 prospectors to California, reinvigorating the US economy, creating railway boomtowns and propelling California into statehood – and cementing its reputation as the land of opportunity. Jamestown was founded in 1848, one mile from the first gold find in Tuolumne County, at Woods Crossing. Today, downtown Jamestown looks much as it did a century ago, with dry-laid stone buildings, charming Queen Anne-style wooden frame buildings with balconies and wooden boardwalks lining Main Street. The forty-niners, as the gold miners were called, are long gone, but a slow drive along Highway 49, past battered boomtowns and oak-fronted saloons, is a true taste of those crazy years that birthed this state. And Railtown 1897, a state historic park, offers 45-minute steam train trips through California’s wild west, a real joy for rail travel lovers. For culturally curious travellers hoping for a history hit alongside outdoorsy adventures, Jamestown’s breweries, quaint antique stores, bakeries, restaurants and historic hotels make it an atmospheric and charming base for adventures farther afield. The National HotelThis historic hotel is one of the oldest hotels in California, established in 1859 to house miners, railroad executives and other notables in relative luxury. Longstanding proprietor Stephen Willey, who has owned the hotel since 1974, has stayed true to the Old West charm of the property, carefully restoring all nine bedrooms with Victorian brass beds, antique walnut armoires and chintzy wallpaper. There’s a completely charming and original saloon, a vine-strewn patio, and a showstopper of a front balcony where all guests can linger with a sarsaparilla. “We get all sorts of guests coming through here,” says Willey. “They come because they want to stay in a piece of gold rush history, or they want to see where the western movies were set. And we’re just an hour from Yosemite, so we get visitors from all over the world coming here.” Overnight guests even have the option of paying for their stays with gold dust. “We’ve got the scales, we’re tracking daily prices, and if guests want to pay for their rooms, meals and drinks with a few pinches, we’ll be ready,” says Willey. Railtown 1897 state historic parkJust a few blocks east of Jamestown’s Main Street, this 10-hectare (26-acre) collection of trains and railroad memorabilia has been used as a set for a string of films and TV shows, including Back to the Future III, Unforgiven and High Noon. Sacramento’s Rail Museum attracts serious rail buffs, but Railtown 1897 is a more romantic, photogenic immersion in rail history … and cinematic history. There’s the original depot, headquarters and roundhouse of the Sierra Railway, which was built in 1897 to carry miners, supplies, lumber and ore. But the big draw is perhaps Sierra No 3, a 19th-century locomotive dubbed “the movie star locomotive” thanks to its lengthy list of film and TV appearances, from the 1930 Gary Cooper classic The Texan to cult 1994 neo-western Bad Girls, starring Drew Barrymore.

Gianelli VineyardsA Tuscan-inspired, award-winning vineyard isn’t exactly what most visitors expect when they visit a gold rush town such as Jamestown, but this town is full of surprises. The land that is now Gianelli Vineyards was originally purchased by an Italian adventurer named Giovani Rocca in the 1800s, who married into the Gianelli family and used the land as a working cattle ranch, gold mining camp, and a major stagecoach stop. In the early 2000s, having ascertained that the soil in Jamestown mirrors the soil profile of Tuscany, the first vines were planted … and today Gianelli Vineyards is home to 18 different estate-grown varietals, some rarely found outside Italy, such as vermentino, fiano, primitivo and aglianico. These days, the vineyard is run by two brothers from Jamestown, Cody and Christian LaPertche, who heads up vineyard operations. “I always loved this area, and I’m grateful I didn’t have to move away for a career in winemaking … because every single day here is exciting,” says Cody. “The tasting room is really beautiful, situated above the vineyard with stunning views of the estate and the Sierra Nevada. Guests can try 20 different wines, but we highlight mainly Italian varietals that are perfectly suited to the Tuscan-like climate of Tuolumne County.” Morelia Mexican RestaurantFor European travellers, the abundance of family-run Mexican restaurants across California offers a major upgrade to any road trip, and Jamestown’s Morelia is as authentic and friendly as it gets. Morelia has been in the Pulido family for years, and chef Ofelia Pulido Morales whips up carnitas, tamales, flautas and a house-favourite chimichanga, alongside grilled seafood, steak and chicken dishes. This friendly, family-run joint is housed in a historic Victorian residence on Main Street, dating back to 1906, right across the road from the clapboard-fronted National Hotel; it’s surely a contender for the most atmospheric and charming setting for a Mexican restaurant in California. With just 12 tables, it’s an intimate and cosy dining room for eating in with a Modelo, but during the pandemic it began a roaring delivery trade and still services local hotels … just be sure to add their own bottled margarita mix. Bear Tent Brewing CompanyThere’s small-batch brewing … and then there’s the small-town nanobrewery. Bear Tent Brewing Company is a farm brewery on Main Street in the heart of Jamestown, and the brewery patio is one of the best places in town to sip a cold cream ale after a day hiking, fishing, biking, horse-riding or rock-climbing. Founded in 2017 by two beer-loving high-school friends, John McGettigan and Ben Deutsch, the pair took over a site that used to belong to McGettigan’s grandfather and got the brewery ball rolling with two three-barrel and one seven-barrel brewing system. Currently, Bear Tent grows their own Cascade and Chinook hops, and there is a strong emphasis on locally grown and sustainable ingredients. For Jamestown locals, it’s been a thrill to see a pub return to this site on Main Street. Bear Tent gets its name from the roadhouse tavern that used to occupy the site. “Grizzly Adams had a mining claim across the street,” says McGettigan.

3/3/2022,"Russian military operations against Ukraine are moving beyond the initial period in which the aim was creating quick superiority. Many observers have been surprised at Russia’s failure to achieve early gains and the defeats it has suffered. The heroism and resistance of Ukrainian forces have initially constrained Russia. Ukrainian command and control systems – the ability to communicate, move and fight – are still functioning. Ukraine’s air defence is still standing, thus denying Russia the superiority Moscow would have hoped to achieve quickly. Russian units have also made tactical-operational mistakes. Troops have so far failed to quickly take over urban centres, although many are now contested. Russia’s strategy was probably premised on the false assumption that Ukraine would crumble quickly and surrender. As a result, the preparation needed for a follow-up on-the-ground invasion has not happened. Instead, it seems Russian troops quickly disbanded into smaller units that did not execute orders properly. They are taking a lot of casualties and hardware losses. There are signs that Russian troops have low motivation to fight. Field commanders were likely not given the exact extent of their mission, limiting battlefield readiness – there is, indeed, a difference between “liberating” Donbas and conducting the siege of Kyiv. Untrained and inexperienced conscripts were also reportedly forced to sign contracts under duress to fight in Ukraine. International reaction against the war has been united and coherent. A fresh round of sanctions has caused the rouble to plummet. Several Russian banks have been cut off from the Swift payment system, and the Central Bank of Russia has been placed under sanctions. Military assistance from democratic nations is trickling in, with the European Union and even Germany stepping up to aid Ukraine with offensive weapons. The Kremlin is also hampered by what is happening in Russia itself. The fabricated narrative of a “defensive operation” against “fascists and Nazis” in Ukraine terrorising Donbas civilians feels increasingly contested. Meanwhile, Ukraine is excelling at counter-psychological ops by sending Russians videos of their captured soldiers pleading to stop the war – a tactic that could nevertheless backfire. In a few weeks, the impact of international sanctions might start having severe consequences for ordinary citizens. The “body bag count” might also start changing mentalities, especially among the families of deployed soldiers. Nevertheless, there are still enablers fuelling the Kremlin’s endgame: the uncompromising surrender of Ukraine, its complete demilitarisation, and the international recognition of occupied Crimea as Russian. Seizing more parts of Ukrainian territory – beyond Donbas and Crimea – will be used as a bargaining chip. This explains why Moscow is bent on taking Kyiv, quickly accomplishing regime change and dictating new political conditions through puppet proxies. All the more since Moscow would use the fall of the government to turn the Ukrainian armed forces into “terrorists”, further justifying violence to suppress any insurrection. So far we have witnessed Russian military “restraint”. Soldiers were ordered not to shoot civilians. Military operations have been focused on emptying stocks of precision-guided munitions, and not conducting carpet-bombing. However, the situation is changing: mass fires and shelling are happening increasingly in Kharkiv and Kyiv – and a column of heavy infantry units is now approaching the capital. Such strikes will drastically increase the number of civilian casualties. This is the start of Russia reassessing its tactical-operational objectives and returning to brutal tactics seen previously in the likes of Chechnya and Syria: indiscriminate, concentrated fire through ground artillery and tactical aviation. Many ground units and artillery support are being mobilised from across the borders with Ukraine and Belarus. As Russian forces try to capture towns and cities, the conflict will transform from movement warfare to urban and siege warfare – a worst-case scenario for both sides, as the conflict will drag on. The Kremlin is currently approaching the war through a “stop and go” logic. Namely a few days of intense fighting, followed by an initial offer for “diplomatic” talks – with no real intention of achieving anything. Failed discussions give yet another excuse for Moscow to go into unrestricted war; the chances of diplomacy look slim at this point. Vladimir Putin has embarked on dangerous signalling – by giving an order to put nuclear forces on “special combat duty”. Russia’s nuclear doctrine states that Moscow would consider a nuclear strike in the case of an “existential conventional military threat” – except it is hard to assess what that genuinely means. As the western response grows bolder, undeterred by Russian threats, irritation could lead to frustration. A hampered Kremlin could lead to a desperate Putin, especially as his options of off-ramps and face-saving close down, or if the pressure starts mounting in Russia itself. If blaming or reshuffling his military leaders or government does not work, this could lead to even more dangerous and irrational decisions being made by Putin. As democratic nations explore coercive measures against Moscow, they will need to manage escalation with an increasingly isolated Kremlin. It’s a path that could lead to miscalculation and tactical errors when engaging a country with its back against the wall.
