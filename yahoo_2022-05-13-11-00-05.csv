5/13/2022,"Over a year after the installation of a comfort women statue in Mitte of central Berlin, Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida asked German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to remove the statue.

“Comfort women” is a euphemism for the women from mostly Asian nations who were enslaved into brothels by the Japanese military during World War II.

A pro-Korean civic group erected the statue in September 2020 with the approval of local authorities. The installation was allowed to stay for one year and was extended for an extra year.

In October 2020, the Mitte district initially requested for a local Korean group to remove the statue before deciding to leave it. Berlin’s mayor, Michael Müller, also advocated for a future memorial that addresses sexual violence in broader terms.

Japan has repeatedly made requests to the Mitte district that the statue’s permit be removed. The Mitte district has denied the requests and expressed hope that Japan and South Korea would reach an agreement on the statue’s presence.

During a press conference on Wednesday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno shared that during a meeting in late April between Kashida and Scholz in Tokyo, Kashida expressed continued disappointment to the German at the statue’s continued installation.

“The prime minister said it was extremely regrettable to see the comfort women statue remain and sought cooperation again from the German side,” Matsuno said per Kyodo News. “We will approach various parties concerned, tenaciously explain our government’s stance and call for swift removal of the statue.”

As tensions over the issue of recognizing comfort women persist between South Korea and Japan, activists and remaining survivors are continuing to fight for justice “until the very end.""

5/13/2022,"Cushman & Wakefield is appealing a NY court's order to turn over years of valuations by 5 appraisers who worked on Trump properties. The real estate services giant says doing so would violate the privacy of some 1,000 clients. NY AG Letitia James alleges the 5 appraisers made repeated misstatements on Trump's behalf. Global real estate services giant Cushman & Wakefield is appealing a court order from last month that requires them to turn over years worth of property valuations by five appraisers who worked on Trump Organization properties. The appeal, filed in a New York appellate court in Manhattan, pushes back against recent subpoenas from state Attorney General Letitia James, who is winding up a three-year investigation into the former president's business. The Cushman records James wants — and which Cushman is fighting against turning over — center on five Cushman employees who did the appraisals for the Trump National Golf Club near Los Angeles, 40 Wall Street in Manhattan, and Seven Springs, a 212-acre estate in New York's Westchester County. The five targeted appraisers, ""have made repeated misstatements in the documents we've seen so far,"" concerning those three properties, a lawyer for the AG's office, Austin Thompson, argued in a Manhattan court hearing last month. ""We're worried about misstatements contained in [the five employees'] appraisals, and whether they have been repeated more often than we've already identified,"" Thompson said in court last month, in defending their subpoena. In the case of the golf club and the Westchester estate, the Cushman appraisers ""crafted a development timeline"" for the properties and then ""falsely attributed it to somebody else"" as part of a tax-break scheme, Thompson said. As for 40 Wall Street, the AG has alleged that Cushman appraisals of Trump's interest in the 70-story skyscraper more than doubled in the three years between 2012 and 2015. Trump used the higher appraisal in securing a $160 million loan. James wants the three Cushman appraisers who handled 40 Wall Street to each turn over all of their other appraisals in the ""Downtown Manhattan Office Market"" between 2012 and 2015. She has demanded six years of additional appraisals each from the Cushman employee who appraised Seven Springs, and from the employee who appraised the LA-area golf club. Cushman attorney Sawnie A. McEntire has said in court hearings that the subpoenas are ""outrageous and overbroad,"" and that complying would violate the privacy of some 1,000 clients unrelated to the Trump Organization. And the clients would know. Each would have to be told that their appraisals had been subpoenaed, as required by their engagement contracts. In arguments during a Manhattan court hearing on April 25, McEntire also said that Timothy Barnes, the Cushman employee who appraised Seven Springs, ""actually aggressively pushed back"" against the Trump Organization's demands. Cushman has more than cooperated, the lawyer also said during the hearing. ""Over the last three years, my client has responded to twelve separate subpoenas,"" he said, in arguing before New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron for them to be quashed. ""My clients have incurred billions of dollars in attorney fees and expenses, in complying with their subpoenas,"" he said. Trump was a major client for Cushman for years. The firm appraised multiple Trump Organization properties, including Trump Tower and Trump International Hotel and Tower in Manhattan, Trump Tower in Chicago, and the former president's golf clubs in Miami, Bedminster, NJ and Briarcliff Manor, NY. But Cushman issued a press release on Jan. 13, 2021, saying it was cutting ties with the company due to Trump's involvement, days prior, in the attack on the Capitol. Cushman is also appealing James' subpoenaed demand for documents relevant to that tie-cutting. Lawyers for the AG have suggested that the real reason the firm split with Trump last year was the AG's probe; they want Cushman to hand over any communications concerning the split between the company and its board of directors. Cushman boasts 400 offices in 60 countries and last year claimed more than $9 billion in annual revenue. The firm has until May 27 to comply with the AG's subpoenas. ""While we are filing this appeal out of an obligation to protect the privacy of our clients and preserve the integrity of our client relationships, we wish to continue working with the Office of the Attorney General and hope for a swift and successful conclusion to the investigation,"" a company spokesperson said. ""Cushman & Wakefield's appraisers acted with the utmost integrity and professional judgement in our former dealings with the Trump Organization,"" the spokesperson said. ""We believe the evidence is clear that Cushman's appraisers exercised independent judgment and frequently refused or rejected suggestions from The Trump Organization or its outside counsel."" James' investigation is looking at what she has called ""repeated misstatements"" in property valuations that former president Donald Trump has used to win hundreds of millions of dollars in bank loans and tax breaks. James has said in filings since January that her office is investigating not only Trump, but any individual or company that may have helped Trump use misstatements about the value of his assets for financial gain.

5/13/2022,"Felix Kjellberg, popularly known as PewDiePie on YouTube, has moved to Japan with his wife Marzia and their pet dogs.

The Swedish gaming streamer, who has over 111 million subscribers on YouTube, documented their journey from London to Japan in his latest video upload published on May 10.

 

In the 14-minute clip, Kjellberg is seen getting his 5-year business visa approved and trying to sort out the best way to relocate from Brighton, where he has lived since 2013, with his pugs, whose breathing issues prevent them from traveling through cargo.

Not wanting to risk the safety of their pets, the couple rented a private jet.

""We're flying private jet because my dog is too fat,"" Kjellberg said in jest.

The move had been a long-time dream for Kjellberg, who has often talked about purchasing a house in Japan back in 2019.

""For so long we doubted whether we could even make this move, and we went through all the ups and downs, and obviously it's been a really long journey,"" Kjellberg said in the video. ""But I just really, really appreciate everyone who was supportive of us going ... it just feels amazing to be here, finally.""

The YouTuber told his viewers that they are “going to take some days to settle in” and “can't wait for the next chapter of [their] lives.”

Kjellberg was able to finally make the move after Japan relaxed its COVID-19 entry rules for some visa-holders.

While the country remains closed to tourists, Japan started opening up its borders to allow in foreign business visitors, students and other new residents in March.

5/13/2022,"By Gwladys Fouche and Victoria Klesty KIRKENES, Norway (Reuters) - Kirkenes, a Norwegian town a stone's throw from Russia, was for over three decades a symbol of cross-border harmony in the Arctic. That came to a crashing end when Russia invaded Ukraine. Since then people have been adapting to the new realities. One is the prospect that neighbouring Finland could join Norway in NATO, with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto expected to say on Thursday it should apply to the military alliance. Companies here are seeking to reduce their dependence on doing business with Russia even as Norway has made some exceptions to international sanctions. Kirkenes residents can cross into Russia with a visa-free permit while Russians can come and work in the area. Out of the town's 3,500 residents, 400 are Russians. There are also about 30 Ukrainians. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, ""many have felt grief, anger, frustration,"" said Lene Norum Bergeng, mayor of Soer-Varanger municipality which includes Kirkenes. ""It has been a surreal time. We have lived in peace for many years and now our neighbour is going to war with one of its neighbours. It has affected us all,"" she said from her office, on the same square as the Russian consulate. From Kirkenes, the Russian border is a 15-minute drive away while Finland's is 50 minutes away. Both are closer than the neighbouring Norwegian municipality. ""It is up to Finland to decide whether they want to join NATO,"" said Norum Bergeng. ""Should they want to, we should welcome then. I am very glad that Norway is part of NATO."" LIVING TOGETHER Street signs in both Norwegian and Russian were put up decades ago to welcome Russians. A petition is now circulating to take them down, though there are as yet not enough signatures for the city council to discuss it, the mayor said. Russian residents Reuters spoke to said they still felt as welcome as before the invasion. ""I have had no problems, no one has come up to me and said 'hey, you Russian',"" said welder Gleb Karionov, 43, during a break in his shift at the Kimek shipyard. Similarly, a Ukrainian refugee who arrived in Kirkenes in April said the Russians she had met had been ""very kind"" to her. ""They are not aggressive. And we try not to speak about politics and such provocative questions,"" said Katerina Bezruk, 27, a teacher who fled the eastern region of Luhansk with her two-year-old daughter Arena and now lives with her aunt. Some are finding new meaning to their work. Evgeny Goman, a theatre director from Murmansk who has lived in Kirkenes since January, is working with Russian artists in exile to present different voices of Russia, away from the militaristic officialdom. ""With the start of the war, we really understood why we do art...why it is a powerful instrument,"" the 42-year-old said at the art gallery that houses a regional collective of curators and artists, Girls on the Bridge. ECONOMIC HIT At the Kimek shipyard, which last year derived 70% of its revenues from fitting Russian vessels, CEO Greger Mannsverk worries about restructuring the business without losing his 80 employees to other employers, 15 of whom are Russians. While non-EU Norway has applied most international sanctions, it has not shut its ports to Russian fishing vessels, a lifeline for the ports of Arctic Norway like Kirkenes. Mannsverk would have laid off half the shipyard's staff had Norway applied that particular sanction, he said. Kimek's facility in Murmansk continues to operate, independently from the main facility in Kirkenes. ""I am planning for a future when the Russian clients are not the major ones. The percentage today is 70%, maybe it should be 20%,"" he said at the cavernous yard where a Russian trawler was being readied. Will cross-border cooperation resume to the full sometimes in the future? Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere is hopeful it will. ""There will be a day after, I don't know when,"" he said during a visit to the town. ""I think the spirit of the people living in this municipality is that borders should be respected, but there should also be contacts. We have to live through it.""
