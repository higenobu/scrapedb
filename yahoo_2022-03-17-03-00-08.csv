3/17/2022,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy announced Tuesday night that a fourth Russian general has been killed in Moscow's war in his country. Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko later identified the slain officer as Maj. Gen. Oleg Mityaev, the 46-year-old commander of Russia's 150th motorized rifle division. Gerashchenko said Mityaev died Tuesday as Russian forces stormed Mariupol, The Associated Press reports. Russia has not confirmed the death. Ukraine's armed forces ""have adeptly exploited Russia's lack of maneuver, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on the invading forces,"" Britain's Ministry of Defense said in its early Wednesday public intelligence assessment. A senior U.S. defense official estimated Tuesday that Ukraine and Russia both retain about 90 percent of their original combat power, and said Russia has now launched more than 950 missiles at Ukrainian targets in the first 20 days of the war. Russia's ground invasion appears to be stalled, and on Tuesday evening Ukrainian forces repelled an attack on Kharkiv, the country's second largest city, according to regional leader Oleh Synehubov. The Ukrainian army was even able ""to push the enemy back beyond its previous position,"" handing Russia a ""shameful defeat,"" he added. Ukraine's military also destroyed a number of Russian attack helicopters and other military vehicles parked at the Kherson International Airport on Tuesday, CNN reports, citing satellite images from Planet Labs. ""It's the most destructive known strike the Ukrainian military has conducted against Russian helicopters during the war, with at least three Russian helicopters seen on fire, or destroyed, at the airport.""

My group of friends are on the nerdy side and enjoy playing video games, watching movies and D&D. My fiancee’s group all come from wealthy families and are very girly. Fiancee and I do love each other, and plan on spending the rest of our lives together.” “I don’t mind hanging with her friends, but they can be very judgmental and make comments. Fiancee invited me to come out with her friends to celebrate and I did get dressed up. The one friend wanted to try a new fancy restaurant that had opened. Most of the food items were over $20 and I ordered a large appetizer as my main dish.” Tinashe is calling the shots: But when it came time to pay the bill, the Reddit poster felt ambushed. “Fiancee ordered a salad and cocktail,” he explained. “Her friends ordered a bunch of drinks and expensive entrees. When it came time to pay the bill, her one friend looks at me and says Fiancee said you would be treating us out tonight. I gave Fiancee a look and told the waiter to split the entire check. I only paid for Fiancee and me.” “Fiancee didn’t speak to me the entire ride back to our apartment. I did bring up what happened at the restaurant and Fiancee got defensive saying that I shouldn’t have made her look like a fool in front of her friends.” “Your fiancee made herself look like a fool by promising something she had no right to promise. That’s a big red flag,” one person said. “She should have been upfront. Why do people feel so entitled to spend other people’s money,” another commented. “You should really think about if you want to spend the rest of your life with this woman,” someone added.

3/17/2022,"Pennsylvania authorities announced this week that no charges will be filed in the death of a Black man who was fatally shot nine times during a hunting trip. In a statement to The Daily Beast, an attorney for Peter Spencer’s family said that they disagree with the Venango County district attorney’s decision—but are “not surprised” by the outcome. “This is the type of behavior we have seen from the [Pennsylvania] state police and Venango County district attorney from the outset,” attorney Paul Jubas wrote. He added that the family will hold a press conference about the decision next week. Spencer, a Black Jamaican immigrant, was shot and killed Dec. 12 after his pregnant fiancée dropped him off in a remote area of Rockland County for a hunting trip with a friend and former co-worker, who is white, and four other men. Several hours into the trip, Spencer was shot by the co-worker nine times. The men claimed that it was self-defense. District Attorney Shawn White said Spencer was “acting crazy,” firing off an AK-47, after taking hallucinogenic mushrooms on the trip. He was shot after pointing the gun at his friend and ordering another man to get down on the ground at gunpoint, witnesses said, according to White. At one point, he allegedly claimed he was going to “shoot up the place.” “It was the last 10 minutes where his demeanor escalated to the point of no reasoning, loss of reality and absolutely no listening to trying to deescalate the situation,” White said, adding that authorities found the hallucinogen psilocin in his system. The district attorney ultimately determined the shooting was justified under the state’s “stand your ground law,” the Castle Doctrine. ‘Murdered My Son All Over Again’: Anger Erupts Over 2-Year Sentence for Ex-Cop Who Killed Daunte Wright In a previous interview with The Daily Beast, Spencer’s mother, Icilda Hunter, questioned the group’s narrative of how the shooting unfolded. “They said Peter was going crazy shooting at people in a crowd,” she said, adding that police had told her no one else got shot that night. “Nobody got hurt, but he is shot and killed dead?” Hunter insisted her son was too afraid to even take pain medication and would not use illicit drugs. She added that it doesn’t make sense to her why he would randomly start shooting others if he had no way to leave the hunting grounds, which were owned by his friend. Hunter told The Daily Beast that the coroner determined six gunshots had penetrated Spencer’s chest, two were found in his bicep, and the final one went through his mouth. However, the coroner could not figure out exactly how and from which direction the bullets entered Spencer’s body, she said. Before he was killed, Spencer’s family and friends said that he was in the process of getting his trucking license. “I'm just tired of not getting any answers from these people,” Hunter said.

3/17/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday issued a warning to Russians he described as traitors and said the West wanted to try to use them as a ""fifth column"" to destroy the country. The Kremlin leader assailed Russians who he said were more mentally aligned with the West than Russia and said the Russian people would quickly be able to tell the difference between traitors and patriots. ""Of course they (the West) will try to bet on the so-called fifth column, on traitors - on those who earn their money here, but live over there. Live, not in the geographical sense, but in the sense of their thoughts, their slavish thinking,"" he said. Addressing government ministers nearly three weeks into Russia's war in Ukraine, Putin angrily attacked the West and those Russians he said were abetting it. ""The collective West wants to divide our society... to provoke civil confrontation in Russia and to use its fifth column to strive to achieve its aim. And there is one aim - the destruction of Russia,"" he said. That aim would not be achieved, he said. ""Any people, and especially the Russian people, will always be able to distinguish the true patriots from the scum and the traitors, and just to spit them out like a midge that accidentally flew into their mouths,"" he continued. ""I am convinced that this natural and necessary self-cleansing of society will only strengthen our country, our solidarity, cohesion and readiness to meet any challenge. Putin made the comments at a government meeting broadcast on national television to discuss measures of economic support after the West imposed an unprecedented wave of sanctions on Russia for its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Officials in Russia describe Moscow's offensive as a ""special military operation"". Thousands of people have been detained in Russia while protesting against the war.

3/17/2022,"⚡️ Read the full article on Motorious Early on the morning of March 6 all hell broke loose in North Fort Myers, Florida. A serious car crash injured multiple people, some of them critically. Now authorities are trying to piece together exactly what happened before the crash. Find out the latest in the Motorious Podcast here. According to Florida Highway Patrol, a Mercedes sedan and a Lamborghini were both traveling at a high rate of speed on Business U.S. 41. Those vehicles collided after the Mercedes hit a curb, sending it careening into the Lamborghini. After the collision, the Mercedes ran off the road, hitting some bushes and trees, eventually overturning into the Caloosahatchee River. The driver, a 40-year-old man from Port Charlotte, was critically injured. A 27-year-old female passenger suffered serious injuries and a 32-year-old male got away with only minor injuries. As for the Lamborghini, after it was struck it veered into the oncoming traffic lanes, spun out, flipped, and then hit a light pole. The Italian car then was engulfed in flames, leaving what little charred wreckage you see in the on-scene photo. It’s miraculous nobody was killed. The 34-year-old male driver from Port Charlotte only suffered minor injury. However, his 30-year-old female passenger wasn’t nearly as lucky, suffering serious injuries. Since it was last reported, the crash was still under investigation, so any charges were still pending. A witness told one local reporter the Mercedes and Lamborghini “going by it just sounded like people yeah racing.” However, a Florida Highway Patrol spokesman said he wasn’t able to confirm if the two driver were racing each other. He also emphasized that charges would be coming, stating “what our roadways are not… are racetracks.” As if that weren’t enough, authorities say a third vehicle hit some debris left in the road from the crash.
