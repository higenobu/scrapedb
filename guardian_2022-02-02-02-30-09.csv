2/2/2022,"A dispute over the takeover of one of the UK’s biggest GP practice operators by the US healthcare giant Centene Corporation reached the high court today, in a case which could overturn approval for a deal condemned by campaigners as “privatisation by stealth” of the NHS. The request for a judicial review, which will be heard in the high court in London on Tuesday and Wednesday, was crowdfunded by a coalition of NHS campaign groups and the Unite union. It is being brought by Anjna Khurana, an NHS Patient and Islington councillor. She claims she is one of 375,000 patients across London who were only informed of the takeover of their GP surgeries after the event.  Health campaign groups Keep Our NHS Public, 999 Call for the NHS and We Own It have joined Unite in bringing the case. Two crowdfunding campaigns by Khurana have raised more than £77,000 from the public. A year ago, Operose Health, a UK subsidiary of Centene, acquired the privately owned AT Medics, which was set up in 2004 by six NHS GPs and ran 37 GP practices across 49 sites in London. The merger created the largest private supplier of GP services in the UK. The group now serves 570,000 patients across 67 practices, and employs 1,500 healthcare professionals, including 350 GPs. Alongside GP practices, Centene’s UK interests include Circle Health Group, , one of Britain’s biggest private hospital operators. A coalition of doctors, campaigners and academics has voiced concerns in a letter sent last year to the then health secretary, Matt Hancock, describing the takeover as “an example of the privatisation of the NHS by stealth”, and asking him to order an investigation by the Care Quality Commission. They claimed at the time the change of control was approved for eight practices in the London boroughs of Camden, Islington and Haringey in a virtual meeting on 17 December that lasted less than nine minutes, during which no mention was made of Centene and not a single question was asked. Approval was granted by the North Central London clinical commissioning group (NCL CCG), a local NHS body that purchases health services from GPs, hospitals and others using taxpayer funds. The judicial review will focus on the lack of consultation of patients, and will ask the court to squash the decision by NCL CCG. Since the news broke, hundreds of patients, councillors and members of the public have written letters and protested outside surgeries. Khurana said: “Like everyone else, I want to feel I can rely on my GP to be on my side. That is what we get with the NHS. But without my knowledge, my surgery has been sold to a giant American healthcare company, one with a very poor reputation. How can that be right? I needed to stand up and make my voice heard. So many people have been in touch to let me know they support me that I know I am not alone. We cannot allow this stealth privatisation of the NHS to carry on.” The court will rule whether, in making their decision, the NHS Commissioners acted unlawfully in three respects: misdirection – they failed to consider all the implications of the takeover because they assumed they had no choice but to accept and approve the proposal; lack of due diligence – they failed to give due consideration to the risk to patients, if the GP contracts they agreed to transfer to Operose Health turned out not to meet its parent company Centene’s profitability targets; and lack of consultation/involvement of patients. Dr Louise Irvine, a London GP and member of Keep Our NHS Public, said: “Of course patients are worried. When a large American corporation like Centene takes over this many GP practices we have to question their motive. It’s a deeply worrying situation and I am delighted that the high court has seen the important public interest in this case.” Doctors in Unite supported a protest outside the high court at the Royal Courts of Justice, with more protests planned on Wednesday. The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “This is a landmark case in the fight against the accelerating pace of privatisation of the NHS in England. Unite, with 100,000 members in the health service, fully supports the judicial review. We will not allow our GP services to be hived off to profit-hungry American private healthcare companies.” Operose and Centene have been contacted for comment.",News/Business,US healthcare giant’s takeover of UK GP practices lands in high court ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/01/us-healthcare-giants-takeover-of-uk-gp-practices-lands-in-high-court
2/2/2022,"The Saudi International may draw glances at present but it is not really a major problem for golf’s ecosystem. It is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Saudi Arabia’s ongoing, ultimate disruption plan. On Tuesday morning Greg Norman, the frontman for the golf operation of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, promised that the 10-event international series on the Asian Tour was “just the beginning”. Norman will believe this, even if the general tone of his carefully controlled press conference was uninspiring. Plenty of rhetoric, very little substance. “The most compelling indicator for me is the number of calls we have had from corporations and other individuals excited about the opportunity,” Norman said. Agents of footballers are suddenly very interested in Newcastle United, too. Bottomless pits of cash tend to have that effect.  As players flock to Jeddah this week to collect exorbitant appearance fees the rest of us can shake heads at the lunacy of it all. Nobody much cares about the Saudi International but those inside the ropes are also barely interested about the scepticism attached to their involvement. Players keep heads down, avoid awkward questions about the butchering of a journalist or human rights atrocities, bank the dollars and slip home via private jet. We are supposed to accept that “global players” keen to “grow the game” have more in mind than tsunamis hitting their bank accounts. For existing tours, the Saudi International is a bit of a nuisance. The international series merely could be but the more fascinating part of the picture is Saudi’s desire to make players commit to their platform and ultimately move towards a Super Golf League. Should they do so – barring u-turns or legal challenges – the unwillingness of the DP World and PGA Tours to work in alliance with Saudi will fracture the golf environment completely. Logically, the Saudis have pursued deals with individuals at the latter stages of their careers for whom a guaranteed payday of tens of millions of dollars triggers the rubbing of hands. Younger golfers are also known to be interested. Should, for argument’s sake, Bryson DeChambeau, Phil Mickelson, Henrik Stenson, Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood be tempted by this promised land then their future involvement in the Ryder Cup either as captains or players becomes almost impossible to square. The debate in this case would be a furious one; is it fair for players to effectively turn their backs on an event that has done so much for their profile, or would administrators on either side of the Atlantic be wrong to ostracise them? Even in the short-term, if Europe cannot or will not appoint Stenson as the captain for 2023 in Rome because of Saudi links then their Ryder Cup environment is undermined. And that, whatever the rights and wrongs, is a key issue. Two discussions with high-profile players at last week’s Dubai Desert Classic resonated. One was adamant that, as a businessman, he is fully entitled to exert maximum value for professional services and provide for his family accordingly. When I pointed out the public perception that sportsmen of his standing already have sufficient wealth, the response was that nobody would choose to downscale their way of life if there was an alternative. I actually admired his candour. Player two stated a belief that Saudi’s staging of golf tournaments increases focus on the kingdom and, in turn, should force them to improve upon behaviour and policies. Simply shutting a country off, under this theory, serves no actual purpose. Nonetheless, this notion of a force for good is contradicted by the unwillingness of golfers so far to speak out on Saudi’s hitherto appalling human rights record when in this very domain. While afforded a captive audience, golfers instead shuffle uncomfortably and trot out the wholly unsatisfactory line that they are “not politicians”. They are also being paid to front up the “new” Saudi Arabia. Altruism this is not. Norman spoke effusively about his connection with the Asian Tour. It is worth remembering that the Saudi International was the domain of the DP World Tour before that entity forged a strategic alliance with the PGA Tour. Yes, the DP World Tour’s earlier dance with the Saudis was dubious in itself but it is amusing to hear Norman’s chat about Asian opportunity as if this was always the grand plan. What the Asian Tour does is provide the Saudis with legitimacy via, for example, world ranking points as are actually wildly distorted when fortunes are being paid in appearance money to prop-up tournaments. On Sunday, the winner of the fourth Saudi International will be named and instantly forgotten in the wider world. Worthy of more attention is the potential impact of the broader scheme.",Sport/Sport,Saudi Arabia’s disruption plan spells trouble for golf’s main tours | Ewan Murray,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/01/saudi-arabias-disruption-plan-spells-trouble-for-golfs-main-tours
2/2/2022,"Leonard Fenton, who has died aged 95, was approaching 60 when he joined the original cast of EastEnders in 1985 as Dr Harold Legg, the friendly Jewish GP and much-loved pillar of the community. He continued in the BBC soap for 34 years, appearing in more than 250 episodes. The character was six years older than Fenton and widowed during the second world war when his wife was killed by a bomb. He was already at retirement age in the first episode, but he continued to serve the fictional Walford’s residents – and enjoy reminiscences with Dot Cotton (June Brown), Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin) and Lou Beale (Anna Wing). In the serial’s early days, he helped Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff) come to terms with the cot death of her baby and humoured the hypochondriacal Dot.  But his judgment was sometimes brought into question, such as when he decided not to tell Colin Russell (Michael Cashman) he was showing early signs of multiple sclerosis and failed to diagnose Vicki, the daughter of Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), with meningitis, resulting in the three-year-old almost dying and Harold retiring. Nevertheless, he was back at his Albert Square surgery within months and continued to treat residents until his official retirement in 1997. Fenton returned in the role on and off, with Harold popping in to catch up with old friends. In 2018, when he gave Dot the news that he was dying of cancer, she insisted that he move in with her. Fenton and Brown were together for the GP’s final moments the following year as Harold reminisced about meeting his late wife in the 1930s: “And I kissed her. And she kissed me back. The most perfect kiss ever. What I would give...” As his eyes closed, Dot told him: “Go and kiss her. Go and kiss her again.” An East Ender himself, Fenton was born Leonard Finestein in Stepney to Fanny (nee Goldberg), of Latvian descent, and Morris Finestein, a women’s garment-maker whose parents came to Britain from Lithuania. Like his soap character, Leonard remembered marches by Oswald Mosley and his Blackshirts in east London in the 1930s, and during the second world war his Jewish family changed their name to Fenton. On a happier note, he recalled: “My family’s doctor in Bethnal Green was a kind and caring man. Dr Legg is in the same mould – an intelligent man who has chosen to remain working in the East End community in which he grew up.” When war broke out, Fenton’s school, Raine’s, in Bethnal Green, was evacuated to Brighton. He then qualified as a civil engineer by taking a degree at King’s College London, did his national service as an officer with the Royal Engineers and spent five years with a firm of consulting engineers. Evening art and music classes at Toynbee Hall in east London led to a starring role in a Christmas performance and a place to train as an actor at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. Fenton gave up his job, supporting himself by teaching maths at Westminster Polytechnic, and graduated in 1955, winning the Spotlight prize. Acting in repertory theatre at the Sheffield Playhouse, then with other companies, was followed by his big break when Orson Welles auditioned him for his play Chimes at Midnight, featuring Shakespeare’s character Falstaff, and cast him as the thieving Bardolph, one of the knight’s entourage – but voiced in a cockney accent. The production ran in Belfast and Dublin in 1960. Later, Fenton starred as Willie, taciturn husband of Billie Whitelaw’s Winnie, in Samuel Beckett’s Happy Days, directed by the writer at the Royal Court theatre (1979). There were also stints with the Royal Shakespeare Company (1970, 1980-83 and 2008-09), including his final stage role, Vincentio, in The Taming of the Shrew. On television, he had bit parts as police officers, prison warders, taxi drivers, accountants, Jews and Germans, as well as more substantial roles: Friedrich Merz, a member of a wealthy Jewish family in A Legacy (1975), based on Sybille Bedford’s novel set in the decades leading up to the first world war; Corporal “Miff” Moffat in The Fourth Arm (1983), about secret agents parachuted into occupied Europe; and Erich Gottlieb, a baker, in two series (1984-85) of Shine on Harvey Moon, set in the post-second world war East End. As a keen artist painting landscapes in watercolour, he had exhibitions at the National Theatre, when it showcased works by actors, and the Primrose Hill gallery. In 1967, Fenton married the cellist Madeline Thorner. They later separated and he is survived by their three sons, Daniel, Sam and Toby, and daughter, Nina.

2/2/2022,"The author of an acclaimed play about the future of the monarchy has taken on the “Shakespearean” figure of Donald Trump and his battle to regain the White House in 2024 in a new work in blank verse. “I never thought I would go back to writing Shakespearean form again, but then I had an instinct that Trump is like a Shakespearean king, so it felt like a match,” said playwright Mike Bartlett, whose acclaimed King Charles III focused on a power struggle and constitutional crisis following the death of the Queen.  Bertie Carvel, who plays Tony Blair in the next season of The Crown, takes the part of Trump in The 47th, which opens at the Old Vic in March. “For me, he was the obvious choice,” said Bartlett, who previously worked with Carvel on the television drama Dr Foster. The 47th imagines Trump’s bid to win the 2024 US presidential election and his opponents’ efforts to defeat him and rightwing populism. “Can it be defeated? And, on the other hand, what is the appeal of the thing Trump offers – which is clearly huge?” said Bartlett. The play was intended “to interrogate where America is now, and where it’s headed” while entertaining audiences. “One of the appeals of the Shakespearean form is it can move tone between something that’s very witty and very funny, and something that’s deadly serious – and it can do that within a paragraph.” Bartlett added: “It was a joy writing Trump in Shakespearean form. He lends himself to that beautifully, he just writes himself. He’s hilarious, and devastating. And this has opened my eyes to exactly what his rhetorical tactics are, where his wit is, where he’s intelligent, and where he’s not intelligent.” The 47th is directed by Rupert Goold, who also directed the Olivier award-winning King Charles III, which premiered in 2014 and later became a TV film. It too was written in blank verse – also known as unrhymed iambic pentameter – in common with many Shakespeare plays. Richard Goulding, who played Prince Harry in both play and film, said in 2017: “This blank verse form heightens all the exchanges and it makes things much more operatic, much more dramatic, and everything much more significant … It’s all about the rhythms and the way the language is used.” Bartlett said his inspiration for The 47th stemmed from Trump denying the results of the 2020 election, and “seeing that the assaults on the Capitol and feeling the country was headed towards potential civil violence. Suddenly that power struggle is the story.” He added: “I feel like I have the absolute right to do this, given the political power, the sway [these people] have over every single person’s life. This is what theatre should be doing – looking at these figures, looking at what motivates them, asking what can they do, what the future is going to be. “A great play will ask existential questions. What are our ambitions? How good are we? Why are we fascinated by Trump? Do we have a devil in all of us? And does the devil have the best tunes?” Carvel, he said, was “all-in as an actor. He fully embodies the character and he’s totally fearless to present someone on stage that you might not like at all.” Whether Miss Trunchbull in Matilda the Musical, Simon Foster in Dr Foster, or Rupert Murdoch in Ink, “these are not people that are well liked. “He just has a complete pursuit of the truth of the story and the character. And to play Trump, you absolutely want someone that has that intimidation about them that Trump has in real life.”",Arts/Stage,‘Shakespearean’ Donald Trump to be subject of play in blank verse,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/01/shakespearean-donald-trump-to-be-subject-of-play-in-blank-verse
2/2/2022,"A whistleblower has alleged that an executive at NSO Group offered a US-based mobile security company “bags of cash” in exchange for access to a global signalling network used to track individuals through their mobile phone, according to a complaint that was made to the US Department of Justice. The allegation, which dates back to 2017 and was made by a former mobile security executive named Gary Miller, was disclosed to federal authorities and to the US congressman Ted Lieu, who said he conducted his own due diligence on the claim and found it “highly disturbing”.  Details of the allegation by Miller were then sent in a letter by Lieu to the Department of Justice. “The privacy implications to Americans and national security implications to America of NSO Group accessing mobile operator signalling networks are vast and alarming,” Lieu wrote in his letter. The letter was shared with the Guardian and other media partners on the Pegasus project, a media consortium led by the Paris-based Forbidden Stories that has investigated NSO and published a series of stories about how governments around the world have used the company’s spyware to target activists, journalists, and lawyers, among others. NSO said it had no business with the mobile security company. The Guardian and media partners have separately learned that NSO is the subject of an active criminal investigation by the Department of Justice, according to four people familiar with the investigation. The investigation, they claim, is focused on allegations of unauthorised intrusions into networks and mobile devices. One American citizen whose mobile phone was hacked by a client of the spyware maker – and who asked not to be identified – said they were interviewed at length about the 2021 hacking incident by US authorities. Security researchers had found the individual was hacked while living outside the US and using a non-US mobile number. The DoJ also interviewed the Mexican journalist Carmen Aristegui, whose iPhone was hacked using NSO technology, according to security researchers who have analysed her mobile phone. According to another person familiar with the criminal investigation, the DoJ has also been in contact with a company whose users are alleged to have been targeted by clients of NSO using Pegasus spyware. The DoJ declined to comment. NSO has previously said that it does not know how its clients use its spyware, but that the clients are meant to target only serious criminals. It has said its technology has saved “thousands of lives” by thwarting terror attacks. It has also said that it investigates credible allegations of wrongdoing by its clients. NSO has for years been considered among the world’s most sophisticated makers of spyware. When it is successfully deployed, a user of Pegasus can intercept phone calls, read messages on encrypted apps, view photographs, and turn a phone into a remote listening device. The Biden administration announced in November that it was adding NSO to the commerce department’s “entity list” – in effect, an export blacklist – after it said it found evidence that the Israeli company had supplied spyware to foreign governments, which used the tools to “maliciously target” government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics and embassy workers. The allegation at the heart of congressman Ted Lieu’s letter to the DoJ dates back to 2017. In 2017, Gary Miller – the whistleblower who agreed to be interviewed by the Guardian, the Washington Post, and Forbidden Stories – was working for a company called Mobileum, which designed, developed and sold software to protect the decades-old SS7 network, a global messaging system used for legitimate purposes by mobile phone companies, but can also be used to track mobile users’ physical location. Miller was asked to lead a web voice call that he alleged in records provided to authorities was attended by NSO executives Shalev Hulio and Omri Lavie, two of the group’s co-founders. NSO, Miller said, was interested in learning more about Mobileum’s access to hundreds of mobile networks around the world. Specifically, Miller has alleged the NSO executives wanted to discuss how gaining access to the mobile networks would allow NSO to “enhance the capabilities of their surveillance software”. “They stated explicitly that their product was designed for surveillance and it was designed to surveil not the good guys but the bad guys,” Miller said. He added: “They stated multiple times that their work was authorised by government agencies. They didn’t get in the details of who those government agencies were.” As the meeting progressed, Miller alleged, a member of his own company’s leadership at Mobileum asked what NSO believed the “business model” was of working with Mobileum, since Mobileum did not sell access to the global signalling networks as a product. According to Miller, and a written disclosure he later made to federal authorities, the response allegedly made by Lavie was “we drop bags of cash at your office”. Miller said the meeting ended soon thereafter. A few months later, Miller said he submitted an anonymous “tip” to the FBI in which he reported some details of the August conversation but did not hear back from authorities. In a statement to the Guardian, Lavie’s spokesperson said: “No business was undertaken with Mobileum. Mr Lavie has no recollection of using the phrase ‘bags of cash’, and believes he did not do so. However, if those words were used they will have been entirely in jest.” A representative for Lavie also said in an email to the Guardian that Lavie “strongly denies having suggested any action that was unethical or illegal”. An NSO spokesperson said in a statement to the Guardian: “The company [has] never done any business with this company. We are not aware of any DoJ investigation. In addition, NSO does not do business using cash as a form of payment. Any suggestion otherwise demonstrates a profound lack of understanding about our company.” Hulio did not respond to a request for comment. Miller has since left Mobileum and is being represented by attorney John Tye at Whistleblower Aid. Miller is currently working as a mobile security researcher at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto. He filed his whistleblower complaint to authorities at the DoJ, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission in June 2021. He then shared his account with Lieu in December 2021. There is no evidence that Mobileum ever engaged in another meeting with NSO or gave the company access to any mobile networks. Eran Gorev, who at the time was a managing partner at Francisco Partners, a US-based investment company that had an interest in NSO in August 2017, and is listed in Miller’s disclosures to authorities as having attended the meeting, said in a statement to the Guardian that he had not been involved in NSO for more than three years and had “no recollection” of ever meeting with or speaking with Mobileum. He said if such a meeting did take place, he would “absolutely never make a comment like this” and that if someone else did, “it would “clearly have been made in jest and a colloquial expression/cultural misunderstanding”. Gorev also said that during the time he was “involved” with NSO, the company complied with all applicable laws with “strict oversight by the Israeli government” and had instituted a business ethics committee. Asked about the details of the meeting, Mobileum said in a statement shared with the Pegasus project: “Mobileum does not have – and has never had – any business relationship with NSO Group.” It added: “Mobileum takes the data privacy of its customers information very seriously and has implemented a robust cybersecurity program to prevent any breaches. Mobileum does not have any direct access to the customer’s network and is unable to provide any kind of access, including SS7 access, to any third party.” There is no evidence that the DoJ is actively investigating Miller’s allegations. In an interview with the Pegasus project, Lieu, a former prosecutor, said: “It just looks really fishy, and it doesn’t smell right, which is why I wanted the justice department to investigate.” NSO declined to comment on Lieu’s remark.",News/News,"NSO offered US mobile security firm ‘bags of cash’, whistleblower claims",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/01/nso-offered-us-mobile-security-firm-bags-of-cash-whistleblower-claims

2/2/2022,"Late-night hosts responded to a shocking if not surprising admission from Donald Trump this weekend, with a Sunday night statement that said the quiet part out loud: that Vice-President Mike Pence could have overturned the election.  “One thing you can always count on with Trump is that eventually he’ll tire himself out and just confess,” said Seth Meyers on Late Night. “He can’t help it. He just blurts it out. He did it with collusion, he did it with Ukraine, and that’s exactly what he did over the weekend with a statement in which he admitted he wanted his vice-president, Mike Pence, to overturn the election.” In the statement, Trump claimed “fraud and many other irregularities” in the 2020 election (no such fraud has been found) and asked: “How come the Democrats and … Republicans, like Wacky Susan Collins, are desperately trying to pass legislation that will not allow the vice-president to change the results of the election? “Actually, what they are saying, is that Mike Pence did have the right to change the outcome, and they now want to take that right away. Unfortunately, he didn’t exercise that power. He could have overturned the election!” “There’s no crime Trump could commit that he wouldn’t later confess to,” said Meyers. “He’d just exhaust all the excuses until he says, screw it, I’m guilty, baby! If it had been him instead of OJ, the quote would’ve been: ‘The gloves don’t fit, but you don’t need gloves to stab a guy.’” Trump also promised at a rally in Texas on Saturday to pardon those charged with seditious conspiracy for their role in the 6 January attack on the Capitol. “At some point you just have to admit this is a pro-insurrection movement,” Meyers argued. “If you’re at a party, and someone starts doing cocaine and someone else says, ‘hey, can I get some of that cocaine?’ and then someone else says, ‘hey, I went to the bank on the way here to get new hundred dollar bills to snort that cocaine with,’ you might turn to your spouse and say, ‘I think we’re at a cocaine party.’” On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert acknowledged the retirement of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady after 22 seasons and seven Super Bowl titles. “So bad news for your dad: there’s a new retiree about to dominate the pickleball league,” Colbert joked. The 44-year-old QB accomplished more than any other quarterback in the history of the NFL, even though he was drafted 199th overall. “Which just goes to show you that anyone can be successful as long as you’re one of the most gifted and attractive people in human history,” Colbert noted. “Now that Brady appears to be hanging up the old football skates, the world may finally see what we’ve all longed for: Dad Bod Brady,” he added. “Do it! Give us hope, Tom!” In other news, “while the January 6 select committee continues to look for the cause of the Capitol riot, the cause admitted to everything and threatened to do it again,” Colbert said, referencing Trump’s rally in Texas this weekend, in which pledged to “treat those people from January 6 fairly” and promised pardons. “Well, as long as you’re doling out pardons, fuck you,” Colbert retorted. Trump’s followers will seemingly do anything for him. Now he’s making a bold offer to return the favor. pic.twitter.com/Kpm1AxbGzZ Donald Trump is “basically the ex that America kicked out for throwing an open-house party at the Capitol”, said Trevor Noah on The Daily Show. “And like many exes, he really wants a second chance. But instead of promising to do better next time, he’s threatening to do even worse.” Noah played clips from Trump’s weekend rally, in which he continued to spread his myths about the “stolen” 2020 election and promised to pardon those who led the 6 January attack on the Capitol. “When you think about it, it’s really smart what he’s saying,” said Noah. “Because he could’ve pardoned all of his people when January 6 happened. You realize that, right? He was the president. But he didn’t pardon them. He let them get prosecuted, and now they’re all going to jail. He let this happen! But now that his ass is on the line, now he’s like ‘man, if I was president, I’d have never let this happen to you.’ “Trump leans on his supporters really hard,” he continued. “I mean, first they had to storm the Capitol because he lost the election. Then their donations went to his legal fees, because he’s always getting sued. Now they have to protest if he gets charged? Where does it end? If Trump does go to prison, is he going to make these poor people smuggle cigarettes up their butt?”",Arts/Culture,Seth Meyers on Trump rally: ‘At some point you just have to admit this is a pro-insurrection movement’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/01/seth-meyers-trump-stephen-colbert-trevor-noah
2/2/2022,"Inspectors from the Food Standards Agency are to check on school lunches in England to make sure they meet national standards, as part of government plans to tackle obesity within its levelling up white paper to be published on Wednesday. The white paper is also expected to include a new push to teach students about healthy eating and food preparation, with all students expected to leave school knowing how to prepare and cook at least six basic recipes, as well as adopting measures championed by the celebrity chef Jamie Oliver.  The move comes amid fears that schools in some parts of the country are struggling to meet the national school food standards that have been in place since 2015, such as including no more than two portions of deep-fried food in school lunches each week. There is also evidence that childhood obesity increased markedly during the Covid pandemic, which saw physical education, school sports and other activities for children cancelled or restricted. “Obesity has got worse because of Covid. This has been especially bad in the most deprived areas. Many of our most deprived children are carrying a lockdown legacy around their waists, which is affecting their life chances,” a Whitehall source said. “No one has got this wrong deliberately but we need to make it a lot easier for everyone who is involved with feeding our kids.” A pilot scheme to be announced in the white paper will mean the agency starts inspecting food offered by schools in a small number of local authorities later this year. The aim is to improve ways to help schools comply with the existing standards. There will also be new funding to train secondary school teachers in cooking and food preparation, with £5m over three years to give training to a teacher from every state secondary and create courses. The government wants every child to leave school knowing how to cook six recipes. The white paper also adopted a policy promoted by Oliver and Bite Back 2030, the charity the chef co-founded to lobby to improve food for young people. Last month, Oliver and the leaders of 600 state schools called for each school to publish annual food reports showing what progress it had made in meeting standards on health and nutrition. According to the white paper, the reporting of schools food arrangements will initially be voluntary but the intention is for it become mandatory. School governors are also to be given extra training on their responsibilities to improve food standards. A recent report by Bite Back highlighted the different lunch choices offered at schools across the country, with pupils on free school meals reporting they were given fewer choices. But the white paper is not thought to improve funding for children receiving free school meals, which includes all infants up to year two. The government pays £2.34 for each child’s food a day, only slightly more than it did a decade ago despite rising prices.",News/Education,Food agency to check school lunches in England meet standards,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/01/food-agency-to-check-school-lunches-in-england-meet-standards

His mum’s records of life and love in postwar Melbourne gave the comedian plenty to work with, especially when contrasted with his dad’s retirement journals – which document the tragedy that eventually brought their relationship to an end.  As well as being great material, his mum’s diaries are unsurprisingly a cherished sentimental object for Callinan. Here, he tells us why he’d rush to save those pages in a fire, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. On the night of my dad’s funeral a few years ago, we were going through his things and I found a small notebook none of us had ever seen before. It was mum’s diary from 1946. I began reading it aloud to my siblings and the 19-year-old version of mum came back to life. The diary is a time capsule of life in Melbourne after the second world war as she balanced her social life with weekly visits to read to wounded servicemen at Heidelberg Military hospital. The diary is the focus of my Melbourne international comedy festival show. However, the journal is not all chocolates and roses. It turns out she was also a member of a Catholic cult. They wore blue cloaks, tattooed rosary beads around their necks and sacrificed the weakest altar boy on Ash Wednesday – though I haven’t cross-referenced my sources on those last couple yet. Like many music collectors, I was quickly seduced by the economy of scale of the CD in the 90s. My sizeable vinyl collection gathered dust in a friend’s garage while I tested the integrity of my lounge room wall by adding yet another Ikea CD tower to my row of skyscrapers. I didn’t know how much I missed the ritual of putting on a record until my wife, Zillah, bought me a vintage Pye Stereogram. It is easily the best thing I’ve ever been given. Apart from looking like it’s been taken from the studio set of The Mod Squad, the sound is incredible, and it’s even got a ‘loud’ button. I’m pleased to say I am now happily reunited with my estranged vinyl family and it continues to grow and grow. I play a record at least once a day and none of us talk about the CDs packed away in boxes in my friend’s garage. From the age of seven, I obsessively collected footy cards. Such was the level of my addiction that I used to take my lunch money out of the paper bag and buy a packet of cards on the way home. I was essentially living on a daily diet of a single pink strip of Scanlens gum. My nanna supported my habit by giving me her valuable collection of vintage cigarette and liquorice sporting cards. Chicken Smallhorn and Gordon Coventry now lay face to face with Bernie Quinlan and Twiggy Dunne. Despite the sentimental (and actual) value of the collection, I just kept in an old box under my bed. In my university years when I was still living at home, my nephews often used to play with the cards. One day I was overcome with a sense of dread and checked that the box was still there. It wasn’t. Apparently one morning in my hungover state, I had said yes when they asked if they could have them. By the time I got to my brother’s place to get them back, they had already taken them to school and swapped them for a racing car set. It’s a pity I had to cut them out of my life; they were lovely kids.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Three things with Damian Callinan: ‘Mum’s diary is not all chocolate and roses’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/02/three-things-with-damian-callinan-mums-diary-is-not-all-chocolate-and-roses
2/2/2022,"Midway through the last season of Married at First Sight Australia, Bryce Ruthven’s fate as one of reality TV’s most loathed “villains” was sealed. Tasked by producers with ranking every female participant in order of attractiveness, he placed his bride, Melissa Rawson, in fourth position while sitting next to her. “I know you were probably hoping you’re number one … but you know that I can’t lie,” he told the visibly upset Melissa. “I think if I put you at number one, you’d be able to tell that [I’m lying].” The program, which returned for its ninth season in Australia on Monday night, matches complete strangers who meet for the first time at the altar. This scene was a particularly low moment in the series for Bryce, who had already been accused by viewers of appearing to gaslight and manipulate Melissa. But moments like this are part of what has helped make MAFS, as it has become known, a spectacularly successful reality phenomenon.  Abroad, everyone from Promising Young Woman director Emerald Fennell to musician Sam Smith have sung praises for the Australian version of the show; in Australia, the most recent season finale drew 1.398 million viewers – even more than Meghan and Harry’s explosive Oprah Winfrey interview. One of them was writer Clementine Ford, who has mixed feelings about the show’s return. “How can you love something that you hate so much? Yes, I’m a huge MAFS fan,” she tells Guardian Australia. Or, rather: “I wouldn’t say that I’m a fan of MAFS the show. But I am a fan of the extreme emotions that MAFS makes me feel week after week.” The “marriages” that begin the season aren’t legally binding, but over the weeks that follow we watch the relationships develop into something real, or, more often, spectacularly crash and burn. To help stoke the embers of marital discord, couples are subjected to tests – like being asked to rank their partner’s appearance. Ford has regularly spoken out on social media about the often-toxic relationship dynamics that feature on MAFS – but it’s too complex, she says, for a simple condemnation. Referring to how Bryce appeared to treat Melissa in the series, Ford says: “I think is a really, really damaging thing for people to see play out on screen. On the other hand, it’s kind of helpful to be able to talk about those patterns.” Tara Washington, the executive producer of Australia’s Married at First Sight, knows that what viewers saw of Bryce and Melissa’s relationship in the series “wasn’t everybody’s cup of tea”. “We’re not there trying to encourage that kind of behaviour in a relationship, we’re there to document it,” Washington says. “But what I like about MAFS is that it starts the conversation with people about your own experiences, about what you think is wrong or right, and acceptable or not. I think the Bryce and Melissa relationship certainly did that.” “But I want to be really clear – if we think that somebody is unsafe, or in harm’s way, or at risk of being in harm’s way, we would intervene. We wouldn’t allow that to happen for the sake of a good storyline,” she adds. Bryce and Melissa – along with other couples from previous seasons – have disputed how their relationship came across in the show, attributing it to editing. “They have to have a villain and for some reason I got picked out,” Ruthven said recently. Washington believes that the “unpredictability” of the relationships on the show is what keeps people tuning in. “We’ve often compared it to a telenovela, in that it’s very addictive viewing,” she says. Last year, MAFS got a new audience hooked: the show became a surprise lockdown hit in the UK, pulling in 1.57 million viewers an episode at its peak. While the UK has its own MAFs, it’s Australia’s version that Britons have fallen for – perhaps thanks to the extra havoc, scandal and sex it packs in. There have been affairs, physical altercations, wine tipped over heads; last season, in an act of revenge, one husband used his wife’s toothbrush to clean faeces off their toilet. “It’s a bit of a mystery, in some ways, as to why people are so open and honest on such a public platform, but we’re very grateful they are,” Washington says. But MAFS hasn’t always been quite this messy. In its first four seasons, the show’s format was different: it featured fewer couples, the cast lived separately, and the weekly dinner party and commitment ceremony episodes, which regularly create explosive conflict, did not exist. But when Washington took over in season five, Channel Nine gave MAFS four episodes a week, and the show became a hit. That seasonwas the point, Ford says, was when MAFS changed from being a show that “genuinely explored the psychological growth and love between two people” into “the absolute unrepentant garbage fire that we know and love-hate it as today”. “They had some really toxic personalities on it [in season five]. That sucked me in – so well done, Tara, one of the most diabolically genius producers ever to have existed,” she laughs. The show has only become more salacious since season five, which Ford believes is due in part to its notoriety. As it has become more popular, more participants have signed up for what some people call “the wrong reasons” – reality TV parlance for those looking to get famous, rather than finding a soulmate. And the “science” the show’s producers claim determine their couples hasn’t often worked. Of the 71 couples the show has matched, only five remain together today. Bryce and Melissa are actually one of the few success stories: the pair are now engaged and recently welcomed twin boys. Washington insists that, despite perceptions, producers try to cast those genuinely looking for love: “We understand that’s not the only motivation [for going on MAFS] … but I think you’d be hard pressed to find someone who is single that doesn’t actually want to meet someone great.” But while meeting someone is one thing, Ford believes that insisting the contestants “try and make it work at all costs” could be a damaging message for viewers – particularly women. “Reality television should be seen as a diversion, not as a guide,” she says. “Generally speaking, any kind of narrative that enforces this idea that partnership leads to happiness and singledom leads to despair is really toxic and fucked up. And the idea that women are better off being with anyone, no matter how unfulfilling it is … that’s really messed up. I think that women should be taking away the message that oftentimes it’s better to be single.” Of course, that doesn’t mean she won’t tune in. “Every year, I’m like, I’m not gonna watch it. This is trash,” Ford says. “And every year I watch it.” The ninth season of Married at First Sight is airing now on Channel Nine in Australia.

2/2/2022,"Australians overwhelmingly support a pathway to permanent residency for migrants on temporary visas who have lived and worked in Australia for several years, new research shows. An independent survey found 78% of Australians believe migrants already living and working in Australia should have a pathway to permanent residency.  The survey, commissioned by the Human Rights Law Centre, found that a majority of people believe migrants help fill skills shortages for particular jobs (58%) and bring cultural diversity to Australia (54%). One-third (33%) believe migrants work in lower-paid jobs that Australian citizens wouldn’t want to do, and nearly a quarter (24%) believe migrants counteract Australia’s ageing population. A majority of respondents (55%) agreed with the statement: “migrants should have stability to plan for their future here no matter what type of visa they hold”. A minority (26%) said migrants should only be allowed to stay in the country “for as long as an employer wants them”. The survey, conducted by Essential, interviewed 1,095 Australian residents in December. David Burke, legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said every person should have the opportunity to plan their life with some security. “But the federal government’s visa system is keeping people in limbo and often unable to reunite with their family even when they have lived and worked here for years. “These results show that people clearly recognise the injustice of policies that are leaving their neighbours, colleagues and friends stuck in uncertainty simply because of the visa they hold.” Burke said the disruption caused to Australia’s migration program caused by the pandemic has given Australia the opportunity to reset its approach to immigration. “Our political leaders should take steps to ensure this system reflects the values of the community by allowing migrants and refugees living in Australia to have a stable future.” Australia’s migration system was significantly reformed in the second half of the 1990s to prioritise skilled migration over family reunification, and to emphasise temporary migration to Australia. While the number of temporary visas granted has grown massively – particularly driven by an increase in international students – the number of permanent places has not grown proportionately. The “two-step” model of Australian migration – a temporary visa being converted to permanent residency – has broken down for many temporary migrants unable to find a pathway to permanency. The Covid-19 travel restrictions have dramatically reduced all forms of migration over the past two years. A report from the Migrant Workers Centre in November argued the growth of temporary migration visas had turned Australia into a “guest worker state”, and created an underclass of young, vulnerable and often exploited migrant employees. The report found nearly two-thirds (65%) of temporary visa holders had experienced wage theft. The absence of a lack of a pathway to permanent settlement exacerbated vulnerabilities: 91% of those workers who experienced wage theft had no pathway to permanent residency. “Australia’s migration regime has lost balance. The government issues an unlimited number of temporary visas while tightly controlling the number of permanent visas issued. As a result, most migrant workers are forced to hop from one temporary visa to another until exhaustion.” The chief executive of the Migrant Workers Centre, Matt Kunkel, told the Guardian “unless you’ve navigated Australia’s visa system, it’s hard to understand the huge psychological toll being ‘permanently temporary’ can cause”. “We know from our research that migrants who have a pathway to permanency are less likely to be mistreated at work and that’s a good thing for all workers in Australia.” The issues faced by temporary visa holders have been consistently identified by government agencies. The government’s productivity commission identified in 2016 that the pathway from temporary visas to permanency was “problematic”, noting that “temporary immigrants face a higher risk of being exploited by their employers than the general workforce”. The ACTU told the productivity commission “employer-sponsored visas where workers are dependent on their employer for their ongoing visa status increase the risk for exploitation as workers are less prepared to speak out if they are underpaid, denied their entitlements, or otherwise treated poorly”. The Australian Bureau of Statistics, in the same year, noted there was a threefold increase in the number of people who had arrived on a temporary visa and remained on a temporary visa eight years later, compared with the same survey from November 2013.",News/World news,Australians found to overwhelmingly support path to permanent residency for migrants on temporary visas,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/australians-found-to-overwhelmingly-support-path-to-permanent-residency-for-migrants-on-temporary-visas
2/2/2022,"Queensland authorities abandoned their own contingency plans to protect vulnerable disability housing residents in the event of a Covid outbreak, instead telling accommodation providers to manage positive cases themselves and just “do what you reasonably can”. Emails obtained by Guardian Australia reveal the extent to which Queensland’s health system planning quickly became overburdened by the Omicron outbreak.  Last year, the Queensland government developed a “rapid response” plan for any potential Covid outbreaks in disability residential services, which recognised “critical risks” for residents and the need to isolate any suspected case in consultation with public health officials. But on 26 January, when a disability housing provider contacted the Queensland Metro South public health unit seeking urgent assistance to relocate a positive Covid case who could not effectively isolate at the facility, they were told they would have to manage alone. “Unfortunately, the rise of Omicron means that the opportunities for ideal responses have passed, and we must all just do the best we can,” the response from a public health physician read. “I appreciate that as an organisation, you have been aware of the risk of Covid spreading within your facility, and have raised your concerns with various government bodies. “As discussed, future cases that arise will need to be managed onsite. There is limited capacity for Covid-19 cases in acute hospitals, and admission is based on clinical need. Isolation hotels are unable to accommodate people with complex needs, limiting their effectiveness for your client group. “The best advice I can provide is to do what you reasonably can.” The government’s original rapid response plan said it was “identified as being necessary given the congregate living arrangements and co-morbidities identified as being critical risks for residents living in residential services”. It identified the need to work alongside state public health units to implement infection control. The formal advice changed on 28 January, noting that where isolation was not possible facilities should “do what is within your capacity to minimise the risk of transmission”. Currently, when cases are detected, accommodation providers say phone calls to state public health units often go unanswered. It can take several days before they even receive an email response. The Supported Accommodation Providers Association represents the “unfunded” disability accommodation sector, which plugs a gap in the system for people, mostly with psychosocial disabilities or complex mental health conditions, who would likely otherwise end up homeless. Nathan Johnson, a spokesperson for Sapa, said in many cases they were homes “of last resort”. In many of the facilities, there is limited ability to isolate. Residents share bedrooms, bathrooms and common areas. Those who smoke often share cigarettes. Johnson said the sector was “in crisis” and that facilities have been unable to obtain enough rapid antigen tests or protective equipment. A staff member at one facility said they had attempted, unsuccessfully, to find alternate accommodation for six separate Covid cases. Each time the resident was rejected for admission to a government-run medi-hotel. “Effectively our residents are falling through the cracks,” he said. “They’re not aged care, they’re not classed as homeless, so they don’t meet the criteria (to go into a medi-hotel). “The most upsetting thing is seeing how other industries are being catered to and we can’t get our emails answered. None of the things we were told would get done have come to fruition.” Another staff member at a disability housing complex told Guardian Australia they had been attempting to routinely test residents for Covid three times a week. She said the Queensland government’s Metro North public health unit advised her to stop screening and only test residents or staff who were symptomatic. “Given our cohort, it’s difficult to ascertain whether they are symptomatic,” the staff member said. Paige Armstrong, the chief executive of the Queenslanders with Disability Network, said lives were at risk because governments had given “a total lack of priority” to the needs of people with disabilities. Armstrong said people with disabilities and their families should be formally recognised as a priority cohort – similar to the aged care sector – to help access supplies, services, and support. Having tried unsuccessfully to elevate concerns for more than two weeks, Johnson said he had a “productive” meeting on Tuesday with staff of Leeanne Enoch, the state communities and housing minister. The Queensland health minister, Yvette D’ath, has previously acknowledged that Covid outbreaks had placed pressure on the health system on top of existing demand. Queensland Health said in a statement: “Queenslanders can be assured everyone who attends a Queensland Health facility will be treated, and we will prioritise those requiring the most urgent care first. “We have been responding to the pandemic for nearly two years and, thanks to good planning, our public health system is sufficiently resourced to manage current demand despite the pressure Covid-19 is placing on our hospitals. “We will continue to monitor our response to Covid-19 and adjust accordingly to ensure we can continue to deliver effective healthcare to Queenslanders.”",News/Australia news,‘Do what you reasonably can’: Queensland disability homes told to manage Covid alone,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/02/do-what-you-reasonably-can-queensland-disability-homes-told-to-manage-covid-alone
2/2/2022,"New South Wales is promising to build more than 1,000 charging stations for electric vehicles under a four-year plan that would create the most extensive EV network in the country. Wednesday’s announcement comes after data was released showing sales of new EVs in Australia tripled in the past 12 months with more than 20,000 drivers in the country choosing the low emissions option in 2021.  The NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, said on Wednesday the government was initially offering $35m to fund up to 50% of the capital costs for businesses to construct fast and ultra-fast charging bays along key travel routes. “This is expected to unlock around $160m in private investment under our plan to build the biggest electric vehicle charging network in Australia,” Kean said. “Construction is expected to start in the second half of 2022 with construction of all charging stations approved in this first round to be completed within two years. Drivers can put range anxiety in the rearview mirror.” The state government flagged the program would likely be repeated over the next four years to construct more than 1,000 fast and ultra-fast chargers state-wide. Ultra-fast chargers can take as little as 15 minutes to provide charge for 400km. The total charging infrastructure program was expected to cost $171m over four years, Kean said. Applications for co-funding will be assessed over two stages, with the first stage assessing eligibility and high-level merit criteria, and a more detailed application for charging sites required in the second stage. “EVs will play a critical role in halving our emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Investments in renewable generation and charging infrastructure will also help our economy recover from the Covid-19 pandemic,” Kean said. First stage applications are due to be finalised in April with successful bidders and sites announced in mid-2022. Data from the Electric Vehicle Council this week suggests incentives introduced by state governments have created slow but growing demand in the EV market in Australia. In 2021, Australia recorded 20,665 EV sales, up from 6,900 in 2020, with sales growing to 1.95% of new vehicle purchases. With many price tags still sitting around $100,000, cost remains a key barrier for many people, but it is expected to fall to match the price of internal combustion engine cars within a decade. At that point, it is predicted EVs will dominate the market. On Monday, the EVC chief executive, Behyad Jafari, told Guardian Australia that this year’s sales figures had represented a milestone. “We’ve been waiting for quite a few years to hit the 1% mark, so to skip that and go straight to 2% is a big deal,” Jafari said. While the bump in sales was very welcome, Jafari said the country could be a world leader in EV take-up with federal government support. “There’s no reason why we shouldn’t be up to 20% already,” Jafari said. “We have a federal government talking about hitting those targets by 2030 when really we could be there today. It’s just a matter of them doing their jobs.”",News/Environment,"NSW to co-fund 1,000 electric vehicle charging stations across the state over four years",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/02/nsw-to-co-fund-1000-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-across-the-state-over-four-years
2/2/2022,"It is now clear that it is possible to catch Covid more than once, including strains you have previously been infected with. It is also known that being infected with Covid-19 boosts your protection from reinfection. What is less clear is how long that extra protection against the same strain lasts – and whether it is as effective against other strains.  A small laboratory study published in December suggests one reason Omicron is replacing Delta is that being infected with Omicron offers a high level of protection against Delta, while the reverse is not true. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the Covid-19 technical lead with the World Health Organization’s health emergencies program, said another reason for a sharp increase in Omicron cases in recent weeks was its potential for “immune escape”. “This means people can be reinfected either if they had a previous infection, or if they’ve been vaccinated,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Now you have to remember, vaccines are incredibly effective at preventing severe disease and death, but they don’t prevent all infections and they don’t prevent all onward transmission. So it is still absolutely critical to get vaccinated because it will save your life, but it doesn’t prevent all infections or transmission.” Kirby Institute virologist Associate Prof Stuart Turville said Omicron has only been around a couple of months so it was too early to estimate the risk of reinfection or how long any protection from an infection lasts. “We can only base our answer on what we have observed in previous variants,” he said. “Several large studies from Qatar have looked at reinfections.” A recent preprint from Qatar states: “Protection afforded by prior infection in preventing symptomatic reinfection with Alpha, Beta, or Delta is robust, at about 90%.” “While such protection against reinfection with Omicron is lower, it is still considerable at nearly 60%,” the paper found. “Prior-infection protection against hospitalisation or death at reinfection appears robust, regardless of variant.” How long this protection lasts is unclear and depends on factors including the number of vaccinations, whether you’re immune-suppressed, and the length of time since vaccination. Turville said a complicating factor to immune response is the severity of any Covid-19 infection. His research team are examining people infected with Delta in 2020 to see how their antibodies hold-up post-vaccination. “If you were infected in 2020 and then vaccinated with two doses of either AstraZeneca or Pfizer, your response is very similar to three doses of Pfizer,” he said. “But that’s assuming you have a decent response to the virus initially. If you have had an initial low response to the virus, your response will be driven more by the vaccine dose. As a broad-brush stroke, if you had a mild case of Covid in 2020, your response will be relatively low. If you had a case that made you very sick, so high disease severity, you will have had a better response. There is no need to delay vaccination. Health guidelines state you can get a booster once you have fully recovered from the virus, which for most people is four-to-six weeks after infection. In the short-term boosters can further strengthen your protection up to 86% against reinfection and 98% against serious illness, NSW Health states. The independent expert advisory group on vaccination, Atagi, says the same thing, and that “previous infection is not a contraindication to vaccination … vaccination can occur following recovery of acute illness from Covid-19”.

Atagi decreased the timeframe “due to the increased risk of re-infection with the Omicron variant, particularly for those who had a Delta variant infection in 2021,” the guidelines state. Turville said viewing Omicron as a “natural booster” making a third vaccine dose unnecessary was unwise. “That exercise is an uncontrolled experiment where you will have no control of the dosage, or in other words the level of viral infection, and thus the outcome,” he said. “Vaccination is a set dosage that is safe with a predictable response in most people.” “It is a great question but one we will likely only know in the next few months,” Turville said. “In brief, we do not know as the numbers of people in that setting are on the low side and it will take a while to study in cohorts where people have volunteered for researchers to follow their response. The other issue is this will change with future variants.” The advice is similar in each state and territory. In Victoria, if a recently recovered Covid-19 case becomes a close contact of a confirmed case, they do not need to quarantine again if the re-exposure was less than 30 days since the recovered case’s onset of symptoms, or since their first positive test if they had no symptoms. In the ACT, if you are identified as a household or high-risk close contact, or a moderate risk casual contact within four weeks of your clearance from isolation, you do not need to isolate again. The ACT advice states if you have recovered from Covid while there is still someone in your household who has it, you can leave the house, but must separate from other people with Covid-19 in the household as much as possible and observe hand hygiene, mask wearing and social distancing as per public health advice. Queensland Health advice states that you are not a close contact if you have had Covid-19 in the past four weeks. It is best to check with your state or territory health department if you are unsure, and for definitions of “close contact”, which have changed over time.",News/Australia news,Post-Covid protection: what happens after you get the virus?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/02/post-covid-protection-what-happens-after-you-get-the-virus
2/2/2022,"Australians are waiting 60% longer than usual for their passport applications to be processed, as the reopening of the international border drives a huge jump in demand and a flood of calls to the passport office. Guardian Australia can reveal the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has issued more than 275,000 new passports since 1 November – almost triple the number issued compared with the same period a year ago.  “Due to the increased demand [following the reopening of the international border] passports are currently taking longer to process,” a spokesperson for Dfat said. “At present, processing times are, on average, around 16 business days, compared to within 10 business days previously.” The spokesperson said this processing time was “well short of the timeframe the public are encouraged to renew their passport” – up to six weeks ahead of their planned international travel. Australians have complained of long waits when phoning the passport office, or even having their calls disconnected, even as Dfat attempted to manage demand by hiring an extra 130 staff. Several users contacted Dfat on social media to say they had applied for passports more than two months ago and had not yet received them – but in some cases the call centre was too busy to accept calls. Dfat’s Twitter account has been replying to complaints about being unable to reach the call centre by providing an email address for the passport office. It is understood Dfat has recruited 130 additional new staff, as well as returning large numbers of passport staff who had been on temporary redeployment to other roles while passport demand was low. This move is believed to have bolstered the number of staff currently undertaking passport-related work to more than 600, which is similar to pre-pandemic staffing levels. More staff are expected to be recruited between now and 2023 amid expectations of further increases in international travel. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Dfat spokesperson said the number of passport applications currently in progress – 80,000 – was about 30,000 above pre-pandemic levels. “Dfat expects this to return to previous levels by February.” Early in the pandemic, Guardian Australia reported that the disruption to overseas travel had resulted in a massive drop in Australian passport applications, a decline of about 400,000 in the first half of 2020. That also meant the government missed out on tens of millions of dollars in application fee revenue. Over the past 12 months, it is estimated about 1.8 million Australians have either put off renewing their expired passports or applying for a passport for the first time. The latter category includes new Australian citizens. But the surge in applications has been driven by the progressive reopening of the international border, which began when the government allowed fully vaccinated Australian citizens and permanent residents to freely travel abroad from 1 November. Officials at the Australian Passport Office (APO) had anticipated a need to prepare for a “spike in applications”. In an operational briefing to the new Dfat secretary, Kathryn Campbell, in July 2021, departmental officials said: “A key challenge for the APO is lower passport demand, which will likely continue for the remainder of 2021.” The briefing document – obtained under freedom of information laws – said the APO “has a well-developed plan in place aimed at bringing forward some of this pent-up demand and managing a future spike in applications when travel restrictions ease”. It is understood this plan included sending out email and SMS messages to more than 2.2 million Australians over the past year to remind them that their passport has either expired or is about to expire. The department has also been in touch with travel and tourism industry firms to enlist their help in urging customers to renew their passports early.",News/Australia news,Australians face 60% longer wait for passports as border reopening spikes demand ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/02/australians-face-60-longer-wait-for-passports-as-border-reopening-spikes-demand
2/2/2022,"Fossil fuel companies backing large gas projects across Australia gave nearly $1m in political donations to the three major parties last financial year. The analysis comes from campaign group 350.org which examined donations records from the Australian Electoral Commission to identify how much oil and gas companies were giving to Labor, the Liberals and the Nationals.  Australia has more than 100 fossil fuel developments in the pipeline that could result in nearly 1.7bn tonnes of greenhouse gases a year – equivalent to about 5% of global industrial emissions – if all were to go ahead. Combined the total amount donated by eight oil and gas companies or their lobby groups amounted to $959,115. Broken down between the parties, the lion’s share of this money went to the Liberal party, which received $506,810. Next was Labor, which received $392,354, and last was the Nationals, which received $59,991. The Greens were not included as the party has a policy of refusing donations from fossil fuel companies and received none. By far the biggest donor was Woodside Energy, which announced last year it was pushing ahead with its $16bn project to open up the Scarborough gas field, and gave $124,000 to the Coalition and $108,350 to Labor, making for a total of $232,250. The next biggest donors were the Minerals Council of Australia, which gave $193,943 ($101,192 to the Liberals, $28,091 to the Nationals and $64,660 to Labor), and the trust for “coal baron” Trevor St Baker, which donated $165,202. Of this, $112,758 went to the Liberal party and $52,444 to Labor. In many cases, the amounts donated skewed towards the Liberal party with groups like the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea) giving the Liberal party $72,610 compared to $31,650 for Labor.

Santos, which is pursuing the $3.6bn Narrabri gas project, donated $44,000 to the Labor party but nothing to the Liberals. Meanwhile, Empire Energy Group, a gas company with strong links to the Coalition that is working to frack the Beetaloo Basin, gave $40,000 to the Liberal party and $25,000 to Labor. Shani Tager, the senior campaign manager at 350, said it was clear fossil fuel companies attempting to develop projects facing significant community opposition were attempting to buy political support. “It’s companies that have high-profile projects that have a really strong pushback against them that are making these donations to shore up political support,” Tager said. With “more money than ever” being donated by fossil fuel companies, Tager said political donations from the oil and gas sector should be banned over the risk it may influence policymaking in a way that stops action on climate change. “The Morrison government has been really, vocally supportive of the gas industry and in addition to being supportive, they have really put their money where their mouth is, they give money to these groups,” Taber said. “This money is buying what these companies want, and that is more subsidies and special conditions for their projects going ahead.” The federal minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, and the Labor shadow ministers, Ed Husic and Chris Bowen, were contacted for comment. Last year the International Energy Agency said limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal set out in the Paris agreement, meant exploration and exploitation of new fossil fuel basins had to stop in 2021.",News/Australia news,‘More money than ever’: gas companies made almost $1m in donations to Labor and Liberals,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/02/more-money-than-ever-gas-companies-made-almost-1m-in-donations-to-labor-and-liberals
