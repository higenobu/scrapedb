1/17/2022,"Two sports announcers were fired on earlier this week after disparaging high school girls. Jim Carter and Steve Shaw criticized girls on two basketball teams for their weight. They talked about finding ""uniforms that fit the girls"" on an apparent hot mic, local news outlets reported. A Maine radio station based fired two sports announcers for body-shaming high school girls during a livestream of their basketball game. WHOU-FM fired Jim Carter and Steve Shaw on Thursday after receiving complaints from parents about the comments the two made regarding the teen girls' weight, the Portland Press-Herald reported. The two announcers had been watching a livestream of a varsity basketball game between Easton High School and Central Aroostook High School. ""Two girls out here extremely overweight,"" one of them says on an apparent hot mic, according to the Press-Herald. ""Awful."" Laughter follows the disparaging comments, the outlet reported. Shaw then talked about finding ""uniforms that fit the girls,"" and Carter singled out one of the girls by her uniform number. ""Wow,"" he said, according to NBC affiliate WCSH. ""Would you look at her?"" The school districts overseeing both Easton and Central Aroostook High School did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. But in a statement to WCSH, Easton Superintendent Mark Stanley said he became aware of their disparaging comments on Thursday night. ""We're a small school up here, we know all our kids really well, we're lucky in that regard, and so we know every single player that was on that team being talked about,"" he said. ""I think anger is probably the reaction everybody had when they saw and heard what happened. Both Shaw and Carter had been broadcasting games and providing commentary for about a month, the Press-Herald said. Shaw is a former athletic director at Easton and Carter a former coach from another school. Neither Carter nor Shaw realized they had their mics on while making the remarks, the Press-Herald reported. Parents were outraged upon hearing the remarks. Joseph Leach, whe has a daughter who plays for one of the teams disparaged by Carter and Shaw, felt ""mostly shock,"" according to the Press-Herald. ""I was home after the games and somebody shared the video with us and I instantly knew it was Jim Carter and Steve Shaw talking, and I really just couldn't believe what they were saying, honestly,"" Leach said. Carter told the Press-Herald he apologized to the superintendent. ""I don't even know what to say,"" Carter said. ""Hopefully everybody can get through this and be OK.""

1/17/2022,"There was a time when Donald Trump made news with his rallies—when he said things that utterly shocked us. Who could forget the firestorm he started, for example, when he went after Colin Kaepernick and other NFL players who knelt during the national anthem in 2017, or earlier that year when he called Barack Obama “the founder of ISIS”? Trump’s performance in Arizona on Saturday night—his first rally in months and his much-hyped chance to respond to the one-year anniversary of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot—was neither shocking nor terribly newsworthy. It didn’t even merit a mention on The Washington Post’s homepage Sunday morning. The New York Times only used Trump’s speech as a peg to write a broader story under the headline: “Trump Rally Underscores G.O.P. Tension Over How to Win in 2022.” A few years ago, Trump rallies spawned breathless coverage and drove multiple news cycles. But The Times’ story isn’t even about the rally, and their mentioning it is mostly perfunctory. To keep readers’ attention, The Times spotlighted a cast of supporting characters, such as Kari Lake, a Trump-endorsed candidate for Arizona governor who used to be a local news anchor. The photo of her in The Times shows her wearing some sort of cape, which I think we can all find mysterious. No wonder they used her. Kari Lake Is the Camera Ready, Big-Lie Loving Future of the MAGA Movement TV sitcom showrunners sometimes react to declining ratings by introducing a “Cousin Oliver”—which, quite often, is a cute kid whose smart-alecky sass is meant to liven up a tired atmosphere. Sometimes it works, sometimes it’s evidence a show has simply “jumped the shark.” But Trump’s never been an ensemble cast type of personality. He’s the whole show, and the surrounding players are as replaceable and ephemeral as Spinal Tap’s exploding drummers. The Arizona rally may have been the unofficial kickoff of his 2024 campaign. But this time around, Trump will have to work harder to break through—and not just because the media is less likely to give him ample air time free of charge. Call it the Andrew Dice Clay conundrum: If your entire schtick is based on shock value, eventually the audience grows inured, and the lack of substance becomes embarrassingly plain. Trump made assertions in Arizona Saturday night that might once have garnered buzz (on Sunday morning, at least). But they’re getting little play. In its writeup of the rally, Politico said Trump “issued a blistering response to Democrats” and that he “opened his speech by falsely claiming ‘proof’ that the 2020 election was ‘rigged.’” A more telling fact is that this “blistering response” was not deemed worthy enough to be the site’s lead story. What might have spawned outrage and wagging tongues a few years prior now elicits a collective chorus of yawns. Here’s the thing about moving the Overton Window: The process of shifting standards and assumptions matters greatly at the societal level. It’s bad when news consumers become desensitized to a former president erroneously claiming an election was stolen. It also cannibalizes one of Trump’s greatest assets: his ability to shock and awe. His schtick is tired, and that can often equate to a professional death sentence. Trump’s rock-concert rallies provide enough of his greatest hits for the fans and groupies who actually attend them. But for performers to remain relevant, they require new material. And politics is more stand-up comedy than rock and roll. The Rolling Stones can play their more-current hits a million times, yet we will still keep clamoring for “Sympathy For The Devil.” But can you imagine Chris Rock getting an HBO special and doing 2016 material? The same goes for Trump. Nobody wants to hear a political retread who rehashes his same tired conspiracy theories ad nauseam. Trump seems like the sort of man who could appreciate the temporal, consumerist, and disposable culture of modernity. We fetishize what is new and what is next. Yet, Trump’s obsession with relitigating an election that is now two calendar years past runs contrary to this modern American tendency. In this regard, his ego trumps his marketing savvy. The Real Tragedy of Jan. 6 Is That It’s Still Not Over To be sure, Trump also benefits from the (bogus) sense he was wronged. But it’s hard to see how such a backward-looking 75-year-old man can remain in the vanguard. On Saturday night, Trump wasn’t just stuck in 2020—he was also stuck in the 20th century. There were numerous references to communism (more so than usual), including a reference to the Jan. 6 Commission’s witness interviews, which he compared to Stalinist show trials. You might forgive Trump for such fanciful attacks on Nancy Pelosi and Congressional Democrats, since his criticism of Joe Biden isn’t terribly effective. Trump isn’t skilled at prosecuting a substantive policy critique, and, despite Biden’s low approval ratings, it’s really hard to get too worked up about him (the best Trump could do was mock him for seeming dazed and confused). All this is to say, the new material didn’t kill on Saturday night. The theme was “Make America Great Again…Again.” Even Trump’s apparel hinted at the likely sequel. He donned a red “Make America Great Again” hat that partially obscured his eyes most of the night, but it wasn’t the iconic version from the 2016 election. He was attempting to have it both ways by playing his “greatest hits” and floating some new material. But does lightning ever really strike twice? For every “Godfather II” masterpiece there’s dozens of “Ghostbusters II” failed sequels. We’d be fools to count Trump out entirely. If anyone in American lore is capable of a third act—it’s him. But he needs new material, and fast, because if his Arizona rally shows anything, it’s that the old routine just doesn’t land anymore. Read more at The Daily Beast.

1/17/2022,"Bella Herndon, 15, died by suicide in 2017 after she watched Netflix's ""13 Reasons Why."" Her father's lawsuit against Netflix, blaming the streaming giant for the death, was dismissed by a federal judge this week. He told Insider that he plans to appeal the decision. This week, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against Netflix brought by a grieving father who said the TV show ""13 Reasons Why"" was to blame for his 15-year-old daughter's death by suicide in April 2017. But John Herndon of Livermore, California plans to appeal the decision, he said during an interview with Insider. ""We disagree with the district court's decision, and we do intend to appeal,"" he said. ""We appreciate the district court's consideration of the issue."" Herndon has accused Netflix of using sophisticated algorithms to ""target highly vulnerable children,"" including his daughter Bella, and alleges that kids were ""directly manipulated"" into watching dangerous content, court documents show. Netflix disputes this, saying in court filings that restrictions on programming would result in self-censorship. Bella Herndon was a 15-year-old girl who loved writing short stories, reading voraciously about Greek mythology, and spending time with her family and tight-knit group of friends. ""She was very intelligent, inquisitive, and very quick,"" her father told Insider. ""She and I were like best buddies."" When Bella died by suicide in April 2017, he said it came ""completely out of the blue"" and was a ""total surprise"" to their family. Bella had been seeing a therapist who had advised him that everything was looking ""very well,"" Herndon added. It was only on the day of her funeral, he said, that he became aware that she had been watching Netflix's ""13 Reasons Why"" — a controversial teen drama that revolved around the suicide of the main character Hannah Baker. Bella's school friends approached the late teenager's father in the church and explained that she watched the show in her final days. ""I had no idea,"" Herndon said. ""The kids were extremely open and honest about how they felt about it and how they believed that it affected Bella."" Herndon concluded that Bella had died ""as a result of the tortious acts and omissions of Netflix that caused, or at least substantially contributed to, her suicide,"" according to a class-action lawsuit filed in August. But this week, a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit against Netflix, following a response filed by the streaming giant in December, saying she based her ruling on free-speech protections. ""This is a tragic case,"" US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said on Tuesday, per The Hollywood Reporter. ""But ultimately, I don't think that it survives."" Insider reached out to Netflix for comment but did not immediately receive a response. The teen drama, which ran for four seasons between 2017 and 2020, was accused by critics and mental health professionals of glorifying suicide. ""13 Reasons Why,"" based on a book of the same name, originally (and controversially) depicted a graphic three-minute suicide scene in the last episode of season one. ""The show, before Netflix modified the content, gave a very detailed walkthrough of how this girl went about committing suicide,"" Herndon said. ""The way that she did it was particularly abhorrent to me as a father and as a reasonable person."" In July 2019, Netflix edited the scene out. ""But it was too late — the damage had already been done,"" Herndon told Insider. ""All of the medical research that we've looked at so far has just pointed to the fact that this is not content that you would show to a young audience."" A 2019 study found that teen suicides increased in the months after the show first aired. Herndon maintains that what he alleges Netflix did is immoral. ""As parents, we do everything, every single day, to teach our kids the difference between right and wrong,"" he said. ""I think this show, and there are others like it, are the complete antithesis to the moral rules and laws that we were all raised to understand,"" he continued. Bella's father said he would continue to speak up about what happened to his daughter in the hope of raising awareness about the dangers of harmful content promoted to children. ""All of this is to bring to the attention of the world that this kind of activity is something as parents and as a society that we need to address.""

1/17/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Donald Trump stepped up his election-year effort to dominate the Republican Party, holding a rally in Arizona on Saturday in which he castigated anyone who dares to question his lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, including the state’s GOP governor, Doug Ducey. But 2,000 miles to the east in Washington, there are small signs that some Republicans are tiring of the charade. Mike Rounds, the generally unassuming senator from South Dakota, was perhaps the boldest in acknowledging the reality that the election was in fact fair. Instead of being shunned, he was supported by his GOP colleagues, including Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. Rounds later said the party needed to get “ louder ” in telling voters the truth about the 2020 campaign. Meanwhile, top Republicans in Washington have engaged in a behind-the-scenes effort to encourage Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, one of Trump’s most vocal antagonists in the party, to run for a Senate seat. And on Saturday, Glenn Youngkin became the first Republican since 2010 to be sworn in as Virginia’s governor after running a campaign that kept Trump at arm's length. Less than two months before the 2022 primary season begins, Trump remains the most popular figure among the voters who will decide which Republicans advance to the fall general election. But the recent dynamics bring new clarity to the debate that will likely animate the GOP all year: how closely candidates should align themselves with Trump and his election lie. “I was very encouraged by the response from a number of different senators supportive of Sen. Rounds,” said former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has been a rare Republican urging the party to move on from Trump and his election obsession.  There is no evidence to support Trump’s claims that the election was stolen. Elections officials and his own attorney general rejected the notion. Trump’s arguments have also been roundly dismissed by the courts, including judges appointed by the former president. Still, dissent from Trump's election lie within the GOP remains rare. From Ohio to Georgia and Arizona, candidates running for Senate, governor and attorney general have fully embraced Trump’s falsehoods as they have tried to win over his endorsement, deflect his fury or win over his base. Those efforts were on full display in Arizona Saturday night as Trump-endorsed candidates falsely declared the election had been stolen and Trump the duly elected president. In the short term, such positioning may help Republican candidates come out on top in primary fields that are often crowded. But there are concerns that it could hurt the party in the fall, especially among suburban voters who have become increasingly decisive in recent campaigns. The further to the right that Republicans go now, the easier it could become for their Democratic rivals to portray them as extreme in a general election.  And any time candidates spend looking backward is time not spent attacking President Joe Biden, who is seen as particularly vulnerable due to rising inflation and coronavirus cases. “It’s one of those issues that’s quintessentially popular in a primary and unpopular in a general,"" said Chris DeRose, a Republican attorney and former clerk of the superior court in Arizona's Maricopa County.  He said candidates, who often privately acknowledge the election was fair, were clearly courting the former president by expressing skepticism about the 2020 election. “Donald Trump’s obviously the most sought-after endorsement among Republican candidates,"" he said. “That can make all the difference in a Republican primary.” John Shimkus, a Republican and former Illinois congressman, said it was easy for “armchair quarterbacks” who aren’t on the ballot to judge candidates doing what they can to win their primaries.  “All the races are going to be fought by Trump and highlighted on Fox. So these candidates have to be very, very careful. They have to win the primary to win the general,"" he said.  The risk, however, is clear in Arizona's Senate race. In a year favoring Republicans, the state should be a relatively attainable pickup and some in the party are eager for Ducey to enter the race against Democratic incumbent Mark Kelly. But Trump's repeated attacks on Ducey, who has refused to back election conspiracies, could make it hard for him to succeed in a GOP primary. Before his trip, Trump, who continues to tease another run for president in 2024, issued a statement that he would never endorse Ducey. And he continued to rail against him at the rally, which was dominated by his grievances over the election that was held more than 14 months ago. “He’s a disaster,” said Trump. “Ducey has been a terrible, terrible representative of your state."" Whichever Republicans emerge on top in Arizona and other critical races will have to convince voters that they should participate in an election system Trump has spent years deriding as rigged. Many Republicans still blame Trump for the party’s loss of Georgia's two Senate runoff elections in 2021, arguing he depressed turnout by undermining confidence in the voting system, denying them control of the Senate. (Trump has argued that further investigation is the only way to instill confidence in future elections.) “Trump still has this outsized voice and influence and too many candidates fear his wrath,” said Charlie Dent, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania and Trump critic. “We know Donald Trump will use his megaphone to condemn those who don’t buy his lies and his false narrative on the 2020 election. So these candidates are put in a bind: If they tell the truth, they run the risk of losing their primaries and incurring the wrath of Trump, and if they acquiesce and go along with this nonsense, they run the risk of alienating a lot of voters.” Still, DeRose said he has no concern that the issue will depress turnout, despite what happened in Georgia. “The Republican base is quite enthusiastic,” he said, predicting turnout on par with 2010, when Republicans made historic gains in the House. With soaring inflation, ongoing criticism over Biden's pullout from Afghanistan, he said, ""Things aren’t going well in this country and I think you’re going to see this enormous blowback.” Others disagreed. Barbara Comstock, a Trump critic and former GOP congresswoman from Virginia, warned Republicans risked nominating fringe candidates who would go on to lose in the general. “Republicans feel like they’re going to win no matter who's on the ticket. And I don’t agree with that thesis,"" she said, pointing to Ohio, where Senate candidates have been trying to desperately out-Trump one another. “I think you really are taking a chance in blowing reliable races.” Nonetheless, Trump remained fixated on the issue on Saturday in Florence, Arizona, a Republican stronghold about 70 miles southeast of Phoenix. It's the first of what aides say will be a brisker pace of Trump events in the coming months. Trump on Friday announced another rally later in January in Texas, where the March 1 primary formally ushers in the midterm campaign. ___ Associated Press writer Stephen Groves in Pierre, South Dakota, contributed to this report",Politics/Associated Press,Some in GOP begin testing party's lockstep loyalty to Trump,https://news.yahoo.com/gops-midterm-dilemma-closely-align-053905308.html
