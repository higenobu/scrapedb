3/28/2022,"Cressida Dick has won a victory after the government agreed to a review of how she came to leave office after a clash with the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. The Home Office is expected to announce it will ask Sir Tom Winsor to examine how Dick came to be ousted as commissioner of the Metropolitan police last month, a government source confirmed. Dick resigned rather than go to a meeting with Khan about the scandals plaguing the Met and attempts to rebuild public confidence. She believed her plans for reforms were good enough, but he did not. The government did not step in and back her when it became clear Khan had lost confidence in her leadership. In the aftermath of Dick’s resignation, her deputy, Sir Stephen House, wrote to the home secretary demanding a review of how the Met commissioner had come to leave office. The government has taken more than a month to consider House’s demands, and has now agreed. Sources in government and City Hall said the review would not “change any outcomes”. Negotiations between the mayor and Dick about the date and terms of her departure – such as a payout of about £500,000 – continue. One area the review may examine is “communications” between City Hall and the Met’s top team, and whether it was as clear and effective as it should have been. It is understood the proposed exit terms for Dick initially included a confidentiality clause, but City Hall sources insist that was dropped on the insistence of Khan and the commissioner will be free to criticise whoever she wants when she leaves office. Government sources say the wrangling has delayed the formal advert for the Met commissioner’s job being published, meaning it could be summer until a new top officer is chosen or in place to lead the UK’s ’s biggest force. News of the review was first reported by the Mail on Sunday. Winsor is the chief inspector of constabulary whose time in office ends this week. Khan, as well as being London mayor, is the police and crime commissioner for London. The government is also reviewing the power and effectiveness of police and crime commissioners. The appointment and removal of the Met commissioner is made by the home secretary, Priti Patel, who has to have due regard for the views of the London mayor. In September last year Patel and Khan backed Dick being granted a two-year extension to her five-year term in the job, which was due to end next month. Relations between Dick and Khan soured after revelations about hate messages circulating among officers at Charing Cross police station from 2016 to 2018. The mayor was angered that nine of them were still serving in the Met, with two promoted. Dick had been pressed to come up with a plan to deal with the huge problems facing the Met, and in the mayor’s view failed to do so. She was due to attend with a meeting with the mayor to discuss her plans, having been told beforehand that Khan viewed them as inadequate. Dick then decided to resign as commissioner rather than attend meeting with Khan. At that stage Khan had not formally declared he had lost confidence in the commissioner, but few doubt that is where things were headed. A public declaration of his loss of confidence in her would have left her with no choice but to resign. There is process enshrined in law for the removal of a commissioner, either by sacking or a declaration no confidence, which involves giving written reasons for the decision and an opportunity for them to provide a response. City Hall believes those laws do not apply because the commissioner chose to resign. A City Hall source said: “Rather than wasting officials’ time and taxpayers’ money ordering a politically motivated inquiry about the resignation of a police commissioner who has overseen a host of scandals, the home secretary should finally show leadership and focus on the job of sorting out the huge issues facing the Met and police forces across the country – as well as fixing her scheme so that Ukrainian refugees can find sanctuary in our country.” Announcing his demand for a review last month, House said: “I feel deeply disappointed. There’s a clear procedure in statute laid down to allow the removal of a police chief officer. It’s not been followed in this instance; it’s not even been initiated in this instance. “Due process has not been followed, and instead we’ve seen matters played out in the media. Because of this, I’ve written to the home secretary to ask her to have a review carried out of the events that have taken place.”",News/UK news,Goverment agrees to review of how Cressida Dick was ousted as Met chief,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/27/goverment-to-review-how-cressida-dick-was-ousted-as-met-chief
3/28/2022,"Claims by 20 women of sexual harassment and bullying against the actor Noel Clarke will not lead to a criminal police investigation, according to the Metropolitan police. Clarke was the subject of complaints of groping and sexual misconduct in incidents between 2004 and 2019. He is best known for his work on the “hood” series of films, beginning with Kidulthood in 2006, and the BBC’s Doctor Who. The allegations, made by women who knew him in a professional capacity, were revealed by the Guardian in April 2021. They included that Clarke said to one woman that he planned to “fuck her and fire her”, and that he had secretly filmed a naked audition. It had been claimed by former London School of Dramatic Art students that Clarke had encouraged them to undress in improvisation workshops. After the complaints came to light, the Met said it was investigating. However, on Friday Scotland Yard said it would not launch a formal investigation “following a thorough assessment by specialist detectives”. A spokesperson said: “We have updated the complainants. If any further allegations related to those already assessed are reported then it will be thoroughly considered.” Anna Birley, a member of the campaign group Reclaim These Streets, which recently won a high court case against the Met, told the Daily Mirror that reports should be taken seriously and women listened to. “It must be hugely upsetting for women who have been so brave and spoken out to hear that the police don’t believe their testimonies are enough.” Birley added: “Our criminal justice system fails women time and again.” In the aftermath of the sexual harassment claims, Bafta withdrew an award for outstanding British contribution to cinema it had bestowed just over a fortnight before. It faced criticism for giving Clarke the gong despite having warnings about his behaviour and conduct. Actors including Christina Chong, who starred alongside Clarke in Bulletproof, tweeted that the allegations about him were “the UK film industry’s best-kept secret for years. If in doubt, trust me, it’s true.” Since the claims, Clarke stood down from his production company. Shows he starred in, including Sky’s Bulletproof, were pulled from schedules and cancelled. He has not commented on the Met’s announcement, but in a previous statement said: “I vehemently deny any sexual misconduct or criminal wrongdoing. Recent reports however have made it clear to me that some of my actions have affected people in ways I did not intend or realise. “To those individuals, I am deeply sorry. I will be seeking professional help to educate myself and change for the better.”",Arts/Culture,Police will not investigate sexual harassment claims against Noel Clarke,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/27/police-will-not-investigate-sexual-harassment-claims-against-noel-clarke
3/28/2022,"With speculation about his future as England captain at fever pitch after England slumped to defeat against West Indies in Grenada to confirm another lost series, Joe Root has recommitted himself to the role, insisting the team are rapidly improving and that he remains the best person to lead them into the next phase of their development. England have now won just one of their past 17 Tests, and for the first time in their 145-year history they have not won any of five successive series. Five years after his appointment as captain Root’s leadership has been savagely criticised, particularly since the third-day collapse that left England on 103 for eight overnight in their second innings and leading by just 10 runs. They extended that to 27 before Jack Leach became the last wicket to fall, and West Indies romped to their victory target in less than five overs and without losing a wicket. “I think I’ve spoken quite enough on the subject,” Root said about the captaincy. “I am very passionate about taking this team forward. I made that clear ahead of the game and that is not going to waver. “I know this is a results-based business but it does not feel like we are far away from getting results. I’ll throw everything at it, do anything I can to help England win. That’s not going to change. I’m very passionate about being the man to take this team forward.” The first two Tests of the series were drawn, and in the decider England’s top seven batters scored a total of 127 runs across their two innings, of which the opener Alex Lees was responsible for 49%. Root himself scored only five. “For the majority of this series we played so much good cricket and made big strides forward as a team,” he said. “We showed improvements in a number of different areas but two and a half sessions of bad cricket have really let us down. It has cost us the series and that is such a frustration for myself and the whole group, because we have done so much good throughout this trip. It would be easy to look at [Saturday] in isolation and let that overshadow some brilliant cricket.” With Root himself scoring two centuries in the series, Jonny Bairstow, Zak Crawley and Ben Stokes also reaching triple figures, and Jack Leach taking 11 wickets – enough to tie with West Indies’ Jayden Seales and Kemar Roach as the most dangerous bowlers in the series – while producing some obstinate batting displays of his own, it has not been a trip entirely without positives. “We are making strides forward as a team,” Root said. “It was just two bad sessions and that is the area we have to keep looking at: making better decisions more frequently under pressure as a batting group. We showed in the first Test we can do that. We have just got to do it more frequently and that is where frustration lies, because everyone has proved they can do what it takes to win Test matches. It is so frustrating because we feel so close.” Kraigg Brathwaite, the leading run-scorer in his first home series as West Indies captain and scorer of the winning runs, praised England’s performance in those first two Tests. “In two hard-fought draws I thought England played very well and we had to show some fight in the last days of both of those games,” he said. “But coming here, we ramped it up. It’s been a remarkable effort.” Paul Collingwood, who was promoted to interim head coach in February when Chris Silverwood was sacked at the end of the Ashes series, declared his desire to stay in the role. A full-time appointment is expected before England’s next Test fixture, against New Zealand in June. “I’ve enjoyed the last few weeks,” he said. “I feel there’s been a really good response from the players. Of course there’ll be disappointment around this game. I want to make a difference and hopefully from inside the dressing room there has been a change and if they decide they want to give me a job I’d certainly take it. I’ve enjoyed it a lot more than I was expecting to.”",Sport/Sport,Joe Root says he is still the man to ‘take England forward’ after series defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/27/joe-root-says-he-is-still-the-man-to-take-england-forward-after-series-defeat
