3/15/2022,"The final design of the National Gallery of Victoria’s contemporary arts space has been unveiled, with the state’s creative industries minister, Danny Pearson, describing it as Melbourne’s equivalent to the Eiffel Tower. Pearson on Tuesday announced the winning design, by Angelo Candalepas and Associates, which includes 13,000 sq metres of exhibition space, a rooftop terrace and restaurant with CBD views, a 40-metre-high spherical entrance hall and scientific laboratories for the conservation of art. NGV Contemporary will look out onto new public parklands connecting St Kilda Road in Southbank to Melbourne’s riverfront. “This is going to be an absolute gamechanger for our state. It’s going to put us on the world map as being a destination for great creative and cultural events,” Pearson said. “As the Eiffel Tower is to Paris, the NGVC will be to Melbourne.” NGV director, Tony Ellwood, said the building would create a cultural legacy that will resonate for generations. “We’ve often said we need something that defines our city, architecturally – I think this is the building,” he said. Pearson said more than 11,000 jobs will be created over the life of the project and the gallery will generate hundreds of ongoing creative sector jobs when it opens in 2028. Construction work is expected to begin next year. Plans to build the gallery and redevelop the arts precinct were first announced by the state government in 2018, after it bought the Carlton and United Breweries building at 77 Southbank Boulevard for about $95m. The state government committed $1.46bn for the first phase of the work in the 2020/21 budget, with an additional $241m announced for restoration works to the state theatre in November last year. Opposition leader Matthew Guy said he was supportive of the precinct’s redevelopment.",Arts/Art and design,‘Gamechanger’: design unveiled for National Gallery of Victoria’s contemporary art space,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/15/gamechanger-design-unveiled-for-national-gallery-of-victorias-contemporary-art-space
3/15/2022,"The New South Wales rail union has threatened to use industrial action to force the state government to offer free fares to commuters as it continues to ramp up its long-running dispute over pay and conditions. On Tuesday, the secretary of the NSW Rail, Tram and Bus Union, Alex Claassens, said workers would escalate industrial action in response to the government’s decision to sensationally shut down the rail network last month unless it began offering free fares every Friday until June. According to Claassens, from next Friday, the union will mandate a ban on overtime for signal workers – a step which would have a severe impact on the rail system – as well as a series of other actions, if the government does not provide free fares. “You can’t just shut down a railway with no notice whatsoever, falsely accuse workers of being behind it, and then hope everyone just forgets about it,” Claassens said. “The NSW government said it would look into giving commuters free rail travel as a way of saying sorry for their appalling actions, but since then we’ve heard nothing. “Giving commuters free trips as compensation for the huge inconvenience the government caused them is the absolute least people deserve.” The comments mark a significant escalation in an ongoing industrial fight which began when a previous enterprise agreement expired last May. The union has run a series of rolling industrial actions in a bid to force the government to make concessions on pay and safety demands. Last month’s shutdown prompted a significant scandal within the government after the transport minister David Elliott incorrectly blamed the union for a “strike” and accused them of “terrorist-like activity”. It later emerged it was the government which had ordered the shutdown due to safety concerns, and that Elliott had gone to bed while bureaucrats scrambled to make a call on the network after negotiations fell apart at the 11th hour. After the shutdown, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Elliott was set to announce half-price peak hour travel and free fares on weekends to apologise for the chaotic shutdown that left thousands of commuters stranded. The union has been engaged in ongoing industrial action for months, and is due to begin a new round of action on 20 March. Claassens said the union would now seek to escalate that action from next Friday in a bid to force the government to offer free fares on Fridays. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “If [premier Dominic] Perrottet refuses, rail workers will resort to industrial action that forces the government to provide it,” he said. “Workers are still waiting on offers from the government to resolve basic safety claims that were made nine months ago. It’s beyond ridiculous that we’re still taking industrial action to force the government to do its job.” It marks the latest outbreak in hostilities in the long-running dispute, as the union seeks to force the government to return to the negotiating table after Claassens said talks had stalled in recent weeks. The two parties are due to meet again this Thursday. Sydney’s rail network has been regularly thrown into chaos in recent weeks, due to damage from recent rainfall. Elliott’s office has been contacted for comment.",News/Australia news,‘The absolute least people deserve’: Rail union threatens action on Sydney trains unless free travel offered,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/15/the-absolute-least-people-deserve-rail-union-threatens-action-on-sydney-trains-unless-free-travel-offered
3/15/2022,"Watching the flood waters rise in the Northern Rivers, Queensland and far western Sydney last week, I’ve had a horrible sense of deja vu. Dread. Exhaustion. Abandonment. And a rising, furious anger. I’ve been a New South Wales Rural Fire Service volunteer for several years. My unit is based in the Blue Mountains. In late 2019, I was involved in what is now called the Black Summer. These floods are horribly reminiscent of that time. Not just because of the scale of the disaster, but because people in some of the worst circumstances imaginable have, again, been abandoned by the government. Over Black Summer, the prime minister went overseas for a holiday. He should have been in Australia, if only to demonstrate support for the communities that were really suffering. It was an insensitive thing to do – especially when people like myself were giving up time with our kids to protect our communities. I can only talk for myself, but I was baffled that there was so little support for RFS volunteers and our communities from the federal government. Seeing the scenes from Lismore and Brisbane and Richmond over the last week, I get the same feeling. The months of Black Summer were the hardest of my life. Not just because of the fires, or the fear and devastation I saw in the towns, or the nights, days and weekends away from my kids. As the months dragged on, and me and my mates exhausted ourselves trying to defend or save what we could, I was thinking: where’s the government? When are they coming to help? Why are we on our own? Firefighting and preparation is some of the most backbreaking work you can do. Imagine hacking defensive lines through the scrub, backburning in dense bush, dragging heavy equipment through difficult, dangerous terrain to put out fires and doing most of that in heavy PPE and thick smoke. None of that was surprising – it comes with the job. But the length and intensity of that fire season was something else. For weeks on end, I spent every moment I physically could on the fireground. When I couldn’t do that, I helped people in the community prepare or went to my full-time job. I spent New Year’s Eve patrolling a defensive burn. I’d get stopped on the street by people who wanted to know what was happening. There was no downtime. Life became a blur. I barely saw my kids although it was school holidays. I ran out of paid leave, so I took unpaid leave. That was a financial hit. There’s little else you can do when your community is at risk and when your mates are as tired as you are. There’s no one else to do it. This is no criticism of the RFS. The RFS was amazing. I always felt supported and still do. They did an unbelievable job with the resources they had. The communities, too, were unbelievable – you have no idea how much that meant. People brought us home cooked meals. Kids drew pictures. Everyone knew that season was above and beyond. But volunteers need time to heal. Seeing burnt-out houses and hearing stories of people dying to defend their homes, seeing that level of fire intensity and living on high alert for months scars you. It feels like a lifetime and several world-changing events away, but Black Summer was only two years ago. That’s another reason I think these floods are so frightening. They’re evidence that climate change is already here, and we are nowhere near prepared for it. Anyone on the ground will tell you that the summers are getting hotter, and the fires are getting worse. We’ve had at least four major catastrophic fires in recent history. Climate change means the old volunteer model we’ve used for decades to respond to natural disasters isn’t as effective. It was never designed to tie people up for weeks or months at a time. Many volunteers are older too; there’s only so long they can do the physical work the RFS requires. Listening to politicians talk about people being “tough” and “resilient” makes me so angry now. We are tough, but we’re human too. We have families and responsibilities that we can’t just set aside. When a disaster like Black Summer or these floods happens, community spirit only gets you so far. We need dedicated government support – not just more funding and bodies on the ground, but a wholesale reassessment of what disasters from now on are going to look like, and what we’ll need to help people through them. We also need a government that finally bites the bullet and admits that corporations burning coal and gas are heating the planet, which is killing people and destroying entire communities. Australia is the third-largest exporter of fossil fuels in the world – behind only Russia and Saudi Arabia. Pretending that our massive coal and gas exports aren’t fuelling these disasters is unbelievably cynical. I want a government that helps me to help my community when we need it. People want to help their neighbours. It’s a natural instinct. But to just expect regular people to do all the work without backing them to do it is crazy. It feels like, on a fundamental level, the government just doesn’t get that. I hope I’m wrong. I hope that the floods wake us up in a way the fires didn’t. When the election comes around, I hope people remember who turned up to help, and who didn’t.  The writer is a RFS volunteer in western Sydney and a GetUp member.

3/15/2022,"China has already decided to provide Russia with economic and financial support during its war on Ukraine and is contemplating sending military supplies such as armed drones, US officials fear. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, laid out the US case against Russia’s invasion in an “intense” seven-hour meeting in Rome with his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, pointing out that Moscow had feigned interest in diplomacy while preparing for invasion, and also that the Russian military was clearly showing signs of frailty. Earlier, it was reported that the US had told allies that China “responded positively” to a Russian request for military equipment, a claim Beijing has denied. An employee of Russian interrupted a Russian state TV broadcast by shouting “No to war” and holding a sign that read “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” The poster held up by Marina Ovsyannikova on Monday evening also said, in English, “Russians against the war”. The protest was welcomed by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who said: “I’m thankful to those Russians who don’t stop trying to deliver the truth.” Russia-Ukraine talks will continue on Tuesday, Zelenskiy said. In an address on Monday night he also called on Russian soldiers to surrender. Addressing them directly he said: “What are you dying for?… If you surrender to our forces we will treat you as humans have to be treated, with dignity.” The UK’s Ministry of Defence said Russia could be planning to use chemical or biological weapons in a “faked attack” in Ukraine or a “staged discovery” of biological agents. “Almost all” of the Russian advances in Ukraine “remain stalled”, a senior US defence official said during a background briefing, CNN reports. Russian forces moving on Kyiv have not appreciably progressed over the weekend. A close ally of Putin, national guard chief Viktor Zolotov, blamed the slower than expected progress on what he claimed were far-right Ukrainian forces hiding behind civilians. US president Joe Biden is considering travelling to Europe for in-person meetings with Nato allies, Reuters reports. Biden could meet other leaders in Brussels on 23 March and then travel to Poland, the report said. A convoy of more than 160 cars departed from Mariupol today, local officials said, in what appeared to be the first successful attempt to evacuate civilians from the encircled Ukrainian city. After several days of failed attempts to deliver supplies to Mariupol and provide safe passage out for trapped civilians, the city council said a local ceasefire was holding and the convoy had left for the city of Zaporizhzhia. The mayor of Ukraine’s frontline city of Kharkiv said the city had been under constant attack by Russian forces, Reuters reports. Speaking on national television, Ihor Terekhov said Russian troops had fired at central districts causing an unspecified number of casualties. A Russian airstrike hit a residential building in Kyiv as Moscow’s forces stepped up their brutal campaign to capture Ukraine’s capital and other major cities. One person was found dead in the nine-storey apartment building, officials said, with three more people hospitalised as air raid sirens sounded in the capital and other cities hours before Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were set to resume talks. The Antonov aircraft plant in Kyiv was shelled by Russian forces, the Kyiv city administration said in an update on its official Telegram account on Monday morning. At least two people were killed and seven injured, it said. Ukrainian authorities have denied accusations by Russia after a Ukrainian missile allegedly exploded in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk killing 20 civilians. Ukrainian military spokesperson Leonid Matyukhin said the missile, that carried warhead shrapnel, was in fact a Russian rocket. The Russian and Ukrainian claims cannot be independently verified. There are reports that Russian forces blew up explosives at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s parliament earlier said Russian troops planned to begin “disposal” of ammunition in front of the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe’s largest nuclear power station. At least nine people were reportedly killed and nine more wounded in an airstrike on a television tower in Ukraine’s northern Rivne region today. “There are still people under the rubble,” governor Vitaliy Koval said in an online post, Reuters reports. Ninety children have been killed and more than 100 wounded in Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February, the Ukrainian general prosecutor’s office said. “The highest number of victims are in the Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kherson, Mykolayiv and Zhytomyr regions,” it said in a statement. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said Russian forces were “behaving like terrorists” and Putin had started a “full-scale war” in the centre of Europe that could “become a third world war”. Addressing the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, he said Europe “chose the road of pacifying the aggressor” for years instead of “defending the values of democracy, the rule of law and human rights”.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 20 of the Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-20-of-the-russian-invasion
3/15/2022,"Residential property prices reached their strongest annual growth on record last year, rising 23.7% in the last 12 months. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics residential property prices index report, which began reporting in 2003, the total value of the nation’s 10.8m homes grew by $2tn to a record $9.9tn last year. Australia’s property market has seen astronomical growth, spurred by record-low interest rates and government stimulus. Each capital city recorded price surges, with Hobart (+29.8%), Canberra (+28.8%), Brisbane (+27.8%), Sydney (+26.7%), and Adelaide (+23.9%) all showing the largest annual rises. Melbourne (+20.0%) had the largest annual rise since the June quarter of 2010 while Perth rose 15.7% and Darwin rose 13.0% through the year. The rise means real estate value in Australia has now reached $9.9tn, with the mean price of residential dwellings going up a further $44,000 to hit $920,100 across the country. It comes just weeks after a report from the National Housing Finance and Investment Corp revealed the average first homebuyer is locked out of 70% of the housing market. First homebuyers now need nine years to save a deposit compared to four years in the 1990s, the report found. The ABS head of prices statistics, Michelle Marquardt, said the data showed house price growth continued to outpace price growth for attached dwellings. “House prices rose 27.5% through the year, while prices of attached dwellings rose 14.0%,” Marquardt said. In the December quarter 2021, residential property prices rose 4.7%. The strongest quarterly price growth was recorded in Brisbane (+9.6%), followed by Adelaide (+6.8%), Hobart (+6.5%), and Canberra (+6.4%). “Results were consistent with a range of housing market indicators,” Marquardt said. “New lending commitments for housing rose to a record high value in the December quarter 2021. Days on market fell and sales transaction volumes increased. Record low interest rates and strong demand have continued to support growth in property prices.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The mean price of residential dwellings in Australia was $920,100, up from $876,100 in the September quarter 2021. The mean price of residential dwellings in New South Wales rose by $47,700 to $1,207,200 and was the highest in the country. The second highest mean price was in the Australian Capital Territory ($979,600), followed by Victoria ($956,100). The lowest mean price ($489,000) was in the Northern Territory.

The price growth is creating a housing crisis with many Australians locked out of the property market and others staring down a multimillion loan that will last them their lifetimes. Last year the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) assistant governor, Luci Ellis, admitted it was very difficult for people to enter the housing market if their parents didn’t already own a home. “Some people will find it easier to buy a home than others based on the socioeconomic position they were born into,” she said.",News/Australia news,Australia records strongest annual growth in home prices,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/15/australia-records-strongest-annual-growth-in-home-prices
