3/12/2022,"By Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and NATO are shipping weapons into Ukraine at break-neck speed, including highly sensitive items such as shoulder-fired missiles called Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems (MANPADS) that can take down aircraft. The Western arms deliveries, another one of which is expected to arrive in the coming hours, have been vital to enabling Ukrainians to fight the invading Russians forces far more effectively and fiercely than U.S. intelligence expected. But moving those amounts of weaponry into the largest conflict in Europe since World War Two carries with it risks that some could fall into the wrong hands -- a possibility the West has considered. ""Frankly, we believe that risk is worth taking right now because the Ukrainians are fighting so skillfully with the tools at their disposal and they're using them so creatively,"" a senior U.S. defense official said on Friday when asked about that danger. Highly portable missiles such as Stinger surface-to-air missiles -- which are a type of MANPAD -- can help win wars, but in the past they have also been lost, sold, or wound up in the arsenals of extremist groups. For example, hundreds of Stingers supplied by the United States were seen as key to helping mujahideen rebels drive Soviet forces out of Afghanistan in a conflict that spanned the 1980s and 1990s. But the United States subsequently spent years trying to recover unused MANPADS from that country and from other conflict zones around the world. In a Pentagon-financed study in 2019, the RAND Corp. think-tank estimated that upwards of 60 civilian aircraft have been hit by MANPADS since the 1970s, killing more than 1,000 civilians. As of 2019, 57 non-state armed groups were confirmed to possess or suspected to possess MANPADS. Russia was ""far and away the single largest exporter of MANPADS"", RAND Corp. said, with more than 10,000 systems sold between 2010 and 2018 to countries including Iraq, Venezuela, Kazakhstan, Qatar, and Libya. The United States and NATO have not disclosed how many MANPADS have been transferred to Ukraine since the start of the invasion, which is now in its third week. So far, Russia has not targeted Western weapons convoys headed into Ukraine and the senior U.S. defense official said the United States had not seen any Western-supplied inventory falling into Russian hands. But that could change. At a Friday meeting of Russia's Security Council, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu talked about potential future seizures of Western-made Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stingers. They should be handed to Russian-backed forces in the breakaway Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly backed the idea. ""As to the delivery of arms, especially Western-made ones which have fallen into the hands of the Russian army - of course I support the possibility of giving these to the military units of the Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics,"" Putin said. ""Please do this,"" Putin told Shoigu.

3/12/2022,"An abandoned GoPro kickstarted a search for a mystery paddleboarder. The person was having a peaceful day at a Colorado state park. The skies were blue, and the water seemed peaceful, video from the GoPro showed. The paddleboarder still crashed, however, and went tumbling into the water. They weren’t seen again on video. Now, officials are searching for them. “As we’ve been cleaning up the shoreline, which is typically underwater, we found a GoPro of your trip to Highline Lake,” Highline Lake State Park posted on Facebook March 8. “It was not reported to our staff to log in our Lost and Found but we’d still like to return it to you.” Officials are following some clues left behind in the footage. The person must like paddle boarding, and they know the date the person visited the park. Additionally, they know the person must’ve had a good time in Las Vegas shortly before their paddle boarding trip. “Based on the videos, it appears you had a nice, relaxing trip to the park after your trip to Vegas,” officials said. If the mystery paddleboarder emails state park officials with the date they visited and the model of the GoPro, they can get their camera back. Officials said if something is ever lost at the park, the owner should report it to the visitor center so it can be returned if found. “In the last month we’ve been able to return three wallets, three sets of keys, and numerous credit cards which would have been underwater if not for our barrier net project,” officials said. Highline Lake is “an oasis in the desert” in the Grand Junction area, Colorado Parks and Wildlife said. The park is about 80 miles northeast of Moab, Utah, a popular tourist destination.

3/12/2022,"As the war in Ukraine rages on, a defiant Ukrainian General has sent out a stark warning to Russian troops entering the country. Vladimir Putin's soldiers in Mykolaiv, a key staging post for control of the Black Sea, have been met with fierce resistance, putting an early end to Russia’s attempt at advancing. General Dmytro Marchenko, of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, has now told The Times that Ukrainian resistance is not phased by Russian soldiers continuing with their bombardment. He said: “It’s unpleasant to say this but their corpses are food for stray dogs. “We’re not able to retrieve them because of continuing Russian fire in those areas.” Marchenko insisted that Ukrainian troops “won’t shoot any Russian soldiers who give up” but warned: “The rest of them will become dog food.” While troops have been forced to a retreat in Mykolaiv, Vladimir Putin continues his deadly onslaught in other parts of the country – including striking at maternity hospital in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike as an “atrocity” and reiterated his call to Western nations to impose a no-fly zone. Watch: Mykolaiv mayor gives update on his besieged city Mayor of Mykolaiv Oleksandr Syenkevych gives an update from his city on the Black Sea coast. On Monday, Russian military forces opened fire on Mykolaiv, according to Ukraine's General Staff. Boris Johnson described the attach as “depraved” and said the UK was considering more support for Ukraine to defend itself against airstrikes. Mariupol deputy mayor Sergei Orlov said this morning that at least three people had been killed in the strike, including a six-year-old child. Around 17 people were reportedly injured in the strike against the hospital, where the vast majority of patients are pregnant women – many of whom were in labour. Defence minister James Heappey accused Russia of committing a war crime by striking the hospital, telling BBC Breakfast this morning: “We ask ourselves the question how did this happen? Was it an indiscriminate use of artillery or missiles into a built-up area, or was a hospital explicitly targeted? “Both are equally despicable, both, as the Ukrainians have pointed out, would amount to a war crime.” Pressed on whether he thinks the attack constitutes a war crime, he replied: “Yes, if you deliberately target a piece of civilian infrastructure like a hospital, yes. “If you use indiscriminate artillery into an urban area without due regard for the reality, you could hit a protected site like a hospital, then that too in my view is.” President Zelenskyy posted footage online showing the damage from what he said was a “direct strike” on the hospital, with windows blown out and debris strewn through the corridors. In a call on Wednesday evening, Johnson joined Zelenskyy in condemning the strike, noting that this, together with reports Russian forces had failed to respect ceasefire agreements, was “yet further evidence that Putin was acting with careless disregard for international humanitarian law”, Downing Street said.",World/Yahoo News UK,Invading Russian troops 'will be dog food' insists defiant Ukrainian general,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-criris-invading-russian-troops-dog-food-dmytro-marchenko-111603411.html
3/12/2022,"An Ukrainian protester in the occupied city of Kherson said Russian armed forces are scared. The port city was the first major city to fall to Russia last Wednesday. Since the invasion, scores of demonstrators have taken to Kherson's streets in protest. A Ukrainian protester in the occupied city of Kherson said Russian forces are ""really scared"" of demonstrators who have taken to the streets since the city was invaded last week. In a promotional video posted to YouTube on Wednesday, an unnamed man in the city of Kherson described the Ukrainian response to Russian tanks in the city center. The video, titled ""Kherson is Ukraine,"" was posted by Kherson Now, a video channel that publishes ""socially relevant events and stories of Kherson,"" according to the channel. ""The people are ready to pull together, and even if it is necessary to arm themselves and drive the enemy out of our land,"" the man said in the video. Kherson, a key southern city along the Black Sea, was the first major city to fall to Russia on March 2. Home to nearly 300,000 people, the strategic port was besieged by Russian troops and tanks following days of fighting in the area that left approximately 300 Ukrainians dead, according to government officials. Since the city was seized last week, hundreds of Ukrainians have taken to the streets to protest the Russian occupation. Over the weekend, the city's mayor estimated that nearly 2,000 people attended a protest in Liberty Square, according to The New York Times. Video clips included in the Kherson Now video show scores of people draped in Ukrainian flags chanting and standing defiant against Russian troops. ""They are afraid of us so they put up fortifications,"" the narrator said, gesturing to a line of tanks parked some yards away from the crowd of demonstrators. ""When I was there, I was talking to the soldiers, they were really scared,"" he added. The man said the Russian troops threatened to shoot if protesters stormed the administration. A separate video reviewed by Insider showed Russian troops attempting to disperse crowds by firing into the air during a previous demonstration. ""They really know that people can't be stopped,"" the man in the Kherson Now video said. Still, he added, Ukrainian people are afraid themselves as well. ""Do not believe anyone who says we are not afraid of assault rifles that shot at us,"" he said. ""We are not afraid of provocations... we are afraid."" But despite that fear, he said Ukrainians are prepared to fight. ""We are ready for absolutely any scenarios and will resist any Russian scenarios,"" he said. Ukraine's military high command said on Wednesday that more than 400 protesters in Kherson had been detained by Russia's National Guard, according to Reuters.

3/12/2022,"An unidentified man in a Times Square subway was recorded hurling anti-Asian remarks at an Asian American woman.

Kat Yen, a New York City-based theater director and an M.F.A. candidate at Yale School of Drama, was on the Times Square subway when a man wearing a gray sweater and a black backpack started hurling anti-Asian remarks at her.

Yen posted the incident on her Instagram account in three separate, minute-long posts. In the first video, she captioned, “First day back in NYC and I'm already the victim of a hate crime. It happened at the 42nd subway station, the same station where Michelle Alyssa Go was killed earlier this year.”

The man can be seen standing inches away from Yen’s camera as he says, “I believe they need to all die. I have the right to say that. I think all Asians should die.”

He went on to make xenophobic, racist remarks against Chinese people in America, questioning why they migrate to the United States. When Yen asked him the same question, he said, “I was born in this country,” to which Yen replied, “So was I. I was born in Saint Vincent’s down the street.”

 

In the second video posted by Yen, the man can be seen expressing concern about other passengers standing close to him before he turns back to the camera and states, “I’m racist. I’m proud about what I say, but I’m only racist towards Asians because they’re the worst thing. Why can’t you live freely in your own country and say what you want to say?”

 

He then argues with another Asian passenger on the subway and calls him “stupid” for claming, “I’m Asian, but I’m not from Asia,” to which Yen retorts that he is of Irish descent.

In the third video, some passengers can be seen surrounding Yen as the harasser continues to speak about China before he iss dragged out onto a subway station.

 

“This is not the first time this man has targeted Asians while I've been on the train,” Yen wrote in her caption. “I recognize him and I'm sure others do as well. However, this is the most interaction I've had with him and the first time other people have come to my defense when I was threatened or harassed on the train for racist reasons. Which I feel is worth mentioning, for all the good and bad implications attached.”

“Also it's worth mentioning that I told the arresting officers that this was a hate crime and I had footage of the incident and they brushed me off and walked away,” she added. “I wonder how many obvious hate crimes haven't been properly identified as such due to similar actions?”

As of this writing, no details regarding the unidentified man have been made available. NextShark has reached out to Yen for comment.

3/12/2022,"A former Texas elections administrator is accused of giving her employees colon cleanse and getting them to drink it under the guise that it was an energy drink. Denise Hernandez, who worked for Smith County, pleaded guilty March 9 to two counts of assault causing bodily injury stemming from the incident. She was arrested on June 1 after employees reported her actions to police, according to CBS19. . Employees supervised by Hernandez told police that on April 27, 2021, Hernandez, their supervisor, offered them a cup of pink liquid, which she told them was a Spark energy drink, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by McClatchy News. The employees each said they’d had the Spark drink before, and drank the liquid, the affidavit said. Hernandez left, and when she returned asked the employees if they’d finished their drinks before beginning to taunt them. “(Hernandez) then placed a canister of colon cleanse on the counter and started making fun of them for drinking the colon cleanse … and singing ‘You just drank colon cleanser’ in a childish manner,” the affidavit said. F.R. Files, Jr., the defense attorney for Hernandez, could not be reached for comment by McClatchy News. Colon cleanses are primarily used as prep for colonoscopies to empty out bowels, and “can sometimes be harmful” when used in other instances, according to the Mayo Clinic. The employees felt stomach pain due to the cleanse, were concerned about it due to prior medical conditions and felt embarrassed, according to the affidavit. “The act caused the pre-existing conditions of each victim to be amplified and caused them pain,” investigators said in the affidavit. One employee who drank the colon cleanse said she was “afraid to say anything because (Hernandez) was a bully and she did not want to lose her job.” Another employee who drank the cleanse said Hernandez frequently made fun of them and would “poke her breast,” according to the affidavit. Other employees who overheard Hernandez talk about spiking the drinks with the cleanse told investigators that they would also describe her as a bully, the affidavit said. Hernandez was sentenced to 18 months probation and 80 hours of community service. According to CBS19, Hernandez no longer works as an elections administrator. ‘Hostile work environment’ at Activision Blizzard led to employee suicide, lawsuit says Burger King employee was sexually harassed by her manager at work in NC, lawsuit says",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,"Boss spiked energy drink with colon cleanse and gave it to employees, Texas cops say",https://news.yahoo.com/boss-spiked-energy-drink-colon-234355812.html
