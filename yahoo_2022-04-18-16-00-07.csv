4/18/2022,"Elon Musk said in a video interview that he doesn't own a home and is ""staying at friends' places."" The world's richest man also doesn't own yachts or take vacations, but has a plane to save time. Musk was responding to a comment about how many people criticize billionaires for their wealth. The world's richest man said that he doesn't own a home and crashes on friends' couches. ""I don't even own a place right now, I'm literally staying at friends' places,"" Elon Musk said in a video interview published Monday with Chris Anderson, head of conference organizers TED. ""If I travel to the Bay Area, which is where most of Tesla's engineering is, I basically rotate through friends' spare bedrooms,"" Musk added. Musk, who has an estimated net worth of $251 billion according to Bloomberg, was responding to Anderson's comment that many are offended by the concept of billionaires, given global disparities in wealth. US lawmakers, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have also criticized mega-billionaires like Musk for their comparatively low tax bills. ""For sure, it would be very problematic if I was spending billions of dollars a year in personal consumption, but that is not the case,"" Musk told Anderson, adding that he doesn't own a yacht or really take vacations, though he famously does have a personal jet. ""It's not as though my personal consumption is high. I mean, the one exception is the plane, but if I don't use the plane then I have less hours to work,"" he said, acknowledging that his net wealth was nonetheless ""bonkers."" Musk's comments look like his first confirmation that he doesn't have a permanent home, despite being the world's richest person. The billionaire's friends have commented over the years on his thrifty habits. In May 2020, he tweeted his intention to sell all his possessions and that he would ""own no house."" In August 2021, Insider reported that Musk was thought to be living in a $50,000 prefab tiny home, which he rents from SpaceX. In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, Musk's on-again, off-again partner Grimes said he sometimes lived ""below the poverty line."" He refused to buy a new mattress after her side had a hole in it, she said. And in 2015, Google's cofounder and then-CEO Larry Page said that sometimes when Musk visited Silicon Valley, he would e-mail Page and say: ""I don't know where to stay tonight. Can I come over?"" Musk's pre-recorded interview comes after he spoke with Anderson live at a TED conference on April 15, and addressed the ongoing saga that is his attempted buyout of Twitter. Musk said that he had a backup plan in the event that Twitter rejects his $43 billion bid, but declined to share any details. During the live event, Musk said that it's possible he may not be able to acquire the company, but said he could ""technically"" afford it. ""I have sufficient assets,"" he said, without giving further details. Most of Musk's personal fortune is tied up in his stake in Tesla. Musk is in for a fight. On Friday, Twitter said it would adopt a ""poison pill"" defense. Insider's Gabrielle Bienasz reported that this ""essentially devalues each share in a company by increasing the total number of shares — making it harder for any person or group to acquire all of a company's stock."" In the pre-recorded interview, Anderson asked how upset Musk was with comments about him and other billionaires as being too wealthy. ""I mean, at this point, it's water off a duck's back,"" Musk said.

4/18/2022,"BEIRUT (AP) — During a visit to Syria in 2017, Vladimir Putin lavished praise on a Syrian general whose division played an instrumental role in defeating insurgents in the country’s long-running civil war. The Russian president told him his cooperation with Russian troops “will lead to great successes in the future.” Now members of Brig. Gen. Suheil al-Hassan’s division are among hundreds of Russian-trained Syrian fighters who have reportedly signed up to fight alongside Russian troops in Ukraine, including Syrian soldiers, former rebels and experienced fighters who fought for years against the Islamic State group in Syria’s desert. So far, only a small number appears to have arrived in Russia for military training ahead of deployment on the front lines. Although Kremlin officials boasted early in the war of more than 16,000 applications from the Middle East, U.S. officials and activists monitoring Syria say there have not yet been significant numbers of fighters from the region joining the war in Ukraine. Analysts, however, say this could change as Russia prepares for the next phase of the battle with a full-scale offensive in eastern Ukraine. They believe fighters from Syria are more likely to be deployed in coming weeks, especially after Putin named Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, who commanded the Russian military in Syria, as the new war commander in Ukraine. Though some question how effective Syrian fighters would be in Ukraine, they could be brought in if more forces are needed to besiege cities or to make up for rising casualties. Dvornikov is well acquainted with the multiple paramilitary forces in Syria trained by Russia while he oversaw the strategy of ruthlessly besieging and bombarding opposition-held cities in Syria into submission. “Russia is preparing for a greater battle” in Ukraine and Syrian fighters are likely to take part, said Ahmad Hamada, a Syrian army defector who is now a military analyst based in Turkey. Syria observers and activists say the Russians have been actively recruiting in Syria for the Ukraine war, particularly among Russian-trained combatants. Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, reported that so far about 40,000 people have registered -- 22,000 with the Russian military and about 18,000 with the Russian private contractor Wagner Group. Around 700 members of al-Hassan’s 25th Special Missions Forces Division, known in Syria as the “Tiger Force,” left Syria over the past weeks to fight along Russian forces, Abdurrahman said. The numbers could not be independently confirmed. Pro-government activists posted videos over the past two weeks on social media showing members of the Tiger Force performing military drills including parachuting from helicopters. Russian officers appeared in one of the videos advising the paratroopers inside a helicopter as al-Hassan praised the young men by tapping on their heads. It was not immediately clear if the videos were new. Abdurrahman said there are also volunteers from the Russian-trained 5th Division; the Baath brigades, which is the armed wing of Assad’s ruling Baath party; and the Palestinian Quds Brigade, made up of Palestinian refugees in Syria. All have fought alongside the Russian military in Syria’s war. “The Russians are looking for experienced fighters. They don’t want anyone who was not trained by the Russians,” Abdurrahman said. The Tiger Force took credit for some of the biggest government victories in the 11-year conflict. It was involved in a monthslong Russian-backed campaign into the rebels’ last enclave, located in the northwest province of Idlib, which ended in March 2020 with government forces capturing a vital north-south highway -- though rebels remain in control of the enclave. Al-Hassan “is one of Russia’s men and Russia will depend on him,” said Omar Abu Layla, a Europe-based activist who runs the DeirEzzor 24, a Syria war monitoring group. Hundreds of fighters from the 5th Division and the Quds Brigade have registered at Russia's Hmeimeem base in western Syria, which is leading recruitment efforts, and are waiting for orders, he said. In late March, a Russian-trained force known as the “ISIS Hunters” militia, which fought for years against IS, posted an ad calling on men aged 23 to 49 to come forward for screening, saying those who pass the test and are found suitable will be called on later. So far, about 100 men have registered their names in the southern province of Sweida, according to Rayan Maarouf of Suwayda24, an activist collective that covers IS activities in the Syrian desert. He added that they were promised a monthly income of no less than $600, a huge sum of money amid widespread unemployment and the crash of the Syrian pound. Earlier this month, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said the U.S. had indications that the Wagner Group is trying to recruit fighters, mostly from the Middle East, to deploy in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. But he said there has been “no specific information” on numbers recruited. “We just aren’t there yet to see anything real demonstrable when it comes to reinforcement,” he added. Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in early March that so far there are only “very small groups” trying to make their way from Syria to Ukraine, calling it a “very small trickle.” Retired Lebanese army general Naji Malaeb, who follows the war in Syria closely, said there is no indication so far of Syrian fighters traveling to Russia, but this could change as the war drags on. “This all depends on what the Russians plan to do in the near future,” Malaeb said. Syrian and Palestinian officials in Syria have played down reports of fighters heading to Ukraine. The Syrian government is likely wary of having Syrian fighters flock to Ukraine, opening opportunities at the front lines that its many opponents could exploit. In a potentially worrying sign for the Syrian government, Russia has significantly scaled down its operations in Syria since the war in Ukraine started, with fewer airstrikes targeting IS or opposition positions in Idlib. “Any change in the posture of Russian forces or pro-regime militias creates security gaps that anti-regime actors including Turkey, ISIS, al-Qaida and Syrian opposition groups can exploit,” the ISW report said. Muhannad Haj Ali, a former legislator and a commander with the armed wing of Syria’s ruling Baath party said no Syrians have gone to fight in Ukraine and that he didn’t expect any to go. He said he was certain Russia will win in Ukraine without any need for Syrians’ help. “The way the operations are going is clear indication that Ukraine will not be another Afghanistan,” he said.",World/Associated Press,Syrian fighters ready to join next phase of Ukraine war,https://news.yahoo.com/syrian-fighters-ready-join-next-055955874.html
4/18/2022,"A retiring Republican lawmaker says the extremist members of his party could make it difficult for the GOP to govern if they retake control of the House of Representatives in November with a slim majority. “It will be very hard to govern for Republicans if we’re under 230, knowing that we’ve got the MTG element that’s really not a part of a governing majority,” Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. Upton was referring to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a far-right conspiracy theorist who’s spoken at a white nationalist event and has a history of spreading racist and anti-Semitic talking points. While a party can control the House with 218 seats, Upton said the GOP would need at least 230 in order to cancel out Greene and those like her, who he noted were very popular in their home districts. “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd asked Upton what that said about the Republican Party today. “Troubled waters, I guess you could say,” he replied. Upton was among 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump over the Jan. 6 insurrection. He announced his retirement earlier this month after he was drawn into a new congressional district that would put him in a primary race with a GOP lawmaker endorsed by Trump. Upton, who was first elected in 1986, is a co-vice chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. Last year, Greene reportedly tried to launch a caucus to promote “uniquely Anglo-Saxon political traditions.” She backed off after criticism from within her own party. Although Greene lost her committee assignments due to her calls for violence against fellow lawmakers, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has already promised she will get them back if the GOP regains control in November.

4/18/2022,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi Monday warned that Israel will be targeted by his country's armed forces if it makes “the tiniest move” against Iran. He spoke as talks stalled in Vienna over a deal to rein in Iran's nuclear capabilities, which Tehran says are used for peaceful purposes. Israel opposes a deal, saying it does not do enough to curb Iran’s nuclear program or its military activities across the region. Israeli officials have said they will unilaterally do what’s necessary to protect their country. Raisi addressed Israel directly during a speech at an annual parade of Iran's armed forces. “If the tiniest move by you happens against nation of Iran, center of the Zionist regime will be destination of our armed forces,” Raisi said, referring to Tel Aviv. Raisi did not elaborate but said Iran watches any move by Israel “closely.” Iran has not recognized Israel since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted the pro-West monarchy and brought Islamists to power. It supports anti-Israeli militant groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Raisi said that Iran’s military power is a deterrent. He said army managed to improve its capabilities despite years of sanctions on the country over Tehran’s nuclear program. Monday's parade showcased jet fighters, helicopters, drones and air defense systems as well as military tanks, missiles and naval vessels. Israel in recent years improved relations with neighboring Arab nations in the Persian Gulf, which has angered Iran's leaders. Tehran also has blamed Israel for the sabotage of its nuclear sites and the assassinations of its nuclear scientists. The nuclear deal collapsed four years ago when former President Donald Trump withdrew the United States and imposed crushing sanctions on Iran. In the meantime, Iran has vastly expanded its nuclear work. U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe Iran had an organized military nuclear program until 2003. Iran insists its nuclear program has aimed at generating power and for medical purposes.",World/Associated Press,Tehran warns Israel on making 'tiniest move' against Iran,https://news.yahoo.com/tehran-warns-israel-making-tiniest-055207760.html
