3/13/2022,"Described as the proverbial six-pointer beforehand, it was Brentford who emerged to make capital on a nervy afternoon with Ivan Toney scoring two priceless, late goals, including one from the penalty spot. The forward netted a hat-trick last week at Norwich and his late header here dragged the Bees nine points above the danger zone. Hard-working Burnley were further condemned when Nathan Collins was ordered off for impeding Toney for the spot kick. Brentford were unchanged from their welcome 3-1 win at Norwich City last week, having lost nine of their previous 12 league games, while Burnley’s solitary alteration from the 4-0 home defeat against Chelsea was the return of Maxwel Cornet for Jay Rodriguez. The Clarets arrived in west London still minus influential skipper Ben Mee, out with a knee injury. Christian Eriksen, meanwhile, was making a first home start for the Bees, who lost the corresponding fixture at Turf Moor in October. Burnley made a bright start with Josh Brownhill curling a 20-yard free-kick inches past the post, before Brentford responded with Bryan Mbeumo needlessly clipping over when presented with a close-range opening. In the 15th minute, Eriksen, eagerly urged on by the home fans in his quest for a debut goal for the Bees, was expertly denied by Nick Pope after a tantalising shot from the edge of the penalty area. The opening spell ebbed and flowed, with Sean Dyche’s men abandoning caution and in an assertive mood. Cornet, an increasing concern for the hosts, subsequently outstripped Pontus Jansson to shoot an angled effort a yard wide, hinting at genuine promise for the Clarets. James Tarkowski, one-time Brentford defender, was a commanding presence, nullifying Mbeumo’s bursts from deep in addition to the ongoing threat of Toney. Indeed, he was sufficiently vigilant to turn a Mbeumo left-foot slice off the line, with Brentford finally reviving their initial buoyancy towards the end of the first half. The Bees forged an opportunity in the 52nd minute when playmaker Vitaly Janelt was furthest forward to uncharacteristically head the ball inches over via a precise Sergi Canos cross from the left. Thomas Frank’s team were too patient and anxious in possession at times against the increasingly organised Clarets, perhaps hoping that somehow, in Eriksen, they could conjure up a special moment to break the deadlock. Cornet nearly made capital on the counter-attack when, eluding Ethan Pinnock, his low drive was deflected away by the Bees’ keeper David Raya. Rodriguez, on as a substitute, then opted for the spectacular, crashing a long-range drive off the bar with 13 minutes to go. Fatigue looked like settling upon Brentford until Toney finally emerged. Sensing a gap at the far post, Eriksen found the striker with a pinpoint cross from the left. Toney headed back across goal into the corner of the net. His 10th league goal may well be enough to keep the Bees in the top flight. Collins then saw red as Toney stretched the Clarets, before the £12m man drilled past Pope in the last minute.

Encanto (Disney+) This is about a magical house that’s losing its powers, and Mirabel has to solve the mystery. What’s really interesting about it is that there is no love story. I’ve got a little girl and it’s lovely for her to grow up watching films where the woman isn’t always saved – it’s the other way around. When my daughter watched it she said: “Oh my God, Mum, she looks just like you.” She has big curly hair that grows up and out like mine. That for me was a moment, because very rarely do I watch something where someone looks like me. On Purpose I’ve been really getting into this over the past couple of months. In each episode, Jay Shetty talks about a particular topic: relationships, manifestation, how to make the most of your 2022. I particularly enjoyed the one on stress and anxiety. He has a very soothing nature – he used to be a monk, and he has taken those teachings into everyday life, which is a wonderful thing. As somebody who believes in God, to listen to someone like him who’s essentially taken the teachings of God to help us help ourselves – it really resonated with me. Everyone should listen to it. Finneas I didn’t know about Finneas, who is Billie Eilish’s brother and collaborator, until somebody on America’s Got Talent sang one of his songs. Break My Heart Again is my favourite song of his: he’s got a very distinctive voice, and the music is quite stripped back, no frills, so his voice and lyrics really shine through. I usually listen to music in the bath – that’s the only time I get to myself, even though there’s always somebody knocking, saying “Can I have this?” or “Do you know where that is?” So if I turn it up just loud enough, I can’t hear them and they can’t hear me. Untamed by Glennon Doyle (Vermilion)I just finished reading this memoir. It was recommended by Heather, my friend and makeup artist, who got it on the recommendation of Adele. I read the first two pages and it got me straight away: it’s a chapter about a cheetah in a cage, and about freedom – is the cheetah used to living in a cage, or does it look for freedom even though it has lived life in captivity? Each chapter is short, snappy and thought-provoking, and some stories really stop you in your tracks. Wordle I think everybody is on to this now. I’m not big on fads and trends but this one I quite like. At first I refrained from telling my husband, because he’s good at everything – I was like: “You can’t have this, this is my thing.” Then I put it on our family chat. So now every morning we all do our Wordle, including my 11-year-old, and we see who the winner is. It’s really addictive, and a good quick game to play first thing. It’s lovely to have something we all engage with. Hotel Chocolat cafes My husband and I go here all the time. It’s not fancy, but lots of people probably don’t know that Hotel Chocolat sometimes have cafes in them. They do the most amazing hot chocolate: it’s like a chocolate mousse, and they literally pile it so high you can’t see your face past the whippy chocolate stuff – it is absolutely delicious.

3/13/2022,"International Women’s Day Scala Radio, BBC Radio 3, BBC 6 MusicThe Last Bohemians House of HutchTonight With Andrew Marr LBC International Women’s Day last Tuesday, and radio stations filled the airwaves with music and interviews from “queens” and “trailblazers” and “inspirational” women; all great, but it does make me wonder about those of us who muddle along being not very magnificent at all. Women still have to be fantastic, even on IWD. It’s often said, but we’ll know we’re equal once a woman is allowed to be as mediocre at her job as a middle-aged white man. As for being rewarded with a knighthood for being sacked … nobody would want a world where that could happen. Oh. Anyway. Scala Radio, which always showcases an admirable amount of female composers and musicians, had a good week. Simon Mayo, a natural feminist ally, was as relaxed as ever, highlighting Dame Kiri Te Kanawa’s birthday; Penny Smith had an interview with the soprano Gabriella Di Laccio. The station has also brought back She Scores, the Sunday night show featuring female film, TV and video game composers. Radio 3, which also has a pretty good gender balance, went all out: premiering the lost 1583 madrigals of Maddalena Casulana, exploring sisters in Free Thinking, and showcasing female composers in a live lunchtime concert. This committed focus on women’s work in classical music is amazingly interesting. The station also made some lovely short videos that highlighted the various roles of women behind the scenes; encouraging stuff when we remember that just 10 years ago, only 1% of radio programme editors nationally were women. 6 Music has long had two women installed in the mornings, Lauren Laverne and Mary Anne Hobbs, both of whom regularly play music created by women; thus, despite the station’s promotion of International Women’s Day, both shows sounded as they always do – meaning as great as ever. Hobbs provided my full-on “Hooray, women are great!” moment, by playing PJ Harvey’s wild, hilarious 50ft Queenie straight into the mad scales of Anna Meredith’s Sawbones. Sometimes talk isn’t what’s needed, just an enormous shout at the sky. For something more intelligent than sky-shouting, you might try the first episode of series three of The Last Bohemians. Kate Hutchinson’s interview podcast is always worth a listen, and she kicks off with a doozy: the brilliant artist Maggi Hambling. Hambling, an iconoclast from her wild hair to her cigarette tip, is a quote machine and a hoot, and she did not disappoint. At one point her phone went off. Its ringtone was God Save the Queen, played on a trumpet. Hutchinson, who did well not to laugh, asked Hambling: “Are you a royalist, Maggi?” “Of course,” said Hambling airily, and immediately returned to her tales of “drugs, a lot of queer business”, debauchery and art. Like many older interviewees, she has a habit of repeating entertaining but well-worn anecdotes, but Hutchinson did well in pinning her down. When Hambling trotted out a familiar quote about her lover Henrietta Moraes – “I became her subject rather than she mine” – Hutchinson asked what she meant and got a touching story about Moraes’s death. We should all be more Hambling, I feel: saved by her work, full of doubt but continuing on. “I refuse to be told what to do,” she said. Amen. Over to LBC, which did nothing much at all for IWD (Shelagh Fogarty aside, its daytime hosts have long been resolutely male). On Monday, another chap – Andrew Marr – started his new one-hour evening show. It’s a strange one. Marr, who came to LBC with Rob Burley, exec editor of his old BBC TV programme, has simply transplanted a telly show on to the radio. If you watch it, he’s sitting at a semicircular table, giving his opening (Autocued) links straight down the barrel of a camera, cutting to footage of parliament or Ukraine. Fine: but many of us want to listen rather than watch, and Marr’s tone sounds manic to anyone expecting radio. TV is about broadcasting to the nation; radio is about talking to one person. Marr’s energy is a bit The Day Today for us listeners, and he sounds positively nuts when he throws to news or travel. A few other points. It’s ridiculous to invite on journalists of the calibre of fellow presenter Camilla Tominey (Monday) and Pippa Crerar (Tuesday) for the entire one-hour duration of the programme and only have them say a couple of things. The show is very politico-celeb heavy – Michael Gove first night, Jeremy Hunt the next – which adds status but not much warmth. No listeners call in, not even a tweet is read out. In short, it’s very old BBC, which clearly has its merits but comes as a shock after LBC’s daytime schedule. The station’s USP is feisty, informed, welcoming presenters who can keep to schedule while including listeners and never seeming frantic. Marr hasn’t yet acquired all of these attributes. His show feels alien, though it’s clearly meant to usher in LBC’s TV era; the brilliant Iain Dale, on after Marr, is now also hosting at the semicircular table and delivering some of his links to camera. Luckily, Dale is such a pro that you can’t notice this when you’re listening. Of course, Marr will settle into his new show, but there are already plenty of excellent radio presenters who do TV (Eddie Mair and James O’Brien come to mind), as LBC well knows. Victoria Derbyshire could do this show standing on her head, and involve the listeners too.",Arts/Television & radio,The week in audio: International Women’s Day; The Last Bohemians; Tonight With Andrew Marr,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/12/international-womens-day-scala-radio-bbc-radio-3-6-music-review-the-last-bohemians-maggi-hambling-kate-hutchinson-tonight-with-andrew-marr-lbc
3/13/2022,"Ukraine’s president. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, came under pressure to tackle corruption from the moment he was elected in April 2019. His government was on its knees financially after a series of scandals that had seen the country’s biggest bank collapse following allegations of looting. Soon after, it was nationalised. Most acutely, the International Monetary Fund, the US-based lender of last resort and the country’s main benefactor, was threatening to withdraw a $19bn funding package. In September 2019, Ron van Rooden, the fund’s mission chief for the country, said officials had found “shortcomings in the legal framework, pervasive corruption, and large parts of the economy dominated by inefficient state-owned enterprises or by oligarchs”. Zelenskiy promised to clean up the country’s public administration and satisfy the IMF that its money was safe in Ukraine. Last year, the Ukrainian parliament passed a law that targeted oligarchs. Zelenskiy said it would ensure the interests of society were served above those of a narrow elite of the rich and powerful. According to the legislation, Ukraine’s national security and defence council (NSDC) would make the final determination of whether an individual met the criteria of having significant economic or political influence in public life – in other words, whether or not they were an oligarch. To the Putin administration, all these moves were further evidence of Ukraine’s shift to the west: more transparency to end decades of oligarch domination that followed the end of communism. As we know, Putin wanted a client state, and that meant one run by his contacts among the billionaires. Meanwhile, there was an expectation inside Ukraine that the US and the EU would reward Zelenskiy’s efforts. And widespread confusion when this did not happen. However, there is little evidence that oligarchs have suffered under Zelenskiy. Certainly, the IMF has yet to get any of its money back, and critics of the anti-oligarch legislation said it handed the president more powers of patronage – especially in relation to the NSDC, which he can veto. Critics also say Zelenskiy has struggled to distance himself from the man the US accuses of looting the country’s biggest bank before it collapsed – Ihor Kolomoisky, often cited as Ukraine’s most powerful oligarch. It was Kolomoisky, the US says, who controlled PrivatBank when it was taken into public ownership in 2016 after an alleged fraud left $5.5bn missing from its balance sheet. In March last year, the Biden administration banned Kolomoisky and his family from entering the US over these allegations of “significant corruption”. Kolomoisky has always denied wrongdoing. The result of these developments for the war currently destroying his country is that Zelenskiy, by the time of the invasion, had changed Ukraine enough to anger Putin, but not enough to please his western allies. He was slow off the mark in 2019 to make reforms and still faces accusations that he depends on the kindness of oligarchs. His popularity slumped towards the end of last year and one reason was his perceived slowness in tackling corruption. Of course, the IMF is now providing funds to support the economy. It will give an update this week on its mission to save Ukraine. But there is a fear in Washington that once contracts are issued, IMF money will again disappear into the pockets of the rich and powerful. It is often said that these reforms – the anti-corruption laws among them, such as they are – have been foisted on Ukraine by western agencies, and the IMF in particular, as the price of successive bailouts. However, Ukraine, with huge bumps along the road, has been travelling a similar journey to Mexico, South Africa, Greece and Indonesia, to name just a few other states. Those electorates have voted in governments with a mission to tackle widespread and endemic corruption. The voters in question are the aspirational middle-income groups that are worst affected by it. They are the small business owners who must pay protection money, or the public officials who routinely take bribes, often just to make ends meet. Their children’s access to university is limited by their status. And if they do become affluent, they must live in gated compounds, with security to keep criminals at bay. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has faced criticism, like Zelenskiy, for taking his time bringing forward reforms. Last week he was congratulated for announcing a new chief justice and deputy that will give the judiciary a chance to assert its independence. Ramaphosa has many problems facing him as he seeks to rid the country of corruption, but he doesn’t have the world’s second most powerful military machine waiting on his border to invade should he begin to make progress.

3/13/2022,"The chemical engineer Robert Langer co-founded Covid-19 vaccine maker Moderna, and his innovations have helped create more than 100 products from artificial skin to messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. The 73-year-old has a mountain of research papers and patents to his name, on top of which he has started more than 40 companies and won more than 200 awards, including the Queen Elizabeth prize, which has been called the “Nobel for engineering”. Langer’s biomedical engineering lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he holds a professorship, employs more than 100 researchers. He spoke to the Observer to mark Unesco World Engineering Day for Sustainable Development, held earlier this month. Last year you debuted on Forbes magazine’s billionaires list. Being a co-founder of Moderna has been profitable! How did it feel?It’s embarrassing. Everybody sees it. I have never sold a Moderna share, so it’s not like I’m spending the money. But I never did any of this to get rich. I’ve never sought high paying jobs. All my life I’ve looked for things that I felt would make a difference. Did you think Moderna would be successful when you established it in 2010?The platform – mRNA-based medicines delivered to the body via nanoparticles – had revolutionary potential and, because of my work on the drug delivery of large molecules, I thought we could do it, even if others doubted. I remember telling my wife that I thought Moderna would be the most successful biotech company in history! Of course, the Covid-19 vaccine accelerated the company’s success, but we were only able to make it because of all the underlying technology we had already developed. You grew up in Albany, New York. Your dad ran a small liquor store and your mum took care of you and your sister. How did you get into chemical engineering?My parents bought me Gilbert hobby sets, including a chemistry one. I set up a little lab in our basement mixing chemicals and making the colours change and I loved it. In high school, though I liked chemistry, math was the only subject I did well in. I was advised to do engineering at college, and I listened. I did terribly in my first year at Cornell except in chemistry, so I decided I had better major in chemical engineering. You did your PhD in chemical engineering at MIT but you didn’t follow your classmates into high paying jobs in the oil industry…I had decided I wanted to use my chemical engineering to help people and so I declined the job offers. After many unanswered letters, I got a postdoctoral position doing cancer research. It was in the lab of Judah Folkman, a professor and surgeon at Boston children’s hospital, known for his unusual hires. It changed my life. I was the only engineer in the whole hospital. I started to think about how materials got into medicine. Doctors would use ladies’ girdle material for the basis of an artificial heart, and mattress stuffing for the basis of a breast implant. I thought: why not instead design the material you wanted from first principles. Both Moderna and Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccines are different to previous vaccines: they insert mRNA to teach our cells how to make a protein that triggers an immune response. What was your specific contribution to the technology?Being the first person to deliver nucleic acids like RNA and DNA to the body via tiny particles. Folkman had the idea that if you could stop blood vessel formation inside a tumour, that might be a new way to treat cancer. But to solve the problem we had to deliver large molecules to the body. Nobody before us had done that and we were told it was impossible: the molecules were too big to travel through any capsule or particle and too fragile to be placed inside them. But I made tiny particles – polymer capsules – that could deliver just about any protein or nucleic acid for a sustained period. We published the findings in 1976. People were sceptical at first – I couldn’t get grants or a position in an engineering department – but over time, scientists’ thinking changed: perhaps you could make other types of tiny particles and deliver other macromolecules [the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines use lipid nanoparticles for delivery]. The first blood vessel inhibitor to treat cancer, Avastin, was launched in 2004 by Genentech in part using techniques started in Folkman’s lab. Where else is drug delivery technology that you pioneered being used today?Lots of people have built on the work we started, coming up with different applications and improvements. Today injectable microparticles are used to treat mental health diseases such as schizophrenia and opioid addiction as well as type 2 diabetes and pain. Our work has been critical for drug-eluting stents. Nanoparticles are also being used to treat cancer and certain rare diseases. Moderna is developing mRNA medicines for a wide range of diseases beyond Covid-19. Clinical trials under way include a flu and an HIV vaccine. Are you expecting them to succeed and what are you most excited about?I expect a lot of them will, if not every single trial. And, over time, I expect you will see more success because there’ll be other companies too, and more trials. I’m excited about all these possible new treatments. If personalised cancer vaccines work, that’ll be a big deal. You are also a pioneer in the field of tissue engineering. What are some of the advances you have made there?In the early 1980s the surgeon Joseph Vacanti and I came up with the idea of making three-dimensional scaffolds that you could put different kinds of cell types on to make tissues and organs. Since then, my work has taken in lots of different tissues and organs: we’ve engineered blood vessels and created artificial skin for burn victims. We have also made new materials that cells adhere to better. Are the drug companies, including Moderna, doing enough to get Covid-19 vaccines to poorer nations? Covax, the global Covid-19 vaccines procurement initiative, has criticised the pharmaceutical companies for a “lack of sharing of licences, technology and know-how”.I believe that both the drug companies and the governments are doing the best they can. Certainly, the companies are expanding manufacturing capacity. Moderna announced this week it is working to set up a plant in Kenya. It also announced it is expanding its earlier patent pledge to not enforce its Covid-19-related patents during the coronavirus pandemic to now never enforcing them in low- and middle-income countries. Furthermore, the latest information is that the problem is not about having enough vaccines, it’s about being able to get them into people’s arms. It is a logistical challenge. The African Union recently declined an option to acquire 60m doses from Moderna. Moderna has also been in a patent dispute with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) over whether three NIH scientists should also be credited for finding the genetic sequence that is central to the vaccine. The company has backed down in the hopes of reaching an amicable resolution with the NIH, but will this ultimately end up in court?I don’t think so. Moderna has offered the NIH co-ownership of the patent. Moderna has always thought highly of working with the NIH, and I think also vice versa. We are still working together. The relationship has been a win for us both and for the world. How did you create a product that prevents hair frizz?In 2005 I agreed to get involved in starting Living Proof, a hair – and later skin care products – company. One aim was to prevent hair frizz. We took a fundamental look and found these polymers – already existing and approved for other uses – that were super water repellent. A second aim was to give hair more body. We repurposed polymers we had already developed that had led to some new gene therapy agents. Unilever bought the hair part of Living Proof in 2016 and we spun off the skin care part to Shiseido. What are you working on in your lab currently?One of the biggest areas of work is with the Gates Foundation on creating new technologies for the developing world. For example, on vaccines we are working on a new approach where you give just a single injection with nanoparticles or microparticles and it delivers the vaccine by popping at different months, so you get the boosters too. Our previous work on long-acting oral pills we have licensed to Lyndra Therapeutics [co-founded by Langer in 2015]. Going into clinical trials soon should be a malaria pill that can last for two weeks and a contraceptive pill designed to be given once a month. Separately in the lab, we continue to work on delivery systems to get different types of RNA and Crispr [gene editing] inside cells, and in tissue engineering we’re trying to create materials that don’t get fibrotic. Is engineering undervalued? How can it win more respect?It depends on the country, but science and engineering in general, certainly in the United States, doesn’t get as much status and respect as I’d like to see. I think it’s important to stress how much engineers can and have changed the world for the better. It’s a thrill for me to see engineering and biology improving people’s lives; that’s been my dream from the beginning. What’s your advice to young people interested in an engineering career?Shoot high and aim to solve big problems. It’s OK to take risks and it’s OK to fail. And diversity of any kind in your background is a plus. The more people come at things with different perspectives, the better for solving big problems. You are known for exercising a lot. What do you do to keep fit?Sadly my dad died of a heart attack at 61 and I have a tendency towards high cholesterol. I want to be here for my family and students. I walk, run and lift weights for probably two or three hours each day. But I multitask: the whole time we’ve been talking, I’ve been walking.

3/13/2022,"Imagine we were starting again. Imagine this was a world when professional sport was in its infancy and even the concept of a league was controversial in case it made people overprioritise winning. Imagine you had a vague sense the clubs in this new competition might represent their local areas, that they might come to fulfil some sort of community function. Who would you want running them? Would it be a fabulously rich Russian who made his fortune exploiting the economic chaos that followed a period of political turmoil to buy up his country’s oil and gas reserves and who was accused – although he strenuously denied it – of having close ties to that country’s autocratic leader? How about the investment fund of a Middle Eastern state that is engaged in a brutal war with one of its neighbours, the chair of which told the Atlantic this month that if he had ordered the murder of a journalist for a US newspaper, which he definitely didn’t because frankly this guy was small fry, his boys would have made a better job of it? Or what about an investment group run by another member of a Middle Eastern royal family, whose purpose in investing in the club was, as a Human Rights Watch report had it, to “construct a public relations image of a progressive, dynamic Gulf state, which deflects attention from what is really going on in the country”? Probably not. But then neither would it be a US family who saddled a club with £660m of debt as part of its takeover. Nor would it be a hedge fund that tried to trademark the name of the city and dabbled with destroying sporting structures stretching back more than a century for financial gain. You would probably rule out tax exiles, absentee businessmen and entrepreneurs with links to oligarchs as well. Take out the professional gamblers, one of whom was named in the Panama Papers, and we are left with a TV chef (One is Fun?) – and there’s at least a small caucus thoroughly bored by Norwich’s pedestrian yo-yoing between the Championship and the Premier League. Which brings us to a fundamental question: what is a good owner? For the most vocal, all that matters is how much money they spend. If there are any Chelsea fans who doubt Roman Abramovich has been a good owner they have been very quiet; the anger about the situation they find themselves in has been aimed at the government, not the former governor of Chukotka. But the sanctions are a result of the same forces that allowed Abramovich to loan Chelsea £1.5bn, apparently with no view to it being paid back. If you didn’t protest about the signing of Glen Johnson in 2003, can you really protest about the present restrictions? This is the deal clubs accept when they take the money. And while it’s certainly possible to sympathise with the fan who just wants to turn on the TV after a hard day’s work and watch their team or pop along to the Bridge and have a couple of pints without having to concern themselves with geopolitics, that feeling is strained by those who abuse MPs for raising questions about their owners on parliament or hound journalists (and, far worse, the widows of victims) for expressing concerns, or add the flags of authoritarian regimes to their Twitter bios. But was Abramovich a good owner even in football terms? Much will depend what happens next. It may be, if a sale is quickly agreed and the new owner is similarly generous, that he can be regarded as having not only brought five Premier Leagues and two Champions Leagues, but as having permanently raised Chelsea’s level from stylish pretenders to undoubted giants. It’s also possible, though, that he could become a luxury version of Sacha Gaydamak, under whom Portsmouth won the FA Cup but slipped into financial problems from which they are yet fully to emerge. If a good owner is not the bloke who gives you £1.5bn but might be sanctioned for being, as the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation had it, “involved in … undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,” who is it? Not a foreign state looking to improve its image, but also not a hedge fund or plutocrat whose only interest is financial profit. Which leaves what? A fan-made-good happy to give something back to their community? Some do exist, but their resources are necessarily limited – and the idea the gravel-voiced hauliers and scrap-metal merchants who owned clubs 60 years ago represents some sort of utopia is clearly flawed. That is the absurdity of modern football. The Premier League is the most popular league in the world; no league has generated so much income. More people watch football in England than ever before. Yet throughout the pyramid clubs are struggling, fans begging for sugar daddies. That is the consequence of the era the Abramovich takeover inaugurated, decoupling a club’s capacity to invest from the revenues it can raise itself. If we were starting again who would own clubs? It’s easy to talk of fan ownership, 50+1 and golden shares, but could modern fans be trusted not to roll over for the first billionaire to come promising to end what is preposterously described as their suffering, those unconscionable seasons of bobbing along in mid-table? Modern football is often beautiful, but structurally and morally the game is rotten. If we were starting again, it might be a very good thing.",Sport/Football,Roman Abramovich and Chelsea symbolise the rotten state of football | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/12/roman-abramovich-and-chelsea-symbolise-the-rotten-state-of-football
3/13/2022,"Ireceived a note the other day from Sally Lane, the mother of Jack Letts, the British teenager who went to Syria in his gap year and who remains uncontactable in a Kurdish prison camp, along with tens of thousands of others, suspected of involvement with Islamic State. Sally has written a book, Reasonable Cause to Suspect, about Jack’s five years of incarceration and the family’s efforts to have him freed to face justice at home. I met her a few years ago, with her husband, John Letts, and wrote about the trial in which the British government thought it worthwhile to prosecute them for “funding terrorism” (they had sent £223 to Jack, to buy a new pair of glasses and to try to find a way of getting back to the UK). She knows that there are plenty of people with little sympathy for her son, who was 18 when he went to Syria without their knowledge in 2014. Jack remains a symbol, however, of this government’s shameful unwillingness to confront the hardest of its responsibilities. Jack and Shamima Begum, the two highest profile prisoners, had their UK citizenship revoked in response to media outrage. Meanwhile, at least 300 other former IS volunteers were anonymously allowed back into Britain without sanction.

The list of likely buyers for Chelsea FC includes property developer Nick Candy. If that sale goes ahead, all proceeds should go to London’s world-leading fund in black irony. Candy and his brother cornered the market in oligarch-chic as far back as 2001, when they sold a £5m apartment in Belgrave Square to Boris Berezovsky, a former business partner of Roman Abramovich. The apartment, it was reported, came complete with “bullet-proof CCTV cameras, fingerprint entry systems and laser beam alarms that activated smoke bombs”. The last word in oligarch style was perfected by the Candys with their development at One Hyde Park, where Kazakh politicians and Nigerian oil billionaires competed to throw money at the most expensive real estate on the planet. In 2014, Ukrainians chose the building to protest outside because of resident Rinat Akhmetov’s links to the disgraced Yanukovych government. Plus ça change… On Wednesday, I went up to Edinburgh for the funeral of my old friend and Observer colleague Euan Ferguson. Euan’s life was all story and everyone had a dozen single malt anecdotes, but one that rang true for me came from his younger brother, Donald. He recalled how as boys he and Euan had been going together to visit their grandfather, who was in poor health after a stroke. “Let’s try to make him 100% happier!” Euan announced on the way. Donald did not know what a percentage was at the time, but the ambition was memorable enough to have stuck with him 50 years on. Euan had suffered grim health himself in the past decade after a stroke of his own, but as anyone who was lucky enough to share a bar-room table with him – or read one of his peerless opening paragraphs – knew, that generous determination to make the world around him not just a little bit jollier never left him. It remained true at the funeral; it was a horribly sad day but, even so, no one could think of Euan for 10 seconds without giving in to a smile.

3/13/2022,"After talking for about an hour about the car industry and her three years at the top of Stellantis in the UK, Alison Jones realises she hasn’t mentioned the small matter of the giant merger between Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler that created the company. “Yeah, we did that as well last year. I forgot,” she says with a burst of laughter, sitting in the boardroom at one of Stellantis’s technical centres in Coventry. It shows just how much she and other car company bosses in the UK have had on their plate. There was Brexit taking up much of 2019, she says, a pandemic in 2020, and unprecedented shortages of key computer chips in 2021, all of which should really have been decade-defining issues. Yet when people look back at what the 2020s meant for the car industry, the transition to electric vehicles will probably be seen as the dominant trend. “This is our way of being now,” says Jones. “You’re constantly looking to adapt to the next change, find your competitive advantage, and drive your competitive advantage.” The Stellantis office in Coventry (it still bears the PSA logo high up on its exterior) is airy and pleasant on a sunny afternoon, but it is also nearly empty, a reminder of the other changes the pandemic has wrought. Age 53 Family Married to Nic, three adult children in their early 20s: two have recently finished university, and the third is doing a placement year before a final year of studies. Education A-Levels at Wootton upper school, Bedfordshire, then evening classes for accountancy qualifications and a degree equivalent at the Chartered Management Institute. Pay “I’m not going to answer that!” Stellantis declined to identify which subsidiary employs her. Last holiday Antigua, in the Caribbean, with the family to celebrate husband’s 60th birthday. Best advice she’s been given “Persevere.” Biggest career mistake Not doing the right preparation for a job interview. “That sticks with me.” Word she overuses “Fantastic.” How she relaxes Spending time with the family and walking. “I stomp,” she says. “You have to get out in the fresh air.” During the interview we both wear masks, and there are still one-way systems around the building, following the same protocols as in the company’s shop floors. Jones’s responsibilities have grown in line with the ambitions of the parent company. She joined Stellantis’s forerunner, PSA Group, in February 2019 to be UK managing director for the Peugeot, Citroën and DS brands, and to finish off the integration of Vauxhall/Opel, bought in 2017. Then, in January last year she became managing director for Stellantis in the UK, adding oversight of brands including Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep following PSA’s merger with Fiat Chrysler. Then, at the end of 2021, the UK’s lobby group, the 82-year-old Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), made Jones its first female president – several decades late by the reckoning of many in the industry. Hers is a non-executive role, but carries political clout as champion for the UK car industry. “It was a proud moment,” she says. However, Jones’s career story is not one of lifelong love for the car industry. “I didn’t know what I wanted to be,” she says. She had “humble beginnings”, with her father a “working farmer, gentleman farmer” and her mother a part-time shop assistant. Her first job after A-levels in 1986 was with a television rentals company, where a manager suggested she keep studying to get an accountancy degree. Her first brush with the car industry came when she joined a Volkswagen finance team in Milton Keynes, but she soon jumped to a scientific instrument business in Cambridge, where she worked on exporting “dual use” products – items that can be used by civilians but could also be repurposed for the military. She then took a fleet management job before going back to Volkswagen. She ended up staying at the carmaker for 21 years, rising from sales director for Audi to running after-sales care for VW’s five mass-market brands (VW cars and vans, Audi, Seat and Skoda) in 800 UK locations. The business of selling cars is going through a period of massive upheaval, but Jones thinks there will still be a place for the car showroom – for people to make a purchase and for a place to go for help after the sale is complete. She acknowledges that the industry has long been very male-dominated, and lists the ways in which her company is committed to diversity. Then, unprompted, she details her dislike of equal representation quotas, a measure some campaigners believe is a useful way to force businesses to improve. “I hate quotas for women,” she says. “You should only ever get a job based on your credibility and your ability to do that job.” Her priority in the SMMT role is to keep pressure on the government to do its bit to speed the change to electric. The industry is braced for slowing vehicle sales as interest rates and the cost of living rise. The government cut back subsidies for battery-powered cars twice in 2021. In comparison with the lavish help other European governments offer, that was “disappointing”, says Jones, her frustration obvious even behind a mask. The EU industry also benefits from energy subsidies that are lacking in the UK. Another government decision she regretted was the ban on all fully petrol and diesel cars after 2030, announced in November 2020. The move was described as “brutal” by Jones’s group boss, Carlos Tavares, who hinted that it could threaten Stellantis’s Vauxhall plant in Ellesmere Port. The plant escaped the axe by investing in electric vans, but Jones stresses that the industry is still flying blind, with no guidance yet on which hybrids will be allowed for five years after 2030. “When you pull a date forward, what you are effectively doing is saying to customers that they’re going to have to pay more sooner,” she says. Installing charging points across the country is another part of the puzzle where the government needs to up its game. Buyers want electric cars, but chargers need to be so widely available that people don’t worry any more, Jones says. “It’s can I do it when I come home in the pouring rain on a Sunday night with no charge, my children in the back of the car and I’ve got to go to work in the morning?” she says. “If you can answer that question, you’ve got a solution.”",News/Business,‘You have to drive your competitive advantage’: Alison Jones of Stellantis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/12/you-have-to-drive-your-competitive-advantage-alison-jones-of-stellantis
3/13/2022,"Schools and parents can improve the social mobility of disadvantaged children by restricting access to smartphones, the chair of the government’s social mobility commission has said. Katharine Birbalsingh told the Association of School and College Leaders annual conference: “If we genuinely want things to be fairer, and we want our disadvantaged children to be socially mobile, the best thing I can do for them is getting them not to have a smartphone.” Birbalsingh described how her school – Michaela community school in London – encouraged pupils to hand in their mobile phones and video devices to the school for safekeeping in a “digital detox” programme. As a result, Birbalsingh said, half of the Year 11 pupils at Michaela had volunteered to give up their phones until sitting their GCSE exams later this year. “We work very hard with families to encourage them not to give [their children] a smartphone. Because all of the problems start on smartphones,” Birbalsingh told the conference. “We actually run digital detox with our children at school, meaning we have a big safe, and we strongly encourage them to give us their smartphones or the leads from their video games overnight. And if some of them will give them up for weeks if not months, you’re lucky. I’d say we’ve got about half of Year 11 phones right now, up until exams.” Birbalsingh was appointed in October last year as chair of the commission, with a remit to advise the government on the barriers to social mobility caused by regional disparities, employment and education. Speaking to the conference in Birmingham, Birbalsingh noted that it was 12 years since she spoke there to the Conservative party conference, where she made headlines with her comments on poor discipline within state schools. She said her commission was looking at how parents can be given better advice on how to raise their children, to overcome the early onset of disadvantage. “We’re looking, at the commission, at what families can do before they ever get to school. There are lots of families who don’t realise that they should talk to their toddlers,” Birbalsingh said. “Lots of families don’t do that because they don’t know. So I would very much want to try and make it so that families can find out that sort of thing, find out how much they should be reading to their child and so on.” Comparing parenting advice to the well-known message that a healthy diet includes five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, Birbalsingh said: “If I ever tweet about the sorts of things families should be doing at home, I will sometimes get a response of: ‘Well, that’s not my job to teach my child, that’s the job of the school.’ “And they don’t realise just how many families out there are teaching their children all the time and how their children are in competition with those other children. And that there are lots of children who start school and already know how to read or are certainly on the way to be able to read.” Asked about the government’s levelling up aim for 90% of children in England to meet expected standards in maths and literacy by 2030, Birbalsingh said: “Whether or not you’re going to get 90% of children meeting the literacy requirements by the time they get to secondary school, that’s a very nice idea but is it the case that we are actually going to do that?” She also told head teachers they should try to ignore much of the commentary coming from Ofsted and the Department for Education. “Just put the blinkers on and ignore it and just do what is right for your children and do what is right for your school,” she said.",News/Society,"Restrict phones to improve child social mobility in UK, says commission chair",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/12/restrict-phones-to-improve-child-social-mobility-in-uk-says-commission-chair
3/13/2022,"Vladimir Putin did not show a willingness to end the war with Ukraine during a call on Saturday with French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz, a French presidency official said. Scholz and Macron called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine during the 75-minute phone call with Russian president Vladimir Putin, a German government spokesman added. Their demand echoed a statement made by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, earlier on Saturday, who said negotiations must begin with a suspension of hostilities. The Kremlin readout of the call said Putin briefed Macron and Scholz about the state of play in negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv and responded to their concerns about the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. It did not mention a ceasefire and accused Ukraine of using civilians as human shields.The participants agreed to say nothing further about the substance of the phone call, according to the German spokesperson, who added: “The conversation is part of ongoing international efforts to end the war in Ukraine.” Crisis talks between Moscow and Kyiv, which had been conducted in person in Belarus, have continued via a video link, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday, according to the RIA news agency. Speaking at a news briefing, Zelenskiy said Ukrainian and Russian negotiating teams had started discussing concrete topics rather than exchanging ultimatums. Stating that about 1,300 Ukrainian troops had been killed since the invasion began, he claimed the conflict meant some small Ukrainian towns now no longer existed. Zelenskiy said Ukraine could not stop fighting but was upholding a ceasefire around an agreed “humanitarian corridor” out of the besieged southern port of Mariupol and called on Russia to do the same. He further suggested negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to end the war could be held in Jerusalem. He said he hoped the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, would have a “positive influence” on peace talks. Bennett visited Moscow on 5 March, spending three hours with Putin before travelling on to Berlin to brief Scholz. He has spoken to Zelenskiy on multiple occasions since.",News/World news,"Putin did not show willingness to end Ukraine war during call, French official says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/putin-did-not-show-willingness-to-end-ukraine-war-during-call-french-official-says
3/13/2022,"Lewis Hamilton has expressed his concern that he will not be able to compete for wins when the Formula One championship begins next weekend. The seven-time champion believes his Mercedes car is off the pace and that his team have considerable work to do if he is to challenge for a record eighth title. With the final test in Bahrain concluded before the country hosts the first race of the season, Hamilton was downbeat about his chances. “It’s too early to have those kind of thoughts about the world championship but at the moment I don’t think we will be competing for wins,” he said. “We are not the quickest. Ferrari look to be the fastest, and perhaps Red Bull and then maybe us, or McLaren. We are currently not at the top.” The Ferrari has been strong across testing, as has the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. Built to entirely new rules this season, there have been suggestions that Mercedes are hiding their car’s true form. Last year they appeared off the Red Bull pace in testing but emerged with a strong car that won the opening round. However, Hamilton insisted his team faced a serious challenge this time. “We are being told we are talking ourselves down, but it is a bit different this year,” he said. “We have far bigger challenges and they are not one-week turnarounds. They will take a little bit longer. I am told we have a considerable amount of pace to find.” Verstappen finished the final day quickest, in front of the Ferrari of Charles Leclerc. Hamilton was in 17th with his teammate George Russell in fourth.",Sport/Sport,‘We are not the quickest’: Lewis Hamilton plays down Mercedes hopes,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/12/we-are-not-the-quickest-lewis-hamilton-plays-down-mercedes-hopes
