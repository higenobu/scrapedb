4/5/2022,"YouTuber Brendan Jones, one half of the Goal Guys vlogging brother duo, underwent a body transformation last year which saw him lean down and get ripped in 100 days. Since then he has been able to maintain the results he achieved through diet and working out, and is now seeking ""incremental"" ways to continue to improve on his personal fitness. In a new video, he documents his experience of doing additional pushups, pullups and ab work every day for a period of 60 days to see what effect it has on his strength and body composition. On top of his regular training, Jones begins doing an extra 15-minute workout each morning comprising 3 sets of 15 pushups, 3 sets of 45-second core-activating planks, and 3 sets of 8 pullups. He also does left-handed band pulls to build some strength in that arm which will help add balance to his upper-body exercises. ""The one thing that's been kind of tough is motivating myself to get to the second workout in the evening, which is always the hardest workout of the day,"" he says. However, as he remains consistent in his training, Jones soon begins to see results, most notably in his increased upper-body strength: five weeks into the challenge, his ability to do ring muscleups has improved. ""I am just over halfway through and I already feel so much stronger, it is shocking,"" he says. ""When I started I was on 15 pushups, now I have moved that up to 4 sets of 20 and can do that comfortably. Pullups have progressed from 2 sets of 8 to 4 sets of 10... I've also realized I can use this high frequency training to focus on things like improving with my rings pullups, working on explosive pullups."" At the end of the 60 days, Jones has lost 4.5 pounds and his body fat has dropped from 18.2 to 14.8 percent. ""I feel like I'm really lean... This really paid off,"" he says. ""I'm genuinely surprised by how fast my body adapted and improved with this training.""

4/5/2022,"Beating the Monday blues will be especially trying for Google employees this week. Starting today, workers are required to come into company headquarters three times a week. But according to Laszlo Bock, former chief of Google human resources and current CEO of Humu, this hybrid model won’t be around much longer. Bock says that after three to five years of flexible work models and hybrid plans, the normal in-office schedule will prevail at Google—and beyond. He predicts this transition will happen over the next few years, telling Bloomberg it’s the “boil the frog method.” “The purpose of the ‘boil the frog method’ [is] to do it subtly and thereby avoid difficult questions and conflict,” Bock told Fortune. “But that’s not only bad for trust and morale, it’s also not the best thing for employees or for the company.” Bock said his research at Humu shows that the perfect mix of employee productivity and worker happiness is a 3+2 schedule, in which three days are spent in the office, and two are remote. This combination, he says, gives individuals the chance to build relationships in-office and work on individual tasks that are easier at home. But Bock says that executives are reluctant to accept permanent work-from-home models. This could be due to the large investment that companies make when buying luxury offices. But it could also have to do with management itself. “Most executives have been working in offices for 20 to 30 years, so it’s comfortable for them. It’s the environment in which they know how to lead,” he told Fortune. “They want to go back to what is familiar, and they believe their experience trumps what Humu’s science shows: A hybrid model is better for productivity and happiness than being in the office five days a week.” When the pandemic hit in 2020, many white-collar jobs shifted to remote work for safety reasons. The tech sector readily adapted to this new format, as many employees learned that they liked the flexibility that working from home afforded them. But a new wave of companies, including tech giants like Meta and Apple, are starting to try to coax (or summon) their workers back to their headquarters. While some studies have shown that this shift to virtual work does not lead to a lack of employee productivity, Bock tells Fortune that this research is missing the full story. “It’s true that total workforce productivity hasn’t changed, but workforce productivity per hour worked has dropped. People are working longer hours, taking fewer breaks, and working on weekends because it’s become impossible to turn off work.” He adds that there is an emotional toll to working isolated without any teammates or coworkers present. Bock said he thinks workers will likely begin to want to come into the office themselves when they see bosses giving more promotions and opportunities to staff who are in the building over those who work from home. The new power dynamic will likely force reluctant employees to get back to the office when trying to gain favor with their supervisors. Bosses looking to push their employees back to their headquarters should make sure that there are obvious benefits to coming into work. Whether that be providing in-person coaching opportunities or free lunches, Bock suggests that employers make the perks to working in the office clear. He also urges companies to ensure that their promises hold weight. “Many companies will promise a great in-office experience but will fail to deliver,” Bock said.

4/5/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, long an advocate of Western rapprochement with Russia, expressed regret for his earlier stance, saying his years of support for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline had been a clear mistake. Steinmeier, a Social Democrat who served as Foreign Minister under Chancellor Angela Merkel before being elevated to the presidency, said Russia's invasion of Ukraine meant he and others had to reckon honestly with what they had got wrong. ""My adherence to Nord Stream 2 was clearly a mistake,"" he said. ""We were sticking to a bridge in which Russia no longer believed and which other partners had warned us against."" Steinmeier was a prominent member of a wing of his Social Democratic Party, led by former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, that argued close economic ties to Russia were a way of anchoring it within a western-oriented global system. The now-cancelled Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which critics said would have weakened Ukraine by cutting it out of the energy transit business, was a centrepiece of that strategy. That has triggered a growing backlash, with critics on social media repeatedly tweeting past pictures of him affectionately embracing Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, while Ukraine's ambassador Andrij Melnyk has been outspoken in his criticism. When Steinmeier arranged a ""solidarity concert"" for Ukraine, Melnyk tweeted sarcastically that the only soloists appeared to be Russian. ""An affront,"" he wrote. ""Sorry, I'm not coming."" Germany's president is meant to be a unifying figure who stands above the cut and thrust of daily politics, one who enjoys the moral authority to exhort people to better behaviour. ""We failed to build a common European house,"" Steinmeier said. ""I did not believe Vladimir Putin would embrace his country's complete economic, political and moral ruin for the sake of his imperial madness,"" he added. ""In this, I, like others, was mistaken.""

4/5/2022,"White House chief of staff Ron Klain on Monday called out Sen. Ted Cruz. Cruz said SCOTUS nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson will be ""the most extreme"" justice in history. Klain responded by saying ""nothing"" in Jackson's record ""supports this assertion."" White House chief of staff Ron Klain on Monday called out Sen. Ted Cruz for the Texas Republican's comments about Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden's Supreme Court nominee. ""Nothing in Judge Jackson's record, experience, or temperament supports this assertion,"" Klain wrote on Twitter in response to a clip of Cruz claiming that Jackson would be the ""furthest left justice"" in the Supreme Court's 233-year history. Cruz, who's previously said he opposes Jackson and grilled her during her confirmation hearings, made the statement as the Senate Judiciary Committee met to consider Jackson's nomination on Monday. ""There have been 115 men and women who have served on the Supreme Court. If Judge Jackson is confirmed, I believe she will prove to be the most extreme and the furthest left justice ever to serve on the United States Supreme Court,"" Cruz said during the panel's hearing. Shortly afterward, Klain pushed back on the senator's accusations. Since Biden announced Jackson as his nominee late February, the White House has forcefully dismissed GOP criticisms of her and her record. Cruz, along with several other Republican senators, have alleged that Jackson is ""soft on crime"" because of her sentencing record on child-pornography cases while she served as a federal district judge. Republicans have seized on a handful of cases in which Jackson imposed shorter sentences than those recommended by the federal guidelines, claiming that she's lenient toward child-pornography offenders. Legal experts, however, have widely rejected the accusations as baseless, saying they lack key context and data that shows Jackson's record mirrors that of most federal judges and that the sentencing guidelines are outdated and overly severe. During the confirmation hearings, Cruz also pressed Jackson for her views on culture war issues, including critical race theory. Jackson repeatedly emphasized that critical race theory plays no part in her jurisprudence. A spokesperson for Cruz slammed Klain, telling Insider in a statement on Monday that the White House chief of staff ""is firing out tweets to distract from the fact that he is overseeing an administration that is flailing both domestically and internationally."" ""Judge Jackson has a disturbing record of being soft-on-crime, including handing down lenient sentences in child pornography cases below national averages,"" the spokesperson said. ""Judge Jackson has also embraced Critical Race Theory in formulating sentencing policy and refused to define what a 'woman' was during her confirmation hearing."" Jackson defended her record at her confirmation hearings, saying she decides cases from a ""neutral posture"" and ""without fear or favor."" She's received endorsements from top law-enforcement officials and organizations from across the country, which have rebuked the GOP accusations against her. Legal figures on the left and right have also supported Jackson's nomination, including both Democratic- and Republican-appointed judges. Cruz is widely considered a potential 2024 White House contender — should Donald Trump not run — and his criticism of Jackson during the confirmation hearings were seen in part as an appeal to likely voters in the next presidential race, Insider's Warren Rojas previously reported. The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on Jackson's nomination on Monday, which is expected to be tied 11-11. The move would force Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to invoke special procedures to push Jackson's nomination forward. Her final confirmation vote before the full Senate will likely take place later this week. If confirmed, Jackson would make history as the first Black woman on the Supreme Court. —Ronald Klain (@WHCOS) April 4, 2022 Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/INSIDER,White House chief of staff Ron Klain hits back at Sen.
