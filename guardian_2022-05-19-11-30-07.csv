5/19/2022,"Weekly $27 cash payments, fuel discounts and half-price public transport are among the short-term sweeteners offered up by New Zealand’s government in its latest budget, as it tries to juggle the cost-of-living crisis with big-ticket spending commitments, including $11.1bn of healthcare system reform and $2.9bn responding to the climate crisis. “While we know the current storm will pass, it is important we take the hard edges off,” prime minister Jacinda Ardern said in remarks accompanying the budget’s release. “The plan this year is to do two things,” Ardern said. To “ensure Aotearoa New Zealand’s economic and social security for generations to come … making us less vulnerable to external shocks,” and “cushion the impact of the inflation cycle on families”. It’s the latter that will draw many households’ attention. On budget morning, local headlines were dominated not by fiscal policy, but by cheddar cheese and frozen berries – reports on recent supermarket price-spikes topping the most-read. New Zealanders have been feeling the pinch on multiple fronts, with petrol prices passing $3 a litre, food prices up 6.4%, inflation at its highest in three decades, and April rents up 6.9% from 2021. Finance minister Grant Robertson announced more than $1bn for cost of living relief, including a weekly cash payment that will go out to nearly 2.1 million New Zealanders. The $814m relief package will be distributed for three months to those earning less than $70,000, at a rate of $27 per person a week, or about $350 in total. The government will also extend temporary steps it took earlier in the year: cutting 25c a litre fuel excise duty to try to counter petrol price increases, cutting road user charges, and extending the half-price public transport fares announced in April. “Eighty-one per cent of working age New Zealanders are now being supported through these cost of living pressures as a result of what we’ve done in this budget,” Grant Robertson said. Asked whether those payments amounted to a “short term sugar hit”, Robertson said they were a targeted approach – as opposed to broad-base tax cuts – which would not contribute to worsening inflation. Those short-term measures represent a concession from the government in a year in which it had hoped to focus on big ticket, far-horizon spending and securing Labour’s policy legacy after two tumultuous, pandemic-dominated years. After fighting its Covid fires, the 2022 budget represents a crucial opportunity to invest in the far longer term problems of emissions reduction, and a troubled health system. The overhaul of New Zealand’s health system was the other major headline item, with $3.1bn allocated over the next two years. The government had already committed to creating a new, centralised health system and doing away with the “postcode lottery” of uneven care it said was created by the current, district-based health board system. All in all, the budget outlined more than $13.2bn in health system investments over the next four years, which Robertson said was the largest ever investment in New Zealand’s health system. Health minister Andrew Little said $1.8bn would be committed this year to “clear the financial deck,” paying off past years’ health system deficits and launch two massive new national health entities – Health NZ and the Māori Health Authority. The Māori Health Authority, a new body set up to provide by-Māori, for-Māori services and try to address disparities in care, would receive only a tiny portion of overall funding, including $168m for commissioning services. Addressing the climate crisis was the other major spending line, with $2.9bn of climate investments in energy security and decarbonising transport. Those measures are part of a $4.5bn for a climate fund, announced earlier in the week, to try to drive a low-emissions economy and prepare the country for the effects of climate collapse. Spending on social issues spending like child poverty, mental health and homelessness – previously headline items for the Ardern government – took a lower rung. Around a billion dollars spread across an array of measures including clamping down on gangs, changing rules to increase the child support payments accessible by single parents, and funding services for family and sexual violence. $202mn was assigned to invest in the mental health system and addiction treatment. Some advocates and community providers will be disappointed that the social relief spending does not go further to reduce some of the deep-seated wealth and ethnicity inequities in New Zealand. The cost of living measures will be finished within three months, family violence and child poverty spending is minor, and the investment in Māori health services represents only a fraction of the overall health reform package. But Robertson was quick to emphasise that while the immediate demands of the Covid crisis were fading from view, it had only been replaced by new, international crises and pressures – most of which were not New Zealand-specific. “Budget 2022 is being delivered against the backdrop of a global inflation spike, with existing supply chain pressures being exacerbated by pressure on oil prices from the war in Ukraine. This will pass but we need to protect New Zealanders from the immediate impact.” “The last few years have been challenging for everyone,” Robertson said. “Some of those challenges are still with us.”",News/World news,New Zealand budget 2022: Ardern offers $1bn in sweeteners to tackle cost of living ‘storm’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/new-zealand-budget-2022-ardern-cost-of-living-storm-health-climate
5/19/2022,"Australia’s jobless rate remained steady at 3.9% in April, hovering at near half-century lows, as the economy added a small number of new jobs and employees worked longer hours. The nation’s unemployment rate last month was a seasonally adjusted 3.9%, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Thursday, compared to 3.9% for March which was revised down from 4%. The economy added about 4,000 jobs in a month disrupted by Easter. Some economists had predicted staff roles would have expanded by a net 30,000 with the jobless rate dropping to 3.8%. April's jobless rate came in at 3.9%, in line with a revised 3.9% figure for March, the ABS says. About 4000 new jobs added, or fewer than the 20-30,000 expected. #auspol #ausvotes pic.twitter.com/wwLMWM8PPe The “3.9% is the lowest the unemployment rate has been in the monthly survey,” Bjorn Jarvis, head of labour statistics at the ABS, said. “The last time the unemployment rate was lower than this was in August 1974, when the survey was quarterly.” In April, hours worked increased 1.3%, or 23m hours, to 1.833bn hours, while the participation rate that gauges the share of those of working age in the workforce or seeking jobs eased back o.1 percentage points to 66.3%. The labour market figures are the last major data to drop before the federal election on Saturday. The Coalition had hoped to be campaigning on a strong economy but unexpectedly high inflation prompted the Reserve Bank of Australia to lift its key interest rate for the first time in 11 years and Wednesday’s weak wage growth numbers complicated their pitch. The rising cost of living – including petrol prices creeping back above $2 a litre in cities despite the temporary halving of the fuel excise – has also taken some of the edge off a jobless figure not seen in Australia since the early 1970s. Declining unemployment rates have been common across most rich economies as soaring debt levels during the Covid pandemic fuelled rapid rebounds. The UK, US and New Zealand have jobless rates in the 3%-range, while Germany and Japan have 2%-plus. Prior to today’s numbers being released, NAB said with job vacancies and job ads still high, further gains were imminent. “We see unemployment reaching around 3.5% by around the middle of the year,” it said.",News/Business,Australia’s jobless rate at 50-year low of 3.9% but fewer positions added in April than predicted,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/australias-jobless-rate-at-50-year-low-of-39-but-fewer-positions-added-in-april-than-predicted
5/19/2022,"The major parties are often dismissed as being too similar, but if you’re wondering how to decide who to vote for in the 2022 Australian election, here are seven key issues where there are real policy differences between the two major political parties in Australia. Labor has promised registered nurses will be on site 24/7 in every residential aged care facility in the country. It will also mandate that every resident receives an average of 215 minutes of care per day, as recommended by the damning aged care royal commission. Labor has also pledged to back aged care workers’ case for a 25% pay rise in the Fair Work Commission and has promised to fund the outcome of the case. It has promised to improve the food delivered to residents of aged care facilities by developing and implementing mandatory nutrition standards, and will push for greater transparency and accountability in the sector by making providers report publicly what they are spending government money on. Since the royal commission, the Coalition has announced a five-year $19.1bn aged care plan, which includes a major boost to home care of 40,000 new home care packages. The package also includes a boost to respite services, 7,000 new personal care workers, and 48,000 new training places. Like Labor, it has pledged to support aged care workers in their bid for higher pay, but has stopped short of committing to fund the pay rise. The Coalition is also delivering bonuses of up to $800 for aged care staff and is spending $345m to embed pharmacy services in aged care facilities. The Coalition has already broken a 2019 promise to establish a federal anti-corruption commission. The model it proposed was widely condemned as weak, toothless and an effective shield for politicians. It allows no public hearings for government corruption, cannot take public tip-offs, has a widely criticised definition of corruption, is not retrospective, and cannot make findings of corruption. It requires suspicion that a criminal offence has occurred before commencing an investigation, a threshold which critics say is hugely prohibitive. The Coalition released an exposure draft but never tabled its legislation in parliament, blaming a lack of support from Labor. Labor, meanwhile, has promised to establish an integrity commission by the end of the year. It has not released a detailed blueprint of how its model would work, but its two-page statement of principles indicates it would have the “independence, resources and powers of a standing royal commission”. Labor’s model would be able to hold public hearings, take public tip-offs, investigate MPs and ministers with broad discretion, act retrospectively, and make findings of corruption. The Coalition’s childcare policy leans primarily on past action. In the 2021 budget, the government increased the subsidy for the second and subsequent children in care, and removed the annual cap that limited the subsidy a family earning over $190,000 could receive. These restrictions had acted as a disincentive for many women to return to work. The changes took effect in March this year. Analysts say the changes reduce, but don’t remove, those workforce disincentives. Labor’s policy goes further, increasing the maximum subsidies for the first and subsequent children in care and softening the income taper so households can earn more while receiving higher subsidies. The party also pledges to get the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to work out a way to regulate childcare prices, and the Productivity Commission to review the sector “with the aim of implementing a universal 90% subsidy for all families”. According to Grattan Institute analysis, the high cost to the commonwealth for the Labor scheme would likely be more than offset by the broadly increased workforce participation. Despite significant pressure, the Coalition has not increased the 2030 emissions reduction target (26-28% compared with 2005 levels) it set in 2015. It opposes requiring anyone to cut emissions. Instead, it says it will spend $22bn on low-emissions technology by 2030, focusing on six priority areas. More than half this funding just tops up the budgets of existing clean energy agencies. Budget papers suggested the annual allocation of climate spending is expected to decrease over the next four years and the $22bn includes support for gas, a fossil fuel. The Coalition has promised to reach net zero emissions by 2050, but the plan does not explain how the goal will be reached. It assumes new technology will become commercial at some point after 2030 and be adopted. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor has a 2030 plan and a more ambitious emissions target for that date – a 43% cut. Scientists say it is significantly better than the Coalition, but less than what is needed. The ALP says it would create a $20bn “rewiring the nation corporation” to accelerate the roll out of major transmission links – poles and wires, in simple terms – to connect new solar and wind farms and batteries to the grid. Its modelling suggests 82% of grid electricity would be from renewables by 2030. It is promising to work with industry to gradually reduce its emissions using an existing Coalition policy known as the safeguard mechanism. It says it would exempt electric vehicles from some taxes, spend more on EV charging stations than the Coalition and attempt to help build global action by bidding to co-host the annual UN climate summit with Pacific countries in 2024. Both parties would allow fossil fuel exports to continue while there is a market for Australian coal and gas. The Coalition left it until late in the campaign to drop its main housing policy, which appears to offer one of the bigger differences with Labor. Buyers would be able to tap their superannuation for as much as $50,000, or 40%, to assist with the purchase of a first home, provided they later repay their retirement fund. Over-55s would also be able to access a scheme now open to 65s-plus to tip as much as $600,000 into their super to encourage downsizing and add market supply.Critics, though, note younger buyers typically have little super and extra demand would nudge prices higher. Few people had taken up the downsizing plan that’s been in place since 2018. By contrast, Labor’s schemes are means-tested and include the “help to buy” plan that would see the government chip in as much as 40% of the price for a new home (30% for existing ones) for buyers with at least a 2% deposit. To the extent it pushes up prices, the policy has a sting, but with the program capped at 10,000 a year (compared with about 100,000 first homers entering the market) the issue may be its limited scope. A separate plan to create a $10bn Housing Australia Future Fund sounds grand but the 30,000 new social and affordable housing properties over five years is also modest. Senior Coalition MPs, including the prime minister, have said they do not support the key reform proposed in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which is to enshrine a voice to parliament in the constitution. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, has been attempting to develop a consensus position that could be progressed toward referendum, but any deviation from enshrining a voice has been roundly criticised by those supportive of the Uluru statement. He’s also attempted to progress a version of the voice under ordinary legislation, which has also been criticised as not conforming to the central demands of the Uluru dialogues. There are some outliers within the party. Labor has committed to implement the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full, including progressing a referendum to enshrine a voice to parliament in the constitution. It has also committed to establishing a Makarrata Commission, which it says will develop a national framework for treaty-making and support and fund local truth-telling efforts, in partnership with First Nations groups and local communities. There isn’t a lot of detail around this model but it may look to Victoria’s Yoorrook Justice Commission. Few significant reforms to health have been announced by either of the major parties, despite rising out-of-pocket health costs and pressure on emergency services and hospitals. Anthony Albanese has said he is prepared to sit down and work “constructively” with state premiers on the need for more hospital funding, but has ruled out making any grand funding promises before the election. Labor will fund 50 bulk-billed urgent care clinics, but some experts say this is too few and a short-term fix to a struggling health system. Ahead of the final week of the election campaign, Labor revealed the most significant health commitment made by either party to date; promising a $970m investment in primary health and a boost for infrastructure upgrades in GP practices. The Coalition announced a package to boost regional, rural and remote health, since matched by the opposition. Both parties will reduce the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme co-payment to bring down the cost of medicines. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president, Dr Karen Price, said until the opposition’s announcement, “we had not seen a commitment by either major party to meaningfully invest in general practice patient care”. But she said the Medicare rebate issue was still pressing. The health economist Prof Stephen Duckett said the health election policies of both parties had failed to mention “the elephant in the room – the continuing Covid pandemic”, saying funding for the pandemic’s ongoing impact was lacking.",News/Australia news,Who should I vote for?

5/19/2022,"Neon hair, heavy black lipstick, friends gathered around a table in leopard print and lace. Luo Yang’s portraits of young people offer a rare glimpse into modern culture in China. The Shanghai-based photographer says she was drawn to taking pictures as a way of recording emotions that rise up during adolescence. She has been documenting Chinese youth for more than a decade. “They live bravely and authentically under the limits of traditional culture,” she said in an email interview. Luo, now in her 30s, studied at the Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts in China, majoring in graphic design. Her acclaimed 2019 series Girls features portraits of young women which she says reflect the “shifting mindset” on ideas of femininity and identity in China. “The feelings I express are the authentic inner feelings of women,” she says. “I’ve learned that so many inspiring, interesting and brave women are living [as] themselves … independent, brave and free.” After Girls came the series Youth, a collection of men and women in China born in the late nineties and 2000s. She describes the work as an objective record of a younger generation. The group, she says, was more “sex and rock’n’roll than K-pop” and contrasts to the “sanitised image conveyed by the pop stars adored by young people in China today”. “It’s a generation I don’t know much about so I use the creation of the series as a process to observe and understand their lives,” she says of the series, which was shot between 2019 and 2021. The award-winning photographer has had solo shows in Paris, Berlin, Austria, Hong Kong and Bangkok. This month Luo will showcase some of her work in Melbourne, Australia, as part of the Photo 2022 exhibition. Elias Redstone, artistic director of Photo 2022 exhibition, says Luo’s work “celebrates individuality” and the spirit of being alive. “It is great to see this kind of freedom come from a Chinese artist. While her subjects are in China the emotions, the fashions, the desire to be yourself is a universal impulse. Luo Yang’s work is incredibly assured, refined and connects with youth culture globally.” Redstone says Luo, along with the late Ren Hang, is part of a group of artists that has emerged over the last decade seeking to push beyond traditional depictions of life and people in China. “These photographers are looking to break the stereotypical images that often get represented in the West and often taken from an outsiders’ perspective,” he says. “They are reclaiming their own narrative … there’s a dose of sexuality and liberation thrown in and it’s wonderful to see.” Luo is busy working on her next project which she describes as “more relevant to my own living status and my growth”. “I’ve wanted to focus on the people who face similar problems [or] dilemmas.” She expects the project will be released this year and may see a departure from her use of film. “I’m also exploring more in the field of moving image, after all movies are something I love greatly too.”",Arts/Art and design,Photographer Luo Yang captures rare glimpse of China’s ‘brave and free’ youth,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/19/photographer-luo-yang-captures-rare-glimpse-of-chinas-brave-and-free-youth
5/19/2022,"Labor has promised a multicultural review as part of a series of measures to address the gaps diverse communities face in accessing federal government services. Senator Katy Gallagher and the shadow minister for multicultural affairs, Andrew Giles, said the pandemic had highlighted the problems diverse communities face. “Australians from Cald [culturally and linguistically diverse] backgrounds are worse off under Scott Morrison, because it’s harder to access support and services they need,” Gallagher and Giles said in the statement. “There have been consistent failures in translations of vital health information, while the government’s business support has often been inaccessible to new and emerging migrant groups. “The fragmented and inconsistent approach to engaging with Cald communities has had devastating consequences for individuals, communities, and small businesses.” Labor says it will also develop a whole-of-government standard for measuring Australia’s diversity, to better inform policy development. The measures will also include an expansion of the availability of multilingual frontline staff, to provide more culturally appropriate health services. The Coalition has pledged $5m to “multicultural and religious community groups” to improve safety at places of worship. They have also pledged to invest $17.8m in mental health services for multicultural communities. It comes nearly a year on from the Delta coronavirus outbreak in New South Wales, that resulted in many of the most diverse local government areas in Sydney going into lockdown. Military personnel were deployed amid tough limits on movement, exercise, masks and shopping in some of the most diverse areas in Australia. The chief executive of the Federation of Ethnic Communities’ Councils of Australia (FECCA), Mohammad Al-Khafaji said the heavy-handed approach toward diverse communities exposed “holes” in the government’s approach. “The pandemic, and the lockdowns in particular, exposed numerous holes in the government’s approach to engaging with multicultural communities,” he said. “Overall, it became clear that the needs of culturally and linguistically diverse people in Australia were mostly an afterthought when designing and implementing services and programs.” “We saw constant errors in translations, but even worse, we saw that translating existing information was the beginning and the end of many engagement strategies. Despite making up around half of the population, engaging with multicultural communities always seemed to be an afterthought or a nice-to-have.”’ Al-Khafaji backed Labor’s plan for a multicultural framework review, saying it was “long overdue” and that multicultural communication strategies were also due for reform. He said adding multilingual frontline workers should only be the beginning, saying such strategies should apply to all levels of government. “FECCA hopes that any such policy goes beyond just frontline staff and includes strategies for more culturally diverse staff at all levels of government services, agencies, and departments. “We want to see multicultural and multilingual people making decisions and designing services, not just delivering them.”",News/Australia news,Labor aims to improve delivery of federal services to diverse communities,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/labor-aims-to-improve-delivery-of-federal-services-to-diverse-communities
