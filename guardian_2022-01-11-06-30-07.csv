1/11/2022,"Michael Gove is the government’s go-to man to put in charge of departments that are seen to be underperforming and need shaking up. Primarily because he’s moderately more competent – a low bar – and better at appearing to get things done than most other ministers. And departments didn’t come more comatose than housing and communities under the hopeless Robert Jenrick. So, at the last reshuffle the Govester was brought in and told to give the levelling up agenda a bit of a boost while he was about it. Since then, Gove has kept a relatively low profile, conveniently absenting himself from the limelight as other ministers were forced to defend Boris Johnson’s many missteps over his running of Downing Street and the country. But on Monday he was forced out in to the open for the first time in months to deal with growing criticism from both sides of the house about the government’s handling of the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy.  First to be calmed down was the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, who was upset that government policy had yet again been pre-briefed to the media. It was a complete outrage, said Gove, coming on all ever so ’umble Uriah Heep. He had no idea how he had come to leak the announcement he was about to make to the BBC, ITV and Sky during the morning’s media round. It was a complete mystery. But there would be all hell to pay when he caught up with the Michael Gove who had done it. And he could promise the speaker he would set up an inquiry to investigate it immediately. With Hoyle more or less placated, Gove moved on to the substance of the statement. It had been a huge failure of government not to offer financial protections sooner to leaseholders living in buildings more than 11 metres tall. So he was now making it clear that leaseholders would no longer have to pay to make their own buildings safe by removing flammable cladding. Instead the burden would shift to the manufacturers of substandard cladding and the developers who had used it. And if they didn’t play ball, then the government would rope in all developers and get them to pay. And if that didn’t work he would get the money by taxing the developers. Or something. Labour’s Lisa Nandy, shadow secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, was not entirely convinced. Gove’s reputation for unctuousness – he’s the master of sincere insincerity – and telling people what they wanted to hear preceded him and she just wanted to check one or two details. The chances of the greedy developers agreeing to cough up speedily was about nil, she reckoned. After all, why bother to pay when, by delaying, you could reduce your liability by getting some of the decent developers to share the burden of costs? And then it would surely be only a matter of time before you were forced to threaten taxation, as no developer who had gone to the trouble of using the more expensive fire-retardant cladding would want to fork out extra to bail out others who had got the work done on the cheap. Nor would anyone want to pay for developers who had subsequently gone into liquidation. As for the tax rises, it didn’t seem as if the Treasury was entirely on board with the scheme. So was Gove saying the money would come from his department’s own budget as a last resort? Like most things Gove announced, it sounded entirely plausible until you examined the details up close. “Trust me,” oozed the Govester. Nandy was right to be sceptical as it had taken the government the best part of five years to make this much progress, he said, but everything was going to be just fine. Leaseholders would not even have to pay for non-cladding costs. It would just take a bit of time to iron out some of the creases in his plan. He begged her for patience, while praising her infinite wisdom and assuring her that all would be for the best, in the best of all possible worlds. Jenrick then chipped in to recommend Gove’s measures. Something that provoked shrieks of derision from the Labour benches and open-mouthed disbelief from his own. After all, Honest Bob had always appeared more than happy to let leaseholders pay when he had been the secretary of state. He said he was sorry the chancellor hadn’t been so accommodating when he had been in charge of the department. There again, he’d probably never really forced the issue, his main achievement while in post being to facilitate Richard “Dirty” Desmond – who had previously paid £12,000 to attend a Tory fundraising dinner – swerving a £45m tax bill on his development project. The man sure knows how to shape a deal. Now, now, said Mikey. Don’t be beastly, everyone. He knew how hard Jenrick had worked to get leaseholders to pay out. And besides, it probably hadn’t occurred to Honest Bob that it was possible to get the government to do a reverse ferret on cladding. After all, it was only the entire House of Commons that was pointing out how slow the government had been to get a grip of the situation. Gove could have spent the rest of the session highlighting his own brilliance. But he preferred that to be left implicit. Instead, he devoted his time to praising MPs from all parties for their wisdom in asking questions of such intelligence and insight. It’s been a while since a government minister has said that to Jeremy Corbyn and the former Labour leader appeared taken slightly taken aback. Tory Nick Fletcher was so amazed to find someone prepared to listen to him, he forgot to ask a question. Yet for all the schmoozing and charm, there were still question marks about just how effective the plan would be. Even Mikey, the master of misplaced self-confidence, appeared to have his doubts, saying he “didn’t want to overpromise”, he “would have to look at it carefully” and he “would return to the house with more details before Easter”. For now, all he had managed was to buy a bit of time. But in a crisis like this, it was all that was required.

1/11/2022,"Fresh doubt has been cast on European fixtures involving English clubs playing in France this week amid fears strict travel rules could wreak more havoc on the Champions and Challenge Cups. Newcastle are due to play in France on Friday, as are Bath and Sale at the weekend, and while the organisers, European Professional Club Rugby, said last week that all fixtures will go ahead as planned, the key stumbling block is that clubs must isolate for 48 hours upon arrival before their matches, according to current travel rules. On Monday night officials were lobbying the French authorities through the Ligue Nationale de Rugby to relax that rule. But if the 48-hour isolation ruling remains, those fixtures would be cast into considerable doubt with the English clubs harbouring concerns over travelling.  Newcastle’s encounter with Biarritz in the Challenge Cup being on Friday means the issue is all the more pressing for Dean Richards, who voiced his concerns after Saturday’s defeat by Northampton. Sale, meanwhile, have already raised the prospect of not travelling to Clermont for Sunday’s Champions Cup match with their director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, expressing fears that his South African players would not be granted the necessary visas in time. Bath, who face La Rochelle in the Champions Cup on Saturday, were similarly in limbo on Monday night. EPCR has stressed that clubs will be able to train during the 48-hour period, but there are fears among the English clubs over the need to produce a negative test to leave isolation, which in turn raises the possibility that members of the travelling party could be stranded in France. Newcastle’s situation is all the more complicated because they are also due to play away to Toulon on Saturday 22 January. EPCR had said all matches would go ahead as planned after revealing the French government had given teams permission to travel “in pursuit of economic activity”. That appeared to avoid a repeat of the seven cancelled in December but hopes of avoiding another decimated round of fixtures appear to hinge on whether the French government is willing to drop its 48-hour requirements. “We’re not sure where we stand with it all and to be honest I’m not sure if we can go,” said Richards. “There has so far been no relaxation from the French government regarding the 48-hour isolation requirement and it’s very much up in the air. We just don’t know where we stand.”",Sport/Sport,French quarantine rules could disrupt Champions and Challenge Cup fixtures,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/10/french-quarantine-rules-could-disrupt-champions-and-challenge-cup-fixtures
