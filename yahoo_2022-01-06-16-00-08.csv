1/6/2022,"A jury last week convicted Jeffrey Epstein associated Ghislaine Maxwell of sex trafficking. Two jurors this week admitted to sharing their own experiences of sexual abuse during deliberations. Experts called the comments ""an absolute disaster"" and said it's very likely the case gets retried. Eight days after Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty of sex trafficking, two jurors in the case told media outlets that they may have swayed the jury by sharing their own experiences of sexual abuse during deliberations — revelations that could jeopardize the entire trial. Maxwell, a British socialite and longtime associate of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, was convicted on five of the six counts against her on December 29 after five days of deliberation. A juror, Scotty David, identified only by his first and middle names, told The Independent and Reuters that he used his personal experience of abuse to assuage doubts other jurors had about some of the accusers' testimonies. A second juror told The New York Times they also shared a personal experience of sexual abuse that ""appeared to help shape the jury's discussions."" Prosecutors filed a letter Wednesday requesting an inquiry into the remarks, Insider's Michelle Mark reported. Shortly after, Maxwell's attorneys filed two letters requesting a new trial. Attorneys told Insider that the jurors' remarks to the media were devastating for the prosecution and could likely mean the case would need to be retried. ""This is the absolute last thing you want when you get a guilty verdict,"" Neama Rahmani, the president of West Coast Trial Lawyers and a former federal prosecutor, told Insider. ""You don't want the jurors talking to the media. You don't want them saying something that will result in a mistrial."" ""It's an absolute disaster,"" he said. ""This entire conviction may get tossed, and we may have to retry the case."" Rahmani explained that the jurors' comments pose two potential issues: perjury, or lying under oath, and prejudice, or a preconceived opinion that may have improperly swayed the jury. Court documents showed jurors were asked during the selection process if they or anyone in their families were victims of sexual abuse. David told Reuters he ""flew through"" the questionnaire and did not remember if he was asked about personal experiences of sexual abuse, but said he would have answered honestly. If he had answered affirmatively, however, it's doubtful the defense would've permitted him as a juror. ""If the defense knew about it, they would've dismissed him,"" Matthew Barhoma, a criminal-appeals lawyer in Los Angeles, told Insider. He agreed it appeared ""very likely"" the case would be retried. During jury selection, attorneys go to great lengths to avoid selecting someone who will be biased, especially in cases as notorious as Maxwell's. Barhoma said he did not want to accuse the juror of lying but said there are two reasons a person may lie during jury selection. ""Jurors will lie to get on a jury for two reasons: if the case is notorious, and if they have been victims of the same allegations and they want to convict,"" he said. Rahmani said it also appeared to him that David may have lied during jury selection, citing the fact that the defense attorneys wouldn't have approved of him, as well as how the prosecutors reacted to his comments to the media. Prosecutors requested an inquiry because they have an ethical duty to flag to the court concerns of possible prejudice, Rahmani said. However, they also took the unusual step of requesting David be appointed an attorney. ""Jurors say and do all sorts of things that are inappropriate or improper, but they don't get appointed an attorney,"" he said. The fact that prosecutors think David needs an attorney suggests they believe he may have acted criminally by committing perjury. Another critical factor that could help Maxwell is that both jurors said they believed their comments helped convince the jury to deliver a guilty verdict. ""If he lied, and if what he told the media was accurate, that he used his own experience to convince the jury to convict, you have perjury and prejudice,"" Rahmani said. David told Reuters and The Independent that several jurors had doubts about some of the Maxwell accusers' stories. He said he discussed his own experiences to show that memories of sexual abuse can be clear in some aspects and hazy in others. ""I know what happened when I was sexually abused. I remember the color of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video,"" David told The Independent. ""But I can't remember all the details. There are some things that run together."" After sharing that, he added, some jurors ""were able to come around on the memory aspect of the sexual abuse."" Jurors often draw on their personal experiences during deliberations, according to Rahmani, and are free to discuss their past when doing so. It would only be an issue if David failed to disclose the sexual abuse on the selection questionnaire. If it wasn't, as Rahmani believes is likely the case, and David did sway the other jurors to convict, that would mean his comments caused actual harm to Maxwell, which is needed to prove prejudice. Prosecutors may argue the comments did not impact the verdict and that the jury would have voted to convict regardless, but that contradicts David's claims. Barhoma agreed that David's comments about persuading others are especially damning. ""If I was the defense team, I would be taking these quotes right out of Reuters,"" he said. ""It's saved by the media for Maxwell,"" he added. ""Had he not went off blabbing his mouth to reporters, we may never have uncovered it."" Have a news tip?

1/6/2022,"By Duncan Miriri NAIROBI (Reuters) -China's foreign minister began a visit to Kenya on Wednesday, where the government has relied on Chinese loans to develop infrastructure but faces criticism over the resulting debt burden. The Kenyan foreign ministry described the visit by Wang Yi, who is also state councillor, as ""historic"". It said security, health, climate change and green technology transfer would be discussed and new bilateral agreements would be signed. Kenya is the second of three stops on Wang's African tour, after Eritrea and before Comoros. Eritrea joined Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a long-term plan to fund and build infrastructure linking China to the rest of the world, in November. China has lent African countries billions of dollars as part of the BRI, including $5 billion for the construction of a modern railway from the Kenyan port of Mombasa. That model has been evolving, partly under the strain of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout and partly because of a backlash from African critics against rising debt levels. China is shifting from hard infrastructure loans to efforts to boost trade. Among critics of Kenya's reliance on Chinese funding is Kimani Ichung'wah, a ruling party lawmaker who has become a critic of the government. ""It is a debt trap and they should start renegotiating,"" he told Reuters before Wang's visit, complaining that the interest rates on Chinese loans was exorbitant. Ichung'wah is backing William Ruto, estranged deputy to President Uhuru Kenyatta, to take over the presidency in an election scheduled for August, and said that if Ruto won his government would seek new terms for the loan repayments. Eritrea, one of the poorest and most isolated nations in the world, is involved in the conflict in Tigray in northern Ethiopia that has destabilised the Horn of Africa region. Lina Benabdallah, an expert on China-Africa relations at Wake Forest University in the United States, said Wang's visit signalled Beijing's interest in restoring stability to the Horn and in improving access to Africa via Eritrea's Red Sea ports. Peter Kagwanja, a professor of international relations at the University of Nairobi, said the Comoros stop was also likely linked to trade interests. The Indian Ocean archipelago sits on the rim of a maritime trade route known in China as the Maritime Silk Road and considered strategically important by Beijing, he said.

1/6/2022,"Peter Navarro says former Pence hung up on him while he was pitching a plan to overturn the 2020 election. Navarro says he and Steve Bannon concocted a peaceful way to overturn the election on January 6. The former White House trade policy advisor says he didn't know if Trump was aware of his plan. Former White House advisor Peter Navarro says former Vice President Mike Pence hung up on him as Navarro was pitching him on a plan to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Congress. In his new book ""On Trump Time,"" the former White House trade policy advisor says he and Steve Bannon concocted a plan called ""The Green Bay Sweep"" to overturn former President Donald Trump's election loss on the joint session of Congress to count the Electoral College votes on January 6, 2021. Under the ""Green Bay Sweep,"" Republicans would object to the counting of electoral votes in six states that voted for President Joe Biden, resulting in up to 24 hours of nationally-televised debate. The ultimate victory, in Navarro's telling, would be for Pence to ""send"" slates of electors back to the states (which legal scholars said he did not have the power to do) and for those states to ""withdraw"" their electoral votes for Biden, making it so that neither candidate had a majority of electoral votes and the election would be decided by the House of Representatives. But the whole plan relied on Pence's cooperation — and the former VP wasn't willing to play ball. ""When I was in the Oval briefing the president on the results, I expressed frustration with the fact that Mike wouldn't return my calls. And that it would be useful, as we were moving to Jan 6, if that problem could be fixed,"" Navarro said in an interview with Rolling Stone. ""He said, yeah, he'd have Mike call me. Which Mike, in fact, did. The only problem was he hung up before he even spoke to me."" Pence and his staff rebuffed multiple outside pitches, including from legal scholar John Eastman and Trump campaign lawyer Jenna Ellis, arguing that Pence, in his ceremonial role overseeing the electoral count, had the legal authority to unilaterally reject states' certified slates of electoral votes. Navarro blamed Pence's former chief of staff Marc Short and former chief counsel Gregory Jacob for foiling the plan. ""Short and Jacob were just bad people. Just bad people,"" Navarro told Rolling Stone. ""Had no business being in the in the White House. They weren't Trump people. They were just bad people. They hurt the president in a lot of different ways, not the least of which is how they handled this particular issue we're talking about."" Short, who later called Eastman's analysis ""boneheaded,"" drafted Jacob to conduct legal research and present their own memo to refute Eastman's argument. The morning of January 6, Pence published some of Jacob's analysis in a memo to members of Congress explaining that while he would allow members of Congress to raise objections to electoral votes, he did not have the power to reverse the election outcome. Navarro is eager to take credit for the ""Green Bay Sweep"" and cast himself as the architect of a brilliant plot to overturn the results of the 2020 election — one he says would have gone off without a hitch if a violent mob of rioters hadn't disrupted the plan. ""I'd love to know how that violence erupted. I'm telling you I was one of the most crestfallen people on the planet at the end, when that happened, because I knew immediately: This won't end way the we wanted it to,"" Navarro told Rolling Stone. But the former trade advisor admitted in the Rolling Stone interview that he didn't know whether Trump was even aware of the plan. ""I don't know that for a fact,"" Navarro told Rolling Stone when asked if anyone had directly briefed Trump on the scheme.
