4/25/2022,"British universities are facing a brain drain as the row over Brexit in Northern Ireland threatens £250m in research funding from the EU, it has emerged. The European Research Council (ERC) has written to 98 scientists and academics who were recently approved for €172m (£145m) in grants telling them that if the UK’s associate membership of the €80bn Horizon Europe programme is not ratified they will not be eligible to draw down the money. Scientists have said they are now scrambling to find alternate EU institutions to host the funding, with some already turning down the ERC money and hoping the UK government’s promise of replacement cash will be delivered. But they say in either case it is “devastating” as the ERC is considered one of the most prestigious programmes in the world. Getting an ERC grant is “a badge of honour for any researcher and a signal of world-class leading research” that is a big draw for talent from the US and elsewhere, said Ethan Ilzetzki, an associate professor in economics at the London School of Economics. “Higher education institutions on the continent are salivating at the prospect of poaching this talent … higher education will be hurt for years to come if this isn’t resolved,” he said. The then Brexit secretary David Frost fought hard to get associate membership of Horizon Europe as part of the trade deal negotiations in 2020 but ratification has been delayed while the UK fails to implement the Northern Ireland protocol. UK scientists say they are being punished. Payam Gammage, a scientist at the Beatson Institute at Glasgow University, said: “It is a strange choice for the EU. The UK isn’t going to notice it immediately. It will take a long time to have any impact. All that happens is a bunch of scientists have a lot of opportunities taken away, or their lives just made a lot more difficult. We’re the only victims.” Gammage was awarded €2m to expand research on mitochondrial genetics and mutations in tumours, but has decided to turn down the ERC grant and apply for replacement funding from the UK Research and Innovation fund. He said this was not the same as there was no detail about the terms and conditions of funding. “The idea that the UK could replicate the system and apparatus of something like the ERC in the near to medium term is, at best, unrealistic,” Gammage said. Thiemo Fetzer, a professor of economics at Warwick University who was approved for €1.5m of funding, said: “We all had reason to believe that the UK association was just a matter of the UK implementing the free trade agreement. Now we are waking up to the reality. It is very devastating.” A molecular biologist who was awarded €2m for a five-year research programme said she would now be looking to commute to Ireland or Belgium. “My main priority is getting the funding because an award at this level of funding happens once in a lifetime,” she said. Starter grants are worth €1.5m each and consolidator grants are worth up to €2m each, with a further round of advanced grants due to be awarded next month worth up to €2.5m each, which could take the overall UK funding to about €300m. The science minister, George Freeman, has pledged to extend the guaranteed replacement funding until December 2022. The ERC president, Prof Maria Leptin, said she was “fervently hoping” that the UK-EU negotiations would be finalised and “result in association” with Horizon Europe. “Our letters to grantees had to point out the option for portability of the grant outside the UK, but nobody here has any wish at all to entice anyone to leave the UK,” she said. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the delay in ratification was causing “uncertainty for researchers, businesses and innovators based in the UK, and [has] been detrimentally affecting important collaborations between the UK and European partners.”",News/Education,Brexit row threatens £250m in UK research funding from EU,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/25/brexit-row-threatens-250m-in-uk-research-funding-from-eu
4/25/2022,"Boris Johnson belongs in a Bombay film. In a photo from his recent India visit he’s pictured leaning out of the cab of a yellow excavator in a JCB factory with all the swagger of Shammi Kapoor hanging out of a moving train in the 1962 classic film Professor. There’s the same pudgy flair, the same willingness to be ridiculous in the cause of charm, and the same blithe disregard for time and place. The day before Johnson landed in Ahmedabad, seven of these JCB diggers had been used to raze Muslim shops and homes, and the gate of a mosque in New Dehli’s Jahangirpuri area, in defiance of a supreme court stay on demolition. The municipality that ordered the demolitions was run by the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), and the brazen disregard of the apex court’s orders seemed almost staged for television. Johnson’s schedulers should have known better. Even if they were ambushed by the New Delhi demolitions that happened the day before he arrived, they should have known that bulldozing Muslim homes and livelihoods had become government policy in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh weeks before his visit. Demolition had become a form of violent gaslighting: regular communal violence instigated by anti-Muslim mobs is followed by the official targeted demolition of allegedly illegal Muslim property as punishment, turning victims into perpetrators. There was every incentive for the BJP to let Johnson do a commercial for the diggers that had just been used to show Muslims their place in Modi’s India, but why would Johnson play along? Like the hero in a vintage Hindi film, Johnson thinks of other countries as outdoor locations where he can play at being a statesman, not as real places with politics of their own. Just as Kapoor and Sharmila Tagore could move from Tower Bridge in London to tulip gardens to the Pont des Arts in Paris in the space of a single song, Johnson doesn’t really care if the foreign tableaux he visits feature an embattled hero such as Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a malevolent huckster like Donald Trump or a Muslim-baiting nationalist like Modi. He’s happy to shimmy for the cameras as long as the other face in the frame is a marquee name. All heads of government use foreign visits to burnish their images, but Johnson feeds off the charisma of populist leaders to an unusual degree. This instinct to inflate himself by sidling up to powerful men was on full display in India. Asked by journalists if he would raise the demolition controversy with Modi, he produced an equivocal answer that ended with the all-purifying invocation of India’s status as the world’s largest democracy. It’s understandable that a British prime minister looking for a trade deal and India’s support in Ukraine would avoid confrontation. But there is a line between diplomatic deflection and cheerleading, and Johnson crosses it every time because his super power is ingratiation. It would be a mistake, though, to make British foreign policy an extension of Johnson’s character; that inverts the relationship. Johnson is Britain’s prime minister because he embodies the post-imperial enabler role that Britain has adopted as its own on the world stage over the past 25 years. It was Tony Blair, a prime minister credited with more gravitas than Johnson, who invented that role by studiously playing sidekick to George Bush. In a multipolar world, where Britain, detached from the EU, sees being Singapore-on-Thames as the summit of its ambition, opportunities to play second or even third fiddle abound. In this world, Johnson is the perfect prime minister. In his book, Butler to the World, Oliver Bullough explained how Britain, post-Suez, made up for the loss of imperial power by using its financial and legal infrastructure to make itself the offshoring capital of the world, the launderer of the world’s dirty money. Johnson’s diplomacy reproduces this butler role in the realm of geopolitics. Its hallmark is the ability to follow the lead of the US regardless of consequence. This produces rewards such as the Aukus security pact; it also produces a necessary blindness to the politics of countries outside western alliances. Johnson’s inability to see that he was legitimising majoritarian violence in India with his photo ops and glib exonerations is a function of the enabler’s lack of agency. Atop the digger, he was doing no more than playing the role that Britain had made its own: “an attendant lord, one that will do, to swell a progress, start a scene or two”.

4/25/2022,"Optimism among UK manufacturers has fallen at its sharpest pace since the first coronavirus pandemic lockdown two years ago as firms struggle to cope with the fastest increase in their costs since 1975, according to the latest industry health check. With the war in Ukraine giving a fresh upward twist to the pressures on companies, the April industrial trends survey from the employers’ organisation the CBI found firms cutting back on investment and planning to pass on higher costs to consumers. Manufacturing output and order books continued to grow despite the worsening inflationary backdrop but at a slower pace than in recent months, the CBI said. The survey showed the balance of firms whose costs increased – the number reporting a rise minus the number reporting a drop – stood at 87 percentage points in April. That was only slightly below the record of +88 points in July 1975, when UK inflation was running at more than 20%. Dearer raw materials and energy resulted in the fastest average price increases (+60 points) since 1979, with a further acceleration in price growth expected in the next three months. The CBI said the downward trend in optimism among manufacturers had continued. A year ago, when the UK was emerging from the early 2021 lockdown, firms upbeat about the outlook outweighed those gloomy by a balance of +38 percentage points. By October that had dropped to +2 points as supply chain shortages pushed up prices. The figure now stands at -34 points. Anna Leach, the CBI deputy chief economist, said: “Manufacturing orders and output continue to grow, albeit at slower rates. But the war in Ukraine is exacerbating the Covid-related supply crunch, with cost increases and concerns over the availability of raw materials at their highest since the mid-1970s. It is little wonder that sentiment has deteriorated sharply over the past three months and manufacturers are now scaling back their investment plans. “The government must look again at near-term support measures to help firms through this crisis. An immediate priority should be to provide cashflow support for those struggling with wholesale energy costs via the recovery loan scheme, while cutting bills for energy intensive industries can help maintain UK competitiveness.” Samuel Tombs, a UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “Given emerging evidence that demand is faltering in response to hefty price rises, manufacturers are understandably pessimistic about the outlook; the business optimism balance dropped to -34 in the second quarter from -9 in the first quarter. “The employment and investment intentions balances also weakened in the second quarter, though they remained above their long-run averages. We think manufacturers are right to be relatively downbeat about the outlook and expect production to flatline over the rest of this year.”",News/Business,Optimism falls as UK factories hit by fastest rise in costs since 1975,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/25/optimism-falls-as-uk-factories-hit-by-fastest-rise-in-costs-since-1975-cbi
4/25/2022,"Hong Kong’s Foreign Correspondent’s Club has scrapped its annual human rights press awards just days before it was due to announce winners, out of fear it would violate the city’s wide-ranging national security law. The decision sparked a number of resignations from the club’s press freedom committee, and public criticism from journalists and former award winners, who described the move as sad, and evidence that it could no longer serve in its mission to defend the press. The FCC’s president, Keith Richburg, told its members in an email on Monday that the club was “suspending” the award pending further review. “Over the last two years, journalists in Hong Kong have been operating under new ‘red lines’ on what is and is not permissible, but there remain significant areas of uncertainty and we do not wish unintentionally to violate the law,” it said. “This was a very tough decision to reach. We explored a variety of other options, but could not find a feasible way forward.” The FCC board held a meeting on Saturday, where the question of suspension was put forward, the Guardian understands, and some members shared legal advice they had obtained which said the club and individuals related to it would be at risk of being investigated by national security police if the awards went ahead. A majority of board members voted in favour of a suspension. The national security law was imposed by Beijing in June 2020 following pro-democracy protests and criminalises what it terms acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. Hong Kong authorities have launched a comprehensive crackdown on the city’s once-free media in the two years since. Several major titles have been shuttered, journalists arrested, correspondents denied visas, and public broadcasters muzzled. A widely documented chilling effect has left the remaining media in fear of persecution and sources too afraid to speak on the record. The Guardian also understands there was extensive discussion at the FCC board’s Saturday meeting of the club’s dual roles to support foreign correspondents in Hong Kong and as a business that operates a social venue in the city with more than 100 employees and a large number of non-journalist associate members. Following a meeting of the club’s press freedom committee the next day, several members announced their resignation from the committee over the decision. The Washington Post’s bureau chief, Shibani Mahtani, a member of press freedom committee for three years and also a board member, urged club members and others who benefited from it to “take a long hard look at the club they pay to belong to”. “As a former winner and judge of the HRPA, I feel nothing but the deepest regret and do not stand by this decision,” she said, adding that the award was meaningful not just to Hong Kong journalists but those covering stories across the region, including in Afghanistan. “[The suspension] is emblematic too of the self-censorship many institutions feel forced to subject themselves to in today’s Hong Kong, whether with or without their merits, and entirely indicative of how the national security law has changed the landscape for all,” she said. “I have strongly recommended to the FCC president and its current board that we should seriously rethink the role of the press freedom committee, and the club as a whole. I believe it is no longer able to serve its core mission: to defend and promote the press.” Some Hong Kong journalists lamented the decision as sad but unsurprising. Timothy McLaughlin, a contributing writer to the Atlantic and former HRPA winner, said he was sad and angered to see the award cancelled. McLaughlin also noted it appeared the FCC had recently removed a statement of its “core mission” from the front page of its website. Sum Lok-kei, an independent Hong Kong journalist who has reported for the Guardian, described the decision as self censorship and “an insult to the outlets [and] journalists that still work in HK, especially outlets which officials have named [or] sent letters to before”. In its statement, the FCC said the decision “in no way reflects the FCC board’s view of the content of any of the entries or the work of the independent judges”. “The FCC intends to continue promoting press freedom in Hong Kong, while recognising that recent developments might also require changes to our approach.” The awards were due to be announced on world press freedom day, on 3 May.",News/World news,Hong Kong’s Human Rights Press Awards scrapped over security law fears,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/hong-kong-human-rights-press-awards-foreign-correspondents-club-scrapped-security-law-fears
4/25/2022,"“She’s like the Michelangelo of sex, drugs and rock’n’roll,” Pamela Des Barres once said of her friend and peer in penis admiration, Cynthia Albritton. Better known as Cynthia Plaster Caster, the 74-year-old artist died last week after battling a long illness. She was one of the last living “supergroupies” of the 60s and 70s US music scene, who built a reputation on their famous bonks and tell-all tales. But Albritton went a step further, casting the privates of the musicians she admired and flipping the notion of woman as muse. “She’s the most notorious groupie of all of them because of her art form,” said Des Barres. Albritton was born in Chicago in 1947 and discovered the power of plaster casting in her art class at the University of Illinois. When her teacher suggested that she could cast anything solid that could “retain its shape”, the shy but mischievous Albritton immediately thought of erect members, which would then conveniently go flaccid and avoid getting stuck in her moulds. She left home at 19 and teamed up with a younger friend, Dianne, who she had met at the Rolling Stones’ hotel in 1965. They called themselves “the Plaster Casters of Chicago” and set about breaking moulds of their own. The two became notorious thanks to Rolling Stone magazine’s 1969 “groupie issue”, which profiled top shaggers like Des Barres, Miss Mercy, Trixie Merkin and a number of others that rocker Frank Zappa had assembled in a girl-band called the GTOs. Albritton was never ashamed of the term “groupie” – which characterised fans, and not the rock stars who willingly slept with them, as being loose – yet she also wanted to be different. It was plaster casting, she decided, that would make them stand out. She and Dianne dreamed of one day having their own exhibition – although Dianne dropped out of casting soon after. Jimi Hendrix was Albritton’s first celeb client – and her best, she and Des Barres agreed in the 2010 VH1 documentary Let’s Spend the Night Together. “He was really laid back, relaxed, very quiet in the mould,” said Albritton, even though “his pubes got stuck.” He was also surely an impetus for vainglorious rock stars to attempt to one-up him by submitting themselves for casting. Among his successors were Jello Biafra, formerly of Dead Kennedys, Buzzcocks’ Pete Shelley, Television’s Richard Lloyd and MC5’s Wayne Kramer. There were, inevitably, mishaps. Peter Tork of the Monkees “didn’t get a chance to penetrate the mould”, Albritton once explained, so his cast comes up rather, er, short. As did Wayne Kramer from MC5: he encountered a premature plaster mix which, as Albritton put it in the Chicago Reader in 2002, “set before he could push his dick all the way into the mould – only the head got in. In this way, Albritton’s art became a challenge, a knowing dare that might expose a certain male vulnerability. “I was shocked and delighted to find that they were as insecure as I was,” she has said of her subjects. Zappa was among their biggest champions and wanted to give the Plaster Casters of Chicago their first exhibition. But a show never materialised. After an attempted burglary at Albritton’s apartment, Zappa’s manager Herb Cohen suggested keeping the casts in a vault in Zappa’s house for safekeeping. But he refused to give them back and in 1993, the same year Zappa died, Albritton went to court to retrieve them: she got back all but three, and it’s not clear which celebrity dongs have been lost to rock lore. But Albritton wouldn’t just cast anybody – not even Kiss, who wrote their 1977 song Plaster Caster about her. Sometimes, she would immortalise the musicians she slept with and get to “take home the world’s best groupie souvenir,” she once said – but only if she loved their music. In this way, she could be viewed as a tastemaker, especially at a time when women had little other agency in a male-dominated music industry. By all accounts, she considered her casts a “lasting monument” to the art of others. Not everyone agreed. In the 2001 documentary Plaster Caster, the writer Camille Paglia describes how “feminists of the time took a very dim view of what she was doing … they assumed it was degrading”. And in the 1970 film Groupies, a snide member of the band Ten Years After can be seen mocking Albritton’s work and calling it “pathetic”; we also hear that members of Led Zeppelin once threw her into a swimming pool fully clothed. Female music fans were often treated with disregard, but in casting, Albritton was assuming a position of control, as well as asserting her own sexuality. Like many aspects of 60s and 70s rock’n’roll, Albritton’s occupation is just one of many things you can’t imagine happening now. As the musician Ian Svenonius says in the Plaster Caster film, “all taboos have been crossed except for the penis is still unseen. I think most heterosexual men have only seen their own penis at this point.” Her work feels emblematic of the freedom of the era, concerned with that most elusive of things these days: having a laugh. In later years, Albritton levelled the playing field and turned her talents to breasts, which she hung on the wall of her Chicago apartment – Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ Karen O and Stereolab’s Laetitia Sadier among them. And in 2000, Albritton’s dream came true, and she was granted an exhibition in New York. While it’s unclear what will happen to her palace of phallus now she has died, she leaves behind a striking legacy: to quite literally grab life by the balls while you can.",Arts/Music,Cynthia Plaster Caster: the artist whose rock star penis sculptures asked big questions about manhood​,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/25/cynthia-plaster-caster-the-artist-whose-rock-star-penis-sculptures-asked-big-questions-about-manhood
4/25/2022,"Marine Le Pen may have lost to Emmanuel Macron in the French presidential election, but the far-right candidate finished far ahead of the incumbent in some of France’s overseas territories, doubling or in some cases even trebling her vote share. In the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique and in French Guiana, the National Rally leader scored 69.6%, 60.8% and 60.7% respectively. She also won in the Indian Ocean constituencies of Mayotte (59.1%) and Réunion (59.5%). Le Pen went out of her way to mention overseas voters on Sunday night, thanking in particular “our compatriots in the overseas territories who placed me first with an extraordinary force. This forgotten France, we will not forget.” The far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon had finished a comfortable first in most of the overseas territories in the first round, and the scale of Le Pen’s victories there on Sunday took many analysts by surprise. “I was expecting the gap to narrow, not a complete inversion of the scores,” Justin Daniel, a political scientist at the University of the Antilles, told Le Parisien, adding that Mélenchon’s high first-round score showed the final result was “above all a protest vote against Macron rather than a vote for Le Pen”. But Yvan Combeau, a historian at the University of Réunion, said Le Pen’s scores reflected a sustained drive for votes by the far-right party in the overseas territories, where social deprivation is significantly higher than on the mainland. “This was more than just a punishment vote,” Combeau told the paper. “It shows a degree of genuine adherence to the discourse and positions that are the hallmark of the National Rally, particularly around social questions such as the cost of living, wages and housing.” The division between the mainland and the overseas départements and territories was most marked during the pandemic, with fierce resistance to vaccination in the latter leading to rates sometimes less than half those in the former. Macron’s decision to mandate jabs for healthcare, transport and emergency service workers, and France’s health pass – requiring proof of vaccination, recovery or a negative test to visit cafes, restaurants, cinemas and other public venues – was deeply unpopular, leading to violent demonstrations and the deployment of extra police. Olivier Serva, a Guadeloupe MP, said last year that the situation on the island was “quasi-insurrectional” and reflected “weakening state authority”, while Maité Hubert M’Toumo, a trade unionist, said the protests “express the depth of suffering, inequality, poverty and exclusion felt by the people”. Patricia Braflan-Trobo, a professional mediator and sociologist in Guadeloupe, told Le Monde she was “sickened” by the result, saying that what “triumphed here last night were the conspiracy theorists and the anti-vaxxers … I am convinced French Caribbean citizens do not support the National Rally’s positions.” Marie-Luce Penchard, a centre-right politician and former minister from the island, said the government’s overall record in the overseas territories was good but there had been “strategic errors” and a “lack of compassion” on the part of the Macron administration. “We no longer know how to talk to our overseas citizens,” she said.",News/World news,French election: why did Le Pen do so well in overseas territories?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/le-pen-thanks-forgotten-france-after-election-gains-in-overseas-territories
4/25/2022,"The Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion has had repercussions far beyond that country’s borders, prompting urgent reconsideration of everything from energy policy to authoritarianism to European history. For me, it’s also been a crash course in the heroic, as we watch Ukrainians risk and sometimes lose their lives to defend their country, their homes, their principles, their rights and their future. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was much admired for refusing to leave Kyiv as the Russian army marched toward it, but ordinary people have also demonstrated courage, defiance and commitment. Often they did so with wit and panache, as with the Ukrainian sailor’s famous “Russian warship, go fuck yourself” reply to a demand to surrender. People studied first aid, made molotov cocktails, joined the resistance, helped neighbors and strangers. While millions have fled the country, the great majority of Ukrainians remain, some of them sheltered by strangers in safer parts of the country, some taking refuge in basements and, in Kyiv, subways and bomb shelters. Maryna Hanitska, the new director of the Borodyanka Psychoneurological Nursing Home, stayed with the facility’s residents for the weeks during which Russian soldiers pointed guns in her face, the buildings lost heat, water and power, and some died of the cold and used her hidden mobile phone to send information to the Ukrainian military. The journalist Nadezhda Sukhorukova, who survived in a basement as Mariupol was smashed to shards, wrote, “someone was bringing water to the corner of one of the streets every day from the city water canal. An ordinary city resident carried it in a huge barrel on his own initiative. He comes every day, and then stands under shelling and fills people’s bottles with free drinking water. I don’t know the name of this man and I hope he gets out of this hell alive.” It’s not just Ukrainians. Russians risked prison and police brutality to protest the war. In Belarus, people sabotaged the railroad lines being used to ship Russian war equipment to Ukraine. In Poland, people set up aid stations on the other side of the border, took refugees into their homes, set up community kitchens, gathered toys (even while Middle Eastern refugees suffered in the cold and died on other Polish borders). Citizens of other nations went to Ukraine to join the defending army in a mobilization often compared to that of the international brigades in the Spanish civil war. I have seen heroism many times before – in the pipeline resistance at Standing Rock, by the Zapatistas in Mexico, in the Arab Spring and the Syrian and Kurdish resistance. I’ve seen it not only in those taking physical risks but in those dedicated to the greater good and living their ideals. Still, even the word heroic seems odd or anachronistic now. The word is mostly retired now, or only pulled out for the gaming and blockbuster films and boys’ toys featuring action figures possessed of exceptional physical capacity, usually used to endure and inflict violence. And of course that is a physical rather than moral capacity that can be used just as readily to commit rape and genocide as to defend human rights. Too, there is more to heroism than physical courage. It is first of all a commitment to something beyond the self in times of peace as well as war. It can be the steadfast dedication to a goal or principle, the choice of the more difficult but idealistic path, the commitment to others. It can be a disruptive force, since it’s a characteristic of human beings who prize meaning, purpose, solidarity, and principle more than the things money can buy and corporations can sell. Selfishness and self-absorption make us good consumers and obedient citizens, or rather people not much bothering with citizenship as participation in public life and the collective good. Much entertainment and marketing can be conceived as a sort of feedback loop encouraging a shriveled, bereft version of human nature. In that version, the goal is always personal, as well-being, as product-enhanced conventional beauty or handsomeness bringing attention for some, as the acquisition of a lot of stuff, as security, ease, status, comfort and pleasure. Often there’s no clear line between the entertainment and the marketing, as celebrities become products or spokespeople for products. If there’s a banality of evil, there’s an evil in banality as this drastically reduced version of who we are and what we can aspire to and should desire. These versions don’t militate against the more expansive versions of who we can be and what we can love; they just ignore them. This week, a new climate project offered ideas and guidance to screenwriters to rectify the stunning absence of climate in most film and television now, noting “A climate story simply speaks to what it feels like to be alive right now. Yet, watching the vast majority of scripted TV shows and films today, you’d have no idea that Earth is in crisis – and us with it. And so the world depicted in the stories we watch and love is no longer an honest portrayal of the world we live in.” Surveys show that most people do care about climate, but the mainstream gives us versions of human nature in which ordinary people have little or no political power and the people around us are indifferent or oblivious, feeding inaction and despair. The heroic as I’d like it defined is at odds with this kind of rampant individualism just as citizens are the antithesis of consumers. If the consumer is focused on acquisition and the self, the citizen is focused on participation and the wider realms of the community or the nation or the world. Ukraine matters for its own sake, of course, and there is a very direct war between imperialism and authoritarianism and self-determination being fought. But Ukrainians, even as they receive aid from around the world, are giving us all something, a crash course in human capacity and in other versions of human nature than we are usually offered. We in the US face our own neofascists and would-be authoritarians, as we around the world face a climate crisis brought on by fossil-fuel interests’ selfishness and shortsightedness. Reminding us of who human beings can be, what it looks like to stand on principle, why it’s worth fighting whether or not you believe you can win, is a gift Ukrainians have given us. They remind us who we can be, and in facing the other crises of our time, who we need to be. Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.
