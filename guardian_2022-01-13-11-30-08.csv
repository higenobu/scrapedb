The Mirror’s banner headline on Thursday is “Disgrace”, set below a picture of Johnson giving his humiliating apology to the Commons for “not realising” the event in the back garden of 10 Downing Street on 20 May 2020 was a party.

A comment piece by columnist Juliet Samuel on the front page has the headline “PM buys time at cost of public mockery by admitting he’s an idiot”. In a possible sign of the seriousness of the situation, the Mail and Express have both decided it is time to circle the wagons around the PM – a sharp contrast with their treatment of the story earlier this week. “Operation Save Boris” says the Mail, reporting that “cabinet rallies round” but that “ambitious Rishi’s lukewarm support” spells trouble ahead.

Only the Sun rates it as the best today though with the splash head: “Damned old Duke of York”. Further afield, the Washington Post says there is one question that Britons are asking: What were you doing on 20 May 2020?”. It says “heartbreaking” interviews with people about their lockdown sacrifices reveal a “growing sense of betrayal” and increase pressure on Johnson. Also in the US, the furore has prompted the New York Times to round up all those other grovelling apologies. In Spain, El Pais says Johnson “does what no one would expect, and acts as if he is exempt from the rules that apply to the rest of the mortals”. The French newspaper Libération says that after “arrogant victories and pungent slogans”, the party is over for Johnson.",News/Media,‘Disgrace’: what the papers said as Boris Johnson faces calls to resign,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/13/disgrace-what-the-papers-said-as-boris-johnson-faces-calls-to-resign
1/13/2022,"As a nation, are Australians mature enough to acknowledge past wrongs? Do we even possess the base metal of curiosity to engage across cultures, when our disparate understandings of space, time and country struggle in translation? In 宿 (stay), a premiere work at Carriageworks for Sydney festival, two skeletons are found in a dried-up creek bed on a remote Queensland farm, drawing together three women who have never met. Written and directed by S Shakthidharan (Counting and Cracking), the production deploys live acting, music, dancing and singing blended with recorded music and performance on 10 high-definition vertically hung screens.  Dancer and actor Jasmin Sheppard, best known for playing the eponymous Patygerang as a member of the Bangarra Dance Theatre ensemble, brings her exquisite dancing repertoire to the role of Violet, whose Tagalaka ancestors have for some 75,000 years been custodians of the land where the skeletons were found. But Violet has now moved away. Violet receives a call from an anglo-Maltese woman, Thwayya (Aimée Falzon), who faces the loss of her farm, and for whom “forever” means five generations of living on this country. A family document offers clues to the death and destruction that binds the women’s pasts, presenting a puzzle as complex as modern Australian identities while attesting to the racist hierarchical control that colonisers placed on Aboriginal and Chinese labour. A third woman’s story is told via the large screens, as Tsuet-Cheng (Natalie Alexandra Tse) returns from Sydney to Singapore for “tomb sweeping day”, when families visit cemeteries to talk with ancestors. Between bursts of a Chinese plucked instrument called a guzheng, as well as flute, cello, drums, percussion and tabla, the on-screen banter between the musicians drops early hints about the familial links between the women. Inspired by the stories and cultural ceremonies of some ensemble members, this narrative concert is thematically ambitious and emotionally affecting, particularly in Sheppard’s final scene doubling as an ancestor, Daisy, alongside actor, vocalist and guitar player Charles Wu as a 19th-century Chinese gold prospector, An Hoo. Presented by Western Sydney company Kurinji and Singapore sound ensemble SAtheCollective, 宿 (stay) achieves so much in its 70 minutes, ranging across cultural genocide, remembrance, empathy and identity. However, the large theatre space at times overwhelms Sheppard and Falzon on stage, speaking to each other from opposite ends, and their early interactions are stilted. This could be improved by bringing the two actors to the centre of the stage much earlier. A little more clarity is needed when the women switch roles, too. The screens meanwhile are effective, particularly when depicting the high-rise Singapore tower blocks and the vast Tagalaka country, but too much is mediated by them. Perhaps the impracticalities of bringing Singaporean performers to Australia during the Covid-19 era necessitated an over-reliance on these large monitors, and limited the number of actors present on stage to three. Yet the production finds its feet as it progresses, Sheppard and Falzon acknowledging common ground across space and time, even when their mutual past is bound by sinister, gut-wrenching act that is viscerally played out in the work’s denouement. 宿 (stay) plays at Carriageworks until 16 January. Mask-wearing is mandatory for all Carriageworks indoor venues, although patrons may take them off to eat and drink in the foyer only. One foyer bar is open, and lines are socially distanced. Double-vaccination status is checked at the door and a QR check in is also required. The show runs for 70 minutes, with no interval, and is in Bay 17, an indoor theatre, with capacity of 570. In line with current state regulations, the venue is able to seat patrons at 100% capacity.",Arts/Culture,宿 (stay) review – S Shakthidharan’s thematically ambitious and affecting new work,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/13/stay-review-s-shakthidharans-thematically-ambitious-and-affecting-new-work
1/13/2022,"Crowds at the Australian Open will be capped at 50% after a surge in Covid cases prompted the Victorian government into a last-minute change of its ticketing policy. Ticket sales for the year’s opening grand slam tennis tournament in Melbourne will be restricted to 50% capacity for sessions which have not already sold more than that.  In a statement, the Victorian government said already-purchased tickets will remain valid, and there would be no changes to ground pass access. “Face masks will be mandatory for all patrons, except when eating or drinking, and the event will align with Victoria’s statewide Covid-safe settings,” the statement read. “This includes a density limit of one person per two square metres for all indoor hospitality. “Ventilation will be improved in indoor areas of Melbourne Park, with HEPA filters to be installed in some spaces after a ventilation assessment is completed for the venue. “As Covid-19 hospitalisations and cases continue to rise in Victoria, these mitigation strategies are proportionate and designed to assist in limiting the spread of Covid-19.” The build-up to this year’s Open has been overshadowed by the saga surrounding defending champion Novak Djokovic. The world No 1, who spent four days in an immigration detention hotel after his Australian visa was cancelled by border officials, remains in limbo, despite winning a court challenge against the decision earlier this week. Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, is yet to decide whether to use his personal powers to deport the unvaccinated star. Victoria recorded 37,169 cases of Covid on Thursday, three days out from the start of the tournament, with 25 deaths recorded and 953 people in hospital. “These updates to arrangements for the Australian Open will mean that fans, players and the workforce can look forward to a terrific Covid-safe event in Australia’s event capital,” said Jaala Pulford, the acting minister for tourism, sport and major events. “Melbourne Park is the best place on the planet to watch the tennis and thousands of spectators will be able to experience the iconic Australian Open from Monday.” Last year’s tournament was also played in front of reduced crowds due to the pandemic.

1/13/2022,"The federal health department bought $62m worth of rapid antigen tests on Monday using the “extreme urgency or events unforeseen” provisions of its procurement rules as it seeks to secure stock to meet its commitment to provide free rapid antigen tests to lower-income Australians. But the massive buying spree by the federal government could further exacerbate the shortage of tests on the open market.  Some suppliers are notifying customers that they are unable to secure supply from their importers and distributors. Rapid Proof, a Melbourne-based online retailer, told customers on Tuesday it could no longer supply Hough brand tests because the company “could not meet supply”. Hough is one of the five companies contracted by the federal government on Monday to provide tests. Hough will provide $4.4m worth of rapid antigen tests to the Department of Health between 10 to 17 January, according to the note. The full contract notes published on Wednesday show the federal government has used a provision in its procurement rules which allow it to avoid going to open tender. Each note says the government relied on the “extreme urgency or events unforeseen” condition to avoid an open tender process. The tests were approved for general use in September, and the government has been telling the public for months the new strategy is to live with the virus now that there are high vaccination rates. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said while the prime minister didn’t need to be “Nostradamus”, he should have listened to health experts and planned for the current Covid-19 outbreak.“The national plan made it clear that once we opened up there would be an increased number of infections and we needed to make sure we planned for it,” he told the ABC. He added: “Some $62m of RATs that have been purchased were because of urgent and ‘unforeseen circumstances’ as part of the tender. Well, this was foreseen ... we needed Scott Morrison to do his job but he just went through saying, ‘We will all be together at Christmas, it will all be right,’ without putting in place [the] mechanisms required.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Leaders will decide at national cabinet on Thursday a date for when concession card holders will able to access the tests from pharmacies, as well as rubber-stamp arrangements for the scheme. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has again called for rapid antigen tests to be free and easily accessible ahead of the meeting. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, said the first priority was keeping workers safe, as leaders discuss adding more industries and workers to the list of close contacts exempt from quarantine requirements. “The current conflict over this issue is a result of the Morrison government’s refusal to make RATs free,” she said. “Employers do not want to pay, leaving the cost to be borne by individual workers. “Rapid antigen tests are an essential part of keeping workers and the whole community safe, and this is the only way that businesses will be able to stay open and function.” The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, appeared to rule out any widespread scheme to make tests free, as they are in the UK. “This idea that everybody gets them for free, I don’t know about that,” he told the Nine Network. “The money doesn’t fall out of the air, we take it off your wages, salaries, businesses, to pay for them. It goes on the credit card and you pay for it later on.” Guardian Australia has approached Rapid Proof and the Department of Health for comment. with Australian Associated Press",News/Australia news,‘Extreme urgency or events unforeseen’: Australian government buys up $62m worth of rapid antigen tests,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/13/extreme-urgency-or-events-unforeseen-australian-government-buys-up-62m-worth-of-rapid-antigen-tests
