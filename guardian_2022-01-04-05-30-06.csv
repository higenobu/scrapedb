1/4/2022,"Apple became the first US company to be valued at over $3tn on Monday as the tech company continued its phenomenal share price growth, tripling in value in under four years. A pandemic-era surge in tech stocks has driven the major US tech companies to new highs, pulling US stock markets with them. Apple became the world’s first trillion dollar company in August 2018, passed $2tn in 2020 and hit its new high as trading began after the holidays and its shares passed $182.80 a piece before dipping lower.  Apple alone is now more valuable than the combined values of Boeing, Coca-Cola, Disney, Exxon-Mobil, McDonald’s, Netflix and Walmart. Its shares have risen 38% since the beginning of 2021, one of the largest gains on the Dow Jones industrial average stock market index. The company released its last quarterly earnings in October and made a profit of $20.6bn over the previous three months despite suffering from Covid-related supply chain issues. It is unlikely to remain the only $3tn company as analysts expect Microsoft will also hit the mark later this year. The news came as US markets edged higher and European shares bounded to record highs in the first day of trading in 2022 as investors bet on a steady economic recovery despite the rising number of Covid-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant. Europe’s benchmark stock index, the Stoxx 600, rose to a record intraday high of 491.73 points on Monday, surpassing its November peak of 490.58, as global oil and equity markets climbed. It later closed at 489.99, up 0.45%. The Stoxx 600 recorded a 22.4% jump last year, its second-best yearly performance in over a decade, after the global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and government stimulus spending encouraged investors to pour money back into the markets. The share price of airlines Lufthansa and Air France–KLM were two of the biggest climbers across Europe’s equity markets after analysts at Citi forecast that the reopening of travel routes to Asia could help bolster the beleaguered travel sector. Lufthansa shares rose by almost 8.9% to €6.73 a share, and Air France KLM rose by 4.9% to €4.06. Europe’s record start to the new year set the stage for US markets to continue their late 2021 recovery. The opening of the S&P 500 index, which climbed by a record 47.7% last year, was bolstered by a 9% jump in Tesla shares after the company’s quarterly deliveries exceeded expectations. In another boost to US markets global oil prices, which last year recorded their biggest annual rise since at least 2016, resumed their rise towards $80 a barrel as fears that emerged late last year over the impact of the Omicron variant waned. The oil price helped shares in US oil majors Chevron and ExxonMobil climb by 1% each. The London Stock Exchange (LSE), which has lagged behind its European and US rivals by climbing 14.3% last year, was closed on Monday for the new year bank holiday. The FTSE 100 has been criticised as “old-fashioned” due to its dearth of tech companies and a glut of oil and bank stocks. It remained 6.5% below its May 2018 peak last year while the US, German and French markets all hit record highs. Sean Darby, a global equity strategist at Jefferies, said: “Although Covid-19 variants permeated the global economy, 2021 was the year of records with many bourses closing at or near record highs, while inflows into equities surpassed their largest accumulation ever. Peering into 2022, we expect volatility to rise.” Global oil markets are also expected to face ongoing volatility in the year ahead as traders balance the risk that the Omicron variant may stall a rebound in demand for transport fuels, against uncertain supplies from the world’s biggest oil producers.",News/Technology,Apple becomes first US company to reach $3tn valuation,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/03/apple-becomes-first-us-company-to-reach-3tn-valuation
1/4/2022,"On the morning of Monday 27 September, a crew member on board the Hsinlong 1 fishing vessel went to fetch his friend Arnold Latu for breakfast. Latu, in his mid-30s, was the monitoring officer of the Chinese-owned, Fiji-flagged vessel, employed by the Tongan government to check that the amount of fish caught on its three-week voyage was legal and correctly recorded.  The Hsinlong 1 had almost completed its work and was berthed close to Pangaimotu Island, off the shores of Nuku’alofa, awaiting the OK from local authorities to berth at the Tuimatamoana fishing wharf. “We were just about to have breakfast and get ready for the vessel to go in to the wharf to berth and one of the crew members had gone to call Latu to come and have breakfast,” said a senior crew member onboard the vessel at the time, who did not wish to be named. “The crew member shouted to us that Latu was not responding to his calls and was lying on his bed. We went in and touched his body which was already cold. We were shocked and did not know what to do.” Latu’s friends remember him as a hard worker, a friendly person who got along with everyone, and a “good listener and one who is always keen to help anyone”. He was also described as a “marine man” who loved the seas and his job at Fisheries. His longtime friend Benny Jagroop, who was not on the vessel, described him as a “little brother” who came from a tough neighbourhood, but worked with a local group called Falepiliki (brick house) to try to support young men to stay in school, and stay out of trouble. “Latu’s death is still a mystery for us,” said Jagroop. “So if you ask what [is] the speculation around Arnold’s death, for real I have no idea.” After they found him dead, crew members alerted the ship’s captain, and Tongan police were contacted. But nearly three months later and despite calls for a transparent investigation from international bodies, there are no answers about what caused the apparently healthy man’s death, and neither police, nor the government of Tonga were willing to speak about the case. Dr Tuikolongahau Halafihi, chief executive of Tonga’s Ministry of Fisheries, said they were not able to release any information because the case was still being investigated by Tonga police. “I won’t be able to give you any information about this case as we are still awaiting the report from police and health. We are still after this report but it’s still with the police,” he said in an email response to questions from the Guardian. Tonga police did not reply to requests for comment. Despite calls from non-government organisations like WWF and the Association of Professional Observers (APO), the cause of death and results of the postmortem examination have not been revealed by authorities. The WWF wrote about Latu in its December position paper, saying that there had been no report of the cause of death, nor was there any information to “suggest he was sick or injured” before his death. Bubba Cook, WWF western and central Pacific tuna programme manager, called for transparency and a thorough investigation of any reported deaths or incidents involving fisheries observers. “In the case of any missing human, from a vessel, [if] there’s a death of anyone, whether it’s crew member or a fisheries observer, there should be an investigation into that fatality. And it should be a thorough investigation and the information about that should be made public,” he said. Hsinlong Fisheries Ltd, the owner of Hsinlong 1, did not respond to detailed questions from the Guardian. Nor did Tonga police. There is no evidence of foul play in Latu’s death, however the uncertainty as to how he died has attracted the attention of the WWF and the APO, which monitor the safety of fishing observers around the world. Being an observer, which involves monitoring fishing practices and catches to make sure boats follow the rules, is a dangerous job that can put observers in conflict with the crews on the vessels on which they are working – often hundreds, or even thousands, of kilometres from the nearest port. According to the Association for Professional Observers, there have been more than a dozen cases of observers dying on the job since 2009 alone, including a number from the Pacific. Eritara Aati Kaierua from Kiribati died onboard a fishing vessel in 2020. His family have serious concerns about the investigation conducted into his death. Antin Tamwabeti, also from Kiribati, died on another boat in May 2019, in circumstances which have not been reported, though his case was ruled a suicide. According to the company that hired him, he was harassed and threatened by the crew of the Taiwanese-flagged boat he was on shortly before his death. The WWF has argued that Latu’s death has “exposed a significant potential weakness in regional observer safety and security measures related to jurisdictional ambiguity”. Because Latu’s deployment was classified as a national trip and the vessel was fishing in Tonga’s waters, Latu was not given safety equipment that he would have been given if the trip had been in international waters and had fallen within the context of a Regional Observer Programme trip. But the WWF says this should not matter. “We’ve made good advancements to addressing the safety issues with observers … but they didn’t go far enough,” said Cook. “And I think that’s evidenced by Arnold Latu’s situation, because he was on a national trip, there was some jurisdictional ambiguity around who was responsible, on what rules are subject to with respect to safety. And our position is, if you’re not protecting all of the observers, you’re not protecting any of them.” In a document shared with the Guardian by the Association for Professional Observers (APO), Samuela Bulimetuira, the manager of safety compliance and response at the Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji, wrote that since Latu’s death occurred in Tongan waters, Tonga was responsible for investigating. Tonga and the company that owned the vessel “have an obligation to report all incidents especially deaths onboard to the Flag State Authority [Fiji] as soon as is practicable”. Bulimetuira did not respond to questions from the Guardian.",News/World news,‘It’s a mystery for us’: the puzzling death at sea of a Tongan fisheries observer,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/its-a-mystery-for-us-the-puzzling-death-at-sea-of-a-tongan-fisheries-observer
1/4/2022,"Five of the world’s most powerful nations have agreed that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought” in a rare joint pledge to reduce the risk of such a conflict ever starting. The pledge was signed by the US, Russia, China, the UK and France, the five nuclear weapons states recognised by the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) who are also the five permanent members of the UN security council. They are known as the P5 or the N5.  Such a common statement on a major issue of global security has become a rarity at a time of increasing friction between Russia, China and the west. With Moscow threatening to invade Ukraine and China signaling its readiness to use military force against Taiwan, the joint statement represents a renewed commitment to prevent any confrontation turning into a nuclear catastrophe. A senior US state department official said the wording of the statement had been hammered out at P5 meetings over several months, despite the high-tension environment. “At the base level to be able to say that this is how we think about these risks, and this is an acknowledgement that it is something that we want to avoid, particularly during a difficult time, I think is noteworthy,” the official said. The release of the statement had been timed to coincide with the five-yearly review conference of the NPT, but that conference has been postponed amid the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, and disagreements on whether the session could be held virtually. “We affirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,” the statement said, echoing a joint declaration by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev at a 1985 summit in Geneva. The NPT was a bargain between states without nuclear weapons, who pledged not to acquire them, and the five nuclear-armed states, which promised to disarm. The review conference, originally planned for 2020, was expected to be contentious as a result of the stalling of momentum towards disarmament and the moves made by the five weapons states to modernise their arsenals. Four other countries with nuclear weapons, not recognised under NPT: Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea – have also shown no signs of reducing their stockpiles. Meanwhile, the breakdown of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran and the deadlock so far in attempts to salvage it, have raised the risks of nuclear proliferation, particularly in the Middle East. Monday’s joint statement was aimed at improving the atmosphere at the NPT review conference. Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin had reaffirmed the Gorbachev-Reagan declaration at a summit in June, and the move was welcomed by China. China’s vice foreign minister Ma Zhaoxu welcomed Monday’s statement as “positive and weighty”, adding it would “help increase mutual trust and replace competition among major powers with coordination and cooperation”. It took several months of negotiation over the wording of the declaration before all five powers were ready to agree. France in particular had concerns that such a statement would undermine the deterrent effect of its arsenal. “France has a nuclear doctrine reserving the right of a pre-strategic use of a nuclear weapon to warn off the aggressor or even to a state sponsor of terrorism”, said Oliver Meier, senior researcher at the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy. “This is a way, you could argue, of winning a nuclear war – with a limited use of nuclear weapons to end a conflict.” Meier said the UK’s reservations were not so clearly expressed but he believed them to be similar. A line in the joint statement saying that “nuclear weapons – for as long as they continue to exist – should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression, and prevent war,” were added to address French concerns. The five nuclear weapons powers also stated that the “reduction of strategic risks”, making sure global tensions never lead to nuclear conflict, was one of their “foremost responsibilities”. “We underline our desire to work with all states to create a security environment more conducive to progress on disarmament,” the statement said. A senior US official said: “This is a substance-heavy document that goes beyond just the reaffirmation of the idea that a nuclear war cannot be not be won and should never be fought. There is additional content that is reflective of a good and substantive and constructive conversation about how to reduce nuclear threats and eventually eliminate them.” “Given the security environment, I’m pretty shocked that the P5 could agree to this much,’ Heather Williams, a senior lecturer in defence studies at King’s College London, said. Williams and other nuclear experts have urged the nuclear weapons powers to improve their channels of crisis communications as one of the ways of reducing risks of an unplanned clash escalating into nuclear conflict. She said she hoped discussions on such risk reduction would continue despite the postponement of the NPT review conference. Arms control advocates widely welcomed the declaration but called for it to be backed up by a return to disarmament. “With nine nuclear arsenals currently being enhanced, and Covid problems besetting nuclear-armed submarines and facilities, this statement from five of the nuclear-armed leaders is welcomed, but does not go far enough,” said Rebecca Johnson, the vice president of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the first president of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. “Of course leaders need to avoid military confrontations, increase mutual understanding and recognise that nuclear war cannot be won and must not be fought, but these words are nothing without concrete disarmament and diplomatic actions to eliminate nuclear arsenals and dangers. As long as nuclear weapons continue to be advertised and wielded by some, we are all put at risk of nuclear war.”",News/World news,Five of world’s most powerful nations pledge to avoid nuclear war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/five-nations-pledge-avoid-nuclear-war
1/4/2022,"Twins in Salinas, California were born 15 minutes apart but won’t share a birthday – or even the same birth year. Aylin Yolanda Trujillo was delivered at Natividad medical center at exactly midnight on 1 January. She was the first baby born in Monterey county in 2022, as the US west coast ushered in a new year.  But her brother, Alfredo Antonio Trujillo, had arrived just before her, at 11.45pm on 31 December, as 2021 came to a close. “It’s crazy to me that they are twins and have different birthdays,” said Aylin and Alfredo’s mother, Fatima Madrigal. “I was surprised and happy that she arrived at midnight.” Aylin was born a healthy 5lb 14oz, while Antonio weighed in at 6lb 1oz. The twins, from Greenfield, California, have two older sisters and an older brother, who was said to be excited for another boy to join the family. Photos showed both babies with their eyes closed, swaddled in matching striped blankets and wearing pink-striped beanies. The chance of twins being born on different days, months and years is relatively low. While there were about 3.75m births in the US in 2019, only about 120,000 – or about 3% – were twins, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Twin deliveries that straddle the narrow window of time between the last seconds of December and first moments of January are even less common. “This was definitely one of the most memorable deliveries of my career,” said Ana Abril Arias, a family doctor at Natividad medical group. “It was an absolute pleasure to help these little ones arrive here safely in 2021 and 2022. What an amazing way to start the New Year!”",News/US news,US twins delivered just minutes apart end up being born in two different years,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/03/twins-born-minutes-apart-born-two-different-years
1/4/2022,"Manchester United appear to be a work not in progress but regression. Ralf Rangnick is overseeing a team who set out with a structure against Crystal Palace – his first game in charge – but have, since, slid slowly backwards. João Moutinho’s sweet 81st-minute volley handed Wolverhampton Wanderers a first league win here since 1980 while starting an inquest into where United are headed under an interim manager whose two main tenets seem to have gone AWOL. First, the “godfather of pressing” seems, oddly, to have eschewed his beloved mode of intensive shutting-down. Secondly, the 4-2-2-2 he adheres to, has become aimless and misshapen.  Before Moutinho crashed home – from a Phil Jones headed clearance – Romain Saïss hit a free-kick off the excellent David de Gea’s bar: United having existed in a quasi-survival mode for the entire game, which is hardly the way to prosper. Jones’s first appearance since January 2020 – an FA Cup tie, 707 days ago – vied with Bruno Fernandes’s failure to be reinstated following a one-game suspension, as the headline team news. Jones, who suffered a string of injuries including a serious knee problem, was chosen due to the unavailability of Victor Lindelöf, Harry Maguire and Eric Bailly – the first two with knocks, the latter due to covid – as the 29-year-old partnered Raphaël Varane in central defence. Fernandes’s non-selection was different: an uneven season featuring five goals, plus United’s win over Burnley here last time out, meant Rangnick felt neither Mason Greenwood or Jadon Sancho should make way for a footballer who has, in essence, been the de facto captain. From the opening kick United were forced to ball-watch. And when they did wrest hold of it Cristiano Ronaldo, tonight’s captain, and Luke Shaw, were both careless. But, then, Greenwood showed the way: a Nemanja Matic chest-and-pass to the youngster was as neat as the latter’s skip infield and arrow into Sancho. This had him bursting in on goal, and though his shot disappointed – and ignored the overlapping Ronaldo – United hoped this might settle them. But no: the rest of the contest was dire from them, as De Gea again emerged as their finest performer. Jones – until his error that allowed the winner – also impressed, following one commanding header with an intercept of a Nélson Semedo crossfield ball. The former England man, though, was unable to stop Daniel Podence’s run-then-shot which forced De Gea into a sharp save. From the subsequent corner United’s goalkeeper then had to leap towards his top right-hand corner to repel Rúben Neves when he blazed from 20 yards out. Wolves were a blur of gold. Podence nipped in and Aaron Wan-Bissaka toed the ball out for another corner. When United threatened a breakaway from this, Jones passed straight into touch. “Control” has been Rangnick’s mantra yet United enjoyed zero. After Semedo became the latest Wolves man to burn De Gea’s fingers from close range, a sequence involving Ronaldo, Scott McTominay, and Wan-Bissaka ended in Sancho’s effort being blocked. Podence next slipped by Jones, swivelled, and tested De Gea’s reflexes with nothing close to the Rannick high press in evidence. When Semedo did exactly this on Sancho suddenly Raúl Jiménez was keeping De Gea honest – once more – from distance. Remarkable, too, was how Edinson Cavani, McTominay, Wan-Bissaka and Ronaldo could commit schoolboy howlers. The right-back did so in a phase that allowed Wolves to break before Ronaldo’s intended backpass of a header went close to setting-up Jiménez for the opener. A Cavani 30-yard attempt that sailed over José Sá’s goal summed up United ahead of the interval: toothless. Francisco Trincão being stymied at the death by Jones at close range was Wolves in microcosm: impressive. So the visitors continued in the second half. Podence and Jiménez were thorns up-front and a Saïss 50-yard surge from centre-back posed United another problem. Only Greenwood’s rapier thrusts appeared to offer the insipid home side a chance of what would be a shock strike yet when Fernandes came on it was the England youngster who was hooked. This caused boos and Rangnick’s thought-process baffled – Sancho had been far less effective. Still, Fernandes soon crashed the ball back off Sá’s bar, and Ronaldo headed in – he was offside – then hit a chance wide when racing clear. These misses were costly – Fernandes had an added-time free-kick beaten away by Sa, too. By the final whistle, huge credit had to go to Bruno Lage and his team. But Rangnick now has to show what he possesses as this was the poorest outing yet under him. He may wish to point to the five unbeaten matches before this reverse, but all of these were versus moderate opposition.",Sport/Football,Moutinho’s strike earns Wolves deserved victory against insipid United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/manchester-united-wolves-premier-league-match-report
