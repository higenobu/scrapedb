3/18/2022,"A Papua New Guinean MP has been charged with murder, after the shooting death of a man at a restaurant in the capital of Port Moresby last week. Police will allege that Lohia Boe Samuel, the MP for Moresby North-West, was having dinner with Robert Jerry and another man at Fushion 2 restaurant on Friday 11 March when a firearm was discharged, killing Jerry. The deceased, 38-year-old Robert Jerry from Morobe is survived by his wife and seven young children - the youngest a seven-month-old baby. Anthony Wagambie, the assistant police commissioner, said that the incident occurred between 7pm and 8pm last Friday. Wagambie said while “we understand the emotions and public outcry through different forms of media, the constabulary has a constitutional duty to perform and must remain focused throughout the investigation. “Investigators had to piece together information and evidence before effecting the arrest today.” Samuel is a first-term government MP, having been elected to parliament last year in a by-election. Opposition Leader Beldan Namah has called for Samuel’s immediate resignation while the criminal matter proceeds Wagambie has said police will allege that the firearm is owned by and licensed to Samuel. “The MP was invited to Boroko Police station and escorted to the NCD Homicide section and charged under section 300 sub section (1) (b)(ii) of the PNG Criminal Code Act.” That section applies to acts done for an unlawful purpose and likely to “endanger human life”, regardless of intent. Wagambie said another man who was also present at the time of the incident was also charged as an accomplice in the murder case. That man has not been named. Wagambie said both Samuel and the other man are currently detained at the Boroko police station and have been refused bail.",News/World news,Papua New Guinean MP charged with murder over shooting death in restaurant,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/papua-new-guinean-mp-charged-with-over-shooting-death-in-restaurant
3/18/2022,"Chelsea have fielded strong teams throughout their run – few clubs take upholding the sporting integrity of this competition so seriously – with Lewis Hall, who excelled on his first-team debut against Chesterfield in the third round, the one genuinely unfamiliar name to be fielded so far. But the only player who has been present for every minute of their three Cup ties is Malang Sarr – indeed the 23-year-old has played every minute of every one of Chelsea’s domestic cup ties this season except the most important, the Carabao Cup final, which he watched from the bench. In that time he has played at centre-back in a four, as centre-back in a three, and at left-back, but his defending was criticised for both Luton goals in the fifth round and, having been unconvincing when given a rare Premier League outing against Newcastle last weekend, his position as Chelsea’s not-that-important-domestic-cup-tie specialist might be under threat. SB Middlesbrough v Chelsea, FA Cup quarter-final, Saturday 5.15pm (all times GMT) When Chris Wilder was sacked by Sheffield United a year ago towards the end of the Blades’ miserable second season in the Premier League, there was shock in some quarters and an acceptance results had got too bad in others. Like Marcelo Bielsa at Leeds last month, Wilder left Yorkshire a hero for what he had done before, and with few people questioning his coaching talent. It has been uplifting and reassuring then to see the transformation he has overseen at Middlesbrough, guiding them into play-off contention in the Championship and to an FA Cup quarter-final against Chelsea. Manchester United (on penalties) and Tottenham (after extra time) have been dumped out along the way, with Boro seemingly getting stronger as those games wore on. With Chelsea in turmoil off the pitch, and Wilder’s players – and the Riverside faithful – no doubt intent on punishing the Blues for their embarrassing attempt to keep the home fans out, the visitors could be in for a tricky evening. RB Surprisingly, in their home games against Shrewsbury, Cardiff and Norwich in this season’s Cup, Liverpool have had only two more shots on target than Nottingham Forest have in their considerably harder assignments against Arsenal, Leicester and Huddersfield, and conceded only one shot on target fewer. A curiosity of Forest’s Cup run is that while in the league they score with approximately one shot in every eight (53 goals from 428 shots), in this year’s Cup they have scored with one shot in every 3.7, a statistically unlikely success rate unmatched by any other side left in the competition. Liverpool have converted 55 shots into nine goals, very similar to their Premier League conversion ratio, and Forest 26 shots into seven goals. SB Nottingham Forest v Liverpool, FA Cup quarter-final, Sunday 6pm Southampton will draw considerable strength from previous results this season against the Premier League leaders. They shared the points home and away with Pep Guardiola’s side, a head-to-head record bettered only by Crystal Palace, who won at the Etihad and held them to a goalless draw at Selhurst Park on Monday. No reason to feel intimidated then, especially with Manchester City’s usually smooth engine stuttering ever so slightly. On the downside for Southampton, arguably the best prolonged spell of form since Ralph Hassenhüttl arrived has been abruptly ended by three straight defeats in the league. Booking a place in the FA Cup semi-finals would be just the tonic. LM Southampton v Manchester City, FA Cup quarter-final, Sunday 3pm Everton’s constant switching between defensive formations, playing a back four here, a back three there, or, as against Wolves last weekend, a back three and a back four at different stages of the game, is surely one of the causes (not a short list) of their recent failings. In the past fortnight Jonjoe Kenny, a right-back, has played left-back in a four and centre-back in a three. Crystal Palace meanwhile have the benefit of absolute consistency in defence: when fit Tyrick Mitchell, Marc Guéhi, Joachim Andersen and Joel Ward play as a four. But now, perhaps for the first time this season, there is some uncertainty – Ward missed four matches with a groin injury before being judged ready only for a place on the bench against Manchester City on Monday, and in his absence Nathaniel Clyne has impressed, leaving Patrick Vieira with a decision to make. When Everton travelled to Palace in December they had not lost there in 10 visits over nearly 20 years, in which time they had won five times at Selhurst Park. They lost 3-1. SB Crystal Palace v Everton, FA Cup quarter-final, Sunday 12.30pm With Everton low on confidence and focused on a relegation scrap, Crystal Palace will fancy their chances of a return to Wembley for the first time since they lost the FA Cup final to Manchester United there in 2016. Who can forget that Alan Pardew dad-dance? The Toffees have lost every away match under Frank Lampard while Palace will be buoyed up by their heroic display in earning a point against Manchester City last Monday. The on-loan Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher was excellent again in that match and will probably be a thorn in the side of Lampard, who is a known admirer. Palace have lost only two matches in 10 – to Liverpool and Chelsea – and could start to sense that silverware is not beyond them. GB A pre-Christmas Covid-19 postponement means that Tottenham will come up against Brighton twice in a month, having defeated them 2-0 away from home on Wednesday. Their upcoming fixtures all look tricky but winnable, starting against West Ham on Sunday before Newcastle (home), Aston Villa (away) and Brighton’s visit to north London. “I think we’re going step by step and I’m beginning to see my team improving in every game,” Antonio Conte said after Wednesday’s victory, and it does look like real progress is being made. Sunday’s opponents also have designs on fourth place, but have appeared to be running out of steam a little, so it feels like a match Spurs should win. The result could have a significant impact on both clubs’ attempt to qualify for the Champions League and even, perhaps, on whether Conte decides to stay for the long haul. A spirit-sapping defeat to a top-four rival would certainly be a step in the wrong direction. LM Tottenham v West Ham, Premier League, Sunday 4.30pm There were moments in the 2-1 defeat at West Ham when Aston Villa looked more inclined to play safe possession football. It was an understandable approach given that, under Steven Gerrard, Villa have yet to beat a side in top-four contention. But having gone into that game on a three-match winning run in which they scored 10 and conceded none, perhaps they could have been a bit more expressive. With Arsenal visiting Villa Park on the back of very little rest since their match against Liverpool, perhaps this is the best opportunity Gerrard will get to earn a notable victory in his nascent career as a Premier League manager. The Gunners will not be as rigid as West Ham and Philippe Coutinho will surely look to find space between the lines, so perhaps Gerrard should encourage a braver mindset this time round. GB Aston Villa v Arsenal, Premier League, Saturday 12.30pm Kalvin Phillips and Liam Cooper, neither of whom have played a first-team game since the draw with Brentford in the first weekend of December, are finally ready to return as Leeds seek to follow the dramatic victory over Norwich with three more points that, given the form of the teams below them, would make them far more secure than any side with 29 points at this stage of the season has any right to be. As Leeds seek to carefully manage their comebacks – they start April with games against out-of-form Southampton and Watford and, with a couple of good performances, could be virtually safe by Easter – a place on the bench is their likely fate. Meanwhile Junior Firpo’s knee injury means he is unlikely to come up against Rúben Neves in a battle of the league’s most-booked players – they have nine cautions each though Firpo is very much the man in form, with four in five league appearances since January. SB Wolves v Leeds, Premier League, Friday 8pm “I’m a Premier League striker now, I can’t wait to score goals in the Prem.” The words of Ivan Toney after Brentford confirmed promotion last season. He hadn’t scored many of them until recent weeks. Now, with five goals in his past two Premier League matches for Brentford – and eight in his past six in all competitions – he finally looks like the prolific top-flight striker he hoped he would be. The influence of Christian Eriksen has obviously helped, with Thomas Frank’s side a more smooth attacking unit with the Danish playmaker pulling the strings, but Toney is a craftier striker than many give him credit for. At times this season, he has had to feed off knockdowns and play the role of the hold-up man. Now he can focus more on getting into space to finish the chances he knows Eriksen will make for him. “Left foot, right foot, he’ll put it on a plate for you and it’s up to you to put it in the back of the net,” said Toney. So, can Leicester stop him scoring again?

3/18/2022,"Ministers failed to allow parliament enough opportunity to scrutinise the sweeping laws passed to tackle the Covid pandemic, according to a cross-party committee of MPs. The 329-page Coronavirus Act of 2020 included a wide range of emergency powers, from allowing more court hearings to take place by video, to allowing retired healthcare workers to come back into the workforce. The legislation also postponed mayoral and local elections due in 2020, and extended the government’s powers to shut down schools and order the cancellation of public gatherings – though in the event, many of the most stringent restrictions on the public’s lives were imposed using pre-existing public health law. There was little opposition when the act was passed, with many MPs won over by the promise of a six-monthly review. The public administration and constitutional affairs committee (Pacac) points out that in the event, this was little more than a formality, because it took place through an unamendable, “take it or leave it” motion. “It is unsatisfactory that since the Coronavirus Act was passed, in just three sitting days in March 2020, parliament has been unable to substantively debate its provisions as was promised during its passage,” said the committee chair, William Wragg. “Strong and broad powers such as those in the act must be accompanied by equally robust parliamentary scrutiny mechanisms, particularly in a rapidly evolving public health emergency.” Pacac also raises the question of whether attaching a two-year “sunset clause” to the bill was the right approach, arguing that it led to MPs backing “stronger and broader powers,” than they might otherwise have been willing to accept. “Any future use of sunset clauses in relation to emergency legislation should come with a clear explanation about why the government believes that the length of sunset being imposed is proportionate to the emergency being addressed,” it says. As the pandemic progressed, Conservative backbenchers became increasingly concerned about some of the powers in the act – as well as the use of public health regulations to create new offences, punishable with fines. The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) revealed on Wednesday that 40% of the fixed penalty notices issued in England and Wales between March 2020 and 27 February this year – more than 50,000 – were not paid within 28 days. The Metropolitan police will decide in the coming weeks whether the prime minister should face a fine himself, for attending one or more lockdown-busting gatherings in Downing Street. As well as calling for more scrutiny of future emergency legislation, Pacac’s report also calls on the government to set a clearer timetable for the public inquiry into the pandemic, which is currently consulting on draft terms of reference. Wragg said: “I welcome the government’s announcement on the UK Covid-19 inquiry but urge it to allow for evidence sooner rather than later, before memories fade and key learning is lost.” Boris Johnson initially resisted calls for a public inquiry before announcing one, but insisting it would not start work until this spring. It is being chaired by retired judge Heather Hallett.",News/World news,Ministers failed to allow parliament opportunity to scrutinise UK Covid laws,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/ministers-failed-to-allow-parliament-opportunity-to-scrutinise-uk-covid-laws
3/18/2022,"Thousands of steelworkers were the victims of pension regulation failures that left some with losses of up to £489,000, an official report has found, prompting accusations that the UK financial watchdog was “asleep at the wheel”. The National Audit Office’s findings relate to a 2017 scandal involving members of the British Steel pension scheme, many of whom were persuaded to transfer their retirement savings by advisers who then pocketed huge fees. The NAO, the government’s public spending watchdog, said some of those who transferred the cash to a different provider “have suffered significant financial losses because they were provided with unsuitable advice … and they have not been compensated fully”. It said “the regulated financial advice market failed to protect them”. The Financial Conduct Authority was, and still is, the relevant watchdog. That prompted Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee, to say the case “was a failure from top to bottom … The FCA, whose job it is to regulate these firms, was asleep at the wheel”. The FCA has come under fire in the recent past over its mishandling of an another investment scandal involving London Capital & Finance, a firm that collapsed in 2019, leaving many individuals nursing big losses. The British Steel pension plan was a large “defined benefit” scheme with about 130,000 members which was restructured in 2017 after British Steel’s then-owner Tata Steel experienced financial difficulties. At the time, members typically had to decide between two options for managing their pension benefits, though about 44,000 members – typically non-pensioners more than a year away from retirement age – also had a third option: they could “transfer out”, which meant taking their pension elsewhere. Approximately 7,834 members – representing £2.8bn of the fund – chose to move their cash. But, the NAO said, many of these people were “particularly vulnerable to pension advice mis-selling”. Many had limited experience of making decisions about complex financial products, and there were huge sums at stake: the average transfer value was £365,000, but some individuals had pension pots worth more than £1m. In December 2017 the Guardian reported that the scheme shake-up had triggered a “feeding frenzy” among certain financial advisers. At a parliamentary hearing that month, MPs forced the FCA to name and shame three firms they said were “ripping people off”. The NAO report said that, according to the regulator, the financial advice provided to individuals was unsuitable in 47% of cases. Some may have been persuaded to put their cash into inappropriate investments. Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “It is clear that many people have not been compensated fully under current arrangements.” For example, 263 scheme members have lost out on a total of £18m of redress to date because the financial advisers they used have gone into liquidation, and there are limits to the official compensation that can be awarded. The average loss for British Steel pension scheme claims resolved by the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme – the official rescue fund for customers of failed firms – is £82,600, with individual losses ranging from zero to £489,000. But the compensation relating to advice firms that went out of business after April 2019 is capped at £85,000. In the coming days the FCA will give more information about whether, and how, it will implement a consumer redress scheme for those affected, where all firms involved would have to review their advice and potentially offer compensation. In a statement the FCA said it welcomed the report, “which highlights the complex issues for government and regulators which arose from the exceptional circumstances around [this case] and the framework for pension freedoms”. It added: “We recognise the harm these circumstances caused to steelworkers and communities.”",News/Business,"Thousands of UK steelworkers victims of pension regulation scandal, says NAO",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/18/thousands-of-uk-steelworkers-victims-of-pension-regulation-scandal-says-nao
3/18/2022,"About one-third of young children and teenagers with disabilities faced emotional and physical abuse, while 20% experience neglect and one in 10 sexual violence, according to international research. Analysis involving more than 16 million young people from 25 countries conducted between 1990 and 2020, published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health journal, shows that 31.7% of children with disabilities have experienced violence. They are twice as likely to face neglect and/or sexual, physical or mental abuse than children with no disabilities. They are also far more likely to be bullied by their peers. Researchers from Leeds, Oxford, Beijing and Columbia universities examined data measuring violence against children with disabilities published in Chinese and English studies between 1990 and 2020. They included 75 studies from high-income countries and 23 studies from seven low-income and middle-income countries. The report also showed that violence is more common against children with mental disorders and cognitive or learning disabilities than for children with sensory impairments, physical or mobility limitations, and chronic diseases. “Our findings reveal unacceptable and alarming rates of violence against children with disabilities that cannot be ignored,” said Jane Barlow, professor of evidence based intervention and policy evaluation at the University of Oxford, who co-led the study. Higher rates of violence occurred in low-income countries. Stigma, discrimination, lack of information about disability, and inadequate access to social support for carers were contributory factors, as well as poverty and social isolation, the authors conclude. Zuyi Fang from Beijing Normal University in China and co-lead author, said: “It is clear that low-and middle-income countries, in particular, face additional challenges, fuelled by complex social and economic drivers, and must establish legal frameworks to prevent violence, alongside increasing the capacity of health and social service systems to address the complex needs of children with disabilities and their families.” As the data largely predates the Covid-19 pandemic, the situation today is likely to be much worse, said Tania King, a senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne. Lockdowns and job losses have increased familial stress, while increasing the isolation and risks to vulnerable children, including those with disabilities. “Rates of violence against children with disabilities are likely to have increased during the pandemic,” she said. An estimated 291 million children and adolescents have epilepsy, intellectual disability, vision impairment, or hearing loss, representing about 11% of the global total child and adolescent population. Many millions more have other physical, cognitive and mental disabilities, or chronic diseases. Extrapolating the figures out among this population means about 90 million could have suffered violence. The UN sustainable development goals aim to end all forms of violence against children by 2030. Yet more than 1 billion children are estimated to experience violence – directly or indirectly – each year. Responding to the findings, Vladimir Cuk, executive director of the International Disability Alliance, an umbrella organisation representing 14 international and regional disability charities and NGOs, said: “It is not surprising that children with disabilities, especially those in residential institutions, experience all sorts of violence and mistreatment at a higher rate than others. “We could not stress more the need for urgent action by states and relevant stakeholders to prevent these abuses and prosecute perpetrators of violence.”",News/Society,"Almost a third of disabled children and teenagers face abuse, global study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/17/almost-a-third-of-disabled-children-and-teenagers-face-abuse-global-study-finds
