4/18/2022,"Russia's Ministry of Defense said Sunday that Ukrainian forces still defending Mariupol ""will be eliminated"" after they refused another ultimatum to ""voluntarily lay down arms and surrender,"" CNN reports. Per CNN, Ukrainian troops were told to leave Mariupol between 6 a.m. and 1 p.m. local time, leaving all weapons and ammunition behind. The ministry also claimed that the city's remaining defenders had been forbidden to surrender by ""the Kiev nationalist regime."" Last month, The New York Times reported that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ""had told Ukrainian soldiers still holding out"" in Mariupol ""that they could abandon the city to save their own lives."" On Saturday, Zelensky described the situation in Mariupol as ""inhuman"" and ""as severe as possible,"" according to The Hill. Mariupol's mayor claims that over 10,000 of the city's civilian inhabitants have been killed since Russia's siege began early in the invasion. Ukrainian forces, including soldiers from the right-wing Azov Battalion, are making what is likely to be a final stand inside Mariupol's large steel plant. If the city falls, Russia will control an unbroken ""land bridge"" connecting separatist-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine with Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.

4/18/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia is worried about increased activity of NATO forces in the Arctic and sees risks of ""unintended incidents"" occurring in the region, TASS news agency cited Russian ambassador-at-large Nikolai Korchunov as saying on Sunday. In March, Finland and Sweden, which are both considering joining the U.S.-led military NATO alliance, conducted combined NATO military drills. The exercise was long planned, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 added intensity to the war game. Moscow describes its actions in Ukraine as a ""special military operation"". ""The recent increase in NATO's activity in the Arctic is a cause for concern. Another large-scale military exercise of the alliance was recently held in northern Norway. In our view, this does not contribute to the security of the region,"" Korchunov said. According to Korchunov, such activity raises the risk of ""unintended incidents"", which, in addition to security risks, can also cause serious damage to the Arctic ecosystem. He did not specify what type of incident he might be referring to. One of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies warned NATO on Thursday that if Sweden and Finland joined NATO then Russia would deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in a European exclave.

4/18/2022,"By Anushree Fadnavis NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Clashes broke out during a Hindu religious procession in the Indian capital New Delhi on Saturday, injuring several people, including policemen, police said, days after similar religious violence in three states. Eyewitnesses told Reuters that the violence erupted between Muslims and Hindus during the procession in Jahangirpuri, a suburb of New Delhi. Police said they were still investigating. ""We are still assessing how many people are injured... some policemen have also been hurt,"" said Deependra Pathak, a police official in Jahangirpuri, wearing riot gear. The violence broke out during a procession to mark the Hindu festival of Hanuman Jayanti, police said without giving more details. Earlier on Saturday, protesters in New Delhi shouted slogans against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government saying Muslims were violently targeted by authorities in the aftermath of Hindu-Muslim clashes in parts of three states ruled by Modi's Hindu nationalist party. The clashes last Sunday during a religious festival prompted police to impose a curfew in one town and ban gatherings of more than four people in parts of the states. Local authorities tore down the homes and shops of suspected Muslim rioters in central Madhya Pradesh state in the aftermath of violence that broke out during the Hindu festival of Ram Navami, according to a police official who did not want to be named. In Modi's home state, Gujarat, authorities demolished makeshift shops belonging to those they said were involved in the riots in which one man was killed, said an official in Anand district in Gujarat, where the clashes erupted. Police and local authorities told Reuters after the clashes that they were free from bias and acting within the law. Opposition politicians have accused Modi's right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party of stoking tensions between majority Hindus and Muslims in states that it rules. Leaders of 13 opposition parties have issued a joint statement calling for peace and harmony and after the religious clashes. ""We are extremely anguished at the manner in which issues related to food, dress, faith, festivals and language are being deliberately used by sections of the ruling establishment to polarize our society,"" the leaders said. Police in India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh on Friday arrested nine people from a hardline Hindu group suspected of torching the home of a Muslim man who married a Hindu woman.
