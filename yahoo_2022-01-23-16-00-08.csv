1/23/2022,"A New York couple has been arrested and charged after they were filmed launching a hateful rant against a family on a train earlier this month, calling them ""foreigners"" and ""immigrants with no rights."" Justin Likerman, 37, of Ronkonkoma, Long Island, and Kristin Digesaro, 38, of Huntington, Long Island, turned themselves into transit police Wednesday afternoon, MTA police confirmed. Both were charged with endangering the welfare of a child, and Likerman was additionally charged with second-degree aggravated harassment, according to officials. The charges are in collaboration with the Manhattan District Attorney’s office and the Hate Crimes Unit, officials said. The incident unfolded on Jan. 10 aboard a Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) train. Liz Edelkind was with her 10-year-old son, husband and two others, on their way home from a New York Knicks game held at Madison Square Garden, NBC New York reported. They were looking for seats on the train together and asked some passengers to move to accommodate them when Likerman and Digesaro allegedly started to yell. Edelkind told the outlet she believes they were targeted due to her accent and skin color. According to the complaint, Digesaro said, “You f——— immigrants, you have no rights in this country. You have no right to ask anyone to move. You don’t even pay taxes.” Likerman also allegedly said: “F——— foreigners. You take all our resources,” according to the complaint. Likerman was observed holding a beer can in his hand and threw beer from the can in the direction of the family, the complaint stated. “The couple started to verbally attack me, calling me curse words, immigrant, that I don’t pay taxes, that I have no rights in this country,” Edelkind said to NBC New York. In video footage of the rant, Likerman is heard saying, “Look straight, cause I’mma get arrested tonight” and “they’re taking over my f——— country.” “Those words that come out their mouths don’t come out unless you have hatred in your heart,” Edelkind said. “The attack was completely unprovoked, a situation they created.” Likerman and Digesaro were also both axed from their jobs at the Empire Toyota car dealership in Huntington, Long Island, on Jan. 13 after video of their rant circulated on social media and prompted an internal investigation, dealership general manager Keith Drago confirmed to NBC News. The dealership announced the termination in a statement on social media. ""Empire Toyota ownership and management were outraged by the event involving two of its employees on the night of January 10th on the Long Island Railroad. The two employees were suspended when we first heard about this incident, and, as our investigation just concluded, they have been terminated,"" the company wrote last week. ""The heart and soul of our labor force is extremely diverse and we value our employees beyond description,"" the company said. ""We can say without hesitation that whatever occurred on that LIRR train is in no way reflective of our company, its ownership, its management team, nor its employees."" The Manhattan District Attorney’s office said that Likerman and Digesaro were arraigned in criminal court and released on their own recognizance. Likerman is due back in court on Feb. 23 and Digesaro on Jan. 24. Lawyers for Likerman and Digesaro did not immediately respond to NBC News' requests for comment.",U.S./NBC News,"Couple arrested after launching hateful rant against family, including 10-year-old boy, on train",https://news.yahoo.com/couple-arrested-launching-hateful-rant-161817040.html
1/23/2022,"BROOKHAVEN, Ga. (AP) — A stray bullet struck and killed an English astrophysicist while he was inside an Atlanta-area apartment, authorities say. Matthew Willson, 31, of Chertsey, Surrey, England, was visiting his girlfriend in the United States when he was hit by a bullet that pierced the wall of the apartment. The shooting happened early Sunday morning, only three days into his visit. “He was supposed to be here for three months because we’ve been long distance for a while,” Katherine Shepard, his girlfriend of three years, told WSB-TV. “I picked him up from the airport, took him to his favorite eating location, and the next day, he’s gone.” Shepard, whose apartment is in the Atlanta suburb of Brookhaven, who told the television station that the couple woke up on Jan. 16 to the sound of more than 30 gunshots coming from an apartment complex directly behind Shepard’s. A bullet traveled through Shepard’s wall, hitting Willson, she said. “I held him for another 20 minutes while we waited for the ambulance,” she said. “And while we were waiting, there were more gunshots fired.” Police were in the vicinity pursuing reports of gunfire when the 911 call from Shepard came in. Sgt. Jake Kissel of the Brookhaven criminal investigations division said that once officers arrived at the scene, they rendered aid until paramedics arrived. “Dr. Willson was transported to a local trauma center where he succumbed to his injuries,” Kissel said in a statement. The shooting appeared to be a “random act involving individuals participating in the reckless discharge” of firearms. Willson was being mourned by family, friends and his alma mater, the University of Exeter. “Matthew Willson was a former PhD student at the University of Exeter and much-loved member of our astrophysics team,"" a university spokesman said in a statement. No arrests have been announced. Brookhaven police have asked for witnesses or anyone with information about the shooting to contact them or submit an anonymous tip to Crime Stoppers at 404-577-TIPS (8477).",U.S./Associated Press,Stray bullet kills English astrophysicist visiting Atlanta,https://news.yahoo.com/stray-bullet-kills-english-astrophysicist-131033603.html
1/23/2022,"The first pig-heart transplant went to a man who couldn't get on the waiting list for a human heart. Hospitals deemed the patient ineligible because he had previously failed to follow doctors' orders. These subjective criteria leave room for bias — and Black and Hispanic patients receive organs at lower rates. David Bennett Sr. became the first human to have the heart of a genetically modified pig transplanted into his body this month at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore. It was a high-risk, experimental procedure, but Bennett had nothing to lose by the time his surgeon, Dr. Bartley Griffith, suggested the pig heart. More than 106,000 people in the US are on the transplant waiting list for human organs — waiting for the death of a registered organ donor who has a compatible kidney, lung, liver, or heart — according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. Even that's a gamble. On average, 17 people die each day waiting for organs. Bennett never made the list in the first place. In a Newsweek essay about performing the first pig-heart transplant, Griffith described a ""severe obstacle"" that made Bennett ineligible for a human heart: He had a history of being ""medically noncompliant,"" or failing to follow doctors' orders. Other hospitals declined to put Bennett on the national organ waiting list because he'd missed follow-up appointments and didn't take his prescribed medication consistently, Bennett's son told The Washington Post. The Post's report also revealed that Bennett was convicted of a violent crime years ago. Criminal history doesn't factor into hospital decisions about who should get human-organ transplants, but the story stirred up ethical questions about who deserves access to the scarce supply of human organs in the US. The thornier question, medical ethicists say, isn't about crime at all. It's whether a patient's failure to comply with doctor's orders should disqualify them from the national transplant list. On one hand, human organs are an exceptionally scarce resource. Doctors want to give organs to patients who will take care of them. On the other, many patients struggle to follow doctor's orders due to structural barriers, such as poverty or limited access to health care or transportation. Barring them from life-saving organs could reinforce systemic inequalities. Relying on medical compliance to determine who gets care can be a problem, according to Dr. Alyssa Burgart, a transplant anesthesiologist and bioethicist at Stanford University. ""It gets used against women, it gets used against people who are mentally ill, it gets used against people who are not white, it gets used against teenagers,"" Burgart told Insider. ""It's this idea that if you don't do exactly what we doctors tell you to do, then you're a bad person."" Ultimately, the decision to put a patient on the organ waiting list lies with each transplant hospital's selection committee, which typically includes surgeons, doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, social workers, and various specialists. Committees' criteria for organ candidates is often a ""black box,"" Burgart said, meaning standards vary and often aren't shared publicly. There are no nationwide standards for how far a patient can stray from doctor's orders without disqualifying themself from an organ transplant. The US Department of Health and Human Services, which runs the national organ-transplantation network, hasn't issued rules on the subject. However, the agency's organ-transplant ethics committee considered the question of compliance in a white paper, updated last year. The paper details common criteria for organ transplant candidacy: life expectancy, ""injurious"" behaviors like substance use and unhealthy eating, social support for recovery at home, and medical compliance. While giving organs to people who will adhere to a post-transplant treatment plan makes sense, the committee wrote, it's hard to predict which patients will do so. Patients with a history of missing appointments may live far away from their doctor's office, lack access to transportation or time off work, or face financial constraints. Hospitals should consider barriers and offer support when possible, the committee concluded. ""If we're asking patients to do things that are exceptionally challenging for them, certainly we can't be surprised if it doesn't work out 100% of the time,"" Burgart said. There's little data on who gets labeled noncompliant, but Burgart and other experts fear subjective measures reinforce racial inequality: Black and Hispanic patients receive organ transplants at lower rates than their white counterparts. In 2020, 28% of Black patients on the waiting list recieved organ transplants, compared to 30% of Hispanic patients, and 48% of white patients. Structural barriers, like poverty and lack of transportation, which disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic Americans, could explain this disparity. So could racial bias among health workers. In an analysis of medical records from more than 18,400 patients, published Wednesday in the journal Health Affairs, Black patients were more than twice as likely as white patients to have at least one negative word like ""resistant,"" ""challenging,"" or ""noncompliant"" in their records. It's unclear how many appointments Bennett missed or how exactly he failed to follow doctors' instructions. The University of Maryland Medical Center declined to share details about its compliance criteria for organ transplants. But if Bennett doesn't follow doctor's orders after his transplant, he could both endanger his own life and interfere with the study of his experimental procedure. Because of his history, Bennett ""is not your most-likely-to-succeed candidate,"" Arthur Caplan, a bioethics professor at New York University, told Insider. Transplant patients must take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives, in order to prevent their immune system from attacking their new organ. Transplants usually involve follow-up appointments and lab tests, so doctors can monitor the organ and adjust medications. A transplant is ""taking one chronic disease and trading it for another,"" Burgart said. Bennett will be closely monitored during his recovery in the hospital, and later, at a rehabilitation facility, the University of Maryland Medical Center told Insider in a statement. In addition to support from his family, Bennett will receive frequent visits from medical professionals to ensure he takes his medicine and adheres to his medical plan, the University of Maryland Medical Center added. Ultimately, Griffith wrote, Bennett was the right patient for the experimental transplant because he had no other options. If he'd been eligible for a human heart, he wouldn't have been a candidate for a pig heart. Previously, researchers had only connected a genetically engineered pig kidney to a brain-dead human. Though Bennett's transplant has been successful so far, experimental procedures are precarious. It's uncertain whether he will live through the year. Genetically modified pig organs may not become a viable alternative to the human-organ waiting list for many years. But if the technology does succeed, it could save many lives. ""It breaks our hearts to not be able to transplant somebody,"" Burgart said. ""We want patients to live. We want patients to have full and healthy lives. So I do think that transplant programs take this responsibility very, very seriously. And one way to make that better is if we have more organs.""

1/23/2022,"Airplane cabins have cameras that are primarily used for safety and security reasons. Cameras can be placed outside the cockpit so pilots are aware of what's going on outside their cockpit door. Flight attendants can use cameras to view a cabin that might otherwise be obstructed from their seats. It's not at all uncommon to see travelers taking pictures when aboard an airplane as the miracle of flight allows for some remarkable views of the planet. But travelers might be surprised to know that there are times when cameras are watching them during their aerial journeys. Many aircraft cabins are full of cameras that can be used for a variety of purposes, namely safety and security. Here's why aircraft have — and sometimes need — cameras both inside the cabin and along their exteriors. Cameras that show the exterior of an aircraft are primarily tools for pilots and are mostly installed on large aircraft to aid pilots as they maneuver around airports. Airlines can opt to install exterior cameras on modern wide-body aircraft including but not limited to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 XWB that pilots can access through their cockpit display screens. The cameras help pilots properly navigate taxiways, especially during tight turns with which larger aircraft may have a more difficult time maneuvering. Cameras can be placed on the tail of aircraft as well as near the landing gear in the nose of the aircraft, and are essential equipment for behemoth aircraft including the Airbus A380. Passengers also benefit from exterior cameras as they will often have access to them through their in-flight entertainment systems, giving them another option to look outside rather than through the aircraft windows. Cameras primarily let passengers have the same view as their pilots on takeoff and landing, when the runway is directly ahead of the airplane. Exterior cameras, however, often prove to be useless at high altitudes and while flying over water. Top-down cameras can provide clearer images of the ground below but forward-facing cameras may just show blue skies and clouds. But airplane cameras aren't always facing outward. Some are used to look inward to the passenger cabin of an aircraft as flight attendants need to have a way to view their passengers. JetBlue Airways used cameras to solve a problem on one of its newest aircraft, the Airbus A321neoLR that’s used on its flights between New York and London, as well as some flights between New York and Los Angeles. See inside the first JetBlue plane with all-new Mint business class suites which are set to impress on upcoming flights to London Flight attendants sitting in the jumpseat of the forward galley didn't initially have a clear line of sight throughout the Mint business class cabin that stretches as far as 12 rows back on some JetBlue aircraft. The solution, to ensure that flight attendants could see their passengers during takeoff and landing, was a camera accessible through the flight attendant control panel. There's no need for the cameras once the flight is in the air as flight attendants can keep an eye on their passengers while they work and move around the cabin. I flew JetBlue's new London to New York route in Mint business class. It's a premium leisure traveler's dream but some kinks need to be ironed out. Cameras also help maintain cockpit security by allowing pilots to see outside the cockpit door without having to open it, as doing so would jeopardize the security of the flight deck. Cockpit cameras typically focus on the space immediately outside the cockpit door and not on the aircraft cabin. Embraer's E195-E2 demonstration aircraft, for example, has the cockpit camera system set up to show potential customers. I went onboard one of Embraer's newest yet worst-selling jets and can't understand why more airlines aren't buying it. See inside the Embraer E195-E2. Pilots can easily identify themselves when returning from using the lavatory, for example. Otherwise, only a small peephole lets pilots see through the reinforced cockpit door. But not all aircraft have cockpit cameras as their installation is at the discretion of the airline. On the inaugural flight of Breeze Airways in May, for example, the camera monitor in the cockpit was inoperable. Cameras are merely an additional layer of security of which not all airlines have to adopt. Most onboard cameras are discreetly hidden and most travelers won't even realize that they are there. But especially on aircraft that can seat around 500 people, including an Airbus A380, cameras help the flight and cabin crews maintain situational awareness during the flight. Cameras can also be found on aircraft with no passengers at all. Boeing 777 Freighter aircraft flying for Emirates' air cargo division, Emirates SkyCargo, have exterior and interior cameras that can be used to monitor cargo, including while it's being loaded and offloaded from the aircraft. Pilots can view nearly the entire process without having to leave the comfort of the aircraft. Travelers may also find cameras at their seats if flying on aircraft with seat-back entertainment displays. Much like a tablet, some of the screens may have a forward-facing camera aimed directly at a passenger. But, according to CNN, airlines seldom use these seat-back cameras and passengers shouldn't worry about having to be spied on. Source: CNN Flight crews aren't constantly utilizing the cameras found on aircraft but they do help to fill the gaps when needed, especially as aircraft have grown in size over the year and incidents of in-flight violence have plagued the aviation industry.
