1/21/2022,"An American Airlines flight from Miami to London this week turned around and headed back to the U.S. after a passenger refused to wear a face mask. The flight took off at approximately 8 p.m. ET on Wednesday, and it landed again at Miami International Airport approximately 90 minutes later, according to flight trackers. American Airlines spokesperson Curtis Blessing confirmed to USA TODAY that the flight returned to Miami “due to a disruptive customer refusing to comply with the federal mask requirement.” Blessing also confirmed that local law enforcement met the aircraft after it returned to the airport. A Miami-Dade Police Department spokesperson told USA TODAY that a woman in her 40s was escorted off the plane for refusing to wear a face mask. Police have not arrested the woman, and the department spokesperson said American Airlines will handle incident administratively. The woman has been placed on the airline’s list of customers not allowed to fly, pending an investigation from the airline. There were no injuries reported from the incident.

The original flight had 129 passengers and 14 crew members on board. The Transportation Security Administration mandates that travelers wear face masks and coverings on airplanes, trains, and buses and in airports and train stations during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. President Joe Biden last month announced that the mandate will be extended through at least March 18. The rate of unruly passenger incidents reached record highs last year. In 2021, the Federal Aviation Administration received nearly 6,000 reports of unruly passengers, including 4,290 incidents related to masks. The FAA has reported 151 reports of unruly passengers this year as of Tuesday, including 92 incidents related to face masks.

1/21/2022,"A go-kart driver was taking a ride through a snowy Arkansas neighborhood when it appeared to stall at an intersection, surveillance video shows. The driver hopped off and tried to restart the engine when the go-kart took off — all by itself, the video shows. That go-kart then abruptly came to a stop when it crashed into a Centerton home the morning of Saturday, Jan. 15. Video shared by police shows the driver ran up the driveway to get the go-kart and appeared to be pushing it back down when the go-kart once again took off. It dragged the driver along the sidewalk and into a front yard covered in snow. The “incredibly agile, resilient, go kart boogie boarder” managed to flee the scene, according to a post from the Centerton Police Department. Homeowner Sankar Kandhasamy told KNWA the driver caused nearly $1,000 in damage to her garage door and provided the video to police. “He could have reached me, he could have knocked on my door and told me about this incident,” she told the Arkansas TV station. “He simply ran away, so luckily I had a camera.” After sharing the video to Facebook, police said the driver has since been identified. “And no, his name is not Mario,” police added, referencing the Mario Kart racing video game series. Centerton is in northwest Arkansas, about 30 miles north of Fayetteville.
