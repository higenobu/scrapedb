2/20/2022,"The Spain manager Jorge Vilda has hailed Sarina Wiegman’s European title rivals as the “best England team ever” before their Arnold Clark Cup meeting at Carrow Road on Sunday afternoon. “We’ve prepared well for this game, they’ve been training really well and we’ve been doing exercises based on dealing with high intensity opponents,” said Vilda. “I personally believe that this is perhaps the best England team ever. They’ve got plenty of youth in the side, players who play with coverage.”  England host Spain in the second round of the inaugural friendly tournament that includes Germany and Canada and Vilda believes it is “potentially the best game of the tournament”. For the three European teams it is an opportunity to test players and formations before this summer’s Euros, while for the Olympic champions Canada they can ramp up their preparations for the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand next year. Spain conceded in the 88th minute of their opening match against Germany to deny them three points against the eight-time European champions at the Riverside. While Millie Bright’s stunning volley in a blistering first half for England against Canada was undone by a shift of momentum in the second that led to the Manchester City forward Janine Beckie’s equaliser. The rise of Spain on the international stage has been rapid and fuelled by impressive development of the all-conquering Barcelona, with 10 of the 22 player squad and nine of the starting XI against Germany from the Champions League holders. “They have developed very well. We know they have a lot of Barcelona players and they’re very tactical and technical,” said Wiegman, who led the Netherlands to the Euro 2017 title on home soil. “They tied the first game, but before that they won lots of games, so we’re aware. But we also think we have the opportunity to harm them too.” The England manager was coy when asked what she thought about Spain’s Ballon d’Or, Fifa Best and Uefa player of the year Alexia Putellas. “She’s a great player, and a lot of people think she’s a great player,” said Wiegman with a smile. Spain’s fulcrum was more forthcoming in her praise of her team’s opponents on Sunday. “England are a great team, one of the best in the world,” said Putellas. “I always love playing against big teams like them. “I believe that we have improved a lot since [Spain last played England, securing a 1-0 win at] the 2020 SheBelieves Cup. We are a better team now. Tomorrow will be a really tough test. It will be a really high quality contest. We’ll need to be at the top of our game to win. We need to do the little things right.” With a crowd of 8,769 in Middlesbrough for England’s game against Canada, Spain will have a chance to see what it feels like to play in front of a hostile crowd in Norwich. “We need to play well and try and quieten down the crowd because they’ll be a lot of fans on England’s side, like there will be in the Euros this summer,” said Putellas. “That is exactly what we need to do if we’re going to be on the right side of the result come the end of the game tomorrow.” For Wiegman, the result is not the most important thing, with Euro preparations uppermost in her mind. “Of course we want to approach every game to win but also we know this is a step in the preparations for our Euros in the summer,” she said. “So, yes, we want to win, but [against Canada we] had a tie and we just stay neutral because we know we’re working on how we want to take the next step. It’s nice when you win and it gives us a good energy but we shouldn’t be urgent about it because it’s a step in our progress to the Euros.” After Sunday’s double header, England play Germany in the evening game on Wednesday at the Molineux after Spain face Canada, to complete the tournament.

2/20/2022,"The end of the pandemic-fuelled home entertainment boom that has driven record breaking growth for Netflix and its rivals has revealed an uneasy truth – the streaming revolution has peaked. The market is facing a perfect storm as, after a decade of making easy converts, streaming companies are seeing dramatically slower growth and increasing competition fuelling an unsustainable content war, just as stretched household budgets prompt consumers to start cutting back on entertainment services.  Rolling global lockdowns provided the perfect conditions for stratospheric growth. Netflix added a single-year record of 37 million subscribers in 2020, and newcomer Disney+ hit 100 million in 16 months, a feat its rival took a decade to achieve. Rapturous investors sent the market values of both companies to all-time highs late last year. Netflix bumped back to earth last month, forecasting just 2.5 million new subscribers globally in the first quarter, its worst start to a year in over a decade, and confirming that last year it added the fewest subscribers since 2015. Rattled investors, focused on subscriber growth, have wiped almost $300bn (£220bn) off the combined market value of the two giants since last year’s highs. Netflix has traditionally acted as a bellwether for the industry, and its worrying growth slowdown – on the heels of its self-proclaimed strongest content slate ever, with record setters Squid Game, Red Notice and Don’t Look Up – raises questions about the future for peak streaming. Analysts at MoffettNathanson, long-time Netflix sceptics, said the forecast was “worrying” for the rest of the industry. Netflix’s once-revolutionary binge-watching model, the source of much head-scratching by traditional TV companies, is proving a balance-sheet nightmare. The company will increase content spending to an estimated $19bn this year, and there’s a further $23bn on its balance sheet for long-term content costs, plus $14.8bn in long-term debt. Disney, which also owns sports operation ESPN and streaming service Hulu as well as its Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and Disney film businesses, is spending an eye-watering $33bn on content this year. Netflix has scrapped the 30-day free trials loved by binge-watchers, and is finding that even its huge spending is not enough to keep customers loyal, with many unsubscribing after watching big-budget hits. “Squid Game? That’s so last quarter,” said analyst Michael Nathanson in a note to investors last month after shares in the streaming giant suffered their biggest fall in a decade. “The Witcher? Done on New Year’s Eve!”. The new trend, used by Disney+ and Amazon’s Prime Video, is to release episodes of hit shows weekly, to extend the life of content and stop subscribers cancelling after bingeing a few must-see hits. Last year, Apple ditched its attractive offer of a year’s free access to its streaming service with purchases of an Apple device. Netflix, and later Amazon, had almost a decade’s head start, but now traditional media giants are vying for a share of streaming spend, the market is severely overcrowded. The biggest US media groups, from Disney and Sky-owned Comcast to WarnerMedia, ViacomCBS and Discovery, will spend about $140bn on content this year with a heavy focus on streaming services. Globally, content spending is set to pass $240bn, according to Ampere Analysis, all of which will add to the pressure to hold on to subscribers and win new ones. “Everyone has started to feel the heat,” said Dominic Sunnebo of research group Kantar. “As well as a wave of new well-funded subscription services, there is also now an acceleration of advertising-funded low- or even no-cost. The Netflixes are suddenly not so cheap any more.” However, with the wealthier populations of the US, Europe and Australia mostly picked clean of potential subscribers, providers are having to accept that not all customers are financially equal. In markets with huge potential, such as India, consumers are not able or willing to pay much for services, which means price competition is fierce, and subscriber growth brings much smaller revenue increases. Globally, monthly average revenue per Disney+ subscriber is just $4.12, because around 37% of its 118 million base is derived from its ownership of low-cost Indian service Hotstar. In December, Netflix had to cut its standard price in India by almost a quarter to $6.60, and its mobile-only offering to less than $2; in the US and UK its most-popular package costs $15.49 and £9.99 respectively. Newer services such as HBO Max are, however, showing relatively strong early growth. And Disney+, which disappointed investors in November when its final-quarter results revealed the lowest number of new subscribers since its launch, staged a remarkable recovery last week, beating Wall Street expectations to surge to nearly 130 million subscribers at the end of last year. “For now, Disney is defending its position but this isn’t the walk in the park one might expect from a company with a content cupboard already brimming with blockbusters,” said analyst Sophie Lund-Yates of Hargreaves Lansdown. Disney’s stock surged nearly 10% as investors breathed a sigh of relief, hoping that the halcyon days of streaming growth are not over yet. The new golden age of TV is in some ways proving too much of a good thing, with the overload of choice beginning to cause streaming fatigue among consumers. Analysis of the nine major streaming services available in the UK, including ITV Hub, All4 and BBC iPlayer, as well as the US subscription services, found 125,000 hours of content. Given that the typical Briton watches in the order of three hours of TV a day, it would take 86 years to see it all. “The market has got an awful lot more crowded over the past few years and it is not going to support many more services at this stage,” said Richard Broughton, analyst at Ampere. “Consumers now have more services than they could possibly need.” It’s an unlikely scenario, but a viewer who wanted to sign up to streaming services to cover all major entertainment and sports events – from Sky, BT and Virgin to Amazon, Disney and Netflix, with a bit of ad-free ITV Hub+ and specialist streamers such as reality TV service Hayu – and pay the BBC licence fee, would have to spend about £2,000 a year, excluding the cost of broadband. There are signs that consumers are becomingly increasingly selective about how many services they want to manage and pay for. Kantar found that a fifth of German consumers who took out a new subscription video-on-demand service in the final three months last year cancelled one of their existing ones as a result. “Planned cancellation goes up exponentially when people go above three services,” said Sunnebo. “Consumers are not going to keep spending forever: there is a ceiling and that ceiling is coming closer and closer. I don’t think we have reached peak streaming in viewing terms yet, but we are coming close in terms of what people are prepared to pay.”",News/Media,Investors alarmed as streaming services lose their magic touch,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/19/investors-alarmed-as-streaming-services-lose-their-magic-touch
2/20/2022,"The UK’s £6bn film and TV production boom faces being derailed as an acute skills shortage – from set decorators and special effects experts to accountants – causes delays to shooting schedules and drives up the cost of productions for the big and small screen. The streaming wars have fuelled an unprecedented boom in demand for content in the battle to attract new subscribers and viewers, with a record £5.6bn spent making blockbusters such as Mission: Impossible 7, big-budget dramas including Bridgerton and reality shows such as MasterChef in the UK last year.  The huge increase in spending – double the figure for pandemic-hit 2020 and £1.3bn more than in 2019 – has put pressure on the deep-pocketed Hollywood studios and streaming giants to fight for studio space to make sure the production pipeline continues to flow freely. Last week, Amazon’s Prime Video struck a record-breaking deal to lease space at Shepperton Studios, home to productions ranging from Alien to Mary Poppins, in the company’s first long-term commitment to making TV programmes and films in the UK. The streaming giant joins Disney and Netflix, which already have deals in place with Pinewood, home to the James Bond and Star Wars franchises, and Shepperton, as the race for space continues. However, behind the scenes of the British production boom a crisis is looming: sources suggest that a shortage of as many as 40,000 workers will have arisen by 2025 – with shooting schedules already affected. “We are absolutely back and flying,” said Paul Golding, the chief executive of Pinewood Studios, which is also the owner of Shepperton Studios. “I have not in my time seen the studios being used as intensively as they are currently. However, the biggest challenge the industry is facing is crew. Building infrastructure, studio space – that can be done relatively quickly when it is needed. But crew, that is much, much harder. We have been talking about this for a long time.” The British Film Institute (BFI) is in the process of assessing the scale of the skills shortage, at the behest of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, and sources say its report will detail an industry facing a crisis when it is published in April. The skills shortage is not just creating delays to some shooting schedules, it is also fuelling wage inflation as productions fight to secure in-demand crew. ScreenSkills, the body that represents workers in the UK film and TV industry, says there is a particular shortage in the “squeezed middle” of experienced crew. “The really pressing problems are at the experienced mid-level, and that is our big focus in the coming year because shortages there are hitting production schedules, causing delays and creating wage inflation,” said Seetha Kumar, chief executive at ScreenSkills. “All the research we do, and the regular feedback from industry who sit on our skills councils and working groups, [tells] of skills gaps and shortages across the board – from production coordinators and managers to editors, script supervisors and accountants.” There is rising concern that the skills shortage could have an impact on the quality of British-made productions. ScreenSkills’ research has found that crew are being promoted to meet demand before they are ready to handle a more senior role. There is also the growing practice of what is termed “show-jumping”, where crew that are in particularly hot demand leave a production before it is finished because of the offer of better-paid work. For now, the growing skills shortage has not led the UK to lose out to other countries as a location for making Hollywood blockbusters and crown-jewel content for the streaming giants. Amazon is due to start shooting the second series of its $1bn-plus small-screen adaptation of JRR Tolkien’s Lord of The Rings in the UK in the coming months. Amazon made the surprise decision to move filming from New Zealand, the home of all previous Lord of the Rings and Hobbit productions, to the UK last August. “It is great that the UK continues to be seen as a great place to make film and television and that there has been such growth, not just in production spend but in the scale and ambition of what is being made,” said Kumar. “But skills shortages are the biggest risk to continued growth and we think there is an urgent need for an injection of funding. There is no quick fix to this.” ",News/Media,Acute skills shortage threatens British film studios’ production boom ,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/19/acute-skills-shortage-threatens-british-film-studios-production-boom
2/20/2022,"First, the whole foods store shrank to half its previous size, then, in the premises it had vacated, the renovation work began. At first, I thought we were about to get a physiotherapist or a chiropractor: the space seemed somewhat medical, and in the window hung two neons that looked, unlit, like they might be a couple of human spines. But when they were finally switched on a few weeks later, all became clear. In fact, the neons are stylised meat carcasses. It seems there’s now a groovy new butcher at the end of our street. Naturally, I was triumphant about this at first, a feeling that only grew when I Googled to find out more. Stella’s is, apparently, the younger sister of Hill & Szrok in Broadway Market in Hackney, a shop I’ve never visited – I left that part of London in 2004, before its swankification was complete – but which is, according to one source, London’s best butcher by day and a restaurant by night. Stella’s, too, may one day expand to include a “tartare bar”, but for now it is a purveyor of meat from small herds (tick) and a supporter of sustainable farming (tick, tick).  Inevitably, its young staff are also very cool, though this was something I discovered without recourse to the internet: passing by on my way to the post office soon after it opened, I surreptitiously gawped at them swinging their cleavers, and thought how they looked more like bartenders than the butchers of my childhood, who were exclusively bald, ruddy-faced, middle-aged men, and who used to keep jars of free lollies on the counter for well-behaved children. (One of my earliest memories is of standing behind my mother as she bought lamb chops, and making patterns in the sawdust on the floor with my sandals, the better to pass the time until Swizzles’ finest came my way.) But reader, I have a problem. So far (it’s been weeks!) I haven’t bought anything from Stella’s, thrilled though I am by its presence in our hood. I want to, desperately, but hipster butchers are high on the increasingly long list of aspects of our food culture I find painfully intimidating. Not quite so high, perhaps, as cooking for a vegan, which I did the other day – having bought Oatly creme fraiche to dollop on some sautéed mushrooms, I spent the hours before supper in a state of total anxiety that real vegans consider such products, as I think I might do myself, to be the evil work of the biotech industrial complex – but pretty high all the same. The last time I went into a hipster butcher, it did not end well. His face, which was covered with a luxuriant beard, said: oh God, an old woman in search of rabbit. My face, which was suddenly crimson, said: oh God, I’m about to be intensively patronised for assuming that bunnies don’t need to be “pre-ordered”. Because I’ve no wish to look like a walking, talking tomahawk steak the first time the nice people (I’m absolutely sure they are!) at Stella’s clap eyes on me, I’ve spent the past month rehearsing. Round and round the house I go, trying out my lines. “Have you any shin beef?” I mutter first, under my breath. But this won’t do! I should be more assertive. “I would like some shin beef, please, and I don’t want it all to be fat,” I then say in a voice that would certainly be audible above the sound of metal hitting wood. But again, no. Not warm enough. Don’t I want this butcher to be my new best friend? So I try again: “I would like some shin beef for a ragu I plan on making, the one they serve at the restaurant up the road, which is my favourite, when I can get a table there, which I never can, of course, but perhaps you are luckier than me?” But … aargh! These guys don’t want to know the story of my life, and I’m not Miss Bates in Emma (or not yet). On and on it goes. Such agony, and all for a bit of sodding stewing steak. And so, again, I retreat to the freezer in search of supermarket sausages – or anything at all that doesn’t involve the judgment of a hot young man in selvedge jeans.",Lifestyle/Food,My dream butchers opened at the end of the street.

2/20/2022,"Once upon a time, intensive surveillance was a prerogative of states. After the arrival of the internet, and especially the rise of companies such as Google and Facebook, ISPs (internet service providers) and mobile networks, it became a prerogative shared between the state and private companies – corporations that log everything you do online. Surveillance became a kind of public-private partnership. The companies do much of the work and readily cooperate with security agencies when they come armed with a warrant. Way back in 2009 the German Green politician Malte Spitz went to court to obtain the data that his mobile phone operator, Deutsche Telekom, held on him and then collaborated with the newspaper Die Zeit to analyse and visualise it. What emerged was a remarkably detailed timeline of his daily life, a timeline that would have been readily available to state authorities if they had come for it with appropriate legal authorisation.  But in internet time 2009 was aeons ago. Now, intensive surveillance is available to anyone. And you don’t have to be a tech wizard to do it. In mid-January this year, Kashmir Hill, a talented American tech reporter, used three bits of everyday consumer electronics – Apple AirTags, Tiles and a GPS tracker – to track her husband’s every move. He agreed to this in principle, but didn’t realise just how many devices she had planted on him. He found only two of the trackers: a Tile he felt in the breast pocket of his coat and an AirTag in his backpack when he was looking for something else. “It is impossible to find a device that makes no noise and gives no warning,” he said when she showed him the ones he missed. Hill’s report makes for sobering reading. AirTags and Tiles are products sold to help consumers find lost objects. But her experience confirms that these gadgets are also pretty good for tracking people and, being small and unobtrusive, are easy to plant on targets. Of the three Hill used, the GPS tracker was the most intrusive. The manufacturer describes it on Amazon.com as “the ultimate in discreet tracking! Keep track of movement in real time with your very own private eye.” As far as the Hill household was concerned, it certainly delivered on that promise. If you wanted a case study for how a particular piece of technology can be both used and abused, these tracking devices really fit the bill. On the one hand, there are all kinds of excellent uses for gizmos such as AirTags or Tiles. Many people (including me) use them to keep track of frequently mislaid objects such as house keys. On a less mundane level, a German activist, Lilith Wittmann, had a suspicion that a particular mundane government agency was a front for a spy operation, a hunch that was stoutly denied by all concerned. Reasoning that one way of checking might be to see where post addressed to the agency actually wound up, she sent a parcel with an AirTag in it to the agency and watched through Apple’s Find My system as it was delivered via the Berlin sorting centre to a sorting office in Cologne-Ehrenfeld and then appeared at the federal domestic intelligence agency in Cologne. On the other hand, there have been examples of people being followed or stalked using AirTags. And bad actors have also found other malign uses for them, for example, tagging valuable personal property (expensive handbags) as well as cars and bikes targeted for theft. Suddenly, AirTags seem less cool than they appeared when they were launched. Which is doubtless why Apple recently announced a number of new measures and forthcoming technical fixes clearly intended to head off what could become a public-relations nightmare if the abuse of AirTags led to the death or injury of a victim of stalking. Let’s hope that these changes make the tech safer. In the meantime, where did I leave those blasted keys? The ex factorHappy Valentine’s Day from Facebook.

2/20/2022,"Over two previous albums, Brighton band Bird in the Belly have cut a distinctive course, allying musical innovation with the exhumation of obscure songs and overlooked texts, usually with a dark undercurrent of social commentary: Newgate hangings, 19th-century sex work and the like. After the City delves further into antique gloom, being a concept album steeped in pandemic and desolation, complete with the four horsemen of the apocalypse, though the mood and music prove dramatic rather than depressing. Its principal inspiration is the Victorian author Richard Jefferies, celebrated for his nature writings and dystopian novel After London, though the group also draw from the Elizabethan playwright Thomas Nashe and poems lamenting the poverty wrought by the Lancashire cotton famine of the 1860s. Blessed with a couple of multi-instrumentalists, the quartet navigate such unpromising material with flair, mixing lively acoustic folk-rock – opener Tragic Hearts of Towns, for example – with desolate pastoral pieces such as Pale Horse. In Ben Webb and Laura Ward they have two powerful singers, the former’s gravelly tones contrasting and blending with Ward’s clear, melodic voice, which can handle a piece like Smokeless Chimneys pretty much solo. In a culture steeped in dystopias, do we need another? Apparently so. An album of well-realised ambition.
