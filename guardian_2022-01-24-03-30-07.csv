1/24/2022,"Boris Johnson is facing calls to launch an independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory party after the former minister Nusrat Ghani claimed she was told her “Muslimness” was “making colleagues uncomfortable”. The prime minister was dragged into the controversy this weekend as he awaits the findings of a make-or-break investigation into alleged lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street.  No 10 conceded on Sunday that Ghani had raised her concerns personally with Johnson at a meeting in 2020, and said he had responded by encouraging her to make a formal complaint with the Conservative party. A No 10 spokesperson said: “The Conservative party does not tolerate prejudice or discrimination of any kind.” Ghani said she had made clear at the time that she did not think the party complaints process was the right way to tackle her allegations. “He [Johnson] wrote to me that he could not get involved, and suggested I use the internal Conservative party complaint process. This, as I had already pointed out, was very clearly not appropriate for something that happened on government business,” she said. “All I have ever wanted was for his government to take this seriously, investigate properly and ensure no other colleague has to endure this.” Ghani says that when she was sacked as a junior transport minister in a reshuffle in 2020, Tory whips told her that her “Muslim woman minister status was making colleagues feel uncomfortable”. She told the Sunday Times: “It was like being punched in the stomach. I felt humiliated and powerless.” She received public support from the cabinet ministers Nadhim Zahawi and Sajid Javid. Zahawi, the education secretary, called Ghani “a friend, a colleague and a brilliant parliamentarian”, adding: “This has to be investigated properly and racism [rooted] out.” The deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, on Sunday urged Ghani to make a formal complaint to the Conservative party, which she had decided not to do and has now made clear she does not think is appropriate. Calling the allegations “incredibly serious”, Raab declined to say whether he believed his former government colleague, saying he was “not going to get into impugning anyone’s integrity”. Raab said there would be no investigation by the party unless she submitted a formal complaint. The Conservative chief whip, Mark Spencer, has identified himself as the person accused of making the remarks. “These accusations are completely false and I consider them to be defamatory. I have never used those words attributed to me,” he tweeted. An independent inquiry into the Conservative party’s handling of complaints of discrimination said in May last year that there was “clear evidence of a party complaints system in need of overhaul”. Chaired by Prof Swaran Singh, the review pointed to a “lack of transparency in the complaints process, with no clear decision-making process as to how complaints should progress, and no specified timeframes for resolution.” As the row deepened on Sunday, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said it was now time for the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to carry out a full inquiry into the party to determine if any breaches of the law had taken place. Zara Mohammed, the secretary general of the MCB, said: “Nusrat Ghani’s testimony of Islamophobia in the Conservative party is shocking but not surprising. That she is experiencing this as a Muslim woman at the top of the party only reinforces the deep-rooted nature of the problem. Institutional Islamophobia in the Conservative party has gone on with impunity for far too long.” Shockat Patel, a board member of Muslim Engagement and Development (Mend), described Ghani’s allegation as “totally unacceptable” and said her story had “touched a raw nerve” in the Muslim community, particularly among women. He called for the Conservatives to accept the definition of Islamophobia drawn up by the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims, which Labour formally adopted in 2019. “Firstly, we need the Tory party to get their act together and adopt this definition of Islamophobia. Secondly, we need an independent review to specifically address the issue of Islamophobia. The third point is they need education within the Tory party on what constitutes Islamophobia. And this should be delivered by grassroots organisations, which in the past, they have not engaged with,” Patel said. Johnson’s team is anxiously awaiting a report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray on parties held in Downing Street while Covid restrictions were in place. Johnson has admitted attending one event on 20 May 2020 to which his principal private secretary had urged colleagues to “bring your own booze”. The prime minister has insisted he believed it was a work event. Many Tory backbenchers who have not yet called for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister are awaiting the report before deciding whether they believe Johnson’s position is tenable. The Conservative backbencher Michael Fabricant caused fresh controversy on Sunday by saying it was unlikely Ghani was discriminated against for her faith because “she’s hardly someone who’s obviously a Muslim”. In the latest of a series of media appearances apparently aimed at shoring up Johnson’s position, Fabricant told LBC: “I think the whole thing actually stinks, the accusation being made by Nus Ghani. “She’s hardly someone who’s obviously a Muslim. I mean, I had no idea what religion she is. The Labour MP Keith Vaz, who was of south Asian origin, I do know because we discussed it, he’s a Goan Christian; others are Hindus, others are Muslims or whatever. But with her it wasn’t apparent. So it does seem rather a lame excuse to me that she claims she was sacked because of that.” The Labour chair, Anneliese Dodds, accused the Tories of “doubling down” instead of trying to tackle the problems Ghani had raised. “It is shameful that instead of treating allegations of Islamophobia with the seriousness they deserve, the Conservatives have spent the day doubling down and refusing to take action,” she said. “Boris Johnson and the Conservatives’ response has been plain offensive. There needs to be an immediate, independent investigation into these serious allegations.” The behaviour of Tory whips had already been under intense scrutiny in recent days. The Conservative MP William Wragg has claimed several colleagues were threatened with having investment in their constituencies withdrawn if they voted in defiance of the government. Wragg is expected to discuss those allegations with the Metropolitan police this week.",News/Politics,Calls for Tory Islamophobia inquiry as PM drawn into Nusrat Ghani row,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/23/calls-for-tory-islamophobia-inquiry-as-pm-drawn-into-nusrat-ghani-row
1/24/2022,"The unusual foreign office revelation on Saturday night that British intelligence had unmasked a plot to install a Russian puppet government in Ukraine was issued alongside a lengthy release from Downing Street effectively claiming Boris Johnson was now at the helm of an anti-Russian alliance. The release said a deeply engaged Johnson was being briefed daily on the crisis, had ramped up the Whitehall response and was willing to engage directly with Vladimir Putin. It also touted his close personal friendship with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and the number of calls he has made to world leaders in recent days.  The release, promising ministers will be fanning out across Europe and a gear change across Whitehall, sought to give the impression of an animated leader gripping a crisis, some distance from the impression of a broken man unable to shed the travails of Downing Street parties in lockdown. It was confirmed that the defence secretary, Ben Wallace – at Johnson’s instruction – would be travelling to Moscow, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, may go to Kyiv and Moscow, following in the footsteps of the new German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock. Yet the Downing Street release was unusual not just for giving the impression of frenetic activity. For alongside its call for maximum Nato unity, and its insistence that the UK was operating in lockstep with the US, Johnson delivered some pointed barbs against the French and the Germans. The No 10 statement was in diplomatic terms most remarkable for making no attempt to disguise his frustration with his European Nato allies. In a clear reference to remarks made by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the statement said “the prime minister has been clear to counterparts in recent days that now is not the time in the face of spiralling aggression on the border to start a conversation about Europe’s strategic autonomy or radical changes to the European security architecture”. Macron has recently once again raised the idea of a stronger European defence pillar. No 10 said it would be “frankly naive to assume that Russia could be mollified by changes to the European security architecture – the Kremlin’s behaviour has made that consistently clear”. Sources close to Johnson were described as saying he feared that “some world leaders may not appreciate the deteriorating picture on the Ukrainian border, or fully comprehend the risks posed by a bullying Russia”. No 10 did not name these naive countries but did take aim at the German coalition government, pointing out that Johnson in his Mansion House speech in November had broken with the previous approach of polite but muted opposition to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, saying it was “a major strategic problem for European security”. Johnson will also have raised eyebrows in European capitals with his announcement that he was setting up calls with G7 leaders to form a sanctions coalition that would hit “Putin-supporting oligarchs”. His announcement came on the day Transparency International released new figures showing the amount of Russian money in London property is higher than previously thought – £1.5bn, as opposed to the previous estimate of £1bn. Efforts are still underway, currently led by the Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, to set up a public property register in London, but so far the government has dragged its feet about pressing ahead with it. Transparency International UK said it had “identified almost 150 land titles ultimately owned by Russian individuals alleged to be involved in corruption or with links to Putin’s regime. Of the £1.5bn identified, more than £1bn of this is held by companies based in secrecy havens, the majority of these companies are based in UK crown dependencies and overseas territories like the British Virgin Islands and the Isle of Man. The ownership of these firms has only been revealed due to court cases, document leaks and investigations by journalists.” Few can predict the course of the Ukraine crisis, and no one doubts the huge military and ideological support provided by the UK, but at minimum Johnson has a lot of catching up to do before he is taken seriously as the central player in this conflict in the way that Downing Street projects.",News/Politics,No 10 casts Johnson as head of anti-Russian alliance over Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/23/no-10-casts-boris-johnson-as-head-of-anti-russian-alliance-over-ukraine
1/24/2022,"Two-thirds of officials working on the UK government’s flagship levelling up policy are based in London, figures show. Two years since Boris Johnson was elected on a promise to improve what he has described as the “outrage” of glaring regional inequalities, 1,929 out of 3,011 civil servants on the levelling up taskforce are based in the capital.  The largest group of civil servants based outside London are 129 in Wolverhampton, where there is a second HQ for the government’s levelling up department. After that, the largest groups of mandarins working on the policy are in cities such as Birmingham (118), Bristol (88), Leeds (75), Manchester (62) and Newcastle (62). The figures were revealed in response to a written question from the shadow secretary for levelling up, Lisa Nandy. She described the situation as “frankly insulting”. In a speech on civil service reform in June 2020, the secretary for levelling up, Michael Gove, argued that the government could “literally reduce the distance between government and people by relocating government decision-making centres to different parts of our United Kingdom”. He continued: “Why shouldn’t some of the policymakers intimately involved in reshaping our approach to energy and the decarbonisation of our economy be in Teesside, Humberside and Aberdeen? Shouldn’t those thinking about this sector be part of the communities whose jobs depend on getting these decisions right?” Nandy said: “We’ve had quite enough of ministers and civil servants sitting in Whitehall picking winners and losers in our nations and regions. For the department supposed to set this right to adopt the same arrogant approach is frankly insulting.” Although expected in early February, the long-awaited white paper on levelling up has been delayed several times and there is still no fixed date for publication. The latest launch was shelved until after Sue Gray concludes her report on alleged Downing Street parties. Gove has clashed with the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, over whether any new funding should be released. The white paper is understood to include several “missions” on broad topics such as life expectancy and obesity, and ensuring every child has access to a good school. It is also expected to make new proposals for devolution, including extending the mayoral model. The housing minister Eddie Hughes said: “In March 2020, 23% of the department’s workforce was outside of London; we now have 32% of our workforce outside of London.”",News/Politics,"Most of UK’s levelling up taskforce based in London, figures reveal",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/23/most-of-uk-levelling-up-taskforce-based-in-london-figures-reveal
1/24/2022,"The US and its allies will deliver a “swift, severe and united response” if Russia invades Ukraine, the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned on Sunday amid rising tensions.  The top US diplomat’s comments came as Russia continued its military build-up on the Ukraine border and Britain said it had exposed evidence of a plot by Vladimir Putin to install a pro-Moscow government in Kyiv. The Russian president, Blinken said, must choose between the “preferred path of diplomacy and dialogue” or “Russian aggression and massive consequences”. The US, Nato, and Europe stood ready to deal with any eventuality, he said. “We’ve been very clear that if there is any further Russian aggression in terms of sending Russian forces into Ukraine, there will be a swift, severe and united response from the United States and Europe,” Blinken told CBS’s Face the Nation, echoing the message he said he delivered to the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in “frank and substantive” talks in Geneva last week. “We’ve been equally clear that Russia engages in other tactics short of sending forces into Ukraine, or other countries, hybrid actions, cyber attacks, efforts to bring the government down. There, too, I’m confident based on the many consultations I’ve had with European allies and partners that there will be a swift, calibrated and also united response.” Blinken would not say if that response included committing US forces, but told CNN’s State of the Union the alliance was looking at “very practical and important measures”, including military options. “One thing we’ve been clear about, besides the massive economic, financial consequences that would befall Russia if it makes further aggression against Ukraine, is the ongoing, continued build-up of defense capacity in Ukraine and, equally, continuing to build up Nato’s defensive capabilities, including on the so-called eastern flank, the countries near Russia. “A single additional Russian force” going into Ukraine would trigger a response, Blinken said. “We’re looking at every single scenario, preparing for every single one.” With an estimated 125,000 Russian troops at or close to the Ukraine border, western allies have scrambled to bolster military assets in the region. About 90 tons of US equipment arrived in Ukraine this weekend, part of a $200m package of “lethal aid” approved by Joe Biden last month. The UK has sent anti-tank weaponry and personnel to help train Ukraine forces. The Netherlands, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are among nations sending or promising aid, although questions remain over the strength of the alliance and last week’s insistence by White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, that Nato’s 30 member states were “speaking with one voice”. Germany has refused to send weapons, saying it would be “unhelpful” and that Berlin would instead contribute medical resources. Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukraine minister of foreign affairs, responded in a tweet that the result of Germany’s position was to “undermine unity and encourage Vladimir Putin to a new attack on Ukraine”. On NBC’s Meet the Press, Blinken was dismissive. “I sat with Chancellor [Olaf] Scholz just last week for an hour and listened very carefully to him. I’ve been on the phone and saw my own German counterpart, foreign minister [Annalena] Baerbock, and I can tell you that the Germans very much share our concerns, and are resolute and determined to respond swiftly, effectively and in a united way. I have no doubts about that.” Blinken also rebuffed calls from critics, voiced on Sunday by the Iowa Republican Joni Ernst, that the US should impose sanctions on Russia before any invasion took place. “We need to show strength and not be in a position of a doctrine of appeasement, which seems to be how President Biden has worked his administration,” Ernst, a member of the Senate committee on armed services, told CNN. “We do need to go ahead and impose sanctions on Russia now. We need to show them that we mean business and we will be there for Ukraine should they invade. Once an invasion happens, lives are lost. You can’t go back from that.” Blinken said preemptive sanctions would weaken the allies’ position. “The purpose of those sanctions is to deter Russian aggression. So if they’re triggered now you lose the deterrent effect,” he said. “All of the things that we’re doing, including building up in a united way with Europe massive consequences for Russia, is designed to factor into President Putin’s calculus and to deter and dissuade him from taking aggressive action, even as we pursue diplomacy at the same time.” Support for Blinken came from an unexpected quarter, his immediate predecessor as secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, praising a “stronger statement” than that from Biden this week. “I hope they’re serious about this,” the Trump loyalist told Fox News Sunday. “I hope they’re prepared not only to speak about this, and that they have a plan, but they have an execution matrix that sits underneath that so that they are prepared to actually do this in real time. “It doesn’t take days of meetings and discussions with allies and friends to plan to execute a response commensurate with the activity the Russians take.” Pompeo also criticized Biden’s efforts to clarify comments made on Wednesday that a “minor incursion” by Russia would provoke a lesser response. The president later said any “assembled Russian units” moving across the border would be viewed as an invasion. “We need to be unequivocal in diplomacy,” Pompeo said. “If there’s room for doubt, if there’s space, Vladimir Putin will drive a truck through that gap, he will perceive any weakness, any gap, and say, ‘Well, we didn’t send an assembled unit, it was disorganized’.” Striking a note familiar in rightwing US circles, Pompeo also had praise for Putin. Under Trump, he said, “we had respect for him and his power. He’s a very talented statesman. He has lots of gifts. He was a KGB agent, for goodness sakes. He knows how to use power. We should respect that.”",News/World news,"US vows ‘swift, severe and united response’ if Russia invades Ukraine",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/blinken-swift-severe-united-response-russia-invades-ukraine-biden-putin-pompeo
1/24/2022,"It was the kind of individual brilliance which the great Dan Carter might have managed in his all-conquering prime. But Sale Sharks’ loosehead prop Bevan Rodd? When Rodd, who will link up with the England squad in Brighton for a five-day training camp on Monday as they begin preparations for the Six Nations, collected a pass from Ben Curry inside his own half in the 28th minute, a standard carry into contact beckoned.  Instead, the 21-year-old displayed remarkable pace to charge over the halfway line, past a clutch of leaden-footed Ospreys defenders, before finding Arron Reed with a brilliant long pass. Reed raced down the left flank to score but Rodd’s role in the winger’s try was unmistakable. “Bevan’s got it all hasn’t he? It’s that kind of play which sets him apart from the other looseheads – it was outstanding,” said Sale’s director of rugby Alex Sanderson of a player who made his England bow in the autumn. The two other Sale players in Jones’ 36-man Six Nations squad – the scrum-half Raffi Quirke and the openside flanker Tom Curry – also made notable contributions, the latter off the bench after replacing the captain Jono Ross in the 50th minute. Significantly, Sanderson suggested that the Red Rose forward, a player considered indispensable to Jones, could feature in Sale’s Premiership home clash against leaders Leicester on Sunday –just six days before England’s Six Nations opener at Murrayfield. Sanderson said: “Tom enjoyed himself today but he’s got a bit more of a shift to put in next week. There is a chance he might be staying back to get some more game-time. That’s between him and Eddie, but I don’t want to give anything away to Leicester. He hasn’t played a lot in the last couple of weeks. If it does happen, that will be the reason.” After a first half of the season where progress has been slow in the Premiership for Sale, Sanderson can now look forward to a place in the last-16 of the Heineken Champions Cup . After this seven-try success, Sanderson said: “This is a stepping stone towards the final in Marseille. Do I think we can get there? Yes I do, on that performance. On form, we have shown we can beat any side in the land.” Sale always had too much quality for an Ospreys side who fell to their fourth straight pool-stage defeat. Yet they lacked precision during the opening 40 minutes and had three tries chalked off as chances were spurned. Nevertheless, the winger Tom Roebuck claimed his first in the 13th minute when he collected AJ MacGinty’s sumptuous crossfield kick to score in the right corner. Reed then applied the coup de grâce to Rodd’s excellent work before the hooker Ewan Ashman dived over shortly after the interval. Sale began to cut loose and Dan du Preez finished off a scintillating move before Curtis Langdon and Jack Metcalf also touched down while Roebuck added his second. Ospreys were outclassed from start to finish but Toby Booth took heart from the try-scoring performance of the debutant Harri Deaves in the back row. The Welsh region lost fellow flanker Sam Cross to a serious knee injury at the end of the first half. Booth, whose side were missing a number of key players, said: “Sam is in a brace and on crutches and had to have gas and air on the pitch, so it looks like a knee ligament injury. Harri Deaves had an impact on the game and that point of difference was encouraging for him and us. But we didn’t do enough well enough for long enough and ultimately the physics took its toll.”",Sport/Sport,Sanderson hails ‘outstanding’ Rodd after dominant Sale win over Ospreys,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/23/sale-ospreys-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report
1/24/2022,"A livid Patrick Vieira was unsparing in his criticism of the referee, Kevin Friend, and VAR after his Crystal Palace side were beaten 3-1 by Liverpool. Vieira said Friend had been “naive” in awarding a penalty to Diogo Jota late in the game, a decision that he said “took our hope away”.  At the time Palace were 2-1 down and pushing hard for an equaliser that would have changed the complexion of the title race. As it is, Liverpool are now just nine points behind Manchester City with a game in hand. Vieira was also displeased at Liverpool’s second goal, awarded after Friend adjudged that Roberto Firmino was in an offside position but not interfering with play. But it was the late penalty decision that proved most controversial, with multiple replays appearing to show that Jota had changed the direction of his run in order to engineer contact with the goalkeeper, Vicente Guaita. After consulting the monitor, Friend decided to give the penalty. “I don’t even want to talk about it,” Vieira said after the game, before going on to talk about it at some considerable length. “That was a really poor decision from the referee. I looked at it from every angle and I still don’t understand how that can be a penalty. In meetings with the referees they explained to coaches that contact is part of the game, and if there is not obvious contact there is not going to be a penalty. “Here, there was no way Jota – who I believe was really smart, and the referee quite naive – could get the ball back and try to score. That decision took our hope away of getting back into the game and getting a point.” Liverpool’s manager, Jürgen Klopp, claimed not to have watched the incident back. “But I don’t think I have to because we thought it was [a penalty] and the referee did. The Crystal Palace people did not, which I understand. I can’t say anything about it. “It was a big three points for us. The first 35 minutes was some of the best stuff we’d played this season. You could see how good we can be. Someone should have a proper explanation of what happened after. I don’t understand it 100%. In the second half we were not compact. We became sloppy in the last line. All their chances were set up by us, pretty much. We wanted a little break on the pitch, but that was not possible.”",Sport/Football,‘Naive’: Crystal Palace’s Vieira berates referee for Liverpool penalty call,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/23/patrick-vieira-calls-kevin-friend-naive-for-liverpool-penalty-call
1/24/2022,"Nearly half of those who became ill with Covid in the first wave of infections may have long-term and even permanent changes to their sense of smell, according to preliminary research from Sweden. A sudden loss of smell, or an impaired or distorted perception of odours, emerged as an unusual symptom of Covid early on in the pandemic. While many people swiftly recovered, others found that their sense of smell never quite returned to normal.  To find out how common the impairments might be, scientists at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm ran comprehensive tests on 100 individuals who caught Covid in the first wave of infections that swept through Sweden in spring 2020. Their early findings show that 18 months after recovering from Covid, very few people – only 4% – had lost their sense of smell entirely, but a third had a reduced ability to detect odours, and nearly half complained of parosmia, where the sense of smell is distorted. Most of those with a reduced sense of smell were unaware of it before they joined the study. The scientists then ran the same tests on a control group of people who tested negative for Covid antibodies, indicating that they had managed to avoid the virus. About a fifth were found to have similar deficiencies in their sense of smell, implying that smell disorders were common in the general population before Covid struck. Writing in a preprint that has not yet been peer reviewed, the scientists conclude that 65% of those who recovered from Covid displayed either a loss of smell, a reduced sense of smell, or distortions to the sense 18 months after the infection, compared with 20% of those who had not caught the virus. “Given the amount of time since [the] initial insult to the olfactory system, it is likely that these olfactory problems are permanent,” they wrote. The volunteers recruited for the study were healthcare workers who were regularly tested for Covid from the start of the epidemic in Sweden. Because the study focused on people who caught Covid in the first wave, none of the volunteers had been vaccinated at the time. For the same reason, their infections were caused by older versions of the virus, not the Omicron variant that is now spreading rapidly around the world. Analysis by the UK Health Security Agency suggests that a loss of smell or taste is less than half as common with Omicron than the Delta variant, but Dr Johan Lundström, who led the research at the Karolinska Institute, said there was no reliable data demonstrating that Omicron was less dangerous to the olfactory system. A minor loss of smell, or noticing that certain odours smell weird, may not be life changing for many, but Lundström said a severe loss of smell could lead to depression and to people changing their diets, often for the worse, causing them to put on weight. “When you cannot smell, all you can sense is the five basic taste qualities, tactile sensations and spices,” he said. “Unconsciously, people start to add more sugar and fat, or have an increased urge for fried food for the texture, all to get some enjoyment out of eating.” Lundström said the greatest surprise of the study was that nearly half of people who had recovered from Covid reported a distorted sense of smell so long after the infection. “Many of these individuals can get help by doing olfactory training,” he added. “They might not regain 100% of past performance, but most of them will, with training, get back to a point where their reduced sense of smell will not affect their lives.”",News/Society,Half of first-wave Covid cases may have lasting harm to sense of smell,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/23/nearly-half-of-first-wave-covid-cases-may-suffer-lasting-harm-to-sense-of-smell
1/24/2022,"My friend Ros Newman, who has died aged 82, was a sculptor who created human, animal and bird forms – mainly in steel – that were initially for domestic display and later for large public works. Wearing goggles and leather gloves, and with sparks flying everywhere, she created works that were, in her own words, “conceived to deceive the eye into seeing much more than there is”.  Among her most prominent pieces was her stainless steel Flight of Birds at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, rising from and reflecting the waters of a carp pond and providing an oasis of calm for patients, staff and visitors. Ros was born in Highgate, north London, to Ensor Holiday, a scientist, and Betty (nee Rothenstein), an artist. Her maternal grandfather, Sir William Rothenstein, and her uncles, Sir John Rothenstein and Michael Rothenstein, were all artists or art historians. After leaving school at 16, Ros attended Chelsea School of Art in London, working in various disciplines. But it was later, studying at Hammersmith College of Art, that she discovered oxyacetylene welding and developed a technique for creating steel sculptures. “Steel found me and I embraced her with all my passion,” she said. Ros’s first solo exhibition, in London in 1971, at the Alwin gallery, with whom she would have a long association, was so successful that shortly afterwards she bought a barn at Stibbard, Norfolk, converting it into a home and studio. In Stibbard, the local Women’s Institute commissioned a village sign to celebrate its golden jubilee in 1976, and Ros created a piece called The Ploughman, a homage to the area’s rural heritage, which featured a real plough steered by a ploughman made of scrap horseshoes, pitchforks and other agricultural tools and machinery. Later she moved to Norwich, where she taught evening classes and created props for Anglia Television’s Tales of the Unexpected. Ros’s smaller sculptures used mild steel but she turned to stainless steel for larger public works. Flight of Birds was followed by a similar piece for Pensthorpe Natural Park near Fakenham, sometime home of the BBC’s Springwatch programmes, and her Seagulls adorn St George’s Park in Great Yarmouth. She exhibited throughout the UK and also in Taiwan, where she lived for four years in the early 1990s. In 2019 she closed her Norwich studio, passing the torch and other equipment to fellow sculptor Rachael Long. Her lifetime’s work was celebrated with an exhibition, Woman of Steel, at the Fairhurst Gallery in Norwich. Ros was married three times: to Pepe Cavilla and Barry Dawson, from both of whom she was divorced, and to Chris Wade, who died in 2017. She is survived by her daughter, Delphi, from a relationship in the early 1960s with the musician Del Newman (whose surname she adopted), and a granddaughter, Cece.",Arts/Art and design,Ros Newman obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/23/ros-newman-obituary
