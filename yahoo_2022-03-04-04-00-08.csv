3/4/2022,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday issued a dire appeal for help as Russia's attacks across the country intensified. ""The end of the world has arrived,"" Zelensky said during a televised news conference in Kyiv. Zelensky appealed to Western leaders who have resisted calls to set up a no-fly zone over Ukraine. ""If you do not have the power to close the skies, then give me planes,"" he said. The Ukrainian leader also called for direct negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Good Lord, what do you want? Leave our land. If you don't want to leave now, sit down with me at the negotiating table. But not from 30 meters away, like with [French President Emmanuel] Macron and [German Chancellor Olaf] Scholz,” Zelensky said, according to a translation from journalist Max Seddon, the Financial Times’ Moscow bureau chief. The “30 meters” line appears to be a reference to the lengthy table Putin uses for meetings with foreign leaders and his own advisers. “Sit down with me and talk. What are you afraid of? We're no threat to anyone,” Zelensky added. His comments came one week after Putin ordered a military invasion of Ukraine. Russia has since stepped up its assault on key cities after an attempt by its forces to encircle the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv appeared to stall. The New York Times reported Wednesday that Russian troops had seized Kherson, capturing their first major Ukrainian city since the start of the invasion. Zelensky's office denied the report, saying the battle for the port city was ongoing. Battles continue to rage in other Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv and Kharkiv, the two largest population centers, as outnumbered Ukrainian troops mount a ferocious response that has been aided by ordinary citizens wielding Molotov cocktails. Ukrainian and Russian delegations were expected to meet Thursday for a second round of talks in Belarus, but there appeared to be no end to the invasion in sight. Zelensky vowed to continue defending the nation while pleading with NATO countries to help. ""If we are no more, then, God forbid, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia will be next,"" he said.",World/Yahoo News,Zelensky: 'The end of the world has arrived',https://news.yahoo.com/zelenky-ukraine-russia-end-of-the-world-180049216.html

3/4/2022,"The Russian Air Force could soon engage Ukraine at a higher level, a former F-22 fighter pilot told Fox News on Tuesday. ""I think over the next 72 hours, we're going to see a fundamentally different picture for the Ukrainian Air Force, and I'd expect to see more high-level engagement by the Russian Air Force,"" Dan Robinson, a Royal Air Force veteran and former F-22 fighter pilot, said Tuesday evening. Overnight, Russia launched the largest air assault of the invasion so far, according to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Wednesday marked the seventh day of the invasion. Russian forces have increased their attacks on Ukraine's crowded urban areas, including bombing a TV tower in the capital of Kyiv and continued shelling in Kharkiv. RUSSIA LAUNCHES LARGEST AIR ASSAULT OF UKRAINE INVASION: LIVE UPDATES However, the airspace over Ukraine is still contested and Ukrainian air and missile systems remain ""viable and intact,"" a senior U.S. Defense Department official said Tuesday. ""The big thing is, though, what is to come? You have to wonder whether the Russian Air Force will emerge over time,"" Robinson told Fox News. ""That's the real question."" ZELENSKYY CONDEMNS RUSSIAN MISSILE ATTACK ON HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL: 'BEYOND HUMANITY ... DAMN THEM' ""As to why they haven't emerged so far, there's speculation around the actual capability of the Russian Air Force versus the perceived capability of what they have,"" Robinson said. ""There's speculation around a lack of sophisticated precision-guided munitions and targeting pods, which allows a certain degree of standoff and to preserve range,"" he continued. ""Without those, they have to get up close and personal, which drags them to within range of things like Stinger missiles that Ukrainian soldiers can operate on the ground."" Robinson said implementing a no-fly zone above Ukraine would lead to direct conflict between NATO and Russian pilots. ""That is extremely problematic in terms of the escalatory nature of what is what this potentially could be,"" he told Fox News. President Biden has said U.S. forces will not be used inside Ukraine, and there is no consideration for a no-fly zone.",World/Fox News,"Expect air warfare in Ukraine to 'fundamentally' change over next 72 hours, former fighter pilot says",https://news.yahoo.com/expect-air-warfare-ukraine-apos-164245240.html
3/4/2022,"Jenna Ryan served 60 days in a minimum-security prison for participating in the Capitol riot. She said she was denied ""basic human needs"" like a phone and daylight, and slammed COVID-19 rules. Two prison consultants who worked with Ryan told Insider her comments were ""hurtful"" to incarcerated people. Two prison consultants who worked with Capitol rioter Jenna Ryan slammed her for complaining about the 60-day sentence she served at a minimum-security facility, saying she was ""hurting people in real prisons."" The Texas realtor pleaded guilty to a single federal misdemeanor charge of parading on Capitol grounds on January 6, 2021. She started a 60-day sentence at Federal Prison Camp Bryan in Brazos County, Texas, in mid-December, and was released on February 17, 2022. Since then, she has called prison a ""third world country"" and said she was denied ""basic human needs like sunshine, recreation, phone calls, visits"" due to COVID-19 restrictions. She said it was a way for officials to ""sadistically abuse all the inmates,"" without giving further details. Ryan, who said before her sentence that she planned to detox and lose weight during her sentence, also said she ate ""a lot of bologna sandwiches."" She told Insider ahead of her sentence last year that she was learning prison slang and was getting help from prison consultants. But in an interview with KTCK-AM radio in Dallas last month, she said prison wasn't ""anything like the YouTube people said,"" referring to the consultants. Two federal prison consultants she spoke to before her sentence, Dan Wise and Holli Coulman, reacted to her criticism with bemusement and anger. Insider has reviewed email and text correspondence between Ryan and the two consultants to confirm they briefly worked together. Wise, who runs a prison consulting YouTube channel, told Insider that Ryan first reached out to him in November but that he broke contact with her in early December after he realized she wasn't taking ""any accountability for her actions."" Now, he said, ""she's sitting here talking about how she was in a 'third world' prison and it just takes away from all the people that are actually going through something in higher-security prisons."" ""And now the spotlight is on this woman who had to deal with 60 days of incarceration because she stormed the Capitol and made [the insurrection] sound like it wasn't a big deal,"" he added. Wise said Ryan's complaints about her sentence were ""hurting the people that are in real prisons, who are really suffering."" ""The worst thing about her stay in prison was that she had to eat bologna sandwiches,"" Wise added. Coulman, who first started speaking to Ryan in October, also told Insider that her complaints were ""hurtful to incarcerated people."" ""She's going to make it so much harder for anybody now that actually deals with anything rough in the prison system,"" she said. When asked about the COVID-19 restrictions Ryan mentioned, Wise said many prisons had to do what they can to ""keep the spread of the virus down."" ""I 100% explained it would be drastically different and that she should expect severe downtime,"" he added. Coulman said she had warned Ryan that prison regulations might be different due to COVID-19, but that Ryan apparently responded by calling her an ""alarmist."" ""We passed her around in the consulting world and she got a bunch of advice. Yet she didn't listen,"" Coulman said. In an email to Insider, Ryan confirmed having worked with Coulman and Wise and accused them of ""lying about me to the press"" and trying to get their ""15 minutes of fame."" She also doubled down on her claim that she was ""tortured"" in prison. She said the duo's comments ""will not hurt"" her. ""The fact that they warned me and I dismissed them — what was I supposed to do? I couldn't stop the fact that I would be in quarantine,"" she said. ""I acknowledged that it would be horrible. Did they want me to write a song about how their warnings were true? Ridiculous!"" After her release, Ryan said she plans on spending her newfound freedom selling real estate and launching her own YouTube show, which will focus on ""prison reform.""
