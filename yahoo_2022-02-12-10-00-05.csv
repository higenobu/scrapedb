2/12/2022,"A Black FedEx driver says two white men chased and shot at him while he was delivering packages in Mississippi. Carlos Moore, the driver's attorney, told Insider that he asked the FBI to investigate the case as a possible hate crime. According to Moore, he believes that two officers investigating the case on the local level are related to the two suspects. An attorney for a Black FedEx driver, D'Monterrio Gibson, who says he was chased and shot at by two white men in Mississippi told Insider that he asked the FBI to investigate the shooting as a hate crime because the case is being ""home-cooked"" by the local police department. According to the Brookhaven Police Department, father and son Gregory and Brandon Case each face one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and aggravated assault in connection with the alleged attack last month. Gibson's attorney, Carlos Moore, told Insider that he has reason to believe that the assistant police chief and a lead investigator on the case are related to the two suspects. Moore said he is ""very much displeased"" with the ""home-cooking"" that the case is getting from the Brookhaven Police Department. Moore said that he asked the department to recuse itself from the investigation and he wants the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation to take over the investigation on the state level. ""We're asking for the MBI to takeover and the charges be upgraded to attempted murder,"" Moore told Insider. When asked if Moore was confident in the MBI's ability to handle the case, Moore said the agency ""actually could still be too close to the kitchen, so I also asked for the FBI to officially investigate for a hate crime."" More said that the FBI went to the Brookhaven Police Department on Thursday and requested the case file, but it declined to tell him whether or not it is investigating the case. The FBI, BPD, and MBI did not immediately return Insider's requests for comment on Friday. Gibson told reporters on Thursday that he was driving near the Case's home on January 24 because he had put the wrong address into his GPS while he was delivering FedEx packages. Gibson said at a news conference that the Cases shot at him and chased him for around 7 minutes after they spotted him in their neighborhood. Gibson told reporters that he thought the attack was racially motivated. ""I'm from Mississippi, but I never really experienced racism, especially not to this extent, but I'm just looking at everything and way different now,"" Gibson told reporters. Gibson said that he didn't think the Brookhaven Police Department was taking the case seriously from the beginning and police asked him not to speak with the media. According to Gibson, police were too focused on ""worrying about what people thought about Brookhaven."" ""Even the chief emphasized that Brookhaven was so un-racist when that wasn't even the object at hand,"" Gibson told reporters.

2/12/2022,"Greg Nash-Pool/Getty Images Dr. Anthony Fauci A fourth dose of the COVID-19 vaccine might be necessary for some Americans. New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) finds that the mRNA shot's protection begins to decline after about four months, according to a study released Friday. Although vaccine effectiveness against COVID-related hospitalizations was at 91 percent during the first two months after a third dose, it decreased to 78 percent by the fourth month. The study, which was conducted during the Omicron-dominate phase of the pandemic, focused on those who sought medical treatment for COVID symptoms. It did not include a breakdown of age or whether their third dose was a booster or part of their primary inoculation series, which the CDC recommends for some immunocompromised people. ""There may be the need for yet again another boost — in this case, a fourth-dose boost for an individual receiving the mRNA — that could be based on age, as well as underlying conditions,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, told reporters Tuesday. RELATED: U.S. COVID Death Toll Surpasses 900,000: 'Another Tragic Milestone,' Says Biden LUIS ACOSTA/AFP via Getty Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine Fauci clarified that recommendations for a fourth dose will likely not be made ""across the board for everyone,"" adding: ""It very likely will take into account what subset of people have a diminished, or not, protection against the important parameters such as hospitalization."" The CDC's update comes after the COVID-19 death toll in the U.S. surpassed 900,000 last week, less than two months after it reached 800,000. President Joe Biden urged Americans who hadn't gotten their shots yet to get vaccinated as he marked the tragic milestone. ""Vaccines and boosters have proven incredibly effective, and offer the highest level of protection,"" he said. ""Two hundred and fifty million Americans have stepped up to protect themselves, their families, and their communities by getting at least one shot — and we have saved more than one million American lives as a result."" RELATED VIDEO: Doctor Says Fully Vaccinated People Are Going to Test Positive with Omicron: 'Our New Normal' As of Feb. 11, about 75.8 percent of Americans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 64.3 percent are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC's COVID Data Tracker. Just 42.7 percent of fully vaccinated people have gotten a booster dose, for which 50.2 percent are eligible. A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control showed that unvaccinated people in the U.S. were 53 times more likely to die of COVID-19 compared to those who are vaccinated and boosted. ""We can save even more lives — and spare countless families from the deepest pain imaginable — if everybody does their part,"" Biden said.

2/12/2022,"Someone shot a deer with an arrow in Washington and it got stuck, photos show. A deer with an arrow in its side was recently spotted wandering a Skagit County neighborhood, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said. Wildlife officers got a call about the deer and went to help. They did not say how long the arrow may have been stuck in the deer’s body. “The deer was located and immobilized so that the injury could be assessed and the arrow removed,” wildlife officials said Feb. 10 on Facebook. Wildlife officials did not say if the deer had any lasting injuries from the arrow, but it was set free in a different location that was “more suitable.” “In the event of a public safety issue, wildlife violation, or an injured or dangerous animal, please call the (Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife) Enforcement office,” officials said. Deer have been known to get tangled or stuck in items as they wander near people. Across the western U.S., deer and elk have been spotted with plastic trash can lids on their heads or tires around their necks. Deer can often become so focused on finding a mate during the winter that they become tangled in ropes, lights and other hanging objects, Colorado wildlife officials said. In some cases, entanglements can become serious for the animal because it could die. It is also extremely stressful for the animal to frantically try freeing itself from whatever it may be wrapped in, wildlife officials said.

2/12/2022,"Life expectancy data from 2019 showed a national average of 78.8 years. Hawaii had the highest life expectancy, at 80.9, and Mississippi had the lowest at 74.4. Most of the states with lower life expectancies were located in the South and had higher poverty rates. A National Vital Statistics Report published Thursday captured a six-year gap in life expectancy between states with the highest and lowest estimates at birth. Based on data collected in 2019, Hawaii had the highest average life expectancy: 80.9 years. On the lower end, Mississippians born in 2019 could expect to live an average of 74.4 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. The national average life expectancy for 2019 was 78.8 — just a fraction of a point up from 2018. Since the center collected these data on the eve of the pandemic, the effects of COVID-19 on life expectancy statistics have yet to be documented. Here's how the states stacked up in 2019: Hawaii's impressive life expectancy is tied to more than just surf and sand. The state also has one of the higher median household incomes, after the District of Columbia, Maryland, and New Jersey. Life expectancy and socioeconomic status tend to follow similar geographic patterns, Elizabeth Arias, the lead author of the CDC report, told NBC. ""Really well-to-do areas had really high life expectancies,"" she told the outlet, noting that just nine percent of Hawaii residents lived below the poverty line in 2019. The maps don't line up exactly, but many of the wealthier states had relatively high average life expectancies in the 2019 report and past analyses. The states with the highest life expectancies after Hawaii were California, New York, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Washington state, Colorado and Vermont. With the exception of Vermont, these states' median incomes were between $5,000 to $15,000 higher than the national average in 2019. Most of the states with the lowest average life expectancies were located in the South, according to the 2019 report. West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Ohio made up the lowest percentile along with Mississippi. Many of those states had relatively high percentages of residents living before the national poverty line. NBC reported that Mississippi had the largest portion of people in poverty in 2019: 19.5 percent, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Smoking tobacco is also more prevalent in the South, ABC reported. The South and the Midwest have higher rates of obesity than other regions in the US, according to the CDC, as well as poorer access to healthcare in some southern states. Mississippi, Tennesseee, and Oklahoma have some of the higher uninsured rates in the country, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's State Health Facts. While Mississippi had the lowest life expectancy across populations, West Virginia had the lowest average for women: 77.3 years. However, the report found life expectancy was higher for women in every single state and in Washington, D.C.
