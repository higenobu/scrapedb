4/29/2022,"Gavin Millar, who has died aged 84 from a brain tumour, was a leading light of television arts journalism of the 1960s and 70s before going on to direct work by Alan Bennett, Dennis Potter and Victoria Wood. His richest film was Dreamchild (1985), written by Potter, in which the elderly Alice Liddell (Coral Browne) reflects on her youthful relationship with Charles Dodgson, AKA Lewis Carroll, who used her as the inspiration for Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. As well as shaping complex performances from Browne in her final screen appearance, and Ian Holm as the squirming, tormented Dodgson, Millar negotiated tonal shifts and moral ambiguities that might have foxed a less humane or sensitive film-maker. “I don’t think there is any question but that [Dodgson] was in love with Alice,” he said at the time, “and in every possible sexual way, but without any physical contact … He turned all that passion and emotion into his books, and what she finally grasps is that, whatever the source of that love, it had been expressed in a beautiful manner.” The sudden arrival in the adult Alice’s life of characters from the book, rendered by Jim Henson’s Creature Workshop as mangy, menacing puppets, complicated the mood still further. Millar insisted that the design should take the original John Tenniel illustrations as its starting point but that the result must look “as fierce as we felt an old lady’s nightmares would have made them”. Like the film itself, the puppets were “realistic and un-whimsical”. That went for Browne’s performance; Millar called Browne “hard as nails but full of feeling”. Dreamchild was widely acclaimed. Andrew Sarris in the Village Voice called it “rousing and inspiring”, and chose it as one of the best films of the year. Millar had previously directed an earlier Potter script, Cream in My Coffee, in 1980. That television drama, which starred Peggy Ashcroft and Lionel Jeffries as an unhappily married couple revisiting the scene of an earlier holiday, won the Prix Italia. He directed Bennett’s Intensive Care (1982) as well as one of the writer’s monologues in the second series of Talking Heads (1998), in which Julie Walters played the wife of a suspected murderer. Among Millar’s most widely seen works were his collaborations with Victoria Wood: Pat and Margaret (1994), with Wood and Walters as estranged sisters who are reunited for a television show, and the double Bafta-winning wartime drama Housewife, 49 (2006). Born in Clydebank, near Glasgow, Gavin was the son of Rita (nee Osborne) and Tom Millar, who both worked at the local Singer sewing machine factory. The family moved to the Midlands when Gavin was nine; he was educated in Birmingham at King Edward’s school. After completing his national service in the RAF, he studied English at Christ Church, Oxford (1958-61). There he played Stefano opposite Melvyn Bragg in a production of The Tempest that he later described as “justly neglected”. While on a postgraduate film course at the Slade School of Fine Art, London, in 1962, he met Sylvia Lane after seeing her in a student production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream in Oxford, and they married in 1966. Millar began working in television in 1963 on BBC series including That Was the Week That Was and the current affairs show Tonight. He directed music and arts programmes from the mid-1960s, added a section to the 1968 edition of the director Karel Reisz’s book The Technique of Film Editing, and was film critic of the Listener magazine from 1970 to 1984; he also presented or directed film programmes including The First Picture Show, Talking Pictures and the Arena Cinema strand. These documentaries brought him into contact with many of the towering auteurs of world cinema, including Woody Allen, Federico Fellini, Jean Renoir and François Truffaut. His ubiquity in the arts landscape led to him becoming a target for parody. The second series of Monty Python’s Flying Circus, broadcast in 1970, featured a pompous critic, played by John Cleese and named “Gavin Millaaarrrrr” – the “R” is absurdly extended – who refers to “clever people like me who talk loudly in restaurants”. This was a source of lasting amusement to Millar and his family. His daughter Isabel said that the portrayal chimed with her father’s own “self-parody of the Oxford intellectual. As a working-class Scot, he had a certain ironic distance from that ‘posh English’ man that he became.” The sketch also appeared on the 1971 album Another Monty Python Record. Along with Dreamchild, Millar made two other films for cinema: a warm, enchanting take on Roald Dahl’s Danny, the Champion of the World (1989), starring Jeremy Irons and his 11-year-old son, Samuel, and an adaptation of Iain Banks’s thriller Complicity (2000), which followed Millar’s acclaimed four-part BBC version of Banks’s The Crow Road (1996). Other notable TV work included Evelyn Waugh’s Scoop (1987) for London Weekend Television. Millar won an ACE award for Tidy Endings (1988), based on Harvey Fierstein’s play Safe Sex, with Fierstein as a man who befriends his late lover’s widow, played by Stockard Channing. He also directed Denholm Elliott as John Le Carré’s spy hero George Smiley in A Murder of Quality (1991) and Kristin Scott Thomas in the three-part drama Belle Époque (1995), as well as episodes of The Ruth Rendell Mysteries (1996) and Foyle’s War (2004-07). His last film, Albert Schweitzer (2009), starred Jeroen Krabbé as the theologian and physician in later life. Sylvia died in 2012, and he is survived by their five children, James, Tommy, Duncan, Kirstie and Isabel, and six grandchildren, Florence, Martha, Louis, Iris, Arwen and Gavin.

4/29/2022,"On Wednesday evening, Jimmy Kimmel celebrated the words of Anthony Fauci, who said on Tuesday the US is no longer in the “pandemic phase” of Covid-19 as cases decline. “We are now transitioning from the pandemic phase to the awkward teenage phase,” Kimmel joked. “So instead of your hands, wash your face.” “And yet there are hundreds of nuts out there still spreading nonsense, touting unproven, ineffective medications, calling for Dr Fauci’s head,” he added. One of those people is Kari Lake, gubernatorial candidate in Arizona, who in a campaign speech called for ivermectin, a horse dewormer not recommended as a treatment for Covid, to be made widely available and promised to issue a warrant for Fauci’s arrest. “We’re at the point I was fearing that we’d reach, where Donald Trump is almost mainstream,” Kimmel said. “He’s like the moderate now. Mitt Romney’s a hippie, Trump’s the moderate, and then we have all these crazies. Trump being president was like opening Tandora’s box. There are so many genuinely frightening individuals running for office.” Kimmel also picked on another favorite target: Trump’s floundering app Truth Social, his supposed copycat to Twitter, where he hasn’t posted since its launch day in February. “The last time he ignored something this much, it was named Eric,” Kimmel quipped. Truth Social’s selling point has been “free speech” – “they won’t ban you like Twitter did to Trump,” Kimmel explained. “But if you go through their community guidelines, which we did, you will see that isn’t necessarily true.” Truth Social claims to report content that misrepresents a business, “like, for instance, this tweet Trump posted about Dominion voting machines” as part of his misinformation campaign after the 2020 election. (Dominion has filed a $1.3bn defamation lawsuit against several Trump allies.) The company also says it will delete accounts that use Truth Social “for crime or any other unlawful acts”, such as “I don’t know, starting a riot at the Capitol, maybe?” Kimmel noted. “What I’m wondering is maybe this is why Trump hasn’t been posting on Truth Social. He’s banned from that one, too!” On Late Night, Seth Meyers swatted down Trump’s claim that he wouldn’t return to Elon Musk’s Twitter if allowed. “I’m sorry, but there’s no way Trump won’t immediately go back to tweeting if he’s given the chance,” Meyers said. “Trump doesn’t have the self-restraint to stay off Twitter. Offering his Twitter back is like offering Keith Richards a cigarette.” “While banning Trump from Twitter has always been complicated,” he noted, “I think it would be terrible, certainly for me, if Trump got his Twitter back, mainly because not having him on Twitter has just been a huge quality of life improvement.” Meyers also mocked Truth Social, after chief executive and former congressman Devin Nunes appeared on Fox News and practically begged the hosts to join the site. “Every time you think your life is bad, just remember: you could be a former Congressman begging Brian Kilmeade, a man with the eyes of a cabbage patch doll, to send out truths,” Meyers noted. Fox News host Steve Doocy told Nunes, on-air, that he couldn’t join Truth Social because of a waitlist. “A waiting list? Isn’t the whole point of the internet that everything is instant?” Meyers said. “This is like if you clicked on Apple maps and it was just a list of places where you could buy a map.” Dr. Fauci declares America’s pandemic phase over…ish? pic.twitter.com/2KIx6iKw7H And on The Daily Show, Trevor Noah cheered for Fauci’s “out of the pandemic phase comment” with a half-hearted drop of deflated balloons. “Don’t let these balloons fool you,” he said. “This doesn’t mean we’re out of the pandemic. A lot of people misinterpreted this news today. They were like, ‘the pandemic is over! Time to tongue-kiss my grandmother again!’” “But that’s not what this means,” he continued. “What Fauci was saying is that America is currently not in a ‘pandemic phase,’ as in: not a pandemic right now but it’s not over. It could come back. Or it could go away. But it could come back. Or go – you don’t know. It’s a phase. It’s sort of like wide-leg jeans. They disappeared for 20 years, and now suddenly everyone looks like they had to borrow a pair of pants from Shaq.” “But as much as you want to get angry at people, here’s the thing: Dr Fauci, how do you not know by now how stupid people are?” he wondered. “We’re all stupid. You can’t just say ‘Oh, pandemic phase is over!’ All we hear is ‘Party time!’”",Arts/Culture,Jimmy Kimmel on the midterms: ‘Trump is like the moderate now’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/28/jimmy-kimmel-trump-midterms-late-night-tv
4/29/2022,"The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is playing with fire. On Wednesday night she described Russia’s Vladimir Putin as a “rogue operator” lacking rationality, and with “no interest in international norms”. As a result, she said: “We will keep going further and faster to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine.” She is clearly revelling in her imagined proxy war on the Russian bear and no one in Whitehall appears able to restrain her. The use of the word “we” publicly identifies Britain’s interests with Kyiv’s. Truss calls for ever more economic and military aid to be sent to Ukraine, and such aid now teeters on the brink of overt engagement with Russia. She appears to want Russia’s other dissident neighbours, Moldova and Georgia, to join the alliance. Though Putin is irrational and unreliable, Truss argues that he is susceptible to deterrence and will not react recklessly to her escalating belligerence. She nowhere mentions the risk involved in her desired escalation, let alone the possible compromises of peace. Hers is tabloid diplomacy. Before his stunt visit to Kyiv this month, Boris Johnson also instructed Volodymyr Zelenskiy not to make any concessions to Putin, a line Truss is clearly seeking to rival. It is not unknown for democratic leaders to play war games to excite their electorates, but this must be the first Tory leadership contest fought on the frontiers of Russia. It is hard to imagine a more delicate and dangerous time for such antics than now. Ukraine is seeing some of the most appalling atrocities since the second world war and the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. There is no conceivable excuse for what Putin is doing to his neighbour. But the burning issue is not the awfulness of war. It is what can be done to stop it. It naturally suits a desperate Ukraine to claim the present conflict threatens to spill beyond its borders and into Europe more broadly. In reality, Ukraine has for eight years experienced a separatist conflict. That conflict did not necessitate the involvement of the rest of Europe or the US. But Truss declares that Putin wants to inflict “untold further misery across Europe”. She offers no evidence for what is a gross and alarmist assumption, with the implied need for western military retaliation. Putin may be a monster and a liar and we are right to send aid to the people he oppresses, but a strategist should look beyond insults to assess risks and probabilities on the ground. This moment of maximum danger demands all the judgment and skill that narrowly resolved Cuba in 1962. We should remember then that both sides had to climb down. So far in this dispute, Nato has operated with impressive self-discipline. It has laid down the parameters of its aid to Ukraine and stuck to them. Two decades of highly provocative Nato encirclement of Russia halted at Georgia and Ukraine in the knowledge that going further would permanently inflame Moscow. Nato stayed aloof from Russia’s Crimea and Donbas occupations. Putin’s assault on Kyiv this spring was of a different order, but again Nato calibrated its response. It was able to present a united front to Russia while not inviting Moscow to retaliate beyond Ukraine’s borders. Neither western sanctions nor military aid to Ukraine appear to have deterred Putin one iota. They have vastly increased the cost to Russia of his invasion, but as western democracies know well, the cost of military adventures doesn’t always impact policy. Putin will settle as and when he feels he has reached his military limit, which is why there is good reason for sending Kyiv weapons. It is also a reason for the common humanity of welcoming Ukrainian refugees, which Johnson’s immigration policy has hypocritically denied. None of this is a reason for willing the conflict to continue, let alone risking Nato being drawn into the fight. Apart from anything else, a war with Nato would hugely reinforce Putin’s domestic popularity. As was indicated in the Minsk negotiations of 2015 and mooted in Istanbul in March, there will have to be compromise if this is not to become an ongoing agony. An eventual deal will have to embrace Ukraine’s security and a degree of autonomy for Donbas. This will be messy. It cannot award Putin victory but it would probably acknowledge the “Russian-ness” of Crimea and south-east Ukraine, if not of Odesa. There have been indications that Zelenskiy will accept something of this sort. Yet it is precisely such an outcome that Johnson and Truss now oppose, hoping to boost support from belligerents – and defence lobbyists – within the Tory party. The cruelties inflicted by states on other states should always be condemned by the wider world. But condemnation is one thing, fighting another. When states interfere in the affairs of others it is usually, if not always, bloody and unsuccessful. Ukraine appears to be approaching what could be a final battle with Russia in the south, possibly followed by stalemate and some sort of settlement. The worst thing Zelenskiy could face is western allies in the US and Britain both led by politicians, Joe Biden and Johnson, who feel they are too weak domestically to support him in the compromises of peace. Johnson and Truss have not declared that a Ukrainian deal is for Zelenskiy and his people to decide. They want him to keep fighting for as long as it takes for Russia to be utterly defeated. They need a triumph in their proxy war. Meanwhile anyone who disagrees with them can be dismissed as a weakling, a coward or pro-Putin. That this conflict should be hijacked by Britain for a squalid forthcoming leadership contest is sickening.

4/29/2022,"The Dorset teenager Gaia Pope died of hypothermia after either burrowing into undergrowth on an exposed clifftop or falling into the bushes and may have been experiencing a mental health episode or epileptic seizure at the time, an inquest jury has been told. In the hours before she vanished, Pope, 19, said she thought she was pregnant and had split up with her boyfriend before dashing out into “rotten weather” without her coat, the jury heard. The court has been told that Pope was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after reporting being raped at the age of 16. Shortly before she vanished, a man had sent her indecent images, which caused flashbacks and anxiety. On the third day of her inquest in Bournemouth, the Home Office pathologist, Dr Russell Delaney, said Pope had a history of mental health issues and epilepsy. He said on the afternoon of her disappearance, 7 November 2017, she began behaving “irrationally” at a friend’s house in her home town of Swanage and revealed she thought she was pregnant, though a test the day before had proved negative. She also said she had split up with her boyfriend, started acting in a “highly sexualised manner” and undressed. Someone persuaded her to put her clothes back on and she ran away. Delaney said a member of the public found items of her clothing on 16 November in a field around a mile from where she was last seen and close to the spot “deep in undergrowth” where her naked body was eventually found on 18 November. The pathologist said she suffered few obvious external injuries apart from scratches on her torso and legs likely to have been caused by gorse and brambles. Delaney said these could have been caused if she had burrowed into the undergrowth or fallen into it. An internal examination picked up indications that she had died of hypothermia, the court was told. Delaney said Pope may have suffered a mental health episode and taken her clothes off on the clifftop, leading her to becoming cold and wet and suffering hypothermia. It was also possible a phenomenon called “paradoxical undressing” occurred in which a person suffering from hypothermia begins to remove clothes because the brain mistakes the feeling of coldness for warmth. The pathologist told the jury Pope may have exhibited a behaviour called “hide and die”, which is believed to be a primitive response to hypothermia and can involve “burrowing” into an enclosed space. The court was told that Pope had five to 10 seizures a day at one point but Delaney said it was not possible to say if she had a seizure just before she died. Asked on the balance of probabilities if epilepsy had played a part in her death, he replied: “I don’t think it’s possible to say either way. It may have done, it may not have done.” Delaney said death may have taken several hours but could not put a precise time on it. He also said it was not possible to say when she had died – only that it was a number of days before her body was discovered. But he said the characteristics of some of the scratches suggested she died soon after sustaining them. The pathologist said he had been told by police that Pope was due to see her GP at 5pm on the day she disappeared and said a relative had called the police at 6.18pm. Caoilfhionn Gallagher QC, who is representing members of Pope’s family, highlighted that the court has been told that the police were called by a member of the teenager’s family at 3.42pm. Delaney said police had not told him that. Neither was he told that Pope had been due to meet police about the indecent images she had been sent or that her family were worried she had vanished without her medication. The inquest continues.

4/29/2022,"Seven hours of sleep each night is the ideal amount in middle to old age, research suggests. The study of nearly 500,000 adults aged between 38 and 73 found that both too much and too little sleep were linked with worse cognitive performance and mental health, including anxiety and depression. A consistent amount of sleep also appeared to be beneficial. Prof Barbara Sahakian, from Cambridge University’s department of psychiatry, said: “For every hour that you moved away from seven hours you got worse. It’s very clear that the processes that go on in our brain during sleep are very important for maintaining our physical and mental health.” Getting a good night’s sleep, she added, was important at all stages of life, but particularly as people aged. “I think it is as important as getting exercise.” A possible reason for the link between insufficient sleep and cognitive decline may be the disruption of slow-wave, or deep, sleep, which has been shown to be important for memory consolidation. A lack of deep sleep could also prevent the brain from clearing toxins effectively. The study, which used data from the UK Biobank, included brain imaging and genetic data for almost 40,000 of the study participants.It found that the brain area most affected by sleep was the region containing the hippocampus, the brain’s memory centre, with too much or too little sleep linked to a smaller brain volume. The analysis found that people who slept seven hours a night performed best on average on cognitive tests for processing speed, visual attention, memory and problem-solving skills. However, the work could not prove a causal relationship, and the link between sleep and some brain disorders is complex. For instance, unusual sleep patterns and insomnia are a common symptom in people with dementia. The scientists are less clear about why spending eight or more hours in bed could cause problems. One explanation is that people who have poor quality, disturbed sleep, tend to spend longer sleeping – or trying to sleep – because they feel tired. “We don’t really understand why sleeping longer would be a problem,” Sahakian said. Prof Jianfeng Feng, from Fudan University in Shanghai, said: “While we can’t say conclusively that too little or too much sleep causes cognitive problems, our analysis looking at individuals over a longer period of time appears to support this idea. “The reasons why older people have poorer sleep appear to be complex, influenced by a combination of our genetic makeup and the structure of our brains.”The research is published in the journal Nature Aging.",News/Science,"Seven hours’ sleep is ideal amount in middle to old age, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/28/seven-hours-sleep-is-ideal-amount-in-middle-to-old-age-study-finds
4/29/2022,"Joe Biden has asked Congress to approve another $20bn in military aid to Ukraine, significantly ramping up the US contribution to the battle against Russian occupation. Biden will also ask for $8.5bn in economic aid to Kyiv and $3bn in humanitarian relief, as well as funds to help increase US production of food crops and strategic minerals to offset the impact of the war in Ukraine on global supplies. The total request for supplemental spending comes to $33bn. The last supplemental request approved by Congress in March was $13.6bn. Russia has warned that increased western weapons supplies to Ukraine would endanger European security. In a letter to the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, Biden said: “What I want to make clear to the Congress and the American people is this: the cost of failing to stand up to violent aggression in Europe has always been higher than the cost of standing firm against such attacks.” The new military assistance the congressional funding will finance will include. More artillery and armored vehicles, as well as anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft systems. Help to build up Ukraine’s cyber warfare capabilities. More intelligence sharing. Support to increase Ukraine’s ability to produce munitions and strategic minerals. Assistance in clearing landmines and other explosives and in Ukraine’s defence against chemical, biological and dirty bomb attacks. Assistance to clear landmines, improvised explosive devices and other explosives and for defending against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear materials. A further buildup in the US military presence on Nato’s eastern flank. The package of proposals the administration is sending to Congress also includes measures to strengthen the hand of the justice department in pursuing Kremlin-aligned oligarchs. Biden said the measures would allow for “expanded and expedited measures for investigating, prosecuting, and forfeiting assets of Russian oligarchs to be used for the benefit of Ukraine”. Biden made his announcement as the UN secretary general, António Guterres, is visiting Ukraine, where he described the war as “an absurdity” in the 21st century. Guterres was touring Borodianka on Thursday, where Russian forces are accused of massacring civilians before their withdrawal, on his first visit to Ukraine since the start of the invasion on 24 February, before talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “I imagine my family in one of those houses that is now destroyed and black,” said the UN secretary general, who has been criticised for visiting Ukraine only after first meting Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, who rebuffed his offer to help evacuate the devastated southern port city of Mariupol. “I see my granddaughters running away in panic, part of the family eventually killed,” Guterres said. “The war is an absurdity in the 21st century. The war is evil. There is no way a war can be acceptable in the 21st century.” In nearby Bucha, where dozens of civilian bodies, some with their hands tied, were discovered this month, Guterres backed an investigation by the International Criminal Court into possible war crimes in Ukraine. “I appeal to the Russian Federation to accept, to cooperate with the ICC,” he said. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned on Thursday that an increased western supply of heavy weapons to Kyiv – as urged by the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Wednesday – would endanger European security. “The tendency to pump weapons, including heavy weapons, into Ukraine, these are the actions that threaten the security of the continent, provoke instability,” Peskov said in response to Truss’s call for Kyiv’s allies to “ramp up” military production, including tanks and planes, to help Ukraine. Maria Zakharova, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, also warned the west on Thursday to stop encouraging Ukraine to strike at targets inside Russian territory, saying it was “trying our patience”. Multiple targets, including fuel and ammunition depots, have been hit in Russian provinces bordering Ukraine in recent days. “Such aggression against Russia cannot remain without an answer,” Zakharova said. “We would like Kyiv and western capitals to take seriously the statement that further provocation prompting Ukraine to strike against Russian facilities will be met with a harsh response from Russia.” Zakharova added that western envoys in Ukraine would not be immune from Russian retaliatory attacks, saying “advisers from western countries” in Ukraine “will not necessarily be a problem for Russia’s response measures”. The senior Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak defended Ukraine’s right to strike inside Russian, saying: “Ukraine will defend itself in any way, including strikes on the warehouses and bases of the killers in Russia. The world recognises this right.” Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, on Thursday also repeated the UK’s assertion that it was “legitimate under international law” for Ukrainian forces to target Russian logistics infrastructure, but he said such attacks were unlikely to use British weapons. He also denied Nato was locked in a “proxy war” with Russia, but said the west would provide increased support to Ukraine if the Russian attacks continued. “Sometimes that will include planes and tanks,” he said, adding that he expected Putin, “having failed in nearly all his objectives” to dig in “like a cancerous growth”. The US on Thursday accused Russia of planning fake independence votes to justify its conquest of Ukrainian territory, saying the Kremlin might attempt “sham referenda” in southern and eastern areas it had captured using “a well-worn playbook that steals from history’s darkest chapters” and must “never be recognised as legitimate”. As Russia’s assault on Ukraine, now in its 10th week, continues to radically reshape security and economic ties across Europe, Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said non-aligned Finland and Sweden would be welcome in the alliance. “It is, of course, for Finland and Sweden to decide whether they would like to apply for membership in Nato or not,” Stoltenberg said on Thursday. “But if they decide to apply, Finland and Sweden will be welcomed with open arms.” Nordic media said this week the two countries, which are deliberating the question of Nato membership, had agreed to submit simultaneous applications to the US-led alliance in mid-May. Moscow has said that would force it to bolster its defences in the Baltic, including with nuclear weapons, to “restore balance”. The UN refugee agency UNHCR said nearly 5.4 million Ukrainians had fled their country since Russia invaded, with more than 55,000 leaving in the past 24 hours. While the outflow has slowed significantly since March, it forecast that the conflict in Ukraine could produce 8.3 million refugees by the end of the year.",News/US news,Biden asks Congress to approve another $20bn in Ukraine military aid,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/28/joe-biden-ukraine-military-aid-us-congress
4/29/2022,"Eintracht Frankfurt already have one European trophy to their name. They won Euro Vase back in 1980, on away goals, in a two-legged final against Borussia Mönchengladbach, but while The Fiver isn’t knocking it in terms of achievement, on these shores, and in plenty of other areas outside the old Bundesrepublik Deutschland we’ll be bound, that’s not what they’re principally known for. And what they’re principally known for is, having the temerity to take the lead in the 1960 Big (né Li’l) Cup final at Hampden against Real Madrid, who then went on to roll seven goals past the hilariously static Eintracht keeper and Antony Gormley muse Egon Loy. Ach Richard Kress! Was hast du getan! Du hast den Käfig der Bestie erschüttert! Some scholars from the East End of Glasgow may also gleefully recall that 1960 Frankfurt side giving the Pope’s O’Rangers a dreadful smack in the mouth in the semis, beating them 12-4 on aggregate. But it hasn’t been all plain sailing for the German side in European semi-finals over here, as West Ham fans of a certain vintage may remind you. Trevor Brooking was the two-goal hero for the Hammers as they turned around a 2-1 first-leg deficit against Eintracht in the 1976 Cup Winners’ Cup semi with a 3-1 victory at Upton Park. They went on to lose the final, but that’s not the point, and there were two notable things about that win: Brooking, who famously never scored with his head, the 1980 FA Cup final being the exception that proves the rule, scored with his head; and the Frankfurt keeper that night was called Peter Kunter. Yes we are that puerile. This can’t come as a surprise to you. The West Ham of 2022 will hope history augurs well, for they host the Eagles again on Thursday, in the semi-final of Big Vase. While manager David Moyes proved during his time at Everton that you don’t need trophies to be a winner but he is a winner, actually winning one would prove that even more, and he’s just three games from glory now. His team are favourites to establish a first-leg lead at the London Stadium, and while he insists he “hasn’t considered” that status, he must secretly be dreaming of a repeat of the 1976 scoreline at the very least. By comparison, the Pope’s Newc O’Rangers, who in the other semi face Leipzig, German opposition in the last four of European competition once again, are unlikely to seek quite so much inspiration from historical precedent.

The ever-resourceful Ralf Rangnick has somehow found time from the all-consuming task of pointing out his players’ myriad shortcomings and failing to address his own, and reckons Manchester United failing to qualify for Europe under his stewardship might help Erik ten Hag. “It could be an advantage,” he self-exculpated, “but that does not mean we will give away any of the remaining four games.” One to file away: PSG’s Mauricio Pochettino insists both he and Kylian Mbappé will be at the club next season. “100% in both cases,” he tooted. “That is what I can say to you today. I can’t say anything else. That is how I feel right now.” In marked contrast with the men’s team’s recent direction of travel, Barcelona will move up in the world – literally – to Montjuic while the Camp Nou is renovated in 2023-24. Rare good news from the Premier League regarding the launch of a scheme to identify players of South Asian heritage, who are currently underrepresented in club academies. “That shouldn’t be the case and we’re committed to addressing that,” said Neil Saunders, its director of football. “We recognise it isn’t going to happen overnight but we’re committed to a long-term plan.” And there’s also long-overdue positive news emanating from Italy, where players in its top division have finally turned pro. “It’s been a long time coming, but finally, it’s happened,” cheered Elisabetta Vignotto, a celebrated striker who was among Italy’s first female footballers in the 1970s and 80s. “Football without punctuation marks or pause for thought” – no, Jonathan Liew isn’t describing The Fiver’s trademark care and attention, but the Liverpool hurricane that Villarreal ran into.

4/29/2022,"A pet duck has helped authorities in the murder investigation of a missing woman in North Carolina. In 2020, Nellie Sullivan, in her early 90s, disappeared without a trace, prompting authorities to launch an investigation without avail. However, on 14 April , a pet duck ran under a trailer in Candler, North Carolina. Its owners then discovered a container with Sullivan’s remains underneath the trailer. According to Buncombe county sheriff’s office, “Apparently, the duck ran underneath the trailer at 11 Beady Eyed Lane, and as they were chasing after their pet duck, they ran across the container that Nellie Sullivan was located in.” “If I could give that duck a medal, I would,” said Sergeant Mark Walker. The police have charged Sullivan’s 46-year old granddaughter, Angela Wamsley, and her 50-year old grandson-in-law, Mark Alan Barnes, with first degree murder. The pair have been under investigation since December 2020 and were initially charged with animal cruelty and drug possession. However, a year later, Wamsley and Barnes were both charged with concealing a death, according to police. Authorities believe the pair had killed Sullivan in another location before disposing of her body underneath the trailer. Wamsley and Barnes were collecting Sullivan’s cheques, retirement and social security benefits, as well as refilling her prescriptions, said police. The official cause of death of Sullivan has yet to be determined by the medical examiner, Sky News reports. Sullivan would have been 93 years old today. “Since the beginning of this investigation, we have sought to locate Ms Sullivan’s remains, afford her the respect she deserved, and restore dignity to the life she once lived,” said Angie Tullis, captain of the criminal investigation division at Buncombe county’s sheriff’s office. “We are dedicated to utilizing all available science, technology, and investigative skills necessary for justice to be served in this case,” she added. According to court records reviewed by Sky News, the couple’s next court date is on 13 May.",News/World news,Duck finds missing remains in North Carolina murder investigation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/duck-finds-missing-remains-north-carolina-murder
4/29/2022,"“People might say I’m obsessed with the counter-press,” Jürgen Klopp began, going over the 4-0 Anfield win against Manchester United on the Tuesday before last, a game in which there had been so much to admire about his Liverpool team’s performance, particularly in the first half. So much, in fact, that their work off the ball felt almost secondary. Not to Klopp. “The counter-press was absolutely, completely, different level,” the manager continued. So, yes, Jürgen. People might say you are obsessed with it. But there really is no need to be self-conscious because it is worth obsessing over, especially after the latest Anfield illustration on Wednesday night when Villarreal were placed in the chokehold and eventually tapped out. Unai Emery’s minnows had reached the interval of the Champions League semi-final first leg at 0-0 and the manager would profess himself satisfied at how they had defended. But it took a toll; everything does against Liverpool. Take Villarreal’s attempts to play out from the back. There were times when the centre-half Pau Torres looked a picture of composure in possession, stepping up past an opponent, playing a nice pass. Ditto the midfielder Dani Parejo. They helped Villarreal to construct encouraging sequences, even if they felt risky, moments when they withstood the initial waves of Liverpool pressure. They were up and moving. And then you realised that they had not even made it to halfway. And then Liverpool won the ball back. It is draining for opponents, mentally as much as physically, and it said much for Villarreal’s resolve that they did not panic in the first half when the Liverpool counter-press forced turnovers, even high up. They continued to stick to their gameplan – the basic tenet of which was to remain compact in a 4-4-2. But when teams cannot get out, their ambition is crushed. And when the pressure is so intense, it feels inevitable that they will crack, particularly when Liverpool have such varied attacking talents to mete out punishment. When Villarreal did so in the 53rd minute, Jordan Henderson’s cross taking a deflection off Pervis Estupiñán to sail in, they could not shake their heads clear to prevent an immediate second. They did not engage Mohamed Salah – a manifestation of the effects of the onslaught – allowing him to turn and play in Sadio Mané. “We wanted to play a better game over the 90 minutes, create better chances,” Emery said, mindful that his team’s only shot had come late on from the substitute Boulaye Dia, and it was a tame one. “We needed to be able to win the ball and counter or suck them in and get out. We wanted to avoid that heavy pressure and get away from our goal. “However, we didn’t do that as often as we would have liked. It is difficult to get out of the pressure that they put you under. We tried to play our game but they didn’t let us.” The principal positive that Villarreal’s management and players seemed to identify was that it was only 2-0. It could have been worse, already over. Some of them conceded in private that it might have been 5-0. The return next Tuesday at the Estadio de la Cerámica will be different, they believe, in front of their own fans; possibly with the key striker Gerard Moreno back from injury. What if they could score first? They retain hope. They will also draw on how they were able to beat Juventus and Bayern Munich over two legs in the previous rounds. “Liverpool did not feel any threat from us, we have not made them suffer but we know we can create some problems for them,” Emery said. “Next week, we are going to be able to get more out of our attacking play. We will take the game to them more.” The goalkeeper, Geronimo Rulli, promised that he and his teammates would give their lives in the effort to reach the final in Paris against Manchester City or Real Madrid. “No doubt you will see a different Villarreal next Tuesday,” Rulli said. “We have every confidence in the world.” But what is plain is that they will need a remarkable turnaround, something even more dramatic than what they produced in the second legs at Juventus and Bayern, which they had entered at 1-1 and 1-0 up respectively. Emery said Liverpool were a “big step up” from Juventus and Bayern and there is an acknowledgment at Villarreal that Klopp’s squad are on a different level to them in sporting terms. The numbers are against Villarreal. Liverpool have missed only one result that has mattered since 2 January – the 2-2 Premier League draw at Manchester City on 10 April – and the last time they lost by two or more goals was in the 3-1 defeat at Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-final first leg last April. What ought to concern Villarreal even more is the mentality that Klopp has instilled. Juventus and Bayern were overconfident against Villarreal, with Bayern, especially, making it clear that they expected to advance, which served to rile their opponents. There was zero chance of Liverpool being guilty of complacency and so the question is whether they can show the same energy and remorselessness away from Anfield. Klopp said after the first leg that 2-0 was not his favourite scoreline. Then again, his team were 2-0 up at half-time against United and he said the same. He need not have worried.",Sport/Football,Liverpool have opponents in a chokehold thanks to obsessive Klopp | David Hytner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/28/liverpool-jurgen-klopp-villarreal-counter-press
4/29/2022,"A Samsung advertisement featuring a woman jogging alone at 2am has been criticised as “unrealistic” and insensitive. The ad, titled Night Owls, which was promoting the Galaxy Watch4, Galaxy Buds 2 and Galaxy S22 phone, features a young woman running at 2am, with earbuds in, through dark streets and alleyways. At one point she runs past a man on a bike on a deserted bridge.While the young woman is running, the voiceover says: “Sleep at night. Run faster. Push harder. Follow the herd. Not for me, I run on a different schedule: mine.” The advert comes after the death of 23-year-old Ashling Murphy, who was attacked while out running along a canal near Tullamore, west of Dublin, earlier this year, and the murders of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa. Jamie Klingler, the co-founder of Reclaim These Streets, said the ad was “completely and utterly tone deaf, especially in light of Ashling Murphy”.“It’s the Kendall Jenner Pepsi moment for Samsung. It isn’t safe for us to run at night and the last thing I want is for anyone to violate our space while we are trying to exercise. It’s almost laughable how bad this ad lands,” she said. Klingler said it was difficult to imagine a woman who would feel safe running at that time of night, and that was what made the ad “beyond unrealistic”. Sahra-Isha Muhammad-Jones, the founder and head of partnerships of Asra running club, a group for Muslim women, said: “There seems to be an unawareness of how unsafe it is for women running at this time. As a woman who is running, it’s not safe already, but as a Black Muslim woman, it’s even more unsafe. This advert felt like what would happen in an ideal world.” “It can be triggering for women watching this advert and then having to come to terms with what is actually happening in reality to women in this country.” Muhammad-Jones added that the advert felt like a missed opportunity to spark a meaningful discussion on women’s safety. “My first reaction was to laugh. The ad is completely unrealistic and totally blinkered,” says Esther Newman, the editor of Women’s Running magazine. “We have worked for years on the issues of women’s safety when it comes to running and the vast majority of women in our audience have felt unsafe whilst running, from heckling to actual abuse. We know that women often think about stopping running because of this,” says Newman. “Women feel unsafe when it comes to running at any point of the day. Seeing a woman choosing to run at 2am, with headphones, it’s just ludicrous.” Newman said that the ad was not empowering and instead was “shortsighted, naive and comical”. Samsung said: “The Night Owls campaign was designed with a positive message in mind: to celebrate individuality and freedom to exercise at all hours. “It was never our intention to be insensitive to ongoing conversations around women’s safety. As a global company with a diverse workforce, we apologise for how this may have been received.”",News/Society,Samsung ad featuring woman running alone at 2am criticised as ‘naive’,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/28/samsung-ad-featuring-woman-running-alone-at-2am-criticised-as-naive
