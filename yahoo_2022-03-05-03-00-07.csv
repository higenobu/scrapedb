3/5/2022,"By Stine Jacobsen and Johan Ahlander STOCKHOLM/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Russia's invasion of Ukraine has for the first time seen a majority of Swedes in favour of joining NATO, according to a poll, and signs are the political landscape could to change too in a country long known for neutrality. Sweden has not been in a war since 1814 and has built its foreign policy on ""non-participation in military alliances."" It remained neutral throughout World War Two even as neighbouring Nordic countries were invaded, and during the Cold War. A poll on Friday by Demoskop and commissioned by Aftonbladet newspaper showed 51% of Swedes are now in favour of NATO membership, up from 42% in January. People against joining fell to 27% from 37%. It's the first time such a poll has shown a majority in favour. However, Sweden's Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist said joining NATO was not an easy decision, nor one that could be rushed based on recent events alone. ""To change the defence doctrine, that is a very huge decision, so you don't do it overnight and you cannot do it because of opinion polls,"" he told a news conference in Copenhagen where he met his Danish and British counterparts. However, the Sweden Democrats, the third biggest party in parliament, said on Friday it was reviewing its stance, which could give a majority in parliament to those who wish to join. ""We are analyzing the situation now, hour by hour more or less, looking at the NATO issue, looking at other security policy collaborations and what we can do,"" Aron Emilsson, foreign policy spokesperson for the Sweden Democrats told Swedish Radio. ""It is clear that everything is put in a completely different light right now,"" he said. Sweden's centre-right opposition has long called for membership but the Social Democrats, the Left Party, the Greens and the nationalist Sweden Democrats have resisted the move. The shift in opinion echoes that in close ally and NATO non-member Finland, where the head of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs described Russia's attack on Ukraine as a wake-up call and ""Europe's 9/11 for Finns."" Claes Levinsson, director at the Institute for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Uppsala University said the close cooperation between Sweden and Finland, which include joint military drills and materiel purchases, meant that if Finland joined, Sweden probably would too. ""Sweden is closer than ever before to joining NATO but it would need a substantial majority both in parliament and among the people. It would require the Social Democrats changing opinion"", Levinsson said, adding that NATO's process of accepting members could also take time. Sweden and Finland already have very close cooperation with NATO and Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in January the two countries could join the alliance ""very quickly"" if they decided to apply for membership. On Friday he said NATO had decided to strengthen coordination further. ""Both countries are now taking part in all NATO consultations about the crisis,"" Stoltenberg said. Russia, which says it is conducting a ""special operation"" in Ukraine, has warned Sweden and Finland against joining NATO, saying it would lead to ""serious military and political consequences."" Sweden took the decision this month to send weapons to Ukraine, the first time since 1939 Sweden sent weapons to a country at war. On Friday British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said it would be incomprehensible that Britain would not come and support Sweden. ""Sweden is part of the same family so we would stand by Sweden, we would do anything we could to support both militarily and in other ways,"" he said.

3/5/2022,"On Thursday’s Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson admitted that he has been wrong about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This comes after weeks of the Fox News opinion host supporting Russia and defending Russian President Vladimir Putin. Besides defending Putin, Carlson has said on multiple occasions that the U.S. should side with Russia and even said he was rooting for them in the eventual conflict that Russia itself started. Carlson was apparently surprised by Russian aggression. “This situation appears to become more chaotic by the day, possibly even spinning out of control and that, we must be honest, is shocking to us,” Carlson said. “We've been taken by surprise by the whole thing. We’re not the only ones who were, but we’re willing to admit it. The only thing more embarrassing than being wrong in your estimates is pretending that you weren’t.” Carlson has declined to praise Putin or Russia in the days since the invasion began, but he also declined to admit that he was wrong until now despite the Russian military targeting civilians. This only changed on Thursday because Russia began to attack a Ukrainian nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. But Carlson found himself a scapegoat. “Why didn’t we see this coming, this total loss of control? Well, because we assumed that if things were dire, serious people would be involved in fixing them,” Carlson said. “But we looked up and we saw Kamala Harris involved, and that reassured us.” Carlson’s spin to forgive hisdefense of Putin and Russia was to blame the Biden administration while at the same time taking a shot at Vice President Kamala Harris, rather than take responsibility himself. Carlson said that they didn’t take Russia’s military build-up on Ukraine's border seriously because Harris was sent to meet with European allies about the impending conflict. “If the future of Europe and the world hung in the balance, as now so obviously it does, of course, the Biden administration would not have sent Kamala Harris to fix it,” Carlson said, later adding, “That is absolutely not Kamala Harris’s job. That was our assumption. But, as noted, we were wrong.” Tucker Carlson Tonight airs weeknights at 8 p.m. on Fox News Channel. Check out how Tucker Carlson got hammered on Twitter for demanding to see Ketanji Brown Jackson's LSAT score: Tucker Carlson took heat Wednesday night after a segment aired on Tucker Carlson Tonight in which Carlson questioned the academic credentials of President Biden’s Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson. This came just days after he attacked her very nomination, saying she would humiliate the Supreme Court and make the U.S. look like Rwanda. Carlson never had such questions about any of former President Trump’s three nominees, all of whom are white. But for Jackson, Carlson wanted to know what she got on the Law School Admission Test, otherwise known as LSAT.
“So is Ketanji Brown Jackson, that even Joe Biden has trouble pronouncing, one of our top legal minds in the entire country? Certainly hope so. Biden’s right, appointing her is one of his gravest constitutional duties,” Carlson said. “So it might be time for Joe Biden to let us know what Ketanji Brown Jackson’s LSAT score was. How’d she do on the LSATs? Why wouldn’t he tell us that? That would settle the question conclusively as to whether she’s a once-in-a-generation legal talent. It would seem like American’s in a democracy have a right to know that and much more before giving her a lifetime appointment, but we didn’t hear that.”
Twitter took Carlson to task, with many people calling him racist. But DNC chair Jaime Harrison took it upon himself to answer Carlson’s questions about Jackson’s academic prowess. Harrison pointed out that Jackson graduated Magna Cum Laude from Harvard, Cum Laude from Harvard Law and was the editor of the Harvard Law Review.

3/5/2022,"Jimmy Kimmel called out two “congressdemons” for their boorish behavior during President Joe Biden’s first State of the Union speech earlier this week. And he gave them a taste of their own outbursts. Reps. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) heckled Biden during the speech, yelling and chanting at various points. “As irritating as their behavior was, we do have freedom of speech in this country,” Kimmel conceded. “Which means I can remind you that Lauren Boebert is married to a guy who went to jail for showing his penis to a teenager in a bowling alley.” Court documents obtained last year by the New York Post found Jayson Boebert pleaded guilty to public indecency and lewd exposure. Kimmel wasn’t done yet. “Marjorie Taylor Greene spent last weekend speaking at a conference organized by a pro-Putin white nationalist,” he said. “Klan Mom, this woman, has so many issues when it comes to people wearing masks. When it comes to people wearing hoods, none at all.” See more in his Wednesday night monologue: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.",U.S./HuffPost,Jimmy Kimmel Drops Brutal Reality Check On Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene,https://news.yahoo.com/jimmy-kimmel-drops-brutal-reality-074701604.html
3/5/2022,"Young Russian elites are advocating for peace in Ukraine on social media, highlighting the generational divide that threatens Putin's power in Russia. Russian elites publicly protesting the war include the children of oligarchs and government officials close to Putin. Sofia Abramovich is a 26-year-old professional equestrian. In a post to her Instagram story, she said Putin is the one that wants war, not Russia. The post explained that the rhetoric of Russia wanting war was Kremlin propaganda. Sofia’s father Roman Abramovich is the embattled owner of Chelsea FC. Despite accusations, he denies having links to the Kremlin. https://www.instagram.com/p/CYZI_pQrkAb/ Ksenia Sobchak, a socialite and former presidential candidate, has fled Russia and is now in Turkey with her son. Her parents are the former mayor of St. Petersburg and a Russian senator. She has kept advocating, and yesterday posted a picture to Instagram calling for a cease-fire. The caption reads that she is scared and calls on Putin and his government to end the war. https://www.instagram.com/p/CamxdozMf64/ Elizaveta (Lisa) Peskova, the daughter of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also posted to her Instagram account. For a brief hour, a story included the hashtag #notothewar. Peskova is the vice president of the Foundation for the Development of Russian-French Historical Initiatives and appears to be close to her father. Last week, her father stood up for the arrests of protesters saying that by law, rallies are not allowed. https://www.instagram.com/p/CVIlI1rjIDM/ Maria Yumasheva, the granddaughter of former Russian president Boris Yeltsin and daughter of current government advisor Valentin Yumashev, has also shown support for Ukraine. Yumasheva’s father helped Putin come to power by suggesting he would be a great candidate to Yelstin, the former president of Russia. Yumasheva’s latest Instagram post shows a photo of the Ukrainian flag captioned “no war,” and she tweeted the same, according to Yahoo. The 19-year-old attended an anti-war rally in London earlier last week to show her solidarity with Ukrainians. Her fiancé Fedor Smolov, a striker for Dynamo Moscow and Russia, was was one of the first national team players to speak up against the invasion. https://www.instagram.com/p/CaW1gXSrQKW/ Andrey Rublev has also spoken out. The 24-year-old Russian tennis player wrote on the TV camera, “No war please,” after winning a match in Dubai. These young elites are not alone, and many in the world share the sentiment. Rallies around the world have broken out against the Kremlin. In Russia, around 1,700 people have been arrested since the invasion started, and last week someone even wrote “No to War” on the front door of the Russian parliament.

 The Biden administration is weighing whether to impose sanctions against India over its stockpile of and reliance on Russian military equipment as part of the wide-ranging consequences the West is seeking to impose on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Donald Lu, the assistant secretary of State for South Asian affairs, on Thursday told lawmakers in a hearing that the administration is weighing how threatening India's historically close military relationship with Russia is to U.S. security. ""It's a question we're looking at very closely, as the administration is looking at the broader question over whether to apply sanctions under CAATSA or to waive those sanctions,"" Lu said. The Countering American Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, passed in 2017 in the wake of the Kremlin's interference in U.S. elections, includes the authority to sanction transactions with Russian defense or intelligence sectors. The law includes waiver authority for the president that was used for Turkey, an ally in NATO, until December 2020 when the Trump administration imposed sanctions under the law for Ankara's purchase of the Russian S400 missile defense system. In 2016, India was named a ""Major Defense Partner"" with the U.S., a unique designation that serves to elevate defense trade and technology. Defense contracts between the U.S. and India are said to have amounted to $20 billion since 2008. India is also a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with the U.S., Japan and Australia, a grouping that focuses on countering China's ambitions in the Indo-Pacific. President Biden held a video call with Quad leaders on Thursday, according to the White House, ""to discuss the war against Ukraine and its implications for the Indo-Pacific."" Lu told lawmakers that the administration is ""in the process of trying to understand whether defense technology that we are sharing with India today can be adequately safeguarded given India's historical relationship with Russia and its defense sales."" ""It is critical that with any partner, that the United States is able to assure itself that any defense technology we share is sufficiently protected,"" he said. Lu said the administration has been engaged in a ""pitched battle"" with Indian officials over the past couple of months leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. President Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other senior officials in the State Department urged New Delhi to ""to take a clearer position, a position opposed to Russia's action."" The secretary said India's abstention at the United Nations and its commitment to provide Ukraine with humanitarian assistance are promising steps in a shift in its public position and that he expects an even greater shift in the aftermath of outrage at the death of an Indian student killed in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, by Russian bombing in recent days. ""I have had several conversations with Indian officials in the last 24 hours,"" Lu said. ""What we can see, already, very quickly is that action has begun to turn public opinion in India against a country that they perceived as a partner, undeniably, that partner has killed a young person who was an innocent victim in Ukraine.""",World/The Hill,Biden weighing sanctions on India over Russian military stockpiles,https://news.yahoo.com/biden-weighing-sanctions-india-over-153006771.html
