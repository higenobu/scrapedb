5/18/2022,"Scott Morrison has lived up to his self-applied moniker of “bulldozer” by crashing into a young child while playing football on the campaign trail in Tasmania. The prime minister had the mid-match collision with the under-8s player at the Devonport City Soccer Club on Wednesday afternoon. Morrison visited the Strikers club in the Liberal-held marginal seat of Braddon to spruik a $3.5m grant for the club’s Valley Road grounds including a new grandstand. Invited to join in a training match with the under-8s, Morrison ambled around the field amiably while his side scored a goal with little assistance from the prime minister. Morrison then got more active by executing a successful tackle on the wing.

Luca’s coach, Keegan Smith, later told Guardian Australia his young player “jumped up with a big smile and kept playing”. Morrison quipped in the clubhouse: “Where’s Luca? Please tell me he hasn’t gone off to the hospital.” The prime minister also made light of the incident with reference to his recent attempts at self-reinvention when he promised to be more empathic and recognised he could be a “bit of a bulldozer”. “I look forward to coming back on another occasion. I think that when that grandstand comes down, I hear it might need a bit of a bulldozer to knock it down, so I might be able to help with that,” he told the assembled parents and players. Labor’s campaign spokesperson, Jason Clare, made a similar joke at Morrison’s expense.

Johnson was taking part in what was billed as an informal game of street rugby with adults and children on the final day of a trade mission to Japan at the time. On Tuesday, the Liberal MP Gavin Pearce announced a $3.5m grant for the Tasmanian soccer club to undertake a substantial redevelopment of the grounds including lighting and pitch upgrades, construction of a new grandstand, and refurbishment of existing clubroom and kitchen facilities. Pearce holds Braddon on a margin of 3.1%. The Devonport City Soccer Club received $385,000 in the community sport infrastructure grant program, which the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) found was used by the Morrison government to boost its standing in marginal seats ahead of the 2019 election. Last week, Guardian Australia revealed the two major parties had made $40m of commitments to clubs that already benefited from the “sports rorts” program. The Devonport club’s initial grant proposal had received a score of 77.5 which the ANAO found meant it did merit funding.",News/Australia news,‘Please tell me he hasn’t gone to hospital’: Morrison the bulldozer knocks over child while playing soccer,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/please-tell-me-he-hasnt-gone-to-hospital-morrison-the-bulldozer-knocks-over-child-while-playing-soccer
5/18/2022,"Netflix is cutting 150 jobs as the streaming company seeks to reduce its costs after revealing it expects to lose millions of subscribers in the first half of the year. The widely expected cuts are mostly focused on its US operation, affecting employees in its sprawling film and TV divisions. This month, Netflix’s market value was slashed by almost $60bn as investors panicked that the decade-long boom in the streaming sector had come to an end, after the company reported its first loss of subscribers in 10 years. As of December, Netflix had about 11,300 full-time employees, meaning the cuts represent 1.3% of its global workforce. Last month, it laid off about 25 employees in marketing-related jobs, including contractors who had been there less than a year. Netflix, which plans to focus on a “less is more” strategy of fewer but higher-quality commissions of series and films, is estimated to be spending $17bn on making and licensing content this year. The company has said it expects to trim its budgets. “As we explained on earnings, our slowing revenue growth means we are also having to slow our cost growth as a company,” a Netflix spokesperson said. “So sadly, we are letting around 150 employees go today, mostly US-based. “These changes are primarily driven by business needs rather than individual performance … A number of agency contractors have also been impacted by the news announced this morning.” The company has blamed its slowdown on a number of factors including shutting its Russian operation, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It intends to start cracking down on widespread password-sharing among its 221m global subscribers. Netflix, which in several Latin American markets is testing charging a small additional fee to allow households to share their subscription, estimates that its service is shared for free with 100m additional homes globally. The company also intends to launch a cheaper, ad-supported tier this year to attempt to reignite subscriber growth.",News/Media,Netflix cuts 150 jobs after subscriber exodus,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/18/netflix-cuts-jobs-subscriber-us-film-tv-revenue
5/18/2022,"Labour will force a vote in parliament on an emergency budget to help with the cost of living crisis as inflation soared to 9% in April and economists warned of a recession. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said it was “unconscionable” that the government was piling taxes on working people in the middle of a crisis and repeated calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas producers to help with energy bills. “Today’s inflation data will add to the worries families already face as prices soar and pay packets are crunched,” she said. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is coming under intense pressure from his own backbenchers as well as Labour and the Liberal Democrats to give people more help, with calls for tax cuts and higher benefits. Labour called for a VAT cut on energy bills and more help on energy costs for the lowest paid, while Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, called for a VAT cut across the board, saying the “warning lights are all flashing red and Boris Johnson hasn’t a second to lose”. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, acknowledged it was a “very, very difficult situation that families face” in the face of a “severe global economic storm” but declined to say what the chancellor would do about it. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she said: “This is a very, very serious global inflation spike which is having huge effects around the world. “We have made the cuts to petrol duty and the chancellor is working on what more we can do. The important thing is getting economic growth up.” Sunak has repeatedly ruled out an emergency budget and a windfall tax on oil and gas companies profiting from higher prices, but both appear to be back on the table in the face of climbing inflation. One option to avoid an emergency budget would be to promise more tax cuts in the autumn and unveil a package to help with energy costs in the short term. MPs told the Commons on Tuesday that some of their constituents were turning to shoplifting for essentials, while another warned that he had heard of cases of attempted suicide among those who could not afford to make ends meet. Sunak said on Wednesday: “Countries around the world are dealing with rising inflation. Today’s inflation numbers are driven by the energy price cap rise in April, which in turn is driven by higher global energy prices. “We cannot protect people completely from these global challenges but are providing significant support where we can, and stand ready to take further action.”",News/Business,Labour to force vote on emergency budget as UK inflation soars to 9%,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/18/labour-force-vote-emergency-budget-uk-inflation-soars
5/18/2022,"The podcast host Joe Rogan has been widely mocked for wrongly claiming a proposed Australian law tried to stop citizens from growing food, then realising, live on air, that it “might be fake”. In a bizarre rant, the podcaster labelled Australian authorities “fucking creeps” and claimed they were trying to “smoke out” anti-vaxxers. Here are the facts. In an episode of Spotify’s Joe Rogan Experience that aired on 12 May, Rogan claimed to his 11 million listeners “someone”, “I think it was New South Wales”, attempted to pass a law preventing Australians from growing their own food. “I read something briefly and didn’t get into the article,” Rogan began confidently. “But they were saying they were trying to pass a bill that would outlaw you growing your own food in Australia.” “Oh my god,” his guest Bryan ‘Hotep Jesus’ Sharpe cried. Seemingly mocking the Australian officials by speaking in a slow, dopey voice, Rogan continued: “They were saying, ‘Whoa, you could grow your own food. And what else? The disease was from your food. It infects the population, kills us off. Oh, we can’t have that.’” Rogan said he didn’t know what the justification was for the law but he was “pretty sure” it had to do with agricultural contamination. “You could justify it if you were a real piece of shit, you could say most pandemics come from agriculture … fucking creeps man, these fucking creeps, they got a good grip on people during the pandemic,” he lamented. “That’s how you motherfucking smoke out an anti-vaxxer, you can’t even go to the grocery store any more and you can’t grow your own food.” His producer, Jamie Vernon, then Googled the topic, which threw a spanner in the works of Rogan’s rant. “Nothing’s coming up,” he said. “The closest I can find is New Zealand.” “Hold on,” Rogan replied, whipping out his own phone, to no avail. “It’s got to be a real thing … it seems too good to not be … damn it, it better not be fake. “It might be fake.” It appears Rogan got hooked in by a false claim that has been circulating on social media. In a post on Facebook it was suggested Daniel Andrews (the premier of Victoria, not New South Wales), was passing a bill prohibiting people from growing their own food. “The Agriculture Legislation Amendment Bill 2022 has had its second reading in parliament,” the post read. “Biosecurity is stated as the reason for changes.” After this, a YouTuber with more than 75m views tweeted “Australia is passing a bill that will prevent people from growing their own food. Totally normal.” The post was retweeted more than 12,000 times. Reuters found six similar posts across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram echoing the claim. In short, no. Not only did Rogan get the state wrong, but the Victorian government told Guardian Australia the Agriculture Legislation Amendment Bill (2022) won’t prevent anyone from growing their own food. “The Agriculture Legislation Amendment Bill 2022 will help safeguard food security, food safety and access to export markets,” a spokesperson said. The bill which has had a third reading in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, only prohibits the sale of “diseased plants” and “pest animals”. Australia has legislation and regulations to ensure food is safe to eat, enforced by the federal, state and territory governments. They mostly relate to food labelling, commercial storing, handling and serving food and food recalls. Food Standards Australia New Zealand has set the standards since the 90s. Perusing the Food Standards Code, there is one requirement under legislation for fruit and vegetables – that if they are sold in brine, oil or vinegar they must not have a pH greater than 4.6. Not relevant to home gardeners. Rogan has been widely criticised for making numerous disputed claims about the pandemic, lockdowns and Covid vaccinations on his program. And he has a real bent about Australia’s approach to the virus. In November, Rogan posted a satirical advertisement on Instagram that ran on the ABC’s Gruen Transfer program, with the caption: “Not only has Australia had the worst reaction to the pandemic with dystopian, police-state measures that are truly inconceivable to the rest of the civilised world, but they also have the absolute dumbest propaganda.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Later, he added an edit to the post, acknowledging “apparently this is not a real ad. It’s from a satirical show”. The following month, Rogan said he would not get vaccinated as he “had antibodies” and it “doesn’t make sense”. He has also suggested lockdowns “make things worse” as they can perpetuate the spread of Covid-19 because people are “trapped inside”.

5/18/2022,"Despite ultra-low emissions regulations, there are still plenty of diesel vans choking up London’s Euston Road, historically one of the most polluted thoroughfares in the country. It is an apt location for an awareness-raising exhibition in the Wellcome Collection, not exactly a breath of fresh air but a bracing, uplifting and potentially reinvigorating exploration of the surprisingly long history of fighting for breath. In the Air mixes works from contemporary artists including Tacita Dean, Dryden Goodwin and David Rickard, and fascinating archival material revealing earlier battles for clean air which began with Fumifugium, or, The Inconveniencie of the Aer and Smoak of London, a magnificently prescient 1661 pamphlet by John Evelyn which is one of the earliest known writings imploring the authorities to take action against pollution. Air may be the most elusive and challenging of elements to be given artistic form but it is having a moment. Goodwin drew attention to London’s toxic air when sketches of his five-year-old son breathing were projected on to St Thomas’ hospital opposite the Houses of Parliament in 2012. Ten years on, he’s returned to the subject, drawing anti-pollution activists from his home London neighbourhood of Lewisham including Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, whose nine-year-old daughter Ella suffered a fatal asthma attack in 2013, becoming the first person in Britain to have air pollution listed as a cause of her death at her inquest. Six local people – including Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, Anjali Raman-Middleton of clean-air campaigners Choked Up, and Goodwin’s own son, Heath – are filmed taking breath before Goodwin sketches each of the multiple frames in miniature form with a 0.5mm propelling pencil. The vivid, tiny sketches show each activist drawn from the waist up, wearing as little as possible so you see their skin taut over their rib-cage, which somehow conveys the vulnerability of breathing, and the defiance of activism. Goodwin is still drawing for Breathe:2022 which will also feature on advertising hoardings, bus stops and council buildings across Lewisham, culminating in a large public projection of the completed animation of more than 1,000 drawings in November, a collaboration with the arts and science charity Invisible Dust. The project sprang from a deeply personal fear for his five-year-old son. “Drawing my son was about my sense of responsibility for him,” he says. “We’ve chosen for our children to be in this environment.” But he is acutely aware that while he may have chosen to live in Lewisham, others didn’t. “We don’t all breathe the same air. I don’t live that far away from where Ella was so devastatingly affected. I live a few roads back but the difference is huge.” The words of Adoo-Kissi-Debrah will go beneath one of the images: “Do we all breathe the same air?” After the “provocation” of the projection opposite parliament, Goodwin was invited to attend a panel discussion on air pollution hosted by the Environmental Audit Committee. “So I went and it was amazing and I thought, there’s something happening here. Then Joan Walley, an MP who was doing good work on the issue, said ‘you must write to your MP and express these things’ and I thought, but we’re here in the Commons! We’ve got to get on with this stuff!” The government is currently proposing air-quality targets that allow twice as much small-particle pollution in England as the World Health Organization recommends as an upper limit, and this target will not be met until 2040. Is Goodwin dismayed by the lack of progress in the last decade? “It’s so troubling, in fact terrifying, what’s happened in that time. We knew that this was the path we were on,” he says. One of the biggest positive changes, he thinks, sprang from the Ella’s tragic death in his borough which has motivated a new generation of young activists. “The vastness of the scale of air pollution is overwhelming but it’s through the local that the vast scale of the global can be incrementally dealt with. It’s really important that the people I drew this time were active and agents for change.” Visitors to the Wellcome show are greeted by a projection of Tacita Dean’s delightful, vertiginous short film about collecting air in a hot air balloon, and a pile of concrete blocks assembled by David Rickard. A Roomful of Air measures the volume of air in the gallery, calculating the altitude, humidity and temperature – which all affect its weight – and represents this astonishing weight – more than 1,400kg in this particular room – in concrete. “The pressure on our bodies is literally tonnes,” says Rickard, a likable New Zealander based in London who fizzes with ideas for ingenuous collaborations with scientists. “In the sea, there are fish that live in the midnight zone; we live in the midnight zone of the atmosphere – it’s got a huge amount of pressure.” Rickard, like Goodwin, has been making art out of air for more than a decade, ever since Exhaust, in which he sat in a valved mask for 24 hours and collected all the air he breathed in aluminium foil balloons. This eerily beautiful and exhausting performance art typically results in a sculpture of 98 to 102 balloons of Rickard’s breath rising above his meditative figure. Rickard won’t have to complete this marathon for In the Air but is instead showing International Airspace, which turns Dean’s filmic idea of collecting air into reality, with air collected from the 27 original signatories of the 1919 Paris Convention. “We talk about ‘our’ airspace in a national sense – clearly that’s a completely irrelevant way of thinking of it in terms of the atmosphere and the environment,” says Rickard, who was inspired by Caesar’s Last Breath, a book by Sam Kean, which reveals how the air we breathe today circulates around the hemisphere every two weeks, and with every breath we take we inhale one molecule that will have been breathed by Caesar in his final breath. “That’s when we start to realise that this notion of pollution and our changing of the atmosphere is not going to go away,” says Rickard, “and for thousands of years into the future people are going to breathe the pollution we are creating now.” Rickard found collaborators in each 0f the 27 countries, from Belgium to Uruguay, who collected air in special plastic bags and posted boxes of it to him. “It’s pretty inspiring how people will come on board with something as strange as ‘could you collect some air?’” Eventually, air obtained, Rickard released it into elegant glass tubes created by scientific glass-blowers (a dying art – or science – says Rickard) at Leicester University’s school of chemistry. Rickard’s work may not be overtly polemical but he is keen to heighten our awareness of the air that we breathe by showing the materiality of the air, an aim shared by Matterlurgy, the duo of Helena Hunter and Mark Peter Wright, who present a new video installation, Air Morphologies, a collaboration with production studio artsXR. In an immersive, panoramic film developed for the exhibition from a VR headset, visitors encounter gigantic pollution particles – which talk to them about this “toxic ecology”. “An understanding that the air is economic and geopolitical, and shaped by industry and pollution is growing within popular culture,” says Hunter. “For us it was very much about the animation itself and how the voice of the particles address the viewer – this transformation of scientific knowledge into something that is felt, or physical, or more poetic.” While Goodwin’s breathing people are tiny and fragile, a fly ash particle is enlarged to become bigger than a person. “Fly ash particles are produced by coal-fired power plants, and fly ash is the star of the show,” says Wright. “It will address you as the gallery visitor. We really wanted to create an encounter that is slow, that somehow moves and contemplates these toxic realities that underpin life but that we’re rarely aware of. We didn’t want it to be polemical but it’s a very serious topic with lots of gradations of culpability and effect, in terms of who has the right to breathe.” “We wanted to create contemplative space where you can really feel this toxic intimacy and think critically about it,” says Hunter. “The soundtrack creates a sense of mourning and meditation – not in a tuning out way but in a very focused way.” Goodwin hopes that the exhibition’s air art not only focuses minds but also contributes to political action. He believes that the local activists highlighted in Breathe:2022 are being heard by councils and the mayor of London’s office but hopes for change at a higher level. “Rosamund said it’s very important that these [artistic] things happen and there’s a raising of awareness and the invisible is made visible but action has to happen too. There need to be more cycle lanes and limits to pollution must be adhered to. Politicians can’t just think ‘we’ve shown some pictures’. I’m very conscious of art-washing but we have to bloody well do something, and this is what I do.” In The Air is at the Wellcome Collection from Thursday until 16 October",Arts/Art and design,‘I’m very conscious of art-washing but we have to bloody well do something’: the show tackling air pollution,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/18/in-the-air-exhibition-pollution-wellcome-collection
5/18/2022,"As America prepares for a future in which the federal protection of abortion rights is removed as the supreme court appears set to overturn the Roe v Wade ruling, experts are warning that it could pave the way for increased prosecutions of those who seek abortions. Last week a Louisiana bill classifying abortion as murder was withdrawn after causing a firestorm of controversy, mainly for seeking to subject people seeking to end their own pregnancies to criminal prosecution. For years, much of the anti-abortion movement has insisted that the criminalization of abortion should target providers but exempt pregnant people. But that view stands in tension with the trajectory of the anti-abortion movement, which has successfully labored to enshrine the notion of “fetal personhood” in law and rhetoric, leading to the growing criminalization of pregnancy outcomes in recent years. The idea that human life begins at conception and must be protected by the state cannot restrict abortion so long as the protections of Roe v Wade stand. But the same idea has been planted in dozens of state criminal codes that grant zygotes, embryos and fetuses legal status as victims in other contexts. Even with Roe in place, the notion that fetuses have status separate from the people who carry them has helped fuel the criminalization of at least 1,700 people – probably a dramatic undercount, advocates say – in connection with their pregnancies, for crimes like homicide and delivering drugs to a minor. It has also paved the way for a wider dragnet should the supreme court overturn Roe, as the draft opinion leaked earlier this month signaled will happen in a matter of weeks. Most such laws exempt the pregnant person from criminal charges. But that didn’t stop the arrest of Lizelle Herrera, a Texas woman recently charged with murder for “intentionally and knowingly causing the death of an individual by self-induced abortion”. The charges were ultimately dropped, with the district attorney admitting they had no basis in law. Self-managed abortion remains legal in the vast majority of states. (South Carolina, Oklahoma and Nevada are exceptions.) Similar incidents could become more common without Roe, if 26 states ban abortion as expected. “We could see prosecutors emboldened to step beyond what the law permits,” says Farah Diaz-Tello, senior counsel and legal director of If/When/How, a reproductive justice group. Diaz-Tello’s organization operates a legal helpline to help people understand their rights if they seek to manage their own abortions. She says the helpline has seen a dramatic uptick in calls since the draft decision overturning Roe was leaked. Roe says pregnant women have the right to an abortion and that fetuses are not people entitled to the constitution’s protections. But that finding in 1973 came with a stipulation. “​​If this suggestion of personhood is established,” Justice Harry A Blackmun wrote in the decision, the “case, of course, collapses.” Over the last half-century anti-abortion activists saw Blackmun’s point as an invitation. Within a week, Representative Lawrence Hogan of Maryland introduced the human life amendment to overturn Roe and declare human life to begin at conception. It has repeatedly been introduced, and failed, since. With a national ban out of reach, an incremental, state-based approach took hold to normalize personhood. In 1989, the supreme court upheld a Missouri law that stated in its preamble that “the life of each human being begins at conception”, and “unborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and wellbeing”. While that language came into direct conflict with Roe, the court ruled the preamble could stand because it didn’t actively restrict abortion. In a scathing dissent, Blackmun gave an ominous warning: ″For today, the women of this nation still retain the liberty to control their destinies. But the signs are evident and very ominous, and a chill wind blows.” The 1989 ruling encouraged abortion opponents to seed fetal personhood as widely as possible, helping fuel the spread of criminal laws recognizing fetuses as potential victims. This idea has been particularly toxic in combination with the war on drugs that exploded in the 1980s, disproportionately targeting women of color. In her book Policing the Womb: Invisible Women and the Criminalization of Motherhood, the legal scholar Michele Goodwin calls Black women the “canaries in the coal mine” for the government’s policing of pregnancy. A study by the National Advocates for Pregnant Women (NAPW) found that 52% of cases of women targeted for pregnancy outcomes between 1973 and 2005 were Black, despite Black women making up about 14% of people of reproductive age. In 2003, Goodwin has written, Regina McKnight, a Black woman from South Carolina, became the first woman convicted for “homicide by child abuse” for a stillbirth due to drug use. Her case “inspired similar prosecutions of other poor black women and then of other women”. McKnight served seven years before her sentence was overturned. According to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, there are thousands of crimes in the federal criminal code that may be used against pregnant people when Roe falls. “We really can’t look to pre-1973 for any sort of help in understanding what we’re facing, says Dana Sussman, acting executive director of NAPW. “We’re in a completely different universe when it comes to our willingness to criminalize people.” To date, 39 states have “fetal homicide” laws. Fetal personhood also lives in the Republican party platform and in a number of state laws that have been blocked by federal courts thanks to the protections that the supreme court’s draft opinion undoes. They have been the subject of ballot initiatives in Mississippi, North Dakota and Colorado – where they failed by a wide margin, in part because of their implications for in-vitro fertilization – along with Alabama, which approved a fetal personhood amendment to its constitution in 2018. As with Lizelle Hererra, advocates have often been able to rally public outcry in support of people arrested for actions related to their pregnancies. But not every case attracts public attention. And dismissed cases do not erase the trauma and stigma of criminalization and incarceration. In 2013, for example, Purvi Patel was charged with feticide and felony child neglect in Indiana for a self-induced abortion and sentenced to 20 years. Her conviction was overturned, but not before she spent three years in prison. In Oklahoma, Brittney Poolaw is currently serving a four-year sentence for manslaughter after admitting to hospital staff when suffering a miscarriage that she had used drugs. The word “child” in several states – South Carolina, Alabama and Oklahoma – has been interpreted by prosecutors and courts to apply to fetuses throughout the criminal code. “State prosecutors throughout those states can use any law that was intended to apply to the abuse or harm of children to fertilized eggs, embryos and fetuses,” says Sussman. “In those states, we’ve already lost that argument. And we anticipate we will lose more of them without Roe and Casey.” Diaz-Tello cautions against defeatism. If pregnant people remain exempt from criminalization under existing laws and future bans, legal advocates can win challenges to prosecutions that arise. “As long as the law is not permitting people to be criminally prosecuted, we’re going to be here to hold them to it,” she says. Even if Roe is no longer the law of the land, “we still have the power to ensure that laws are not passed that criminalize people for seeking abortion care”. Whether these exemptions hold remains to be seen. But the threat of criminalization is not about to recede given a patchwork of extreme restrictions and an emboldened anti-abortion movement allying with prosecutors. “The chaos and the confusion of all this is by design,” says Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the reproductive freedom project at the American Civil Liberties Union. “When people are confused and scared, it makes it less likely that they will seek access to abortion and it increases the stigma related to abortion. And all of this falls most heavily on people who are in the most marginalized communities.”",News/Law,Who will be prosecuted for abortion if fetuses are recognized as people?,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/may/18/abortion-prosecution-fetal-homicide-law
5/18/2022,"The last Christmas Island forest skink was named Gump. She lived in a spacious cage filled with rocks, soil, logs and a ready supply of fresh invertebrate food in the island’s national park. She wasn’t particularly active, but then again it’s impossible to know what goes on in the mind of a skink. Her namesake was Forrest Gump – they were both solitary individuals who, despite being mild and unassuming, experienced momentous events while remaining quite unaware of the exceptional courses their lives had taken. The Christmas island forest skink (or whiptail skink) used to thrive on its island home, an Australian territory off the coast of Indonesia. In 1979, researchers documented that they were its most abundant skink. These lizards were, visually, fairly nondescript. Not too small, but by no means large, they averaged about 20cm (8in) in length, with a slim body covered in brown-yellow scales. They were practically the default image that comes to mind when you think “lizard”. As recently as 1998, you could see dozens upon dozens of their little tan bodies among the leaf litter of the forest floor, basking in the slivers of sunlight poking through the dense forest canopy, munching on the insects they found. What is perhaps most frustrating to those who fondly remember Gump and the other forest skinks is that they can’t say for sure what caused their rapid downfall. The forest skinks are an ancient group of species, evolving more than 5m years ago. They lived on Christmas Island for tens, if not hundreds of thousands of years. And yet they declined from abundance to extinction in mere decades. By 2003, they could only be found in select, niche locations on the island, which measures just 135 sq km (52 sq miles). It was probably a confluence of factors. About a quarter to a third of the island was cleared in the 20th century for phosphate mining, disrupting the island’s ecology in ways that are still not fully understood. Another problem was all the non-native species that were introduced to the island. Insects such as crazy ants competed with the skinks for food. Wolf snakes, feral cats and giant centipedes all preyed on the reptiles. Forest skinks, which had lived with very few natural predators on their isolated island for so long, could not withstand these pressures from all sides. By 2008, researchers could only find the forest skink at one site. The skinks’ decline was happening so quickly that biologists felt a kind of whiplash. They still knew so little about these reptiles, and yet they were already vanishing. Amid a sense of great urgency, in 2009 they sought to capture as many forest skinks as they could for a breeding program. But it was too late. There were too few of the highly evasive, shy creatures. In the end, they caught just three, all female, including Gump. The trio lived in a cage for a couple of years, until two of them, in an unfortunate mishap, escaped from their cage and died. Just Gump remained. Conservation scientists hoped that they would find a male for Gump to mate with to keep the species alive. But though they scoured the rugged terrain of Christmas Island, examining limestone boulders and combing through the forest, no forest skink had been seen in the wilderness since 2010, at the end of those initial capture efforts. Gump lived for another few lonely, quiet years. Looking at Gump and her solitary existence “gives you a really odd feeling”, says John Woinarski, a conservation biologist at Australia’s Charles Darwin University who lived on Christmas Island for two years to study endangered species such as the skinks. “You’re looking at that last individual, knowing that when the individual will die, as it inevitably would, that it would be the end of that long evolutionary history … It’s a scar on our conscience.” Gump succumbed in May 2014, just four months after Australian legislation finally listed the Christmas Island forest skink as endangered. The International Union for Conservation of Nature declared the species officially extinct in 2017. Even if they hadn’t dwindled so quickly, Gump and her kindred forest skinks would have been conservation underdogs.

5/18/2022,"Matthew Mott has won the race to be appointed coach of the England men’s white-ball team, ending seven years in charge of the Australian women’s side by signing a four-year contract to lead the reigning ODI world champions, with his immediate focus being a return to his native country for this autumn’s Twenty20 World Cup. Under his stewardship Australia’s women won consecutive T20 World Cups and one 50-over World Cup, went four Ashes series undefeated and triumphed in 26 successive one-day internationals, a record unmatched in either the men’s or women’s game. He had previously coached New South Wales and Glamorgan, and briefly worked with England’s new red-ball coach, Brendon McCullum, at the Indian Premier League team Kolkata Knight Riders. In accepting the role, Mott underlined the “deep connections” he has with the UK, where he had “spent considerable time both as a player and coach” and where some of his closest friends live. “It was always going to take something special to leave the role that I have loved for the past seven years with the Australian Women’s team,” the 48-year-old said. “However, I genuinely believe that the time is right to play a role in helping the England Men’s ODI and T20 group continue to evolve as one of the best teams in the world.” After his appointment last week McCullum said he had not been interested in the white-ball role because the team, currently ranked second in both 20- and 50-over formats, has been too successful since Eoin Morgan’s appointment as captain in 2015. “The white ball didn’t interest me because the team is flying, they’re one of the best teams in the world,” he said. “I wasn’t really interested in a cushy kind of gig.” But Morgan will be almost 40 by the end of Mott’s contract and Rob Key, the managing director of England’s men’s cricket, said that the Australian would “be able to oversee any transition that the team will go through in the future”. “I am fully aware that this team has been functioning well,” Mott said, “and part of my initial plan is to work with the playing group and support staff on how we can firstly maintain, then enhance, the success they have started to build over the past few years.” The appointment, with Mott unanimously favoured by a selection panel of Key, the ECB’s outgoing CEO Tom Harrison, the strategic advisor, Andrew Strauss, and performance director Mo Bobat, means that both England’s red- and white-ball squads are to be led by foreign coaches. Key said that part of Mott’s remit will be to “help us invest in English coaches, getting them as much experience as possible over the next few years”. “Matt has had an incredible coaching journey with so many varied experiences that have brought him to this point, where he was outstanding in the interview process and the perfect fit for our white-ball teams,” Key said. “We are lucky to be able to appoint a Head Coach that has not only been involved in international cricket for the last few years but he has also worked in franchise cricket around the world. More importantly, what he has done with the Australian Women’s team is what will be asked of him to achieve for our men’s white-ball sides.",Sport/Sport,Matthew Mott confirmed as England men’s new white-ball cricket coach,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/18/matthew-mott-confirmed-as-england-mens-new-white-ball-cricket-coach
5/18/2022,"The world is at “boiling point” and humanity needs to redefine its relationship with nature if it is to address a web of crises, from rising prices to extreme heat and floods, according to a report released ahead of a landmark UN conference. The research from the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and the Council on Energy Environment and Water says the solutions to the interlinked planetary and inequality crisis exist, but calls for “bold science-based decision-making” to “completely rethink our way of living,”. “In many ways, the world is at boiling point – with extreme temperatures in south Asia, escalating fuel and food prices, and war and conflict,” said Åsa Persson, research director at SEI. “In our report, we seek to connect the big picture of intertwined planetary and inequality crises with the promising momentum for change that we see in public awareness and key technologies, to shift from urgency to agency” The report is published ahead of a UN meeting, Stockholm 50, which marks 50 years since the pivotal environment gathering in the Swedish capital in 1972. It argues that although all the ingredients for change exist – from growing public support for structural change to accelerating clean technology – there has been a stark lack of action. It says transformative change can happen by making sustainable lifestyles the easy and preferred choice for people and communities and by promoting business models that focus on services delivered, not products made. “The ample opportunities for policymakers to take action and the growing momentum for change gives me hope,” said Nina Weitz, from SEI. “We see how public opinion reflects the urgency and willingness to change lifestyles, how youth worldwide demand and exercise more agency to fight climate change, environmental degradation and inequity and that technological development and uptake is occurring faster than anticipated.” The report’s recommendations include: Replacing GDP as the single metric to measure progress and instead focus on indicators that take “inclusive wealth” and the caring economy into account. Establishing a regular UN forum on sustainable lifestyles. A global campaign on nature-based education for children. Transforming people’s everyday relationship with nature by integrating it in cities; protecting animal welfare and shifting to more plant-based diets. It also says policymakers should draw on indigenous local knowledge. The report calls for improved co-ordination between states to tackle ecological and other crisis and stronger accountability for those failing to act. “Countries, companies and citizens have to be held accountable for their actions and their inaction,” it states. “We need new imaginative mechanisms for nurturing constructive accountability, which incentivises and leads to bold action and change.” The 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment established a framework for action and set a global agenda for humans and the environment, with heads of state committing to protect and promote human and environmental health and well-being. Organisers say next month’s Stockholm 50 conference aims to act as a springboard for the UN’s “decade of action” and help deliver on pledges made on climate change, biodiversity and the adoption of green post-Covid-19 recovery plans.",News/Environment,"‘World is at boiling point’: humanity must redefine relationship with nature, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/18/humanity-nature-stockholm-environment-institute-report
5/18/2022,"Anthony Albanese has flagged a new national strategy to minimise Covid-related deaths if he wins Saturday’s election, and says looming opposition election costings will book a $750m saving from paring back grants programs. The Labor leader’s signal of a public health reboot during an appearance at the National Press Club on Wednesday followed Scott Morrison declaring earlier in the day the country needed to move on from the pandemic despite Australia recording 5,633 deaths this year and battling the highest Covid transmission rates per capita in the world. As the leaders sharpened their final campaign pitches to undecided voters, new wages data also confirmed that incomes in Australia aren’t keeping pace with surging inflation – a development reinforcing Albanese’s argument that low paid workers need a pay boost. The latest batch of opinion polls point to a tightening of the political contest in the final week. Morrison hit the hustings in Victoria before ending the day in the marginal Tasmanian seat of Braddon, while Albanese fronted the National Press Club in Canberra. Asked what he would do to reduce the number of Covid deaths if he won the election on Saturday, the Labor leader said there was a need to “step up the national strategy”. He said he had requested officials provide a comprehensive briefing on a national plan next week in the event he was sworn in as prime minister. Albanese said the pandemic continued to be a “major issue” in the community and he wanted advice about how to refresh the approach, including “how do we get the information out there so people get their booster shots – what can we do to minimise the impact of Covid, which is continuing to have an ongoing impact on people?” Earlier in the day, the prime minister had told journalists: “We are living with Covid, and not going back to those daily press conferences of people talking about Covid every day, and putting the threat of shutdowns and lockdowns and interfering in people’s lives again”. During a speech in Melbourne later in the day Morrison declared the pandemic had revealed a lot about the power of government to Australians “and I think we’re over that, and we want to put that in the rear-vision mirror”. Morrison has been keen to keep the focus on economic management, but faced questions on Wednesday about the latest wage price index figures that showed real wages are falling behind. Wages rose 2.4% in the past year, and 0.7% in the March quarter, but remained well behind inflation which reached 5.1%. The prime minister said that wages would continue to rise as unemployment came down, but said it would take longer for wages to keep up with inflation if Labor was elected. “I’ve been very candid with Australians about the economic challenges that we’re facing and you’re right to highlight the challenges that are there with real wages. Labor has no magic bullet on this. They have no magic pen or magic wand.” “I’m saying wages are rising and will rise. The challenge is inflation, and that’s a global challenge,” he said. Albanese has faced pressure on the hustings for leaving the release of Labor’s official campaign costings to the final days of the contest. The Labor leader said on Wednesday the costings to be released in Canberra on Thursday would include a reduction in uncommitted funding in the Community Development Grants Program by $350m. He said Labor would also return a $400m regionalisation fund to the budget bottomline. Albanese noted those decisions would repair the budget by “three quarters of a billion dollars”. That news sent the deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce on the political attack. “This is why Labor can’t win a seat in regional Australia, why their seats are at threat in regional Australia,” Joyce said on Wednesday afternoon. “The regionalisation fund is so that regional communities can pick the industry that takes them ahead, whether that’s tourism, whether that’s manufacturing, to get better paying jobs into regional Australia.” Labor has been signalling its campaign costings will show a less favourable budget bottomline than the Coalition’s. But Albanese went on the offensive about the Morrison government’s plan to imposed a higher efficiency dividend across the public sector to deliver $3.3bn in savings to fund the Coalition’s election promises. A fired up Labor leader declared: “You know what that leads to – robodebt”. “It doesn’t save money. It costs money, because you take humans out of human services, and it has devastating consequences for real people. It costs lives. Lives! As well as over $1 billion to taxpayers.”",News/Australia news,Labor to consider new national Covid strategy to reduce deaths,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/labor-to-consider-new-national-covid-strategy-to-reduce-deaths
5/18/2022,"England’s red-ball new dawn has seen two uncapped 23-year-olds get their first chance of international glory and second chances handed to the country’s two most experienced bowlers of all time, as the team seeks to improve their recently moribund fortunes under the stewardship of Brendon McCullum. As widely trailed by the side’s new captain, Ben Stokes, the 13-man squad for the first two Tests of a three-match series against McCullum’s compatriots from New Zealand, at Lord’s and Trent Bridge next month, features both James Anderson and Stuart Broad, first and third respectively on England’s all-time most-capped list. They return to the fold after being left out of the squad that toured West Indies in March, while England have a lengthy list of injury-enforced absentees among the bowlers, with the recently food-poisoned Ollie Robinson not considered fit for selection. Yorkshire’s Harry Brook, who with 758 runs across eight County Championship innings at an average of 151.6 has been the outstanding domestic batter of the English summer so far, gets his first Test call-up – he made his T20 debut in January – alongside Durham’s Matthew Potts, whose current haul of 35 wickets is 11 more than any other bowler in either division. Rob Key, the managing director of England men’s cricket, said the pair had been “rewarded for outstanding starts to the County season and deserve an opportunity to stake a claim at this level”. Most recently Potts took 11 wickets as Durham beat Glamorgan last week, posting career-best figures of seven for 40 in the second innings. “I tend not to try and read them too much,” he said after that game of reports suggesting he was in line for a Test call-up. “It would be a dream to be picked and obviously to play Test cricket is something I aspire to do.” New Zealand won the inaugural World Test Championship last year, when they also at times outclassed England in winning a two-match Test series, and currently sit third in the Test rankings, well ahead of the sixth-placed English side, but Key said he expected this year’s meetings to be closely contested. “This is the start of a new era for our Test team under the stewardship of Ben and Brendon,” he said. “With a blend of youth and experience, we have selected an exciting squad that can compete with New Zealand. It promises to be a mouthwatering series, and I can’t wait for the team to start against a very good New Zealand side. It is a fascinating prospect for everyone connected with the sport in this country.” The squad was selected by a six-man panel comprised of Key, McCullum and Stokes as well as the ECB’s performance director, Mo Bobat, the head scout, James Taylor, and the player identification lead, David Court. England Test squad: Ben Stokes (Durham, captain), James Anderson (Lancashire), Jonathan Bairstow (Yorkshire), Stuart Broad (Nottinghamshire), Harry Brook (Yorkshire), Zak Crawley (Kent), Ben Foakes (Surrey), Jack Leach (Somerset), Alex Lees (Durham), Craig Overton (Somerset), Matthew Potts (Durham), Ollie Pope (Surrey), Joe Root (Yorkshire).",Sport/Sport,England usher in new Test era with calls for Harry Brook and Matthew Potts,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/18/england-usher-in-new-test-era-with-calls-for-harry-brook-and-matthew-potts
