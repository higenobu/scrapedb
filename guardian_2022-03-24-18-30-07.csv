3/24/2022,"The boss of Next has called on the government to make it easier for workers to come to the UK, as the retailer said staff shortages, as well as disruption from the war in Ukraine, would fuel an 8% rise in its prices this autumn. Next said its homeware prices were now expected to rise by up to 13% and fashion by 6.5% in the second half of this year, a significant step up from an overall 3.7% increase in prices in the first part of the year. Simon Wolfson, its chief executive and a prominent pro-Brexit business voice, called on the government to “reverse the self-defeating barriers it has placed on overseas workers supporting our economy and accelerate, simplify and reform the planning process to increase the supply of desperately needed housing”. He argued that inflation was being fuelled by “chronic labour shortages” alongside disruption in global supply chains. The call came as Next downgraded profit hopes for the year as it revealed it would take an £85m hit from the closure of websites in Ukraine and Russia. However, the company said better than expected sales in the UK meant it was downgrading profit expectations for the year ahead by just £18m to £850m, which would be 3% ahead of those for the year to January 2022. Wolfson said a return to more formal dressing was fuelling better than expected sales in the UK in the first few months of 2022, while there had been a “notable reduction” in spending on homewares and very casual clothing in a reversal of lockdown trends. He said the outlook was hard to predict amid further disruption in supply chains and competition for shoppers’ cash from inflation on essentials, likely mortgage rate increases and a return to spending on leisure and travel. The adjustment to its profit outlook came as Next said it had increased sales by 11.5% on pre-pandemic levels to £4.9bn in the year to January as a 45% rise in online sales offset a 23% fall of full price sales on the high street. Pretax profits rose 10% to £823m. Next predicted it could close more than 140 stores over the next 15 years as it adjusted to changing shopping habits. The retailer currently has 477 main stores after closing 14 over the past year and expects to close 15 in the year ahead. Wolfson said last year had “exceeded all our expectations”. Online sales of homeware and children’s clothing made up for much of the lost retail sales in the first quarter of the year when high streets were in lockdown. Then, in the autumn and winter, the websites were able to meet “pent-up demand” for adult clothing, which Wolfson said was “fuelled by the release of consumer savings accumulated in lockdown”. Next said for the year ahead it would be broadening the products it sold further by moving into new categories such as men’s and women’s performance sportswear and licensing out its brand name for specialist products such as paint and wallpaper. It has taken on the licence to sell the US brand Bath & Body Works in the UK, with plans to open concessions in Next stores and has also developed new in-house brands including WOAH vegan skincare and Own Denim affordable denim. The company will also use its sourcing and design expertise to create products such as children’s clothing for other brands.",News/Business,Next says prices to rise by 8% in autumn amid ‘chronic’ staff shortages,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/24/next-says-prices-to-rise-by-8-in-autumn-amid-chronic-staff-shortages
3/24/2022,"The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) has said it will prosecute Transport for London and the driver who crashed a tram in Croydon in 2016 for alleged health and safety failings. A jury verdict in an inquest in July determined that the crash was accidental, which was met with fury from the victims’ families. The tragedy is considered the worst to have occurred on a British tramway for more than 90 years. The ORR said it had “made a fair, independent and objective assessment about what happened” and that the prosecution would enable a court to consider whether health and safety laws were breached. The inquest jury determined that the tram driver, Alfred Dorris, “became disoriented, which caused loss of awareness in his surroundings, probably due to a microsleep.” He failed to brake in time and drove his tram “towards a tight curve at excessive speed”. They said the tram operator, Tram Operations Ltd (TOL), had failed to adequately account for the risk of a high-speed derailment or ensure a “just culture” where drivers felt able to report health and safety concerns. The seven passengers who died – Dane Chinnery, 19, Donald Collett, 62, Robert Huxley, 63, Philip Logan, 52, Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35, Philip Seary, 57, and Mark Smith, 35 – sustained head, chest and other injuries after being ejected from the tram in the crash on 9 November 2016. A hearing will take place at Croydon magistrates court on a date be set imminently.The ORR’s chief inspector of railways, Ian Prosser, said: “My thoughts are with the families of the seven people who lost their lives on November 9 2016, the many more injured and everyone whose lives have been impacted as a result of this incident.“Following a detailed and thorough investigation, we’ve taken the decision to prosecute Transport for London, Tram Operations Limited and driver Alfred Dorris for what we believe to be health and safety failings.” FirstGroup, which owns TOL, said that since the crash it had introduced safety measures including improved speed monitoring, in-cab safety devices, better rosters and more training on the risk of fatigue.",News/UK news,Driver and TfL face prosecution over Croydon tram crash,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/24/driver-and-tfl-face-prosecution-over-croydon-tram-crash
3/24/2022,"Far: Changing Tides melds Mario with Cormac McCarthy and a touch of nautical engineering. Human civilisation lies in ruins, and you are a child journeying to the other end of it. You can’t do this on foot, however. As in Okomotive’s previous Far: Lone Sails, the star is actually your vehicle – a rattling origami hybrid of sailboat and first world war tank. Scurry inside, and the hull lifts away dollhouse-style to reveal a warren of buttons and boilers. This isn’t the fantasy of uninhibited traversal offered by car-based apocalypses such as Mad Max: you don’t so much drive the craft as maintain it while it plots its own course rightward through flooded cities and glacial seas. Changing Tides is a game of three moods. First, the satisfying rhythms of ship management – stowing fuel and pumping the bellows while hosing down the overheating engine, or angling pop-out sails to catch the wind. Second, the mild thrill of exploration outside, whether scouting for fuel or to clear the path by, say, operating a crane. And third, the reflective interludes when things are humming along nicely and you have a moment to watch the horizons pass. This is an artfully disguised concept album: your progress is delicately synched to the score, with certain melodies triggered through sheer momentum or reaching the critical point in a puzzle. The ship itself plays a role in some puzzles, slotted into mechanisms like a skeleton key. It’s often augmented in the process – one bolt-on even lets you delve beneath the waves. Changing Tides is more waterborne remake of its predecessor Lone Sails than a sequel. In some regards, it’s the inferior game. The backdrops remain mesmerising but the soundtrack isn’t as inspired, and there are clumsy touches such as buoys that must be rammed aside. The grander supporting narrative suggested by certain wall murals also feels like an unwelcome Marvelisation of a setting that works better as a collection of symbols for ecological catastrophe. It’s a landscape worth visiting, nonetheless. Okomotive’s games are the antithesis of open world blockbusters – see that mountain? You can’t go there – and their geography is all the more sublime for being non-traversable. Rather than routine video game empowerment, Changing Tides offers mindful deprivation in a ravaged world where even the concept of a haven must move with the flow.

3/24/2022,"A quiet change to how the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publicly reports Covid death details underscores the need for the agency to communicate clearly and transparently about rapidly evolving science, experts say. The past two years have created numerous communication challenges for the agency, which works with massive amounts of data from scores of different sources, including states and territories. “Mistakes are inevitable because humans are fallible, but there should always be an effort promptly to explain what happened and what’s being done to prevent it from happening again,” said Tom Frieden, a former CDC director and the president and CEO of Results Save Lives. “You have to over-communicate, basically,” he said. “Any time there is something that needs to be corrected, be upfront about it: here’s what happened, here’s what we know, here’s what we don’t know.” Last week, after reporting from the Guardian on mortality rates among children, the CDC corrected a “coding logic error” that had inadvertently added more than 72,000 Covid deaths of all ages to the data tracker, one of the most publicly accessible sources for Covid data. The agency briefly noted the change in a footnote, although the note did not explain how the error occurred or how long it was in effect. A total of 72,277 deaths in all age groups reported across 26 states were removed from the tracker “because CDC’s algorithm was accidentally counting deaths that were not Covid-19-related”, Jasmine Reed, a spokesperson for the agency, told the Guardian. The problem stemmed from two questions the CDC asks of states and jurisdictions when they report fatalities, according to a source familiar with the issue. One data field asks if a person died “from illness/complications of illness,” and the field next to this asks for the date of death. When the answer is yes, then the date of death should be provided. But a problem apparently arose if a respondent included the date of death in this field even when the answer was “no” or “unknown”. The CDC’s system assumed that if a date was provided, then the “no” or “unknown” answer was an error, and the system switched the answer to “yes”. This resulted in an overcount of deaths due to Covid in the demographic breakdown, and the error, once discovered, was corrected last week. The CDC did not answer a question on how long the coding error was in effect. “Working with near real-time data in an emergency is critical to guide decision-making, but may also mean we often have incomplete information when data are first reported,” said Reed. The death counts in the data tracker are “real-time and subject to change”, Reed noted, while numbers from the National Center for Health Statistics, a center within the CDC, are “the most complete source of death data”, despite lags in reporting, because the process includes a review of death certificates. Reporting on causes of death is difficult even in non-pandemic times, experts said. “It’s really hard to get accurate numbers,” said Glen Nowak, a former director of media relations at the CDC and co-director of the Center for Health & Risk Communication at the University of Georgia’s Grady College. “It’s not just with Covid – it happens with pretty much any infectious disease or even foodborne illnesses and waterborne illnesses, where there’s a large outbreak.” There are a few reasons for that. Healthcare providers usually report the initial data, but treating patients is a more pressing priority. Death certificates take time to complete, and the cause of death may be subject to political pressure or difficulty determining the underlying reason or reasons. States and other jurisdictions may have lags in sending the data to the CDC; currently, one-third of deaths are reported after 10 days. Then the CDC processes the data, which can also be an involved process. Most CDC data comes from state and local governments, and the quality can vary widely “because there has been a decades-long under-investment in public health at the national, state, city and local levels,” Frieden said. “The public health and healthcare system we have in this country makes it extraordinarily difficult to collect data well.” The CDC estimates that more than 968,000 Americans have died of Covid, and this change does not seem to have affected that estimate. The tracker shows demographic data on about 785,000 deaths, which means there may be more than 180,000 deaths not yet tallied in these breakdowns. The recent change to demographic data shows the difficulty of offering up-to-date assessments while data reporting and analysis have lagged in the face of a massive outbreak. Data on the same topic across the CDC can also vary depending on the source and how numbers were calculated. “The level of precision that you see in these numbers makes you think that they must be really super accurate,” Nowak said. Instead, they are informed estimates that help contextualize the scope of Covid compared with other illnesses. “I don’t think public health and others do a good-enough job of reminding people that these numbers have significant margins of errors,” Nowak said. “The caveats need to be clear that these are our best estimates based on the data that has been reported to CDC.” As the scientific evidence accumulates, adjustments and changes are inevitable and frequent. But significant changes in calculations and records need to be explained clearly, particularly in an emergency where the public is frequently attuned to data – and to unexplained changes – like this. “The best practice, really, is to have virtually daily briefings, so that you’re updating daily about what you’re seeing and you’re answering questions daily,” Frieden said. That’s how the agency addressed past outbreaks of Ebola, Zika and H1N1, also known as swine flu. These briefings should be held by the scientists with expertise in many areas, not just the director of the CDC, he said. The current CDC administration has “gradually been getting back in the habit of doing that, and I hope that trend will continue”. The CDC is a government agency that provides data to inform national policy, and public health policies often have some political component, Frieden said. It can never be apolitical. “But you should never have any concerns about the accuracy of the data.”",News/World news,"CDC coding error led to overcount of 72,000 Covid deaths",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/cdc-coding-error-overcount-covid-deaths
3/24/2022,"Scientists are celebrating 212 “new” freshwater fish species, including a blind eel found in the grounds of a school for blind children and a fish named Wolverine that is armed with a hidden weapons system. The New Species 2021 report, released by the conservation organisation Shoal, shows just how diverse and remarkable the world’s often undervalued freshwater species are, and suggests there is plenty more life still to be discovered in the world’s lakes, rivers and wetlands. “It’s fascinating that over 200 new freshwater fish species can be described in just a single year,” said Harmony Patricio, Shoal’s conservation programme manager. “You might see this level of new discovery for organisms like plants or insects, but not really for vertebrates. “It means there are still hundreds and hundreds more freshwater fish out there in the world that scientists don’t know about yet,” she said. “Also, many of the newly described species have pretty unique and unexpected traits.” One of those unexpected physical traits is the hidden weapons system of the Wolverine pleco (Hopliancistrus wolverine), which earned it an X-Men-inspired name. “This species has strong lateral curved spikes called odontodes tucked under the gill covers that can be extended to jab anything that tries to mess with them,” Patricio said. “Other related species in the same family, even those with big spines, aren’t known to demonstrate such behaviour. The researchers who described this species ended up with quite a few finger injuries while collecting specimens from the wild.” An average of four freshwater fish species a week were newly described last year. Other findings include the bright red Mumbai blind eel (Rakthamichthys mumba), which has no fins, scales or eyes, and was found at the bottom of a well in the grounds of a school for blind children; the tiny, translucent Danionella cerebrum, discovered in southern Myanmar and only slightly larger than a thumbnail; and the colourful Kijimuna and Bunagaya gobies (Lentipes kijimuna and Lentipes bunagaya) in southern Japan, named after woodland spirits in Okinawan folklore. Each of the 212 discoveries offers new possibilities for scientists to increase their understanding of freshwater species, including their anatomy, evolution and the connections between other creatures and their habitats. The male Danionella cerebrum, for example, has got researchers curious about its ability to make a drumming sound, most likely by tapping a thin strip of cartilage on its swim bladder, like a drumstick – a relatively complex and unusual form of communication for such a tiny creature. The same species has no roof to its skull – its brain cavity is covered only by a thin layer of skin – making it possible for scientists to study brain activity twinned with function without harming the fish. There are at least 18,267 species of freshwater fish, according to the standard reference book, Eschmeyer’s Catalog of Fishes. But the overall freshwater picture is concerning. According to the World’s Forgotten Fishes report, which Shoal, WWF and other partners published in 2021, more than a third of freshwater fish species are threatened with extinction, despite their importance to biodiversity and as a food source to billions of people. “We know that 80 species of freshwater fish have gone extinct in modern times, while there are usually around 150-200 or more new species discovered in an average year,” said Patricio. “But population levels of many freshwater fish have declined massively over the past 50-plus years. “There’s a whole suite of factors that has led to their decline, but the primary causes are impacts from invasive species, pollution, overfishing and habitat loss and degradation.” More work is needed to protect lakes, rivers and other freshwater sources, and their inhabitants, including other numerous “new” species waiting to be discovered. Shoal hopes its inaugural new species report will raise awareness “about the freshwater biodiversity crisis we’re facing”, said Patricio, “so people realise freshwater fish are disappearing at twice the rate of marine or terrestrial species. “Hopefully,” she said, “they’ll be motivated to support conservation efforts and encourage their governments to do more.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Wolverine fish and blind eel among 212 new freshwater species,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/wolverine-fish-with-secret-spikes-is-one-of-212-new-freshwater-species-found-aoe
3/24/2022,"Jacqui Lambie has alleged that Scott Morrison told her she risked jail time if she disclosed details of a secret deal that required the government to allow refugees to resettle in New Zealand in exchange for her support to repeal Australia’s “medevac” laws. The Tasmanian independent senator made the accusations about the “quite threatening” exchange in an interview with news.com.au, published hours after the Morrison government announced it would finally take up New Zealand’s long-standing offer to resettle 150 refugees a year. She said she was “rapt these people are free”. A law making it easier for refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island to be transferred to Australia for medical treatment was passed against the government’s will in the last sitting week of 2018. But this medevac legislation was scrapped in 2019 after Lambie joined One Nation senators and sided with the government in the upper house to have it repealed. Thursday’s news.com.au report indicated the agreement with Lambie included a private commitment from the prime minister to accept the New Zealand resettlement offer, which was first made in 2013. Lambie said there “certainly” was a written agreement and it was kept in the prime minister’s “secret safe”. “That was because he wouldn’t give it to me, so I couldn’t present anything if I came out and spoke about it – which I couldn’t anyway, because, basically, if I’d spoken about it nobody was getting off the islands,” she told news.com.au. In audio of the interview also posted online, the journalist, Samantha Maiden, asked Lambie whether she was threatened with any consequences if she spoke out about the deal. Lambie said: “Yeah … well if I had just come out and spoken about it, I may have ended up in jail, basically.” Pressed on who had told her that, Lambie said: “That was made to me over the table from the PM.” Maiden asked: “So you’re saying that the prime minister told you that you would be – you would risk jail if you told the truth?” Lambie replied: “That’s correct.” The independent senator added: “I felt really annoyed about that. I found that quite threatening.” Lambie said Morrison should now release the document about the deal and “produce it without any redactions out of it”. Lambie was unavailable for a further interview on Thursday evening, but later tweeted that she “didn’t care about the prison threat” but “I was told talking about the deal would kill the deal”. The prime minister’s office refused to comment on Lambie’s claims on Thursday, but government sources said it was not correct that she had been threatened with jail and dismissed suggestions an agreement was kept in a safe in Parliament House. However, they noted that it was standard practice that people who attended high-level security briefings were reminded of the confidentiality provisions relating to such discussions. Lambie’s revelation of what she claimed was a key element of the “secret deal” struck over the medevac legislation was floated at the time of negotiations between her and Morrison in 2019. At the time, a tearful Lambie said she had made the “really hard decision” to support the legislation’s repeal because the government had agreed to an “outcome” that would improve the treatment of refugees in Australia’s care. “I can’t let the boats start back up and I can’t let refugees die, whether it’s sinking into the ocean or waiting for a doctor, and I am voting to make sure that neither of these things happen,” Lambie said then. “We’ve worked to an outcome I believe we both want, which is an outcome that our borders are secure, the boats have stopped and sick people aren’t dying waiting for treatment. And as a result of that work … I am more than satisfied that the conditions are now in place to allow medevac to be repealed.” She said she was not being “coy or silly” by not revealing details of the proposal, saying it was a national security concern. A story published in the Sydney Morning Herald suggested that Lambie had demanded the government accept the New Zealand government’s offer – speculation Lambie never denied. “I know that’s frustrating to people, and I get that. I don’t like holding things back like this. But when I say I can’t discuss it publicly due to national security concerns, I am being 100% honest to you.” At the time, government sources insisted no deal had been done, saying Lambie had been given thorough, classified briefings about the government’s current approach to resettlement and it was on this basis that she had agreed to repeal the law. The then government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, said in 2019: “The Labor party thinks that anything, whenever we are able to persuade anyone, the Labor party just assumes there must be some secret deal – there is no secret deal.” The Australian and New Zealand governments announced on Thursday that up to 450 refugees would be resettled over the next three years, prompting widespread criticism of the Coalition for failing to take up the option sooner. The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, defended the delay by saying the government had previously prioritised the resettlement deal with the US. That deal was now “drawing to a conclusion” with only “a couple of hundred” places left.",News/Australia news,Jacqui Lambie claims Scott Morrison threatened her with jail time if she revealed secret deal on refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/24/jacqui-lambie-claims-scott-morrison-threatened-her-with-jail-time-if-she-revealed-secret-deal-on-refugees
3/24/2022,"Ada Hegerberg has announced that she will return to play for Norway at the Euros this summer after a close to five-year absence from the national team. The Women’s Champions League record goalscorer and first female winner of the Ballon d’Or, in 2018, stepped back from international football after the last European Championship in 2017, where the 2013 runners-up crashed out with three defeats in three games and failed to score. Hegerberg had been named Uefa’s Best Women’s Player in 2016 and BBC Women’s Footballer of the Year in 2017, and her decision to make herself unavailable for international football created shockwaves. She had become frustrated at what she perceived as a lack of support for the women’s team and for the development of girls’ football in Norway. Speaking to the Guardian in November 2020 she said it was a decision she had carefully considered and was triggered by a number of issues including unequal opportunities for girls and boys to play football, women and girls being forced to wait to use pitches, boots arriving for a tournament late and in the wrong sizes, and a boys’ team playing on the best pitch while the women’s team that had qualified for a World Cup had to train on an inferior pitch. “I’ve just tried to have an impact on things for the better,” she said. “At some point that can leave you with some tough choices. I’m not here to provoke in any way. I’m just here to perform and drive the sport in the right direction. But at the same time, I am realistic about the situation we find ourselves still in, that there’s so much stuff to do in order for women and young girls to get the conditions they deserve.” Hegerberg missed the World Cup in 2019 where Norway lost in the quarter-finals to England. She will report early next month for the World Cup qualifiers against Kosovo and Poland. The 26-year-old said on Thursday: “I love football, and I want to play football. I took a decision in 2017 that I stood by. But I had lot of time to reflect over the past two years, on many aspects. I was able to have very honest discussions with the federation, through Lise [Klaveness, its president] at first. I am very glad to be able to come back with the team and get a new story started.” The Norway Women manager, Martin Sjøgren, said it had been “a challenging situation” to get Hegerberg back into the national team but that he was pleased with the outcome. Hegerberg said: “I want to do my part so that we reach our goals, and inspire both young girls and boys across the country. Now I can finally do it with the flag on my chest again.” Sign up to our new women’s football newsletter Klaveness warmly welcomed the move and said: “It has not been a good feeling to have one of our best players outside the national team.” Hegerberg has continued to shine for Lyon, her club since 2014, being named BBC Women’s Football of the Year again in 2019 and runner up for Uefa’s Best Women’s Player in 2018 and 2019. The five-times Champions League winner holds the record for the most goals scored in a Champions League season: 15.

3/24/2022,"England took a step closer to a World Cup semi-final berth with a comprehensive victory against Pakistan, bowling them out for 105 in 41.3 overs before a welcome return to form for Danni Wyatt (76 not out from 68 balls) saw the defending champions chase down the runs with nine wickets and 184 balls to spare – giving a healthy boost to their net run rate in the process. Katherine Brunt, who before this match had taken only one wicket in the tournament, responded to her critics with a return of 3 for 17, before Sophie Ecclestone (3 for 18) wrapped up the tail. Brunt said that she was happy to have finally made a contribution to the team, after a lean run of form with the ball. “We’ve been on tour a long time, 11 weeks away from home. When you’re having to turn up every day and put on a brave face, it’s difficult,” she said. “I’m a really competitive person, and I want so badly to contribute every game, in any way. I always want to be involved, so when you’re not, it genuinely feels rubbish.” “That [first] wicket brought a lot of feelings out of me – I felt a lot of relief,” she added. “We will definitely take a lot of confidence from this and we will keep trying to gain momentum.” England also pulled off two smart run-outs, as Pakistan were reduced to 59 for 5 in the first 25 overs of their innings and failed to claw it back. England had won the toss and opted to bowl first, but struggled early on in their chase due to a hooping opening spell from Diana Baig. Tammy Beaumont was struck in front playing across the line in the fifth over, and Pakistan correctly opted to review the on-field not-out decision. Baig then consistently beat the bat of Heather Knight (24 not out), who hung around but left most of the scoring shots to Wyatt. Wyatt was handed a reprieve with only four runs to her name, put down by Nida Dar at gully, and rubbed salt into the wound by sending the next three balls flying over the boundary rope. She snuck an edge past a diving Sidra Nawaz behind the stumps on 31, but was otherwise convincing, pulling hard through midwicket en route to her maiden half-century in World Cups. By the end she had banished the ghosts of England’s nervy run-chase against New Zealand on Sunday, lofting fours over mid-off with ease to hand England victory inside 20 overs. Pakistan had come into the match buoyed by their eight-wicket win against West Indies on Monday, breaking an 18-match losing streak that extended back to 2009, but this loss sealed their exit from the tournament. For England, a win in their final group-stage match against Bangladesh on Sunday will guarantee qualification for the semi-finals. On Thursday, South Africa, became the first nation from England’s group to secure a semi-final berth after their match against West Indies was abandoned. Brunt has struggled in this tournament to find a consistent line and length, but – after working hard in the nets on Wednesday to correct a technical fault in her action – something finally clicked against Pakistan. Her first ball of the day was a beauty of an outswinger that found the edge of Nahida Khan and was snaffled by Heather Knight at slip, leaving Pakistan 0 for 1 in the blink of an eye. A second spell then yielded wickets in successive overs – Nida Dar trapped lbw, before Brunt nipped one back off the seam and bowled the top-scorer, Sidra Ameen (32 off 77). England veered between the sublime and the ridiculous in the field. Sophia Dunkley (at cover) and Ecclestone (at mid-off) were left staring blankly at each other in the 13th over after a leading edge from Omaima Sohail fell safely between the two of them – each expecting the other to go for the catch. Fortunately for England, Beaumont made up for the error in the very next over, running Sohail out with a direct hit from mid-off. Dunkley had herself earlier played a key role in the run-out of the Pakistan captain, Bismah Maroof, intercepting a throw-in from Amy Jones in front of the stumps after Maroof called for a nonexistent second run. Knight, though, labelled it England’s “most complete performance” of the World Cup. The surprise omission of the off-spinner Charlie Dean from the XI meant that Knight instead brought herself into the attack in the 33rd over for a three-over cameo, which paid dividends when she claimed the scalp of Aliya Riaz with her second ball, caught top-edging a sweep to short fine leg. Kate Cross lived up to her “Mrs Consistent” epithet, rattling the stumps of Sidra Nawaz (23 off 44) in the 39th after sending down 35 dot balls, conceding only 19 runs from her eight overs. At the other end, Ecclestone’s inroads offered no respite. After forcing edges behind the stumps from Fatima Sana and Aiman Anwer, the left-armer finished things in style with a yorker to bowl Baig. England may have done some hard yards this tournament but on Thursday they made it look very easy indeed.

3/24/2022,"The New York Times reports on a nostalgic surge for landline phones in the US. In parallel with the resurgent affection for VHS tapes and record players, young people are apparently drawn to old-fashioned corded, non-digital instruments as an antidote to screen fatigue and bottomless distraction. They like the idea of a tool that only does one thing: makes phone calls. To the British this may sound like missing something that never quite went away. Although landlines are in sharp decline in the UK, four in five households still have one, even if a quarter of us don’t have a phone plugged into it. Mine was installed only five years ago, as an inescapable element of a new broadband/TV package. I have never used it; I’m not even sure what my phone number is. I don’t miss the landline, because I remember that by the end it served exclusively as a conduit for nuisance calls. I stopped answering it, and then I unplugged it so it would stop ringing. If I wanted to, I could have it back in my life tomorrow. For young Americans, however, the nostalgia is hard won: only 30% of homes still have landlines. In most cases, their prized old-fashioned handsets – models from the 50s and 60s are especially popular – have been refitted so they can connect to a mobile phone network via Bluetooth. They haven’t returned to the age of the landline at all. They’ve just found a way to make placing a mobile call more difficult. In a sense, that’s what nostalgia is: a yearning to retreat to a past you don’t remember. The old landline system came with its own annoyances: the tyranny of its constant ringing, the engaged signal, the ropey service, the never knowing who might be calling. It didn’t slow life down to a more manageable pace. It just held things up. Somewhere in a box in our attic sits an old red rotary-dial phone that belonged to my wife. If you’re old enough you may recall a previous wave of nostalgia for these, in the 80s. They also had to be refitted to cope with modern wiring. You could buy them from market stalls. With any luck, the red phone will stay in that box. But I’m happy knowing it’s there, ready to plug in, so that one day, when the apocalypse comes, we will still be able to order pizza.

3/24/2022,"Boris Johnson has said Vladimir Putin has already “crossed a red line” that merits ramping up the west’s response, suggesting allies must send new weapons to Ukraine, expand curbs on international payments and target Russia’s gold reserves. Overnight, Johnson said the UK would double the number of British missiles sent to Ukraine by sending an additional 6,000, and send an extra £25m to Ukraine’s military, and officials suggested he would entreat European leaders to rapidly increase lethal aid. Speaking before a Nato and G7 summit in Brussels on Thursday, Johnson said there were a number of options to further squeeze the Russian economy and aid Ukraine’s defences. “We need to do more, and so we need to do more economically. Can we do more to stop him [Putin] using his gold reserves, for instance, in addition to his cash reserves?” he told LBC. “The more pressure we apply now, particularly on things like gold, I believe the more we can shorten the war … And then we need to do more to give the Ukrainians military support.” Nato countries are expected to agree at Thursday’s emergency summit to provide special kit to protect Ukrainians against any chemical, biological or nuclear attacks launched by Russia. Johnson said he would insist that the siege of Mariupol and the indiscriminate attacks on civilians should be seen as a new escalation, and that the use of chemical or biological weapons should not be the bar set for further punitive measures. Western officials have said the Ukrainians and the Russians are running short of weapons as the conflict grinds on owing to a Ukrainian defence that been more successful than expected – and that they had anticipated they would be supporting a smaller Ukrainian insurgency by this stage. On Wednesday the UK chief of defence intelligence, Lt Gen Sir Jim Hockenhull, said the Russian advance had stalled considerably, “surprised by the scale and ferocity of the Ukrainian resistance,” and the Kremlin was now pursuing a “strategy of attrition which will involve the reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower”. Johnson said that meant the west had to keep Ukraine supplied with weapons. “The big thing that has emerged in the last month – the huge fact that the world now knows – is that the Ukrainian people will fight for their country. They believe in their country, they love their country. They’re going to defend it,” he said. “That was something we didn’t really know a month ago. It’s now absolutely clear. That’s changed geopolitics. It means that we have a duty to help them. We have a duty to help them protect themselves and their loved ones. And so the UK is stepping up again.” Western officials said there must now be a consensus that Russia is pursuing such a “barbaric” strategy in places such as Mariupol that it should be considered to be an escalation in the war that merits a new response. “The point I’m going to make today is … he’s already crossed a threshold of barbarism in the way he’s behaving,” Johnson said. “People talk about new red lines for chemical, biological, tactical nuclear weapons or whatever. For me the red line already has been crossed. He’s bombing indiscriminately civilian centres. He’s causing huge numbers of casualties in wholly innocent populations.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will address leaders including the US president, Joe Biden, at the Nato meeting in Brussels on Thursday morning via video link. Poland is expected to present a proposal at the meeting for a multinational peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. But there is no support from the US or many other allies for a no-fly zone or any other direct Nato intervention, despite the increasingly bloody fighting. The Kremlin has warned Nato countries not to deploy peacekeepers to Ukraine, saying that could lead to a direct confrontation between Russia and Nato. A deployment would be a “reckless and extremely dangerous decision”, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said during a phone call with journalists on Wednesday. Nato leaders are also expected on Thursday to agree to increase troop deployments on its eastern flank with the creation of four new multinational battlegroups in Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary to protect against any sudden Russian attack, alongside those already established in Poland and the Baltic states. G7 and EU leaders will hold meetings later in the day, with Biden a guest at the EU summit – to which Johnson has not been invited. The other meetings are likely to focus on trying to agree a further toughening of economic sanctions.",News/Politics,"West could target Russia’s gold reserves over Ukraine, says Boris Johnson",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/24/west-could-target-russia-gold-reserves-over-ukraine-says-boris-johnson
