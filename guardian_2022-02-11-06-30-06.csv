2/11/2022,"Dame Cressida Dick joined the Metropolitan police almost 40 years ago, while she rose through the ranks and became the first female commissioner of the force, her time has been marked by controversy. 1983 – Dick joins the Met as a constable, patrolling a beat in west London. She is promoted to chief inspector within a decade.  1995 – She transfers to Thames Valley police, where she spent time working as area commander for Oxford. 2001 – Dick returns to the Met as a commander and becomes the head of Operation Trident in 2003. It is credited with reducing the number of drug gangs operating in London. 22 July 2005 – Dick is the commander of Operation Kratos and in the aftermath of the 21 July London bombings – exactly two weeks after the 7/7 attacks – she was gold commander in the room during the fatal shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes. The 27-year-old Brazilian national was repeatedly shot in the head at Stockwell tube station by officers who mistook him for a suicide bomber. While the Met was found to have made catastrophic errors that led to De Menezes’s death, Dick was cleared of any “personal culpability” for the tragedy. The De Menezes family would later call for Dick to be barred from leading the Met. 2011 – In July, Dick is appointed assistant commissioner, specialist operations, and oversees security during the 2012 Olympics in London. Later that year, she is appointed acting deputy commissioner. However, a strained relationship with the then commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, sees Dick leave the Met for a role in the Foreign Office. 22 February 2017 - Dick becomes the first ­female head of the Met, completing a remarkable career comeback. She vows to reform the force but faces immediate challenges in her first year following the terrorist attacks at Westminster, London Bridge and Finsbury Park. December 2019 – Dick was referred to the police watchdog over her handling of Operation Midland, the force’s investigation into allegations of child sexual abuse by members of the British establishment. The inquiry lasted a year and a half, cost £2.5m, and ended without a single arrest. However, the Independent Office for Police Conduct cleared Dick of allegations relating to the investigation, finding no evidence that she had “deliberately misled the public”. September 2020 - Dick faces calls to resign by Black Lives Matter activists who say she has “failed to acknowledge” racism within the force. March 2021 – Dick’s handling of the murder of Sarah Everard by serving Met officer Wayne Couzens caused anger and frustration in City Hall and government. After her killer was sentenced to a whole-life term in September 2021, the Met leadership was expected to show it understood the concerns. Instead it was mocked after saying that women who were worried about an officer approaching them could wave down a bus. The Met announced its own inquiry, as have the government. The Met was also criticised for its handling of a vigil held for Everard, which resulted in clashes and arrests. June 2021 – The Met is described as “institutionally corrupt” and Dick is personally censured for obstruction by an independent inquiry set up to review the murder of the private detective Daniel Morgan in 1987. The findings trigger calls from his brother, Alastair, for Dick to consider her position. January 2022 – Dick is criticised for the Met’s initial failure to investigate alleged parties held at Downing Street and other government offices during lockdown. The Met later confirmed it would indeed investigate. February 2022 – It emerges that a Met officer disciplined after an inquiry into misogynistic and racist messages has since been promoted. Misconduct was proven against the unnamed officer after a watchdog inquiry into messages about hitting and raping women, which were shared by up to 19 officers based mainly at Charing Cross police station.",News/UK news,Cressida Dick timeline: Met commissioner dogged by controversies,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/10/cressida-dick-timeline-a-commissioner-dogged-by-controversies

2/11/2022,"Leaders of the Ottawa “Freedom Convoy” protest have warned fellow protesters that the risk of violence is growing, amid speculation the police may move to disperse the nearly two-week occupation of Canada’s capital. Daily “intelligence reports” compiled by protest leaders and seen by the Guardian – as well as public comments by the organisers – have grown increasingly alarmist in recent days.  While the reports include misinformation, and should not be taken as credible intelligence, they nevertheless offer an insight on the occupiers’ conspiratorial mindset. Thursday’s report warns that “the Office of the Prime Minister (PMO) has directed that Freedom Convoy 2022 be dispersed by not [sic] later that [sic] Saturday, 12 February 2022.” In Canada, politicians cannot direct police operations, but the increasing paranoia of the protesters present a worrying change in tone. The reports are prepared by Tom Quiggin, a private security consultant who has previously been accused of spreading misinformation, particularly by overplaying the threat of terrorism posed by Canada’s Muslim community. Roughly 1,000 people have blockaded downtown Ottawa since late January, demanding an end to all Covid vaccine mandates. Some are calling for Justin Trudeau to step down as prime minister or be removed from office. They say their occupation will continue until their demands are met, and other protesters have since blocked the international Ambassador Bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, and two smaller border crossings. It is not clear how widely these reports are shared, but they accurately reflect the public talking points of the lead organizers. The reports portray the city’s police chief, Peter Sloly, as an antagonist, saying that he has “has played a role in creating a political space where violence can occur”. Earlier this week Tom Marazzo, a protest leader who is described as a “police liaison”, said that “the statements and actions by the Chief of Police have deliberately set the conditions for potential violence against the peaceful protesters.” The protesters insist that they are entirely peaceful, but they have resisted attempts to clear them from downtown and stop them resupplying with diesel. Local residents complain that life in the city has been made intolerable by the occupiers’ blaring truck horns and nightly fireworks. “Our city is under siege,” said Councillor Diane Deans, who described the protests as a “nationwide insurrection”. Ottawa police say they have made 23 arrests since the occupation began, which includes resistant arrest and breach of probation – another 85 criminal investigations are ongoing. Efforts to clear the occupiers have been complicated by their extensive physical infrastructure – including wooden shelters and hundreds of trucks – and the presence of children in about 100 vehicles, police say. Officers have also warned that some protesters are believed to have firearms. “We’ve been worried about how tooled up these guys are,” said a source who has been part of the city’s emergency response. The protest leaders’ reports and public comments make it clear that the occupiers will resist police attempts to move them. In a video posted online, one of the organizers told protesters to lock themselves in their trucks if the police move in. “Guys, lock that door. Crawl into that bunk. But before you do that, grab that horn switch and don’t let go let that fucking horn go, no matter what time it is, and let it roll as long as possible until they’re busting your fucking windows down,” said Chris Barber. In one report, Quiggin claims that “police forces are increasingly uneasy with their role” echoing a view among protesters that – unlike the upper echelons of the Ottawa police and Royal Canadian Mounted Police – frontline officers are sympathetic to their cause. In contrast, the report accuses Sloly and other senior officers of being aligned with “corporatist power structures”. That mentality may embolden the protesters to stand their ground. “There has been a pervasive narrative in this movement that any violence is not the fault of the protesters, but instead instigated by ‘Antifa’ … or orchestrated by the deep state,” said Stephanie Carvin, a Carleton University professor and former intelligence analyst. “In my view, this is entirely consistent with that narrative.” Quiggin’s reports also reveal the intensely conspiratorial nature of the occupation. Protesters have made constant allusions to a conspiracy theory which holds that the World Economic Forum is seeking to use the Covid pandemic to stage a “Great Reset”, which would purportedly create a “Marxian-inspired totalitarian system”. Many proponents of this conspiracy theory blame the Forum for creating Covid-19 itself. On Thursday, Quiggin’s daily intelligence report provided a “a partial list of Canadian officials who are members of the World Economic Forum”, including Trudeau, several members of his cabinet, two Conservative members of parliament and a host of other government and civil society officials. One MP on the list told the Guardian that in recent days they had received a significant increase and worrying rise in harassment and abuse mentioning the World Economic Forum. The Ottawa police force and Royal Canadian Mounted Police did not respond to requests for comment.",News/World news,Paranoia and alarmism: ‘intelligence reports’ hint at Canada truckers’ outlook,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/canada-truckers-protest-mindset-intelligence-reports
2/11/2022,"Boris Johnson said he feared Europe stood “on the edge of a precipice” as some experts declared that Russia has now assembled a force on the borders of Ukraine that would be capable of invading. On a day of rushed British diplomacy, the prime minister said he hoped Russian president, Vladimir Putin, would “disengage and de-escalate” while the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, held frosty discussions with her counterpart in Moscow and announced further sanctions legislation.  “I think today, 10 February 2022, we stand on the edge of a precipice and things are as dangerous as I have seen them in Europe for a very, very long time,” Johnson said as he completed a trip to Nato in Brussels and the Polish government in Warsaw. The prime minister, under pressure at home over whether he should resign if fined for attending lockdown-breaking parties, sought to escalate concerns about Russian intentions as the Ukraine crisis enters a decisive phase. Earlier, at Nato’s headquarters Johnson said the situation had entered “the most dangerous moment”. His words were echoed by the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, who added: “The number of Russian forces is going up. The warning time for a possible attack is going down.” Military analysts estimate Moscow has massed more than 135,000 troops on the borders of Ukraine, both in Russia and Belarus, where 10 days of joint military exercises between the two authoritarian countries began on Thursday. Some now believe nearly all the necessary elements are in place if Putin wanted to attack. Rob Lee, a Russian military expert and fellow at the Foreign Policy Institute, tweeted on Wednesday night that “the Russian military, as of this week/weekend, has the military capabilities to actually conduct a large-scale invasion”. NBC News reported that a US intelligence assessment had concluded that Russia had assembled 100 battalion tactical groups plus special forces on the borders with Ukraine, a level once considered by Washington to be a credible invasion force. Ukraine has been sceptical that Putin would risk a large-scale attack, although Kyiv fears that Moscow may attempt a more limited incursion in its south-eastern Donbas region, where a low intensity war with Russian-backed separatists has been ongoing since 2014. The country’s leader said he believed Russia’s latest tactics were familiar. Speaking to a group of European business leaders, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: “The accumulation of forces at the border is psychological pressure from our neighbours. We see nothing new here.” Johnson said the UK and Nato would not intervene militarily if Ukraine, a non Nato member, was attacked, but did suggest the UK would be willing to arm any insurgency if Russia attacked or Kyiv fell. “It’s possible, I don’t want to rule this out,” he said. Britain also unveiled its promised sanctions legislation, designed to target oligarchs who control businesses of economic or strategic significance to Russia if the Kremlin orders an invasion. That followed a day in which Truss met her counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Moscow in two hours of talks marred by an apparent display of Kremlin one-upmanship. During an icy press conference, Lavrov, a veteran of 18 years as foreign minister, said their discussions amounted to a conversation of “the mute with the deaf” and that the talks contained “nothing secret, no trust, just slogans shouted from the tribunes”. Lavrov also hinted that Russia may remove non-essential diplomatic staff from Ukraine. Truss, who became foreign secretary in September, stuck closely to her prepared remarks while fielding questions from reporters, repeating warnings that a war would be “disastrous for the Russian and Ukrainian people and for European security”. The British minister also challenged Lavrov directly over his assertion that Russia is not threatening anyone with its buildup of troops and weaponry. “I can’t see any other reason for having 100,000 troops stationed on the border, apart from to threaten Ukraine,” she said. In private discussions, Truss allegedly confused the Russian regions of Voronezh and Rostov with Ukrainian territory when Lavrov asked whether she recognised Russia’s sovereignty over them. She repeatedly told Lavrov that the UK would never recognise Moscow’s claim, until the British ambassador was forced to step in to correct her, the Russian business daily Kommersant reported. Truss partly confirmed the account in an interview with Russian press: “It seemed to me that Minister Lavrov was talking about a part of Ukraine. I have clearly indicated that these regions [Rostov and Voronezh] are part of sovereign Russia,” she said, according to the British embassy in Moscow. Britain also confirmed it had sent body armour, helmets and combat boots to Ukraine, in a statement from defence secretary Ben Wallace. Last month, Britain gave 2,000 light anti-tank weapons to Ukraine’s military, one of a number of arms shipments from the US and other European nations, intended to boost Kyiv’s ability to defend itself. Johnson said he had agreed with the Nato chief “a package of support” to boost Britain’s military contribution to eastern European members of the alliance. Britain would be “doubling the presence” of troops in Estonia, Johnson said, where the UK contributes 900 troops to a Nato battlegroup it leads. Labour leader Keir Starmer visited Nato’s headquarters a few hours after Johnson. Writing in the Guardian, he said Labour “is standing by the UK government’s approach to standing united with our allies in the face of aggression abroad” – but accused ministers of not doing enough to tackle the flow of Russian “dirty money” into the UK. Diplomatic efforts also continued. Stoltenberg said he had sent a letter earlier on Thursday to Lavrov, offering to discuss more transparency around exercises, as well as nuclear arms control. “We are prepared to listen to Russia’s concerns,” he said, adding that Nato was ready for a “serious conversation on arms control”. Wallace is scheduled to travel to Moscow for consultations with the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, on Friday. Other European leaders and officials are also shuttling between Moscow and Kyiv. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is expected in Moscow next week. But expectations for the meetings are limited as Russia has put forward maximalist demands to Nato to remove its troops from member states and to pledge never to accept Ukraine into the alliance.",News/World news,PM fears Europe on ‘precipice’ as Russia expands forces on Ukraine’s borders,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/pm-fears-europe-on-precipice-as-russia-expands-forces-on-ukraines-borders
2/11/2022,"Alain Guiraudie is emerging as a distinctive, perplexing, even exasperating film-maker. In a 20-year career in French cinema, he has long had a soft spot for the playful, the anarchic and the fantastical. Yet maybe we outside France were misled by his outlier hit in 2013, Stranger By the Lake. This was the film with which Guiraudie made his sensational international breakthrough: a gripping homoerotic cruising thriller. This was my own introduction to his work and perhaps it was the atypically serious tone of that which caused me to be disconcerted by the directionless silliness of his follow-up Rester Vertical, or Staying Vertical, in 2016. Now here is a semi-comic social satire or whimsy; or a jeu d’esprit whose esprit is difficult to locate. It has various themes and ideas which Guiraudie seems unable to take seriously and be successfully funny about. It is a weird caper which comports itself as realist drama, while also laboriously tipping us the wink about its obvious absurdity. The setting is Clermont-Ferrand in central France, where Médéric (Jean-Charles Clichet) is a software designer, a tubby, schlubby guy in his mid-30s who lives alone. We see him one afternoon looking entranced at a total stranger in the street with whom he has evidently fallen in love: Isadora (Noémie Lvovsky) a woman in her 50s who sells sex. He brazenly approaches her, declaring that he wants to make love to her without paying, because that is beneath him.  Mystifyingly finding him sufficiently attractive to waive the fee, Isadora agrees to meet him in a scuzzy local hotel and is transported by his sexual prowess. There are some droll parts here for Yves-Robert Viala as the hotel’s elderly proprietor M Renard, and Miveck Packa as Charlène, a teenager interested in hotel management who is doing a highly unsuitable after-school job as a receptionist. Just as Médéric is reaching his climax, the whole city is blasted by a terrorist bomb, and Isadora’s hatchet-faced husband Gérard (Renaud Rutten) shows up in the hotel room and drags her away. In the new citywide paranoid mood, Médéric becomes convinced that the homeless north African kid Selim (Ilies Kadri) who is hanging around his apartment block is a terrorist. Selim becomes involved in a bizarre farcical imbroglio involving all these people, including Médéric’s colleague Florence (Doria Tillier) who also finds him very attractive. At one level, Guiraudie is signalling to us that this is all a big joke: he even has Gérard tell Médéric that he is flattered that a “hunk” like him finds his wife attractive. But what really is Nobody’s Hero about? It’s a romp, but a very flavourless romp. There are moments in which the waywardness of the movie has something Buñuelian about it, but that is more a matter of Médéric’s dreams, from which our hero must awaken in a cold sweat. Islamophobia and far-right neurosis have something to do with it, but the movie is not so much satirising these as shrugging at them. The film stands or falls by its claims to deadpan comedy – but this is heavy-handed and unsatisfying.  Nobody’s Hero screens at the Berlin film festival.",Arts/Film,"Nobody’s Hero review – an unsatisfying, flavourless romp",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/10/nobodys-hero-review-an-unsatisfying-flavourless-romp
