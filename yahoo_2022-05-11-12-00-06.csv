5/11/2022,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for the Republican Party to participate in climate change and make it a bipartisan issue while speaking at the opening session of the Aspen Ideas Climate Conference in Miami. Pelosi wanted the party to go back to its roots and back to the time when it cared for women’s rights and also the environment among other great things. She wondered how no one in the senate cared about the climate and the impact of fossil fuels on it. She claimed that though some members care about it they back out when it is time to vote. “Here I am Nancy Pelosi saying this country needs a strong Republican Party and we do; not a cult, but a strong Republican Party,” she said. Pelosi has always voiced her voiced concerns regarding women’s rights. While talking about the leaked draft of the Supreme Court Roe v Wade decision she criticized the opinion on overturning the 1973 landmark decision and said that it was an assault on women and a lack of respect for them and their judgment.",Politics/The Recount,"Pelosi: ""I want the Republican Party to take back the party to... when you cared about a woman's right to choose"".",https://news.yahoo.com/pelosi-want-republican-party-back-165904398.html
5/11/2022,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) tried to revise history on Monday, but was busted by his own past comments. As Fox News footage showed a peaceful protest in favor of abortion rights, Cruz slammed members of the crowd as “goons” and warned of “escalation.” Then, he defended the right-wing mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021: Ted Cruz rewrites history by claiming the January 6 insurrectionists were ""peacefully protesting,"" in contrast with the people demonstrating outside Alito's house pic.twitter.com/OMFVOURMrW — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) May 10, 2022 That’s very different from what Cruz has said in the past. Progressive PAC MeidasTouch contrasted Cruz’s words this week with his previous comments about Jan. 6 rioters, who he called “terrorists” who committed a “violent assault on the Capitol.” .@TedCruz is a shameless liar pic.twitter.com/oEou9JWRwi — MeidasTouch.com (@MeidasTouch) May 10, 2022 Earlier this year, Cruz was widely mocked for a “groveling” and “humiliating” appearance on Fox News in which he desperately tried to take back those words. It didn’t go well. “The way I phrased things yesterday it was sloppy and it was frankly dumb,” Cruz told Tucker Carlson during the awkward interview in January. Carlson was unconvinced. “I guess I just don’t believe you,” Carlson said. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

5/11/2022,"One of John McCain's former top aides alleged the late GOP senator lied about his relationship with a lobbyist. Steve Schmidt claimed he lied on the Senator's behalf to discredit a New York Times article. ""For 14 years I have remained silent because I didn't want to do anything to compromise John McCain's honor,"" Schmidt said. One of John McCain's former top aides said Sunday that he lied to discredit a New York Times article that reported on McCain's close relationship with a lobbyist. In an essay posted to Substack on Sunday, Steve Schmidt — the senior strategist for McCain's 2008 presidential campaign — said ""John McCain's lie became mine."" Schmidt said he knew about McCain's close relationship with the lobbyist and lied to protect the reputations of McCain and his family. The New York Times reported in 2018 that lobbyist Vicki Iseman was receiving special treatment from the GOP presidential candidate, and shared speculation from some that their relationship may have turned romantic. Both John McCain and his wife, Cindy, denied the accusations of a relationship at a press conference. ""Immediately following the story's publication, John and Cindy McCain both lied to the American people at a news conference that I prepared them for on that same day,"" Schmidt wrote. Schmidt said that after the article came out — which he said ""accurately detailed that relationship"" — McCain told him the truth about the relationship backstage at an event in Ohio. ""For 14 years I have remained silent because I didn't want to do anything to compromise John McCain's honor,"" Schmidt said after apologizing to the Times journalists who wrote the story. He said that McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, ""abused and bullied"" him to stay silent in the last 14 years. ""The truth is the only remedy that I know to make Meghan's abuse stop,"" he said. ""The truth requires that – at long last – I speak out. It is not a story that I relish telling, but I must because my continued silence stipulates the validity of untrue allegations and petty slanders."" Representatives for Meghan McCain said she declined to comment on the post, as she ""hasn't spoken to [Schmidt] in 14 years."" Of McCain's legacy, Schmidt concluded: ""It is time to look up and out. It is time to look for new leaders. It is time to move on.""
