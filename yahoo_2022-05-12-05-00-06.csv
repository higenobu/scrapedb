5/12/2022,"When Bobbi Loeb, 81, moved into her house in a scenic rural area 40 miles north of San Francisco half a century ago, her neighbors were mostly cattle ranchers. “My son had a hard time in school because he was considered a hippie,” she says. Now the area is home to Silicon Valley transplants and Loeb’s property is worth over $1 million. Loeb, who lives on Social Security benefits and limited rental income from two separate units on her property, was facing a dilemma last year. She couldn’t afford to maintain the buildings, which needed roof and septic repairs, but couldn’t bear the thought of increasing rent on her tenants or moving. “I just couldn't do it,” she says about charging market rates for her rentals. “It was just so bizarre to be a landlady after all my experiences as a renter.” She found a middle ground with the Community Land Trust of West Marin (CLAM), an organization whose mission is to ensure that Marin County remains affordable for low and middle-income residents. This year, Loeb sold her property to CLAM for half its market value. She’s the first participant of the trust’s age-in-place initiative, which lets longtime homeowners stay in their homes while the trust takes over their upkeep. When Loeb dies, CLAM will turn the property into affordable housing units, helping to mitigate the housing crisis affecting the Bay Area. “There will be three affordable units,” says Loeb. “That makes me feel happy.” Loeb says that aging in place is a big deal when you’ve lived in a community as long as she has. She remembers people asking her why she didn’t just sell the property for what it was worth. “And where would I live?” was her response. “I would have to leave here.” Loeb says her roots are deep in the community: “I know so many people, and so many people know me.” She remembers going to the post office recently with her 6-year-old grandson and him turning to her after noticing her greet everyone she passed. “He said, ‘You must know everybody,’” she says. “And I do.” When CLAM acquires a property, the organization can decide to either sell or rent it as affordable housing, according to Pam Dorr, the trust’s executive director. CLAM currently houses 66 people and owns 18 rental units. The organization has also coordinated two home ownerships. “The properties stay permanently affordable, and the land under the homes is retained in perpetuity by the land trust, so it's community-controlled housing,” says Dorr. West Marin started to change soon after Loeb bought her house. She remembers wondering: “God, I don't know how we're going to make this mortgage,” and her real estate broker assuring her that in only a few years the payments would be the same as monthly rent in the area. Sure enough, he was right, and prices have only continued to rise. Loeb’s decision to sell was just as helpful for CLAM as it was for her. “It's a very challenging environment to create affordable housing and to acquire properties,” says Ruth Lopez, CLAM’s program director, about Marin County’s real estate market. “We can’t buy properties at market rate and turn them into affordable housing projects.” She says that since Loeb sold her house to CLAM, the trust has seen interest from other older members of the community in its age-in-place initiative. Dorr says the initiative has strong community support. “Lots of folks who live in the community want to make sure essential workers, teachers, and people who work at the bakery can stay living where they work,” she says. A community land trust, says Dorr, is a more flexible model of affordable housing than the more common model built using low-income tax credits, which subsidize the acquisition, construction, and renovation of affordable rentals. “[That model] takes a long time and really excludes the local community in making decisions about how the housing is managed,” she says, adding that only qualified developers can develop that model of housing. Affordable housing built using low-income tax credits also often come with minimum unit requirements. “And in rural areas, you're typically not going to have that type of density,” says Dorr. CLAM’s approach to affordable housing, and specifically its age-in-place initiative, also involves a philosophical shift in thinking about community development. “It’s a pivot away from how much can I get and what's best for me to what's best for my community,” says Lopez. “That shift in thinking is what will mitigate the housing crisis.” Bobbi says it’s the sense of community that has led her to stay in Marin County all these years. Decades ago, a boiler exploded in one of the units on the property, burning her ex-husband and young daughter as the unit burned down. While they spent several weeks in the hospital, the entire community worked together to rebuild the unit before they returned. She says that hasn’t changed. “People help each other here, says Loeb. “They look out for each other here. It’s just a wonderful community.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",U.S./Fortune,This 81-year-old Californian sold her $1 million home for half its value so it could become affordable housing after she dies,https://news.yahoo.com/81-old-californian-sold-her-120000901.html
5/12/2022,"A woman has incited a debate on TikTok after complaining about unpaid lunch hours. Buy, sell or hold? How to decide what to do with a plummeting stock TikTok user Jess (@genericjess420) said that she always thought work was from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and was shocked to find out that a lot of jobs actually last from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and are broken up by an unpaid lunch hour. See this Manhattan apartment get an unbelievable maximalist makeover with just $1,000: “When did everyone collectively decide to sneak another hour in the workday for lunch that they won’t pay us for,” Jess wrote in the text overlay on her video. Unpaid meal breaks vary from state to state. In California, employees must receive a 30-minute meal break for every five hours they work, while in New York, it’s a break for every six hours. And in New York, employees also aren’t allowed to opt out of their lunch breaks and should not do any work during that meal period. The Fair Labor Standards Act, which is the federal wage law, does not require employers to provide meal breaks. Commenters agreed with Jess’s frustration over the situation. “IT’S A SCAM, people. Scam,” one person wrote. “Literally been lied to my whole life,” another agreed. “The unpaid lunch hour is a scam and such a strain on workers,” a commenter said.

5/12/2022,"Three male TSA agents told Emily Calandrelli she couldn't take two ice packs on a flight, she said. Calandrelli needed an ice pack to keep her breast milk cool during a five-hour flight. She said she planned to pump right before her flight to avoid breast pain but couldn't. Emily Calandrelli, a California mother of a 10-week-old baby, said she felt humiliated and ashamed after she gave two male security agents at the Los Angeles International Airport a heads-up that she had two ice packs with her. Calandrelli wanted to pump breast milk between going through airport security and boarding her five-hour flight. The ice packs would help keep the milk cold on her trip Monday from Los Angeles to Washington, DC, until she could store the milk in a hotel freezer. But when she got to the Transportation Security Administration checkpoint, two agents told her she couldn't bring them on the flight because one of them wasn't frozen solid, Calandrelli told Insider. TSA permits ""frozen liquid items"" aboard an aircraft if they're ""frozen solid"" when going through the check, according to TSA screening guidelines. Gel ice packs are permitted on a plane in any form if they're ""medically necessary."" A breastfeeding woman who skips pumping sessions is at risk for severe pain and infection. Breasts filled with milk harden and become engorged, which can result in a bacterial infection called mastitis. In some instances, mastitis cases lead to hospitalization and intravenous antibiotic treatment. ""I think we could argue that pumping and feeding our child and doing this even when our child is not with us is absolutely medically necessary,"" Calandrelli said. When she had her first kid, Calandrelli, who frequently travels for her job as a TV-show host, used to run into the same problem. TSA agents would ""give me trouble"" about the ice packs in her luggage, she said. But they normally ""would let it go"" and let her on the plane, she added. But on Monday, the TSA barred her from bringing ice packs on the aircraft, Calandrelli said in a Twitter thread. The two agents, both men, told her she wouldn't be able to bring them through, she said. Calandrelli then asked to speak with a female TSA agent instead of the two men, hoping she'd be able to connect with a mother who'd breastfed before. A male supervisor walked over to Calandrelli and told her to check her luggage and store the ice packs in it throughout the flight, she said. As other TSA agents and travelers looked on, Calandrelli and the supervisor argued, she added. Calandrelli said the supervisor told her there wouldn't be an issue if she had the milk itself. Calandrelli usually pumps every four to five hours, she said. She said she tried to explain to him that she wanted to pump before her flight to avoid pain in her breasts while flying. The supervisor then asked where the baby was, she said. The baby, Calandrelli said she told him, was at home. After a person gives birth, their breasts produce a continuous supply of milk, regardless of whether a baby is nearby. ""It was very clear that they just didn't understand how breastfeeding worked,"" Calandrelli said. ""I felt humiliated because I'm trying to explain to these grown men how my boobs work,"" she added. ""And I'm like, 'This is your job. You guys should be trained to know this. I shouldn't have to want to ask for a female agent who might know how to do your job better. That shouldn't be the case.' And so I felt ashamed like I had — I had done something wrong."" A TSA spokesperson told Insider the agency took ""all traveler concerns about our security checkpoint screening processes seriously and are committed to ensuring that every traveler is treated respectfully and courteously."" The TSA statement added: ""We will look into all circumstances involving this situation and address it appropriately."" Calandrelli said she knew the risk of not pumping and feared getting on the plane without doing so. After the argument, she conceded, leaving the security checkpoint to return to the bag-check station at the terminal. She said she cried on her way back, hoping she wouldn't catch an infection. ""I'm trying to be a working mom and feed my kid and also not have an infection while I do it,"" she said. On the plane, Calandrelli said she could feel her breasts hardening because she didn't pump ahead of her flight. ""It feels just like a lot of pressure and pain,"" she said. ""I felt nauseous and sweaty, and it was just like, 'I need to empty these boobs out if there's going to be a problem.'"" She didn't feel comfortable pumping on the plane because it takes 30 minutes and she didn't want to be in the bathroom for that long, Calandrelli said. She added that pumping outside the airplane bathroom wasn't an option because her pump required an electrical outlet. ""It's so hard to pump milk, and that stuff is very precious,"" Calandrelli said. Her experience is yet another incident in which a mom has run into difficulty at the airport over breastfeeding. Shawn Johnson, an Olympic gymnast and gold medalist, said TSA agents ""groped"" her in October while she traveled through security with breast milk. A woman was told last year she couldn't take the breast milk that she'd spent days pumping for her 4- and 9-month-old sons onto a flight. Since speaking out publicly on Twitter, Calandrelli told Insider she'd heard from other moms who had similar experiences at the airport. ""I think so many women have this experience, and it makes them not want to travel anymore,"" Calandrelli said. ""Because I can see how this type of experience can lead to a feeling of trauma.""
