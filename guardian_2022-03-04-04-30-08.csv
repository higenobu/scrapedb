3/4/2022,"The fall of the first Ukrainian city to the Russian army bodes ill for the rest of the country. Russian forces, reports suggest, surrounded and starved the southern Dnieper River port of Kherson into submission. Kherson’s mayor told reporters that many citizens had been left dead and unrecognisable by high-calibre weapons used by the Russians to bombard his city. Vladimir Putin’s siege tactics, familiar to anyone who remembers Russia’s role in the 2017 battle for Aleppo in Syria, today amount to war crimes. Russian soldiers are threatening to destroy Ukrainian cities unless they surrender. The mayor of Mariupol, on the Black Sea, said that Mr Putin’s army was attacking rail lines and road bridges, as well as cutting off water and electricity, to prevent civilians from escaping the shelling. In 2014, Mr Putin described Kyiv as “the mother of Russian cities”. That his military is preparing to encircle the Ukrainian capital with enough firepower to leave it a charred ruin shows his potential descent into criminal folly. One can only hope that one day the Russian president will be sitting in a dock at The Hague where his ramblings can be exposed for what they are: no defence for the senseless killing of innocents. The criminality of Mr Putin’s invasion is staggering. He is sowing death and panic in Ukraine, with apparent little regard for civilian lives. His war is only a week old and Russian forces are already raining down cluster munitions on residential areas. Airstrikes, Ukrainian officials claim, hit schools and homes in the Chernihiv region. The French president’s assessment after talking to Mr Putin that the “worst is still to come” in Ukraine is unlikely to be a scare tactic. Some of Mr Putin’s own troops appear to have no stomach for an offensive war in Ukraine on the basis that they are, as Moscow claims, protecting Russia’s strategic interests. Instead the Ukrainian military casts opposing soldiers as hapless teenage invaders and wretched conscripts. Forcing poor young men to fight in an illegal war ought to be added to the list of charges Mr Putin might face. Public opinion in the west will make it hard for European and US leaders to stand by while Ukrainians are slaughtered. Western nations are already sending arms to Ukraine’s army, though they have backed away from providing more fighter jets. Unless hostilities cease, anti-Moscow sentiment will only intensify in the coming weeks, and western leaders have a responsibility not to yield to reckless arguments about Nato confronting Russia militarily in a no-fly zone over Ukraine. More than 1 million people have already fled the violence – with more to come. European countries are right to push for the creation of humanitarian corridors to allow the evacuation of civilians from war zones. There are some encouraging signs that such a proposal might be agreed in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. More than two centuries ago, Joseph de Maistre, the Sardinian kingdom’s diplomatic envoy to the tsarist court, noted Russians’ political apathy in observing that “every nation has the government it deserves”. But countries move on. Before the outbreak of war, polls showed support for Mr Putin. That might change as sanctions bite. Moscow has already seen bank runs and street protests. Rumours have swept the capital Moscow that martial law is about to be imposed – but they were denied by the Kremlin on Thursday. However, the Russian authorities appear to be preparing the public for tough times ahead, notably by admitting hundreds of deaths among its troops fighting in Ukraine. Russians understandably worry what might happen if they rock the boat. Mr Putin knows that his public fear the government; but he is gambling that they fear being left to fend for themselves even more.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Putin’s siege tactics in Ukraine: a war crime by another name | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/03/the-guardian-view-on-putins-siege-tactics-in-ukraine-a-war-by-another-name
3/4/2022,"Sir Philip Augar’s review of post-18 education in England was commissioned by Theresa May in 2018, after the then prime minister was spooked by the popularity of Jeremy Corbyn’s election pledge to abolish student tuition fees. Four years later, the government’s response is finally in. But the reforms it unveiled last week are mainly about saving the Treasury money, rather than students. They are also shamelessly, and calculatedly, regressive. Although it talks a good game on adult and further education, the government’s policy priority has always been to slash the amount of university graduate debt that is never paid back – and for which the Treasury is on the hook. It has thus extended from 30 to 40 years the period in which loan repayments must be made, and substantially lowered the salary threshold at which money starts to be paid back. The number of graduates required to pay back their loan in full is expected to rise from under a quarter to more than half. In partial compensation, high interest rates levied on loans will be cut. But this move will overwhelmingly benefit high-earning graduates. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that, overall, the changes will save the Treasury £2.3bn for each university cohort. This is money that will be coming from graduates on extremely modest salaries who already have house prices and meagre pensions to worry about. The regressive approach is compounded by the government’s apparent aspiration to reintroduce minimum GCSE and A-level entry requirements for university – a move that would further entrench social inequalities in educational attainment. An ominous consultation has also been launched on how to deal with “poor-quality” courses that fail to deliver well-paid graduate jobs. This looks like a backdoor route to reintroducing caps on student numbers in some areas, as well as a licence for philistine judgments on what constitutes the “value” of university learning. The freezing of tuition fees until 2025 will lead to a hefty real-terms cut in universities’ income and hit teaching resources. That will further depress staff morale on campuses, where many lecturers have just completed another round of strike action over pensions and working conditions. It all amounts to a stealthy and painful Whitehall squeeze on the higher education sector: the net effect of the financial reforms will be to make the prospect of a university education appreciably less attractive to some, and more of a perceived gamble. This is the intention. The government wants fewer young people to do degrees and more to consider further education colleges, apprenticeships and vocational training as viable alternatives. The Augar review itself called for a rebalancing of this kind. But notwithstanding the welcome proposal of a lifelong loan entitlement for non-graduates from 2025, nothing like enough money is being spent to reverse the impact of a decade of savage cuts to the further education sector. Instead, the government is taking the dismal but cheaper option of upping disincentives to take the academic route. As the financial war of attrition on our universities continues, the only true winner from the government’s response to the Augar review is the Treasury.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on new reforms to student loans: putting on the squeeze | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/03/the-guardian-view-on-new-reforms-to-student-loans-putting-on-the-squeeze
3/4/2022,"Anotable name of the London Stock Exchange’s fresh 27-strong list of suspended stocks was PhosAgro, the giant fertiliser group backed by Russia billionaire businessman Andrei Guriev, the reported owner of Witanhurst, London’s second largest home after Buckingham Palace. PhosAgro is chaired by none other than Xavier Rolet, the LSE’s long-serving chief executive until late 2017. He got the Russian gig a few months after stepping down. We are yet to hear from Rolet on whether he intends to stay in post at PhosAgro, but the general pan-European advice from fellow directors seems clear: it’s time to get off Russian boards. Rolet is French, so here’s the version of a co-ordinated campaigning message from the European Confederation of Directors’ Associations: “Board members should question their mandates in Russian and Belarusian companies.” The UK’s Institute of Directors weighed in for its audience here: “Although directors owe legal duties to the companies on whose boards they serve, they should also feel a stronger moral duty to uphold the fundamental values of freedom and democracy.” That line could almost have been written with Lord Barker in mind. The Conservative peer and former minister remains the well-remunerated executive chair at EN+, the Russian aluminium firm whose owners include the oligarch Oleg Deripaska. That is despite calls from Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, for him to resign. Barker’s view is that, “whatever the optics”, he has duties to the company’s workforce, including several thousand in Ukraine, and he will not “shirk that responsibility”. It’s a point of view, but there’s no getting away from the fact that he’s sitting atop a large and important Russian company. The IoD’s view is the one to prefer: “It is no longer tenable for British directors to be involved in governance roles in the Russian economy.” This stuff should not be complicated. Meanwhile, say goodbye from the FTSE 100 index to Evraz and Polymetal – not because the Russian duo are on the LSE’s expanded list of suspended stocks, but for the humdrum reason that their share prices have crashed so severely that they don’t make the cut on market capitalisation grounds. Both Evraz, the steel and mining business where Roman Abramovich is the biggest shareholder, and Polymetal have plunged in value by more than 80% since Russia invaded Ukraine. How, you may wonder, were they members of London’s blue-chip index in the first place? The answer, of course, is that FTSE 100 reflects nothing other than itself. If a company has a premium listing in London and has a free float in its shares of 25% (or 50% if non-UK incorporated), and ticks the governance boxes, it’s eligible for inclusion. Then it’s a matter of pure stock market size. It is on this basis that the index also includes names with few direct links to the UK such as Fresnillo (a Mexican silver miner), Antofagasta (a Chile-focused copper miner majority-owned by a local billionaire’s family) and the Swiss-incorporated Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company. The LSE’s open-doors policy on listings has always been wider than Russia. There’s surely a gap in the market for an alternative benchmark that is purer assembly of large UK companies. Dominance by banks, insurers and oil companies would generate even more grumbles about “dinosaur” hasbeens that are obsessed with paying dividends. But such exposures are what many private investors want from a low-cost tracker fund. “Our ambitions in the streaming world are not world domination,” declared Carolyn McCall, chief executive of ITV. Thank goodness for that, shareholders may feel. Even a plan to be a national streaming champion sent the share price crashing by 27%, which equates to more than £1bn of stock market value. Was the plan such a shocker? Not really. ITV will have to ramp up spending on programming by £160m next year as it launches ITVX, the new streaming service, which probably implies a couple of years of going backwards in terms of profits. But the alternative was a counsel of despair – just let Netflix, Disney, Amazon mop up every last digital pound in the UK. ITV still has to demonstrate that it can achieve McCall’s target of at least double-digital revenues to £750m by 2026, but it’s not as if Coronation Street and other advertising home-bankers are about to disappear from linear-viewed screens. A “digital first” approach is not risk-free but there really ought to be room for a UK-focused streaming service to duck and weave between globally designed US output.",News/Business,Whether to quit as director of Russian board is not complicated,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/03/whether-to-quit-from-a-russian-board-is-hardly-a-complicated-decision
3/4/2022,"Some members of Kyiv’s diplomatic corps have moved to the western city of Lviv, others have crossed the border and are working from neighbouring countries, while most havebeen evacuated back home. But inside the Polish embassy compound in the centre of an eerily quiet Kyiv, the ambassador Bartosz Cichocki is still at work. “It was rather 24/7,” he said, of his working week since the Russian attack on Ukraine began. Dressed in chinos and a Shakhtar Donetsk football shirt, Cichocki offered whiskey and cigarettes to his visitors in a meeting room at the embassy, a Soviet modernist building in central Kyiv. He is the only remaining EU ambassador in the capital and one of just a handful of western diplomats of any rank remaining in Kyiv, but answered questions about his continued presence with studied nonchalance. In response to a question about whether he was sleeping underground, Cichocki said: “Why? People sleep in beds. Why should I sleep in a basement?” Hundreds of thousands of residents who remained in the capital are spending the night sleeping in metro stations or basements. A large part of the city’s population has fled Kyiv on trains and in cars, towards the safer western part of the country or across the border to Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania or Moldova. Poland, in particular, has taken in hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, and an enormous civil society effort has been launched to help get them settled in the country. If the war continues and intensifies, many millions more may flee. Cichocki said that, while he does not make policy, he would be surprised if his country would start to reject entry to Ukrainians. “I don’t think there’s a limit. I cannot imagine that Poland closes the door,” he said. Some have pointed out a troubling difference between the enormous effort by Poland and other central eastern European countries to welcome Ukrainians, and their actions towards refugees from the Middle East. In particular, Polish police violently pushed thousands of refugees back in Belarus last autumn, after the dictator Alexander Lukashenko had lured them to the country with a promise of free passage to Europe. “This is a genuine refugee phenomenon while that was completely artificial. It was refugee tourism,” Cichocki claimed. In the run-up to the invasion, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy criticised western countries for moving their diplomatic missions to Lviv, in the west of Ukraine. Cichocki said that while there were many tasks that could only be done by being physically in place, the most important reason to stay in Kyiv was symbolic. “I believe that today what we can influence is the morale, the spirit. They have arms, they have food, they have everything, but I think leaving them now would be something that could decrease their spirits,” he said. The US embassy left Kyiv for Lviv well before the Russian attack, and once the assault began, the Americans evacuated further, and the embassy team now works from across the border in Poland. Some missions are based in Lviv, while the vast majority of diplomats and almost all of their families have been evacuated back to their own capitals. “They are not free to decide, their capitals decided. I don’t judge,” Cichocki said, of his long-departed colleagues in the diplomatic corps. He was reluctant to talk about his own contingency plans, insisting that as long as a democratically elected Ukrainian government remained in place, he would be in Kyiv, describing the city as “un-invadable”. He conceded he would leave if he was ordered to do so by his foreign ministry, but doubted such an order was imminent. Outside the embassy, central Kyiv was deserted on Thursday, with few people in the streets save for the queues outside pharmacies and food shops. A missile strike on the television tower on Tuesday killed at least five people, but the city has been relatively quiet in the past two days, although the occasional boom can be heard from fighting to the west and there were several small explosions audible while the ambassador spoke. There is a sense of dread in the air at what might be coming, particularly after Vladimir Putin made a public appearance on Thursday giving little sign he was ready to back down. Residents have seen footage of indiscriminate shelling in the second city of Kharkiv and fear the same fate may await them in Kyiv. “I cannot imagine Russians taking this city by land, [but] they may destroy it, they may shell and bomb it,” said Cichocki.",News/World news,‘We can influence morale’: Polish ambassador last to remain in Kyiv ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/we-can-influence-morale-bartosz-cichocki-polish-ambassador-last-to-remain-in-kyiv
3/4/2022,"So, for Roman Abramovich, after 19 years of being garlanded in Britain for the glittering success his money bought for Chelsea football club, the game is finally up. A whole era, in which the government, Premier League and crowds of London professionals were untroubled by the well-documented way the Russian oligarch amassed his fortunes, crashed when Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine. Now with the immediate threat of sanctions, speeches in parliament linking him to corruption and Putin, he has put Chelsea up for sale. Yet just three weeks ago, Chelsea won the Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi, and Abramovich went on the pitch to lay hands on the trophy. The universally familiar sight of his winning smile being broadcast around the world was abruptly switched for a different image when the Labour MP Chris Bryant got up in the Commons last Thursday . Bryant called for sanctions on Abramovich and quoted a Home Office document written in 2019, after the novichok poisoning in Salisbury of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal. “As part of HMG’s [Her Majesty’s government] Russia strategy aimed at targeting illicit finance and malign activity,” the document read. “Abramovich remains of interest to HMG due to his links to the Russian state and his public association with corrupt activity and practices. An example of this is Abramovich admitting in court proceedings that he paid for political influence.” Chelsea sources maintained the position that Abramovich is not involved in politics and has done nothing to merit being sanctioned, but within a week he was looking for an exit and selling the club. Bryant’s statement in parliament should not have come as any kind of revelation. The challenge to the British establishment posed by the upending of Abramovich’s reputation is not why it took so long for these issues to be known – because they have been known for years. Bryant confirmed to the Guardian the case referred to in that Home Office document was the landmark high court claim Abramovich successfully defended in 2012, brought by his erstwhile oligarch mentor, Boris Berezovsky. The trial took place in public in the heart of London, with some of the English legal system’s most prestigious people involved – Abramovich was represented by Jonathan Sumption QC, who was afterwards appointed a supreme court judge. The judgment in the case delivered by Mrs Justice Gloster setout in detail how Abramovich’s fortune was forged in the “wild east” of post-communist Russia. The document Bryant read out in parliament did not expose unknown facts; it only revealed that somebody in the Home Office had actually read the judgment and, seven years later in 2019, had given the case some attention. Berezovsky’s claim was that he and Abramovich had a partnership agreement to share the enormous fortunes generated by the formation of the huge Russian oil company Sibneft, and the cut-price, mostly rigged auctions that delivered it to Abramovich’s ownership. Abramovich’s own defence, led by Sumption, was that there was no formal agreement, and that Abramovich had paid Berezovsky approximately $2bn (£1.49bn) for political protection and influence, principally with Russia’s then president Boris Yeltsin. The details that emerged in the hearings are a shocking reminder of how Russia’s industries, all state-owned under communism, appear to have been transferred to a handful of individuals, who became oligarchs while most of the population was impoverished. The judgment, and both Abramovich and Berezovsky in their own evidence, were clear that Yeltsin created Sibneft by decree after Berezovsky promised that he would use income from the resulting oil giant to fund a TV company that would give Yeltsin favourable coverage. Gloster – ultimately finding in favour of Abramovich, on the basis that there was no formal agreement with Berezovksy and he had been paying for political influence – noted that Russia in the 1990s was “not governed by the rule of law.” Ambitious people needed “krysha,” a Russian word that originally meant paying violent criminals for physical protection, and was extended to protection provided by politicians and bureaucrats. “It was Mr Abramovich’s case that the relationship between Mr Berezovsky and himself was founded principally on political krysha, or protection,” the judgment states. “He claimed that the relationship with Mr Berezovsky included … an element of physical, as well as political, protection.” The physical protection was provided by Berezovsky’s associate, a “hard man” from Georgia, Badri Patarkatsishvili. In a crucial passage, Gloster then noted: It was also Mr Abramovich’s case that the lobbying activities of Mr Berezovsky, as a protector providing political krysha for Mr Abramovich, were inherently corrupt; and that, likewise, the deal between the two men, whereby Mr Abramovich agreed to pay Mr Berezovsky for his krysha services, was also corrupt. Mr Sumption accepted that Mr Abramovich was privy to that corruption but submitted that the reality was that that was how business was done in Russia in those times. The narrative runs into the arrival of Putin, who is famously reported to have warned the oligarchs against encroaching on his power. Berezovsky misjudged the seriousness of this shift, his TV station did criticise Putin, and in fear of his life, he fled Russia for Britain. Abramovich made no such missteps. “Mr Abramovich enjoyed very good relations with President Putin and others in power at the Kremlin,” the judgment records. “It was also clear that Mr Abramovich had privileged access to President Putin, in the sense that he could arrange meetings and discuss matters with him.” This ruling in his favour saved Abramovich approximately $5bn claimed by Berezovsky, but in the decade since his representatives have sought to play down the elements cited by Bryant’s Home Office document. They have said Gloster’s note about Abramovich’s case was due to Sumption’s opening speech having perhaps been mistakenly recorded, and that Abramovich did not in fact acknowledge that the means by which he acquired Sibneft was corrupt. On Putin, they downplay the extent of the relationship, pointing to observations such as this in the judgment: “Mr Abramovich himself accepted that he was regarded by Mr Berezovsky and Mr Patarkatsishvili as ‘close to people in power in Moscow’. But, as [the senior Kremlin administrator Aleksandr] Voloshin explained, at the time, he was not a member of President Putin’s ‘inner circle’.” Thomas Tuchel, Chelsea’s manager, lost patience with the persistent questions this week and said he did not know enough about the club’s owner to answer them. Nor, clearly, did many people who have played and worked for Chelsea, and supported Abramovich, through nearly 20 years of celebrated ownership. But all of them could and arguably should have known, because the information is public and has been there throughout. Before the court case, even in 2003 when Abramovich bought Chelsea, there were already books on Russia’s post-communist tragedy; the Sibneft auction was covered in Sale of the Century, by the then FT journalist, now Canada’s finance minister, Chrystia Freeland. Yet as the money rolled in, and football’s allure cast its magical spell, too few people seemed to care. Until Putin attacked Ukraine, that is, and reality finally bit.",News/World news,Roman’s empire: the rise and fall of Abramovich’s reign at Chelsea ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/roman-empire-rise-fall-abramovich-reign-chelsea-fc

Flames and black smoke could be seen in the air above Dalton Mills, a Grade II-listed building, in Dalton Lane, Keighley. There are no reports of any injuries. West Yorkshire fire and rescue service said 20 pumps were sent to the 19th century building just before noon and all of the complex has been affected by flames. The fire service advised people living nearby to keep windows and doors closed and to avoid travelling through the area because of the smoke.

3/4/2022,"Jesse Marsch acknowledges he was torn when the voice on the other end of the phone asked whether he would be prepared to replace Marcelo Bielsa at short notice. As he addressed a roomful of reporters at Leeds United’s training ground near Wetherby wearing a box-fresh club tracksuit, Bielsa’s impressively open successor detailed how his life was transformed after the struggling team’s 6-0 defeat at Liverpool last week. “I wanted to see Marcelo continue his legacy and keep the team up and I wanted to make that argument with Victor [Orta, Leeds director of football] when he called me eight days ago,” said Marsch. “I wanted Marcelo to finish on a high note but I could see the group suffering.” Accordingly when Leeds lost 4-0 at home to Tottenham last Saturday and Bielsa was swiftly sacked, Marsch’s mind was made up. The manager, who left his last job at Leipzig in December, confirmed he had been talking to Orta about eventually succeeding Bielsa for the past two years, with the pair establishing powerful philosophical connectivity. “Being a good fit where you vibe with everything around you is often the most important thing you need as a manager,” he said. “It’s about finding people that care about the same things and that connection has made my first few days here a joy. I believe in this project so much. The 48-year-old – a big managerial hit at Red Bull Salzburg – intends to debunk a certain prejudice surrounding American coaches in English football. “I get it,” said Marsch, whose first assignment is at Leicester on Saturday. “I think there’s probably a stigma. People hate hearing the word soccer. I’m not sure Ted Lasso [the hapless sitcom character] has helped. But I’ve used the word football since I was a professional player and this is the fifth country I’ve coached in.” He is only the second American to manage a Premier League team – in 2016 Bob Bradley was sacked by Swansea after 85 days – and is adamant his installation is not part of a “State-side takeover” orchestrated by the San Francisco 49ers, who hold a stake in Leeds. “To say there’s an Americanisation of this club would be inaccurate,” he said, pointing out that Andrea Radrizzani, the owner, is Italian, Angus Kinnear, the chief executive, British and Orta Spanish. “Where I’m from, Milwaukee in Wisconsin, reminds me a little bit of Leeds. My father worked on the assembly line in a tractor factory for 32 years. Working hard is what I know and this is hard-working city.” Marsch, mentored by the Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, and like Bielsa an advocate of aggressive pressing, revealed that the “vibe” never felt quite right during his ill-starred five-month stint as Julian Nagelsmann’s successor at Leipzig. “I’ve followed living legends everywhere I’ve been,” he said, somewhat wryly. In recent months Bielsa’s once gloriously attacking system has turned self-destructive, leaving Leeds conceding far too many goals and slipping towards the relegation zone. “The adjustment of tactics is my number one priority, getting away from the man-marking and not exposing us on transition as much,” said Marsch. “But this group is remarkable. It gives me big hope. “I used to have an equation: fear to fail equals failure. Our style of play is fearless, we have a lot of fearless young men here, we have to tap into that. My goal is to access their hearts and minds. I understand this is a big league and a big moment and we have to get points but pressure is what you make of it.” At least the stress in the treatment room is easing slightly with last season’s leading scorer, Patrick Bamford, and the England midfielder Kalvin Phillips close to returning from long spells on the sidelines. “The medical team have introduced me to a myriad of injuries,” said Marsch. “There’s been a cycle when guys played with injuries and picked up more injuries. I must not endanger or overload the guys. “Marcelo changed the mentality of the club and the team. I understand the things he did well but also that I don’t have to be Marcelo Bielsa.”",Sport/Football,Jesse Marsch says he was torn over succeeding Marcelo Bielsa at Leeds,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/03/jesse-marsch-says-he-was-torn-over-succeeding-marcelo-bielsa-at-leeds
3/4/2022,"The world has watched as France and Germany have seized superyachts to prevent their oligarch owners evading sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine. Yet – to the bemusement of allies – in Britain it is still legal for Russian-linked businessmen to sell their assets. MPs from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to Conservative party backbenchers lined up on Wednesday to ask Boris Johnson why the government has not yet personally targeted many of the individuals who have grown rich under Vladimir Putin. In private, EU governments are also trying to work out why the UK has been slow to act, and Frans Timmermans, the European Commission’s first vice-president on Thursday hinted at the frustrations in public. Johnson has promised to publish a list of people in Britain deemed to have links with Putin’s regime, while cabinet minister Michael Gove is reported to be in favour of seizing homes and offering them as housing to Ukrainian refugees. Yet for the moment, there is no sign of any further concrete action against the oligarchs. What are the reasons why the government may be dragging its feet? There is a persistent sense among anti-corruption experts that exposing dirty money flowing through the UK – and particularly through London – is not a high political priority. “Even without the invasion, with Russia I think this government has been caught on the back foot,” said Tom Keatinge, a financial crime expert at Rusi, a thinktank. “I just think it is something the prime minister has not ever thought he needed to focus on.” Whitehall sources stress there is now significant political will to change the UK’s status as a haven for oligarchs – including internal pressure from senior cabinet ministers. But the Conservative party will also be mindful of how it has benefited from Russian largesse – most recently £80,000 from Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of a former Putin minister. Chernukhin has denounced the invasion. Conservative party chair, Ben Elliot, runs a luxury concierge service whose marketing has offered to help Russians buy property in London and find elite private schools. Sanctions are a powerful weapon, but oligarchs can challenge them with expensive lawyers – at least, from those solicitors who can stomach reputational damage. Meanwhile billionaire oligarchs have a huge incentive to spend whatever necessary to have sanctions removed. “There’s not equality of arms,” said Bill Browder, a US financier turned anti-corruption campaigner. He describes UK law enforcement as risk averse. “In my experience over the last 10 years I’ve seen that the UK law enforcement capabilities when it comes to economic crime are at the bottom of the league table in this part of the world,” he said. The government has brought in “unexplained wealth orders” to force suspects to explain their wealth or else face confiscation, but has so far only used them against four people. One attempt ended in failure, with a court in 2020 rejecting an order against relatives of a former president of Kazakhstan. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said on Monday that the UK has a “hitlist” of oligarchs, and that the Foreign Office had hired extra lawyers and tripled the number of people in the sanctions department. But there is widespread internal frustration that preparatory work for legal cases against a number of individuals has only just now begun, after months of warning about a Russian invasion. Labour’s foreign affairs spokesperson, David Lammy, said: “It is totally unacceptable that a week after Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine just 11 oligarchs have faced sanctions by the UK government. Ministers had months to prepare for this eventuality, with the full support of parliament.” The Russian invasion has been the first new test of the sanctions regime since the UK left the EU. There is some evidence that the evidentiary standard the UK was applying was slightly higher than the EU. Government sources have blamed additional barriers brought in after a proposed amendment to sanctions law in 2018, by crossbench peer Lord Pannick, which they claim added an additional evidence burden. Support local charities There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Sunflower of Peace is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks.

It meant ministers had to apply a proportionality test and give individuals reasons why they had had sanctions placed on them. But Pannick told the Guardian there was little material difference with the EU regime, a view shared by other legal experts. The UK seems to be taking a more cautious legal approach regardless, which one Whitehall source put down to the newness of the system. Jasper Helder, a sanctions expert at Akin Gump, a US law firm, said: “The FCDO, they want to be careful that they have the appropriate evidence to support the correct application of designation authority.” Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, who has campaigned for tougher corruption laws, linked the slow action on sanctioning oligarchs to the UK allowing itself to “become a jurisdiction of choice for kleptocrats”. Hodge said she believed that the government had been swayed against tougher action by the City, anxious to avoid extra costs and, in some cases, lost business. Parts of the financial services sector are “not just colluding with but facilitating dirty money”, Hodge said. The broader services sector has also come under scrutiny. Henry Pryor, a buying agent and property expert, said: “We have historically made it too easy for people to own property without stepping into the sunshine.” ",News/Politics,Why does the UK seem so slow at acting against Putin’s oligarchs?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/03/putin-oligarchs-uk-slow-at-acting
3/4/2022,"The Kremlin has said it is not planning to institute martial law in Russia as rumours have spread that the government is preparing for a clampdown tied to its invasion of Ukraine. Thousands of Russians have begun fleeing the country amid unsourced reports that the borders could close as soon as this weekend after an extraordinary session of the Federation Council, Russia’s upper house of parliament, scheduled for Friday. The body often signs off on major foreign policy and security decisions and recently gave Putin the authority to use his military overseas before the invasion of Ukraine. “These are hoaxes,” said Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, in the first official reaction to suggestions that Russia could institute martial law. “These are nothing but hoaxes published on social networks, which citizens send to one another. One should be very careful about information and not to fall victim to rumours and fakes.” There have been no confirmed reports that the Kremlin is planning to introduce the regime, which could include border closures, military censorship and other measures to control and mobilise the country of 140 million in its conflict with the west. The rumours have been spread by some western officials, including a top Ukrainian presidential adviser, but no one in the Russian government. But the recent unpredictability of Vladimir Putin, who has begun a war of aggression with Ukraine that some predicted he would avoid, has spooked urban elites and set off a small-scale exodus from Russia’s major cities. “A lot of people are now writing that the purpose of this meeting is to adopt anti-crisis laws. But there is another possibility – the approval of martial law,” wrote Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder of the R.Politik political analysis firm. “Frankly speaking, without wanting to stir things up, I think this scenario is the more logical one.” Generally, the situation in Russia, which is under tremendous economic pressure from western sanctions, suggests a further crackdown and prolongation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “I think it’s going to get worse,” said Kadri Liik, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “For Putin, the incentive is to escalate. He has gone all in. I cannot see him modifying his war because that would be a loss in his eyes.” Any chance to come to an agreement with western powers had probably passed, she said. That appeared to be borne out by the result of Putin’s talks with Emmanuel Macron on Thursday. Putin told the French president that he was determined to press on with his attack “until the end,” according to an official in Macron’s office. Meanwhile, pro-Kremlin parties in the Duma presented a bill that would forcibly conscript opposition protesters to fight in Russia’s “special operation” in the Donbas region, the Russian longhand for its war in Ukraine. It was not immediately clear whether the bill, co-sponsored by the MP Andrei Lugovoi, the alleged poisoner of Russian FSB defector Alexander Litvinenko, would be met with a serious response. Other draft legislation, such as new penalties of 15 years in prison for “fakes” about the Russian army in Ukraine, appear more likely to pass. Thursday also brought a wave of news that Russia was increasingly sinking into international isolation, as western companies continued to abandon the market and local government increasingly clamped down to prevent money from fleeing the country. In a decision that will affect 15,000 workers, the furniture giant Ikea said it would halt its operations in Russia, stopping the import and export of goods and winding down its retail operation, prompting shoppers to flood to its store on the outskirts of Moscow. “The war has had a huge human impact already. It is also resulting in serious disruptions to supply chain and trading conditions,” the company said. “For all of these reasons, the company groups have decided to temporarily pause Ikea operations in Russia.” The grim economic prospects have already hit local businesses hard and prompted some entrepreneurs to flee the country. “There’s no future for our children here if Putin stays in power,” said the owner of an advertising services company with 100 employees. He was leaving for Armenia with his wife and two sons. “If Putin continues to control the country, it’s obvious for us that we don’t want to stay here, 100%. And we can only stay if he is overthrown. If there is a U-turn in politics, then we can stay.” The Kremlin has swiftly capitalised on the war to further dominate the information space, blocking key independent media outlets in moves that would normally lead to large protests. Echo of Moscow, a Russian independent news station that has broadcast uninterrupted since 1991, announced that it would dissolve on Thursday after refusing to comply with Russian censorship rules that require reporting on the war in Ukraine to only use official military and Kremlin sources. And TV Rain, the country’s top independent news television station, temporarily ended its broadcasts on Thursday after falling foul of similar rules.",News/World news,Kremlin denies planning to institute martial law in Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/kremlin-denies-planning-to-institute-martial-law-in-russia
3/4/2022,"International chess has moved swiftly to adjust to Russia’s war against Ukraine. Major events have switched venues or been postponed, Russian sponsors have been removed, while a former world title challenger has been shunned for his pro-invasion stance, with further penalties possible. India is the strongly favoured candidate to host the 150-nation Olympiad, the game’s flagship team event, after Moscow was stripped of the competition last week by Fide, the global chess body. The Indian chess scene is vibrant with talented young grandmasters in their teens or early 20s, inspired by the example of Vishy Anand, the world champion from 2007 to 2013. An official bid, with a guarantee of the previously announced $10m budget, was submitted to Fide this week. Whether Russia will be barred or allowed to compete under a neutral flag remains unclear. On Thursday, more than 30 leading Russian players signed an open letter to Vladimir Putin saying “Stop the War!” The letter’s most prominent signatories included Ian Nepomniachtchi, Alexandra Kosteniuk, Daniil Dubov, Peter Svidler, and Andrey Esipenko. Fide has taken a financial hit by its decision to terminate its backing from Russian state sponsors including the gas supplier Gazprom, the fertiliser giant PhosAgro, and the mining firm Nornickel. However, Nigel Short, who is effectively Fide’s acting president in current conditions, said that the organisation’s budget had expanded fivefold to over €13m since its new administration led by Arkady Dvorkovich took over in 2018, and that its current programmes would not be affected by the absence of Russian backing. Fide has also postponed the world team championship. scheduled for April in Jerusalem. Israel will still be the host for the new date in November. Ukraine have qualified to play, as have Poland, who have stated they would refuse to meet Russia, the defending champions, if they were allowed to compete. A more immediate question is the future of Sergey Karjakin. The 32-year-old was born in Crimea, and his early successes, all achieved as a Ukrainian, included becoming the youngest ever grandmaster at age 12, a record which stood for 19 years. He transferred to Russia, moved to Moscow in 2009, and long before the war was noted for his pro-Putin views. Karjakin has been referred to the Fide ethics and disciplinary commission for his statements supporting the invasion, which have been widely condemned. Norway’s annual tournament at Stavanger, which Karjakin has won twice and where he competed in 2021, has announced that he is no longer welcome and that other Russians will not be invited this year. The London Classic, where Karjakin took part in 2017, has followed suit. A critical question now is whether Karjakin will be allowed to take part in the eight-player Candidates tournament in Madrid in June, which will decide Magnus Carlsen’s next official challenger, and for which he qualified by finishing second in the 2021 Fide World Cup. Earlier, in 2016, Karjakin won the Candidates, and went on to score 6-6 on his world championship match with Magnus Carlsen in New York before losing the speed tie-break. It would be a controversial decision to bar Karjakin from the 2022 Candidates, but one of the severest punishments available to the Fide commission, which is due to report on the Muscovite’s case in a few weeks, is to: ban up to 15 years on taking part in chess competition … as a player … or representative of a chess federation. The commission’s chairman is a South African, and its members are from India, Nepal, and Guyana, with a non-voting US secretary. Ukraine, however, wants Fide and the European Chess Union to go further, much further. The Ukrainian Chess Federation president, Viktor Kapustin, asks for the immediate resignation of the Fide president, new Fide elections, and a blanket ban on Russians in all Fide competitions. Ukraine’s proposal will be considered at a meeting of the ECU in progress this week. Meanwhile, the second leg (of three) of the Fide Grand Prix, which will decide the final two Candidates spots, has begun in Belgrade. All five Russians are competing under a neutral flag, Alexander Grischuk, the senior member of the group, made a strong anti-war statement, but two losses at the start suggested he may be feeling the pressure. Grischuk’s wife, the world No 4 woman, Kateryna Lagno, is Ukrainian. There was too little time for the Russian quintet in Belgrade to be substituted, but it is still unclear whether they will be allowed to play in the final Grand Prix leg in Berlin later this month. Away from the war, the world champion, Magnus Carlsen, continued his winning streak, defeating both Covid and Nepomniachtchi en route to a 4.5-2.5 final victory in the online $150,000 Airthings Masters, the opening event of the 2022 $1.6m Meltwater Champions Tour. Just as in their classical world title match in Dubai, the Russian, who had tweeted his opposition to the war in Ukraine, held his own well for five games then collapsed at critical moments. Last week’s low-key international masters all-play-all organised by Tim Wall at the Ilkley Chess Centre, West Yorkshire, proved a significant success for two of England’s best young talents, who finished joint second on 5.5/9. Jonah Willow, 19, of Nottingham, is fast closing on the IM title. Willow is an active competitor both in English weekend opens and online in the weekly Titled Tuesday in which many world stars compete, and his hard work is paying off with good results. Even more striking was the performance of England’s youngest chess hope Shreyas Royal, 13, who was the lowest rated of the 10 starters yet finished the nine rounds unbeaten, missing what might have been the youngest ever English IM norm by just half a point. His Fide rating jumped 76 points. However, it was a Royal win that got away which provided the most bizarre moment of the tournament. At move 21, he missed a standard tactic which would have forced mate in three. At move 22, he missed a different mate in three which a novice would be expected to spot, and in the final position at move 23 where he agreed a draw he was still winning easily. Low budget all-play-alls like Ilkley, with well chosen participants, are arguably the best value for money events available for English chess at the moment, and deserve further support. 3805: 1 Qd4!

3/4/2022,"A leading business lobby group has called on British directors to resign from the boards of Russian companies to show solidarity with the people of Ukraine. The Institute of Directors said the war in Ukraine meant it was “untenable” for British directors to remain on the boards of Russian companies, adding that any directors of Belarusian firms should also quit. In a similar call, the IoD’s sister organisation, the European Confederation of Directors’ Associations, said all company bosses should go further and “reconsider their investment strategies as well as the operational processes in Russia and Belarus”. It said companies could not adopt a business-as-usual approach “when the war in Ukraine violates international rules”. Since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine last week, western governments and businesses have suspended trade with Russia and sanctioned Russian banks and several commercial businesses. Meanwhile, companies and their executive directors have come under intense pressure to review their relationships with Russian and Belarusian businesses. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has urged the Conservative peer and former minister Greg Barker to quit his lucrative role on the board of the Russian aluminium firm EN+, whose owners include the oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Barker, a climate change minister in David Cameron’s government, earned $4m (£3m) last year as executive chair of the firm, and was credited by chief executive Vladimir Kiryukhin with devising a plan to persuade US officials to lift sanctions levelled against the company and Deripaska in 2018. Wallace said: “He should quit,” adding, “I think Lord Barker should explain why he works with people like Deripaska.” Barker said: “Of course I completely understand and appreciate where people are coming from on this issue, but EN+ is a very international company with a big operation in Ukraine. Whatever the optics, the fact is I have a real responsibility for thousands of employees on the ground right now in Ukraine. I will not shirk that responsibility and walk away when there is fighting just miles from our plant there.” EN+ was unavailable for comment. Other prominent business people who sit on Russian boards are also likely to be singled out as the pressure to take a tough stance builds. Xavier Rolet, the former chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, sits on the board of Russian fertiliser giant PhosAgro as an independent director. The Frenchman, who was awarded the Order of Friendship of the Russian Federation in 2017, is among those expected to face calls to quit his role. Rolet was unavailable for comment. Jonathan Geldart, the IoD’s director general, said: “The Institute of Directors expresses its solidarity with Ukraine and its people, who are facing intolerable suffering. “Although directors owe legal duties to the companies on whose boards they serve, they should also feel a stronger moral duty to uphold the fundamental values of freedom and democracy. “We believe that it is no longer tenable for British directors to be involved in governance roles in the Russian economy. Therefore, we hope that they will now question the viability of their mandates in Russian and Belarusian companies,” he said. In a poll of its members and wider community, 86% said all British people should now resign their Russian board mandates, he added. London Stock Exchange boss David Schwimmer said the exchange had suspended trading in 28 Russian company listings on Thursday, including energy giants Rosneft and Gazprom as well as the country’s biggest lender Sberbank. The Russian billionaire Alexei Mordashov has resigned from the supervisory board of the world’s largest tourism operator, Tui, after he was personally hit by EU sanctions over his close links to the Putin administration. Mordashov, Russia’s richest man and the largest shareholder in Severstal, one of Russia‘s biggest steelmakers, was blacklisted by the EU on Monday. Several directors of Severstal, including two British nationals, Philip Dayer and Alun Bowen, have since resigned, the company said.",News/Business,Institute of Directors calls on Britons to quit Russian boards,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/03/institute-of-directors-calls-on-britons-to-quit-russian-boards
3/4/2022,"Melinda French Gates has addressed her divorce from Bill Gates publicly, saying that although she and the Microsoft co-founder are “friendly at this point”, she is not ready to label her relationship with Gates as “friends”. In a recent interview with CBS’s Gayle King, French Gates said multiple factors resulted in the couple’s high-profile divorce last May after 27 years of marriage. “It wasn’t one moment or one specific thing that happened. There just came a point in time where there was enough there that I realized it just wasn’t healthy. I couldn’t trust what we had,” the billionaire philanthropist said. French Gates revealed that she cried numerous times during her marriage, sometimes while lying on the floor. “How can I get up? How am I going to move?” she would ask herself, she said. “I gave every single piece of myself to this marriage. I was committed to this marriage on the day we got engaged and until the day I got out of it … but I also think society used to put things on women like it was our fault,” she said. “I did nothing wrong so I hold my head high.” In 2021, Gates acknowledged that he had an affair with a Microsoft employee, which Microsoft asked its board to investigate shortly before his resignation from the board in 2020. “There was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably,” said Gates’s spokesperson Bridgitt Arnold. Speaking about the affair, French Gates said she “certainly believe[s] in forgiveness, and so I thought we had worked through some of that”. When asked about one report that claimed Gates had multiple affairs, French Gates said: “You know, I think those are questions Bill needs to answer.” She said Bill Gates’s frequent meetings with financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein played a role in the divorce. She said: “I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein … I made that clear to him.” She added that she met Epstein once, because “I wanted to see who this man was and I regretted it from the second I stepped in the door”. “He was abhorrent, evil personified. I had nightmares about it afterwards,” French Gates said. Pressed about Gates’s continued meetings with Epstein despite her disapproval, she said: “Any of the questions remaining about Bill’s relationship … those are for Bill to answer.” French Gates said she will keep working with her former husband at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which they co-founded more than 20 years ago. “We certainly have a working relationship and I would say we’re friendly at this point,” she said. “Friends?” King asked. French Gates said: “Friends is a different word for me … that might come over time but for me there’s still healing that needs to happen.” She said that she is open to falling in love and dating again. “I hope that happens for me again. I’m dipping my toe in that water a little bit,” she said. Last month, French Gates announced she would no longer be channeling the majority of her wealth through the Gates Foundation, one of the world’s largest philanthropic organizations. “I think philanthropy is most effective when it prioritizes flexibility over ideology – and why in my work at the foundation and Pivotal Ventures I’ll continue to seek out new partners, ideas and perspectives,” French Gates wrote, referring to her investment and incubation company that she founded in 2015.",News/US news,Melinda French Gates says she is ‘friendly’ but not friends with Bill Gates,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/03/melinda-french-gates-friendly-bill-gates
3/4/2022,"Emmanuel Macron is expected to announce he is standing for re-election in a letter to be published in a number of local newspapers on Friday, according to French sources. The president, like all potential presidential candidates, has until 6pm local time to announce he will run in the April election and to present the country’s constitutional court with 500 signatures from MPs and other elected officials supporting his bid. Élysée sources told French media that Macron, who addressed the nation on Wednesday on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, what it meant for the EU and the probable consequences, wanted to avoid making a verbal declaration that might be seen as out of place in the international context of the war. A letter would be seen as sufficiently “solemn and sober”, a source told broadcaster France Info. It also allows him to explain why he is running for re-election through the regional press. While Macron’s handling of the Ukraine conflict and his telephone diplomacy with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has given him a boost in the polls, the timing of his re-election statement became time-sensitive. It was originally to be made around the opening of the prestigious Salon de l’Agriculture trade fair on 26 February, and a first campaign meeting was planned for Marseille this Saturday. Both were cancelled. Presidential advisers, who have been busy briefing journalists on the situation in Ukraine and France’s diplomatic efforts to stop Russia’s attempt to take over the country, have refused to make any comment on the presidential election timetable. Macron’s letter announcing he will stand again is expected to be published online on Thursday evening. Since he appeared from nowhere to win the presidential election in 2017, Macron’s five-year term at the Élysée Palace and political programme have been derailed first by the Covid-19 pandemic and now by Russia’s war on Ukraine. A recent poll suggested Macron was well ahead in the presidential race, with 28% of intentions to vote, compared with the far-right Rassemblement National’s Marine Le Pen in second place on 17%. The mainstream rightwing candidate Valérie Pécresse and hard-right candidate Éric Zemmour are close behind Le Pen.

3/4/2022,"Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea on Thursday via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol, as a large amphibious taskforce threatened Odesa to the west. With the Russian naval assault in the south spreading, a second merchant ship – the Estonian-owned carrier Helt – was hit and sunk after a Bangladeshi-owned cargo ship had been hit by a projectile that killed one of its crew. The ports, spread along hundreds of miles of Ukraine’s coastline, running from the Sea of Azov in the east to the Black Sea, have become an increased focus of attention for Russian forces in recent days – as it has become clear that the latest phase of the Russian invasion plan is seeking to cut off and isolate large sections of the country. Cutting Ukraine’s access to its coast would deal a crippling blow to the country’s economy and allow Russia to build a land corridor stretching from its border, across Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, and all the way west to Romania. Another key objective for Russian forces in the south east appeared to be Zaporizhzhia and its nuclear power plant in south-eastern Ukraine, Europe’s biggest, where Russian troops were trying to break through a barricade to the plant erected by local residents and territorial defence forces. The moves in the country’s south have come as Russia forces have attacked the country in three directions, seeking to stretch Ukraine’s armed forces and damage their ability to respond. In the latest threat to Ukraine’s coastline, residents told the Guardian they were stepping up preparations to defend it against a potential Russian marine landing, amid sightings of a convoy of Russian warships, and US warnings that an amphibious assault on Odesa – Ukraine’s biggest port – would be an economic catastrophe for Ukraine. Residents in the city told the Guardian of a marked increase in Russian airstrikes on Wednesday as images emerged of beaches close to the city laid with mines, and other defences being prepared. Concern surrounding a potential amphibious landing targeting Odesa mounted on Thursday following images of a Russian naval convoy showing at least eight ships visible off the coast. The convoy appears to include a number of 4,080 tonne Ropucha-class large landing ships and supporting vessels. The south has seen some of Russia’s biggest military gains during the week-old war so far, with the capture of Kherson, on the Dnieper river, opening the way for the assault on Odesa as well as for Russian forces to push north. Describing the fall of Kherson as representing a major strategic loss for Ukraine’s defenders, Michael Clarke of the Royal United Services Institute said Russian forces were attempting to build “a land bridge” across the southern territory which he suggested they would then ultimately attempt to link to the northern front around the capital Kyiv. “Kherson is very important because it is the city that controls the water supply to the Crimea,” said Clarke in an online briefing. “It’s also the city that’s key to crossing the Dnieper river. And at some point the Russians will want to be on both sides of the river to move up and join up with their northern front. Kherson is a big gain for [the Russians]. It’s taken them a while but they are here now.” From Kherson, regional governor Vitaliy Kim said that big convoys of Russian troops were advancing on Mykolaiv, another major Black Sea port and shipbuilding centre to the west. In Kherson itself, regional governor Hennadiy Lahuta conceded Russians were in the city but added that his staff had “not given up our duties”. A US defence official said it was too early to say whether Russian forces were in full control of Kherson. Kherson’s mayor, Ihor Kolykhaiev, said in a Facebook post early on Thursday that Russian troops were in control of the city hall and that residents should obey a curfew imposed by what he called the “armed visitors”. Kolykhaiev said he had made “no promises” to the Russian forces and that he was “only interested in the normal life of our city. I just asked [them] not to shoot people.” Reports also emerged from Mariupol that Russian forces were attempting to prevent civilians from evacuating, according to the mayor, Vadym Boichenko. Heavy fighting continued on the outskirts of Mariupol, with electricity and phone services largely cut, and homes and shops facing food and water shortages. Boichenko said in a video broadcast: “The invaders are systematically and methodically trying to blockade the city of Mariupol.” While Russia troops were advancing in the south, in the north of the country a war of attrition continued around the capital Kyiv where a massive Russian convoy to the north west, which earlier in the week had seemed poised to launch an assault on the capital, appeared stalled. “Kyiv withstood the night and another missile and bomb attack,” said the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “Our air defences worked,” he said. “Kherson, Izyum — all the other cities that the occupiers hit from the air did not give up anything.” In a video address to the nation early Thursday, Zelenskiy praised his country’s resistance. “We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy,” he said. “They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment.” He said the fighting is taking a toll on the morale of Russian soldiers, who “go into grocery stores and try to find something to eat”. “These are not warriors of a superpower,” he said. “These are confused children who have been used.” Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions heard overnight in the Ukrainian capital were Russian missiles being shot down by air defence systems.",News/World news,Kherson: Russian army moves to cut Ukraine’s access to sea,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/kherson-russian-army-moves-to-cut-ukraine-access-to-sea
