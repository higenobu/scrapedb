Barbara Kussow, Columbus I was the kid who never grew out of his animal phase. At the confluence of animals and conservation was Jack Hanna: genial, passionate, and spit-out-your-soda hysterical. Jack’s lack of bravado and pride made him accessible. He made anyone think they could follow their dreams. Growing up in Pittsburgh, it was my dream to be a zookeeper — to be close to animals and inspire people. This took me through high school (president of the environmentalist club), my very first job (Pittsburgh Zoo playground attendant), a zoology degree at The Ohio State University, and a seasonal (and eventually full-time) job at the Columbus Zoo on Jack’s team.

It didn’t matter to Jack – you were worth his time. He ate lunch with event staff, not sequestered in a green room by himself. He ensured the animals were well-cared for (they always were). He missed flights because he took extra time to make sure everyone got an autograph.

Hardy Kern, Columbus More can and must be done to address root causes of chronic absenteeism. Recent data from the Ohio Department of Education shows about 15% of schools reported half of their students chronically absent during the 2020-2021 school year. It’s hard for children to be academically successful when they’re not attending school regularly. So, why aren’t they at school? Research shows that 1 in 10 children miss more than 7 days of school due to illness or injury. More: Letters: Absenteeism in schools was a problem before the pandemic; it's worse now In fact, children with chronic health conditions or untreated medical needs, like asthma, tooth pain, or diabetes, are more likely to miss school. No parent wants to see their child suffer and for many, the lack of transportation, health coverage, or time off from work, can make access to health services nearly impossible. However, local examples exist of how communities have addressed these challenges: 100 school districts throughout Ohio provide school-based health care in partnership with parents, community providers, and local health systems; housing services where children are provided a clear pathway forward to re-engage students who have been disengaged in their learning due to health issues and ensure others do not fall off track. More: Ohio schools struggle with spikes in chronic absenteeism during pandemic It is a proven approach embraced by parents, health care providers, and local communities. For Ohio to successfully confront chronic absenteeism, expanding access to school-based health care services must be part of the solution.

2/25/2022,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that reaction from NATO and Western countries to Russia's assault on Ukraine had not been decisive, adding he hoped a NATO summit on Friday would lead to a more determined approach from the alliance. NATO member Turkey borders Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has good ties with both. It has called on Russia to end its attack and voiced support for Ukraine's territorial integrity. ""It should not turn into an ordinary flurry of condemnation. NATO should have taken a more decisive step,"" Erdogan said after Friday prayers in Istanbul. ""The EU and all Western mentalities did not show a seriously determined stance, they are all constantly advising Ukraine,"" he told reporters. ""It is not possible to get anywhere with advice. When you look at the steps taken, there are no steps taken."" Despite a wave of sanctions from the West on Russia, Turkey has said it opposes such moves. It has also avoided using words such as ""condemn"" in its reaction or ""invasion"" to describe what is happening, instead saying Moscow's attack was ""unacceptable"". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Europe on Friday to act more quickly and forcefully in imposing sanctions on Moscow for invading Ukraine, accusing western allies of politicking as Moscow's forces advanced on Kyiv. On Thursday, Ukraine asked Turkey to close the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits, linking the Mediterranean and Black sea, to Russia under a 1936 pact. But Ankara said on Friday it could not stop Russian vessels from going into the Black Sea as it had the right to return ships to their bases under the accord. While forging close cooperation with Russia on defence and energy, Turkey has also sold drones to Ukraine and signed a deal to co-produce more. Ankara also opposes Russian policies in Syria and Libya, as well as its annexation of Crimea in 2014. On Thursday, Erdogan, who previously offered to mediate the crisis, said he was ""sincerely saddened"" by Moscow's invasion, which he said was a ""heavy blow"" to regional peace.
