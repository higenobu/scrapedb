5/17/2022,"The Bank of England’s governor, Andrew Bailey, has blamed the war in Ukraine for the highest inflation in the UK for three decades and warned that “apocalyptic” food prices caused by Russia’s invasion could have a disastrous impact on the world’s poor. Giving evidence to MPs, Bailey said that while he was unhappy about the current level of price rises, 80% of the inflation overshoot was down to factors outside the Bank’s control. “I don’t feel at all happy and it’s a bad situation to be in,” the governor told the Treasury select committee as he was asked to explain why inflation stood at 7% – more than three times its official 2% target. “We have seen a series of supply shocks coming one after another and that’s unprecedented.” After weekend reports that unnamed cabinet ministers had questioned whether the Bank should remain independent, Bailey said: “This is the biggest test of the monetary policy framework in 25 years. There is no question about that.” Official figures due out later this week are expected to show the annual inflation rate rising above 9%, a level not seen since the early 1980s. Asked about the future risks to the cost of living, Bailey said there could be prolonged supply chain bottlenecks as a result of disruption in China or higher energy prices if Russia decided to cut off gas supplies. The governor said his concerns about food supplies had been heightened after speaking to Ukraine’s finance minister at last month’s IMF meeting in Washington. “He said he was optimistic about crop planting but at the moment there was no way of shipping the food out and it’s getting worse,” Bailey said. “That’s not just a major worry for this country but a worry for the developing world. I’m sorry for being apocalyptic but it is a worry.”",News/Business,"‘Apocalyptic’ food prices will be disastrous for world’s poor, says Bank governor",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/apocalyptic-food-prices-will-be-disastrous-for-worlds-poor-says-bank-governor
5/17/2022,"He is an outspoken political maverick who has upended British politics by yanking a mainstream party towards a radical position that has reverberated across Europe. But his name is not Nigel Farage. Jim Allister is leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice, a one-man band with a simple message that has ensnared Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and by extension the UK government and European Commission. Few outside Northern Ireland have heard of him but Allister has emulated the Ukip strategy of harnessing elements of a dominant party to push a militant agenda. The results were on display on Monday when Boris Johnson flew into Belfast to try to defuse a crisis that has collapsed the devolved government and escalated the row between Downing Street and Brussels over the Northern Ireland protocol. The spectacle of the prime minister trying to revive the Stormont assembly and renegotiate a Brexit deal he had once declared “oven-ready” was, depending on perspective, a tribute to or an indictment of Allister. The 69-year-old barrister and North Antrim legislative assembly member has forcefully denounced the protocol from its inception in 2019 and tugged the DUP in his wake, culminating in its decision last week to block the formation of an assembly and executive at Stormont. “His implacable opposition to the protocol has been important in moving the DUP’s position from moderate opposition to the current position where they refuse to go into the assembly,” said Duncan Morrow, an Ulster University politics professor. “Jim is very unique. He reaches certain elements of the DUP’s own coalition so they’re always very nervous about him.” To critics Allister is a dinosaur who whips up Protestant anxieties and undermines reconciliation with claims that Northern Ireland risks sliding out of the UK into a united Ireland beholden to the IRA. To supporters he is a leader of vision and integrity who sounded the alarm on genuine constitutional peril. “We’re under control by Europe. We feel we’re no longer part of the UK,” said Sam Little, a dairy farmer who attended a recent anti-protocol rally. Even detractors concede Allister’s gravel-voiced eloquence tilted a debate about trade rules into an existential challenge for unionism. On rally platforms and on radio shows he rammed home the message that post-Brexit checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain were a “dagger” into the heart of the union. “He drilled into the constitutional question about Brussels setting regulations in the future,” said Peter Shirlow, director at the University of Liverpool’s Institute of Irish Studies. “He’s the man who finds the raw nerve and when he finds it he pokes it.” Allister joined the DUP in 1971 but broke with Ian Paisley over an electoral pact with other unionists in 1987. He rejoined the DUP and was elected an MEP but quit the party again when Paisley entered government with Sinn Féin in 2007. With all the main parties co-opted into power sharing Allister has often been a lone opposition voice at Stormont. He did not respond to an interview request for this article. The DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, might have sold a concession on the protocol last year to his party were it not for Allister shouting from the sidelines, said Shirlow. “He’s like Farage in that sense, very good at that simple messaging.” When the TUV soared in opinion polls, siphoning support from the DUP, the Democratic Unionists took fright and hardened their position, at the cost of alienating moderates. The party collapsed the power-sharing executive in January and said it would not form another one without major changes to the protocol. Despite this attempt to steal TUV thunder, Allister’s party still won 7.6% of the first preference vote in the assembly election. A quirk of the voting system meant Allister was the only member of the TUV to win a seat – in contrast to the Alliance party, which won 17 seats with 13.5% of first preferences. The DUP remained focused on its rightwing rival, said one party insider. “That’s where the energy in unionism is.”",News/UK news,‘He’s like Farage’: how Jim Allister fired up opposition to NI protocol,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/hes-like-farage-jim-allister-fired-up-opposition-ni-protocol
5/17/2022,"Ukraine’s Kalush Orchestra gave an impromptu rendition of their Eurovision-winning song, Stefania, at the Polish border as they made their way home on Monday. The band, whose music blends traditional folk and hip-hop, were presented with blue and yellow flowers as they were greeted at the border by servicemen and women, before breaking into song. Stefania had been among the favourites to win the Eurovision song contest in the northern Italian city of Turin, but decisive victory came from the public, with 439 points from the public vote putting the band in first place among the 25 finalists. The song, which includes the lyrics: “I’ll always find my way home, even if all roads are destroyed”, was written by frontman Oleh Psiuk as a tribute to his mother, before finding new resonance among Ukrainians as it became an anthem in their war-torn country. In an interview on Italian TV on Sunday night, Psiuk, who turned 28 on Monday, became emotional when talking about his mother: “She stayed up until 3am to cheer us on,” he said. “In our city, Kalush, the sirens go off four times a day, nothing like in other places.” Kalush Orchestra, a six-person band, was given special permission to travel to the 66th Eurovision song contest – they travelled by land to Poland, before flying from there to Turin – although one band member stayed in Ukraine to fight. Psiuk said when they got home they would take off their stage outfits and wear the uniform of the Ukrainian resistance. “Like every Ukrainian, we are ready to fight for however long is necessary,” he added. He made a plea for next year’s Eurovision song contest to be hosted in the besieged city of Mariupol.",Arts/Television & radio,Eurovision winners sing at Polish border on way back to Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/16/eurovision-winners-sing-at-polish-border-on-way-back-to-ukraine

5/17/2022,"Melania Trump has refused to rule out a second term as first lady, should her husband capture the White House again. “Never say never,” she said. Donald Trump has strongly hinted he will try to take back the presidency he lost to Joe Biden but he has not formally announced a campaign. The former president remains in legal jeopardy over his attempt to overturn his election defeat, and his business affairs. The adult film producer and actor Stormy Daniels is among those who claim affairs with Donald Trump after he married Melania, which the Republican former president denies, but despite persistent rumours of an unhappy marriage made unhappier by the presidency, his third wife has stayed by his side. “I like Washington DC,” Melania Trump told Fox News at Mar-a-Lago in Florida in her first formal interview since her husband left office in January 2021. “I know it operates completely different than any other city. But I really liked it there and I really enjoyed living in the White House. To be the first lady of the United States was my greatest honour, and I think we achieved a lot in the four years of the Trump administration. “I enjoyed taking care of the White House. It was my home for a while. I understood it is a people’s house. It was a privilege to live there.” Her interviewer, Pete Hegseth, said: “And maybe it’ll be your home again?” “Never say never,” Trump said. Asked about “the state of the country right now”, Trump said: “I think it’s sad to see what’s going on if you really look deep into it. I think a lot of people are struggling and suffering.” Asked about the crisis over supplies of baby formula, one of many dogging the Biden administration, Trump said it was “heartbreaking to see that they are struggling and the food is not available for children in 21st century in United States of America”. The Slovenian-born first lady ascribed the crisis to a lack of “leadership” in the White House. “I know that Covid brought another struggles to the people who were having problems before. But what’s going on is unthinkable. A lot of people are dying from drugs and it’s very hard to see,” she added, referring to record US overdose levels. Asked about media hostility, Trump said: “People I see always criticise me whatever I do and I’m used to that. I move forward and I’m here to helping people and that is the mission. And those people who criticise me, I would encourage them to help in their own community or maybe join my Foster the Future initiative.” In fact called Fostering the Future, the initiative to help children in foster care is an outgrowth of Be Best, which aimed in part to help children subject to bullying. Critics noted the irony of the-then first lady being married to a man who made bullying and harsh invective the core of his public persona. Melania also discussed her sale of NFTs, digital artworks, inspired by her time in the White House, “some of the proceeds” of which she said would go to helping children in foster care. In February, Bloomberg reported that Trump herself was behind the purchase for about $180,000 of one such artwork. She said “the transaction was facilitated on behalf of a third-party buyer”. On Fox News, Trump, a former model, was also asked about a perceived snub by Vogue magazine, which has featured Jill Biden and the vice-president, Kamala Harris, on its cover but which, despite her “business background and … fashion background and … beauty” did not accord that honour to Trump while she was first lady. “They’re biased and they have likes and dislikes,” Trump said, “and it’s so obvious. And I think American people and everyone see it. It was their decision, and I have much more important things to do, and I did in the White House, than being on the cover of Vogue.” Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former friend and aide who wrote a tell-all memoir, has said Trump was offered a Vogue shoot but turned it down because the magazine would not guarantee her the cover.",News/US news,‘Never say never’: Melania Trump does not rule out second White House term,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/melania-trump-white-house-second-term
5/17/2022,"“There are times when you doubt your heart can hold up; you get the feeling they’re trying to scare you to death,” Javier Aguirre said, and he didn’t even know the half of it. It was wild enough just where he was: “inexplicable,” “liberation,” “magic,” in the words of the man who had made it happen. The bench emptied on to the pitch, fans tumbled down the stands, arms were everywhere. Over 91 minutes had gone in the penultimate game of the season when the ball dropped to Abdón Prats and he scored the goal that pulled Real Mallorca from the relegation zone, their destiny back in their own hands at the last. “That’s the good news,” Aguirre said; it was the only news the Mallorca manager had wanted to hear all day, at least until it was over. On a weekend when nine games were played at the same time, fates decided on faraway fields, a series of interconnected stories unfolding together and each more powerful because of the others, in which his team were one of a handful who could still go down, he decided that he didn’t want his players to know what was going on elsewhere. He didn’t want to know himself, either. “It’s a bloody mess,” he claimed. “You can’t manage your own issues, let alone everything else that’s happening.” Everything else that’s happening was, he would later find out, a lot – although not quite like what went down at Son Moix, survival suddenly possible at the point when hope seemed to have slipped the net. At the end of Mallorca’s 2-1 injury-time win over Rayo Vallecano, Aguirre dashed straight down the tunnel. He had been busting for a pee, he admitted – “I am 63” – and by the time he did his first post-game interview, he still didn’t know all the other scores, asking the reporter: “Are Granada still in the equation?” “Yes, they’re one, no two points off relegation,” she replied, actually right the first time. “Ah, I had no idea, that’s good news you bring,” the Mallorca coach said. “So there would be three of us.” At the start of the day, there had been five. By the end, one had gone at each end: a 0-0 draw against Barcelona meant Getafe were mathematically safe, while Alavés’s defeat at Levante sent them down to segunda, leaving Mallorca, Cádiz and, yes, Granada to fight to avoid the final relegation place next week. Sevilla reached their third consecutive Champions League after Youssef En-Nesyri’s 85th minute goal gave them the point they needed at Atlético, and Real Sociedad qualified for Europe three years running after they defeated Villarreal. It wasn’t supposed to be this way, and very nearly wasn’t. Alavés, on 32 points at kick off (counting the point from the draw the games start with) were at newly-relegated Levante. Mallorca, on 34, faced Rayo Vallecano. Above them, Cádiz, starting on 36, played Real Madrid at home. And Granada, on 38, were at Betis. It took just five minutes for the scores to start moving. It was hard to keep up, hard even to calculate after event, but it went something like this: First Mariano Díaz put Real Madrid one-up at Cádiz, then Vedat Muriqi gave Mallorca the lead against Rayo, and next, Juanmi scored for Betis against Granada, meaning that 291km away Cádiz replaced Mallorca in the relegation zone. Then Joselu scored for Alavés, putting them on course for a win at Levante and leaving just three points between themselves, Cádiz, Mallorca and Granada. And the next minute, Rubén Sobrino equalised for Cádiz against Madrid. At half-time Cádiz were level on points with Mallorca (but still behind on head to head), the table reading: Alavés 34, Cádiz 36, Mallorca 36, Granada 37. Everyone was a goal away from everything turning again. Early in the second half, Óscar Duarte scored for Levante. Alavés dropped to 32 points, safety out of reach, and it got even worse: Roger Martí would add a second for Levante on 74 minutes and José Luis Morales a third on 95 to put Alavés bottom and down, five points adrift. Then in Palma, where Aguirre’s inhibited team were struggling, Pathé Ciss scored for Rayo meaning Mallorca slipped into the relegation zone. Worse, Cádiz were about to take a four-point lead that would leave Mallorca down there for good, when they won a penalty a minute later. Álvaro Negredo would take it, survival in sight. But Andriy Lunin – the Madrid backup goalkeeper that Cádiz coach Sergio hadn’t played when he was on loan at Valladolid – produced a superb save. At 2-1 down 15 minutes later, Alavés were slipping sadly away. “We don’t deserve to be in this division,” Joselu said later, speaking for everyone except him, responsible for almost half their goals. In Cádiz, the home side kept going, racking up 21 shots but not getting a winner. “It’s hard to do more against a team like Madrid,” Sergio said, and yet at least their fate still remained in their own hands at that point: they would go to Alavés on the final day knowing a win would be enough. In Seville, Granada had hit the post against Betis, but couldn’t get the goal that would have made them mathematically safe, then conceding again in the 88th minute. In Palma, Mallorca still hadn’t scored. And then, on 90.20 Mallorca thought they had the goal that would change everything. They won a free-kick just outside the area, cameras closing in on a small boy who couldn’t watch, chewing on his finger nails. Kang-in Lee bent the ball past the wall and off the bar. From the other side of the ground, it looked in, some leaping up, the cheers dying in their throats. Then, 49 seconds later, they were given another chance. Prats controlled a deep cross and squeezed the finish into the far corner. 👹 @RCD_Mallorca move out of the relegation zone before the final matchday in #LaLigaSantander!#RCDMallorcaRayo pic.twitter.com/RiHkOpRUUY It had to be him, owner of the most magnificent moustache in Spain: Mallorca-born, a Mallorca fan and youth-team product, a man who made his debut a decade ago, who has had three spells in the first team, starting the latest in the regionalised, 80-team Segunda B and winning back-to-back promotions to primera. The man who got the 82nd-minute goal that took them there in the playoff final against Deportivo; who has lived three promotions, three relegations and doesn’t want to live any more of them. Who vowed to “cling on tight to Son Bibiloni”, the training ground, and “never leave”. Who a month ago told Aguirre: “Count on me: you won’t regret it” and immediately scored against Alavés to give them hope. “He’s from here and you can tell: he feels Mallorca,” his manager said. At that moment, they all did, the place erupting. “Yes we can,” they chanted. Mallorca were out of the relegation zone after half an hour in there but they knew they could still be dragged back in. On 94.04, Rayo forward Mamadou Sylla missed a huge chance, an entire stadium holding their breath, and even the final whistle didn’t end the agony. In the stands, radios were turned up. On the touchline, players gathered round someone’s phone, watching. Granada were beaten, Alavés too, but in Cádiz it wasn’t over. On 96.25, Dani Carvajal jumped in on Fali inside the area, and referee Mateu Lahoz grabbed the ball and put a finger to his ear. Everyone stopped. Not for the first time, no one knew what he was doing. In the VAR room they were looking at something. Might this even be a penalty? No. It took a while, but eventually he kicked the ball to towards the tunnel and invited them to follow. Silence there, cheers in Mallorca. A Bilbao 2-0 Osasuna, Atlético Madrid 1-1 Sevilla, Cádiz 1-1 Real Madrid, Celta Vigo 1-0 Elche, Getafe 0-0 Barcelona, Levante 3-1 Alavés, Mallorca 2-1 Rayo Vallecano, Real Betis 2-0 Granada, Villarreal 1-2 Real Sociedad, Espanyol 1-1 Valencia  “I play with my hand on my heart and I’m so happy to write history at my club, my home. I came here to watch my idols when I was little, and it’s very special to be able to live these wonderful years with Mallorca, watching the club grow,” Prats said. “This will go down in history and I hope it can help us survive on the last day.” Next Sunday, there will be no going back. Cádiz, on 36 points go to Alavés, who have been denied their one last shot at survival in front of their fans. Mallorca, also on 36, go to Osasuna, where Javier Aguirre is a hero, the man who took them to the Champions League 17 years ago now. Granada, on 37, play Espanyol, a situation their coach, Aitor Karanka, admitted they would have signed up for a month ago but they’re still in the equation despite their revival. So are Mallorca, destiny unexpectedly in their control, no need for the radio or a calculator, just a lifeline to hold on to and the support of their own. “At moments like this I think of all those of us who suffer with Mallorca. I have faith in this team,” Prats said. “I’m calling on the fans to come to Pamplona. I’ll speak to their bosses to make sure they get the Monday off work.”",Sport/Football,Silence and cheers as ‘inexplicable magic’ brings Mallorca back from brink | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/silence-and-cheers-mallorca-back-from-brink-after-inexplicable-magic
5/17/2022,"On Last Week Tonight, John Oliver tore into the utility companies that have near-monopolistic control over the US power grid, which set high prices and are prone to scandal. “Just Google your utility company right now and the word ‘scandal’, and chances are they’ve gotten into some major trouble,” he said on Sunday evening. “It’s basically like Googling your local Jimmy John’s and E coli, or the name of your favorite teacher from high school and January 6. You’re not going to like the results that you find.” Perhaps the deadliest scandal of recent years was Pacific Gas & Electric in California, whose neglect of crumbling infrastructure led to the 2018 Camp fire, the largest wildfire in state history. The company has faced billions of dollars in fines, but continues to operate. “And if you’re thinking, how the fuck is that possible, that is what this story is about,” Oliver explained. “It’s about the incredible amount of power that we give to utilities, how weakly they can be regulated, and the damage they can do.” The “single most important thing to know” about utilities, he began, is that “for most of us, they’re the only game in town”. The patchwork of companies around the company act essentially as monopolies, dating back to the construction of the US power grid in the early 20th century; the government incentivized companies to participate in such a huge investment by promising a non-competitive environment. The law imposed some restrictions – companies are supposed to spend the least they can while providing quality, environmentally safe service. “Which sounds great, because it caps their ability to make too much money,” Oliver said. “But, and this is a huge but, there is a carve-out. Because when they build something – a piece of physical infrastructure – they’re allowed to then pass along that cost to you through your bill, plus an additional percentage that they get to keep as profit” that’s usually about 10%. “This creates a clear incentive: the bigger the project, like a power plant, the more profit they make. “In the best-case scenario, this might mean that utilities are investing in infrastructure that is badly needed,” he continued. “The problem is, they can also be shameless in increasing spending even when it is not needed or on projects that are actively falling apart.” In theory, a state’s public utility commission is supposed to keep a check on utility companies by signing off on proposals and overseeing the setting of rates. “Unfortunately, many of them are badly outmatched by the utilities that they’re supposed to regulate,” Oliver explained, pointing to Mississippi, where the commission approved a plant by Mississippi Power that was only 10-15% designed. (Costs ballooned from a projected $1.8bn to $7.5bn.) “The plant was only 10-15% designed, and the commission let it go ahead anyway?” Oliver exclaimed. “That is not how designing complex energy plants should work. That’s not even how designing Lego sets work. That’s why you’ve never seen one called ‘A Little Tree and You Figure Out the Rest’.” Basically, he recapped, “our utility system largely consists of for-profit companies, with monopolies over an essential service, building as much shit as they possibly can so that they can pass the cost onto you on your electric bill”. To illustrate, Oliver returned to the example of PG&E. “You can see why Californians hate PG&E so much,” he said. “In just one three-year time span, it was responsible for around 1,500 fires. That’s an average of more than one fire a day. And at that point, PG&E are less a utility and more a fire company that occasionally also delivers power to people’s homes.” Oliver boiled down the issue to profit incentives: the company makes money through new infrastructure, not maintaining it or the area around it. The worn-down hook that broke and started the Camp fire was 97 years old; others found near it were also on the brink of malfunction from decades of use. “And it’s not like PG&E didn’t have the money to perform basic maintenance,” he added – in the five years before the Camp fire, the company issued $5.1bn in dividends to shareholders. “Clearly this isn’t a system where you, the customer, are going to be prioritized,” he concluded. “If anything, the model only makes sense if the companies’ shareholders are viewed as the customer and your bills are the product.” Oliver called for performance-based regulation – incentivizing companies to work in the public interest by investing in maintenance, renewables and energy conservation – and for providing regulators with more support, access to technical expertise and more jurisdiction over the companies they monitor. “At this point, I would usually bring out a mascot that we’ve made for utilities that’s representative of just how terrible and horrifying they are,” he added, “but amazingly, I don’t even need to do that. Because they already made a murderous hell demon almost 100 years ago.” And with that, he rebooted Reddy Kilowatt, an early 20th-century industry mascot “too good at representing how shitty utility companies are”.",Arts/Television & radio,John Oliver on the power of US utility companies: ‘The only game in town’,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/16/john-oliver-us-utility-companies-last-week-tonight-recap
5/17/2022,"E-cigarettes are as safe to use as nicotine patches for pregnant smokers trying to quit, and may be a more effective tool, researchers have revealed. Smoking in pregnancy can increase the risk of outcomes including premature birth, miscarriage and the baby having a low birth weight. But stubbing out the habit can be a struggle. “Many pregnant smokers find it difficult to quit with current stop smoking medications including nicotine patches and continue to smoke throughout pregnancy,” said Dr Francesca Pesola, an author of the new study who is based at Queen Mary University in London. While e-cigarettes have been found to be more effective than nicotine patches in helping people quit, Pesola noted there has been little research into their effectiveness or safety among pregnant women, despite an increase in use by expectant mothers. Writing in the journal Nature Medicine, Pesola and colleagues describe how they randomly assigned 569 pregnant smokers to use e-cigarettes and 571 to use nicotine patches – a form of nicotine replacement therapy that can already be prescribed by during pregnancy. The participants were, on average, 15.7 weeks pregnant and smoked 10 cigarettes a day. Only 40% of those given e-cigarettes and 23% of those given patches used their allocated product for at least four weeks. However, both uptake and duration of use during the study was higher among those given e-cigarettes. After excluding participants who self-reported not smoking but who used nicotine products other than those allocated to them – for example those given patches group who used e-cigarettes – the team found those given e-cigarettes appeared to do better at quitting smoking. Four weeks into their attempt to quit 15.4% of those given e-cigarettes self-reported they were not smoking, compared with 8.6% of those given patches, while 19.8% of the e-cigarette group self-reported abstinence at the end of pregnancy compared with 9.7% in the group given patches. Only a small number of participants provided saliva samples to confirm smoking abstinence at the end of pregnancy, but once those who used non-allocated products were excluded, the team found higher rates of abstinence among the e-cigarette group. In addition the team found the rates of adverse events were similar between those given cigarettes and those given patches. What’s more, while the average birth weight of the babies was similar, low birth weights were more common in the patch group. However the study has limitations, including low adherence and that the e-cigarettes used in the study differ from modern pod devices. The authors add that given questions remain about the potential risks of nicotine in pregnancy, it is preferable for pregnant women to quit smoking without using nicotine containing products. “We would only recommend the use of nicotine to smokers wanting to quit their regular cigarettes,” said Pesola. But, she added: “Using an e-cigarette poses no greater risk to the mother or baby than nicotine patches, which are both better options than continuing to smoke throughout pregnancy.”",News/Society,E-cigarettes ‘as safe as nicotine patches’ for pregnant smokers trying to quit,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/16/e-cigarettes-as-safe-as-nicotine-patches-for-pregnant-smokers-trying-to-quit
5/17/2022,"It was always going to happen one day, and on Saturday afternoon the moment finally arrived. A little less than 10 years after Frankel completed a 14-race unbeaten career in October 2012, Baaeed’s name was dropped into the same sentence as Sir Henry Cecil’s great champion, following his breathtaking success in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury. It went little further than a general acknowledgement that Baaeed may be the “best since” Frankel, on a British racecourse at least, while Angus Gold, racing manager for the Shadwell operation which owns the four-year-old, cautiously suggested to the Racing Post that he was “‘not going to say he’s in that class yet because Frankel is the best I’ve ever seen, although he’s heading in that direction.” But for as long as Baaeed keeps winning – and on the evidence of Saturday there is nothing among the older horses at least that can give him a serious race – the comparisons will continue, not least because his route through the season could well be a near-facsimile of Frankel’s four-year-old campaign. Next up for the unbeaten winner of seven races is the Queen Anne Stakes, the first race at the Royal meeting next month, in which Frankel produced the greatest performance of his career a decade ago. William Haggas will also look to step him up to a mile-and-a-quarter later in the season, probably in the International Stakes at York in August, in which, as the trainer pointed out on Saturday, Frankel was “arguably … at his most imperious” in 2012.

The dream that one day they might breed the perfect, unbeatable racehorse has kept owners and breeders in the Flat racing game for centuries, and for a great deal longer than there have been geneticists around, to explain why their quest is all but certain to end in disappointment. Most of the truly great horses of recent decades have endured at least one defeat. Timeform has awarded a rating of 140 or above to 13 horses since 1948, and just two – Frankel and Ribot – went through their entire careers unbeaten. Sea-Bird II, Brigadier Gerard, Mill Reef, Dancing Brave, Sea The Stars (the sire of Baeed), Shergar and Dubai Millennium are among the 11 who did not. None of those great horses were diminished by defeat. Brigadier Gerard was unbeaten in 15 starts when Roberto beat him at York in 1972, while Sea The Stars’ only reverse came on his two-year-old debut. But at the same time, the fact that Baaeed is still unbeaten after seven trips to the track can only add to the buzz and anticipation as his four-year-old season unfolds. As yet, he can only be one of the best of recent years, and not recent decades, and his revised Timeform mark of 134 is nearly a stone adrift of Frankel (147). The best Flat horse in living memory was also notable for his extraordinary ability to produce 140+ performances time and time again, something that Baaeed will surely find impossible to match in the limited time available. Frankie Dettori has been booked to ride Piz Badile for trainer Donnacha O’Brien in the Derby at Epsom next month, when the veteran jockey will be hoping to win the Classic for the third time. Piz Badile has not had a race since battling back to edge out Buckaroo in the Group Three Ballysax Stakes at Leopardstown in early April, having been headed inside the final furlong. O’Brien, whose father, Aidan, has won the Derby a record eight times, decided to steer Piz Badile around the Derby Trial at Leopardstown earlier this month in order to arrive at Epsom with a fresh horse. Despite his six-week absence, however, the son of Ulysses has maintained a prominent position in the ante-post betting at around 9-1 and the news that Dettori will be in his saddle next month is likely to see him shrink further in the market. “The horse is in good form,” Alan Cooper, racing manager for the Niarchos family, which owns Piz Badile, said. “We’ve got just under three weeks to go, so hopefully he stays in good form between now and then. I think Donnacha is very happy with his horse and the decision was made not to go to the Derby Trial, which would have been the horse’s third trip to Leopardstown. They all need luck in running and we’ll go from there.” Desert Crown, an impressive winner of the Dante Stakesat York on Thursday, heads the Derby market at 2-1 with Aidan O’Brien’s Stone Age, who took the Leopardstown trial, next in the list on 3-1. O’Brien’s bid to win a ninth Derby is likely to be strengthened by Changingoftheguard (8-1), United Nations (14-1) and Star Of India (16-1), while Charlie Appleby’s Walk Of Stars, who was second to United Nations in the Lingfield Derby Trial, is a 16-1 chance. A relatively late start to his racing career also means that Haggas’s colt never got the chance to get a Classic or juvenile Group victory on his CV. These are just a few of the reasons why any mention of Frankel set the bar at a height that Baaeed cannot clear. None of us, after all, can reasonably expect to see two horses of Frankel’s quality in a single lifetime. But you can always hope, as generations of owners, breeders and fans have done for centuries. For as long as Baaeed has that air of “invincibility” about him, the comparisons will keep on coming.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Unbeaten Baaeed’s run draws comparison with Frankel,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/16/talking-horses-unbeaten-baaeeds-run-draws-comparison-with-frankel
5/17/2022,"A man who stalked women in the woods has been found guilty of bludgeoning a police community support officer to death. Callum Wheeler chased and ambushed Julia James, 53, with a 3kg metal railway jack as she walked her dog near her home in Snowdown, Kent, in April last year. The 22-year-old, an unemployed school dropout, was convicted of murder after a six-day trial at Canterbury crown court. Officers from Kent police paid tribute to James, a “dedicated and devoted” police community support officer, who joined the force in 2008 and worked with victims of domestic abuse. Deputy chief constable Tim Smith said the case was “extremely poignant”, adding: “Many of our staff knew Julia intimately and as a friend. The impact on us has been far more profound than any other murder in the county. Julia was very much loved and known by staff of all ranks and roles. “There is a very personal impact on us as a force … This is quite different for us to deal with and investigate because of Julia’s legacy. We miss her greatly.” In her closing speech on Monday, the prosecutor, Alison Morgan QC, described Wheeler as “an angry, violent, strange, highly sexualised man” who waited in Ackholt Wood in Snowdown for “a lone female” to attack. “There is no mental health defence available to him,” she said. But the defence barrister, Oliver Blunt QC, drew the jury’s attention to the “oddity” of Wheeler’s behaviour and questioned whether he had the “requisite intent” to kill. The court heard James had twice spotted Wheeler lurking in the woods in the months before the murder, telling her husband, Paul, that she had passed “a really weird dude”. In February 2021 the couple saw him loitering in the same place. Several witnesses also spotted Wheeler acting suspiciously in the area in the days leading up to the brutal attack on 27 April last year. In that same period, Wheeler visited pornographic websites 42 times and searched the word “raped”. After his arrest on 7 May 2021, he exposed himself to female police officers and tried to masturbate in front of them before asking to be “spanked”. He also told custody staff that if he was released he would rape and kill women because they deserved to die. He said: “You can’t go into the woods and expect to be safe.” He added that he would go back to the scene of his crime and “have sex with women without their consent”. James, a mother of two, had been walking her jack russell, Toby, to an area of Ackholt Wood she knew as “butterfly corner” when she spotted Wheeler in the same spot as before. Her Apple smartwatch revealed how her heart rate and pace increased dramatically and she suddenly changed direction as she ran for her life. But Wheeler chased her down and struck her over the head with a railway jack. She fell face down on the ground and broke her wrist as Wheeler repeatedly struck her over the head, inflicting what a pathologist described as “unsurvivable injuries”. There was no evidence of a sustained or violent sexual assault, the court heard. But the prosecutor questioned why Wheeler’s DNA had been found near the breast area of a vest James wore under a grey jumper and coat. The level of violence and random nature of the attack led police to believe Wheeler may have killed again. He spent the days after the murder roaming around the area with the murder weapon – a 97cm-long cylindrical bar used to lift train tracks – protruding from his bag. It was later found propped up against a wall in his bedroom. The senior investigating officer, Det Supt Gavin Moss, said: “I can never say what was going on in his mind, but the level of [police] resources used was justified because we cannot know that he wouldn’t have done it again.” Born in Southwark in February 2000, Wheeler is the youngest of three sons. He has a history of mental health problems – but none that were deemed relevant to the case – and dropped out of school at 15, failing to achieve GCSEs. He moved to Aylesham, Kent, with his father and younger brother about two years ago after his parents separated. Police described Wheeler, who has no previous convictions or cautions, as an “absolute loner” who did not even have a relationship with the brother he lived with. Moss said: “Wheeler wasn’t studying. He wasn’t working. I would describe him as a complete and utter loner … This was somebody who had a life that existed of absolutely nothing. He’d spend most of his time watching TV in his bedroom. “He had no friends. Normally we’re able to explore about associates [but] even his mobile telephone had very few contacts so we knew very little about him.”",News/UK news,Julia James killing: man found guilty of murdering PCSO in Kent,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/julia-james-killing-man-found-guilty-of-bludgeoning-pcso-to-death
5/17/2022,"What can the Eurovision song contest teach us about the human condition? Some years, not much except that we like shiny things; this year, that we all thirst for justice, support the victim against the aggressor, are overwhelmed by the sight of love and courage – and therefore, Ukraine was bound to win. In fact, if winning were all that mattered, it would have been quicker for the rest of Europe to not turn up. But (another lesson) winning is not all that matters. It’s horribly poignant to recall that last year we were mainly complaining about peace, as a song topic. “Not more bloody harmony,” we cavilled, as we patiently waited for the next Nordic duo, close harmonising and asking, “Why war?” “Enough international love already!” Ah, the hollow cynicism of peacetime. Wouldn’t it be great to be hollow and cynical again, and not have to take a song’s metaphors about a nation’s destroyed infrastructure so literally. So, Eurovision is not so much a song contest as an exercise in international perceptions of justice, set to music. Its superficial romance is densely politically allegorical. Commentators used to be mystified, or at least pretend to be mystified, by the radical drop in the UK’s international standing, come the 21st century. After four decades of winning, running up, at the very least in with a bullet somewhere in the Top 10, suddenly the European community was united: we were irredeemably shit. All the usual and well-documented biases of neighbourliness, where countries who shared languages and cultural norms tended to vote for each other, were, in our case, reversed. The closer you were to the UK, the fewer points you would award us. Although this was hard to tell when those points in aggregate were none. The first year we scored nul points was 2003. Everyone thought it must be because of the Iraq war. That made sense at the time. You reap what you sow, and when you turn your back on the international peacekeeping order, you pay the price in the unflinchingly harsh light shone on Jemini, those off-key poppets. It was, at that time, an international first for us to score nothing at all, so whatever the explanation, it had to be something major. But, in retrospect, I think it was more likely a reflection of the new voting system, introduced in 2000, whereby the four nations contributing the most cash (France, Germany, Spain, the UK) were automatically allowed to skip the semi-finals and enter the contest. It defies, no, traduces the very principles of fair competition, producing an instant physiological disgust response. It would be as if they took the richest nation in the Olympics and just bumped it forward 10 metres in the sprint, then let the spectators vote on who was the fastest. Italy joined the money group in 2011, so it became the Big Five. That didn’t improve the group’s standing, but it was still only the UK that everyone really hated, and, for much of the past two decades, we have come either last or in the bottom five. It’s got worse since Brexit: we could have scored the ultimate hat-trick and come last for three years in a row, if the contest hadn’t been cancelled in 2020 because of the pandemic. The best explanation is the most obvious: there is a limit to the number of years a nation can spend strutting around, preaching its own exceptionalism, before that becomes all anyone can hear. Pipe any music you like over the top of it, and it’s all just more of your irritating noise. But, then, just when you think you understand, everything changes, and the UK comes second. Sam Ryder, who even looks a bit like Aslan, has uncovered a deeper truth. Music is elemental. Whatever aggravations pre-exist, they are all eradicated by the purity of song, so long as the song is pure, or is about bananas (thanks, Norway). No, just kidding – this was actually a sympathy vote. Having observed us over a number of years, our neighbours near and far have concluded that nobody suffers more at the hands of our obnoxious political class than we, their own tuneful people. Pity would never get us to No 1 – justice will always win out – but it can place us at a creditable second. Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,The days of nul points are over!

5/17/2022,"Digital investors have withdrawn savings in the “stablecoin” tether worth $7.6bn (£6.2bn) since the cryptocurrency crisis began last week, suggesting the company has paid out a sum almost twice its total cash holdings to spooked depositors. Stablecoins are supposed to have a fixed value matched to a real-world asset, in most cases $1 a token. However, faith in the concept was rocked last Tuesday when another big player, terra, broke its peg to the dollar. That has fuelled a wider sell-off across the crypto sector, which relies on stablecoins for much of its financial engineering. A stablecoin, like the name suggests, is a type of cryptocurrency that is supposed to have a stable value, such as US$1 per token. How they achieve that varies: the largest, such as tether and USD Coin, are effectively banks. They hold large reserves in cash, liquid assets, and other investments, and simply use those reserves to maintain a stable price. Others, known as ""algorithmic stablecoins"", attempt to do the same thing but without any reserves. They have been criticised as effectively being backed by Ponzi schemes, since they require continuous inflows of cash to ensure they don't collapse. Stablecoins are an important part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They provide a safer place for investors to store capital without going through the hassle of cashing out entirely, and allow assets to be denominated in conventional currency, rather than other extremely volatile tokens. Tether, the third biggest cryptocurrency by “market cap”, experienced a short-lived crisis on Thursday when its value dropped from $1 to 95¢ as savers feared it would follow its fellow stablecoin terra and collapse. However, the token, which is controlled by a private company with close links to the crypto exchange Bitfinex, has since largely restored its dollar peg by honouring a promise to allow savers to always withdraw $1 for every tether they give back to the company. The company only allows direct withdrawals of at least $100,000 for each request, and charges a fee of 0.1% on redemptions. Anyone with less tether than that minimum can only turn their money into dollars by finding someone to buy it from them – a disparity that fuelled the temporary collapse in value. Despite the difficulties, according to public blockchain data, $7.6bn of tether has been reallocated in this way since Thursday. That is almost twice the cash that Tether had in its reserves at the end of last year, according to accounts published on its website. Most of the rest of its reserves are held in “cash-like” assets, the majority of which are $35bn of US government debt and $25bn of corporate bonds. However, the company has refused to share any further details of the investments, with its chief technology officer, Paolo Ardoino, telling the Financial Times: “We don’t want to give our secret sauce.” There have long been fears as to Tether’s ability to honour all redemptions. The company had once said it backed its currency with “US dollars”, a claim the New York attorney general said in 2021 “was a lie”. Now, it simply claims its currency is “backed 100% by Tether’s reserves”. By contrast, terra was backed by a complex algorithm that required the value of a sister cryptocurrency, luna, to constantly rise in order to maintain the dollar peg. When the crash hit last week, the system went into a “death spiral”, automatically printing more luna, which crashed the price further, until luna lost 99.9995% of its value in a matter of days and terra was left languishing at $0.11. The charismatic founder of the Terra project, Do Kwon, has said he wants to relaunch the currency. In a proposal posted to the project’s message board on Friday, he suggested wiping all ownership of luna, and redistributing 1bn new tokens, with most going to those who hold the stablecoin, or who held luna before last week’s crash. “It is a hard balance – and no easy answers in redistributing value within the network,” Kwon wrote. “But value must be distributed to allow the ecosystem to survive, and in its current state it will not.” Kwon also faces questions about how the vast sums of bitcoin that his project had amassed to back terra were spent. According to a breakdown shared by the organisation, it sold more than 80,000 bitcoins, worth more than $2.4bn, to unnamed parties in exchange for terra valued at $1 – at a time when the public price of the currency was under 75¢. The jitters around stablecoins have combined with a general slump in tech stocks and the wider US downturn to trigger a wider crisis of confidence across the crypto sector. Bitcoin and ethereum, the two biggest cryptocurrencies, are down more than 10% over the last seven days, with ethereum dropping 17% to less than $2,000. Smaller currencies have, as always, been more volatile, with dogecoin falling 26% over the week. Even some of the most vocal backers of digital currencies are now querying the promises of the sector. The founder of the crypto exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, said in an interview with the Financial Times that bitcoin has no future as a payments network because of the inherent inefficiencies of its blockchain, the public digital register that records its transactions. Instead, he argued, it could only function as a gold-like store of long-term value.",News/Technology,$7.6bn of ‘stablecoin’ tether redeemed since start of crypto crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/16/stablecoin-tether-redeemed-crypto-crisis-terra
