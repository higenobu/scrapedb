4/9/2022,"When considering the approach of spring – the air lighter, the days longer, Easter delightfully on the horizon – pudding springs to mind. And, after recent years imbued with what shall remain nameless, it’s time, I think, for an extravagance: a tumble of meringues studded with hazelnuts, layered with pears, bronzed in caramel, infused with lemon and vanilla, and with ample cream, custard and ice-cream. It will make a splendid appearance at a table of good folk. Prep 20 minCook 1 hr 10 minCool 2 hr +Serves 12 For the meringue130g shelled hazelnuts10 egg whites500g caster sugar, split between two bowls For the pears4 comice pears, peeled, cored and quarteredJuice of 1 lemon1 vanilla pod, split and seeds scraped out100g caster sugar For the caramel syrup120g caster sugar75ml water For the cinnamon custard1 cinnamon stick250ml whole milk4 egg yolks50g caster sugar50ml double cream To serve100ml double cream, lightly whippedVanilla ice-creamIcing sugar Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and line two oven trays with baking paper. Put the nuts on one tray, roast for eight to 10 minutes, until golden, then tip into a clean cloth and rub to remove the skins. Coarsely grind or chop the nuts, and set aside 20g for later. In a clean bowl, whip the egg whites to stiff peaks, then beat in half the sugar in a steady shower until stiff peaks form again. Fold in the remaining sugar and the remaining 110g chopped nuts, then spoon half the mix onto each tray and spread into two 28cm circles. Transfer to the hot oven and immediately lower the temperature to 120C (110C fan)/250F/gas low. Bake for an hour until pale golden, then remove and leave to cool completely. Don’t worry about any cracks – they will be concealed when the meringues are dressed. Meanwhile, put the pears and lemon juice in a wide bowl, toss to coat, then stir in the vanilla pod and seeds. Have ready a wide dish by the stove. Put a wide-bottomed pan on a medium heat. Scatter in the sugar and, wrapping the handle in a cloth, shake the pan until the sugar evenly covers the base; keep shaking as it colours. Carefully lay in the pears, then gently shake again. Boil, stirring gently, for eight to 10 minutes, until evenly bronzed. Tip the pears and vanilla pod into the waiting dish, leave to cool, then remove the vanilla pod. (Rinse it, then leave to dry and, some time later on, steep in a jar of sugar to make vanilla sugar.) Put the sugar for the syrup in a pan on a medium heat. Move the pan gently until it’s bubbling at the edges then carefully swirl until it’s an even caramel colour. Once a uniform caramel is made, take off the heat, put on a stand, retreat slightly and, covering your hand with a cloth, pour in 75ml water; stand back until the spluttering subsides, then leave to bubble gently for a minute, until a syrup forms. Cool, then pour into a small jug. For the custard, put the cinnamon and milk in a pan on a medium heat and bring slowly to a simmer. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl. Remove the cinnamon stick, then slowly stir the infused milk into the egg yolks. Pour back into the pan, return to the heat and stir until the custard thickens but does not boil. Off the heat, stir in the cream, then cover and chill. To assemble the pudding, carefully loosen the cooled meringues from the baking paper, and lift one on to a plate that’s wider than the meringue. Drop half the whipped cream on top, followed by two-thirds of the pears. Pour over two-thirds of the syrup and add a scoop of ice-cream. Top with the second meringue, then repeat the layers, this time finishing with the custard, so it runs between the fruit and cream, and pools around the meringue. Strew with the reserved 20g hazelnuts, dust with icing sugar and serve.

4/9/2022,"The tragedy discovered amid the rubble of Bucha and Borodianka overshadowed any jubilation that Kyiv had defeated Russian forces that had spent a month trying to envelop the capital and snuff out the Ukrainian nation. Nevertheless, the defeat of Russian forces in the north marks a turning point in the war. For the medium term, Ukraine will now survive. But for its soldiers there is no respite, for having had its first objective denied Moscow has turned its gaze on the Donbas, where a major offensive is imminent. The Donbas has been at war for eight years. More than 90 Ukrainian soldiers were killed in 2021 defending the line of contact. Since late February Ukrainian positions have come under regular artillery fire, with mobilised civilians from Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk pushed into attacks on the Ukrainian trenches. The aim of this Russian activity was to fix the 40,000 Ukrainian troops in the Joint Forces Operations (JFO) area, preventing them from impacting the fights for Mariupol, Kharkiv or Kyiv. In the coming days the JFO is destined to become the focus of Russian attention. Having seized a land corridor from Rostov to Kherson, Russian forces are preparing to punch northwards to cut off lines of supply to Donetsk. Further Russian units – some newly formed and some repositioned – are forming up to push south around Luhansk from Kharkiv to complete the encirclement. The battle will be very different from the advance on Kyiv. Russian units at the beginning of the war were not ready or supplied for heavy fighting. Now the Russians appreciate what they are up against and with only two axes to support can concentrate their supplies. Russian air defences have good coverage over the Donbas and they will likely be able to bring significant air power to bear. Combined with their advantage in artillery, and the fact that the fighting will be in the countryside rather than into urban centres, Ukrainian troops will need to manoeuvre to survive. At the same time the Russians face a serious challenge. Ukrainian forces in the JFO comprise some of the country’s most professional and best-motivated units. The Russians have an advantage in firepower but will be fighting at close to numerical parity. If their plan is to encircle the JFO they will need to defend the cordon from both sides, and while Russian soldiers are now better prepared, morale remains a problem in many Russian units. Having committed the majority of his forces, President Vladimir Putin must hit his objectives before the Victory Day Parade on 9 May or else face a steady decline in Russian combat power through exhaustion. This is likely to encourage the Russians to apply many of their most devastating weapons systems. But if Putin fails he will then face a choice: to seek an exit or to move Russia on to a war footing and mobilise reserves. That would mean abandoning the fiction that the war in Ukraine is merely a “special operation”. For the Ukrainians the next month will be costly but potentially decisive. If Russia seizes the Donbas it can go firm and can pause while it brings up reserves for a summer offensive. On the other hand, if Russia fails to hit its objectives then many of its units will find themselves thrust forwards and exposed, at risk of persistent attrition like the troops who recently retreated from Kyiv. For the Ukrainian military the priorities for the battle in the Donbas differ slightly from what was needed for the urban defence. A consistent supply of anti-tank missiles and man-portable air-defence systems will remain invaluable. But the force will also need loitering munitions to target Russian air defences and artillery, creating opportunities for Ukrainian helicopters to resupply isolated units. They will need protected mobility to move their troops safely to new defensive positions. They will need a considerable quantity of artillery ammunition. For Ukraine’s allies there has been a persistent tension between providing military assistance that is immediately usable to stave off defeat, and systems that come with an associated training burden. The rate of Ukrainian equipment loss in the Donbas is likely to be higher than in the first phase of the conflict. If Ukraine is to be ready for the battle beyond the Donbas it will need to reconstitute some of its units. Now is the time, therefore, to begin supplying longer-term aid to regain the initiative.

4/9/2022,"Eight intense musicians are crammed into a circle in a snug chapel in central Cambridge, their audience mere inches away, on the same level but perched on chairs topped off by embroidered cushions. You would not want to risk the tight rat-run to the toilet as caroline’s players become more and more animated, jostling for what little elbow room there is. Moving at all is a risk, frankly, lest the wicker beneath you creaks as this big, loud band grow quieter and quieter. Mostly, caroline – they prefer a small c – play in the near-dark, setting up a dilemma for the Observer’s photographer. How to capture this transporting new act in full flow while not ruining their spell? (In the end, we have one song with the lights on.) The jagged tree line of microphones is there in part to capture the violins, flutes, trumpets and clarinets of this unconventional outfit. Caroline’s core sound takes its cues from American roots music. You might call what they do folk-rock. But the strings and brass are there to add lashings of drones rather than pretty, fiddly filigree. The forest of mics is there too because most of the band vocalise at one point or another, creating a feeling of ad hoc communion. Swells of mass group-sound seem to rise up, almost incidentally; on IWR (“I was right”) the backing vocals just materialise out of left field – singing that does not declare itself to be “singing”. But however abstract caroline get – tremulous flute, electronic growls and sheet metal clang from main percussionist Hugh Aynsley on tracks such as Natural Death all contribute to an ear-ringing night out – there is always a folk song of sorts waiting in the wings. Growing up outside Lewes, East Sussex, notional lead singer Jasper Llewellyn and guitarist Mike O’Malley spent their younger days singing Appalachian music at weddings and busking around Europe. Llewellyn has a stentorian vibrato he keeps on an impressively tight leash, until it unexpectedly knocks you sideways on songs such as Engine (eavesdropping). Caroline’s much-lauded, self-titled debut album came out in February, parts of it recorded in an empty swimming pool, parts on an iPhone, the rest in a studio. But for all its melancholy grace, sneaky crescendos and “sad boy triumphalism” – coined by Llewellyn in an interview – this band’s fissile brinkmanship is absolutely best experienced live. For caroline are a superorganism that feeds off itself. There is all the fun of the fair to be had in watching how the band’s two electric guitarists, Caspar Hughes – who met Llewellyn at the University of Manchester – and O’Malley, egg each other on. At the close of Skydiving onto the Library Roof, they dare one another to leave bigger and bigger gaps between the clanging downstrokes they play in unison. It’s a musical staring contest that would be comedic if it weren’t so tense. Trumpeter Freddy Wordsworth watches both guitarists, judging when to add his blare. The pleasure is in the contrasts: tiny church, big band; much anchoring repetition, broken up by surprises. There has been a mini-vogue of late for generously proportioned guitar bands playing abstract pieces. At one point there were six of Black Midi; back in January, members of that band joined caroline in a five-hour improvised set at London’s Southbank Centre. And although caroline don’t actually sound that much like the similarly populous Black Country, New Road – currently under reconstruction after the loss of their vocalist – a Venn diagram would reveal significant overlaps. Both BC,NR and caroline came up in south London, boast male and female members and uncommon instruments – Llewellyn plays cello as well as drums and guitar. Their generous compositions change tack as they unfurl. Post-rock is, naturally, another touchstone. In interviews, caroline have mentioned obsessing over a particular Mogwai snare sound. Ultimately, they’re not that far off tonight from the end-of-days instrumentals of Godspeed You! Black Emperor or Godspeed’s sister band with vocals, A Silver Mt Zion. Like all of those bands, caroline trade in challenge and consolation. They feel very much like a band of our fractured moment. It would be tempting to ascribe this latterday experimental, improvisational mood among guitar acts to the pandemic. But really, long-form instrumental music is rock’s shadow genre, always there, ready to supply abstract impressionism to supplement the more representational pictures of things drawn by mainstream guitar outfits. Whites-of-the-eyes gigs such as these have taken a particular battering in the past couple of years, too, with the loss of small venues and the reallocation of musicians and crew alike to “cyber” or delivery jobs. Even Sheffield’s venerable Leadmill seems under threat. So it’s an unalloyed pleasure to witness the steadfastness of local left-field promoters – shout out, Crushing Death & Grief – allied to a forward-thinking, wood-panelled, “non-prophet” church where the minister is a jazz-bass player; a fitting crucible for caroline’s emotive display of wild instinct tempered by great control.",Arts/Music,"caroline review – a heady, up-close gig for our fractured times",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/09/caroline-review-a-heady-up-close-gig-for-our-fractured-times
4/9/2022,"An adult marrying another adult of the same sex? Outrageous; the Lord will smite thee. An adult marrying a child of the opposite sex, on the other hand? Totally fine with God, apparently. Such is the perverse logic of the always righteous Republicans, a number of whom recently sponsored legislation that would legalize common law marriage in Tennessee. While that sounds innocuous on the surface the legislation is a shameless attempt to undermine same-sex marriage, which has been legal across the US since 2015. The bill’s mastermind, the Tennessee state senator Janice Bowling, explained that the bill declares “that the marriage between a man and a woman is not a creation of the state government or its statutes, it is a common law right”. Bowling also noted that the bill provides “an alternative form of marriage for those pastors and other individuals who have a conscientious objection to the current pathway to marriage in our law”. These conscientious objectors were so busy being homophobic that they didn’t have any time to be concerned about minor things like child marriage, it seems. The original iteration of the bill essentially eliminated minimum age limits to get married and paved the way for child marriage. As another state senator, Raumesh Akbari from Memphis, told reporters: “It’s ugly enough Republicans are advancing an unconstitutional bill to undermine marriage equality, but the fact that this bill reopens the debate on child marriage is outrageous.” The Republicans backing the bill didn’t seem too bothered by the whole child marriage thing when it was first pointed out but, after international backlash, they inserted an amendment adding a minimum age requirement of 17. Very noble of them. I got gay-married in the US last year and was naive enough to think that I wouldn’t have to worry about the government nullifying my nuptials. I thought, stupidly, that we were beyond all that: there is very broad support for same-sex marriage across pretty much every age group in the US, after all. And, for the last few years, Republicans have largely laid off the subject. Now, however, Republicans have fully ripped their masks off and are making no secret of the fact they intend to make second-class citizens of anyone in the US who isn’t a rich cis white dude. There have been an avalanche of bills attempting to undermine the constitutional right to a safe and legal abortion and a horrifying – and historic – wave of anti-LGBT legislation. Bloomberg reports that “Republican legislators have proposed at least 325 [anti-LGBT] bills so far [this year], with about 130 targeting transgender rights specifically. That’s already ahead of the 268 introduced last year, a previous record. A total of 27 made it into law in 2021, for the worst year in recent history for anti-LGBTQ legislation.” And while Republicans used to be relatively quiet about same-sex marriage, they’re now increasingly making noise about it. Senator John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, for example, used the supreme court confirmation process of now-Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to repeatedly opine that the high court wrongfully invented the right to same-sex marriage. The moral of this story? All of our rights are inextricably connected. Conservatives are not going to focus only on trans people and leave cis gay people alone. They’re not going to focus their energies on undermining reproductive rights and ignore LGBT people. They’re coming for everyone who doesn’t look and think like them. We cannot draw lines between the struggle for trans rights or gay rights or women’s rights: we are all in it together. The Republicans have made it very clear that if they haven’t come for your civil rights yet they will do so very soon. Because they’re morally bankrupt basically. And there may be a fair bit of projection going on since the Republican party appears to be disproportionately full of perverts and seemingly unbothered about things like child marriage. An analysis of federal data by the Associated Press found states with the most severe abortion laws have some of the weakest social programs in the US. So they force you to have a kid and then they do absolutely nothing to help give the kid a good start in life. Almost like they’re not actually pro-life, just pro-controlling women! Of course, conservative lawmakers seem unable to see the hypocrisy. In response to the AP study many conservative state lawmakers said, “don’t worry … you can just give up the child for adoption.” It seems that Gwyneth Paltrow has moved on from hawking vagina candles to shilling crypto and NFTs. “We have watched a lot of these bros get together and earn a lot of money,” Paltrow said in a recent Zoom presentation on crypto. “We deserve to be in this space just as much.” Nothing screams “feminism” like equal opportunity grifting! Anyone trying “to impede [a woman] from exercising her right to voluntarily interrupt pregnancy” through “bothersome, offensive, intimidating or threatening acts” will face jail time of between three and 12 months. There are approximately a gazillion studies showing social media to be a misogynistic hellhole. Now there’s another one. Will anything be done about it? I very much doubt it. The punny bar is based in Portland, Oregon, and was set up to try to address the gender imbalance in sports coverage. While 40% of professional athletes are female, women’s sports make up only 4% of all sports media coverage. For women with disabilities, it is more than one in four. Emmanuel Macron has promised gender equality would be the “grand cause” of his second term if he won. He also promised that before he won his first term. And then he went on to do things like wage a war on Muslim women and appoint hard-right Gérald Darmanin as interior minister in 2020 when the man was under investigation for rape. Macron defended his decision saying he trusted the minister “man to man” and the investigation was eventually dropped. So he hasn’t exactly distinguished himself over the past four years. A new study suggests that the perceived meaning of these labels is biased toward men. In other words: “whatever terms people may use in describing the average human, they are often mentally defaulting to ‘male’.” Remember Yakei? She made headlines last year after beating up her own mother to become the alpha female of the troop at the Takasakiyama natural zoological garden in Japan. She then roughed up the alpha male and became boss of a troop of 677 monkeys: the first alpha female in the reserve’s 70-year history. Guess what? She’s still going strong. The New York Times reports that while a messy love triangle threatened to weaken her grip on power she’s still the troop’s alpha. Long live the polyamorous matricidal monkey queen!

4/9/2022,"As childhood’s go, mine was relatively lovely. Our family was stable – my parents were generous and kind. We had difficult moments, but I don’t resent my upbringing. My parents valued discipline, a trait I see in myself as a dad today. Being obsessive has always been part of my personality. As a kid, I was often left with my imagination, more interested in internal worlds than what was happening around me. I had friends, but preferred being alone. At first I was consumed by Marvel comics, then music took over in my teens. By sixth form I was partying – clubs and raves opened up a whole new world. And I was always the last one to leave, desperate to feel and experience as much as I could. I’ll say I’ve lived a life, but I’ll save the gory details out of respect for Mum. I’ve got away with it so far. I feel most alive when I’m in the studio. There’s this magic to getting an idea down, the alchemy of pulling threads out of the air and seeing where it takes you. It’s such a magical feeling, that moment of creating something that’ll live on after you die. Reality TV gives me my fix of drama and conflict. If I have free time, I’ll gorge on Real Housewives (Potomac is my favourite), or Celebrity Ex On The Beach. There’s something about watching people navigate love and romance in artificial scenarios that keeps me hooked. Frank communication is the only way relationships can function properly. Bottling things up leads to disaster; let trauma come in and go out. Since having kids I’ve found myself crying more regularly. Yesterday I was reading my daughter a book – Lubna and Pebble – about a young Syrian refugee, when I broke down in tears. Explaining suffering and war to her broke my heart. My younger one is still so beautifully innocent. I keep asking myself: how long will it last? People with views antithetical to my existence needn’t be invited on to TV to be debated. Something strange is happening where racists and bigots are given airtime for so-called balance, when they believe one group of people is simply lesser than another. It makes no sense. I’m quite messy. It drives my partner wild. I spend a lot of time in my head, planning and scheming, so I don’t mind walking past piles of clothes or washing up in the house. I appreciate it’s not so considerate. I’m working on it now. Turning 40 felt insignificant. Now it seems like a milestone. I noticed grey hairs in all sorts of places – I’m in a different part of my life, worrying about different things. And for the first time in years, I have a routine at home with my family. I feel happiness and security, which I never saw for myself decades ago. Co-writing Leave to Remain, a musical, cross-cultural gay love story, was a real achievement. We created something that explored life for queer black men growing up in Britain. Seeing how people who look, think and live like me were moved by it, I felt so proud.

4/9/2022,"An immigration tribunal has overturned a “cruel and morally wrong” decision by the Home Office to deport a well-respected black charity volunteer who grew up in the UK. The tribunal ruled last week that Anthonell Peccoo, who arrived in London when he was six years old and spent most of his life in Bristol, would have his right to a family and private life infringed if he was deported to Jamaica. The judges said deportation would mean “exiling” Peccoo, 27, from the only country he has ever known, leaving him “an outsider” in Jamaica. “He has no family, friends or acquaintances in Jamaica. He has no recollection of the country at all. He has never been there since leaving at aged two. He was schooled in the UK and completed his education in the UK from age six to 18,” states the ruling. “He has known no other country.” The Home Office seeks to deport all foreign nationals sentenced to more than 12 months in jail regardless of how long they have lived in this country or if they have family or children. Officials targeted Peccoo for deportation after he was imprisoned for grievous bodily harm (GBH) and drugs offences in 2015. The department’s lawyers argued that he continued to remain a threat even after he had completed his sentence. But the tribunal said Peccoo, who runs a charitable barbershop for people on a low income in Bristol, did not pose a danger to society. The ruling acknowledges he had “shown genuine and tangible remorse” and that he had gone on to show “himself to be of great worth and value by his positive actions towards others”, noting he has “given back to society in significant terms and in many ways”. The judges remarked that deporting him would be “cruel and morally wrong” as it would undo his rehabilitation. One of the young people injured during the fight that led to Peccoo’s jail sentence even wrote him a character reference: “if anyone should want… Peccoo removed from this country it would be me,” but “I stand with Anthonell, I am fighting for him, with hundreds of people in Bristol…”. Peccoo, whose family struggled to formalise his immigration status when he was growing up, said he was glad the tribunal had recognised his deep roots in the UK and the contribution he was now making to society. “I am really excited [by the decision]. I can now get on with my life without having this overwhelming feeling that it could be taken away from me at any point,” he said. “I’ve already done so much with my limitations – I feel like I could contribute even more to the community in Bristol.” He plans to expand his “second combing” barbershop, which raises money for the LoveBristol church charity, so he can train disadvantaged people struggling with addiction or homelessness. “If I could give someone a second chance like how I got my second chance the world would be a little bit better,” he said. Official figures do not reveal how many of the 10,017 foreign-born offenders deported since 2019 under the controversial policy grew up in the UK, but one deportation flight last year included at least ten Jamaicans who arrived as children. Many people facing deportation have children and partners in the UK. Detention Action, which works with people facing removal, said half of the Jamaicans it has helped over the last five years arrived when they were under 18, with 32% under 13 on arrival. The judgment comes after a progress report into the Windrush scandal found last month the Home Office had failed to become more compassionate and couldn’t determine if people with an entitlement to British citizenship had been wrongly deported as foreign criminals. Peccoo’s plight generated widespread sympathy across Bristol. More than 90,000 people signed a petition supporting Peccoo and 345 people, including the Bristol mayor, Marvin Rees, wrote character references. Rees welcomed the outcome of the tribunal but said Peccoo should never have been put through such an ordeal. “For every single victory against the system, there are hundreds of people who are being failed. We cannot afford to not learn from this,” he said. Peccoo added: “I’ve been astonished that so many people care – I can’t go down the street without people asking me about my case.” The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said no person who calls the UK home should face exile to a country they barely know. “This government’s deportation rules amount to a cruel double punishment, with people – disproportionately black people – torn from their families after they’ve already served their time,” said Zoe Gardner, the group’s policy and advocacy manager. Peccoo had a difficult childhood. His mother took him from Jamaica to Antigua when he was two, then four years later to London, where his father was living. He was then put in the care of a family friend, who brought him up in Bristol. He has had no contact with his mother since she left him in the UK. He grew up thinking he was British and only discovered his immigration status was unclear when he applied for a job. Unable to find legal work, he began dealing drugs. But he got into a fight while selling cannabis in a park, which left three youngpeople injured. While the tribunal heard his crimes were serious, the judges noted they were his first offences and he has not been in trouble since his release. They also said the initial violence did not come from Peccoo, adding it could be seen as “excessive self-defence”. Many of the people targeted by the Home Office for deportation are found by the courts to be victims of modern slavery or human trafficking or have fears of persecution if they are returned. Government research shows nearly three-quarters of people subject to enforced returns raise concerns that prevent their deportation. Deportations of foreign-born offenders have been in long-term decline since 2012, with 1,977 people deported in 2021. A Home Office spokesperson said all claims were fully considered and decided upon before removal, and people would not be removed where there were outstanding claims or concerns. “This government puts the rights of the British public before those of dangerous criminals, and we’re clear that foreign criminals should be deported wherever it is legal and practical to do so,” they said.",News/UK news,‘Cruel’ move to deport charity worker from UK overruled,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/09/home-office-move-to-deport-charity-worker-anthonell-peccoo-overruled
4/9/2022,"The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, predicted a “cold war” with Georgia if it elects the Democrat and voting rights campaigner Stacey Abrams as governor this year. “If Stacey Abrams is elected governor of Georgia, I just want to be honest, that will be a cold war between Florida and Georgia,” DeSantis said at a press event in the north-west of his own state. “I can’t have [former Cuban leader Raúl] Castro to my south and Abrams to my north, that would be a disaster. So I hope you guys take care of that and we’ll end up in good shape.” DeSantis polls strongly among potential Republican nominees for president in 2024, with or without Donald Trump in the race. Accordingly, he has positioned himself as a major player on culture-war issues, recently signing a bill regarding the teaching of LGBTQ+ issues which critics labeled “don’t say gay”. In California, Los Angeles county has banned business travel to Florida and Texas over anti-LGBTQ+ policies. Such moves have also led DeSantis into direct confrontation with Disney, a major employer and economic engine in his state. On Friday, he said: “I don’t really care what the media says about that. I don’t care what, you know, very leftwing activists say about that. I do not care what big companies say about that. We are standing strong. We will not back down on that.” Abrams has become a major player in her own state, to the west of Florida, and a hate figure among conservatives. A former state representative and a successful author, she ran for governor in 2018 and lost narrowly to Brian Kemp, refusing to concede while protesting his role as secretary of state in controlling his own election. Abrams’ work to turn out Democratic votes, particularly among minorities, helped flip Georgia to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election and then elect two Democratic senators in runoffs in January the following year. She is running unopposed in the Democratic gubernatorial primary this year but trails both the incumbent governor, Kemp, and his Trump-backed primary challenger, former senator David Perdue, in early polling. Abrams did not immediately comment on DeSantis’s comment. A spokeswoman for DeSantis’s office said: “If Stacey Abrams wins the governorship of Georgia, we know that her approach to leadership will involve more heavy-handed government, taxes and bureaucratic influence.” Amid controversy, Craig Pittman, a Florida reporter and author, said the governor was “trying desperately to get attention from Fox News for saying something outrageous to own the libs and diss Black people”.",News/US news,"Stacey Abrams win in Georgia will lead to ‘cold war’ with Florida, DeSantis says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/09/stacey-abrams-georgia-florida-cold-war-desantis
4/9/2022,"Several thousand supporters of the protest group Extinction Rebellion were rallying near Speakers’ Corner in Hyde Park on Saturday for the start of the group’s latest campaign in central London. Hundreds of multicoloured flags bearing the “extinction” symbol of the environmental protest movement were fluttering above lawns closest to Marble Arch by 11am, while samba bands warmed up. XR has promised it will “grind the capital to a halt” over the coming week, with new tactics developed in response to increasingly harsh policing that minimised the group’s attempts to cause disruption last August. In Hyde Park, police vans and officers on horses patrolled the periphery of the crowd, but the policing presence appeared low-key. The crowd moved off about midday for a march through central London, staging road blocks on the way. Direct actions were planned on the fringes of the march against specific targets, but XR has kept quiet on the details of what those targets may be. During the morning, protesters mainly milled around joining with affinity groups, greeting friends who they had not seen since previous actions, and enjoying a burst of spring sunshine. Nicky Goulianis, 33, from London, stood in the middle of the crowd with her nine-month-old daughter, Clio, in a buggy. Asked why she had joined the protest, she answered: “All the reasons.” “I’ve been living away from the UK but I have been admiring the movement from afar, and I think it’s inspiring, the turnout here. I have been living in New York and I saw echoes of it in New York and I’m really excited to join today,” Goulianis said. “I think we need radical action. I think often the oil and gas lobby does a good job of making us think it’s about individual consumption, but we need to change everything.” On the edges of the crowd, with a small group, stood Marcelo Cervone, 28, who had adorned the peak of his baseball cap with XR stickers. He said: “I want to safeguard my son’s future … he’s four months old and I want to make sure he can dream but, as we were allowed to, dream big.” Cervone said he had been protesting with XR for several years. “We are all hoping we can end the fossil fuel economy. That’s the number one goal: immediate transition out of the fossil fuel economy,” he said. Dr Graeme Hayes, an academic at Aston University who studies social movements, was also among those gathering in Hyde Park. He has observed, researched and analysed XR since its beginning in 2018. “This is not a different thing, this feels like the same thing it looked like three years ago but probably with fewer people, and obviously its corralled out into a less enclosed space,” Hayes said. “The move from Parliament Square to Hyde Park is also that move from three years of interaction with policing and not being able to hold that public space.” Hayes said he felt ideological barriers were preventing XR from evolving. “I’ve taken lots of photos of all the different signs; so many are focused on children or your children’s children,” he said. “There is always a sense of how justice is a relationship to the future. There is a displacement of justice. As usual there’s loads about justice and it’s about Africa, and of course that is really important, but it’s not about here and it’s not about now. I’m trying to look for things about capitalism, for example, and it’s hard to find.”",News/Environment,Extinction Rebellion protesters vow to grind London to a halt ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/09/extinction-rebellion-xr-climate-protesters-march-london-hyde-park
