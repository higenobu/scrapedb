1/1/2022,"One upside from the climate crisis is that winters in northern Europe are warmer. The coldest January since 1659, when records began in England, was in 1795 when rivers including the Thames and Severn froze over. The temperature barely rose above freezing all month. Country parsons, who fed poor people at Christmas, gave them a shilling each to buy food for January. Grain was in already in short supply because of a dry summer and hunger became so widespread that the following spring there were bread riots.  In his diaries, James Woodforde, a country parson in Weston Longeville in Norfolk, who was troubled by gout on very cold nights, said that even the fire in the parlour made no difference. He worried that poor people were suffering badly because their vegetables were ruined by frost. On Saturday 25 January, there was a terrible storm that took the thatch off the barn and stripped the tiles from his roof. He still managed to dine “on a couple of boiled rabbits, beef steaks etc but the wind was so tempestuous we made a very poor dinner”. Three days later there was still a “very severe frost indeed. It freezes sharply within doors.” He also notes: “Two women froze to death Saturday last going home from Norwich market to their home.”",News/News,Weatherwatch: when rivers froze over in 1795,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jan/01/weatherwatch-when-rivers-froze-over-in-1795
1/1/2022,"A thumping headache, a tongue that feels like a carpet and a strong sense of queasiness and regret – it is a condition with which many will be all too familiar on New Year’s Day. But while it may seem tempting to reach for a hangover “cure”, researchers have chosen New Year’s Day to tell us that most will offer cold comfort. Scientists say they have evaluated studies looking at 23 different substances alleged to help prevent or treat a hangover, but found all of the “remedies” had low-quality evidence for how well they worked.  The study revealed only seven of the substances showed some sign of potential benefits for overall hangover symptoms, with participants giving a lower hangover symptom score, recorded as a percentage, compared with a placebo. “A hundred percent is really bad. So they have the worst hangover known to mankind,” said Dr Emmert Roberts, a co-author of the research based at the National Addiction Centre at King’s College London. Of these seven substances the largest and strongest effects were seen for clove extract, the anti-inflammatory drug tolfenamic acid, and pyritinol – a substance resembling two vitamin B6 molecules attached together. Participants taking a clove extract pill while drinking had, on average, a hangover symptom score of 19% compared with 43% for those who took a placebo pill. While the researchers said there would be limited harm in using such substances, it seems much more research is needed to explore whether they actually help the morning after the night before. The clove extract study, for instance, involved just 16 participants. Writing in the journal Addiction, Roberts and colleagues report how they looked at 21 studies, all assessing different alleged hangover cures, with 386 participants. Nevertheless the list has some surprising gaps. As Roberts notes, while some may find painkillers such as aspirin or paracetamol help with a hangover, neither has been studied for this purpose in randomised control trials. Among other limitations, the team notes that eight of the studies only involved male participants, while none involved adults over the age of 65. It is also not clear whether the findings of studies in one country would apply elsewhere. Furthermore, the team points out many of the studies had “significant degrees of imprecision in outcome measures of treatment effect” while 16 of the 21 studies involved sample sizes of fewer than 30 participants. Roberts suggested when it comes to hangovers, prevention is better than cure. “The most sensible thing to do is either to abstain from alcohol or drink in moderation,” he said. For those who are planning to drink more, Roberts said staying hydrated was likely to help – although, it was “not a surefire way to avoid a hangover”. Roberts has also stocked up on another option. “I have purchased a bottle of clove extract,” he said. Prof David Nutt, of Imperial College London and the government’s former chief drug adviser – who was not involved in the work – said the only way to stop a hangover was to drink less or consume alcohol-free alternatives. Nutt has developed the alcohol-free spirit Sentia, a drink that is claimed can make those who drink it feel “a mild sense of lightness and relaxation” without resulting in a hangover. “Hangover is probably the least researched major health impairment – costing the UK economy over £10bn a year,” he said.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Most hangover ‘cures’ have little evidence behind them, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/most-hangover-cures-have-little-evidence-behind-them-study-finds
1/1/2022,"Last New Year’s Day I found myself in the mildly paradoxical state of being relieved 2020 was finally over while still dreading the prospect of 2021. Twelve months on, I’m in the exact same position: the only thing preventing me from being glad to see the back of last year is the distinct possibility that 2022 will be worse still. A lot of this is, of course, subjective. The only way to accurately assess the goodness or badness of one particular year in relation to another is through the prism of cold, hard numbers. Here, then, is my personal statistical index for the year 2021, using the latest available figures:  100 Percentage of my adult offspring presently living with me, up from 66.6% this time last year. Initially, I considered this to be a 50% improvement – I was relieved to have them all under one roof, and it was also reassuring to have a generous amount of muscle in residence in times of need. But a stricter cost-benefit analysis – ie how much you spend feeding them versus the number of times you need help carrying a safe upstairs – proves a full house to be an expensive luxury. 27 Number of non-toxic courgettes successfully grown. In many respects it was a bumper season, but nobody remembers all those lovely, pale yellow, not even slightly poisonous courgettes I grew last year; just the two green ones that nearly sent my entire family to A&E after just a few bites. As far as I could work out, the poisoned variety were the result of accidental cross-pollination leading to a bad batch of commercial seed that produced courgettes laced with natural toxins that can cause – and I’m here to tell you, do cause – diarrhoea, abdominal pain and vomiting. Also occasionally hair loss and death – rarely in both cases, although absolutely anything seemed possible that night. After that fateful event nobody would eat any courgette grown by me, even after I licked the end of each one to prove their non-toxicity. Now I lick the end of all courgettes now, even the ones from the store, so I suppose a lesson of sorts has been learned. 6 Number of gigs the band I’m in played in 2021. It’s a lot more than the single gig we played between lockdowns in 2020, but rather less than the nine we were originally scheduled to play. One gig was cancelled and rescheduled three times, until it finally went ahead in October. We already have more than 20 gigs lined up for this year. I should probably practise. 4 Total number of injections received. This represents a huge increase over the previous year (0), the year before that (0) and the year before that (0). In fact, it’s almost certainly an annual record. I got my first vaccination jab in March and my second one in May. When I had the booster in November they asked me if I’d had a flu jab yet, and when I said no they gave me both, one in each arm. I walked out of that community centre feeling invincible, and woke up the next day feeling like crap. 1,063 Amount of money, to the nearest pound, that I spent on Covid tests in 2021. Again, it’s a big jump from 2020, when I spent nothing. I suppose one should average the total cost of testing across the whole pandemic, but in this case the entire sum was expended in an effort to get my family to the US for my father’s 100th birthday, the bulk of it on a single, ruinous trip to a drive-through testing centre in the States, 48 hours before our return. 19 By my reckoning, the total number of different names the old cat called me in 2021 in a bid to get my attention so I would feed it, or turn on the tap so it could drink from it. Those names included Mairead, Muireann, Meryl, Noirin, Noel and Joan, plus some minor spelling variations, none of which were even close to my actual name. Then, in August, the old cat died. RIP James. 1 New cats acquired. I thought it was too soon to replace the old cat with a new kitten, but I was overridden by four votes to one. It arrived in October and proceeded to wreak havoc upon our household. Months later, it still jumps out at me from hidden corners and it still stands on my plate while I’m eating. At least it doesn’t call me names. I sort of miss that, to be honest.

1/1/2022,"“Vinegar can be made from any fermented alcohol or solution of fermentable sugars,” says the fermentation expert and author Sandor Katz, whose recipe in his book The Art of Fermentation I have adapted here. “The word vinegar comes from [the French] ‘vin-aigre’, which means ‘sour wine’. That’s why people don’t like to drink the dregs of wine, because after 24 hours they start to turn vinegary.” Katz explains how simple it is to make vinegar: “Take leftover wine, and put it in a jar that gives it a high ratio of surface area to volume” – in other words, in something that’s not full all the way to the top. “And make sure it has good access to oxygen: put a cloth over it and the process will just happen. It will happen faster if you add some sort of vinegar starter, but you don’t really need to do that, because the acidobacteria are everywhere.”  Katz recently brought out a new book called Sandor Katz’s Fermentation Journeys that is full of wonderful stories and recipes from around the world, as well as all sorts of traditional fermentation techniques. Fermentation is a vital tool that can help prevent food waste through preservation. For a better success rate, I’ve included vinegar with its mother (AKA raw live vinegar) in today’s recipe, but Katz assures me that it isn’t necessary and that vinegar can be made simply by leaving alcohol to oxidise. Dregs of leftover wine will make wine vinegar, cider will make apple cider vinegar and beer malt vinegar; mixtures work, too. Buy vinegar with the mother at big supermarkets or online, and once you’ve made one batch, keep some aside with the mother to seed your next batch of vinegar without any extra outlay at all. Live vinegar with the mother is a highly valued food product, and, considering how easy it is to make vinegar, I’m going to start making a continuous batch at home using leftover wine. Katz told me how to do this: “I have an Italian-American friend called Ricky Boscarino, who has a four- to six-litre cask with a little spigot and a hole at the top for making vinegar. If you have a bottle of wine at his house and there’s a bit left at the bottom at the end of the evening, he pours it into the cask. Then, when he’s making a salad dressing or whatever, he’ll just open up the spigot, release some vinegar and use that. He does this as a continuous process, rather than making it in batches.” 300ml leftover alcohol (beer, cider and/or wine diluted with the same amount of water)100ml raw vinegar (ie with the mother)1 x 500ml wide-mouthed jar (500ml or larger)Cheesecloth and a rubber bandNarrow-neck bottles, to store If you’re making wine vinegar, dilute the wine with an equal volume of water first, but cider and beer are fine just as they are. In a large, wide-mouthed jar, mix three parts beer, cider or diluted wine with one part vinegar with its mother. Cover the top of the jar with a piece of cheesecloth, seal in place with a rubber band, then store in a warm place – in an airing cupboard or near a radiator, say – and out of direct sunlight for a few weeks, until the gluey smell dissipates and the contents taste properly acidic. A film, or “mother”, will form on the surface, so once you’ve made your first batch, save this mother and enough vinegar as the base for your next batch. As soon as the vinegar is ready, decant into a sterilised bottle (or bottles), seal tightly and store in a cool place. Enjoy immediately, or store for six months (or longer) for a superior taste.",Lifestyle/Food,How to turn leftover alcohol into vinegar – recipe | Waste not,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/01/how-to-turn-leftover-alcohol-into-vinegar-recipe-zero-waste-cooking

1/1/2022,"Before the experience of the past two years of Covid-19, I had assumed that a deadly viral outbreak would be quickly contained by governments. Especially in rich countries with good health systems, public health infrastructure, economic support packages and trust in public institutions. I thought there would be general consensus on what needed to be done, and that people would get their information directly from experts working in universities and public health authorities. I mean, who would want to risk getting a deadly infection? Now, I wonder if an even more deadly virus – like a pandemic-ready version of Mers, a coronavirus which killed 20% of those it infected in South Korea before being contained in 2015 – would be treated the same way as Covid-19. Would thousands of people show up at protests because theyhad read on Facebook that Mers was a hoax? Would there be similar scenarios at every pandemic after that? After my experience of actively working through the Covid-19 pandemic, these possibilities seem horrifyingly possible.  One of the most unpredictable aspects of the past two years, and one of the most disheartening, has been the rise of widespread misinformation. The line between facts and lies has disintegrated. Years of experience in infectious disease control and a doctorate or medical degree quickly became equivalent to the influencer on YouTube or Facebook who has garnered hundreds of thousands of followers by promoting exciting-but-untrue “facts”. You can see this clearly in the rise of anti-vaccine sentiment, where popular conspiracists share stories about alleged side-effects such as how vaccines are microchipping our bodies, or changing our DNA, or poisoning us. This has gone far beyond social media chatter and personal resistance, becoming an aggressive real-world campaign that has led to protests at hospitals, health workers being attacked and scientists being mailed death threats. I’ve personally learned that lies spread faster than truth. People have written entire blogs attacking my expertise and sharing clear falsehoods – such as the claim that I have no published scientific papers, or that I’m a global plant by the World Economic Forum or Gates Foundation, or that I am a philosopher rather than a scientist (because I have a DPhil from Oxford). It’s easy to laugh at such obvious untruths, until it sinks in that this clickbait gets shared thousands of times. People believe it, and then they too share it. And there is no way to counter every single falsehood. These lies carry more weight among some internet communities than the fact that Edinburgh University evaluated my expertise and granted me a professorship. I always try to counter these claims by sharing my funding sources, being transparent about what data I’m using for my analyses and advice, and acknowledging that while I might get things wrong, I always have tried to conduct myself with integrity and academic professionalism. But this isn’t always enough. There are many people voicing strong opinions who aren’t constrained the same way. Lots of politicians and leaders are seeking popularity, often by actively opposing basic public health measures. There are social media celebrities who build followings by sharing emotionally appealing lies. There are even academics who staked a claim with a certain camp early in the pandemic, and haven’t shifted their thinking despite new tools such as vaccines, mass testing and antivirals becoming available. The power of misinformation can be seen in the number of people appearing in hospitals, desperately sick with Covid-19 and struggling to breathe, who still say it is a hoax, and don’t believe that this is an actual virus (like many other viruses) that infects humans and makes us ill. A basic fact that somehow is harder for them to believe than the idea that this is a global conspiracy for government takeover of citizens. How is someone supposed to sift facts and real data from manufactured and glitzy stories on social media? There is little to no regulation of quality of data or sources on the internet. Some of the small lessons I’ve learned are to explain science clearly and simply so that it is comprehensible to everyone, and to try to reach people in small groups or at an individual level; fighting misinformation on social media is a losing battle. Important too is for experts to engage with TV, radio and newspapers, as mass media still carries considerable influence. Now is the time to understand and address these problems. I’ve written a book – out next year – about the experience of advising government and trying to communicate the fast-moving science and policy of the pandemic to the public, and hopefully how to do everything better next time. Reflecting and thinking ahead isn’t a theoretical exercise because we know that the next pandemic is coming – whether it is Mers or Sars or something else – and there may not be a quiet time to do it. Like everything else in the past two years, we have to learn these lessons as we go.

1/1/2022,"Doctors say a decision to exempt health workers in New South Wales from self-isolating if they are close contacts reflects an “extremely desperate situation”, with warnings the policy change will increase the Covid risk to hospital patients. NSW Health announced late on Friday night that in “exceptional circumstances”, frontline workers who are asymptomatic close contacts will be exempt from having to self-isolate for seven days, to avoid disruption to key services.  The exemption “allows these close contacts to leave self-isolation to attend their workplace, provided they have been identified by their employer as critical to the service and cannot work from home.” Dr Chris Moy, the vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, said the policy change was indicative of the “enormous stress” the NSW health system was under “because of the increasing number of cases … Just as much, it’s because of the number of staff who are having to be furloughed.” Covid hospitalisations in NSW were currently lower than at the peak of the Delta wave, but had more than doubled in the last week. On Saturday, there were 901 people in the state hospitalised with the virus, compared to 388 on Christmas Day. The state now had one of the highest rates of Covid in the world. “It’s not just about the number of beds [taken], it’s about the number of staff to be able to safely provide healthcare,” Moy told Guardian Australia. “We’re having entire teams getting wiped out, essentially.” As of 27 December, about 2,000 health workers across the state were self-isolating. On Friday, a leaked memo revealed St George hospital in Sydney’s south was already planning to fly in nurses in an attempt to deal with staffing shortages and surging Covid cases. Moy said that among medical professionals there was “a level of desperation which is not reflected in comments that the health system is holding up well”.

Talley said the policy change was a means to “urgently deal with a major staffing matter which doesn’t seem to be fillable any other way”. “People will suffer or even die if we don’t have people caring for them in hospital, but of course it will have some negative downsides that could be very serious as well,” he said. The self-isolation exemption would “put not only hospital workers at more risk from their colleagues, but also patients in hospital will be at higher risk of catching Covid,” Talley said. “It’s a dreadful situation to have ended up in and it was potentially preventable if we hadn’t let go so early.” A senior doctor working in Sydney, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the situation in his health district as “at crisis point”. “Things are absolutely terrible, with a combination of high numbers of patients and staff being off, furloughed or sick,” he said, adding there were high presentations to the emergency department and “ramping” – patients having to wait in ambulances because the department was full. He said though there were less Covid patients in the intensive care unit compared to the peak of the Delta wave, staffing shortages meant the service had to “significantly cut back” on bed capacity. Omicron is linked to a substantially reduced risk of hospitalisation and admission into intensive care, but experts said the variant’s transmissibility could still threaten to overwhelm the health system. “As cases rise massively, there are still some people … who will need hospitalisation,” Talley said. “If you’ve got a huge number of people infected, that’s a very significant load.” Moy said: “A large number [of people] are ending up in hospital at the same time, but also a large number of staff are getting infected at the same time, and they’ve been taken out of play.” To reduce the peak, Moy said it was necessary to reconsider restrictions, and to maximise TTIQ – test, trace, isolate, quarantine. “The problem at the moment is that [the testing system] is barely functioning. “What you’re trying to do is buy time … to get boosters in arms,” he said.
