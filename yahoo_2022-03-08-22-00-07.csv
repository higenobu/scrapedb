3/8/2022,"Russian forces in Ukraine have been ‘hacked’ after abandoning their own secure encrypted phone system, according to investigative journalism organisation Bellingcat. The switch to insecure messaging meant that a conversation revealing the death of Major General Vitaly Gerasimov - chief of staff of the 41st Army - was able to be intercepted by Ukrainian intelligence. Russian soldiers have switched off their encrypted phone system after towers were destroyed and are using normal phones with local sim cards, according to Bellingcat, an open-source investigative journalism organisation. Bellingcat’s executive director, Christo Grozev, said in a series of Tweets: ‘The idiots tried to use the Era cryptophones in Kharkiv, after destroying many 3g cell towers and also replacing others with stingrays. Era needs 3g/4g to communicate.’ ‘In the phone call in which the FSB officer assigned to the 41st Army reports the death to his boss in Tula, he says they've lost all secure communications. Thus the phone call using a local sim card. Thus the intercept.’ Read more: Russia says military action will stop immediately if Ukraine agrees to four conditions Bellingcat specialises in uncovering information on events such as the Salisbury poisonings and events in Syria by analysing large data sets. In the Ukraine conflict, the group has previously debunked ‘staged’ Russian excuses for war. Stingrays are eavesdropping devices which are used to ‘replace’ normal cell towers, so that nearby mobiles connect to the listening device instead. Era is an encrypted communication system used by the Russian military: such systems mean that military units can communicate without the risk of eavesdropping. Grozev said, ‘In the call, you hear the Ukraine-based FSB officer ask his boss if he can talk via the secure Era system. The boss says Era is not working. ‘Era is a super expensive cryptophone system that they introduced in 2021 with great fanfare. It guaranteed work “in all conditions”.’ Bellingcat also claims to have identified the officer on the call: Dmitry Shevchenko, a senior officer in the FSB. The claims have yet to be independently verified. Throughout the conflict, groups have claimed to have intercepted Russian communications, due to units relying on walkie-talkie radios and smartphones. British intelligence company Shadowbreak claimed to have intercepted messages which showed that Russian troops were demoralised and had ‘deliberately punched holes’ in vehicle fuel tanks to avoid reaching the front line, the Telegraph reported.

Netblocks said, The disconnection of fixed-line internet and some mobile service in and around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in #Ukraine is raising concerns over public safety, with radiation levels no longer published and the IAEA unable to monitor.’ But Russian forces are believed to be generally trying to keep mobile phone connections and internet working. Speaking to Politico, James Lewis, senior vice president and director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies told Politico: ‘If they can do localised d shutdowns of telecommunications, they’ll do it. But in general, they’ll want to keep the phones working in Kyiv because they can listen in.’ It’s also possible that Russian forces have left Ukrainian commercial networks operating as they are relying on them to communicate, Politico suggested.

3/8/2022,"CNN’s Anderson Cooper says a video from Russia that has gone viral amid the country’s invasion of Ukraine perfectly sums up the fear and weakness of its president, Vladimir Putin. Cooper, appearing on Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” live from Lviv in Ukraine on Monday, recalled the footage of Russian riot police arresting a woman in her 80s for protesting the war with handmade signs on the street. “To me, it was the most incredible image because I thought Vladimir Putin, who likes to appear half-naked riding around on a horse, or in his black belt doing judo as a tough guy, is scared of an 80-something-year-old woman who is simply standing on a street holding up a sign protesting a war,” he said. Russia’s new law that criminalizes media reports contradicting the Kremlin’s version of events in Ukraine ― which has prompted multiple networks to suspend reporting from Moscow ― was a “sign of weakness” and “fear” and “of the reality of the disinformation campaign that Russia wages,” Cooper added.

3/8/2022,"A Florida Highway Patrol trooper is home and recovering on Monday after she used her vehicle to block a rogue driver that was speeding towards a pedestrian event taking place on the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, the agency said in a news release. The driver, 52-year-old Kristen Kay Watts of Sarasota, bypassed an Interstate 275 closure and failed to stop for multiple law enforcement officers before the crash took place just after 8:45 a.m. Sunday. Watts was later arrested on charges of DUI, two counts of DUI with property damage and two counts of reckless driving involving injury and property damage. “The Florida Highway Patrol applauds the actions of Trooper Toni Schuck, a 26 year veteran of the patrol who, as the last line of defense to the Skyway 10K runners, placed herself in harm’s way to protect others,” the agency said in a news release Monday. Dashcam footage released by the agency on Monday shows the moment when Watts’ BMW sped past one FHP cruiser attempting to block her passage on northbound I-275. Her sedan then crashed nearly head-on into Schuck’s patrol SUV. Both Schuck and Watts were seriously injured in the crash, FHP said. This year’s Skyway 10K had 8,000 racers participating, organizers of the charity event said on Facebook. On Monday, organizers also shared a public thank you to Schuck. “On behalf of the Skyway 10K, we are beyond thankful for our law enforcement partners and the trooper who risked her life to keep our race participants safe,” the post says. Watts was listed as in custody at the Manatee County Jail on Monday afternoon. She was held in lieu of $52,000 bail. Schuck “continues to recover from her injuries with her family at home,” FHP said, and anyone wanting to send her well wishes can send mail to Florida Highway Patrol, 11305 North McKinley Drive, Tampa, FL 33612 or contact the agency on social media.",U.S./Bradenton Herald,"Dashcam shows Florida trooper hit, stop car headed for Skyway Bridge full of 10K runners",https://news.yahoo.com/dashcam-shows-florida-trooper-hit-231015836.html
3/8/2022,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A senior member of Russia's ruling party has proposed nationalising foreign-owned factories that shut down operations in the country over what the Kremlin calls a special military operation in Ukraine. Several foreign companies including Toyota, Nike and home furnishings retailer IKEA have announced temporary shutdowns of stores and factories in Russia in order to put pressure on the Kremlin to stop its invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. In a statement published on Monday evening on the United Russia website, the secretary of the ruling party's general council Andrei Turchak said that shutting operations was a ""war"" against the citizens of Russia. The statement mentioned Finnish privately-owned food companies Fazer, Valio and Paulig as the latest to announce closures in Russia. ""United Russia proposes nationalising production plants of the companies that announce their exit and the closure of production in Russia during the special operation in Ukraine,"" Turchak said. ""This is an extreme measure, but we will not tolerate being stabbed in the back, and we will protect our people. This is a real war, not against Russia as a whole, but against our citizens,"" he said. ""We will take tough retaliatory measures, acting in accordance with the laws of war,"" Turchak said. Fazer and Valio did not wish to comment when contacted by Reuters. Paulig did not respond. Fazer, which makes chocolate, bread and pastries, has three bakeries in St Petersburg and one in Moscow, employing around 2,300 people. Valio has one cheese factory and employs 400 people in Russia, and Paulig has a coffee roastery and employs 200 people in the country. Last week, non-NATO member Finland, which shares a border with Russia, agreed to strengthen security ties with the United States as it nervously watches Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

3/8/2022,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) attempted to blame Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Joe Biden Monday, only to be brutally humiliated by an acknowledged expert on the situation: Retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. It started when the controversial lawmaker posted a tweet on Sunday claiming “Biden’s poor decision making leading up to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin declaring war on Ukraine.” But Vindman, who as a former national security aide offered key testimony in President Donald Trump’s 2019 impeachment for dealings with Ukraine, refused to let Greene’s statement go by without a fact check. “Nope. It’s because you and your pro-Putin party encouraged Putin to invade, by cheerleading him,” Vindman responded. Vindman’s wife, Rachel Vindman, also chimed in, calling Greene “crazy stupid” and asking, “why do you insist on telling us over and over?” Greene attacked Vindman, saying he wants to “drag Americans into war with Russia with his big tough tweets and his zoom interviews on CNN,” but didn’t deny the substance of his arguments. Nor did she deny or object to him accusing her and the GOP of being “pro-Putin.” This clown wants to drag Americans into war with Russia with his big tough tweets and his zoom interviews on CNN.Go ahead and go fight yourself since you’re from Ukraine.You are clueless about Americans being fed up with sending our sons and daughters to die in foreign lands. https://t.co/hBB2vHUjtN — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (@RepMTG) March 7, 2022 Vindman later responded with a heartfelt tweet reminding Greene and others that he proudly served in the U.S. Army after he and his family came to the country as refugees. This is what service looks like. I served my country--the United States of America who welcomed my refugee family--for 21 years, 6 months, & 10 days in uniform & I continue to serve out of uniform.
