2/1/2022,"Six historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) reported bomb threats on Monday, cancelling classes for thousands of students. It was the second time this month that HBCUs faced simultaneous threats.  Earlier in January, at least eight HBCUs reported bomb threats. All reported “all-clears” later the same day, the Washington Post reported. It was unclear if the threats on Monday were connected to the earlier threats. According to school officials, threats were sent on Monday to Howard University in Washington DC; Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida; Southern University and A&M in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Albany State University in Albany, Georgia; Bowie State University in Bowie, Maryland; and Delaware State University in Dover. At least five schools remained on lockdown as local law enforcement worked to investigate the threats, according to CNN. Howard issued an all-clear for its campus less than two hours after the threats were reported at 4.35am, reported the Washington Post. Daytona Beach police announced via Twitter that the Bethune-Cookman campus had been cleared but classes remained cancelled and the public should avoid the campus unless necessary. In a statement, the FBI said it was “aware of the series of bomb threats around the country and we are working with our law enforcement partners to address any potential threats”. The co-chairs of the Congressional Bipartisan HBCU Caucus, Alma Adams of North Carolina and French Hill of Arkansas, said: “We are deeply disturbed by a second round of bomb threats at HBCU campuses within a month. “Learning is one of the most noble and most human pursuits, and schools are sacred places that should always be free from terror. Solving these crimes and bringing those responsible to justice should be a top priority for federal law enforcement.”",News/Education,Bomb threats reported at six HBCUs prompt class cancellations,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/31/bomb-threats-reported-six-hbcus
2/1/2022,"Sometimes less is more. When the Metropolitan police finally got round to investigating the parties at No 10, after being presented with the evidence by Sue Gray, and then insisted she doctor her final report, it was generally assumed to be a win for The Suspect. The Greased Piglet escapes again after an establishment cover-up. Only Gray had other ideas. Rather than punting out a whitewash, she just said: “Fuck you” and downed tools.  Gray wasn’t going to play ball. She was going to make clear there was no way she could submit a meaningful report when 12 of the 16 parties were subject to a criminal investigation. At best, she could offer a partial update. Just 12 pages, two of which were blank and the others all an indictment of the prime minister’s operation. It was no wonder everyone in No 10 was shattered during the pandemic. Who wouldn’t have been, with so many parties? And it might be an idea to laminate Boris Johnson’s briefing papers to save them getting ruined with wine spills. Gray concluded her brief update by noting that NHS staff were working under appreciably more stress than No 10 and they weren’t out breaking the rules and getting trashed every night. So it was a far trickier Commons appearance for The Suspect when he came to give his statement on the Gray report than he had hoped. He started by saying he was sorry. That was his first lie. He wasn’t at all. He never is. Other than to be sorry for having been found out. And from that point, he just kept on lying. His main theme seemed to be: “If only everyone else could read the redacted parts of the report relating to the 12 parties – one of which was in my own flat – that are the focus of a police investigation then you, too, would see I was innocent.” The Suspect blamed all those around him. There would be a wholesale restructuring of the entire No 10 operation. How many people would be fired? Precisely as many as were required for the Greased Piglet to retain his own job. Besides, now that he had skim-read the update a second time, he had come to the conclusion that Gray was basically exonerating him of all wrongdoing. He was that mendacious. That delusional. In reply, Keir Starmer was at his most damning. Often at prime minister’s questions, the Labour leader has used humour to expose the absurdity of The Suspect’s lies. Now he chose outright contempt. Scorn for a leader who had brought shame on himself, his country and his ministerial colleagues without the self-worth to stand up to him and have trashed what little integrity they might have had. What part of a prime minister being investigated for an illegal party in his own flat did he think was OK? Johnson was left without honesty and without honour. A moral black hole that destroyed all those around him. When would the Tory party rediscover some decency? Hell, it wasn’t as if much was needed. The government benches were eerily silent as the Labour leader spoke. Maybe the truth was slowly seeping into their consciousness. Now The Suspect really began to lose it. First he accused Starmer of failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile as director of public prosecution. Another outright lie. One that seemed too much even for his own frontbenches as various ministers seemed to be having second thoughts about having come to the chamber to offer their support and were looking to leave. Then, Johnson claimed that he alone was propping up Nato against a Russian invasion of Ukraine. This at the time his first ever phone call to Vladimir Putin was being cancelled because The Suspect was too busy saving his career. The reality is that he’s seen as a joke around the world. The UK’s own Berlusconi. It was almost as if Boris was punch-drunk. Unable to connect with reality. Much more of it and he would have denied all knowledge of being prime minister and it was up to the police to decide who was actually living in the Downing Street flat. Come to think of it, that shark had already been jumped. The Suspect lives in various multiverses in which there are any number of realities he might have lived. So when he says he stands by what he said, that phrase no longer has meaning as there are too many versions to pin down. He is the postmodern prime minister. A shambling exhibit of well-past-his-prime performance art. An embarrassment to everyone but himself. A more considered, self-reflective Johnson might have at least pretended to be more apologetic. Instead he just laughed and toyed with the toddler haircut, as opposition MPs made the error of asking him to tell the truth. The SNP leader, Ian Blackford, achieved his objective of getting red-carded from the chamber for calling Johnson a liar and saying he had deliberately misled parliament. This was a through-the-looking-glass moment. Blackford goes for telling the truth. Johnson stays for lying. There were some unhappy Tories. Theresa May said The Suspect could either have failed to understand the rules or thought they didn’t apply to him. Andrew Mitchell formally withdrew his support. Aaron Bell wondered if Johnson thought all those who obeyed the rules were fools. Mark Harper wanted Gray’s final report published when the time came. Something to which Johnson would not commit. Though within minutes of the statement ending, a spokesperson said he would, unless he could think of a way not to. Otherwise, the few Conservatives who did have something to say – most kept quiet and long before the end it was only opposition MPs doing the talking – could only talk nonsense. Voters were fed up with stories of cake and parties. What they were crying out for was a wholesale reform of the civil service in No 10. Yeah, right. Natalie Elphicke was so moved by Johnson’s contrition she begged him not to go easy on refugees. Keeping it classy.

2/1/2022,"There are an estimated 73,300 species of tree on Earth, 9,000 of which have yet to be discovered, according to a global count of tree species by thousands of researchers who used second world war codebreaking techniques created at Bletchley Park to evaluate the number of unknown species. Researchers working on the ground in 90 countries collected information on 38m trees, sometimes walking for days and camping in remote places to reach them. The study found there are about 14% more tree species than previously reported and that a third of undiscovered tree species are rare, meaning they could be vulnerable to extinction by human-driven changes in land use and the climate crisis.  “It is a massive effort for the whole world to document our forests,” said Jingjing Liang, a lead author of the paper and professor of quantitative forest ecology at Purdue University in Indiana, US. “Counting the number of tree species worldwide is like a puzzle with pieces spreading all over the world. We solved it together as a team, each sharing our own piece.” Despite being among the largest and most widespread organisms, there are still thousands of trees to be discovered, with 40% of unknown species believed to be in South America, according to the paper published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Some of these undocumented species would probably have been known to indigenous communities but some, in the most inaccessible regions, may have never been found before. The Amazon basin appears to have the highest diversity of tree species at local level, with 200 tree species a hectare. Researchers believe this could be because it is a warm, wet environment suited to supporting a wider range of species. To estimate the number of unknown species, scientists used the Good-Turing frequency estimation, which was created by the codebreaker Alan Turing and his assistant Irving Good when trying to crack German codes for the Enigma machine during the second world war. The theory, which was developed by the Taiwanese statistician Anne Chao to be applied to the study of undetected species, helped researchers work out the occurrence of rare events – in this case unknown species of trees – using data on observed rare species. Essentially, the code uses information on species that are only detected once or twice in data to estimate the number of undetected species. The idea to do an inventory of the planet’s trees came 10 years ago when Liang found data on Alaska’s trees sitting in a drawer. He was impressed by the findings and made it his personal mission to get the data online. He then wrote a proposal to do an inventory of the whole world. “People initially laughed at me,” he said. There is no data on how the number of tree species may have changed over time, although many species are thought to be threatened with extinction due to deforestation and the climate crisis. Scientists are worried many will disappear before they have been documented. Liang said: “We hope this paper will provide us with benchmark data so that we can know if the total number of tree species in the world has been declining, especially during our mass extinction event. “We need to look at the forest as not just a carbon reservoir, or a resource for extraction; we should look at our forests as a habitat that contains tens of thousands of species of trees, and even a much higher number of flora and fauna – we need to pay attention to this biodiversity.” Dr Ruth Mitchell, a plant-soil ecologist at the James Hutton Institute in Scotland, who was not involved in the research, said it showed that even for organisms as large as trees, new species were still being discovered. “It is very exciting, yet at the same time concerning that we are losing so much biodiversity so rapidly that we don’t even know about,” she said. “This study highlights the incredible diversity within our forests, much of which is still out there waiting for us to discover.” Martin Lukac, professor of ecosystem science at Reading University, who was also not involved in the paper, said: “The paper shows that almost half of the world’s tree species are in South America – this is a diamond-hard proof that we must not destroy the tropical forests there. “The tree-species diversity took billions of years to accumulate in the Amazon,” he said. “It would be beyond reckless to destroy it inside a century.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,"Global count estimates Earth has 73,000 tree species – 14% more than reported",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/31/global-count-estimates-earth-has-73000-tree-species-bletchley-park-good-turing-frequency-estimation
2/1/2022,"Good morning. Nearly half of Australia’s aged care facilities are battling Covid outbreaks. The UK warns Moscow that an invasion of Ukraine would be met with “massive consequences for Russia’s interests and economy”. And what’s new to streaming in Australia. Unboosted aged care residents are dominating Australia’s Covid death toll, with almost half of the country’s aged care homes battling outbreaks. It comes as the Morrison government defends missing its own booster rollout deadline. More than a quarter of aged care staff say their workplace is not giving them free rapid antigen tests, with nearly 20% reporting they’ve had to find and buy their own kits before working. Trade unions have lashed the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the Coalition over the findings of the new survey from the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Foundation, saying it was “an indictment on this government” that aged care workers were forced to dip into their own pocket for the tests  Liz Truss, the British foreign secretary, has said Russian oligarchs and key supporters of Vladimir Putin will be targeted by UK sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. In a statement to MPs on Monday, Truss refused to name any individual Russians at risk of being sanctioned, but insisted the Russian president’s allies would have nowhere to hide their assets if an invasion went ahead. It comes after the United Nations security council met to discuss the Ukraine crisis, with Washington vowing to hold Moscow to account. Fears of an imminent incursion have grown in recent days, despite denials from Moscow and pleas from Ukraine’s president to avoid stirring “panic” over the massive Russian military build-up on the border. The high court should overturn a landmark decision finding Aboriginal Australians cannot be aliens because it threatens to confer “political sovereignty on Aboriginal societies”, the Morrison government has argued. Government lawyers made the claim in an appeal, warning that the Love and Thoms decision barring the deportation of Aboriginal non-citizens threatened the principle that Aboriginal sovereignty did not survive the colonisation of Australia. In submissions lodged on Friday, the commonwealth also argued that Aboriginal people’s spiritual connection to the land does not create a “special relationship” to the commonwealth. The federal government has quietly agreed to allow the importation of unapproved rapid antigen tests for personal use amid shortages of approved kits. It comes as the Therapeutic Goods Administration reviews the effectiveness of the 23 tests approved for detecting Omicron. Experts have questioned whether a new $500 voucher scheme for NSW parents to access before- and after-school care will be enough to change behaviours altered by the pandemic. People are “sweltering in poorly insulated rentals, getting sick and sometimes even dying”, social services advocate says. No state in Australia mandates that a landlord must provide a sufficiently cool living environment. This is despite extreme heat killing more Australians than any other form of natural disaster. A party in Boris and Carrie Johnson’s flat is one of 12 events being investigated by the Metropolitan Police over alleged breaches of lockdown, it has emerged, as the Sue Gray report found “failures of leadership and judgment” in No 10. You can read Sue Gray’s report here. The world would be better protected against new Covid variants and there would be substantially fewer deaths in low and middle-income countries if rich nations donated half of their vaccine doses, new research suggests. Belgian civil servants will no longer need to answer emails or phone calls out of hours after the country became the latest in Europe to offer workers the right to disconnect. Defying all odds, Portugal’s ruling centre-left Socialists won an outright parliamentary majority in Sunday’s snap general election, securing a strong new mandate for the prime minister, Antonio Costa. Donald Trump was accused of “saying the quiet part loud” on Sunday night, when he protested that Mike Pence, his former vice-president, could have overturned his election defeat by Joe Biden. A British woman accused of fabricating claims of being gang-raped in a holiday resort on Cyprus has had the conviction overturned by the Mediterranean island’s supreme court. A booming online industry specialising in fake passports with official visas and travel stamps is offering people with links to Islamic State the opportunity to leave Syria and travel onwards to the UK, EU, Canada and the US, a Guardian investigation has found. Midnight Oil drummer Rob Hirst relives the anarchic closing night of a legendary Sydney live music venue in 1980 that the band were astonished to survive. “For the hectic 50 minutes on stage all I could picture was this: smoking ruins, charred bodies and five musicians frozen rock-solid, still clutching their instruments,” writes Hirst. If you don’t have the energy for sweeping life changes, don’t worry. A few small tweaks can add up to a big difference. Here are all of our easy wins. Hu Xijin is China’s most famous propagandist. At the Global Times, he helped establish a chest-thumping new tone for China on the world stage – but can he keep up with the forces he has unleashed? Representatives from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany met in Paris last Wednesday with the goal of de-escalating the crisis in Ukraine. Russia has now amassed more than 100,000 troops along its border with Ukraine, ramping up tensions in a conflict that has dragged on since 2014. The Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth, walks Michael Safi through some of the possible outcomes should the Russian military invade Ukraine, and explains what kinds of diplomatic off-ramps might be available to tamp down the crisis.

One played out at Melbourne airport, in a refugee detention hotel and on the front of activists’ T-shirts. The other took place on tennis courts, and it is by virtue of the latter’s quality that the former will not dominate the collective memory. Serves, shadows and selfies.

More than one in five regular blood donors have been unable to attend appointments over the past few weeks due to being in isolation or unwell with Covid, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Australia’s medical regulator is considering lifting a ban on blood donations from people who lived in Britain in the 1980s and 1990s as a result. Scott Morrison addresses the National Press Club.

2/1/2022,"Scotland Yard detectives investigating alleged lockdown-breaking parties in Whitehall have obtained more than 300 photographs and 500 pages of documents showing what Sue Gray’s inquiry believes to be potential rule-breaking. Police said they had received photographic and digital evidence from Gray’s inquiry, and are racing to work out who will be asked to admit their guilt and accept a fine.  The Guardian understands that the images include photos taken at parties and those taken from security-system cameras showing when people entered and exited buildings. The photographs also include data showing who was where and when, all of which can establish guilt or innocence and whether the threshold for issuing a fine has been met. In addition, the dossier passed to the Metropolitan police by the Gray inquiry includes screenshots of WhatsApp messages about parties, as well as emails about the gatherings. One incident under criminal investigation is a gathering in Johnson’s flat on 13 November 2020 at which it is believed his wife, Carrie Johnson, was present. The Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, upon announcing the police intervention last Tuesday, said her force would tackle “the most serious and flagrant” rule breaches. Police may want to question Mrs Johnson and the prime minister, who was by his own admission at two events in Gray’s report that are now under investigation by Scotland Yard. These are the May 2020 garden party, followed days later by a birthday gathering with cake for Johnson in the cabinet room. The prime minister says he attended both only briefly. The Met’s special enquiries team is investigating 12 parties on eight separate dates. Detectives will match the evidence from Gray’s dossier, gather its own, and match that against the Covid rules in place at the time. In a statement, the Met said: “We are now reviewing it at pace to confirm which individuals will need to be contacted for their account. This prioritisation will include reviewing all the material from the Cabinet Office, which includes more than 300 images and over 500 pages of information.” The Met also defended its decision to ask Gray to withhold key detail of the worst breaches. It is the force’s third attempt at an explanation after a barrage of criticism. The decision led Gray to pull extensive detail from her report about the clearest prima facie breaches, which pose the gravest danger to Johnson’s grip on power. The Met said it did not want those it is treating as suspects lying because they knew what detectives had, as well as wanting to avoid witnesses’ memories being corrupted by extensive recitation of details if Gray’s full report had been made public. The Met said: “The reason this request is necessary is that in any investigation officers seek independent accounts from each individual, as free from the influence of others’ recollections as possible. “Officers would also seek to avoid providing details of their investigation in advance to those they contact, so that individuals are not tempted to shape their accounts according to what is in the public domain.” Those who contest any decision by the Met that they should face a fine will have their case decided in a magistrates court. One issue is that the public may never know who has been interviewed as a suspect under caution – which now could include the prime minister and his wife – nor who is issued a fine. Police rules say people should only be named when they are charged, except in rare circumstances. Furthermore, the Met has not been naming those issued with fines for breaking Covid laws.",News/UK news,Met police given over 300 photographs from Sue Gray inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/31/met-police-photographs-documents-sue-gray-inquiry

Friends since their 2012 collaboration Cockiness (Love It) and an official couple since early 2021, the his and hers looks are perfect – Rihanna in loose-fit ripped jeans and Rocky wearing a Carhartt jacket and vinyl pants.

2/1/2022,"Vodafone is 30 years old but the high point for its shareholders, remarkably, came 20 years ago – in the days when mobile phones were new and exciting. The group had just completed its daring and record-breaking acquisition of German group Mannesmann. Its share price hit 400p and the UK seemed to have a global success on its hands. Since then, Vodafone’s tale has been one of many more rounds of deal-making, but mostly to try to keep up with a telecoms industry where investment demands only seem to get bigger, especially when fast-fibre comes along to complicate the fixed line-versus-mobile balance.  There was a false dawn in 2013 when Vodafone sold its US assets to Verizon at the splendid price of £100bn. However, a few of the resulting purchases in Spain and Germany (again) now look to have been done at prices that were too rich. The group’s returns have been below its cost of capital for more than a decade, calculate Credit Suisse’s analysts. The share price lost touch with 200p around 2018, just before a hefty dividend cut. The price is now 130p. So, yes, this is fertile territory for an activist investor. Swedish-based group Cevian Capital hasn’t yet declared its stake or its ambitions, but its arrival will be welcomed by other shareholders. The popular diagnosis is that Vodafone is too damn complicated. At BT, shareholders (finally) know what they’re getting: a bet on UK fibre rollout and 5G. Vodafone’s pan-European business, by contrast, is a mish-mash of wholly owned operations, majority owned businesses and 50-50 joint ventures. Add the African Vodacom operation plus Turkey and the setup still looks like a sprawling empire. It wouldn’t matter if overall revenues were flying, but they’re not. To be fair to chief executive Nick Read, he has done 17 deals in three-and-a-bit years at the helm, with the aim of simplifying. Peripheral assets in New Zealand, Malta and elsewhere have been sold. He has separated a German-based masts and towers business and given it a listing in Frankfurt (Vodafone retains 82%) to pave the way for future combinations. He has also stopped the financial pain in India. None of it, though, has reawakened the share price. Redburn’s telecoms analysts offered 10 ideas for transformation, most of which can be filed under backing your best markets. “Imagine selling towers, Netherlands and Spain and using that money to gain more scale in Italy and the UK and to turbocharge Germany,” it says. Yes, that would be a cleaner pitch. Easier said than done, though. The problem with fantasy mergers and acquisition ideas is that regulators often view life differently. Four mobile networks have traditionally been seen as the minimum within a European country to guarantee consumer-friendly competition. Has a pandemic that highlighted the critical role of telecoms infrastructure made regulators more inclined to smile upon consolidation? Hard to know, but this is the moment to test the thesis. A combination of Vodafone and Three in the UK, for example, looks obvious. But there are also factors within Vodafone’s control. As ever when an activist arrives, the makeup of a company’s board is pushed into the spotlight. The long-serving UK non-executives at Vodafone are Sir Crispin Davis (ex-Reed Elsevier), Dame Clara Furse (ex-London Stock Exchange) and David Nish (ex-Standard Life). That collection scores well on the knighthood and damehood count, but it’s hard to spot the telecoms expert. Newish chairman Jean-François van Boxmeer would be well-advised to add some clout. In terms of general strategic direction, it may turn out that Cevian and Vodafone’s management aren’t a million miles apart. Read has been singing the simplification song more loudly recently, as well as appealing to regulators to ease up. Execution, though, remains the frustration. A kick, if that’s what Cevian is about to deliver, looks deserved. We’re still waiting for the government’s big idea on how to alleviate customers’ energy bills when the price cap is hiked, but they’re clearly waking up at the Treasury. A measure quietly introduced last week is aimed at any energy supplier thinking of playing fast and loose by selling its valuable hedges on gas-purchase contracts for a tidy profit and then letting the company fail. If you do that, says the Treasury, you’ll be hit with a 75% levy on the profits under a new “public interest business protection tax”. It’s a sensible deterrent. It is also yet another thing that neither the government, nor hapless regulator Ofgem, ever contemplated in happier days. The models weren’t designed for a gas price crisis, which is one reason why the energy supply industry is in such a mess.",News/Business,An activist investor could be just what Vodafone needs,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/31/an-activist-investor-could-be-just-what-vodafone-needs
