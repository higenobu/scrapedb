12/29/2021,"It is not the case that followers of Scottish football gaze enviously at the Premier League. Camera phones capturing goal celebrations and public investment funds bearing gifts mean Scots revel in their own authenticity. It may be thud and blunder but it is our thud and blunder. Recent days, though, have seen wistful glances across the border. After Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, implemented a limit of 500 people at outdoor sporting events the Scottish Professional Football League’s board took the unusually smart decision to expedite their top-flight winter break. At what traditionally is a hectic, joyous time it was deemed better to close the gates. In a stark divergence between UK and Scottish policy, 52,178 watched Newcastle draw with Manchester United on Monday. Few face masks were seen. Leicester’s defeat of Liverpool had more than 30,000 in attendance. Presuming Burnley reach Old Trafford on Thursday, the crowds will likely top 70,000. If Celtic Park and Ibrox were open for business, 500 would be the cap. The same, that is, as East Fife’s Bayview.  As a grim backdrop sits record numbers of Covid-19 cases. England, not Scotland, is the outlier given multiple European countries have reverted to closed-door football. Sturgeon was perfectly correct in pointing towards pressure on emergency services – especially with Old Firm, Edinburgh and Dundee derbies at new year – as applied by football. Still, Jason Leitch, Scotland’s national clinical director, drew criticism for the implementation of a blanket figure of attendees. “Of course you have to draw the line somewhere, we’ve drawn it at a variety of points over the last little while,” he said. “It’s very difficult to choose a number, you can either choose zero, 10,000 or somewhere in between. It’s a judgment based on trying to keep the risk as low as you possibly can but the alternative is just to close them down completely.” There is little confidence that Scotland will revert to anywhere close to full grounds when the Premiership restarts on 17 January. Should England plough on, and this also looks likely, the issue will rise on the radar of politicians. It would seem odd but maybe both the UK and Scottish government are correct in decision making based on their own scientific advice. The trouble is, the public cannot properly assess the respective stances. Covid spread linked to or around football matches has never been properly and consistently detailed. There also appears to have been a subtle shift in public attitudes; the shortage of empty seats at major games would suggest some fans do not consider attending matches to be as high risk now as they did previously. The notion that sport and politics must never mix was deeply flawed even before a pandemic left those in government making calls as heavily impacted this particular sector. The overlap is now intriguing. Make the basic point on social media about a huge gap in strategy between England and Scotland on this matter and – trust me – the reaction from people with diametrically opposed constitutional views is epic. Devolution means public health decisions can be taken outside of Westminster. Some argue along the basic lines of Scotland being a separate country, as means separate rules. To others, it is incongruous that St James’ Park can host more than 50,000 when 90 minutes up the east coast mainline major grounds are bolted shut. Football fans in Newcastle, Liverpool, Manchester or Sheffield surely behave no differently to those in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee or Aberdeen. There is even a regularly large influx from Scotland to the major English grounds, as is continuing via trains and supporters’ buses. Rangers fans with a strong sense of unionism will cite crowd curbs as typically of the Scottish National Party’s tyranny. A group of Celtic fans, who already felt oppressed by police, have recently displayed banners making their disquiet towards the Scottish government perfectly plain. While this anger from generally young men may be misdirected, it is perfectly easy to comprehend. Not only was there at least an insinuation of normal life post-vaccine, crowds got back into Scottish football grounds before that privilege was snatched away again. There will inevitably be a percentage of Scottish football fans who are conflicted; as staunch supporters of Sturgeon’s party while frustrated or angry that they cannot enjoy their weekend pastime of choice. Football fans have a habit of exaggerating their sport’s importance but if disquiet in Scotland spreads in meaningful form to the electorate, Sturgeon is bound to take note. “These decisions are a fine balance but the public are slightly frustrated at the contradictory and inconsistent nature of what these rules mean,” says Ian Murray, the shadow secretary of state for Scotland. “A lot of people feel that going into a controlled circumstance, like a large outdoor event, with a negative lateral flow as part of the rules is a much safer place than crowding into houses or pubs to watch the football.” Under the Scottish covid passport project, proof of that lateral flow result or vaccine status was required for crowds of 10,000 or more. The scheme was very loosely policed. It is not at all easy to source those in high office of Scottish football who are willing to berate the present situation. Theirs is a wise position. In the early stages of last season, with stadia closed, representatives of the SPFL and Scottish FA embarked upon routine whinging about what they perceived as unfair treatment. Not only did this look callous, it angered government. Scottish football has enjoyed benefits not available to other sectors as Covid has flipped society on its head. Season tickets have been sold, television contracts remained intact and the Old Firm have continued to trade players for millions of pounds. The Scottish government gave not inconsiderable financial support to SPFL clubs. Football alone cannot play the victim this time; 70,000 watched Harlequins’ defeat of Northampton at Twickenham on Saturday. Glasgow Warriors against Edinburgh on Monday, postposed after a Covid outbreak in the home ranks, would have been spectator-free. The much-used argument that football grounds should remain packed simply because shopping centres are is undermined on grounds of behaviour. The masked shoppers who spend Saturday afternoons in Next or Holland & Barrett are not prone to leaping all over each other in wild celebration after bursts of community singing. “A crowd of 500 at a Rangers game compared to a crowd of 50,000 which would normally be of that order makes a very, very clear significant point that we have to reduce dramatically the level of social interaction,” explained John Swinney, Scotland’s deputy first minister. The anomaly is not specific to Scotland. Close to 10,000 took in this week’s Belfast derby between Linfield and Glentoran. Fans of Cardiff City and Swansea City are locked out of their grounds but more than 20,000 have scope to attend Bristol City v Queens Park Rangers just a short hop along the M4 on Thursday evening. Berwick Rangers by geographical quirk could presumably admit as many people as they like to the new year’s day, Scottish Lowland League, visit of Bonnyrigg Rose. As Scotland’s top-flight clubs pray for similar opportunity, they need the latest of Boris Johnson’s high-risk games to pay off. Should it not, football supporters in England have been thrust into wholly dangerous territory. Reckless England or over cautious Scotland?

12/29/2021,"For many people, the thin red line on a pregnancy test ushers in countless changes. You change what you eat and drink, how you exercise and socialize and sleep, and keep careful track of what medications you should and shouldn’t take. But for many Americans, there’s one choice they largely haven’t made: getting vaccinated.  About 22% of pregnant people in the US have gotten the Covid shots, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with another 18% who got vaccinated prior to pregnancy. That means three in five pregnant Americans have no protection provided by vaccination as the country faces an enormous surge in cases. “One of the most important things you can do as a pregnant person to protect yourself these days, in terms of the pandemic and generally, is to get vaccinated against Covid-19,” said Neel Shah, chief medical officer of Maven clinic and assistant professor of obstetrics at Harvard Medical School. “And yet, that’s not what we’re seeing.” In fact, studies show that pregnant people risk more severe disease with Covid-19, and the illness frequently leads to a bevy of complications – including preeclampsia and premature birth. If you have Covid-19 during pregnancy, you are two to three times more likely to have premature birth, fetal growth restrictions, and hemorrhaging, according to a new study published on Monday in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. A Covid-19 diagnosis increased the risk of having a very premature baby by 60%, according to another study. These early births are particularly alarming because they “carry the highest risks of infant mortality and adverse outcomes”, the authors wrote, and the babies tend to face longer stays in the neonatal ICU with more severe illness. People who were Covid-positive when they delivered their babies were twice as likely to have stillbirths, a study from the CDC study found. And pregnant women with Covid were 22 times more likely to die than women without the illness, according to a study in 18 countries before vaccines were available. “The maternal mortality rate in our country has gone up year after year, and it’s expected to continue to go up in part because of the pandemic,” Shah said. In New York last week, Tsion Firew, a physician and assistant professor of emergency medicine at Columbia University, cared for pregnant women with Covid-19 in the emergency room. They were unvaccinated and their fevers soared, their bodies ached and their oxygen levels dropped. None of these patients needed to be admitted to the intensive care unit, but that’s happened during previous surges. “We’ve seen many unvaccinated women ending up in the ICU, going into cardiac arrest, or having severe hypoxia and needing to be intubated,” she said. And that can cause the babies to be born early, facing their own illnesses and complications. But Firew understands why many parents-to-be are hesitant about vaccination. “They’re worried – they don’t know what might happen to their unborn baby with the vaccine,” she said. She was hesitant at first, too, when the vaccines became available a year ago. Firew was 22 weeks pregnant, and she was concerned that pregnant people weren’t included in the clinical trials. After speaking with her doctor and looking into the data, though, she saw that some people in the trial had become pregnant and carried those pregnancies safely. She got the vaccine, and she’s glad she could protect herself and her baby – including by passing antibodies from the vaccine first during pregnancy and then through breast milk, which contains helpful antibodies and T-cells. Firew’s baby, now almost a year old, cooed in the background happily as her mother spoke. The spurge in cases makes it all the more urgent that everyone who is eligible get vaccinated, Firew said. “​​Now that we have a new variant that’s spreading like a wildfire, everyone is at higher risk compared to prior ones. When you have so many risks that are threatening you, I think it’s important to be protected by vaccination and all the other [precautions].” Yet there are many reasons why hesitations linger. Shah’s company conducted a survey of 500 people across the country on their reasons for not getting vaccinated. The biggest reason was that they didn’t realize vaccines – and now boosters – are recommended during pregnancy. “The public health messaging was really pretty muddled,” Shah said. And some respondents said their close friends and families, and even some medical providers, had recommended against the shots. “It wasn’t just that it was ambiguous information,” Shah said. “They were being told that they should not get vaccinated, and in many cases from trusted sources.” Simply encouraging pregnant patients to get vaccinated is often not enough. They need to have questions answered, especially around the safety of the vaccines. According to a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, six out of 10 respondents who haven’t yet gotten the vaccines worried about their safety, despite an abundance of data showing the vaccines are safe and effective. “It can’t just be like, ‘You need to do this.’ We need to provide people with a basis for why it’s safe,” Shah said. “People are sort of struggling and anxious at baseline, and then don’t have that clarity.” Boosters are also an important tool for protecting pregnant people, especially with the winter wave that is gaining force. “With Omicron in the mix in particular, it seems very, very clear that there is an enormous protective benefit to getting a third vaccine,” Shah said. “Given those stakes and given those risks, again, the most important thing they can do to protect themselves is to get vaccinated.”",News/US news,Covid vaccinations lag among pregnant Americans amid surge in cases,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/29/us-covid-vaccines-pregnancy
12/29/2021,"Electric cars have gone mainstream in Europe – they accounted for nearly a fifth of all car purchases in the UK last month. Yet one piece has been missing up to now: European batteries. That is now changing. On Tuesday night, Northvolt, a startup, produced its first lithium ion battery cell at a plant in northern Sweden. It is the first of a series of new factories that investors hope will allow Europe to carve out a big proportion of the electric vehicle market – and weaken the stranglehold built up by manufacturers in China, Japan and Korea.  The Northvolt Ett site will be the first European-owned plant to produce at so-called gigafactory scale. Gigafactories are generally considered to be those capable of producing enough batteries each year to provide about 15 gigawatt hours (GWh) of cumulative storage. Only two large battery factories are operational in Europe, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI), a battery data company: a factory in Wrocław, Poland, run by Korea’s LG, and another owned by Korea’s Samsung near Budapest in Hungary. Yet there are 25 gigafactories planned for the continent by 2030, according to BMI, as the industry races to keep up with soaring demand for electric cars. Nine of those are owned by Asian manufacturers, which control most of the global supply. The UK is arguably further behind the rest of Europe, with plans for only two gigafactories. One will be a major expansion of a small battery plant in Sunderland by the Chinese company Envision, while the Glencore-backed startup Britishvolt is attempting to secure funding for a homegrown rival in nearby Blyth. Local authorities in Coventry are trying to find a manufacturer for a third site at the local airport, but nobody has yet stepped forward – a situation that has cast a shadow over the prospects of the UK automotive sector as it strives to replace the declining internal combustion engine industry. Simon Moores, BMI’s chief executive, hailed Northvolt’s first cell as “Europe’s first gigafactory-era lithium ion battery”. Despite its startup status, Northvolt has gained heavyweight financial backing from Volkswagen, the world’s biggest car producer, and the investment bank Goldman Sachs. Its $2.75bn (£2.1bn) funding round in June valued it at $12bn. Northvolt hopes to rapidly expand production at the plant at Skellefteå in northern Sweden to produce 60GWh a year – enough to supply batteries for a million electric cars. Commercial deliveries will start in the new year. The startup already boasts contracts worth $30bn with big European companies including the carmakers BMW, Volkswagen, Volvo Cars and Polestar, the truck manufacturer Scania, and the energy storage firm Fluence. Carmakers are belatedly ramping up electric vehicle production to meet tightening emissions targets as well as the challenge from their US rival, Tesla, which has built its own battery and car plant in Berlin. Peter Carlsson, Northvolt’s chief executive and co-founder, said the production of the lithium ion battery on Tuesday represented“a great milestone”. “Of course, this first cell is only the beginning,” he said. “Over the course of the coming years, we look forward to Northvolt Ett expanding its production capacity greatly to enable the European transition to clean energy.”",News/Business,Northvolt rolls out Europe’s first ‘gigafactory-era’ car battery,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/29/northvolt-rolls-out-europes-first-gigafactory-era-car-battery
12/29/2021,"Very soon we will mark the first anniversary of 6 January 2021 – a day when American democracy died a little. Just hours after the “Stop the Steal” attack on the Capitol, more than 100 congressional Republicans refused to certify the results of the election. Donald Trump had lost, but he had also won – the “big lie” had firmly taken root. Since then the threats to US democracy have metastasized. Over the last few months, a new threat has emerged, one which few Americans – much less people abroad – are even aware of. It’s a story that has been under-reported and yet the future of US democracy may depend on it being told.  With your help, we can tell this story in 2022. Far from signalling the end of Trump, 6 January proved he was only getting started. According to a recent Quinnipiac poll, 77% of Republicans believe there was “widespread fraud”. (Earlier this month an Associated Press investigation into the 2020 election found just 475 cases of voter fraud in six key battleground states. Joe Biden won those states by 311,257 votes.) And yet, Republicans exercised by the ex-president’s lies about electoral fraud are now systematically targeting elected offices across the US. But not any elected office – specifically positions that have oversight of elections. They are pursuing positions of high office, such as secretary of state, but also lower-ranking county-level offices across the states, from Michigan to Pennsylvania and from Texas to Georgia. This is an entirely new threat. This is not voting suppression or gerrymandering (though those remain huge democratic obstacles which we continue to report on). What is now taking shape across America is the machinery necessary to steal an election. Free and fair elections are under threat. Last week, Jocelyn Benson, the Democratic secretary of state in Michigan, said about Trumpists targeting official positions with electoral oversight: “This is a five-alarm fire. If people in general, leaders and citizens, aren’t taking this as the most important issue of our time and acting accordingly, then we may not be able to ensure democracy prevails again in 2024.” We believe it is the most consequential political story of our time. And one of the most important stories to tell in 2022. You can help us do that. This story is playing out all over the country, from gubernatorial races in Georgia (where Trump is supporting a candidate, David Perdue, who recently said he would not have certified the results of the 2020 election) to lower-ranking offices in Pennsylvania where “Stop the Steal” supporters have triumphed in races to become judges of elections in their local precincts. Yes, a “Stop the Steal” supporter will be overseeing the 2024 election. Earlier this month, the president hosted a Summit for Democracy intended to draw attention to the erosion of democratic norms around the world as global authoritarianism is on the rise. But Biden and the Democrats need to pay more attention to the threats closer to home. As a news organisation headquartered in the UK we have conversations with friends and colleagues abroad almost daily and they look on in disbelief at what is happening in the US. Many believed that Trump’s departure would signal a return to some kind of normal; instead, US democracy is in significantly greater danger than it was a year ago. This is a story that needs telling, to both a domestic and international audience. America is facing down the barrel of a ballot-box coup. As the writer and academic Lawrence Douglas wrote recently in the Guardian: “Republican state lawmakers have weaponized the lies about the 2020 election and the 6 January insurrection to gain control over the local administration of elections. By the time Congress tallies the electoral votes on 6 January 2025, the putsch could be complete.” Thanks to the generosity of our readers, we have already reached our $1.25m year-end fundraising goal. But it’s not too late to give in order to help us dedicate resources to this essential reporting.
