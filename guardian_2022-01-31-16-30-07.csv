1/31/2022,"Aged care workers will receive two pre-election bonus payments worth up to $800, as the government seeks to claw back public support for its troubled pandemic response. Ahead of a major speech at the National Press Club on Tuesday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has announced that the bonus will be paid to more than 230,000 aged care workers in government-subsidised home care and to residential aged care staff providing “direct care, food or cleaning services”.  The first payment will be made this month, and the second in early May. The latest date the election can be held is 21 May. The bonus payments will be modelled on the $393m aged care workforce retention payments that were granted in the early stages of the pandemic in 2020. The bonus will be paid on a pro rata basis depending on hours worked, with each payment worth a maximum of $400. The $209m package comes as the government begins the political year reeling from a public backlash to its response to the Omicron wave of the virus over summer, fuelled by a shortage of rapid antigen tests, soaring case numbers, and workforce and supply chain disruptions caused by the mass furloughing of staff. A Newspoll published in the Australian on Monday showed support for the government tracking at its lowest level since the leadership spill in September 2018 that saw Malcolm Turnbull deposed as leader, with Labor ahead of the Coalition 56% to 44% on a two-party-preferred basis. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the “message” in the Newspoll was that “Australians continue to do it tough through Covid”. “The pandemic has gone on for two years. Omicron disrupted many people’s summer plans, holiday plans, and there is that frustration out there. So we’ll continue to work hard for the public, both on the health front and on the economic front,” Frydenberg told ABC radio. But the treasurer was also forced to defend the government’s economic response, after the NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, said on Sunday he was “disappointed” the federal government had not matched its latest business support package. In response, Frydenberg said the government “can’t just keep writing the cheques”. “You actually have to take some tough decisions. And now with the vaccination rates well over 90%, Australia is well placed … to live safely with Covid, despite the challenges it poses.” Talking up the country’s health outcomes to mark the start of the political year, Morrison will tell the press club on Tuesday that the government payment would support the aged care workforce “to continue to care for older Australians through the pandemic”. “None of our health outcomes would be possible without the hard work, long hours and dedicated care offered by our frontline health and aged care workforce,” Morrison will say, according to draft excerpts of his speech released to the media on Monday. “Their resilience over the past two years has been inspiring.” The move to target the aged care workforce comes amid widespread frustration within the sector about the government’s preparedness for the latest Covid-19 outbreak, with providers concerned about the lack of rapid antigen tests available for surveillance testing, and the pressures being placed on an already stretched workforce. Morrison has insisted that the commonwealth has fulfilled its responsibilities to the sector by providing rapid tests to residential aged care facilities when needed to contain outbreaks, and by focusing on the vaccine booster program for residents and workers. The latest figures from the Department of Health show there are 23,900 active Covid cases within the aged care system across 1,261 residential aged care facilities. This includes more than 14,000 staff and close to 9,000 residents. Since July, there have been 657 Covid deaths within these facilities. The health and aged care minister, Greg Hunt, on Monday said Australia had recorded one of the lowest death rates in the sector in the world, and said that 60% of the reported deaths were people already in palliative care. He said that as of Monday, 99% of residential aged care facilities had taken part in the government’s booster program, despite criticism that the rollout had been too slow to prevent deaths. He also said the Newspoll figures reflected the fact that it had been “a difficult period” for many Australians and the country had not been “unspared” by Omicron. “I think that it is important to acknowledge, to understand and to recognise from a government perspective, our task, our mission is to continue to work to keep Australians safe,” Hunt said. “We recognise the challenges and the hardship people have faced, but also when it actually comes to keeping Australians safe, the Coalition and the prime minister Scott Morrison are the ones that, in our view, are best placed to do that.” ",News/Australia news,Aged care workers to get bonus payments as Morrison government tries to claw back support,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/31/aged-care-workers-to-get-bonus-payments-as-morrison-government-tries-to-claw-back-support
1/31/2022,"The strange disappearance of a Northern Territory man who went missing from the tiny town of Larrimah in 2017 will be re-examined, with an inquest into his suspected death to resume later this year. Patrick “Paddy” Moriarty, 70, has not been seen since the night he left the pub in Larrimah – which has a population of 11 people – and set off for home on his quad bike with his kelpie.  On Monday, the NT coroner’s office confirmed the inquest into his suspected death would resume in April, almost four years after the coroner, Greg Cavanagh, adjourned the case indefinitely – reportedly because he had spoken to almost everyone he could from the town. Moriarty had feuded with other locals in the remote town south of Katherine before he vanished. The nature of his disappearance captivated audiences with the case the subject of a documentary, a podcast series and a book. NT police said last year they suspected Moriarty had been murdered and announced a $250,000 reward for information. “The investigation remains focused on establishing what happened to Paddy, where he might be and who is responsible,” Det Sgt Matthew Allen, who was leading the investigation, said in a statement at the time. “We continue to follow up information from the public and a number of people have been eliminated from our inquiries. Somebody knows what happened. A 70-year-old man and his dog don’t just disappear from a tiny outback town. Police believe Paddy has been murdered.” The reward was for information leading to the location of Moriarty’s body and the conviction of the person or people responsible for his death, Allen said. “The case will only be closed when it is solved. Even if you don’t think you have any useful information, the smallest clue might be just what we need to resolve this case.”",News/Australia news,Inquest to resume into suspected murder of man who vanished from remote NT town,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/31/inquest-to-resume-into-suspected-of-man-who-vanished-from-remote-nt-town
1/31/2022,"Victoria’s chief health officer is yet to provide advice to the state government on whether a third Covid-19 vaccine dose should be mandated, despite the premier flagging the change. Daniel Andrews has for some time called for national cabinet to change the definition of “fully vaccinated” to mean three doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, rather than two.  “I’ll follow the advice of experts and I think we’re very close to a situation where the relevant federal authorities will determine that three doses is what’s considered fully protected. As for fourth and fifth, let’s wait and see how this goes,” he told reporters on Sunday. “There has already been some mandating done for third doses and there will be more. Whether that’s popular or not, that’s not my concern. Politics doesn’t work against this virus, you’ve got to make difficult decisions, and then push forward from there.” But speaking at the first public hearing of Victorian state parliament’s pandemic declaration accountability and oversight committee on Monday, the state’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton said he and the premier had not discussed revising existing mandates. “I haven’t been requested to provide advice on broader vaccine mandates at this stage,” Professor Sutton said. “When and if I get a request from the (health) minister for advice on those potential measures, I’ll be very happy to assess the epidemiological situation of that time and to provide my recommendations on how that might change, if at all.” Asked by Liberal MP Georgie Crozier if the premier was “making these decisions without your input”, Sutton replied: “I don’t believe there have been any decisions made”. On 10 January, acting chief health officer Ben Cowie’s advice was that a mandate for third doses was not yet required. “I have considered a consistent one-size-fits-all approach to vaccination mandates for all workforces and even for the general community but, at this time, I do not consider this to be a proportionate response,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Victorians are voluntarily accessing booster doses at high numbers.” As of Monday, 38.9% of Victorians aged over 18 have had three vaccine doses. Sutton said authorities will have to consider introducing further booster shots if there is evidence of waning immunity about six to 12 months after the third dose. “It may well be the case of a booster at an annual interval or something akin to that the same way that we’re challenged with flu virus and the need for an annual booster for everyone,” he said. The new cross-party parliamentary committee was set up when the state’s new pandemic-specific legislation came into effect late last year. Under the laws, the responsibility for declaring a pandemic and imposing public health restrictions has been transferred from the chief health officer to the premier and health minister respectively. As well as reviewing pandemic orders, the committee can recommend changes and refer matters to Victorian ombudsman Deborah Glass for investigation. Sutton told the committee the health minister must seek his advice before issuing new restrictions but does not necessarily need to follow it. He said the decision to increase crowds for the Australian Open finals from 65% capacity to 80% was made by health minister Martin Foley alone. “I had a request for a public health view and I provided no recommendation for or against. I said that it was primarily a matter of social licence and social considerations as a really significant public event,” Sutton said. The public health team was also not involved in the decision to grant world mens no 1 tennis player Novak Djokovic a medical exemption to play, he said. Sutton is also confident the state has reached the peak of Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations. “I think that peak will look bumpy, it will have up and down days but it won’t significantly increase from the position we are in right now,” he said. However, he has no plans “at this point in time” to change current recommendations to work from home. “Children (are) returning to school today … and we do expect transmission to occur as a result,” he said. “The recommendation to work from home will help counteract that because kids going back to school are going to slow the decrease in case numbers that we might otherwise see.” Victoria recorded 10,053 new Covid-19 infections and eight deaths on Monday, while there are 889 people in hospital battling the virus. The committee intends to hold further public hearings throughout the year.",News/Australia news,Daniel Andrews and Brett Sutton yet to discuss Victorian mandate for third Covid vaccine dose,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/31/daniel-andrews-and-brett-sutton-yet-to-discuss-victorian-mandate-for-third-covid-vaccine-dose
1/31/2022,"Could there be gold in them streaming hills? Scrolling through your preferred film service in search of something new but also good can make you feel like a crotchety wild west varmint panning through dreck in search of hidden treasure. It’s pleasing, then, that the sci-fi mining tale Prospect – a modest but gorgeously realised story of survival on a far-flung frontier – is a streaming gem where the characters are driven by the pursuit of gleaming gems.  On a remote alien forest moon where the mote-filled atmosphere is so hazardous it requires pressure suits and air filters to navigate, a stressed single father (Jay Duplass) drags his young daughter Cee (Sophie Thatcher) out on a high-risk prospecting expedition. After a hard landing in their cramped space-pod, the pair have a limited window to sniff out valuable organic gems. After three “cycles”, the interstellar gantry that dropped them off will be headed home. If they miss their lift they will be stranded in this lush wilderness with only a musket-like dart gun for protection. The gems are coddled in gloopy alien egg sacs but harvesting them is a nerve-jangling procedure requiring a steady scalpel hand: the dig sites are combustible and slicing a sac incorrectly causes the treasure to fizzle and spoil. The fact that the jittery dad seems to favour stimulant-infused chewing gum to push himself further does not fill you with confidence. Cee – who we first meet in a headphone-wearing reverie scribbling cryptic pictograms like a typically disaffected teen – seems sceptical about the whole thing even before her father reveals they are seeking a mythical bonanza nicknamed the Queen’s Lair. That is when Pedro Pascal moseys into frame as the rascally Ezra, and if there was any doubt that this was an old-fashioned western transposed to a sci-fi milieu, his highfalutin Deadwood cadences and languid low cunning snap everything into focus. Before long, it is just Ezra and Cee trying to survive “in the green”, having forged a tentative alliance based on survival. “A good partnership is only made so by candid discourse,” advises Ezra in one of his many folksy proclamations, but while they are literally tethered together for life support their alliance is a rickety one, especially when the verdant jungle might not be as uninhabited as first thought. If their slim chance of escape rests on trusting each other, there are a lot of confrontations and negotiations – as well as some teeth-sucking scenes of amateur field surgery – to get through first. The prickly human motivations of this pared-back story contrast with the woozy setting, a trippy but tangible alien forest that evokes the phantasmagoric mulch-land of Alex Garland’s Annihilation (another sci-fi marvel released in 2018). Prospect’s evocative effects work – including a throwaway shot of caterpillar made strikingly alien by some subtle CGI – is all of a piece with its frugal but evocative production design. Everything in Cee’s shabby space pod seems to have been created with a real-world purpose in mind. If you are the sort of person who pauses Alien to marvel at the design and iconography of the Nostromo’s various control panels there is similarly a ton to unpack here. The term “world-building” is sometimes used pejoratively to knock blockbuster movies that seem more interested in setting up potential sequels or spin-offs than telling their story. Prospect creates its own perfectly realised sci-fi snowglobe that manages to be aesthetically intriguing while never pulling too much focus from its life-or-death situation. The world seems real, and therefore so do the stakes. What makes Prospect really sing is the fractious chemistry between Cee and Ezra, the mismatched odd couple who slowly begin to appreciate each other’s hidden talents. Who knows if Jon Favreau or any of the other creative talent behind The Mandalorian saw Prospect on initial release and were struck by Pascal’s ability to communicate emotion even via two-way radio transmission in a bulky helmet. In any case, it now looks like a warm-up for his bounty-hunting breakout. His co-star Thatcher also recently joined the Star Wars universe as a cybernetic street punk in The Book of Boba Fett (although she has much more to do in the buzzy survivalist series Yellowjackets, where she plays the teen version of Juliette Lewis’s Natalie). That these two performers have gone on to higher-profile projects is unsurprising but it is unclear what Christopher Caldwell and Zeek Earl, Prospect’s writers/directors, are working on next. Whatever it is, I will greedily seek it out.

1/31/2022,"You sometimes hear it said, usually by those looking in from outside, that the literary world is a cosy, circle-jerking kind of place. Oh, if only they knew! Like any human zone where access to power is to be had, the book world is rife with cut-throat careerists, mafia-like cliques, group hierarchies, herd opinions, playground politics, backstabbing, arse-licking and all the other shades in venality’s rainbow. Indeed, it offers up so plump and unguarded a throat, it’s a surprise more blade-wielding satirists don’t lunge in and slit it right open. Going by her latest novel, the Argentine Pola Oloixarac is a writer whose default mode of interpreting the world is cynicism. While this carries some obvious limitations, it positions her well to dissect her industry’s pretensions and poke fun at its pieties. The success of Oloixarac’s first novel, Savage Theories, propelled her into the arena of world literature with its international festivals, prize committees, calculated postures and erotic intrigues. Her third novel, nimbly translated by Adam Morris, trains its satiric sights on this rarefied milieu.  When we first meet Mona’s titular protagonist, she is numbing herself with Valium and alcohol on a transatlantic flight from California, ignoring creepily insistent messages on her phone and fixing to masturbate in her window seat as she approaches her destination of Stockholm. Her purpose there is to attend an award ceremony for the prestigious Basske-Wortz prize, for which she has been nominated. A Peruvian whose debut novel won her the esteem of the Latin American left and inflated a literary reputation she secretly suspects is fraudulent, Mona has been trying to follow up with a ‘“terrifying, brilliant, and dangerous” second work, but “now the book was starting to eat her alive”. As she hobnobs in Sweden with her Arabic, Asian, Israeli and European counterparts, Mona reflects wryly on exoticism in both the cultural stock exchange of global literature and American academia (she has a scholarship at Stanford University). She arrived in the US “at a time when being a ‘woman of colour’… began to confer a chic sort of cultural capital”. On her application form, she listed her ethnicity as “Hispanic” and “Indigenous”, then added “Inca” for good measure, well aware that liberal America’s identity fetishism “offered her the opportunity to advance her career merely by being herself”. There is plenty of this kind of spiky scepticism in the first half of this short, enjoyable and flawed novel. Provocations abound. When each of the prize-nominated authors is invited to give a speech, an Iranian egomaniac named Abdollah Farid devotes his to stripping the figure of the Muslim immigrant of its sentimental ruse, gleefully declaring that it is in fact Europeans who will have to learn to assimilate to Middle Eastern ways: ‘There are millions of us already living here, and millions more on the way… nobody will ever be able to stop it!’ The wind-up merchant Mona goes one further, deciding that the Islamification of the continent is a fait accompli, because no one will be able to convince its women not to keep flooding Europe — “that pregnant slut” — with hot Middle Eastern men. Mona is driven more by her sex drive than by artistic idealism and her stay at the prize meeting is punctuated by pornographic fantasies and Skype sex. She seems to grow concerned about the consequences of her caustic outlook, suggesting in a pre-coital dialogue that “‘it’s important… to treat each other well. Love each other… You don’t want to be the Mark David Chapman of your generation’s foetal avant-garde.” To which her handsome Nordic interlocutor adds: “I like where you’re going with this. Otherwise literary culture is nothing but a bunch of snipers scattered all over the world, each on their own rooftop, lining up their enemies in crosshairs of arguments and posturing…” Insofar as she sticks to such lit-world theorising and piss-taking, Oloixarac is on steady ground. Unfortunately, having set the narrative’s wheels in motion, she has no viable plan to guide the vehicle home. The novel’s credibility collapses in the final third. A lazy appeal to Nordic mythology for unearned profundity rings jarringly false, while a gesture towards an exploration of male on female violence never follows through. Grasping for gravitas by appeal to secondhand signifiers and conscious symbolism, Oloixarac overburdens a novel that might more effectively have kept its focus on the egos and libidos of the literary set. In doing so, she falls face first into a condition with which she would be swift to diagnose her characters: pretentiousness. It’s a shame that Mona is not both more fleshed out and tightly focused. In a literary culture swamped by clenched, worthy fiction and the writer as activist, her satirist’s misanthropy and taste for provocation are a tonic.

All the goods I have sent are well under the €45 (£37) that seems to be the threshold for paying VAT. But he always ends up having to collect the package from a depot and paying between €6 and €10. I have been using Royal Mail and printing my own labels and the CN22 customs declaration form. The most recent fee of €9 was for a paperback book, only worth £10.  How do I prevent these bills? GH, Sheffield I have received a lot of similar emails, mostly from people who sent Christmas gifts to recipients who ended up having to pay a fee before the carrier would release their item. It’s another post-Brexit disaster area, that even the Royal Mail struggles to explain. The situation is confusing as VAT is now payable on non-gifts arriving in the EU from the UK. In contrast, as I understand it, gifts valued below €45 are not subject to VAT or duties, and therefore there is no reason for extra fees. Royal Mail confirmed that your son has been wrongly charged and has refunded you for the December parcel, and another sent last week. It told you that the “gift” tick box on the CN22 customs form is being “misinterpreted” by EU carriers and it is addressing this with a “redesigned” form due at the end of the month.

1/31/2022,"The last song I streamedHerbie Hancock, Watermelon Man. My brother runs a gospel choir, he’s a jazzer. A lot of my musical education came from him. When I was listening to Shaddap You Face, he’d be listening to Buddy Rich, John Coltrane, the cool ones. He got me totally into Herbie Hancock. The first single I ever boughtThe one, the legendary BoRap: Bohemian Rhapsody. I had to go halves with my sister Coky. In 1975 I was seven and she was 12, and we each saved up 15p for it. We were obsessed. It got played so much, I’m amazed that the grooves on the record were still able to hold a needle. I think I’ve still got it somewhere.  The song I inexplicably know every lyric to“What’s-a matter you? Hey! Gotta no respect? What-a you t’ink you do, why you look-a so sad?” It’s Shaddap You Face, by Joe Dolce. An absolute ruddy classic, a sort of comedy song from 1980. I hated it and loved it. It was No 1. My dad started singing it. He found it ludicrous and, being Polish, I think he responded to the fact that it was a comedy song about somebody who wasn’t English. The song that is my karaoke go-toMy go-to would be I Love Rock’n’Roll by Joan Jett. I tend to be good with bloke parts, but I find it really suits my vocal range. If I’m doing karaoke, I want it to be pretty outstanding. If you are an absolutely incorrigible showoff like I am, it’s got to be a crowdpleaser with a good strong chorus. The best song to play at a partyI did this outrageous Zoom disco for my sister’s birthday last year. I mixed up some 90s dance anthems with old favourites: your Sister Sledge, your Chic. But the song that went down best, I think, was Flawless by the Ones. I put that on, and suddenly everybody was leaping in their little squares. The song I want played at my funeralThe entirety of the musical Jesus Christ Superstar, live. Live! It has to be a full musical cast, ideally in costume. It’s my favourite ever musical, and there’s some good religious messages in there. I think a funeral should contain some thoughtful, slightly more spiritual angles. The song I can no longer listen toMy girls have got really good musical taste now, but I have a slightly involuntary twitch whenever I hear a song from High School Musical. There’s some great tunes, don’t get me wrong, but when you’ve listened to them upwards of 70,000 times … The song that is my actual favouriteI’d try to pretend it was Skepta, or something really cool, but it’s Minnie Riperton – Les Fleurs. Absolute banger! I was delighted when Kae Tempest played it on 6 Music the other day. It’s kind of bombastic and dramatic, there’s a big, boldly drawn story going on.

1/31/2022,"It has been a long and painful month in the Florida legislature for opponents of the state’s Trumpist governor Ron DeSantis and his loyal band of rightwing Republicans. A slew of bills has advanced attacking everything from diversity rights, abortion protections and free speech in schools, in addition to a proposal that would legally shield white people from feeling “discomfort” over the state’s racist past. And last Wednesday, an anti-masker physician, hand picked by the governor and apathetic about the value of Covid-19 vaccines, was backed unanimously by a Republican senate panel as the next surgeon-general following a walk-out by Democratic politicians frustrated by Joseph Ladapo’s evasiveness.  To hear DeSantis tell it, the “freedom state” of Florida is merely following the will of a populist citizenry in defying the perceived tyranny of the federal government, determined to protect liberty in the face of a deadly pandemic that has claimed more than 64,000 of their fellow residents, and standing up against the “indoctrination” of children. Yet as the possible 2024 presidential candidate presses ahead with turning Florida into what critics see as his own conservative fiefdom – a de facto Trumpistan of the south with an “Orwellian-sounding” election police force – DeSantis is finding opposition beginning to harden. More of the state’s 21 million people, which elected him in 2018 by barely 32,000 votes, appears displeased at the creeping authoritarianism and is keen to show DeSantis – who will be seeking re-election in November – that Florida is not the solidly red state he believes it to be. Those voices come from parents, doctors, LBGTQ+ activists, proponents of voting rights and others who will be affected if many of the Republican bills, as expected, become law. “People do not like the authoritarian nature of this governor and the way that he has weaponized fear between his constituents to try to curry favor with his base,” said Brandon Wolf, development manager and spokesperson for Equality Florida. “And I think you’re going to see that show up at the polls. I know people get concerned that maybe Florida is gone forever. But let me tell you we fully intend to mobilize and show up for our communities in the election cycle.” Wolf pointed to several areas where he said DeSantis’s moves were gaining little traction. “Florida is a beautifully diverse state. I live in downtown Orlando, which has folks from all walks of life, different races, ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations, gender identities. We all live in this wonderful tapestry that is central Florida,” he said. “I can tell you that the things that concern people here are not the conversations that are happening in Tallahassee. That rent went up 29% in 2021, that Florida is leading the country in increases in housing prices, people are concerned the governor has essentially made Covid-19 a political battleground. “Yet the legislature is singularly focused on legislating as if they won by a margin of 99 to one in 2018, as if they have a total mandate by which they can control people’s lives. It’s disgraceful and disappointing.” The issues that Republicans see as a priority for Florida are red meat to DeSantis’s conservative base. They include the 15-week abortion ban bill, which received a chaotic hearing on Thursday, and moves to give parents more say over classroom curriculum and control of school libraries. In Polk county this week, education officials went from school to school pulling 16 books flagged by a conservative parents’ group as inappropriate, including Khaled Hosseini’s 2003 bestseller The Kite Runner. They include bills to strengthen the governor’s fierce anti-immigrant stance by locking out from state or local government business any company involved in the transportation of undocumented migrants. And two healthcare bills have been introduced in the Republican-dominated Florida legislature that opponents say further vilifies and isolates the LBGTQ community. One, touted as the vulnerable child protection act, would criminalize professionals who provide gender-affirming medical care to minors; the other would allow any medical professional the right to refuse treatment or procedures including gender affirming surgery or abortions on moral grounds. “It doesn’t deny their right to access that procedure, but also protects the individual who has a conscience reason they don’t want to perform it,” the bill’s sponsor, Republican state senator Dennis Baxley, told the Sun-Sentinel. The proposal that has caused perhaps the most outrage is the parental rights in education bill, the so-called Don’t Say Gay bill that would prohibit elementary schools from discussing sexuality and gender identity other than in an unspecified “age or developmentally appropriate” settings, and would allow parents to sue. “It’s going to effectively erase LBGTQ students and families and LBGTQ history by banning classroom discussion,” said Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democratic state representative who opposed the measure vigorously in the legislature. “If a fourth-grader wants to come into the classroom, they’ve written an essay about their two dads, they want to present that essay to the class to talk about who they are or who their family is, the school is going to shut it down?” Wolf, meanwhile, sees a straight line from the flurry of reactionary legislative action to DeSantis’s own political ambitions. “These bills don’t live in silos. It’s easy if you look from the outside to see this scattershot of legislation and see them as individualized, that an abortion ban may not be tied to the Don’t Say Gay bill, which may not be tied to the license to discriminate in healthcare bill,” he said. “But the truth is they are all connected. And the thing that connects them is the concerted attempt by Governor Ron DeSantis and his allies to push themselves to the right of Donald Trump and set DeSantis up to run for president in 2024. “In Florida you are free, but only free to do and say as you are told.” Lauren Book, a state senator representing parts of Broward, Florida’s bluest county, led a walkout of Democratic colleagues at this week’s confirmation hearing for the polarizing Ladapo as Florida’s surgeon general, after he repeatedly refused to say if vaccines were effective in the fight against Covid-19. His views appear to echo those of DeSantis, who has feuded often and loudly with the Biden administration over the pandemic, and banned mask and vaccine mandates in Florida. “21 million Floridians deserve more than a mouthpiece for the governor, than talking sound bites that sound good and suit a narrative,” Book told CNN. Her criticism was echoed by a group of prominent Florida physicians, who accused DeSantis and Ladapo of “espousing policies contrary to the evidence”. Jabari Hosey, president of the education advocacy group Families for Safe Schools, said that the actions of DeSantis and Republican allies, particularly in banning Covid safety measures, do not match the wishes of the majority of parents and guardians of Florida’s 2.7 million school-age children. “He’s representing a small, loud group of parents,” he said. “We feel omitted and it’s kind of a punch to the gut when he’s selecting small, far-right groups of folks that kind of determine his legislative decision making. “Creating these bills like Don’t Say Gay is a dog whistle, and also a suppression tactic, a way to force us not to talk about these things and therefore not accept them. It’s scary for us, parents who don’t agree with this, and we just really believe we are the majority and we want to move forward, not backwards.”",News/US news,‘Free to do as you are told’: Florida Republicans advance wave of draconian bills,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/31/florida-republicans-draconian-bills
1/31/2022,"A sweeping new bill with powerful bipartisan support in the US Senate would establish an inquiry into the country’s Covid-19 response similar to the 9/11 Commission, among other provisions aimed at preventing the next pandemic. The new Covid commission would inform the US response to future outbreaks as well as the current impact of the disease. The bill will be co-sponsored by Senator Patty Murray of Washington and Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, who plan to mark it up in committee in coming weeks.  “The pain of this pandemic is unforgettable, and we have a responsibility to make sure its lessons are unforgettable, too,” Murray said. The legislation, called the Prevent Pandemics Act, would lay the groundwork to enshrine new powers in federal health agencies. It would also require Senate confirmation to appoint the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and it would better outline the duties of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response, a position Burr created in a 2006 law on pandemic preparedness. Murray, chair of the Senate health committee, first raised the idea of a Covid commission in March 2020. “Because even back then it was clear: we have to learn from this pandemic to make sure we are never in this situation again,” she said on Thursday. In November 2021, another bipartisan group of senators – Dianne Feinstein of California, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Joni Ernst of Iowa – also introduced a bill to establish a Covid commission. This wider bill represents months of work across the aisle between Murray and Burr, the committee’s Republican ranking member. An independent taskforce would “conduct a comprehensive review of the federal Covid-19 response, fully account for consequential gaps and breakdowns in our response, and issue recommendations to correct them”, Murray said. In November 2019, the US was ranked first of 195 countries for pandemic preparedness in a report co-produced by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security – but it has consistently had one of the worst responses to the actual Covid-19 pandemic, said John Farmer Jr, the senior counsel for the 9/11 Commission and director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. “And there’s very little apparent effort to figure out exactly why it was so ineffective and what we can do in the future,” he said. Farmer was among those calling for an inquiry early in the pandemic, he said, “because it was clear that the United States’ response was almost completely ineffective in containing the pandemic and preventing future variants from emerging”. The US response involved “basically 50 governors going 50 different ways, and no one effectively containing the virus”, Farmer said. That happened in part because the president doesn’t have the authority under current law to establish temporary public health measures, even during a pandemic. Legislation such as the proposed bill could lay the groundwork for changing these laws, though such changes would be likely to face sharp scrutiny in a highly divided Congress. The 9/11 Commission was created by Congress soon after the September 11 terrorist attacks. It was independent and non-partisan, staffed with officials who had investigative power, funding and time to create an authoritative report. “Good reports are important because they create the historical record, and they can also inform how we respond to the crisis to avoid it happening again,” said Alan Rozenshtein, associate professor at the University of Minnesota Law School. Another reason to create a Covid commission would be to garner high-profile support from all branches of government, which could bolster public trust in institutions, Rozenshtein said. “Those are the benefits – if you can pull it off,” he said. Rozenshtein doesn’t believe it’s possible to create a report on Covid that accomplishes what the 9/11 Commission did, however. “It will be very rigorous and professional and it will produce an excellent report – but because that will be attacked the whole way through by Trump and his enablers in the Republican party, that report will not then have anything like the impact of the 9/11 Commission.” A Covid commission would surely face bipartisan scrutiny even if it finds bipartisan support, Rozenshtein and Farmer said. “I think any sitting administration is going to feel vulnerable to the conclusions of such a commission,” Farmer said. “This is such a calamitous response that I’m not sure that either administration is really going to want a close look at what went wrong.” At the same time, he added, “the public interest has to outweigh that kind of partisan consideration. “We failed, as a society and as a world, to contain Covid, and we really need to look at more effective ways to handle future pandemics – or we could be in worse shape the next time,” Farmer said.",News/US news,Sweeping bill on inquiry into US Covid response sees bipartisan support,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/30/us-covid-commission-bill-senate-bipartisan-support
1/31/2022,"Many websites offer ebooks and audiobooks at no cost. Project Gutenberg lists more than 67,000 out-of-copyright titles which can be read online or downloaded in a wide range of formats. Similarly, Librivox offers more than 16,000 audiobooks of old titles, read and recorded by volunteers all over the world.  BookBub (bookbub.com) has free and discounted downloads of some recently published books, particularly in categories like romance and thrillers, with regular email alerts about cheap titles in genres you’re interested in. Ebooks, audiobooks and comics can be borrowed for up to 14 days from the Internet Archive’s vast collection – you need to join OpenLibrary.org for free, and download an encrypted file. Many of the titles available are recently published books from 1,100 libraries all over the world. If only one copy of the book you want is available, it can only be borrowed for an hour and must be read on a web book reader interface. It is auto-renewed for another hour if you are still reading it. Your local library may also lend copies of ebooks, comics and audiobooks via your library card and an app, such as OverDrive, Libby or BorrowBox. You can then read your choice on a smartphone, tablet or a compatible e-reader like a Kobo, Nook, PocketBook or Tolino – Kindles are not supported. The books will disappear from your “shelf” in the app on the day they are due back, so you don’t have to worry about late fees. Websites such as Netgalley.com and edelweiss.plus offer “readers of influence”, such as book reviewers and bloggers, free access to review ebooks and audiobooks before they are published. These are sometimes referred to in the industry as “advanced reading copies” or ARCs. It’s up to the publisher to approve your request, which it will do based on your biography and your profile on sites like LinkedIn, Twitter and Goodreads. “Bookstamagrammers” and “booktubers” – influencers who post on Instagram and YouTube – are often able to access free books from publishers via these websites. If you’re prepared to review books on websites such as Amazon or Goodreads, Booksirens lets you request review copies directly from authors, publicists, as well as publishers. You may also have luck contacting publishers directly or authors who use the hashtag #ARCreaderswanted or #arcreaders on Twitter or Instagram. Almost 800 libraries have closed in Britain since the government began its austerity drive in 2010. If you want your local library to stay open, use it. Many allow members to borrow 10 to 20 books and audiobooks free of charge. Buying used is better for the environment and, often, your wallet. If you buy from a charity shop, you are also supporting a good cause. One of the greatest pleasures of browsing in charity shops is that you never know what you might find. But if you’re looking for a specific book, the Oxfam website sells thousands at bargain prices. For example, at the time of writing, a quick search for bestselling children’s author Jacqueline Wilson revealed 26 books for sale, with some newly released titles for just £1.49 (70% off the RRP). There are also some excellent bargains in “used books” on Betterworldbooks.com. It donates a book to someone in need for every one sold. Another option is to hunt down a title via bookcrossing.com. This lists free books that have been released “in the wild” for a stranger to find: search to see whether there’s one listed near you. If you do find it, log on to the website and report it’s been “caught”. More than 16,000 books are available on bookswap.co.uk. “There are lots of newly published books and books you can’t find anywhere else,” says Triin Vihur, a bookstagrammer (@wordchild) who works part-time as the site’s social media manager. You first need to list the books you are prepared to send to other users. You then get credits for posting them with a prepaid label (so it costs you nothing) and you can use these credits to request books from a different user. If that user agrees to send you their book, you must hand over your credit and pay £3.85 in postage and swapping fees £2.66 postage and a £1.19 swapping fee to receive the book. If you have lots of books you want to get rid of, swapping can be fun – and cost efficient. “Often, I find it cheaper to get books on bookswap.co.uk than other secondhand platforms,” says Vihur. She recommends requesting more than one book at a time from the same user, as you only pay one postage fee no matter how many are in each package. The carbon footprint of a book swap is lower, and she likes knowing that books she no longer wants are going to someone who is really keen to read them. It’s a very different experience from buying a secondhand book from an online seller, she says: “It gives a lot of joy.” Many independent bookshops have struggled to stay afloat during the pandemic and 31 have closed, according to the Booksellers Association. If you don’t have time to physically set foot in the doors, consider supporting them online via bookshop.org. This website will handle your sale and give any independent bookshop you nominate a 30% commission on the RRP of the book you buy. “The beauty of it is that the bookshop doesn’t have to touch the order. The book does not come off its shelves, it comes straight from our wholesale partner and is shipped directly to your home,” says UK managing director Nicole Vanderbilt. “The bookshop has none of the costs, hassle and time of packing your order and posting it. So, in addition to giving them an incremental income, we give them a lot of their time back to focus on the part of the job that they love, and are uniquely good at.” She says most books the site sells have 7% off the RRP and shipping is free if you spend over £40. “We try to give as much value as we can to the bookshop, who often don’t discount, while still making the prospect of buying online from us attractive, instead of from a place like Amazon,” she says. Second-class shipping – where you get your book in two to three days – is £2.99, irrespective of the size of your order, and first class, which takes one day, is £4.10.

1/31/2022,"Anew, cheaper alternative to the AirPods Pro is here – and it is also from Apple. The Beats Fit Pro have many of the same features but cost £40 less, are more workout-friendly than their cousins and work with Android, too. Priced at £199 ($199.99/A$299.95) they offer the same noise-cancelling as the AirPods Pro and features such as spatial audio virtual surround sound.  The Fit Pro essentially add a flexible silicone stabiliser “wing” to the top of last year’s Studio Buds. Once you twist the wing into the top of your ear they stay put even with the most vigorous of exercise, or you can wear them without the wing tucked in for more sedate listening. The top of the earbud protrudes a little from your ear and has a single multi-purpose “b” button which you press once, twice, thrice or press and hold to skip tracks, change sound modes or adjust the volume. The music pauses when you remove an earbud too. The earbuds clip magnetically into a flip-top case for charging and storage, which is like a mini version of the giant Powerbeats Pro case. It is a bit bigger than the best on the market but still just about fits in the money pocket of a pair of jeans. The earbuds last up to six hours of playback with noise-cancelling active between charges, which is two hours short of the best rivals but at least an hour longer than the Studio Buds and AirPods Pro. Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.0, SBC, AAC, H1 chip Battery life: six hours ANC playback (24 hours with case) Water resistance: IPX4 (splash resistant) Earbud dimensions: 30x 24 x 19mm Earbud weight: 5.6g each Charging case dimensions: 62 x 62 x 28.5mm Charging case weight: 55.1g Case charging: USB-C The Fit Pro sound really good, particularly for fitness-focused earbuds. They have a well-balanced and fully rounded sound that suits a variety of genres. They can produce deep notes with a thump when needed but the bass is kept from overriding the good treble and high notes. Vocals are excellent, instrument separation is good and they handle complex tracks well. They sound similar to Apple’s AirPods Pro, and slightly better than the Studio Buds, but can’t quite match the very best-sounding earbuds from Sony. It is a similar story for the noise-cancelling. The Fit Pro match the efficacy of the AirPods Pro, successfully reducing low rumbles, cars and fans, while struggling with higher-pitched noise such as the tapping of fingers on a keyboard. The ambient awareness mode is one of the more natural-sounding of those available, good for listening out for announcements or a quick conversation. In addition to standard stereo sound, the Fit Pro have Apple’s spatial audio virtual surround sound technology, thanks to their H1 chip. It makes the audio sound as if it is coming from a collection of speakers around you rather than directed straight down your ear canal, giving it a greater atmosphere. When used with Apple devices, the earbuds track the movement of your head and adjust the sound so that it is always centred on the screen in front of you. It works particularly well for movies and TV shows with a Dolby sound track but also works with music, too. It’s all very clever. Unlike Apple’s AirPods, the Fit Pro support some elements of spatial audio on Android, but not the head tracking and other advanced features. The same story exists for other features on Apple versus Android. The Fit Pro support the same instant pairing, seamless switching between devices, instant “Hey Siri” access to the voice assistant, battery status notifications and audio sharing with Apple gear as the AirPods. They are standard Bluetooth 5.0 earbuds and will connect just fine to most devices, including Windows PCs. But unlike Apple’s other earbuds, the Beats support some of the more advanced features on Android including instant pairing, battery status, customisable controls, firmware updates and the ear tip fit test using the Beats app. If you use a mix of Apple and Android gear, the Beats app on Android will not be able to “find” the earbuds unless you turn off Bluetooth on nearby iPhones or iPads. Call quality was really good for such compact earbuds: my voice sounded clear and natural with only a little background noise leaking through in loud environments. Apple expects the batteries to last more than 500 full charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% of their original capacity but they are not replaceable. While some minor bits of the earbuds are repairable, they scored a zero out of 10 on iFixit’s repairability scale. Apple offers a “battery service” for £76.44 or replacements costing £96.44 each. The earbuds and case are made from recycled plastic and rare earth elements but Apple does not publish environmental impact reports for accessories such as headphones. The company offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. The Beats Fit Pro cost £199 ($199.99/A$299.95). For comparison, the AirPods Pro cost £239, the AirPods 3 cost £169, the Beats Studio Buds cost £130, the Jabra Elite 7 Pro cost £199 and the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 cost £99. The Beats Fit Pro offer a slice of the earbud magic found in Apple’s AirPods Pro in a sportier, cheaper form. They sound good, have effective noise-cancelling and solid battery life. The spatial audio virtual surround sound system is really great with Apple gear and some of the smart features are available on Android, too. They are small and don’t have stalks. The wing design keeps them locked in place but can take some fiddling to get comfortable. The charging case is a bit larger than I would like but still pocketable. They are bettered on sound, noise-cancelling and battery life by the very best. And, unfortunately, the battery cannot be replaced, ultimately making them disposable and losing a star. But if you want a set of all-purpose earbuds for iPhone or Android that can silence the commute, do justice to movies on your phone and stay put when it’s time to pound the pavement, there aren’t many better than the Beats Fit Pro. Pros: great sound and noise-cancelling, decent battery and case, great connectivity, good controls, advanced features with Apple devices including spatial audio, some special features with Android, rock-solid fit for exercise or commute, decent call quality Cons: can be a fiddle to get comfortable, charging case larger than rivals, no wireless charging, only IPX4 sweat resistance, cannot be repaired, expensive.",News/Technology,Beats Fit Pro review: Apple’s workout-ready AirPods Pro rivals,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/31/beats-fit-pro-review-apple-workout-ready-airpods-pro-rivals-battery-price
1/31/2022,"After Barry Harris retired, he was “hanging around the house, slipping into the daytime telly routine”. His wife, a midwife, must have felt troubled by that, because she told him: “Just find something to do! Volunteer or something.” Harris had spent 40 years as a graphic designer, working his way up from a paste-up artist after graduating from art school till he retired as a freelance in the packaging sector. All that time he lived in Warrington, Cheshire, where the couple’s four children were born. It’s a long time in one place and one profession, and perhaps why, when pushed to act, he popped into a local job agency. “I just asked: ‘What have you got?’ And they said: ‘Can you drive?’”  He delivered bathrooms and then solar panels, before getting a job at the food retailer Greencore, delivering sandwiches and groceries, “travelling from A to B and meeting the customers”. He was 62. “It was refreshing because it was completely different.” There are about 40 routes out of the depot. “We go all the way up to Carlisle, across to Yorkshire, Anglesey and down to Stoke-on-Trent.” But Harris’s favourite is the 200-mile round trip to the Lake District. “It’s unbelievable, the scenery up there,” he says. “The freedom of it all.” Of course, there are deliveries to make, but the only responsibility is “going from A to B to C”, whereas family life with four children “was a rollercoaster”. Sometimes, when he sits behind the wheel of his van, radio on, countryside rolling past the window, he remembers his first ever long drive, in his first car. He was 20. He bought a Morris Minor on a Thursday and set off for Cornwall at two o’clock the next morning. “We just decided to go, a gang of us. I wasn’t married. No kids. No responsibilities.” It took about eight hours, switching drivers, the world opening up around them till they reached Newquay at 10pm that evening. “We didn’t have a care in the world,” he says. He gets similar feelings from this job. “It’s just widening your horizon. Getting up and going out.” Driving has turned the everyday “into an adventure”. There’s the banter in the office where Harris, promoted to team leader, is “20 or 30 years older than the majority” of his colleagues. “I give as good as I’m given,” he says. There’s always different music on: “My era was early 70s, and their interests are 80s, 90s and 00s. There is always something to talk about.” Switching to this very different occupation has made Harris feel ready to try new things. He started saxophone lessons a few years ago, and now gigs with a band; he is 20 years older than his bandmates too. It’s another first. “Maybe I should have done things earlier and not confined myself to one area, but it’s done now,” he says. At grammar school in East Ham, east London, where he grew up before moving to Warrington at 16, Harris was academic, and passed eight O-levels. East Ham was “a melting pot of different cultures. We were all in the same boat. Being Jamaican was part of that,” he says. His father had come to England from Jamaica in the late 1940s but “he never talked about Jamaica”. Or “Maybe he did talk about Jamaica, but being a youngster it washed over me.” As his father was dying in 2012, he started to talk about how “they kept farmyard animals in the garden, walking so many miles to school, things like that”. His father’s side of the family “all came to pay their respects” from Jamaica; it was the first time Harris had met them. Either way, he has never been to Jamaica. But maybe as part of his recent “opening up”, he will. He lets out a big sigh. “Could be like finding my roots.” Does he think he will get there? “Could be next year.” All that is needed is, he says, to say: “Let’s do it. Let’s go.” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",Lifestyle/Life and style,A new start after 60: ‘I went from graphic designer to delivery driver – now every day is an adventure!’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/31/a-new-start-after-60-i-went-from-graphic-designer-to-delivery-driver-now-every-day-is-an-adventure
1/31/2022,"A booming online industry specialising in fake passports with official visas and travel stamps is offering people with links to Islamic State the opportunity to leave Syria and travel onwards to the UK, EU, Canada and the US, a Guardian investigation has found. One such network, run by an Uzbek with extremist links living in Turkey, is now selling high-quality fake passports for up to $15,000 (£11,132) purporting to be from various countries. In at least 10 cases the Guardian is aware of, people who illegally crossed the Syrian border into Turkey have used his products to depart through Istanbul airport.  Sellers claim the EU is the most popular destination but say in at least two cases people were able to travel from Istanbul to Mexico on fake Russian passports and, from there, illegally over the border into the US. Niger and Mauritania are also popular destinations, as are Ukraine and Afghanistan. The Uzbek’s business is doing so well he recently opened a new channel on the encrypted messaging app Telegram with the official-sounding name “Istanbul Global Consulting”. The growing trade suggests that dangerous extremists could be slipping under the radar of security services around the world, escaping justice for past crimes and potentially able to continue terrorist activity in countries other than Syria. “I do not ask about which group someone is with. I am willing to work with anyone,” the Uzbek said in a message chat with the Guardian, which posed as an interested client. “It is not my job to see who is bad and who is not. The security services should deal with it.” Western security officials warned in 2015 that IS had managed to obtain significant equipment such as blank passport books and printers to make Syrian and Iraqi passports, which it used to disguise operatives among the more than 1 million people who fled to Europe during the peak of the refugee crisis. IS claimed several attacks around the continent shortly after, including the November 2015 attack on the Bataclan theatre in Paris and the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017. Since then, European border agencies have invested in technology and personnel training to better identify forged passports. In 2020, Tajikistan totally overhauled its consular staff in Istanbul and document system in an attempt to stamp out the use of fake Tajik passports. But in response, sellers of fake passports have also upped their game, using a wider variety of nationalities for prospective clients. The Uzbek sent several videos of his wares, including crisp new French, Belgian, Bulgarian and Russian passports that appear to feature authentic security watermarks and holograms. When placed under a black light, two Russian passports contain UV-sensitive materials designed to stop passport forgery, and a Belgian passport placed on a scanner similar to those used in airports appears to read correctly, with the holder’s details appearing on the monitor. According to document sellers, it is impossible to fake a working biometric chip, but at many border crossings officials checking passports simply ignore those that don’t work, waving the passport holder through. “There is a particular seller in Turkey who provides IS members with very high level [ie, well forged] documents,” using interlocutors who speak Russian, Arabic and other languages to cater for different clients, said a source at the US Department of Homeland Security. “We are aware of IS members using these fake passports to cross to Europe, and European security is not successful in arresting them all.” While the document sellers’ most popular service is providing documents for foreign fighters in Syria associated with IS and other armed groups to travel to Europe, the group has also identified new areas to expand. On a Telegram chat for people in al-Hawl, a camp in north-east Syria home to about 60,000 women and children with links to IS, one of the Uzbek’s online marketers, a foreign woman detained in another camp nearby, has posted: “If you need fake documents from Russia, Central Asia, Turkey, Europe, DM me.” The fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban had also created a new client base of Afghan refugees in Turkey, the Uzbek said. Although his services are too expensive for most displaced Afghans, he says his clients use the fake passports to board flights to western countries, and then claim asylum once they land. While low-ranked IS fighters usually barely have money to buy one passport, high-level members who want to completely drop off the grid usually buy several documents from different countries, and use them to move around frequently, changing passport for every new flight or transfer, said a Russian passport seller. A Russian national who fought for IS until 2015 said: “I had only a couple of hundred dollars when I came from Syria so I bought the cheapest passport – a really poor-quality Tajik passport. It did not work and I was arrested in the airport in Istanbul. “Then my family back home collected enough money to buy a better-quality one. So I got a real Russian passport, but with my photo on it, and was able to get to Ukraine with it. It is a really good one – I was once stopped by police in Ukraine and they took it but returned it to me a week later saying everything is good. Unfortunately this passport is expiring now so I am currently trying to get money to buy a new one.” To make sure a person disappears completely, for $500 the Uzbek seller can even offer a Turkish death certificate that can be sent to their home country’s consulate. “Unless you are Abu Bakr Baghdadi [The IS leader, killed in 2019] no one would go to the morgue to check if you really died. They would just accept that document and enter it into the system,” he said. There are several passport options, depending on the clients’ ethnicity, languages they speak, where they want to go, and how much they have to spend. The cheapest documents with which to get to Europe are Russian, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan passports, which cost about $5,000, or $6,000 as part of a Schengen visa package. Other popular and slightly more expensive options are Ukrainian and Moldovan papers, which allow visa-free travel to the EU. The most expensive option is an EU passport, which will set a client back $8,000, usually requested by westerners and Arabs who speak some French and can pass for French or Belgian. Typically, an EU citizen arrives in Turkey on his or her own passport, sells it to the Uzbek and his colleagues for about €2,500, then the passport photo is changed to that of a client. The original owner of the passport then claims it has been lost and applies for a replacement at his or her consulate in Istanbul. The passports are printed in their countries of origin and taken to the country where the client is waiting, where they receive official border entry stamps, which helps cement the legitimacy of the document. “The passport itself relatively doesn’t cost anything. What does cost is the stamps,” said the Russian seller. “The majority of the money goes into bribes for stamps.” “In the past the quality of passports on the market was bad so there was a limited number of countries one could travel to from Syria,” he said. “Now those passports are of such good quality that if you have enough money, you could go absolutely anywhere.”",News/World news,Revealed: how fake passports allow IS members to enter Europe and US,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/revealed-how-fake-passports-allow-is-members-to-enter-europe-and-us

Nearby, Byron’s epitaph for his beloved dog Boatswain is carved under an urn.Gardens open daily, £6 per car or £2 for walkers and cyclists, newsteadabbey.org.uk From Welshpool’s bunting-strung High Street, you can walk up through the steep landscaped park, with herds of antlered deer, to arrive at the red, gritstone walls of Powis Castle. First built on a high, rocky outcrop in the 13th century, the castle now has celebrated terraced gardens with views that stretch as far as the Shropshire hills. Urn-topped balustrades and dancing shepherdesses line the walkways; an Ozymandian stone foot stands in the wooded wilderness with views through bare trees back up to the castle terraces, patrolled by jewel-bright peacocks. In the Edwardian formal garden, there are century-old lichen-covered apple trees between box-hedge arches and topiaried yew.Garden and cafe are open daily until 18 February, £10/£5 for adults/children, nationaltrust.org.uk A leafy regional offshoot of Edinburgh’s Royal Botanic Garden, Dawyck was the UK’s first carbon-neutral botanic garden, with the fast-flowing burn powering hydroelectricity. February snowdrops form a ghostly mist over the gently-sloping banks. Dawyck’s geographically-themed areas, among wooded hills, showcase a global collection of plants: there are Chinese dawn redwoods, Serbian spruce trees, Korean arborvitae and Chilean plum yews. There’s also a trail of rare Scottish plants, including the woolly willow that was threatened by overgrazing. The cafe does seasonal soups and scones plus sweets like triple-chocolate orange brownies. International fungi researchers are drawn to Dawyck’s wild, ferny Cryptogamic Sanctuary, an area of semi-native woodland sporting hundreds of species of mushroom among mosses, lichens and liverworts.Open daily from 1 February, £7.20 adults/free for under 16s, rbge.org.uk This English Heritage flagship stately in rural north Essex has interiors by neoclassical architect Robert Adam (several of which feature as locations in The Crown) and big, picnic-ready grounds by Capability Brown.

1/31/2022,"Q I need advice on extending the lease on my flat. I have owned the flat for sometime and am ashamed to say I have done nothing about the lease as I didn’t realise it was a problem until I started looking for a new mortgage. I share the freehold with the lady who owns the flat upstairs. Does this make it any easier? I have no idea how to go about this and all I hear is how it is going to be incredibly expensive. Please help.RS  A All you hear about the lease extension process being incredibly expensive is not necessarily true. If all the other freeholder owners – or, in your case, the other co-freeholder – agree to your proposed lease extension, according to Niki Adkins, an associate and leasehold specialist at Frettons solicitors, the only expenses involved are legal costs and Land Registry fees. “As you would effectively be granting a lease extension to yourself as freeholder,” Adkins says, “there would usually be no premium (price) payable for the extension.” So yes, if you can get the agreement of the lady upstairs to extend your lease, it does make it easier and simpler. If she won’t agree, you can still extend your lease but the process is more complicated and you could end up having to pay a premium for the extension in the same way as you would if your were just a leaseholder (so not a part-freeholder as well) wanting to extend a lease. For more information on doing that and when you are able to, go to the Leasehold Advisory Service. As well as getting the agreement of the lady upstairs, you should also get your lender’s agreement but this is very unlikely to be a problem as a lease extension will improve the value of the property, which is the bank or building society’s security. If everybody is happy, what usually happens, Adkins says, is everyone agrees to “a freeholder’s lease to be extended to 999 years with the ground rent – if any – officially being reduced to a peppercorn rate”, ie nil.

1/31/2022,"The New Zealand government has defended its strict quarantine system known as MIQ after a pregnant New Zealand journalist said she had to turn to the Taliban for help after her requests to get back to her own country were rejected. Charlotte Bellis discovered she was pregnant a short time after gaining international attention in 2021 for questioning Taliban leaders about their treatment of women and girls. She is due to give birth in May.  She resigned from Al Jazeera in November and had no choice but to leave Qatar, where sex outside marriage is illegal. She and her partner, Jim Huylebroek, moved to his native Belgium. But she could not stay long, she wrote in a column published in the New Zealand Herald on Saturday, because she was not a resident. She said the only other place the couple had visas to live was Afghanistan. She said she had sent 59 documents to New Zealand authorities in Afghanistan but they rejected her application for an emergency return. New Zealand’s Covid-19 response minister, Chris Hipkins, said on Monday there were places in MIQ for people with special circumstances. “No one’s saying there is not,” he said. “I understand she wanted to return on a specific date and that officials reached out to her for more information shortly after looking at her application. The emergency allocation criteria includes a requirement to travel to New Zealand within the next 14 days. Ms Bellis indicated she did not intend to travel until the end of February and has been encouraged by MIQ to consider moving her plans forward. “I understand officials have also since invited her to apply for another emergency category. I encourage her to take these offers seriously. “I also understand she was offered New Zealand consular assistance twice since she returned to Afghanistan in early December.” The emergency allocation criteria included pregnancy, he said. “This includes for medical treatment if a mother is overseas and cannot get the required treatment where they are, and allowing people to urgently return to New Zealand to provide critical care for a dependent, such as their spouse or partner who is pregnant.” Speaking to RNZ on Monday morning, Bellis said she signed up for an MIQ spot via the medical treatment pathway because it was how pregnant women were told to apply. She was then asked to reapply under a category designed for New Zealanders in a location or a situation where there was a serious risk to their safety, she said. “What does that say to women, does that mean there is no pathway for pregnant women? We signed up to the right one, the medical treatment is the correct one.” She told RNZ the authorities had all the information but their application was met with “clauses and technicalities and confusion”. “First it was ‘we denied you because it’s more than 14 days’. Then it was ‘you don’t meet a threshold for medical stuff’, now it’s something else. Why so many excuses and clauses? You have all the information.” New Zealand has managed to keep the spread of the virus to a minimum during the pandemic and has reported just 52 Covid deaths among its population of 5 million. But the requirement that even returning citizens spend 10 days isolating in quarantine hotels run by the military has led to a backlog of thousands of people vying for spots. Hipkins said the border framework had served New Zealand “exceptionally well” at keeping those within the country safe and preventing health services from becoming swamped. The government has signalled there will be changes at the border soon.",News/World news,New Zealand defends strict Covid quarantine after pregnant journalist ‘had to turn to Taliban’ for help,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/charlotte-bellis-new-zealand-defends-miq-strict-quarantine-pregnant-journalist-help-taliban
1/31/2022,"Hello, Warren Murray here bearing tidings of Monday.  The Bank of England is poised to raise interest rates this Thursday amid growing concern over high inflation and Britain’s cost of living crisis. Economists expect an increase from 0.25% to 0.5%. Official inflation reached 5.4% in December, the highest level since March 1992. The Bank has warned it could peak at close to 6% by April, three times the 2% target rate set by the government. Steffan Ball from Goldman Sachs said the Bank’s monetary policy committee might increase interest rates to as high as 1.25% by November this year. “We now expect the Bank of England to hike in back-to-back meetings through May.” An increase in borrowing costs is likely to complicate businesses’ recovery from Covid. Economic activity has increased in recent weeks as consumers gradually return to socialising and working in town and city centres, and plan B restrictions in England were dropped. There are concerns that young people who lost their jobs during the pandemic in the UK have returned to less secure work, often in gig economy roles. Johnson barrels along – Westminster begins the week awaiting the Sue Gray report on No 10 parties, alongside which police inquiries continue. A beleaguered Boris Johnson will try to regain control of the agenda – today he is due to announce plans for a “Brexit freedoms” bill to make it easier to rip up EU regulations and protections. The prime minister is expected to visit Ukraine with the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, early this week, and the levelling-up white paper is scheduled for publication on Wednesday. Whitehall sources said they also expected developments this week on help for families struggling with the cost of energy bills. Dominic Cummings told NYMag on Sunday that it was his “duty to get rid” of Johnson as prime minister, describing it as “sort of like fixing the drains”. Doctor was fatal poisoner, court finds – An NHS doctor killed his partner’s father and almost caused the deaths of her and her mother by giving them coffee containing the heavy metal poison thallium, the family court has ruled. Mr Justice Williams made the finding in a case between the doctor and his now ex-partner over care arrangements for their child. The case is highly unusual legally because the medic has been found to have committed the killing in a civil court, on the balance of probabilities of the evidence, rather than in a criminal court, in which a jury has to be sure beyond all reasonable doubt. The judge ordered the parties’ identities be kept anonymous but said the poisoner was a Bulgarian-born doctor who moved to the UK in the late 2000s. The doctor is not currently working and has not been criminally charged. A statement issued by Delphine Philip Law, his solicitors, said he “vehemently denies” the poisonings and “he stated that the court took inadequate account of the fact that there was no direct evidence to collaborate [his former partner’s] allegations”. Vaccine waiver for NHS staff? – Hospitals in England could continue to employ unvaccinated NHS healthcare workers beyond the April deadline if not doing so risks leaving them dangerously understaffed, the sector regulator, the CQC, has indicated. Sajid Javid is planning to drop the requirement that health and care staff must be vaccinated, the Telegraph has reported. Spotify has said it will direct listeners to accurate Covid-19 information as uproar over the misinformation shared on Joe Rogan’s podcast continued to grow, with the streamer losing billions in market value and more musicians withdrawing their music. ‘Rape trials will only get longer’ – The typical delay between a rape offence and the end of the resulting criminal case rose to 1,000 days in 2021 for the first time, figures show. The data also shows 576 rape cases waiting more than a year to come to court by the end of September 2021, well over double the average of the previous five years. Labour says the situation is getting worse every year. Jo Sidhu QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said: “Rape trials are only going to get longer unless government puts the resources in place to ensure we have enough prosecutors and defenders to tackle the backlogs.” A spokesperson said the government was “overhauling our entire response to rape”, including boosting funding for support services to £185m, recruiting more police, introducing new justice scorecards and increasing court capacity “so victims get the justice they deserve quicker”. Southgate invests in Thank You Day – Gareth Southgate is hoping to help lead what could be the UK’s biggest ever appreciation party during the Queen’s jubilee celebrations. The England manager – alongside celebrities including Ross Kemp, Gary Lineker and Levi Roots – is aiming to encourage millions of people to take part in neighbourhood parties in June celebrating community spirit and the Queen on what they have dubbed National Thank You Day. Ten million partygoers marked the Queen’s first 25 years on the throne in 1977 and similar numbers celebrated the marriage of Charles and Diana in 1981. Celebrity backers, also including Prue Leith, Alan Titchmarsh and Lorraine Kelly, will be raising the event’s profile in the run-up to Sunday 5 June, the final day of the Queen’s official jubilee celebrations. As the Grenfell inquiry heads towards its concluding stages, politicians will be called to account for their part in the deadly fire.

While the UK government has remained silent, European governments have moved to protect households from the full brunt of the global energy crisis.
