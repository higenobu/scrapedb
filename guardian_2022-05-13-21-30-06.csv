5/13/2022,"Ukrainian forces have repelled a Russian attempt to cross a strategically significant river west of Severodonetsk in the Donbas, incurring heavy losses in the process according to British defence intelligence. The British said that Russia had lost “significant armoured manoeuvre elements” from a battalion tactical group – a formation with about 800 personnel at full strength – as well as the pontoon bridging equipment. Severodonetsk is the easternmost town held by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, and the effort to cross the Siversky Donets river to its west was likely to have been intended to be a fresh attempt by the Russians to cut off the defending forces. Ukraine’s defence ministry tweeted out pictures of a smashed pontoon bridge and destroyed armoured vehicles on Wednesday, describing them of victims of “artillerymen of the 17th tank brigade”. The British assessment appears to verify that, and quantify the level of loss – effectively the equipment strength of one battalion of about 100 such Russian units operating in and near Ukraine. “Conducting river crossings in a contested environment is a highly risky manoeuvre and speaks to the pressure the Russian commanders are under to make progress in their operations in eastern Ukraine,” the British MoD said on Friday morning. Russian forces have made incremental progress on the north side of the river, and are assessed to be in control of Rubizhne to the north-west of Severodonetsk on Thursday by the Institute for the Study of War. “They will likely launch a ground offensive on or around Severodonetsk in the coming days,” the Institute said, but added that it was “unclear if Russian forces can encircle, let alone capture” Severodonetsk as the impetus in the Russian effort in the Donbas region appeared generally to have faded. Elsewhere on the ground on Friday, Ukraine claimed it had damaged a Russian navy logistics ship near Snake Island in the Black Sea. “Thanks to the actions of our naval seamen, the support vessel Vsevolod Bobrov caught fire – it is one of the newest in the Russian fleet,” said Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesperson for the Odesa regional military administration. Satellite imagery provided by Maxar, a private US-based company, showed the aftermath of what it said were probable missile attacks on a Russian Serna-class landing craft near the island, close to Ukraine’s sea border with Romania. Maxar images also showed recent damage to buildings on the island. Russia’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Renewed fighting around Snake Island in recent days may become a battle for control of the western Black Sea coast, according to defence officials, as Russian forces struggle to make headway in Ukraine’s north and east. Ukrainian forces are reported to have driven Russian troops out of the region around the second-largest city, Kharkiv. Reuters news agency said its journalists had confirmed Ukraine was in control of territory stretching to the banks of the Siverskiy Donets River, about 25 miles (40km) east of Kharkiv. Fighting has continued in Ukraine’s south and east. Ukraine’s presidency said shelling continued throughout Luhansk – part of the Donbas region where Ukrainian forces are fighting Russian armour and Kremlin-backed separatists. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his Thursday night address to the nation that Russian forces had destroyed 570 healthcare facilities in the country, including 101 hospitals. “What for? It’s nonsense. It’s barbarity.” In the north-eastern region of Chernihiv, three people were killed and 12 others wounded on Thursday in a strike on a school in Novhorod-Siversky, the emergency services said. Iryna Vereshchuk, a Ukrainian deputy prime minister, said “difficult talks” were under way over the evacuation of 38 seriously wounded troops from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. She said: “We have started a new round of negotiations around a roadmap for an [evacuation] operation. And we will start with those who are badly wounded,” she told Ukraine’s 1+1 television.",News/World news,"Ukraine has repelled Russia’s attempt to cross Donbas river, UK confirms",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/13/ukraine-has-repelled-russias-attempt-to-cross-donbas-river-uk-confirms
5/13/2022,"The 16-strong executive of Wakefield constituency Labour party (CLP) has resigned en masse, accusing Keir Starmer of stitching up the selection of a candidate for the forthcoming byelection. Party members in Wakefield claim the leader’s office has failed to abide by Labour rules, by allowing the local party only one seat of five on the panels for longlisting and then shortlisting candidates. They argue that neither of the two people who made it through to the shortlist, Kate Dearden and Simon Lightwood, have local roots, and several other plausible candidates, including the deputy leader of Wakefield council, Jack Hemingway, were passed over. “These were strong candidates, with a proven track record and local connections,” said one party member who did not wish to be named. One Labour shadow cabinet member described the behaviour of Starmer’s office in handling the selection as “arrogant”. “We don’t want to legitimise what’s happened,” said one of those who has resigned. Some Labour sources suggested Starmer’s office had been keen to keep Hemingway, an avowed leftwinger, off the list. Hemingway had sparred on Twitter with the chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, Mike Katz, with Katz accusing him of appearing to play down antisemitism, and showing support for former Labour MP George Galloway. Hemingway replied that he “had never hidden the fact he was on the left of the party,” and comments he had made about antisemitism not being institutional in Labour came before the outcome of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report on the Labour party. “I along with my local Labour group voted unanimously for the adoption of the IHRA [International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance] definition of AS to be accepted. I am an anti-racist and firmly believe antisemitism is a scourge that must be defeated.” The CLP executive – elected by local members – has decided to resign, rather than play any further part in the selection process. A formal statement is expected to be issued later on Friday. The final selection decision will be made on Sunday. A Labour spokesperson said: “The selection process was run in accordance with the guidance issued by the NEC in October 2021. The same panel composition has been used for Old Bexley and Sidcup, North Shropshire, and Erdington.” Candidates for byelections are often chosen using a truncated selection process. Some members expressed concern that Dearden and Lightwood had previously been remainers, like the former Labour MP for the constituency, Mary Creagh, who lost her seat at the 2019 general election. Wakefield voted 63% to leave the EU. Dearden is a former chair of Labour Students, who is now head of research, policy and external affairs at the Community trade union, while Lightwood formerly worked for Creagh. Their supporters point out that both live either in or near the constituency. The closely watched byelection was triggered by the resignation of Imran Ahmad Khan, the former Conservative MP who was convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. Labour will be keen to win to show that after promising results in last week’s local elections the party can regain parts of the former “red wall” that forms a key part of Boris Johnson’s governing majority. Starmer’s predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, also faced accusations of stitching up local selections in order to place favoured candidates in winnable seats.",News/Politics,Wakefield Labour executive resigns accusing Starmer of byelection stitch-up,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/13/wakefield-labour-executive-resigns-accusing-keir-starmer-byelection-stich-up
5/13/2022,"My mum is watching TV in the kitchen, my dad is at work. The house is quiet. I assess: the TV is booming from the kitchen. My mum will be in there for a while. I switch channels. There is a naked woman on screen, covered in clay, pressing herself against a wall. I am not meant to be watching this. I look nervously at the kitchen door and turn the volume down. Her lips move but the words are inaudible. Now more people are getting naked and rubbing clay on breasts, thighs, genitalia. They jump up and down and cheer. They squish themselves against the wall like flies on a windscreen. I scoot closer to the TV. My chest rises and falls with the shallow gasps of someone so transfixed that they forget to breathe. I am 11 years old, watching a Big Brother pottery task get out of hand in the year 2000. My two decade-long love affair with reality TV is about to begin. Reality TV has been a constant companion throughout my life. As a pre-teen and then a teen, I watched all the hits: Big Brother, Popstars, Pop Idol, The X Factor, The Simple Life, but also lesser-known dross: Newlyweds, I’d Do Anything, Wife Swap. The Pop Idol final between Gareth Gates and Will Young was as seismic an event in my school playground as 9/11 or Diana’s death. In adulthood, reality TV fuelled bad decisions. Aged 21, I dyed my hair the same cherry-red as Cheryl Cole’s when she was an X Factor judge. I ended up in the hairdresser the next day sobbing, having it stripped out. My 20s were lost to Keeping Up With the Kardashians, as I watched Kim ascend to the apex of reality TV fame in snakeskin booties and a Michael Kors handbag. I bought false eyelashes to look like these glamorous sisters with raven-black hair. Now, in my 30s, I glug The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills like a lab rat hooked on sugar water. Watching the housewives shriek at each other in a Hollywood Hills mansion has a wonderfully calming quality. I like to lie in the bath after a long day and watch them fight. So when I began researching my forthcoming BBC Radio 4 podcast Unreal, co-written and co-presented with the journalist Pandora Sykes, I thought I knew how the story would shake out. I envisaged a lighthearted recap of my favourite shows, accompanied by deep dives into unresolved questions that linger to this day. (Like: did The Hills’ Lauren Conrad really have a sex tape, or did her frenemy Heidi Montag leak the rumour to generate a storyline? Or: whatever became of the contestants carved up by surgeons on grisly makeover show The Swan? And is the Kardashian Kurse to blame for the misfortune that befalls every adult with an XY chromosome who enters their orbit?) But what emerged was a dramatically different story. Reality TV has never enjoyed the same critical celebration as other formats, despite its commercial success and innovative production values. When The Only Way is Essex beat Sherlock and Downton Abbey to win a Bafta in 2011, cameras panned to Sherlock actor Martin Freeman’s expression of quiet consternation. Reviewing Keeping Up With the Kardashians when it launched in 2007, the New York Times announced that it was about “desperate women climbing to the margins of fame.” Fifteen years on, Kim Kardashian is a billionaire, prison reform activist, and former Keeping Up executive producer Farnaz Farjam told me when we spoke that she wouldn’t rule out a Kardashian run for elected office. If fellow reality star Donald Trump can do it, why not Kim? Her 299m Instagram followers would surely help. I suspect that this sneering condescension towards reality TV is partly class-based, partly gendered. Reality TV is a demotic form of entertainment – no opera lorgnettes here! – and it has offered a route into the entertainment industry for many people from working-class backgrounds. Jade Goody was the first, of course, but also Rylan Clark, Alison Hammond, Gemma Collins. And it’s a historically female-dominated genre, with many of the most successful shows of the past two decades led by female executives (such as Farjam, and Sarah Dillistone who worked on Towie and Made in Chelsea), or predominantly populated by women (like the world-conquering Real Housewives franchise, with 32 spin-offs and counting). I couldn’t begin to tell you the amount of times I’ve had to justify my ardour for reality TV to men who think nothing of watching people ride bicycles very fast in circles all day long. How do I love reality TV? Let me count the ways. I love the humour: Amy Childs vajazzling Sam Faiers with a Carry On wink. Curtis Pritchard claiming that he really, really wants to make his fellow Love Islanders coffee in the morning to get out of cuddling the girl he’s coupled up with. The Celebrity Big Brother housemates getting confused and thinking that David Gest is dead, wrenching back the covers only to see the bemused TV producer sleeping soundly. I love the way the Real Housewives gives space to women in their 50s and 60s – who are so typically run off our screens – and allows them to discuss common female anxieties about ageing and infidelity. I love the intrigue, and the drama, of course – who doesn’t? – but also the way reality TV can communicate serious messages to the general public. After Jade Goody was diagnosed with cervical cancer in August 2008, while appearing on Big Brother India, an extra 400,000 women attended their screening appointments. But in recent years, I’ve begun to feel conflicted about my passion for the genre. In 2020, information started leaking out about the effects of fame on The X Factor contestants. Former contestant Misha B said she felt suicidal after appearing on the show, specifically after judge Tulisa suggested she was a bully. Rebecca Ferguson, who came second in 2010, said that, after leaving the programme, she was forced to keep working on her music career while suffering a miscarriage. “For those who say you knew what you were getting into! I almost died promoting music for you all to listen to! Nope definitely did not! ever! In a million years sign up for that!,” Ferguson posted to Twitter. The irrepressibly bouffant-haired twins Jedward got in on the act, saying that their “biggest regret in life was not telling the judges on X Factor to f*ck off”, and that every contestant was a “slave” to the show who got paid “zero” while producers made millions. Suddenly, all those Saturday evenings I stayed in, humming along to a pre-fame Little Mix, hit differently. Also in 2020, Love Island presenter Caroline Flack died. Hers was the fourth suicide associated with the show: two ex-contestants, and one ex-contestant’s boyfriend, had also killed themselves in recent years. Watching last year’s cohort of young, genetically blessed islanders tan by the pool, I felt complicit in something murky. My suspicions about the damaging effects of post-Love Island influencer fame were confirmed when I interviewed 2021 contestant Jake Cornish for the podcast. Trolls had threatened to murder him in front of his infant niece. Cornish was all masculine bluster – he was unaffected, he insisted – but not everyone has such a thick skin, nor should they. What happens to the contestants who can’t cope with this sudden, acrid fame? There are no two ways about it: creating an entertaining reality TV show, and an ethical one, can be irreconcilable objectives. Historically, audiences have wanted conflict, even if it sometimes comes at the expense of contestants’ wellbeing and personal safety. (Who can forget the now-notorious “Fight Night” in Big Brother 5, which ended in security teams having to separate the warring housemates?) The Grecian pillars propping up the ornate marble roof of the reality TV Parthenon are conflict, producer meddling and editing. Frankenstein editing techniques make it possible to stitch together conversations that were never said. Off-camera producers manipulate contestants like twirling marionettes. (It’s worth remembering that Fight Night only took place because Big Brother producers showed housemates footage of other housemates talking about them, and plied them with alcohol. Still, the episode pulled in great ratings: so in producer terms, it was a win.) But there are positive indicators that these pillars of exploitation are being chipped away by modern, socially conscious audiences. Last year’s Love Island saw a record number of complaints to Ofcom, who felt that Faye Winter’s expletive-filled outburst against fellow housemate Teddy Soares was, rightly, unacceptable. Aftercare has been strengthened on all major reality shows, although I’d question whether there’s a limit to what even the most stringent welfare package can achieve against the fetid roar of social media. And there’s an indication that audiences may be losing their taste for conflict, as a new crop of kinder reality TV shows surge in the ratings, like the delightfully bonkers The Masked Singer. All of my criticisms, I utter with love. I have no more desire to see reality TV crumble than I have to stop the spring rains, or flowers growing. How could I disrespect the great house that has brought me such pleasure? But a few structural changes wouldn’t go amiss. Ethical producers; more rigid pre-filming checks; less salacious exploitation. I hope selfishly that these changes are made, and that in years to come you’ll find me curled up in the reality TV Parthenon still, watching the Housewives bickering under its great marble roof.

5/13/2022,"Tonight we’re listening to Dom Juan’s seductive escapades in English. Tomorrow night this bilingual production, from co-creators Theatre Lab and Exchange Theatre, will be performed in French. The setting is Venice and the translation is by the American academic Brett Bodemer. Performed to mark Molière’s 4ooth anniversary, this eclectic production from director Anastasia Revi certainly celebrates the breadth of the French writer’s influence – but a lot of his original wit and clarity have been lost in translation. Disappointingly, it’s the language that suffers most. Lead actors Dimitri Jeannest and David Furlong, playing Dom Juan and his servant Sganarelle, rattle through their dialogue at quite a clip. The frantic pacing infuses the show with a chaotic sense of comedy but there’s little weighting or shape to the scenes and they race by in a blur. Revi’s decision to create a gender-fluid production doesn’t quite come off either. A number of Dom Juan’s female love interests are played by male actors and reinterpreted as broad comedy cameos. Nathan Ricard gives a good panto dame but it seems odd to use the casting to give yet more stage time to men (never knowingly under-served in Molière’s play) and diminish the female roles rather than enhance them. Tellingly, the best moments are without language. Costume designer Valentina Sanna has created (or at least sourced) a striking array of masks, which inject the dance, movement and fight sequences with a lingering sense of eeriness. In particular, a comic mime performed in that most romantic of settings, a Venetian gondola, finds an interesting way to laugh at the absurdity of love.

5/13/2022,"In the years since I wrote my first book, deaf creatives have undeniably gained mainstream visibility, particularly in film and television. Thanks to the tireless work of deaf and disabled advocates, the majority of deaf characters on screen are now being played by deaf actors. From the Oscar-winning ensemble of Coda and superheroes in Marvel’s Eternals to the recent Spider-Man video game and reality stars such as Nyle DiMarco and Rose Ayling-Ellis, deaf performers have repeatedly smashed through longstanding barriers. Deaf screenwriters Josh Feldman and Shoshannah Stern even showcased dual talents by starring in and writing the Sundance television series This Close. In literature, too, we have seen prominent works by deaf writers. In poetry, the brilliant Ilya Kaminsky’s Deaf Republic was published to widespread critical acclaim, and Raymond Antrobus became the first poet ever to win the Rathbones Folio prize. Last month there were two deaf authors – DiMarco and me – on the New York Times bestellers list. But it hasn’t always been this way. I wrote my first novel, published in 2015, while I was a student on a graduate writing course. Each day, my classmates and I gathered on the fourth floor of Columbia University’s Dodge Hall to be taught the craft of writing and discern what constituted a book or story’s “worth”. I was the only deaf person there. I spent most of my time trying to mimic the voices of the authors we read rather than trying to find my own. I suspect this is true of lots of young writers, but for me there was an added layer of separation from self – my Deaf identity (generally we use the big D to denote Deafness as a culture/community, versus the lowercase-d deafness as the audiologic state) was increasingly important to me, but there were no deaf writers or characters in the books I’d read. Slowly, I’d come to assume they just didn’t exist. It was ableism, first systemic, then internalised, that made me think this way. The isolation I was experiencing might sound naive to Deaf people who grew up with the privilege of a robust Deaf education or a nearby creative community. For me, though I always loved learning, it had long been synonymous with a certain degree of solitude. Having been taught exclusively hearing works in hearing classrooms, I believed writing belonged to the hearing world, and I was unsure if I would be able to break through. Then, about halfway through my graduate studies, a professor assigned us The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers. I still remember the flutter of excitement in my stomach the moment I realised those characters were deaf. The thrill was shortlived. Quickly I learned that literary fiction was an inhospitable place for deaf people. The character of John Singer was less human being than he was receptacle for the thoughts and feelings of hearing characters, and by the end of the novel both he and his only friend, Spiros, also deaf, were driven insane and died. As abrasive an introduction to deaf characters as it was, it would also come to ping something latent in me. I continued in the programme, read many beautiful books, ingested lectures from intelligent professors, and made a handful of hearing friends who ventured to learn American Sign Language (ASL) in order to share the work of conversation. Often it was a positive environment and I learned a lot. I finished writing my first novel there. That book, Girl at War, was personal and important to me, but after it was done, I remained haunted by the ghost of John Singer. I didn’t want to be a vessel for hearing stories, and I didn’t want to be alone any more. I had Deaf friends, but they were not writers. Fortunately, the revelation that I needed to commune with Deaf writers happened at exactly the right time. It was around 2015, and social media was burgeoning; Twitter in particular allowed me to connect with the Deaf writing community. In virtual spaces, we could parse out what it meant to be a Deaf person working in English, discuss the importance of intersectional representation of deaf people in literature. Mostly, though, being with other Deaf writers gave me exactly what hearing writers get from being in community with one another: the courage to sit down and tackle the book I really wanted to write. True Biz, my new book, is a thoroughly Deaf novel, in character, plot and form. Lately, as I travel and speak with readers about True Biz, I’ve finally been able to verbalise what has always been true, even when I was unwittingly fighting against it: I would not have become a writer without ASL. For some, this seems counterintuitive, since I write in English. But language bears more than the work of communicating with the mainstream world; it is also the internal vehicle for our thoughts and feelings, the mechanism through which we understand ourselves. Without first having had ASL, I would not have understood myself as a person with a story to tell. Deafness isn’t a monolith, of course, and writers and creators have only just scratched the surface of the deaf experience. There is still much work to be done to amplify the diverse voices within our community. Deaf and disability inclusion isn’t a box to be ticked off an equity checklist – it’s a state of constant progress. It’s my hope that the current increase in representation will not be viewed as a fad or a “moment” for deaf people, but the new normal. While the level of deaf visibility may feel new to most, as it did once to me, we need to understand that scores of talented deaf writers and creatives have always been there, and have always deserved to be heard. What’s changing now is the hearing world’s willingness to listen. True Biz by Sara Nović is published by Little, Brown at £18.99.

5/13/2022,"The Royal Opera’s Jette Parker Young Artists have opted for modernism for their first post-lockdown production, with a double bill of Stravinsky’s Mavra and Schoenberg’s Pierrot Lunaire, conducted by Michael Papadopoulos and directed by Anthony Almeida. It’s an unusual pairing. Stravinsky’s 1922 comedy, about a soldier cross-dressing in order to gain employment as a maid to his girlfriend’s mother, remains something of a rarity. Nowadays, meanwhile, we would usually expect to encounter Schoenberg’s moonstruck Pierrot in the concert hall rather than the theatre, though we should not forget that the work was originally a cabaret piece and later became a ballet, choreographed by Glen Tetley. What links them, as Almeida’s staging makes clear, are ideas about gender and identity. Drag permits Vasily access to a world his masculinity denies him. Tradition, meanwhile, assigns the role of Pierrot to a woman, even though Schoenberg’s protagonist is male and the gender of the performer is undesignated in the score. Consequently what we first see, during the overture to Mavra, is Alexandra Lowe’s Pierrot discarding women’s clothes to become a Dietrich-like androgyne, while Egor Zhuravskii’s Vasily experiments with trying on Mavra’s wig. The problem is that Pierrot’s presence as a silent extra figure in the first few minutes of Mavra becomes seriously confusing. A set of gaudily papered walls, with an enormous light hanging from the ceiling, meanwhile, also serves both works. Almeida’s approach to Mavra is vaguely absurdist, as bin bags pile up like Ionesco’s chairs in the absence of a maid, and Parasha (April Koyejo-Audiger) looks on in disbelief as her preposterous, perfectionist Mother (Sarah Pring) makes and discards endless blancmanges. It’s all a bit laboured, however, until Zhuravskii – looking terrific in his maid’s outfit – arrives to enliven the proceedings. In the Schoenberg, meanwhile, where Almeida is much more assured, the ceiling light becomes the moon and the walls slowly disappear as Pierrot yields to fantasy and hallucination. The characters from Mavra become shadowy figures in the surrounding darkness, and the flautist from the instrumental ensemble materialises on stage and hovers round Lowe like a mysterious lover. Lowe gives a sensational, career-making performance here, pushing herself to her vocal limits in order to realise the expressive extremes of Schoenberg’s Sprechstimme. Zhuravskii, a singer to watch on this showing, dominates Mavra with his supple, elegant tenor. Koyejo-Audiger sounds good as Parasha, her warm tone contrasting with Idunnu Münch’s brighter voice as the busybody Neighbour. Papadopoulos’s conducting in Mavra is crisp if occasionally heavy-footed, and he seems more comfortable in Schoenberg, where the Britten Sinfonia play wonderfully well for him. As a whole, not all of it works, though Pierrot Lunaire is often outstanding.

5/13/2022,"London will be “rewilded” with new nature reserves, pocket parks and a mass community movement to bring nature back to the capital, the Guardian can reveal. A group of rewilding experts commissioned by the mayor, Sadiq Khan, are in the early stages of drawing up the proposal. The idea came from Ben Goldsmith, a financier and environment campaigner who is on the board of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The plan includes a selection of “core rewilding areas” on the outskirts of London, which could involve turning parts of the Thames estuary into a wetland teeming with wading birds and other wildlife, and releasing beavers into the marshes around the periphery of the capital. Beavers have already been released in Enfield, to the delight of locals, and there are more set to be released in Ealing later this year. These will then be connected by “nature corridors” that could run alongside train lines and on brownfield sites crisscrossing the city, which the wildlife could travel along. This would also create new wild green space for people to enjoy. The third prong of the plan is to involve Londoners, who will be encouraged to bring nature into their gardens, window boxes – and even on to their roofs. Shirley Rodrigues, the London deputy mayor for environment, said: “In London there are differences in how people can access green space – this isn’t just an environmental issue, it is a social justice issue. We have academics, practitioners, youth campaigners, all helping us with this project. People are massively excited about this – people were so excited about the beavers being released in Enfield, they want to see more nature in London.” Goldsmith, who has been tasked with looking at viable areas to rewild, said: “The plan is to develop Knepp-style rewilding projects around the periphery of Greater London in such places as the Dagenham Marshes; at Enfield, where a big nature restoration project is already under way; and in the Colne valley. These areas will be London’s core nature areas with real ecological integrity. “We must look to create connectivity in the form of threads of nature crisscrossing the city, north-south, east-west, making use for example of the banks on either side of railways, canals and rivers.” The team is also discussing the creation of new “microparks” inspired by those in Japanese cities, to increase access to green space in nature-deprived areas and to act as “stepping stones” for wildlife. It may seem surprising that Goldsmith, the brother of Khan’s former foe Zac, who ran against him during a fractious mayoral campaign in 2016, is working closely with the mayor to make the capital wilder. But it seems the brothers and the mayor have let bygones be bygones. “We made friends,” Goldsmith said. “I met Sadiq at a meeting at the Cop26 in Glasgow and we spent some time together and had a nice chat. I suggested that a rewilding taskforce in London would be a really exciting innovation, not least given London is making strides on all kinds of aspects of the climate agenda.” And the mayor immediately signed up. “He was wildly enthusiastic about it,” the conservationist said. Goldsmith, who is in the process of rewilding his own estate in Somerset, which currently boasts beavers and wild boar that he says came of their own accord after a suitable habitat was created for them, used his contacts to help create a group of experts who are bringing wildlife back to the capital. The group includes the UK’s most famous rewilder, Isabella Tree, whose success at Knepp Castle has made headlines worldwide. She has recently reintroduced beavers to the estate, and her work has brought back species including nightingales and storks to the Sussex countryside. Another expert is the RSPB’s Nick Bruce-White. The bird charity’s regional director for southern England has been drafted in to consult on how to bring various bird species back to London and improve the habitats across the city. “We are talking about bringing back species along the Thames such as redshank, and lapwing. So there are some areas already where those birds are starting to come back, such as our Rainham Marshes reserve, but the Thames estuary would have once been an absolute haven for breeding waders and all sorts of duck species over the winter – and geese as well. And skylarks, all that kind of stuff. So, we’d be creating a really wild kind of estuary,” he said. And the group is insistent that the rewilding movement will be a community campaign. Rodrigues said: “The point of talking about it as an urban taskforce is it isn’t just a few landowners changing their land – the point of it is we are being told about how excited people are about seeing nature introduced, it is important for health, for flood and climate resilience, it’s something everyone can be involved with.” Bruce-White agreed and said the new rewilded areas would be open for the people of London to enjoy. “We want people to connect with and enjoy these places,” he said. “They should be wonderful places to go. If people aren’t connected with nature and connected with their landscapes then we’re all doomed, probably, aren’t we? Nature only wins when people care about it.”",News/Environment,"Birds, beavers and microparks: experts plan to rewild London",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/13/birds-beavers-and-microparks-experts-plan-to-rewild-london
5/13/2022,"The effort to install local election officials who promote Donald Trump’s lie that the 2020 election was stolen has seen particular success in the crucial swing state of Georgia, where at least eight county election officials are promoters of the falsehood, a Guardian investigation has found. The officials span the state, from suburban counties outside Atlanta to rural counties near the Tennessee and Alabama borders. All have substantial power over the administration of local, state and national elections in their counties, often with little oversight beyond scantly attended public meetings and small-town newspapers. They include:  one election official who has posted in support of a discredited election conspiracist who believes the alleged presence of bamboo in paper ballots is proof they came from Asia, and thus show interference from China;  two officials who tried, on the basis of bogus fraud allegations, to decertify the results of the January 2021 runoff that resulted in the election of the state’s first Black senator;  one official who insisted that Georgia’s election laws needed to change if Republicans were going to “have a shot” at winning future elections. All continue to serve in their appointed positions as county election board officials in Floyd, Forsyth, Gwinnett, Hall, Jackson, Lumpkin and Spalding counties. None responded to requests for comment from the Guardian. The investigation looked at seven counties out of 159, meaning the number of election officials who support election conspiracy theories could be much higher. “These disturbing facts bring to light what we’ve known for a while: support for the big lie is growing – the result of powerful political actors stoking a dangerous fire,” the voting rights group New Georgia Project said in a statement. “There is absolutely no place on our boards of elections, or in any of our elected offices, for leaders who refuse to accept the results of fair and certified elections.” Election boards have access to voter rolls, and make rules about polling places, ballots and voter registration. They also make determinations on ballots in which the voters’ intention is unclear. The boards seat between four and five members, usually split evenly between the two main parties with a tie-breaking, “non-partisan” member often chosen by the county commission or a local judge. With 159 counties, Georgia therefore has hundreds of county election board officials, creating and changing election policy on a weekly basis with little other than local activists and press to track them. Among them is Dottie Krull, a 79-year-old Republican on the Lumpkin county election board, located a little over an hour north of Atlanta. Shortly after the 2020 election, Krull began posting about the big lie on her personal Facebook page. “I guess we all know why Biden stayed in his basement and didn’t campaign,” Krull quoted a friend as saying. “He knew he didn’t need to.” In Forsyth county, elections board member Joel Natt was present on a conference call with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and other election officials when he blamed unspecified election “irregularities” as a reason why Georgians of both parties were becoming “less and less trusting” of Raffensperger’s office. In Floyd county, Pam Peters was described by an election conspiracy theorist who spoke to the Washington Post as an “investigative partner.” Days before election day, Peters volunteered for Trump in Rome, Georgia. In Hall county, elections board member Tom Smiley said he took issue with claims that the 2020 election saw no fraud, saying he would amend it to “NO FRAUD DISCOVERED”. Perhaps no elections board official has been the subject of as much controversy as Alice O’Lenick, chair of the Gwinnett county board of registration. O’Lenick has been a vocal supporter of restrictions to poll access and voting rights, her critics say. In 2016, O’Lenick opposed the use of Spanish-language ballots. (The county was eventually forced to include them by the US Census Bureau under the Voting Rights Act.) She has also supported the abolition of so-called “no excuse” absentee voting, in which only the elderly or infirm would be allowed to fill out an absentee ballot; opposed the use of drop boxes, alleging spurious claims of ballot harvesting; served on a task force that recommended sweeping changes to voting rights so Republicans could “at least have a shot” at winning elections; and alleged without providing direct evidence that Gwinnett county saw an uptick in attempted voting by undocumented immigrants. In Spalding county, election board chair Ben Johnson continues to post prolifically about a wide variety of far-right conspiracy theories, including those involving alleged ballot harvesting and Dominion voting machines. In late April, Johnson shared a photo from a Canadian news outlet that had been altered to proclaim that conspiracy theorists “keep getting things right”. In Jackson county, Republican election board officials Larry Ewing and Jeff Hughes, following a campaign by the national conservative group True the Vote, forced an investigation into 211 people who had voted after recently changing their address, in the unsubstantiated belief that up to 2,000 Jackson county residents who had recently changed their addresses could have voted illegally. The pair also refused to certify the runoff election of Raphael Warnock, the state’s first Black senator, until the 211 names were passed on to the secretary of state for further investigation. The results were eventually certified with their dissent. “I can’t stress enough how widespread the election fraud lies have taken hold in the area,” said Pete Fuller, chair of the Jackson county Democratic party. “It’s very disconcerting how effective the misinformation has been.”",News/US news,Revealed: supporters of Trump’s big lie work as election officials across Georgia,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/13/trump-big-lie-georgia-election-officials
5/13/2022,"To musician Tarun Nayar, mushrooms sound squiggly and wonky. Nayar’s “organismic music” project Modern Biology has only been active since last summer but, with his videos of mushrooms making calming ambient soundscapes, he’s already racked up more than half a million TikTok followers and 25m views. The electronic artist and former biologist hangs out in mushroom circles, spending summers in the northern Gulf Islands of British Columbia with the Sheldrake brothers: Merlin, the author of the bestselling Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds and Shape Our Futures, and producer-songwriter Cosmo. So it seems only natural that he would begin foraging mushrooms – not to eat, but to listen to. Nayar makes, in simple terms, “plant music”: it is created by connecting electrodes and modular synthesisers to plants and measuring their bioelectrical energy, which then triggers note changes in the synthesiser. He describes the process as “an environmental feedback mechanism. It’s based on galvanic resistance – the same principle by which simple lie detectors work.” We’re effectively hearing the changes in resistance represented as bleeps and bloops, like retro-futuristic music harking back to the very early days of experiments with synthesisers. The first time he experimented with plants was on one of those summers away with the Sheldrakes. Nayar saw a thimbleberry plant growing outside his cabin, connected the leaves to a software synthesiser playing the piano, and listened. Nayar and others like him believe that these experiments with plant sonification are vital in forging deeper connections with the natural world. “When people are doom-scrolling on TikTok and all of a sudden a little mushroom pops up, that’s a moment of reconnecting, even if it’s through a phone. If music and tuning in more deeply can bring us here right now, then there’s hope.” For North Carolina-based electronic musician Noah Kalos, AKA MycoLyco, “just being able to find a signal that we can really observe helps to raise awareness that fungi are all living, we’re all part of the same thing.” Like Nayar, Kalos has gone viral with videos of his experiments connecting synthesisers to shrooms to create trippy beats. “In my work I’m picking up signals and using them artistically. To experience that level of interaction definitely helps you feel more connected.” Another person also experimenting with plant sounds is Joe Patitucci, the CEO of Data Garden, a “data sonification” company whose PlantWave app translates plant biodata into music. Aided by the app, he has just released a record from cannabis plants, aptly named 420. “The value of listening to plants is really about being super-present in the moment with nature,” Patitucci says. “It’s a reminder that we’re all part of this same system. I would hope that when people make that connection, they understand that destroying Earth is destroying ourselves.” It was this sense of environmental urgency that motivated sonic artist and “biophilic systems designer” Mileece to explore creating soundscapes from plants more than 20 years ago. She is one of the pioneers in this field, though she points to the 70s book The Secret Life of Plants that inspired a documentary film, and John Lifton’s Green Music, based on the bio-electric sensing of plants’ response to their physical environment, as influences in her work. Mileece has spent tens of thousands of hours developing software and hardware to translate bio-emissions (ie electricity and data) from plants into what she calls “aesthetic sonification”. She builds immersive, responsive environments that translate the interaction between plants and humans into music. One 2019 installation at Tate Modern, London was a pod full of plants and flowers that reacted to people entering and moving around the room. Underpinning her creations is a mission to educate communities on climate change and the threats to biodiversity – the work stemming from her early days experimenting with plants and electronics in her bedroom. Mileece began working at a time when there was less acceptance around environmental justice or the climate crisis; getting funding for her projects was a long and difficult process. “I was called all sorts of bad words for being an environmentalist. And there is no difference between what Greta Thunberg says and what I said, but everyone kind of hated me for it.” As a teenager, Mileece learned to code and trained as a sound engineer. In her mid-20s she became the resident artist at the London School of Economics, where she developed a way to transcribe the electrical signals from plants into the basic elements of sound design. She shows me a photograph of an early experiment. On her desk sits a potted plant with hair clips attached (she’d made her own electrodes), connected to a custom-made module and synth she’d coded herself, and linked up to what is now a vintage Mac computer. It has been a long journey for her, and only now is she witnessing the sudden virality of people plugging synthesisers into mushrooms. “The fact that scientists and people in general are finally taking this all seriously has been the point of my work all along, and precisely why I worked so hard not to let it be a gimmick,” she says. A cute video of a cactus appearing to sing might feel like a gimmick, but Mileece, Nayar and others work with plants because they say there is no experience like it: finding that understanding of how a natural element is interacting with their home-built technology. The music has a story to tell, too. MycoLyco has soundtracked a Stella McCartney show; the designer has used mycelium – grown from mushrooms – as a leather substitute. For Mileece, it has always been about forging connections between people and the planet. “It’s to help people remember how much better off we are when we are integrated with the Earth, so we don’t ruin it for ourselves or all the other animals, insects and birds.” At the very least, these botanical soundscapes might bring some people closer to understanding the natural world – even if they come across a video for just a few seconds.

5/13/2022,"On the fashion rental platform My Wardrobe HQ, there is a black tulle Dolce & Gabbana dress that has been worn “at least three times in the last month” as a wedding dress, said its customer services adviser Rachel Higgins. “The customers say, ‘Oh my God, it’s the perfect dress.’ I think the white [wedding] dress is seen as a bit dated now.” UK searches on Pinterest for black wedding dresses are up by 85% compared with last May, as brides-to-be rip up the rulebook and instead investigate looks that express their individuality. “Who says you can’t wear black?” asks Kate Halfpenny of the bridal wear company Halfpenny London, who has introduced a “black edit” of her most distinctive silhouettes. “The past couple of years have taught us to seize every opportunity to be ourselves, and brides are choosing whatever their hearts desire.” It’s a trend that has been rumbling along ever since Sarah Jessica Parker wore black to her wedding in 1997, as did Pearl Lowe in 2008. In 2019, Christine Quinn of the US reality TV series Selling Sunset wore not one but two black wedding dresses, and in 2020 Chloë Sevigny covered her baby bump with black in a secret wedding. And with nuptials back on the agenda, the trend is tipping into civilian life. “The pandemic brought about a real independence, with brides breaking with tradition,” said Martha Tobyn, a wedding stylist and the founder of Anemone Style. “Now we are seeing women follow their own style with more confidence.” When the 33-year-old creative director Lydia Pang got married in 2019, she wore a black ruffled silk organza dress by Roberts|Wood. “Everything about the wedding was about making sure we did it our way,” she said. “Black is my absolute favourite colour – I find it flattering and it makes me feel confident and calm. I felt like the absolute best version of my daily self.” Like many couples, they got engaged after being together for several years – so the symbolism of white just isn’t relevant nowadays. Of course, the choice for modern brides isn’t just black or white – in between are colourful dresses, short dresses, jumpsuits, suits … but black brings maximum impact. “Black shakes up the traditional expectations of a wedding – it goes against the grain,” said Tobyn. It was Queen Victoria who in 1840 popularised the white wedding dress when she married Prince Albert in a white, lace-covered gown. Before that, brides could choose any colour, not least so that it could be worn again and not show the dirt. Since Victorian times, a dress that would most likely only be worn once has been regarded as a status symbol; nowadays, that’s not considered very sustainable. Black wedding dresses aren’t exactly mainstream, but that’s part of their appeal. “If a bride wants an edgy look, yet still be super chic and glamorous, a black dress ticks all those boxes,” said Halfpenny, adding, “Most of us have that perfect black dress which is our go-to and makes us feel amazing.” Vera Wang, who has offered a collection of black wedding dresses since 2011, has said that a bride in black is “sexy”. Wearing a black gown is going to bring extra attention, though, and the etiquette expert Jo Bryant cautioned against buying into the trend for the sake of it. “Heads will turn and people will chat. If you are known for your unusual style, you can expect everyone to wonder what you’re going to be wearing before you come up the aisle. But if you’re not a fashionista, I think it would cause quite a lot of surprise and may be something you’ll regret.” That said, a black dress can mitigate more immediate regrets, said Tobyn: “A white wedding dress will show up any spillages, grass stains or pollen from your bouquet. With a black dress, none of that happens.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Nice day for a black wedding: brides ditch white for dramatic gowns,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/13/nice-day-for-a-black-wedding-brides-ditch-white-for-dramatic-gowns
5/13/2022,"The detection of messages through the TV or newspaper has long been a symptom of psychiatric unease. On Monday, the New York Times made a jittery decision to pull the answer to that day’s Wordle, lest players, unnerved by the tenor of public life in the US right now, divined a communication from dark forces via the puzzle. A week after the leak of a draft opinion from the supreme court outlawing Roe vs Wade, the Wordle answer – set last year and surfacing this week through sheer coincidence – was “fetus”. Halfway through the morning, it was replaced with “shine”. Four hundred miles away in Bangor, Maine, genuine messages were showing up on the sidewalk. Relative, say, to the murder of an abortion doctor or the hurling of abuse at women entering a branch of Planned Parenthood, chalk on the pavement was a fairly benign delivery system for political sentiment, applied in this case to the tarmac outside the house of Susan Collins, Republican senator for Maine, and in the preferred tone of the Democratic left: condescension coupled with vague passive aggression. “Susie, please,” implored one neatly written message in blue chalk, beseeching the senator, who claims to be in favour of a woman’s right to choose, to rethink her own regrettable life choices. “Mainers Want WHPA,” read another, referring to the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2021 and as a slogan, lacking the punch of, say, “abortion is murder”. Nonetheless, Collins called the police, who declined to do anything on the basis the messages were not “overtly threatening”. Back in Washington, what the anti-abortion side lacked in finesse they were making up for in blue-sky thinking. Standing before the Senate, Steve Daines (R) of Montana observed that, were Democratic legislation on abortion to pass (it didn’t), sea turtle eggs might enjoy more rights than foetuses, a point he illustrated with a large poster of turtle hatchlings alongside some human babies. If the senator had thoughts about the relative value of reptile to human life, the disinclination of women to lay eggs on the beach, or the cost of putting an unwanted turtle through college, he did not include them in his presentation. Here he was, the future King Charles III, subbing in for his mother at the opening of parliament. What a lot of medals! He looked like Jason Isaacs playing Field Marshal Zhukov in the Armando Iannucci satire, Death of Stalin. I have gone through phases of feeling sorry for Prince Charles, with his sad air and all that hanging around. In recent years, his peevishness has benefited enormously from comparison to Prince Andrew’s personality, alongside whom Charles appears practically noble. On the other hand, the dress rehearsal on Tuesday was not a cheerful affair. Concern for the Queen dampened the spirits of many observers, but it wasn’t entirely that. Despite the pomp – or perhaps, given the times, because of it – the spectacle seemed simultaneously dreary and starkly deranged. In the 90s, when Prince Charles was widely disliked after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, it was popular to voice the opinion that the crown should skip over him and go straight to William. As a thought experiment even that, now, fails to solve the problem of what to do with these unlovely people, William not seeming too clever these days and looking more like a Mountbatten each year. For those with affection for the crown, all eyes must turn, in hope and desperation, towards the blameless outline of poor, young Prince George. It’s childish to take joy in crypto going belly up, and I say that as someone who owns it. I got into bitcoin too late, was up $373 at Christmas and as of Wednesday, am down $244. (As you can tell from these figures, I am not Warren Buffett.) But with the markets tanking, and any sane pension-holder averting their eyes from their balance for at least six months, somehow crypto getting a kicking lifts the spirits. I feel the same way about all those collapsing NFTs – pure schadenfreude, plus irritation at not understanding any of it. A sentence from Forbes this week: “The sell-off comes after the $18bn algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) lost its peg to the US dollar, wiping out the price of its support coin luna which has now lost almost 99% of its value.” If these words make you feel rage, panic and despair in equal measure, cheer up: Brian Armstrong, the founder of the crypto exchange platform Coinbase, was worth $13.7bn last November and is now practically down to his last $2bn. The company value itself is down 75% this year, while almost $1tn in value has been wiped off the main cryptocurrencies. That fear and inertia that kept you out of the gold rush turns out – didn’t you always suspect it? – to have been secret genius. The funniest word in the English language is, according to my children, “butt-cracker”, but really any compound with “butt” in it will do. On Thursday, a school board in Mississippi voted to uphold a decision to fire a teacher for reading the book I Need A New Butt (sample line: “I need a new butt! Mine’s got a crack / I can see in the mirror a crack at the back”) to his second-grade class, deeming it “inappropriate” material for seven-year-olds. The title, by the New Zealand author Dawn McMillan, is part of a series that includes I Broke My Butt, and My Butt Is So Noisy, three titles that are right up there with the Jonathan Stutzman classic, Butts are Everywhere – and all of which I’ve just been reminded to reserve at the library. On parenting sites across the US are desperate appeals for leftover baby formula, as snags in the supply chain empty the shelves. Running out of infant formula is, one assumes, a problem of precisely no interest to the foetus-rights advocates in Congress, since it attends to the demands of breathing, squalling infants, not notional entities with no overheads or needs. Besides which, human hatchlings famously don’t require much in the way of investment, nurture or specialised care; just leave them in the sand and they’ll find their way to shore.",News/UK news,Digested week: I feel pure schadenfreude about collapsing crypto,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/13/digested-week-i-feel-pure-schadenfreude-about-collapsing-crypto
