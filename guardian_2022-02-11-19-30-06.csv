2/11/2022,"Benjamin Disraeli famously warned against putting too much store in statistics, and the latest growth figures are a perfect example of why the former prime minister was right. On the face of it, 2021 was an absolutely corking year for the economy. Britain has had some boom years in the postwar period – 1973 and 1988, for example – but the 7.5% growth last year was the fastest of the lot.  Yet 2021 can’t be seen in isolation. Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are correct when they say the UK had the fastest growth in the G7 last year, yet what they normally omit to add is that it came after the UK had the biggest contraction of any G7 nation a year earlier. The real story is that the economy collapsed by almost 10% in 2020 and then recovered most of the lost ground last year. Activity in the final three months of 2021 was 0.4% lower than in the final three months of 2019 – the period immediately before the pandemic struck. By way of comparison, the eurozone is back to where it was pre-Covid while the US is operating more than 3% above its level in late 2019. Unsurprisingly, 2021 ended on a weak note as the arrival of the Omicron variant led to tougher government restrictions and a more cautious mood among consumers. The impact of cancelled Christmas parties and emptier high streets meant activity in the hotel and restaurant sector fell by almost 10% between November and December, while retail was down by more than 3%. The 0.2% contraction in the economy as a whole in the month of December was slightly smaller than economists had predicted, in part due to increased health output as the vaccine programme was ramped up and more people used NHS test and trace. Statistically, 2022 will be another strong year and it is possible the UK will again top the G7 league table. Again, it would be wise not to get too carried away because most forecasters expect the economy to slow markedly in the second half of the year as higher taxes, rising energy bills, increased borrowing costs and a squeeze on incomes combine to hit spending power. In his response to the growth numbers, Sunak said the economy had proved “remarkably resilient”, helped by £400bn of spending from the government. But that support is now being drastically scaled back. A lot more resilience will be needed in what is shaping up to be a challenging period ahead.",News/Business,Don’t get carried away with statistics: the UK still faces big economic challenges,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/11/lies-damn-lies-why-last-years-uk-economic-growth-cant-be-seen-in-isolation
2/11/2022,"Ian McDonald, a co-founder of two era-defining groups in prog band King Crimson and rock outfit Foreigner, has died age 75. A representative said he had “passed away peacefully on 9 February in his home in New York City, surrounded by his family”. No cause of death was disclosed.  McDonald was part of the original lineup of King Crimson, who formed in 1967 in Dorset. A multi-instrumentalist, McDonald became the band’s primary composer. After a breakout support slot with the Rolling Stones in Hyde Park, London, on 5 July 1969, they released their debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King, in October of the same year. It received critical acclaim and is now considered a classic. Pete Townshend of the Who called it an “uncanny masterpiece”. And Kanye West sampled McDonald’s instantly recognisable, swaggering saxophone from the song 21st Century Schizoid Man – originally recorded in a single take – on his 2010 single Power. McDonald told Ultimate Classic Rock that he wasn’t surprised the album had held up for more than 50 years. “When we made it – and I was basically at the forefront of the production – I wanted to make sure everything that went into the record would bear repeated listening and hopefully stand the test of time.” The band’s original lineup went their separate ways at the end of 1969, with McDonald and drummer Michael Giles diverging from the darker styles preferred by guitarist Robert Fripp. The departing pair released one album together, 1970’s McDonald and Giles, which reflected their poppier approach to prog. McDonald briefly rejoined King Crimson in 1974 before Fripp put the band on hiatus – though he would play with Fripp again in the 50-strong prog-jazz group Centipede, led by British free jazz pianist Keith Tippett. In 2002, former members of King Crimson, minus Fripp, reformed as the 21st Century Schizoid Band. McDonald formed Foreigner in 1976, alongside British guitarist Mick Jones (not the Clash guitarist) and US singer Lou Gramm. He appeared on the first three of their four consecutive five-times platinum-certified albums, but was sacked in 1980 as Jones sought greater control over the group. “I wouldn’t have left,” McDonald told Big Bang magazine. “I loved the group, it was not my decision.” However, he occasionally played with the band at later reunion shows. Between King Crimson and Foreigner, McDonald appeared on four of the biggest-selling albums of the period from 1969-79. As a session musician, he performed on T-Rex’s 1971 single Get It On. He also collaborated with Fairport Convention co-founder Judy Dyble (who was also fleetingly a member of pre-fame King Crimson), Steve Hackett and Asia. McDonald released his first solo album, Driver’s Eyes, in 1999, which featured contributions from Hackett and Peter Frampton. In 2017, he formed the band Honey West, which counted his son, Maxwell, among its members. McDonald was born in 1946 in Osterley, Middlesex. He played guitar as a teenager and developed his musicianship while serving five years in the British army as a bandsman, where he learned clarinet, flute, saxophone and musical notation. His love of big band jazz evolved into a love of rock’n’roll, which, he told Billboard magazine in 2017, “didn’t seem like a great leap to me. There was a great energy there that appealed to me”. Reflecting on his career to Billboard, he said: “I have trouble processing time in terms of years and weeks and months. I mean, it’s 40 years for Foreigner, almost 50 years for King Crimson – but it feels like milliseconds. It’s a lot of good work, though.”",Arts/Music,Ian McDonald: King Crimson and Foreigner co-founder dies age 75,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/11/ian-mcdonald-king-crimson-foreigner-co-founder-dies-age-75
2/11/2022,"Kanye West has said he won’t perform at the Coachella festival unless fellow headliner Billie Eilish apologises to rapper Travis Scott, after she appeared to reference the fatal disaster at Scott’s Astroworld festival during a recent show. Performing in Atlanta last week, Eilish stopped proceedings when she noticed a fan struggling to breathe. After the fan received medical attention, she resumed the show and told the crowd: “I wait for people to be OK until I keep going.”  On Instagram, West (now legally known as Ye) shared screenshots of a news report about Eilish “dissing” Scott, captioned: “Come on Billie we love you please apologise to Trav and to the families of the people who lost their lives no one intended this to happen. “Trav didn’t have any idea of what was happening when he was on stage and was very hurt by what happened and yes Trav will be with me at Coachella but now I need Billie to apologise before I perform.” Eilish responded in the comments of West’s post: “Literally never said a thing about Travis. Was just helping a fan.” Eilish’s comment in Atlanta was widely interpreted as a reference to the tragedy at Scott’s Astroworld festival in Houston in November 2021. Ten people died as a result of accidental compressive asphyxiation in a crowd crush, with approximately 300 people injured. The youngest victim was nine-year-old boy Ezra Blount. Speaking to Rolling Stone, Blount’s grandparents described West’s remarks as “hurtful” and “idiotic”. Scott continued to perform while first responders were attending to what was described as a mass casualty event, and completed his performance. Analysis by the Washington Post showed that crowd members’ attempts to sound the alarm were drowned out by Scott’s music. Scott has denied knowing that fans were hurt during his performance, and subsequently denied responsibility for the deaths in court documents after more than 140 lawsuits alleging negligence were filed, including a mass litigation suit brought by more than 1,500 concertgoers. In December, a judge ruled that the 10 deaths were accidental. Scott and event organisers remain a focus of a criminal investigation. Nobody has yet been charged. The Coachella festival is due to take place in California across two weekends in April, with Harry Styles as its third headliner.",Arts/Music,Kanye West won’t play Coachella unless Billie Eilish apologises to Travis Scott,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/11/kanye-west-coachella-billie-eilish-travis-scott-apology

The promiseCold compresses are a great reliever of swelling, and using something small with a tip should (in theory) be effective on dilated blood vessels. The question is whether an old lipstick is the best tool for the job. TikTok seems to think so.  The testEveryone from cold-bath enthusiast Wim Hof to Hollywood legends (Joan Crawford splashed her face with cold water 25 times each morning) has extolled the virtues of “icing” your face to increase circulation and reduce inflammation. But this is needlessly time-consuming. First, I removed the lipstick remnants from the bullet with a cuticle stick (time: 30 minutes). Then I cleaned it with rubbing alcohol to avoid bacterial contamination (10 minutes). Finally, I filled the tube with water and put it upright in the freezer (three minutes by propping it up with vegan Magnums). Next day, behold: a tiny ice roller. Using it in circles around my eyes was cooling – and it did depuff the area a little – but no more than a cold flannel or ice cube in clingfilm would have done. My dark circles were unchanged and the ice melted in about 30 seconds. The verdictResolutely style over substance.

2/11/2022,"The question of where 27-year-old Raveena Aurora fits in the current pop climate is an interesting one. Her independently released 2019 album Lucid was critically acclaimed, but her major-label debut inches her towards the mainstream, at least in theory – it’s both dazzling and impressively eclectic.  Among the guests lurk not just Vince Staples – on the fantastic, Neptunes-esque Secret – and avant-garde LA singer-songwriter-producer Tweaks, but Asha Puthli. The Bombay-born singer’s extraordinary career takes in everything from collaborating with Ornette Coleman to ethno-fusion, to a brace of revered, idiosyncratic, oft-sampled disco records. Here, Asha’s Kiss feels like Raveena’s loving homage to the dreamy, drowsy atmosphere of Puthli’s mid-70s classics Space Talk and Flying Fish, a mood that predominates in the album’s second half. Elsewhere on Asha’s Awakening, the influence of exploratory early 00s hip-hop and R&B production is strong: the warped rhythm tracks of Kismet and the stuttering beats of Magic, and the tabla drums on Time Flies, which carry something of Timbaland’s experiments with Indian percussion samples. There are ambient interludes, with names such as Arrival to the Garden of Cosmic Speculation, alongside straightforward pop bangers. Or at least relatively straightforward: the disco-fied Kathy Left 4 Kathmandu features a twisted off-key guitar sample that seems to underscore the prickly mood of its exploration of western attitudes to eastern spirituality. The album ends with a 13-minute-long “guided meditation” called Let Your Breath Become a Flower. It is questionable whether anyone not seeking mindfulness would ever listen to this twice, lovely as its drifting tones are, but its presence underlines that Raveena is a noticeably different proposition to her peers. Mainstream pop music should clear some room for her: it would make things infinitely more interesting.",Arts/Music,Raveena: Asha’s Awakening review – dazzling and eclectic,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/11/raveena-ashas-awakening-review-dazzling-and-eclectic
2/11/2022,"At first glance, the construction along the Brooklyn streets appeared routine. “You wouldn’t think anything of it,” said Fabian Rogers, a community organizer in Brownsville, a majority Black neighborhood where construction began in 2017.  It wasn’t until years later, in 2020, that he learned that the overturned streets were making way for a fracked gas pipeline. “It just felt like a big slap in the face – to have [a pipeline] in my backyard that I didn’t know about,” he said. Rogers and other residents have spent the last two years protesting National Grid’s 7-mile pipeline, which zigzags through predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods, bypassing whiter, wealthier parts of Brooklyn. Formally known as the Metropolitan Reliability Project, the pipeline is often referred to as the north Brooklyn pipeline. They have blocked the pipeline’s construction at demonstrations and some have stopped paying part of their utility bills, in an effort to divert funding from the project. Last summer, they went a step further filing a complaint against the utility and state that argues the pipeline has resulted in racial discrimination, violating Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. (Title VI prohibits federally-funded entities from discriminating on the basis of race, gender, and other protected identities). Historically, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been slow to act on these types of complaints, rarely finding evidence of discrimination. But under the Biden administration, the agency has committed to change this. How the EPA responds to this challenge – in which Black, Indigenous, and brown-led community groups say a fracked gas pipeline represents a violation of their civil rights – will be a test of the agency’s ability to execute on that promise. Not long after the complaint was filed, two federal investigations were launched into New York state agencies. The lawyers behind the complaint hope that it will result in a full environmental review of the pipeline and connected facility for storing and refining the methane gas, which awaits an air permit. Ultimately, they hope that the gas in the pipeline – which began operating in 2020 – is permanently shut off. “It would be a real mistake if the state doesn’t listen to the communities that it is designed to protect – that already have a history of dealing with environmental harm and pollution,” says Britney Wilson, a co-counsel to the complaint and an associate law professor and director of the Civil Rights and Disability Justice Clinic at New York Law School. The pipeline cuts through the designated environmental justice areas of Brownsville, Ocean-Hill, Bushwick and East Williamsburg, neighborhoods long overburdened with toxic hazards from a history of racist policies. Large swaths of these neighborhoods were historically redlined, ineligible for federally backed loans. All neighborhoods have some of the highest rates of adult and child asthma in New York City, a legacy of its history of polluting industries and lack of public benefits. The pipeline has a terminal in Greenpoint, where one the largest oil spills in the country is still being remediated. “National Grid treated Brownsville like a backyard, but there’s a whole community back here,” said Rogers. “Folks have been supporting each other. Folks have been making it happen.” Responding to a request for comment, a National Grid spokesperson maintains that the utility company complied with all laws. The EPA was established just over 50 years ago. In that time, the agency has only made one final finding of discrimination. In 2017, the agency reached the conclusion that the permitting process for a power plant in Flint, Michigan, was effectively discriminating against African American residents. But it took the EPA more than 20 years to reach that point; the complaint against the Genesee Power Station was first submitted in 1992. The Center for Public Integrity found that the EPA rejected or dismissed over 90% of the civil rights abuse allegations, from 1996 to 2013, while only 5% of complaints were resolved with voluntary or informal agreements. To date, the agency has not once restricted federal funding for a civil rights violation. But under the Biden administration, there have been signs that the EPA wants to put environmental justice at the forefront of its policies. In October, the agency released a strategic plan draft that aims to revamp its civil rights enforcement program. The plan states the EPA will “vigorously enforce” federal civil rights law to “address the legacy of pollution in overburdened communities that results from discriminatory actions, whether direct or indirect, intentional, or unintentional”. This reflects a sharp departure from both the Obama and Trump administration’s strategic plans, which didn’t mention civil rights – let alone make it a central objective. “This could possibly be a turning point with how the EPA approaches environmental racism,” said Anjana Malhotra, a senior attorney at the National Center for Law and Economic Justice and a co-counsel to the complaint. “It’s a landmark acknowledgement of how [the EPA] hasn’t addressed environmental injustice.” After community groups filed their complaint against the north Brooklyn pipeline, the EPA launched an investigation into New York’s department of environmental conservation, while the department of transportation began investigating New York’s public service commission. Those investigations are currently paused while the federal agencies meet with the state to seek an informal resolution. In a recent development, Malhotra and Wilson were invited to meet with federal agencies in January. There, the co-counsels presented a letter reiterating why it is “unequivocally clear” the environmental conservation department violated the law and to push for greater inclusion of their clients in the informal resolution. Typically, the process doesn’t include the complainants, but the EPA and transportation department are developing a new model to better include the impacted communities, according to Malhotra and Wilson. It’s an important development, given that Brooklyn residents claim they never had the opportunity to consent to the pipeline – a frequent complaint shared by environmental justice communities. “[National Grid] never reached out to me, never reached out to my fellow neighbors, none of us,” said Rogers, a member of Brownsville Green Justice, one of the groups behind the complaint. If no agreement can be reached, the investigations will resume – with a timeline of 180 days in total to potentially arrive at preliminary findings of discrimination. A DPS spokesperson claims the agency’s decision to approve the pipeline was based on “a robust factual record”, while a environmental conservation department spokesperson similarly claims that the agency “subjects every application to rigorous review of all applicable federal and state standards”. With regard to the EPA’s record on environmental justice, there are some promising changes. Marianne Engelman-Lado, a lawyer who has previously described the agency as “spectacularly unsuccessful at ensuring that recipients of EPA funding comply with the non-discrimination provisions of Title VI”, was appointed to the agency last year. The EPA has also issued two letters with preliminary findings of civil rights violations in 2021, for separate complaints in California and Missouri. And in September, the agency responded to an audit from the office of inspector general with measures and deadlines for improving civil rights oversight – from more guidance for permitting decisions to initiating investigations even before a complaint is lodged. These moves could mean good news for organizers like the ones challenging the north Brooklyn pipeline. “Our neighborhoods in Brooklyn have always been dumping zones,” said Pati Rodriguez, a community organizer with Mi Casa Resiste, a Bushwick-based group resisting gentrification and displacement, and one of the complainants. “[But] these are our neighborhoods that we’ve stewarded.”",News/US news,"‘Treated like a backyard’: pipeline violates civil rights, say Brooklynites",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/11/brooklyn-pipeline-violates-black-lation-civil-rights-new-york
2/11/2022,"Grief is not a medical disorder to be cured. Grief is not a spiritual crisis to be resolved. Grief is not a social woe to be addressed. Grief is, simply, to be felt in our hearts and our minds and our bodies. I’ve been writing about grief since my child died in 1994. I can remember – at the time – questioning myself. Was I grieving too much, for too long and too intensely? But a small, still, thankfully wise voice within my feminine self rejected these intimations. I knew that this precious relationship I had lost was worth every tear I shed. Every cell in my body hurt – a physical pain that emanated from the tips of my hair to the tips of my toes. I couldn’t eat: eating was for the living, and I was still uncertain I was alive. I couldn’t sleep because thoughts of her haunted me. I didn’t recognise myself in the mirror. The yearning for her was so intense that her absence lived in the centre of my heart. I was changed and I knew it would be an irrevocable loss. I died with her that day and, after nearly three decades, I still miss her.  Self-doubt, loneliness, fear, anxiety and the sorrow of not trusting oneself to grieve honestly are a tragic legacy – and something I often notice in those who lack strong support networks. A bereaved mother I recently worked with, whose child died in 1972, is only now reclaiming her experience of grief – and, thus, reclaiming her true self. She’s learning to reinhabit her physical, emotional and spiritual body after nearly 50 years of being utterly detached from herself and others. We can certainly avoid our grief, but we cannot avoid the consequences of doing so. Grief will disguise itself as something else, in our intimate and family relationships, in our minds and cognition, and also in our bodies. The sustained state of suppressed grief is fodder for disease.Today, we are witnessing the destructive psychological effects in this pandemic world, where so many have died, directly and indirectly, from Covid. The reclamation of who, and what, we are in the aftermath of tragic loss is a basic right as a living being on this broken and beautiful Earth. If you don’t know grief by now, one day I promise you will. Grief is the inevitable and worthy burden of loving another. It is an unstoppable and paradoxical force that creates and destroys. It moves in our bodies, it occupies the space between us and others, and it seeps through generations. And so, may our broken hearts land softly in the world, reverberating compassion towards others who know what it means to suffer. Perhaps, one day, when grief is finally venerated, it will inspire peace instead of war, tenderness instead of violence, and love instead of hate.

2/11/2022,"In all honesty, I have no idea why I decided to go on Mastermind. I love pub quizzes, sure, and I’m good at them. Pre-Covid, I was part of a crack team called Quizlamic State, who regularly took home first prize in our local one. As team coordinator, I developed a reputation for ruthlessness, brutally ejecting friends and, on one occasion, my boyfriend, if I thought they were underperforming. At university, I was picked for our college’s University Challenge team, though we didn’t get on the show: too boring, apparently. (The producers picked a team of historical re-enactors and archers from a different college.) All of this stuff is what I say when people ask why I went on the show. But if I’m being honest, I don’t know why I did it. I don’t know why I do most things. I’m an incredibly impulsive person; always have been. To paraphrase Kim Kardashian West’s reply when asked why she filmed the sex tape that made her famous: because I was bored, and I felt like it.  I guess if I’m honest, I thought it would be a win-win situation. Nail Mastermind, in which case I have lifelong bragging rights; or don’t, in which case I’ll have a funny story I can write about. Here’s the funny story. Another confession: when I apply for Mastermind, I haven’t watched it for years. How hard can it be? I think, with the breezy optimism of a rookie journalist thumbing a lift into a war zone. In late May, I fill out an online form and, to my surprise, get a call the following day. The first round is a Zoom interview and quiz with a friendly Northern Irish casting researcher. (Mastermind is produced for the BBC by Hat Trick Productions, which has offices in Belfast.) “You did great!” he says when I correctly name Virginia Woolf’s artist sister. (Vanessa Bell.) I feel a childish jolt of self-satisfaction. The email comes through the following day: Well done on being shortlisted for this series of Mastermind! I’m told that hardly anyone gets picked for the show, which inflates my confidence. “Your score in the trial was very impressive,” says a producer in a congratulatory phone call. (I later wonder if the producers zeroed in on me because I am a woman of colour, not because I was particularly good: historically, Mastermind has been an overwhelmingly white, male show.) Next, to pick my specialist subject. The answer comes quickly: the Kardashians. I know everything about that wretched family: their plastic surgeon (Raj Kanodia), the high school they went to (Marymount High), the designer of Kim’s house (Axel Vervoordt.) The opportunity to scrape some utility from this knowledge, like penicillin from mould, is too good to pass up. But alas, I’m not allowed to. (“We can’t accommodate the Kardashians this series,” says a cryptic email from the producers.) Nor am I allowed my second choice (Spice Girls), or my third, the novels of Jane Austen – there are only six major ones, so I figure revision will be easy – as both subjects have featured too recently. I’m floundering. There’s nothing else I want to do. I consider the novels of Hilary Mantel, but they’re so long, and I’ve only read them once. At this point, I go dark on the producers, but they keep calling me from unknown numbers, asking if I’ve got another specialist subject. Flailing, I cast out the TV show I’ve been binge-watching during lockdown: ER. Yes, they say. That could work. ER it is. This, I later realise, is why some people tank their specialist subjects on Mastermind. It seems the producers can refuse many of a contestant’s choices, leaving them to tackle subjects they don’t feel comfortable with. The contestants then don’t have as much time to swot up as they would like. So they bomb. Three contestants have scored just one point on their specialist subject to date, and my heart goes out to all of them. To my credit, I realise my insane folly a week later, when it becomes clear that I’ve got to rewatch all 331 hour-long episodes of ER in under six weeks, before the show is filmed in early July. I send a panicked email. Please, I beg yet again: can’t I just do the Kardashians? They are unmoving but, after some horse trading, the producers and I settle on an inspired compromise: I will focus only on the character of Dr Doug Ross in ER, who handily exits the show as a recurring character in season 5, and, even more handily, is played by George Clooney, in a career-defining role. For the next six weeks, I eat, sleep, and breathe Clooney, which, in all honesty, makes for the most fulfilling and erotic revision experience of my life. I listen to Setting the Tone, an ER podcast, when I’m brushing my teeth in the morning and getting ready for bed at night. I cancel my plans and instead stay in and watch ER every evening, watching Clooney save a boy from drowning in a storm drain while wearing a tuxedo, punch child abusers, and do that classic Clooney shtick of tilting his head down then looking up with those hangdog puppy eyes. It is rough going. Euro 2020 derails my revision but, as July rolls around, I’m feeling good. I know Dr Ross’s job title (paediatric fellow) and the names of his parents (Ray and Sarah) and how many children he has (a trick question – most people think it’s two, but he also has a son he mentions briefly in the first series). In the park a month before filming, a friend tests me on my general knowledge. I get two questions right out of 20. “I think the questions are easier than that,” I say breezily. He looks doubtful. “That’s … the official Mastermind quiz,” he says. Itouch down in Belfast for filming, carrying a selection of wardrobe options at the producers’ request, and three pages of revision notes. (“Wear a fancy top!” says a producer brightly in a wardrobe briefing phone call.) The hotel is full of Mastermind contestants, which makes for a surreal dinner, each of us sitting alone, all of us side-eyeing each other, assessing who has the most bountiful general knowledge of them all. I nod at the man on the table next to me, without acknowledging that I know why he is there. A middle-aged woman returns from filming and begins talking about it on the phone. “Like being at school,” she shudders. I choke on my burger. By the following morning, a small animal is doing yoga in my stomach. We shuffle into a conference room for the obligatory pre-filming briefing and are given paperwork to sign. To my right, two contestants are whispering about a woman in the second row. (“Wasn’t she on Eggheads?” I overhear one mutter to another.) I return to my room for last-minute revision and begin to unravel. Part of the problem is that I’ve seen the other contestants’ revision folders, which are the Gutenberg Bible to my SparkNotes. But there’s nothing to be done and, before I know it, a researcher is walking me and three other contestants to the studio for our heat. The contestants chat among themselves about other quizshows they’ve been on. Virtually all of them, it seems, are old-timers: they’ve been working up to Mastermind for a few years. My mouth is suddenly very dry. A lovely makeup artist does her best to calm my nerves – really, she is so kind and, more importantly, my makeup looks great – and then it’s time to face the chair. The chair. How best to describe the Mastermind chair? It is spotlit, well worn, imposing. Its leather has been burnished by the arses of minds far greater than mine, minds capable of retaining all manner of trivia while staying cool under pressure and not panic-sweating profusely via their bum cheeks on to the seat; cellulite-free grey matter, crammed full of general knowledge like a suitcase you have to sit on to close. My mind, by comparison, is a duffel bag containing a single pair of socks. Because of Covid protocols, there is no studio audience, which is a blessing, because it gives the whole game an oddly low-stakes feel. A floor manager instructs us to stare into a camera while the Mastermind music thunders. Da da da da … DA DUH. The floor lights are raised. DA DUH. What am I doing here? Clive Myrie, the host, nods me into the chair. I’m first. He asks me my name and specialist subject, then we’re away. I get a couple wrong, a couple right. At the end of my specialist subject round, I’ve scored eight points, which is a respectable though not particularly impressive score. I definitely would have done better if I’d had more time to revise, as many of the questions were on minor plot points for episodes I’d only watched once, but lots of them I’d predicted, and did get right. In all honesty, it was fun. I enjoyed it. (Although I did bolt out of the chair when my round was done, and had to be reminded by producers to sit back down, so Myrie could tell me how I did. Apparently this happens often.) After everyone else has had their turn, I’m in joint third place for the specialist subject. Which is fine; I didn’t seriously expect to win. I sigh in relief and observe the other contestants. One won’t stop slouching in their chair. Producers stop filming and ask them to sit up straight, but they refuse and slump back down again within minutes. I aspire to their level of sang-froid. When Myrie beckons me to the chair again, I realise that, for all my cramming about dishy Dr Ross, I’ve completely omitted to even think about the general knowledge round. All my energy and focus has been on not tanking my specialist subject. Walking back to the chair, I think: should I have prepared for this? Could I have prepared for this? I fumble the first question, which is maddeningly easy – a question about tennis that I know, but wasn’t listening to properly – and just like that, it all falls apart. I can’t seem to hear the questions properly, like I’m in an aeroplane and my ears won’t pop. The only sensation I can compare it to is the time I jumped off a waterfall in South America and, while freefalling through the air, realised I had badly misjudged the angle and was about to land on a rock. Uh oh, I think, as Myrie pummels me with question after question I have no answer for. This is going to hurt. I emerge, dazed and metaphorically bloody, with a paltry four points, leaving me with an overall score of 12. To my eternal shame, I spend the next five minutes actively wishing for all the other contestants to do worse than me. Annoyingly, they do not. The final scores are 17, 16, 16 and 12. Reader, I came last. Dazed, I collect myself enough to congratulate the winner, and watch, amused, as the slumper scowls all the way back to their dressing room. I’d have killed for their score, but they’re clearly devastated. They probably think I’m an amoeba. Back at the hotel, I call my boyfriend and deliver the news. After a pause, he says: “Probably not worth it in retrospect. All that effort and you came last.” I consider never telling anyone about this ever, but I’d stupidly posted on social media about applying for the show, and my editor saw it and asked me to write this piece, and it felt wormlike to weasel out – even though writing this has, at times, felt like acupuncture with a drill bit, or watching every embarrassing thing I’ve ever done on an Imax screen. (Besides, I tell myself, as I lie awake at 2am, it’s not like I got the lowest-ever score on the show. That honour goes to athlete Kadeena Cox, who scored just three points on her specialist subject of Arsenal on the Celebrity edition, and none on general knowledge. I wonder how she’s doing.) What lessons can I learn from my tale of televised quizzing mediocrity? That Mastermind is harder – I would go as far as to say considerably harder – than a pub quiz. That next time I feel like doing something dumb and impulsive, I should get another piercing. That the best way to transcend shame is to lean all the way into it, make it a funny story, and come out the other side: because the only thing worse than a person who flubbed Mastermind is a person who can’t laugh at themselves. Oddly enough, I actually don’t regret it that much. I still love quizzes. I definitely didn’t do well, but I did go for the grandfather of all quizshows as a complete newbie with barely any revision, like scaling K2 without supplemental oxygen, in winter, on my first attempt at climbing. Next time, I’ll try a gentle walk up Ben Nevis first. Something straightforward, like The Weakest Link or Pointless. Until that day, I’ll return to the comfortable camaraderie of my Quizlamic State teammates.

2/11/2022,"A British company has fallen foul of Greta Thunberg, Unesco, Sweden’s national church, and the indigenous people in the north of the country over plans for an open-pit mine on historical Sami reindeer-herding lands. The clamour of opposition was voiced as Beowulf Mining, headquartered in the City of London, suggested it was “hopeful” of a decision within weeks of a 5 sq mile iron-ore mine in an area where Sami communities have lived for thousands of years.  The company’s share price has been on a sharp upward trajectory since December when the Swedish Greens, who have opposed the plans, left the governing coalition and the Social Democratic business minister, Karl-Petter Thorwaldsson, declared that his party “loved mines” and hoped to open more. But the proposed Gállok site, located 28 miles (45km) outside the town of Jokkmokk in the county of Norrbotten in Swedish Sápmi, commonly known as Lappland, has become a symbol of what has been condemned as a callous and unlawful disregard for the protected status of Sami culture by big business and government. The Sami parliament, the representative body for people of indigenous heritage in Sweden, has in recent days written to the Swedish government warning that the mine will destroy grazing areas and cut off the only viable migratory route for reindeer followed by the Jåhkågasska Sami community, who move westerly with their animals to the high hills of the Laponian area on the Norwegian border for the animals to calve during the spring. Sami communities to the west and east of the mine would also be hit through a reduction in viable grazing areas already under pressure from changes to the snow conditions attributed to the climate emergency, logging, power lines and the development of a hydroelectric dam, the parliament said. Unesco, the UN’s cultural protection wing, has warned of a potentially “large, very large” impact on the Laponian area, the mountainous world heritage site 21 miles west of the mine, counselling the Swedish government to undertake a more “in depth” assessment. The archbishop of Uppsala, Antje Jackelén, who heads the Church of Sweden, has written an open letter to the Swedish prime minister, saying the proposed mine “is not existentially and spiritually sustainable”. Thunberg, speaking to the Guardian during a visit to the Gállok site, said the government’s decision would be pivotal to Sweden’s future reputation. “The world’s eyes are on the Swedish government,” she said. “The profit that will be made from this mine will go to the British company not the local people who will have to pay for the long-term costs: the polluted air, water, lost biodiversity and lost traditions. “Of course we need local jobs, but it cannot be at the expense of the climate, environment, indigenous rights. The Sami villages affected by this mine have clearly said, ‘No.’ A no is no and we need to respect that.” Thunberg added: “Sweden’s government usually pretends it is a progressive country when it comes to human rights and when it comes to the climate and environment. “We usually call ourselves pioneers and climate leaders but when you see what is happening here it is the exact opposite. It is a textbook example that we still have not come to terms with history and that we are continuing in the same way we have always done, there are no signs of us backing down. “It is just more and more of the idea that we can exploit other people, that we can exploit nature, and that needs to be brought to an end.” Thunberg’s comments were echoed in a joint statement on Thursday by Maya Kaqchikel, the UN’s special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, and David R Boyd, the body’s special rapporteur on human rights and the environment. “We are very concerned by the lack of good-faith consultations and the failure to obtain the free, prior and informed consent of the Sami, and over the significant and irreversible risks that the Gállok project poses to Sami lands, resources, culture and livelihoods,” they said. “There has been insufficient assessment and recognition of the environmental damage the mine will cause.” Beowulf has been seeking approval for the mine since April 2013 but has consistently faced steep opposition in the Sami community, only strengthened by public relations missteps. In 2014, the former chairman Clive Sinclair-Poulton was filmed in a boardroom, with a photograph of the site, telling investors: “One of the major questions I get is what are the local people going to go ahead and say about this project. And I show them this picture and I say, what local people?” A year later, when asked whether it would be difficult for the Sami to successfully oppose the proposed mine, Sven-Erik Österberg, the county governor in Norrbotten, told a documentary-maker: “Of course there is a lot of money in the area and, you know, money talks.” Despite this, Alice Bah Kuhnke, a former minister for culture, who is now a Green MEP, said her party had to make sacrifices on other issues when in government to prevent their Social Democratic coalition partners from giving the mine approval. Unesco’s intervention has been dismissed as “inappropriate” by Beowulf. The company’s chairman also complained that the Church of Sweden prematurely backed “one side in a sensitive and conflict-filled issue”. Karl Budge, Beowulf’s chief executive, declined to be interviewed by the Guardian due to a family bereavement, but he pointed to a statement issued to shareholders earlier this week to “clarify facts and challenge certain misinformation”. “The future conditions for mining and reindeer husbandry to coexist at Gállok are possible, learning from local Sameby [unions of Sami], their knowledge, and from the many examples across Sweden where coexistence is a reality,” Budge wrote. “The company is committed to doing all it can to achieve this, through preventative and precautionary action and compensation deemed necessary.” Beowulf claims its project will create 250 direct jobs and more than 300 indirect jobs in Jokkmokk during its initial 14-year lifetime. The company says there is potential for it to be working for 25 years if further iron ore deposits are identified. The company further suggested that “reindeer can be moved around an obstacle, such as a mine, using specific fenced corridors, Eco ducts [bridges] or even trucks”. The issue has divided the 4,800 people who live in Jokkmokk. The Social Democrat mayor, Robert Bernhardsson, who also declined to be interviewed, said in a written statement that the mine was necessary to reverse a decline in population over the last decade which stood at about 7,000 in the 1990s. “For Jokkmokk, which has routes of between 220km to 340km to other municipal centres, it is especially important to have a strong local business community and job growth,” he said. Henrik Blind, a Green member of the municipal board from the Sami community, said tensions in Jokkmokk were such that “people don’t like to talk about it”, but that those whose culture was at stake had to be heard. In its statement, Beowulf said iron mineralisation of up to 389m tonnes had been identified at Gállok and the mine would represent just 0.5% of the Jåhkågaska community’s available pasture lands of 1,019 sq miles. “You can show anything with statistics,” said Jonas Vannar, 42, a reindeer herder from Jokkmokk. “If you compare it to someone shooting an arrow to your heart, it’s a pretty small hole when you calculate the area of the wound compared to the entire body. Then it’s surely not possible to die from an arrow in your heart?”",News/Environment,‘Sami people have said “no”’: British firm’s plans for open-pit mine divide Sweden,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/11/sami-people-said-no-british-firms-plans-open-pit-mine-divide-sweden-greta-thunberg
2/11/2022,"On a clear day from the beaches of Yeonpyeong, a tiny South Korean island, you can see the coast of North Korea some 12 km (seven miles) distant. Glance down, however, and you might see something else. Amid the tangle of seaweed and greying driftwood, the chunks of bleached polystyrene and shreds of fishing net, there may lurk bits of brightly coloured plastic. To the untrained observer, these scraps – sweet wrappers, cigarette cartons, instant noodle packets, all covered in oversized script, vivid colours and garish cartoon characters – might only confirm the Yellow Sea as one of Earth’s most polluted marine environments. To the sharp-eyed, however, encoded in the design of these snippets is valuable information about the society from which they originate: North Korea, virtually a closed shop to the rest of the world.  The first person to appreciate this was Kang Dong-wan, a professor of politics at Dong-A University in Busan, South Korea. Kang has spent the past year collecting 1,414 wrappers from the beaches of some of South Korea’s most far-flung outcrops. Until Covid, he had studied the North from across the demilitarised zone, catching its changing slogans with powerful lenses. When access to his vantage point was closed off, Kang relocated. The Five West Sea Islands were occupied by the South at the end of the war and now form the de facto maritime border between the two countries. Yeonpyeong, the closest island to the North, was the subject of a tit-for-tat artillery barrage in 2010 that left four dead and led to the evacuation of about 80% of the island’s 2,000 residents. “The most surprising thing,” says Kang, speaking from the island where he continues to scour the beaches, “was just how much garbage made it here.” The professor has turned the fruits of his foraging into a book, Picking Up North Korean Garbage in the Five West Sea Islands, which divides the litter into categories: sweets, baked goods, drinks, dairy products, foodstuffs, seasonings, liquor, cigarettes, medical supplies and sundries. “With this rubbish,” he says, “I can see into the lives of North Koreans.” Foremost among the preconceptions shredded by Kang’s scraps is the idea that the country is unsophisticated, that what goods there are are basic. “The packaging is surprising in its refinement,” he says. Perhaps most surprising, he adds, is the way products from the North mirror those of the South. “In a capitalist economy,” he says, “packaging and design are tailored to appeal to consumers.” You might expect things to be different in a repressive communist regime, but Kang believes otherwise: “Not even North Korea can completely ignore the desires of its people.” Take the wrapper for Galaxy Candy with Strawberry Cream Inside, made in the Pyongyang Wheat Flour Factory in North Korea. It is covered in bright drawings and colours, with a cat suspiciously reminiscent of Sanrio’s Hello Kitty. This more elaborate packaging reflects recent changes, says Kang, as North Korean producers have developed sleeker branding. This is partially a consequence of reforms that followed Kim Jong-un’s accession in 2011, heralding a liberalisation of the economy. Simultaneously, an increase in smuggling has made North Koreans familiar with products from abroad. This more refined packaging is an attempt to compete. The trash also offers a glimpse into factory conditions, says Kang. Ingredient lists and production dates reveal what North Korea has been able to make itself during the pandemic, and what it is forced to import with its dwindling cash reserves. Packaging, too, will often specify what factory a product was made in. If it’s known to be operated by the military, this can indicate what the North’s soldiers are eating – as many such snacks are, says Kang, “supplied to the military. In general, the public don’t consume them. There is no money.” Even the material itself can hold clues. Newer trash, Kang explains, is often composed of recycled or locally sourced materials, a further indication of the North’s economic state. Perhaps their reasons are green, but it’s far more likely that recycling is being forced on them by scarce resources. Nick Bonner, who has written about North Korean product design, also sees the wrappers as a gauge of the North’s economic plight. “I would imagine over the next few months, as the sanctions bite harder and Covid keeps the border to China closed, there will be less and less garbage for Kang to pick up,” he says. “Sad for him but, more worryingly, a reflection of how tough its food and economic situation is.” In the meantime, however, Kang continues his shoreline vigil, adding to his haul with every new tide.",Arts/Art and design,‘I can see into the lives of North Koreans’ – the professor who reads washed-up rubbish ,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/11/north-koreans-professor-rubbish-sweet-wrappers-south-korea-military-secrets
2/11/2022,"Romance in your 30s is no puppy-love business: youthful idealism ebbs with each passing year, while regrets gradually encroach. Setting sail in the muddy waters of modern relationships, Shakun Batra’s star-studded Hindi drama shows that infidelity is never a simple affair.  Haunted by her parents’ unhappy marriage and her mother’s suicide, Alisha (Deepika Padukone) is stuck in a cycle of stagnancy that encompasses her yoga-instructor job and her boyfriend Karan (Dhairya Karwa). On a seaside weekend with her cousin Tia (Ananya Panday) and her fiance Zain (Siddhant Chaturvedi), Alisha is paradoxically attracted to and unnerved by their lavish lifestyle, whose flashy allure starkly contrasts with the modest home she shares with struggling writer Karan. When Zain makes a brazen pass at her, it spirals into a torrid flurry of hotel sex and illicit messages. Promises of commitment are exchanged only to be delayed, as Zain’s real-estate business depends on investment from Tia’s parents. What starts out as a breezy liaison soon warps into a resentful brew of paranoia. While the lurid twists and turns are enjoyable in a 90s erotic thriller kind of way, the sudden shift towards suspense hampers Padukone’s performance. And what a performance it is! Though Alisha is caught up in crisscrossing relationships, in her few solitary moments an aching sense of loneliness emerges as she is let down by every male figure in her life. While Padukone lights up the screen, Gehraiyaan could have used the economical writing of Ijaazat (1987) or Masoom (1983) – two classic and, to be honest, better films about romantic betrayal.  Gehraiyaan is released on 11 February on Amazon Prime Video.",Arts/Film,Gehraiyaan review – Deepika Padukone mesmerises in a torrid drama,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/11/gehraiyaan-review-deepika-padukone-mesmerises-in-a-torrid-drama
