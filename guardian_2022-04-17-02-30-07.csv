4/17/2022,"In the final analysis, it was impossible not to zero in on the moment when Zack Steffen wished he could be anywhere but here and Liverpool assumed a vice-like grip on this FA Cup semi-final that it was difficult to see them relinquishing. Poor Steffen. Pep Guardiola had wanted to show his faith in the backup goalkeeper but it all went wrong for the US No 1 and Manchester City in the 17th minute. Addressing a routine back-pass and under the usual orders to play out Ederson-style from the back, Steffen took a heavy first touch and, after some hesitation, an even heavier second one. In flew Sadio Mané to tackle the ball into the net for a 2-0 lead and Liverpool were on their way to a final against Chelsea or Crystal Palace – and, they hope, the second element of an unprecedented quadruple. Liverpool’s dominance of the first half was total and it would get worse for Steffen when he conceded softly for 3-0 at his near post from Mané. City responded in the style of champions in the second half, Jack Grealish pulling one goal back, and after Alisson made a save to deny Gabriel Jesus they hinted at the outlandish when the substitute Riyad Mahrez crossed in the 90th minute, the ball hit Alisson and Bernardo Silva turned home at the far post. Guardiola’s side had the chances in stoppage time to force extra time as the latest clash between these rivals produced yet more drama. Fernandinho blasted high while Raheem Sterling shot low at Alisson but City had left themselves with too much to do. Guardiola made seven changes from the team that started the second leg of the Champions League quarter-final at Atlético Madrid on Wednesday night and one of them was Steffen. An abiding image would come after the full-time whistle when he sank down sadly on to his haunches and had to be consoled by some of his teammates. City’s war of attrition in Madrid had framed plenty of the buildup and it prompted Guardiola’s sweeping rotation but it was not if they could hog this particular line. Liverpool too are in the throes of a punishing programme and they have home league fixtures in the coming week against Manchester United and Everton, their two biggest rivals. Even so, the relative strength of the starting lineups appeared to have given Liverpool the edge, with Klopp recalling his big guns after Wednesday’s Champions League tie at home to Benfica. It was Ibrahima Konaté, one of the few Liverpool starters not considered a first-choice selection, who put his team in front. Red smoke drifted across the stadium from flares lit inside the Liverpool end and their supporters sang their songs at full volume. At that early point, they believed it was their day and the feeling only intensified when Steffen suffered his horror moment. City simply did not turn up at the start, even if Grealish, playing as the false nine, did have a fourth-minute shot blocked by Virgil van Dijk. The atmosphere had crackled at the outset, although it was disgraceful that a section of the City support refused to keep quiet during the pre-match silence for the 33rd anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster. The Liverpool support booed them and the referee, Michael Oliver, had to cut short the remembrance. Konaté’s goal was all about his power and desire – but it was made by the most perfectly flighted of outswinging corners from Andy Robertson, an invitation to the central defender that would have been indecent to pass up. Konaté outmuscled Jesus and then got up higher than Nathan Aké. It was a towering headed finish; Konaté’s third goal for Liverpool and his third in three games. City had looked edgy in the opening exchanges and got an attempt to play out from the back all wrong in the sixth minute. Was it a portent for Steffen’s indecision? While Klopp had stuck with Alisson having started his No 1 in the previous round at Nottingham Forest, Guardiola went with Steffen after picking him in all but one of City’s previous domestic cup ties this season. Liverpool’s third goal just before half-time was exhibit B for the prosecution because Steffen was horribly slow to get down and across on Mané’s volley, which was slashed towards the near corner. The Liverpool buildup had been of a piece with their enjoyment of the first-half, all assured touches and movements that were too quick for City. The excellent Thiago slipped in between two sky-blue shirts before swapping passes with Trent Alexander-Arnold and the flighted pass out right to Mané was made to measure. City, who struggled to suppress the electric Luis Díaz, needed something at the start of the second half and they got it. Fernandinho won the ball and released Jesus up the inside right channel. He produced a lovely jink inside Fabinho and then sent a square pass to Grealish, who made a difficult finish look easy. City were a different proposition now: they squeezed higher and played with more urgency and aggression – even a note of anger. Could they find a second to ignite a contest? Jesus ran on to a Sterling touch to work Alisson at the near post and they crafted the big chance on 71 minutes – a one-on-one for Jesus after a Grealish throughball. Alisson got down to block. Before that, Fernandinho flirted with a red card when he stretched into a bad tackle on Mané – he got away with a booking – but, after Salah almost capitalised on Oleksandr Zinchenko’s loose back header, City made their last-gasp push. It was not enough.",Sport/Football,Liverpool survive Manchester City scare to reach FA Cup final after Mané double,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/16/manchester-city-liverpool-fa-cup-semi-final-match-report
4/17/2022,"The long buildup to next Saturday night’s world heavyweight title fight between Tyson Fury and Dillian Whyte, in front of a record crowd of 94,000 at Wembley Stadium, was strangely muted and even uncertain for months. An all-British showdown between the outspoken Fury and Whyte, who is such a raw and jolting talker, should have conjured up an entertaining prelude. Instead, the silence was broken only by complaints from the Fury camp about Whyte’s elusive absence from all promotional duties and rumours of constant bickering between the rival camps. Then, last Wednesday, there was a dramatic and explosive twist when the US Treasury confirmed that it had imposed sanctions against Daniel Kinahan – the controversial Irishman who has long been a friend and adviser to Fury. Kinahan, who has been investigated by the Irish police for years because of his alleged leadership role in a drug cartel associated with his family, is now based in Dubai. Kinahan, who has no criminal convictions and has always denied any wrongdoing, had emerged from hiding with growing frequency over the last year. His obvious desire to sanitise his reputation by becoming the most powerful man in boxing emboldened him. There have been copious social media posts of Kinahan smiling cheerfully alongside some of the many fighters he advises, including Fury again earlier this year. But his troubling confidence has hit an almighty road-block. The US government has stressed that it is a priority for President Biden and his law enforcement departments to bring the full weight of their considerable powers to bear against the Kinahan cartel which an American state spokesman compared to mafia groups in Italy, Japan and Russia. A reward of $5m has been offered to anyone who can help secure the arrest of Kinahan, his father, his brother and their closest associates. Suddenly, speculation over the reasons for Whyte’s silence and apparent refusal to attend an earlier press conference, and whether the fight might even be cancelled, seems very tame. Even a world heavyweight title extravaganza appears redundant when the attention surrounding it is led by the US government stressing its determination to crack down on “a murderous organisation”, international money laundering and “deadly narcotics” which leave devastation in their wake. The Americans also made blunt warnings that everyone in boxing should sever all ties with Kinahan. A day after those extraordinary announcements Fury and Whyte finally appeared on a Zoom media conference call in front of around 100 journalists from America, Britain and Ireland. Of course it was engineered so that the only reporters invited to put any questions to Fury were those intent on swapping ingratiating greetings with him or asking him about his golf swing, his faith or how it will feel to fight on St George’s Day. Kinahan’s name was not mentioned once in over 50 minutes of banality, deception and stupidity. It was a shameful day for the charade of boxing journalism. At least the fighters themselves chose not to trade in duplicity or sanitisation when describing what is likely to happen when they face each other in the ring. There was no attempt from either Whyte or Fury to dress up the brutality of a heavyweight scrap in flowery clichés about the noble art or the sweet science. They did not discuss the complex psychology or rigorous discipline of boxing. The challenger and the champion spoke about violent mayhem and their apparent relish for danger and hurt. “Listen,” Whyte said. “I know what I am, and I know what I bring. I’ve got a lot of pain and frustration to take out on someone and it looks like it’ll be Tyson Fury. So let’s go.” He then added: “You know me. I come with maximum violence. I’m ready for it.” Fury was more jocular. “A lot of boxers look forward to what they’re going to do after the fight,” he suggested. “They’re going to go out, go on holidays, take time with their family, but not me. I like to enjoy every second in that ring. And for me it goes very quick. Even if it’s a 12-round fight, it goes like 10 minutes. I wish they would do a fight for a full-day long, like a full day of fighting. That would be more my style. I’d enjoy it. I just enjoy getting punched and punching someone in the face. Absolutely fantastic.” Fury was only half-joking. “For people who know what I’m talking about, they’ll understand. Other people would think: ‘That’s something a lunatic would say.’ But I’m really happy when I’m in the boxing ring, getting thumped in the face and, after climbing off the canvas or a big dramatic finish, it’s all very entertaining for me. I really look forward to it all. “For me, it’s not like: ‘Ooooh, I’m going to the guillotine before a fight.’ It’s like: ‘Damn! I’m going to be on TV!’ It’s amazing. I’m really happy to be getting paid for a job that I absolutely love to do.” Whyte has been written off by many but he has overcome great tumult, deprivation and violence in his life. Last year, when describing how he had almost starved to death in Jamaica as boy, fathered a child when he was just 13 and been shot and stabbed in London, Whyte told me: “I was born in a storm. Adversity is the story of my life.” He will not fear Fury and, rather, he is likely to be bolstered by the fact that the champion was knocked down four times in his dramatic trilogy of fights against Deontay Wilder. Fury has incredible powers of recovery and he remains unbeaten and the dominant force in heavyweight boxing. One day, the diminishing impact of those heavy blows will become obvious. But the Gypsy King is convinced that he operates at a far higher level of skill and power than Whyte – who insists that “I’m used to being the underdog. I’m used to climbing up hills and mountains and struggling. But I just persist and keep pushing and keep burning, man, because that’s all I’ve ever done. I just grind and grind and grind.” Blaming his absence from earlier promotional duties on unresolved contractual disputes, Whyte said he is now ready to play his full part in fight week: “People forget that you need two hands to clap. It’s not the Tyson Fury show. Everybody’s saying: ‘Tyson Fury this, Tyson Fury that.’ But this is the Tyson Fury and Dillian Whyte show. We’re going into this fight together so everything needs to be done correctly. I’m a warrior, I’m a survivor, so I don’t dance in no-one’s shoes. We can dance together but it can’t be one-way traffic.” The bleak truth for boxing is that, despite both fighters’ aptitude for brutal drama, this will not just be the Fury and Whyte Show. Whatever happens in the ring at a heaving and roaring Wembley late next Saturday night, the real battle for boxing’s diseased soul will be decided elsewhere. A more serious showdown awaits between US law enforcement agencies and the reviled Kinahan cartel. A knockout victory for the Americans would be the sweetest outcome for the battered old business of boxing.",Sport/Sport,Fury and Whyte’s showdown overshadowed by battle for boxing’s diseased soul | Donald McRae,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/16/tyson-fury-dillian-whyte-showdown-overshadowed-by-battle-for-boxings-diseased-soul
4/17/2022,"On Friday Joe Root resigned as England captain and this was one of the better recent days for the England and Wales Cricket Board. It was, at least, one clarification amid a fog of uncertainty. There is no chairman at the ECB, no cricket director (though the expectation is that Rob Key will be appointed after the Easter bank holiday), no coach and now no Test captain. Not much room for complacency here. England have not been so rudderless since 1988, the summer of four Test captains. The assumption is that Root jumped rather than being pushed since there is no one around at the ECB to push him. Key, as a Sky pundit, has been critical of his captaincy but I doubt that was decisive. Root has had time since the Caribbean tour to think and sit down with his nearest and dearest, and he has reached a logical conclusion. I’m happy to join the chorus about Root: that despite limitations he has been a captain utterly devoted to the job, to the game and to his players, and that he should be applauded for his time in charge. England have had many worse captains. But there is no divine right to remain in charge. It was time for a change; in fact change was overdue but, after the Ashes, the paucity of options dictated that Root should continue in the Caribbean. Now for his own sake and that of the team it is time to try someone else. He should depart with his head held high. To general relief but no surprise he has reaffirmed his dedication to playing Test cricket. Now, when the gulf between England’s best player (Root) and the rest has never been greater, they desperately need his runs. His departure spares Key, if he is to be the new director, a tricky conversation. Key’s probable appointment has raised a few eyebrows. One oddity is that the list of those who have declared they are not interested in the job seems much longer that those fancying the position, which does not reflect well on the ECB. To be employed by England is no longer regarded as a plum posting; it is far more desirable to get an IPL gig for eight weeks or even a jolly month in charge of one of the Hundred teams. The same might apply to the position of head coach, to which Key has presumably already given much thought. If Key is appointed in the week ahead he may be the beneficiary of the paucity of candidates but he has obvious attributes. He is an independent, coherent thinker, unafraid to challenge some of the accepted orthodoxies. Moreover he is prepared to pop his head above the parapet. The pattern in England is that the heavyweights (I’m the rule-proving exception here) head to the commentary box for a much cosier life, pontificating without responsibility. For example, the media commitments of Mike Atherton, Nasser Hussain and Michael Vaughan, all well-qualified to plot the path ahead, debar them from having significant positions within English cricket. It is easier to pin down the candidates to be the next England captain than the next coach. England’s best coaches – Duncan Fletcher, Andy Flower and Trevor Bayliss – have come from overseas but increasingly the big names are drawn to India. Key might have to be at his most persuasive to net one of them. However it is almost unprecedented for anyone to turn down the England captaincy. When contemplating his choice Key must surely avoid looking too far ahead. It is lovely to announce “a five-year plan”, which is often just a cunning ruse to explain away the latest debacle and as meaningless as a “red-ball reset”, but the goal must be to get through the 2022 season without too many calamities rather than planning for 2024. In consultation with the new coach the ECB may have to go for a stopgap captain to take charge for the first four Tests of the summer (three against New Zealand, one against India) before reassessing. Sometimes the stopgap can surprise, the best example being Ray Illingworth in 1969. He was drafted in as the perfect dispensable stopgap after Colin Cowdrey’s achilles tendon had snapped: he was 37 and had been no more than a sporadic England player; he could hold the fort until Cowdrey’s return. Illingworth ended up doing the job for four years and winning the Ashes in Australia. An enforced change can pay dividends. In 2022 it is highly unlikely that England will pluck someone from the county circuit. The new captain will surely be familiar with the international setup. There are three serious candidates, all with shortcomings. The frontrunner is Ben Stokes. Does he want the job? I doubt he could turn it down. But should we consider the experiences of the charismatic cricketers of the past when appointed captain, such as Ian Botham, Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen? Yes, we should, which enhances the idea of a short- term appointment. The England captaincy does not have to be a four-year presidential term. Stuart Broad was the captain of two unsuccessful T20 World Cup campaigns in 2012 and 2014 but that should not be held against him. At 35 he might struggle to be ever-present, which should not debar him either. The third option, Jos Buttler, was also absent in the Caribbean. He was legitimately dropped after the Ashes but he has a sharp brain, the experience of 57 Tests, the respect of Root and Stokes, and a Test batting average higher than that of Rory Burns. So the pundits can speculate gleefully while Key becomes increasingly aware that there are no perfect solutions.",Sport/Sport,Stopgap captain could be perfect for England after Joe Root’s overdue exit | Vic Marks,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/16/stopgap-captain-could-be-perfect-for-england-after-joe-roots-overdue-exit
4/17/2022,"Criminals could be forced to attend sentencing hearings if new rules reportedly being considered by the Ministry of Justice are brought in. The regulations are apparently being considered after the killer of Sabina Nessa refused to hear his sentencing verdict at the Old Bailey on 7 April. The schoolteacher, 28, was murdered in a park in south-east London by 36-year-old garage worker Koci Selamaj. He was jailed for a minimum of 36 years for the crime, but was not there to hear the judgment, or impact statements from the victim’s family. Nessa’s sister, Jabina Nessa, called Selemaj a coward for “not facing up to your responsibility and for what damage you have done to our family”. The Sun quoted a government source as saying that the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, is looking into the policy change “very carefully”. A government source confirmed to the Guardian that the plans were being considered. They said: “He has increased funding for victims by 85% and pushed forward the victims’ law because he believes victims should always be at the heart of the justice system.” Steve Reed, Labour’s shadow justice secretary, echoed the sentiment. “Judges need the power to force offenders to literally face justice in court, instead of refusing to attend court and causing more unimaginable grief to victims,” he said. Shadow prisons minister Ellie Reeves told Times Radio: “Victims aren’t at the heart of the criminal justice system.” She said Labour wants judges to be able to hold criminals in “contempt of court” if they refuse to attend their sentencing in order to shift the balance “back to victims from the perpetrators of crime”. People “want to see those who have committed horrendous crimes to be held to account for what they have done,” she said. “We haven’t even got a victims’ code on a statutory footing in this country – we have been promised it time and time again.” The current victims’ code provides statutory guidance on victims’ rights and sets out the minimum standard that organisations must provide to victims of crime.",News/Politics,Refusal of Sabina Nessa’s murderer to attend sentencing may prompt new law,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/16/refusal-of-sabina-nessas-murderer-to-attend-sentencing-may-prompt-new-law
4/17/2022,"Perhaps these two-legged knockout ties will catch on. The suspense of a tight, tense and relentlessly physical contest was prolonged into the final minutes in Limerick when it remained impossible to call a winner; at least until Damian de Allende’s try, eight minutes from time, that proved the knockout blow. Munster emerge battered but victorious from a high-class collision between unstoppable force and immovable object, and with a last-eight match against either Ulster or Toulouse looming into view. Joey Carbery, the Munster and Ireland fly-half, scored 21 of their 26 points but this was fundamentally a defensive masterclass by Johann van Graan’s side and one that evoked memories of the good old days when they won this competition twice in three seasons between 2006 and 2008. It was in particular a mammoth individual display by Peter O’Mahony in the back row, the captain who refused to allow Exeter time to settle at the breakdown and caused a nuisance at their lineout into the bargain. Exeter huffed and puffed but, as so often this season, failed to find the necessary cutting edge to decisively end the resistance of determined opponents. They may still make the Premiership playoffs but it will take a remarkable recovery - and a rediscovery of that old killer instinct - for this campaign to count as anything other than a desperate disappointment. It had all began brightly enough for Rob Baxter’s side, too, who went into this second leg with a five-point lead following the first leg at Sandy Park. The visitors spent much of the first quarter with ball in hand, sometimes attempting to run through Munster’s red-brick wall, at other times looking to the fast hands and dancing feet of Sam Maunder and Henry Slade for a touch of magic. The Devonians crossed the try-line early thanks to a fine sniping finish by Maunder which also prompted a yellow card for Murray. But if anything, Exeter failed to fully capitalise on their early territory, which was due in no small part to committed and clever work at the breakdown by O’Mahony, Jack O’Donoghue and the rest of the Munster side. O’Mahony, switching from that fierce competition at the breakdown to temporary scrum-half after 25 minutes, fizzed a fine pass in the direction of Carbery who easily jinked past Harry Williams, the prop, and ran in Munster’s first try from close range. The extras were added by Carbery and the seven-pointer put Munster ahead in the tie for the first time. Joe Simmonds thumped a long-range penalty wide with the final kick of the first half, and it was abundantly clear that a nervous second half awaited in Limerick. The Irish province had achieved no fewer than seven turnovers in the first half, conceding just three penalties, and the turnover issue was one Rob Baxter would have addressed urgently at half-time. The second half began to unfold in much the same vein as the first: Exeter in possession, smashing into contact, the ranks of Munster defenders lining up dutifully to absorb another impact. But matters swung in the visitors’ favour when Jacques Vermeulen powered over eight minutes after half-time. Simmonds sent the conversion against the post, and Carbery showed no such wastefulness with a couple of penalties that edged Munster back into the lead as the crowd willed them on. Munster were squeezing Exeter into the final 10 minutes. After Slade narrowly failed to pull off a brilliant interception, a scruffy pass made its way to Simon Zebo on the left wing, but the quality of the delivery did not matter. The Ireland international scorched down the outside before offering a world-class offload inside to De Allende, who performed a demonstrative dive over the line to send the home fans into ecstasy. “Dogged” was the word O’Mahony used to describe Munster’s performance. Yet another thing he got right.",Sport/Sport,Damian de Allende gives mighty Munster the edge over Exeter,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/16/munster-exeter-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report
4/17/2022,"As federal officials weigh efforts to fight the climate crisis against pressure to bring down high gasoline prices, the interior department is moving forward with the first onshore sales of public oil and natural gas drilling leases under Joe Biden. The move also calls for a sharp increase in royalty rates for companies, ostensibly to limit global emissions driving the climate crisis, though economists say the effect will be relatively small. The royalty rate for new leases will increase to 18.75% from 12.5%. That’s a 50% jump and marks the first increase to royalties for the federal government since they were imposed in the 1920s. Biden suspended new leasing just a week after taking office in January 2021. A federal judge in Louisiana ordered the sales to resume, saying interior officials had offered no “rational explanation” for canceling them. The government held an offshore lease auction in the Gulf of Mexico in November, although a court later blocked that sale before the leases were issued. Friday’s announcement comes as Biden faces pressure to expand US crude production after the pandemic and war in Ukraine have caused a surge in fuel prices and otherwise generally roiled the world economy. Last month, the Democratic president announced plans to release 1m barrels daily from the US strategic oil reserves to, as he put it, “ease the pain families are feeling right now” at the country’s fuel pumps because of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine. Yet Biden also faces calls from within his own party to do more to curb emissions from fossil fuels that are driving the climate crisis. Leases for 225 sq miles (580 sq kilometers) of federal lands primarily in the western US will be offered for sale in a notice to be posted on Monday, officials said. The parcels represent about 30% less land than officials had proposed for sale in November and 80% less than what was originally nominated by the industry. The sales notices will cover leasing decisions in nine states: Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Montana, Alabama, Nevada, North Dakota and Oklahoma. Interior department officials declined to specify which states would have parcels for sale or to give a breakdown of the amount of land by state, saying that information would be included in Monday’s sales notices. They said the reduced area being offered reflects a focus on leasing in locations near existing oil and gas development including pipelines. Hundreds of parcels of public land that companies nominated for leasing had been previously dropped from the upcoming lease sale because of concerns about wildlife being harmed by drilling rigs. At the time, officials said burning fuel from the remaining leases could cost billions of dollars in climate crisis impacts. Fossil fuels extracted from public lands account for about 20% of energy-related US greenhouse gas emissions, making them a prime target for climate activists who want to shut down leasing. Republicans want more drilling, saying it would increase US energy independence and help bring down the cost of crude. But oil companies have been hesitant to expand drilling because of uncertainty over how long high prices will continue. Friday’s announcement comes after interior officials had raised the prospect of higher royalty rates and less land available for drilling in a leasing reform report issued last year. “For too long, the federal oil and gas leasing programs have prioritized the wants of extractive industries,” said Secretary Deb Haaland. “Today, we begin to reset how and what we consider to be the highest and best use of Americans’ resources.” But the move brought condemnation from both ends of the political spectrum: Environmentalists derided the decision to hold the long-delayed sales, while oil industry representatives said the higher royalty rates would deter drilling. Nicole Ghio with the environmental group Friends of the Earth said Biden was “auctioning off our public lands to big oil”, putting oil industry profits ahead of future generations that will have to deal with the worsening consequences of the climate crisis. Meanwhile, American Petroleum Institute vice-president Frank Macchiarola said officials removed some of the most significant parcels that companies wanted to drill while adding “new barriers” that would discourage companies from investing in drilling on public lands. Lease sales and royalties that companies pay on extracted oil and gas brought in more than $83bn in revenue over the past decade. Half the money from onshore drilling goes to the state where it occurred. Most states and many private landowners require companies to pay royalty rates higher than 12.5%, with some states charging 20% or more, according to federal officials. The royalty rate for oil produced from federal reserves in deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico is 18.75%. In the November auction that was later canceled, energy companies including Shell, BP, Chevron and ExxonMobil offered a combined $192m for offshore drilling rights in the Gulf. New leases that are developed could keep producing crude long past 2030, when Biden has set a goal to lower greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50%, compared with 2005 levels. Scientists say the world needs to be well on the way to that goal over the next decade to avoid catastrophic climate crisis. Economists say a higher royalty rate would have a relatively small effect on global emissions, because any reductions in oil and gas from federal lands would be largely offset by fuel from other sources.",News/US news,Public lands to reopen for oil and gas drilling in a first under Biden,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/16/public-lands-reopen-oil-gas-drilling-joe-biden-government
4/17/2022,"In a simple sport usually contested head-to-head with two individuals involved, the nuances of team tennis competitions so often lend themselves to unpredictability and chaos. Such drama unfolded freely on a cold afternoon here as Great Britain fought admirably to push the Czech Republic all the way to an unlikely deciding fifth rubber in the Billie Jean King Cup qualifiers before finally losing 3-2. The second day opened with Marketa Vondrousova picking Emma Raducanu apart 6-1, 6-1 as the Briton struggled with foot blisters in the second half of the match. But the unproven 16-year-old Linda Fruhvirtova was chosen to face Harriet Dart, a shocking decision that Dart took full advantage of, closing out the victory 6-0, 5-7, 6-2. The home nation clinched the deciding doubles as Vondrousova and Karolina Muchova outclassed Dart and Katie Swan 6-1, 7-5. Despite Raducanu admirably grinding past Tereza Martincova in her first pro clay-court match, the sheer quality produced by Vondrousova this weekend, whose level was far above anyone else, was a true reality check to the demands of top-level clay court tennis for the US Open champion. Throughout their hour on court, Vondrousova soaked up Raducanu’s attempts to attack with her supreme defence, she pulled Raducanu off the court with angles and peppered her with delicate drop shots. After the first set, Raducanu took a medical timeout and she struggled to move until the end. She said the blisters began to affect her after her first match on Friday. “It was compromising every shot I had to play,” she said. “It’s very disappointing when you’re out there playing a rubber for your country and you feel completely redundant. But I can’t really do anything about it.” Blessed with an abundance of options despite missing four of their top five players, the Czech captain, Petr Pala, opted for the most dramatic choice possible by drafting in his fifth player, Fruhvirtova, ranked 170 in the world, for her Billy Jean King Cup debut rather than the three players in the top 80 ranked higher than Dart with far more clay-court experience. It turned out to be a truly horrendous decision. Dart entered the match determined to make up for her heavy loss to Vondrousova on Friday and as the higher-ranked player with far more experience, she imposed herself from the beginning against a tepid Fruhvirtova and played extremely well to lead 6-0, 3-0. Only Dart’s nerves allowed Fruhvirtova to be briefly competitive, but after squandering a 6-0, 5-2 lead and two match points, Dart recovered well to seal the victory in three sets. The tie came down to the doubles and despite dealing with cramp in the final set of her singles contest Dart quickly returned alongside Swan. It was, unsurprisingly, Vondrousova who took control and pulled the strings throughout the match alongside Muchova, who is returning from injury having reached the top 20 in singles last year. The British team were positive and resolute, recovering a late break and pushing deep into the second set, but the combined skill of two top-level players was too great and the Czechs confidently secured victory to move on.",Sport/Sport,Emma Raducanu gets reality check as Britain lose Billie Jean King Cup tie,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/16/emma-raducanu-gets-reality-check-as-britain-lose-billie-jean-king-cup-tie
4/17/2022,"It was difficult not to feel enormous sympathy for Watford’s long-suffering supporters at the final whistle here. Pontus Jansson’s late winner seconds after the home side had missed a golden opportunity at the other end to complete a memorable comeback not only leaves their Premier League status hanging by a slender thread but also created a most unwanted record. Not since Birmingham’s class of 1986 has a team in England’s top four divisions suffered 10 successive league defeats at home and Watford now trail Everton by six points and having played two games more. “It’s very hard to take,” said Roy Hodgson, who has yet to pick up a point after eight matches in charge at Vicarage Road. “We have to keep believing but who knows what can happen?” Incredibly, this was not the first time Watford had lost nine home league matches in a row, having been relegated to the old Division Three in 1971-72 the last time. Despite their struggles here, the club’s owners week reaffirmed their commitment to their home since August 1922 despite rumours that they had been considering a new 33,000-seat stadium on land at Bushey Hall golf club. Not since the 4-1 thrashing of Manchester United in November have supporters here seen a victory – an awful sequence that has left them staring down the trapdoor with six games to play. By contrast, Brentford’s Premier League status looked assured before this match and now seems certain after a third successive win. “It’s been a crazy and remarkable season for us,” said a delighted Thomas Frank, whose side are now 11th. “We have had three last-minute winners this season and that shows two things: that we are unbelievably fit and the character of my players.” Dennis’s previous goal this year had come in the victory at Aston Villa in February and the Nigeria forward was sprightly in the opening exchanges as Ismaïla Sarr wasted a golden opportunity to put Watford ahead from Kiko Femenía’s teasing cross. Not for the first time this season, however, their promising start was undone by a lapse in concentration in defence. A long throw in the 15th minute from Ethan Pinnock was flicked on at the near post by Kristoffer Ajer to leave the unmarked Christian Nørgaard to tap in. Pinnock’s match was over soon afterwards after he limped off clutching his hamstring. Watford spurned another chance when Dennis found space on the left but the header sailed harmlessly over the crossbar. A well-worked corner routine from Brentford saw Vitaly Janelt’s cross just elude Bryan Mbeumo at the near post before Christian Eriksen shot straight at Ben Foster from the edge of the area. If the home fans had hoped their opponents would already be on the beach then they were sadly mistaken. Several had already left in search of refreshments by the time Ajer’s sliced clearance just missed David Raya’s far post in the closest Watford had come to scoring in a miserable half, with those who remained making their displeasure known at the half-time whistle. Their mood will not have improved with the way Ivan Toney was allowed to stroll unmarked on to a sumptuous chipped free kick from Eriksen at the start of the second half. Luckily for Watford, Toney’s scuffed shot rolled harmlessly wide and within 60 seconds Watford were level. Moussa Sissoko’s cross from the right picked out Dennis at the far post and he smashed the ball past Raya, with VAR ruling Sarr had been marginally onside in the buildup when he flicked the ball on. Suddenly, Watford had renewed hope. A driving run down the left from Hassane Kamara set up Samir for an effort from outside the areathat whistled just wide of the post. Brentford were not prepared to roll over and they seemed more likely to find a winning goal until the dying moments when substitute Joshua King struck the post from a tight angle and Imran Louza somehow missed the rebound with the goal gaping. To make matters worse, Jansson then delivered the cruellest of blows from Eriksen’s free-kick with the final act.",Sport/Football,Jansson heads late winner for Brentford as Watford’s home woes continue,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/16/watford-brentford-premier-league-match-report
4/17/2022,"If Mikel Arteta was not already worried about his side’s dramatic dip in form, now he will surely be fretting about the prospect of Arsenal undoing all of their hard work as their pursuit of returning to the Champions League was dented by a damaging defeat at Southampton. Arteta had conceded that psychologically his team may have taken a hit in recent weeks and any hopes of regrouping were eroded as they succumbed to a fourth defeat in five Premier League matches, with the rejuvenated Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster keeping Arsenal at bay. The only redeeming aspect about another difficult afternoon is that one of their prime rivals for a top-four berth, Tottenham, also failed to take victory. For Southampton, this was something of a restorative mission, the kind of afternoon that cleansed the palette after five defeats in their previous six, including that Chelsea demolition. Forster was the only Southampton player to come out of their 6-0 battering at home to Chelsea with any credit and the goalkeeper, who was recalled to the England squad after a five-year hiatus last month, continued where he left off here, making a smart save low down to his right to repel an early curling shot by Gabriel Martinelli. Forster brilliantly denied the substitute Emile Smith Rowe in the second half and arguably the biggest moment arrived on 17 minutes when he shuffled across goal to somehow save Bukayo Saka’s attempt to convert Martinelli’s low cross. Eddie Nketiah, who led the line in the absence of the unwell Alexandre Lacazette, intercepted a loose pass by Yan Valery and fed Martinelli to his right, who delivered a cross from the right towards the back post. Saka should have scored but scooped his shot high, giving Forster the faintest chance to react. Arteta headed straight down the tunnel as soon as the half-time whistle sounded. Arsenal would have taken the lead through Saka but for a wondrous Forster save and instead they trailed at the interval to an unflattering goal. Arsenal conceded a corner after Armando Broja tried to glance a James Ward-Prowse free-kick goalwards on the edge of the box and after Aaron Ramsdale punched the subsequent Ward-Prowse delivery clear. But Romain Perraud managed to recycle possession, hooking a ball over his head more in hope than anything and Mohamed Elyounoussi darted towards the byline, where he cut the ball back for Jan Bednarek to calmly side-foot in beyond Ramsdale. Gabriel summed up Arsenal’s frustrations, walloping the ball against the crossbar as Southampton ran off to celebrate. Southampton, who had conceded 19 goals in their previous six matches, shifted to a five-man defence for this game, presumably to avoid anything remotely close to last week’s humbling and apart from Forster’s saves, Arsenal did not overly test a permeable back line. Mohammed Salisu, who is fasting as he observes Ramadan, was dropped to the bench in favour of Lyanco, who had a task on his hands to cage a game Nketiah and at one point he was powerless to prevent the striker galloping clear on halfway. Valery also displayed a vulnerability and was fortunate to avoid a booking for wiping out Nuno Tavares. On the opposite flank, the former Southampton defender Cedric Soares’s biggest first-half contribution were two wayward free-kicks. Arteta, all in black, clasped his hands together on the edge of his technical area as seagulls hovered overhead. Arsenal struggled to penetrate Southampton. Nketiah flicked at goal from a Soares cross approaching the hour mark but his shot dribbled towards Forster and then Martinelli volleyed over. A couple of minutes later Soares was withdrawn and replaced by Smith Rowe as Arteta shifted things around, with Granit Xhaka moving to left-back. Then came another chance, Saka flashing a bending shot wide of goal after chopping in from the right flank. Before the visiting supporters had the chance to digest the arrival of Nicolas Pépé from the substitutes bench with 20 minutes to play, suddenly this game turned into an exercise of attack versus defence, with every Arsenal player bar Ramsdale camped inside the Southampton half. Then, after a lull, Forster was called in action. Valery failed to clear a cross into the box and it dropped kindly for Smith Rowe. The Arsenal midfielder could only scuff a shot goalwards but it was tricky enough and was bobbling into the corner before Forster clawed the ball away. Martin Ødegaard and Xhaka went close late on but Southampton held on to eke out victory.",Sport/Football,Southampton hand Arsenal latest alarming loss after Jan Bednarek winner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/16/southampton-arsenal-premier-league-match-report
