3/7/2022,"The economic crime bill, or to give its formal title, the economic crime (transparency and enforcement) bill, is scheduled be rushed through the Commons on Monday. Here is what it is, and what it is meant to do. In broad terms, it is meant to make life more difficult for people seeking to hide wealth in the UK, particularly those doing so from overseas, including criminals and those such as Russian oligarchs who might be seeking to shelter illicitly-acquired money, particularly through property purchases. The bill had been repeatedly delayed, and after ministers were unable to guarantee it would even appear in this session of parliament, there was recent speculation it might have been dropped. But following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the focus on Russian money in the UK, it was tabled last week, and the plan is for all its Commons stages to take place on Monday. It is to set up a so-called register of overseas entities, which would be a list of the ultimate owners of property or land in the UK purchased by overseas individuals or companies. Currently, many expensive properties, especially in London, are owned by opaque shell companies based overseas. The register, to be updated annually would oblige a company to declare who the “beneficial owner” is, meaning the person who ultimately owns or controls an asset. Failure to properly register such details will be a criminal offence, with a potential punishment of up to five years’ jail. While this is a change that opposition parties and campaigners have long pushed for, there are concerns about some elements. One worry is that existing owners will have up to six months to register, potentially allowing people to dispose of or transfer illicit assets. The bill puts this grace period at an even higher 18 months, but following pressure from Labour and others, a government amendment will reduce it to six. Labour has called for it to be 28 days. There are also concerns that some owners could claim exemptions, and that there is a parallel need for better UK companies records. It is also toughening up the regime for so-called unexplained wealth orders, which can oblige people suspected of acquiring wealth through criminal or illicit means to explain how they did so. Changes include expanding the range of people who can be subject to an order, to cover company directors, and to increase the grounds under which an order can be granted. While the orders can be effective, only four have been imposed since they were introduced in 2018, and none since Boris Johnson become prime minister. Further provisions in the bill will make it easier for ministers to sanction individuals, for example removing the requirement that those targeted must have known or suspected they breached sanctions law. Ministers have faced criticism for the fact that the UK has so far sanctioned many fewer people accused of connections to Russia and Vladimir Putin than have the US and EU. There has been a parallel plan to toughen rules by which companies are registered at Companies House, and Labour had called for some of these, such as identity checks for directors, to be included in the economic crime bill. This is not going to happen, although the government has pledged to push ahead with its separate proposals on company records. While the bill, overall, is expected to get widespread support from opposition parties, Labour have tabled an amendment which would reduce the grace period for retrospective property registration to be cut to 28 days. The Liberal Democrats are expected to support both the government amendment on six months, and the Labour one.",News/Business,What is the economic crime bill and how effective will it be?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/07/what-is-the-economic-bill-and-how-effective-will-it-be
3/7/2022,"As the conflict in Ukraine escalates, expert cyber-watchers have been speculating about the kind of cyber-attacks that Russia might conduct. Will the Kremlin turn off Ukraine’s power grid, dismantle Ukraine’s transport system, cut off the water supply or target the health system? Or would cybercriminals operating from Russia, who could act as proxies for the Russian regime, conduct these activities? Over the past decade, Ukraine has experienced many major cyber-attacks, most of which have been attributed to Russia. From election interference in 2014, which compromised the central electoral system and jeopardised the integrity of the democratic process; to a hack and blackout attack in a first-of-its-kind fully remote cyber-attack on a power grid in 2015, resulting in countrywide power outages; to one of the costliest malicious software attacks, NotPetya, in 2017, which significantly disrupted access to banking and government services in Ukraine and, subsequently, spilled over to France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, the UK, the US and Australia. On the eve of 13 January, as troops were amassing along the Ukrainian border, about 70 Ukrainian government websites were taken down due to “unauthorised interference”, dubbed WhisperGate. The following day, these websites were defaced with a political threat that Ukrainian data had been leaked and with a warning to “be afraid and expect the worst”. The attacks did not stop there. Almost a month later, further denial of service attacks took down government websites and state-owned banking services. The UK, US and Australia were quick to publicly attribute the attacks to Russia, and name and shame the military intelligence arm of the Russian armed forces (GRU) as responsible for the attacks. In response to the Russian threat, there have been unprecedented efforts by private and government entities – and even individuals – to support Ukraine’s cyber resilience. Responding to cyber-attacks and building national cyber resilience has never been – and will never be – the sole responsibility of governments. It requires a whole-of-society approach grounded in international cooperation efforts. For the first time since its inception, the EU rapid cyber response team, with capabilities to detect and respond to a variety of threats, and headed by Lithuania, was deployed to help defend against cyber-attacks targeting Ukraine. The Romanian national cybersecurity agency and a cybersecurity company called Bitdefender launched a public-private partnership to provide pro bono technical support and threat intelligence to Ukraine’s government, businesses and citizens for “as long as it is necessary”. Nato, which has been working for a number of years with Ukraine to increase its cyber defences, signed an agreement a few weeks before the invasion aimed at enhancing cyber cooperation with Ukraine. The tech community leveraged its resources and knowledge to expose cyber-attacks and threats, and limit their spread. Shortly after WhisperGate, Microsoft shared technical analysis on the tools and techniques used in the attack and recommendations for those affected, and it continues to do so. The Slovakia-based cybersecurity firm ESET exposed the nefarious component of the HermeticWiper malware attacks in February, a malware designed with a component aimed at “wiping” the data out of systems. This timely technical analysis provided vital information to security experts and governments about the technical steps that should be put in place to mitigate and protect against hacks. At the same time, efforts within Ukraine started to materialise. In what has been referred to as an unprecedented effort in the midst of an armed conflict, a whole “IT army” of volunteers was assembled in response to a request by the minister of digital transformation to support the country’s cyber-defence efforts, with reports of some even operating from within bomb shelters. The solidarity shown so far is unprecedented and a testament to the benefits and potential of collective action across sectors and communities. As the war continues, this solidarity will become even more important. Joyce Hakmeh is a senior research fellow for the International Security Programme at Chatham House.

3/7/2022,"The biggest week of the year for betting turnover on racing is almost upon us and here come the ads full of pumped-up punters, projecting the image of gambling that the bookies want you to see: bonuses, free bets, a giddy four-day ride of fun and frolics in the west country with a rousing chorus of Sweet Caroline to round it all off. And for thousands of their customers in Cheltenham week at least, the reality may not be too far off the mark. If, however, you turn out to be one of those whose experience of betting with the UK’s regulated gambling industry is altogether different, here is a website you might be glad you bookmarked. For the last six years, a small group of volunteers at Justice For Punters has been offering free advice to punters in dispute with gambling firms, steadily building on their experience from hundreds of individual cases and, in the process, extracting £2.6m from operators that they had initially refused to pay out. On Monday, its site and operation relaunched in a new guise, and while it no longer accepts individual inquiries, its aim is that in future, it will do all it can to ensure that punters can help themselves. J4P was founded by Brian Chappell, who worked tirelessly on issues around fair and transparent treatment for punters alongside another veteran campaigner, Paul Fairhead, until the latter’s sudden death 18 months ago. Both had wide experience of life at the sharp end of gambling, and in particular, of how individual companies can use vague and unfair Terms & Conditions – which customers agree to on sign-up via a tick-box – to avoid paying out on bets, confiscate balances and other dubious practices. Chappell decided in November that the workload involved with J4P was becoming unmanageable, and has spent the last four months putting together a number of detailed “self-help” guides for punters who want to pursue a claim against a bookie. Options are set out clearly and plainly, with an honest assessment of pros and cons. In addition to disputes over bets, another guide considers the possibility of forcing firms to refund vulnerable punters who may have been exploited, for instance via a “VIP” scheme which offers free tickets to big events and other gifts to high-stakes players, so long as they continue betting. Again, there are no promises of success, and an extensive, highly personal account of one punter’s journey into the depths of despair due to gambling addiction pulls no punches at all. “The workload became much more challenging with the sad, unexpected death of Paul Fairhead 18 months ago,” Chappell says. “I’ve missed him immensely. After six years, hundreds of cases, thousands of hours, £2.6m returned, it’s time for J4P to provide self-help guides for punters, because J4P can’t go on doing the same amount of voluntary work forever. We hope they are useful.” Southwell 1.00 Len Brennan 1.35 Massini Man 2.10 Activial 2.45 Geometrical 3.20 Kyntara 3.55 Hazard Collonges 4.30 Tarseem  Wetherby 1.45 Our Bill’s Aunt 2.20 Broomfields Kan 2.55 Cartonne 3.30 Jante Law 4.05 Indian Brave 4.40 Motown Lake 5.10 Grey Dawning  Wolverhampton5.30 Caribbean Sunset (nb) 6.00 Obtain 6.30 Red Showgirl 7.00 Nellie French 7.30 Raabeh 8.00 Clap Your Hands (nap) 8.30 Seagulls Nest  The new material on J4P’s also moves beyond dispute resolution to include articles that every punter should read. A piece headed “Making an informed choice to gamble” details the day-to-day realities of customer-tracking, bet restrictions and dubious T&Cs that the operators would prefer to keep under wraps. With publication of the government’s white paper on reform to the gambling laws now imminent, there is much here for all sides to consider as a new regulatory regime for UK gambling takes shape. Chappell has been hands-on with the reality of how the current system of regulation operates for years, and remains deeply sceptical about what the next Gambling Act is likely to achieve for punters. “After six years helping punters obtain £2.6m they were owed, J4P’s volunteers have become disillusioned with regulators and others who are close to the gambling industry,” Chappell says. “Very few seem interested in transparency, which is crucial to fulfilling the main objectives of UK gambling regulation, by being as fair and safe as possible and keeping crime out of gambling. We do hope the new self-help guides really help people to continue fighting for justice as J4P steps back.”",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Justice For Punters gets timely reboot before Cheltenham,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/07/talking-horses-justice4punters-gets-timely-reboot-before-cheltenham-festival-horse-racing-tips
3/7/2022,"Roman Stepanovych is no stranger to war. In an award-winning career for English-language news outlets including the Associated Press and Vice News, the 32-year-old Ukrainian journalist has reported from Syria, Chechnya and Myanmar, as well as covering the conflict closer to home in the Donbas region. In the 12 days since Russia invaded, however, he has been dealing with an entirely new reality. It is not just his own safety on the line anymore: his children, parents, friends and Zaborona, the independent news website he and his wife founded in 2017, are at risk too. “I’m from Donetsk, which is occupied by separatists, and my wife [Kateryna Sergatskova, Zaborona’s editor-in-chief] and I and have worked in dangerous places. She was in Iraq. But now I think it was just an introduction for this. It is completely different when it is your home,” he said. Zaborona is one of dozens of small news outlets focusing on investigative journalism that sprang up in Ukraine in the aftermath of the 2013 Maidan revolution. The protests eventually led to the overthrow of Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Russian president accused of extensive corruption, political intimidation and abuse of those who demonstrated against his government. Despite the conflict in Donbas and Crimea, in many respects Ukrainian civil society and democratic initiatives have since flourished. Even so, the government has struggled to stamp out endemic corruption. Zaborona, which has investigated the 2016 murder of journalist Pavel Sheremet and taboo topics such as LGBTQ rights and church abuses, covers the kind of stories that Ukraine’s traditional media outlets have neither the ability nor inclination to touch. For the 31-strong newsroom, however, the focus now is purely on surviving – both literally and figuratively. One Ukrainian journalist has already been killed, and another four injured. A Sky News crew was evacuated back to the UK from Ukraine on Sunday after the journalists were shot during an ambush by Russian snipers. As Stepanovych knows well from his time working in Russia, Moscow has limited – and declining – tolerance for journalism which doesn’t conform to the Kremlin’s preferred narratives. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Russia is now a more dangerous place for media workers than any time since the end of the cold war; murders and physical attacks often go unpunished, while new laws aim to stifle the free press and internet. The repression has become almost total since Moscow invaded Ukraine. Last week the Russian government shut down the country’s last independent TV channel, TV Rain, as well as Echo of Moscow, one of its oldest radio stations. The BBC and other international news organisations have been blocked, as well as Facebook and Twitter, for allegedly spreading false information about the war. Most of the journalism outlets remaining in Russia have suspended operations following a law passed on Friday punishing “fake war reports” with up to 15 years in prison. The 2021 co-winner of the Nobel peace prize Dmitry Muratov, editor-in-chief of the independent Novaya Gazeta, told the New Yorker before the legislation was passed: “For now, we continue to call war war. We are waiting for the consequences.” The newspaper has since deleted content from its website. In February, the US government reportedly sent a letter to the UN warning that there is “credible information that indicates Russian forces are creating lists of identified Ukrainians to be killed or sent to camps following a military occupation”. The Zaborona team is sure that is the case. But for now, they are focusing on what can be done: setting up a new newsroom in Lviv, a city near the Polish border; coordinating stories, photographs and video footage from reporters dotted around the country; and raising money through the newly created 24.02 Foundation. The fundraiser will buy bulletproof vests and helmets, medical equipment and satellite phones, and otherwise go towards logistical needs such as petrol and generators, as the Zaborona reporters make a sudden transformation into full-time war correspondents. Many other Ukrainian news outlets are doing the same. The CEO of the Kyiv Independent has started a GoFundMe page to “Keep Ukraine’s media going”, the proceeds of which will go to a growing list of news organisations, with support “allocated based on urgency of needs in the first place, then distributed proportionally”. “Before we would have been competitors, but we are not any more,” Stepanovych said. “If someone is in the right place and we need to write something or check something it doesn’t matter who they work for, we can call, because we are all working together collectively.” It is not clear what the future holds. Men aged between 18 – 60 are not allowed to leave Ukraine, and may be called up to fight, even if they have no military experience. Sixty per cent of Zaborona’s newsroom is female: some have already left, taking their children with them, to set up in other countries and reach funders for help. But the newsroom still has hope. “It is hard to undo the gains we have made since Maidan,” Stepanovych said. “We will keep going. Maybe we will be fighting and writing at the same time. But we will be here until the end.”",News/World news,‘We will be here until the end’: the fight to keep Ukraine’s news media alive,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/we-will-be-here-until-the-end-the-fight-to-keep-ukraine-news-media-alive-russia
3/7/2022,"Concerns are growing across the Middle East and north Africa that the war in Ukraine will send prices of staple foods soaring as wheat supplies are hit, potentially fuelling unrest. Russia and Ukraine supply a quarter of the world’s wheat exports, while Egypt is the world’s biggest importer of wheat. In Tunisia, like many people queueing for bread in Tunis’s sprawling medina, or old town, Khmaes Ammani, a day labourer, said the rising cost of living was leaving him squeezed. “There’s never any money at the end of the month,” he said. “I even have to borrow some. Everything is getting more expensive.” Nearly half of Tunisia’s wheat imports come from Ukraine, and the Russian invasion has sent prices to a 14-year high. Even though the Tunisian state controls the price of bread, people fear they will inevitably feel the crunch. “If the price of bread goes up, it’ll mean cutbacks elsewhere,” said Ammani. “We need the bread.” Tunisia is highly vulnerable to such aftershocks, with a fragile economy battered in recent years by inflation and high unemployment, and saddled with large amounts of public debt. But it is far from the only country in the Middle East and north Africa that would face difficulties in the event of prolonged supply-chain disruption and price hikes. Yemen, which has itself has been ravaged by war since 2014, imports almost all its wheat, with more than a third coming from Russia and Ukraine. It is highly dependent on bread, which is thought to make up over half of the calorie intake for the average household. Lebanon, a country in the grips of economic crisis with inflation at a record high, usually imports more than half of its wheat from Ukraine. Last Friday, the economy and trade minister, Amin Salam, was reported as saying the country had enough wheat for “a month, or a month and a half”. The government was talking to other suppliers, he added, including the US, “who have expressed their willingness to help if we needed to import large quantities of wheat”. Abeer Etefa, a World Food Programme spokesperson based in Cairo, said many of the commodities already affected by the Russian invasion were “of particular importance” to the Middle East and north Africa. But sourcing grain from other exporters was not easy, she warned. “There is a surplus in the global production of wheat this year, but if you look at where the wheat will be coming from, it means a longer lead time and higher transportation costs [than from Ukraine],” she said. In Egypt, where flatbread is a staple food, much of the wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine. Even before the invasion, with prices having risen by 80% between April 2020 and December 2021, the government said it planned to raise the cost of heavily subsidised bread for the first time in decades after President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi said: “I cannot provide 20 loaves of bread at the cost of one cigarette.” The Egyptian prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, said the government would “ensure that the neediest people are not harmed”, but gave no more details. In Lebanon, which also subsidises bread, Salam warned that the central bank would not be able to keep pace if prices continued to rise. In a region with a long history of political and social unrest provoked by worsening economic conditions, particularly unaffordable food prices, the risks are clear. Etefa said the global outlook was worrying. “War leads to greater food insecurity, and food insecurity increases the chance of unrest and violence,” she said. “So a conflict in Ukraine leading to hunger and pushing people into food insecurity elsewhere could have [the] potential for unrest and violence in other areas. And really, the world cannot afford another conflict.” Rama Hansraj, Save the Children’s director in Yemen, warned of a global “ripple effect” that could unleash “additional horrors” in other vulnerable countries. “In Yemen, 8 million children are already on the brink of famine. Families are exhausted. They’ve faced horror after horror through seven years of war. We fear they will not be able to endure another shock, especially to the main ingredient keeping their children alive,” she said. Tunisia’s government remains tightlipped on the flour shortages, even though the evidence is already apparent. Across the country, bakeries are shutting early, or rationing supplies, with anger growing among owners. “There’s been a problem building for months,” said Hazem Bouanani, a baker. “Normally, we buy flour from mills and the government will reimburse us. For 10 months, we haven’t seen any payment.” Habib Awaida, at the 80-year-old Sabbat bakery, was stoic, declaring that “even if we can’t find bread, we’ll eat something else.” He added, however, that it was up to the government to reduce Tunisia’s reliance on imports. “We should really think about investing in our own wheat,” he said.

3/7/2022,"Over the past decade or so, the Eurovision Song Contest has outgrown its naff, ironic reputation and become such a celebratory juggernaut that imitators were bound to come along at some point. And this month, the biggest imitator of all will be unleashed upon the world. That’s right, make way for the American Song Contest. Starting in two weeks, the American Song Contest will see performers from all 50 US states, plus five US territories and Washington DC gather together to sing original material and compete for a prize that will ultimately be awarded in May. However, unlike the first Eurovision – held in 1956 and so sparsely entered that each country had to sing two songs – the American Song Contest wants to begin with a bang. So long as you’re able to retain some perspective (after all, nobody at the pinnacle of their career is going to take a gamble on a televised singing competition) its list of acts is breathtakingly starry. The show itself will be hosted by Snoop Dogg and Kelly Clarkson, and the line-up includes plenty of acts who already have their own Wikipedia page. Jewell is representing Alaska. Sisqó is representing Maryland. Macy Gray is representing Ohio. Michael Bolton is representing Connecticut. That performers of this pedigree are willing to drop everything for the American Song Contest is no surprise – Michael Bolton was most recently employed to sing ironic easy listening cover versions on a dating show – but it is a sign that organisers are taking this thing seriously. Of course, the fact that you know these peoples’ names doesn’t guarantee any sort of success. The UK spent years throwing big time celebrities at Eurovision, and all this did was reinforce the notion that name recognition is not the magic key you might think. Blue tried and failed to win once, as did Bonnie Tyler and Englebert Humperdink. And every year they were beaten by a less famous performer who arrived at the contest armed with a much better song.This, after all, is what the contests – both European and American – are about. It doesn’t matter who you are, or how many records you’ve sold. Turn up with an undeniable song and you’re going to win. The bigger question is whether or not the American Song Contest will be a match for Eurovision. My gut feeling is that it won’t. In terms of culture, Europe is all over the place, and what makes Eurovision so special is that it allows all these diverse tastes and languages and attitudes to collide. To watch Eurovision is to submerge yourself in a complex web of warped allegiances, political voting and localised cultural touchpoints that often don’t translate quite as well as the performer would like. But with a single country literally made of lots of united states, we can probably expect to see a lot less sociological diversity. That might not happen, of course. Like Eurovision, the American Song Contest could redraw the lines of geographical rivalries in a way that rips the scabs off several old wounds. If it does, it might even help to explain America to the world, which will be no bad thing. In fact, you could argue that this is exactly the right time to unleash the American Contest on the world. After all, Eurovision was originally designed to help a scarred continent forge a new sense of post-war harmony, by demonstrating that our neighbours aren’t as far from us as we might have thought. It was explicitly a method of pulling us all back together. And if it takes Michael Bolton honking out some old rubbish on the television to achieve the same thing for America, the whole thing will be money well spent.",Arts/Television & radio,‘Breathtakingly starry’: is the American Song Contest about to outdo Eurovision?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/07/breathtakingly-starry-is-the-american-song-contest-about-to-outdo-eurovision
