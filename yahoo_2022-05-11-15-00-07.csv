5/11/2022,"KYIV — Dmytro Kuleba casually looked up to the sky through a cloud of his own cigar smoke as the air raid sirens went off across the capital. “This just demonstrates the depths of all of their hatred towards us,” he said, puffing on his Italian Toscano in the courtyard of the Foreign Ministry as armed guards circled. The babyfaced Kuleba, who at 41 is Ukraine’s youngest-ever foreign minister, has been in office for just over two years. But he quickly earned the trust of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and notoriety among counterparts for the diplomacy and coordination he’s crafted in Europe and with America. “Actually, we are winning. We won the battle for Kyiv,” Kuleba said, evincing less elation than a lingering frustration. “We are not as dumb as you might think, and our army proved that they’re pretty efficient.” With that efficiency, he added, “we finally won the trust of the United States.” But Kuleba let it be clear that he believes if the United States and other Western allies had only trusted Kyiv more — and provided the weapons Kyiv requested in the months prior to Russia’s late February invasion — thousands of lives may have been saved. “Our partners were reluctant,” Kuleba said. He was repeatedly told by his Western counterparts before Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale assault on his country that it would take weeks, if not months, to train the Ukrainians on many of the more advanced weapons they asked for, such as air-defense systems. A senior administration official pushed back on Kuleba’s comments, noting that well before the Russian invasion, the United States provided “as much assistance as possible that they could put to immediate use.” The official noted Ukrainian officials themselves were asking the U.S. government to call specific countries to find Soviet-style weapons “because it’s what they knew how to use.” “The secretary worked the phones nonstop in response to the shopping list that our Ukrainian partners put forward,” the official said. The United States did provide Ukraine the Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles it needed early on to win the battle of Kyiv, the official stressed. But Kuleba sees it differently. Allies weren’t convinced that Ukrainian forces would last more than a couple weeks against Russia’s much larger military, he said. He recalled a conversation he had in the first days of the war with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. “I asked him that maybe it’s finally time to give Ukraine Patriots [surface-to-air missile systems], because, you know, it had been on the agenda for months,” he said. “And he said, ‘Dmytro, in principle, I mean, this, it could happen. But you should take into account that it will take at least two or three months to train your people for how to use them.’” The senior administration official said Blinken said it would take “up to a year,” not two or three months, to train Ukrainian soldiers on the Patriot. As an alternative, the U.S. helped coordinate the transfer of the Russian S-300 missile system from other countries, the official said. At that time, Kuleba admitted, neither he nor Blinken could envisage that the war would drag on for as long as it has. “But if we had been heard from the very beginning on all the weapons that we need to receive, if we didn’t have to spend hours and days explaining to partners in Europe and in the United States why we need specifically this weapon and not another one, we would have received all these weapons by now,” Kuleba said. “We would have trained all the people and the situation on the ground would have been much different, would have been much better.” “This is where all of us lost time and allowed Putin to gain what he shouldn’t have,” he added. In a statement to POLITICO, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby defended the American assistance to Ukraine, noting that it was “not predicated on any indications of Ukraine’s ability or willingness to resist Russia’s invasion.” “Instead, assistance was determined based on an assessment of Ukrainian near-term requirements, including through close consultation with the Government of Ukraine,” Kirby said. The United States has committed a total of $4.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, and surged aid “within days” after Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion, Kirby said. The assistance was designed to meet Ukraine’s “most critical requirements at the time as conveyed by the Government of Ukraine,” he added. Kuleba might argue with that timeline. Yet even with the limited weapons at their disposal, the Ukrainian army and territorial defense forces still managed to push Russian troops back from around the capital region, as well as Chernihiv and Sumy in the north, forcing Putin to recalculate and refocus his ground operation in the south and east of Ukraine. The Pentagon said Monday that it does not consider the fighting in the east as a “stalemate” since Russia is still making progress there. But strong Ukrainian resistance has kept Russian forces from quickly advancing further into Ukrainian territory. The Pentagon now assesses Russia is two weeks or more behind its objectives in the Donbas, and is still struggling with logistics and morale issues, a senior DoD official said Tuesday. Some Western officials are now acknowledging their mistake. “Ukraine would have done better if they had the weapons on hand earlier. They would have been able to train with weapons and properly embed them in their formations much easier,” a U.S. defense official told POLITICO. Still, hindsight is 20-20. As recently as early February, there was still debate over whether Russia would invade and to what extent, the official said. With that newfound trust has come greater assistance from allies. In recent weeks, the U.S. and many EU countries have dedicated billions of dollars more in military aid, deepening their commitment to Ukraine and its defense. Congress is looking to pass a $40 billion package to bolster Ukraine’s armed forces and provide humanitarian aid, an increase of $7 billion from President Joe Biden’s funding request. On Monday, Biden signed into law a lend-lease act, making it easier to send weapons to the country. Kuleba said “the turning point” that convinced the West to step up support came in large part due to Ukraine’s military gains. “People like success stories and we have a success story in surviving for much longer than anyone could expect,” he said. But that early success also came with the realization that if the West wants Kyiv to win the war outright, it needs to provide the Ukrainians with modern weaponry. Despite early shipments of anti-tank Javelins and anti-aircraft Stinger shoulder-fired missiles, the U.S. spent weeks looking at old Soviet stockpiles around the world to see what they could send to Ukraine, Kuleba said. “And then they finally came to the conclusion that these [stockpiles are] almost empty,” he said. “Ukraine will literally run out of weapons and ammunition shortly. So the whole logic had to be changed from ‘Let's give them everything that you have in your warehouses [from] Soviet times’ to ‘We have to start the transition of Ukraine to Western weapons.’” The turning point, said Kuleba, was two months after the start of the war — on April 26, when U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Mark Milley met with the Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov and other officials at Germany’s Ramstein Air Base. At Ramstein, he said, the U.S. convinced European allies to “transition Ukraine from Soviet to NATO weapons.” In recent days, new U.S. weaponry has poured in, including 89 of 90 towed M777 howitzers and additional Switchblade drones; more than 20 of 121 promised Phoenix Ghost drones have also arrived in the country. Western countries are also stepping up training efforts: As of Monday, more than 310 Ukrainian soldiers have completed howitzer training, and another 50 or more are going through another course. Kuleba said Ukraine has also convinced Washington to step up intelligence sharing, which has led to several battlefield victories, although the minister was careful not to say these included the sinking of warships or artillery strikes that killed Russian generals, as has been reported. “I did receive a comment, a couple of compliments from foreign partners for the sinking of the Moskva cruiser, the flagship of the Black Sea fleet,” he said, brandishing his cigar. With the air raid sirens screaming as if to underline the continued threat, Kuleba said that Russia’s military operation is “clearly aimed at total destruction of our country and of our nation.” He pointed to recent missile strikes on critical infrastructure across the country, including fuel depots and food storage, as well as the blockade of Ukrainian ports. Kuleba noted the atrocities carried out by Russian troops in the Kyiv region, where bodies lined the streets and buildings were pounded with heavy artillery. Russia’s lack of care regarding the bodies of its own soldiers also illustrates that Russians and Ukrainians are not one and the same, he said. “To anyone who still argues that Ukrainians and Russians are brothers: We are not only not brothers, we are not even similar,” he said. “The difference between us and them is that for us, human life is everything.” Kuleba said the goals of the war have now shifted — what Russia has done to his country has changed how Ukraine thinks about victory. If at the start of the invasion a Ukrainian win looked like keeping Russian forces from gaining any more territory than they have controlled for the past eight years, now Kyiv will settle for nothing less than full control over all Ukrainian land. “The end story for Ukraine is, of course, the liberation of occupied territories. And payments by Russia for everything … for all the damage that [has been] inflicted on us,” he said. But that doesn’t necessarily mean a total military victory. “Every war ends with diplomacy,” Kuleba said. “The question is, when the moment of diplomacy has come, are you in a position to fix the end of the war on your terms? Is your adversary capable of fixing it on his terms? Or you will get an agreement that no one likes, that meets no one’s interests, and that postpones the war further, as happened with Minsk agreements, for example.” The Minsk agreements were signed in September 2014 and February 2015, as Russian forces and their local proxies in eastern Ukraine captured large swathes of land in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Kyiv was in a weak negotiating position then, and its president at the time, Petro Poroshenko, was forced to sign deals that were seen as being more favorable to Moscow in order to stop the bloodshed. But those deals ultimately didn’t end the war. Rather, they froze the frontline and transformed the fight into one of attrition. Until Feb. 24. “Enough of Minsk,” Kuleba said. Ukraine’s goal and his job now, he said, “as a wartime foreign minister,” is to make sure Kyiv is in the strongest position possible when it comes time to negotiate an end to the war. That means working “to get Ukraine as many weapons as we need, to make sure that the world imposes as many sanctions as possible and they are as tough as possible on Russia.” Lara Seligman reported from Washington, D.C.",World/Politico,‘We are not as dumb as you might think’: Ukraine’s foreign minister rues U.S. delay in providing weapons,https://news.yahoo.com/not-dumb-might-think-ukraine-214546070.html

The taxiing flight returned to the gate before takeoff and was delayed for several hours. Nine Israeli citizens were arrested Tuesday at Tel Aviv's Ben Guiron airport on suspicion of making a terrorist threat after passengers aboard a flight to Turkey received graphic photos of plane crashes on their phones shortly before takeoff. ""The nine ... are suspected of broadcasting images of an air disaster on the plane, causing panic and delaying the plane's departure by several hours,"" the Israel Airports Authority said in a statement, adding that sending the photos could be seen as a ""terrorist threat,"" The Guardian reported. Though no one was injured and the flight resumed after a security search, ""One woman fainted, another had a panic attack,"" a passenger identified only as Diana told Israel's Channel 12, the Jersalem Post reported. Among the photos, The Times of Israel reported, were scenes from the crash of Asiana Airlines flight 214. The passenger flight crashed during on final approach near Seoul, South Korea, in 2013, killing three people. The suspects may be prosecuted for disseminating false information, according to the Jersalem Post. The offense carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison.

And, once it reached its final destination, the team began aligning all of its instruments. Over the past few months, we’ve seen some updates to that alignment process. Now, though, NASA has released new images showing off the full potential photo quality possible with James Webb. And, it’s pretty insane. In a blog post, as well as a tweet, NASA compares images captured by the James Webb’s MIRI instrument and the much older Spitzer Space telescope’s IRAC camera. The difference between the two images is immense. On the one hand, we already knew that the James Webb’s photo quality was going to be unlike anything we’ve ever had access to. Pair the overall quality with the location where it has been set up, and Webb is in a good spot. The new space telescope should be an instrumental tool in helping us learn more about the early universe when it begins operations later this year. One of the most exciting things about the James Webb’s photo quality being as high as it is is the amount of detail we’ll be capable of capturing now. Previously, capturing details of far-flung galaxies has been difficult. Sure, we’ve seen some great images from Hubble and other space instruments. But Webb will bring even more possibilities to the table. This overall quality, and the strength of the instruments aboard, is part of why Webb is so highly regarded in the space community right now. With so many plans moving forward to put man back on the Moon, as well as to find ways to make Mars habitable, it is paramount that we understand more about our universe. This place that we call home is so much larger than we are. With the ability to capture sure high-resolution photographs, and the quality that James Webb offers, we can finally turn those far-flung discoveries into images that are easier to showcase to young astronomers. The younger generation will continue to play a pivotal role in our expeditions away from the Earth. Especially as humanity slowly works its way towards living among the stars. And, with any luck, it could even help us pinpoint signs of alien life in distant galaxies. James Webb’s photo quality could also help us learn more about the mysteries of black holes. Ultimately, this new space telescope is a step forward in our fight to learn more about the universe. It will help us dive deeper into how it came to be. And, ultimately, it will help us learn more about the different components that make it up. Click here to read the full article.

5/11/2022,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday slammed the United States for changing the wording on the State Department website about Taiwan, saying ""political manipulation"" will not succeed in changing the status quo over the island. The State Department website's section on relations with Taiwan has removed wording on not supporting Taiwan independence and on acknowledging Beijing's position that Taiwan is part of China. Washington said the update did not reflect a change in policy. China's government considers the democratically ruled island to be inviolable Chinese territory. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters there is only one China, Taiwan belongs to China and that the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole country. Taiwan rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's 23 million people can decide their future. The United States' changing of its fact sheet on Taiwan-U.S ties is ""a petty act of fictionalising and hollowing out the one-China principle,"" he added. ""This kind of political manipulation on the Taiwan question is an attempt to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, and will inevitably stir up a fire that only burns"" the United States, Zhao said. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that while some wording may have changed, ""our underlying policy has not changed."" ""We regularly do updates on our fact sheets. Our fact sheets reflect, in the case of Taiwan, our rock-solid unofficial relationship with Taiwan, and we call upon the PRC to behave responsibly and to not manufacture pretences to increase pressure on Taiwan,"" Price said in a press briefing, referring to the People's Republic of China. The wording change appears to have happened on May 5, the date at the top of the fact sheet, but it was only widely noticed in Chinese and Taiwanese media on Tuesday. The State Department also added wording on the Six Assurances, referring to six Reagan-era security assurances given to Taiwan, which the United States declassified in 2020. U.S. President Joe Biden said in November the United States was not encouraging independence for Taiwan, having caused a stir in October when he said it would come to the island's defence if China attacked. The latter remark appeared to depart from Washington's long-held policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" - not making clear how the United States would respond - though the White House quickly said Biden was not signalling a change in policy. U.S. intelligence chiefs told a congressional hearing on Tuesday that China would prefer to take over Taiwan without military action but was working to get to a position where its military could prevail even if the United States intervenes. Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said the island will continue to strengthen its defence capabilities and cooperate with the United States and other like-minded countries to promote peace, stability and prosperity.
