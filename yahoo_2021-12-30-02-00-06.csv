12/30/2021,"The Capitol riot committee agreed to a request not to seek hundreds of Trump-era documents. The Biden administration was concerned that releasing the documents would harm national security. Trump so far failed to get a total block on such releases, but this means some will stay concealed. The Capitol riot committee agreed to pause efforts to obtain sensitive Trump-era White House documents after the Biden administration said their release could compromise national security. White House Deputy Counsel Jonathan Su wrote in a newly-published letter that the committee had agreed to defer their attempts to secure documents from the Trump White House as they investigate the events of January 6, when hundreds of protestors stormed the Capitol building. ""The Select Committee has agreed to withdraw or defer its request for the documents,"" Su wrote in the letter. It was dated December 16, but was not made public until it was reported by the Associated Press on Tuesday. The deferral came after concerns from the Biden White House over the committee's attempts to obtain documents that could provide information about former President Donald Trump's actions on January 6. The committee is weighing whether to ask the Department of Justice to criminally prosecute Trump for obstructing Congress in relation to the Capitol riot. Su said in the letter that the Capitol riot committee had agreed specifically to defer its request for ""internal White House documents that collect and summarize agency intelligence reports and related items."" Trump is seeking legally to block the release of all documents from his administration. He has claimed that the executive privilege he had at the time the records were made means he can continue to block their release. A federal appeals court rejected the argument in September and said executive privilege should not be used to ""withhold information that reflects a clear and apparent effort to subvert the Constitution itself."" The case is now headed to the Supreme Court. The Capitol riot committee also agreed to defer its request for some documents relating to the National Security Council. Su said Biden recognized that Congress was required to ""understand the circumstances that led to the insurrection."" But, he argued, the documents they committee wanted were not relevant. ""The documents for which the Select Committee has agreed to withdraw its request do not appear to bear on the White House's preparations for or response to the events of January 6,"" he wrote.

12/30/2021,"Model and actor Paing Takhon was sentenced to three years in jail for speaking out during protests in Myanmar, in the same week he was named the “Most Handsome Face” of 2021 by entertainment site TC Candler.

Takhon was named the world’s “Most Handsome Face” of 2021, coinciding with the model and actor’s sentencing this week for his support of the anti-coup protests in Myanmar earlier this year. He was arrested in April, following his public support of protestors on social media.
 
Takhon rose to global prominence at the beginning of 2021 when he became known as the “hot monk” through viral social media posts. At the time, he had already appeared in various movies and a TV series in Myanmar.

His popularity was noticed by TC Candler, who named him the “Most Handsome Face” of 2021, alongside the “Most Beautiful Face” Lisa from the K-pop group Blackpink. The outlet has created a world’s “Most Beautiful Face” ranking annually since 1990.

Takhon was reportedly sentenced to three years in jail with hard labor this week, according to his legal team.

More than 7,000 people have been arrested and more than 1,000 killed in relation to the protests. It began in February following a military coup which saw senior government officials, including civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, detained.

12/30/2021,"When Gabs Amster encounters patients who are frustrated with being overweight, she knows exactly what they are going through. The new critical care nurse — she graduated from the University of South Carolina College of Nursing this month — spent her childhood struggling with extra weight, reaching 210 pounds in her freshman year of high school. Standing 5 feet, 4 inches tall, Amster was considered obese and endured “extreme bullying” by her classmates to the point where she decided to leave her school and be home-schooled for a year. Her weight-loss journey began soon after — when she stepped on the scale during a doctor’s appointment. “The physician actually told me, ‘You’re getting to a point where it’s too much for your body, you’ve got to do something about it.’ I went home that day and it still didn’t hit me,” Amster, who is now 22 and lives in Charlotte, North Carolina, told TODAY. ‘So I asked my mom, ‘Do you think that I’m overweight?’ She’s the type of person who would never say anything wrong about you, but she looked at me and said, ‘It’s time for us to do something about it.’ That’s when it triggered me.” Amster said various family issues led her to overeat throughout her childhood, with food helping her cope with her mental health and boredom. A sedentary lifestyle compounded the problem. But when she was home-schooled for a year, she began to exercise and run. Amster's father helped her get a membership at a gym and she became a regular. “I went every single day until I could run 5 miles” on the treadmill, Amster recalled. “Sometimes it would take me an hour, sometimes it would take me longer, but I wouldn’t get off until I hit that mark.” After each cardio session, she’d alternate exercising her abs, upper or lower body using workouts she’d find online. Next step: changing her diet. Amster’s biggest problem was “carby foods like bread,” she said, so she put herself on what she called “the God diet;” if a food didn’t grow out of the ground or was overly processed, she wouldn’t eat it. The focus was on clean eating, meaning she prioritized whole healthy foods as close as possible to their natural state, like fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats and whole grains. Amster didn’t count calories but tried to be very conscientious about portion sizes. One way she’d decide whether to eat a certain food or not was to watch YouTube videos on how it was made. “If it looked like it went through a long process of trying to become something, I wouldn’t eat it,” she said. The diet and exercise worked: Amster’s weight dropped to 139 pounds. “It didn’t hit me how well I had done until I went back to high school,” she recalled. “The same people who used to bully me introduced themselves to me because they didn’t recognize me.” Amster maintained the weight until she got into university, but the stress of college led her to gain some pounds. The nursing student was trying to get back into a healthy routine and went to the gym every day. Then, the pandemic hit. Amster contracted COVID-19 in June of 2020. She was young and healthy, but still felt short of breath anytime she moved and spent two weeks isolating in a bedroom at her mother’s house. “It was a 6-foot walk to my bathroom and I passed out one time on my way to the restroom,” she recalled. After easing off the exercise for a while, Amster now weighs 165 pounds and her goal is to return to 150. She has resumed going to the gym most days of the week and continues to avoid processed foods, though she’s not as strict as she used to be. Her weakness continues to be the “bread type of situation,” so she tries not to eat bread until dinner and won’t eat a cannoli when her boyfriend does after dinner, Amster said. When Amster is craving sweets or carbs, she remembers her dad’s advice: If you’re not hungry enough for an apple, you’re not hungry enough. “It’s stuck with me ever since,” she noted. “I keep apples on me at all times.” A person won’t be ready to lose weight until they decide to do it for themselves, she added. Amster once worked as an ultrasound technician assistant and often scanned patients with peripheral vascular disease. Most were overweight — some topping 400 pounds — but they still didn’t know how to get into the healthy mindset of “I really need to do better or it’s not going to be good,” she recalled. That’s when she would share her own weight-loss journey because she felt it was important for them to realize that if she could do it, they could, too. “If you’re ready to do it then you need to (ask yourself), what is going to trigger you to be a better you? Is it seeing that you could really hurt yourself if you’re continuing on the track that you’re on? Or is it something that you just really want to do?” Amster said. “For me it was: I just wanted to be a better me.”",Health/TODAY,Nurse loses 70 pounds by focusing on clean eating: ‘I wanted to be a better me’,https://news.yahoo.com/nurse-loses-70-pounds-focusing-145938423.html
12/30/2021,"MEXICO CITY, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Mexico on Tuesday allowed a cruise ship to dock and disembark tourists in spite of an outbreak of COVID-19 on board, as the government vowed to keep the country open to cruise vessels provided sanitary precautions are met. The ship, Ms Zuiderdam, with some 2,000 passengers and crew, docked in the port of Guaymas in the northern state of state of Sonora, state and federal authorities said. In a statement https://www.gob.mx/salud/prensa/con-apego-al-reglamento-sanitario-internacional-de-la-oms-mexico-recibira-cruceros-que-soliciten-atracar-en-puertos-del-pais, the Mexican government said it would accept cruise ships that sought permission to dock as long as World Health Organization international regulations are followed. People infected with COVID-19 on cruise ships who need medical attention will receive it, and milder or asymptomatic cases will be isolated from others on board, it added. Holland America Line, which operates the Zuiderdam, said in a statement that a small number of fully vaccinated crew and passengers on Zuiderdam had tested positive for COVID-19. All showed mild or no symptoms and are in isolation, while their close contacts have been quarantined, it added. Zuiderdam is on a 10-day cruise and would return to San Diego as scheduled on Jan. 2, the statement said. Sonora health minister Jose Luis Alomia told a news conference 30 people had tested COVID-19 positive on the Zuiderdam - 28 crew and two passengers - and were in isolation. Around 400 people had disembarked from the vessel during the morning after proceeding through sanitary filters set up to identify suspected cases of infection, Alomia said. The minister said there were some 1,200 passengers and almost 800 crew on board the Zuiderdam. The government of Mexico, whose economy relies substantially on visitors from abroad for foreign exchange income, has been determined to keep the country open during the pandemic, imposing relatively few restrictions on tourism.
